40|$|The {{equilibrium}} AfSi order-disorder {{relations in}} albite have been clarified by {{reversal of the}} degree of order at high pressures (- 18 kbar) in the absence of water to avoid melting, {{and for the most part}} in the presence of essentially anhydrous carbonates. At high pressuris the Al/Si diffusive interchange proceeds orders of magnitude faster than observed at l- 2 kbar P(HrO). At 18 kbar albite begins to disorder above 660 'C, and the L 2 eG 3 <b>l)</b> <b>indicator</b> of order goes from 1. 10 at 660 &quot;C to 1. 85 (high albite) atTgO&quot;C. The rate ofchange is 9. 1 x l 0 3 A/K in this region of stable intermediate albites. At temperatures from 790 'C to 950 &quot;C disorder in high albite continues essentially linearly with temperature from A: 1. 85 to A '- 2. 0, but at an order of magnitude lower rate of 9. 2 x 10 4 a/K. The pressure effect is calculated at 350 bars/K, and experimental data confirm this value; thus equilibrium orderdisorder temperatures should be 45 - 50 'c lower at 2 kbar thanat lg kbar. Structural state modification is dominantly by the solid-state diffusion of Al and Si. Although both hydrothermal and carbonate-containing runs show some evidence ofrecrystallization, neither added water nor carbonate appear to be essential. For example, relatively rapid ordering or disordering takes place in the absence of fluxes at temperatures of 750 - 1000 &quot;C in albite dried at 1000 &quot;C for 24 hours prior to treatment and in albites treated without carbonate at pressures just below the albite+jadeite * quartz transition. It is tentatively suggested that the observed great enhancement of diffusion at high pressures is the result of activation produced by transient higher coordination induced around Al atoms. with concomitant disruption of the linked Si-O units. This process may be aided by small amounts of water or hydrogen. The low c high albite conversion takes place without change in symmetry (C 1) over several hundred degrees, and ifit can be called a phase transformatiotr, it upp. u [...] not to be first order in nature, at least up to the transition to the monoclinic modificatG, monalbite, at approximatel...|$|E

The analysis is performed separately for three magnetic local time (MLT) sectors (Sector 1 – night sector (01 : 00 – 07 : 00 MLT); Sector 2 – day sector (07 : 00 – 16 : 00 MLT); Sector 3 – evening sector (16 : 00 – 01 : 00 MLT)) and for all MLTs taken together. All <b>L</b> PP <b>indicators</b> suggest the faster plasmapause response in the postmidnight sector.

An excluder plant species (Triticum aestivum <b>L.),</b> an <b>indicator</b> (Trifolium pratense <b>L.),</b> and 3 populations of the Ni-hyperaccumulator Alyssum murale (Waldst. & Kit.) were grown for 90 days on 4 soils with a gradient of concentrations of total and available Ni. Isotopic exchange methods with 63 Ni ions were used to measure the exchangeable soil Ni (E-value, intensity, and capacity factors), to monitor its uptake by plants and to determine the size of the available pool (L-value). Results showed that, for a given soil, the L-values were similar for all plant species, showing that they all access the same Ni exchangeable pool regardless of their Ni uptake capacity. Also, L-values for a given soil were equal to the E-value calculated for a 90 -day period, demonstrating that plant Ni originated from the isotopically exchangeable soil Ni. This pool can be accurately and simply determined with the isotopic exchange kinetic methods run on soil-solution batch systems without plants. Moreover, the results indicate that the plant species take up Ni as a response to "intensity", "capacity", and "quantity" soil factors and that E-value alone is not enough to predict plant uptake. This work suggests a uniform behaviour of the plants tested towards soil Ni and may have practical applications in phytoextraction and phytomining, as the plants removed Ni exclusively from the exchangeable pool...|$|R

A talaj vízoldható szerves-C-tartalma a 15 hetes tenyészidő alatt szignifikánsan nem változott, míg a DON-koncentráció szignifikáns csökkenést mutatott. A mészkőpor alkalmazásakor magasabb DOC-, ill. DON-koncentrációkat mértünk, mint a dolomitkezeléseknél, de ez statisztikailag nem volt igazolható. | The {{effect of}} two {{different}} liming materials (calcite and dolomite) on the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) contents of the soil was investigated in a pot experiment on an acidic sandy soil (Arenosol) using oats (Avena sativa <b>L.)</b> as <b>indicator</b> plant. The major {{physical and chemical properties}} of the soil were as follows: pH(H 2 O) : 4. 38; pH(KCl) : 3. 42; y 1 : 12. 6; Upper limit of plasticity according to Arany (KA) : 31; T (cmol+/kg) : 2. 7; Humusz (...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Pupal {{surveys of}} Aedes aegypti (<b>L.)</b> are useful <b>indicators</b> of risk for dengue transmission, {{although}} sample sizes for reliable estimations can be large. This study explores two methods for making pupal surveys more practical yet reliable and used data from 10 pupal surveys conducted in Puerto Rico during 2004 – 2008. The number of pupae per per-son for each sampling followed a negative binomial distribution, thus showing aggregation. One method found a common aggregation parameter (k) for the negative binomial distribution, {{a finding that}} enabled {{the application of a}} sequential sampling method requiring few samples to determine whether the number of pupae/person was above a vector density threshold for dengue transmission. A second approach used the finding that the mean number of pupae/person is corre-lated with the proportion of pupa-infested households and calculated equivalent threshold proportions of pupa-positive households. A sequential sampling program was also developed for this method to determine whether observed propor-tions of infested households were above threshold levels. These methods can be used to validate entomological thresholds for dengue transmission...|$|R
40|$|The avian eggshell {{represents}} a highly evolved structure {{adapted to the}} physiological requirements of the embryo and the potential fracturing forces it is exposed to during incubation. Given its many roles, {{it is not surprising}} that the eggshell is also central to the current hypothesis about maximum avian body mass. Eggshell thickness (L) and strength has historically been scaled as a function of initial egg mass (IEM). However, maximum incubator mass (IM) is likely a better indicator of the forces the shell must be selected to withstand during incubation. We compare the results of analyses of <b>L</b> 2 (an <b>indicator</b> of shell strength) as a function of IEM and IM. We conclude from IM scaling that megapode and kiwi eggshells are not thin but rather are thicker than expected and in general birds with a clutch size of 1 have thicker shells, and further, that reversed sexual dimorphism in the large, particularly extinct birds may be a strategy to avoid shell breakage during incubation of the largest eggs without creating a shell so thick as to inhibit hatching...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) as stunning method in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar <b>L.)</b> on stress <b>indicators</b> (adrenaline, A; noradrenaline, NAD) and on fillets quality during the shelf life has been investigated. The CO was dissolved into tanks with salmon for 8 and 20 min to obtain fish groups CO 8 and CO 20, respectively. These groups were compared to a non-stressed control group (C). All the fish were hauled out from the tank and killed by percussion. Adrenaline content of CO 20 group was 1. 8 and 1. 7 -fold higher than CO 8 and C groups respectively (P b 0. 001), which exhibited similar values. Noradrenaline content was higher in CO 20 than in C group (8. 1 vs. 5. 4 ng/ml plasma; P b 0. 0001). The CO treatment resulted in a small significant increase in lightness and yellowness, not altering the overall “natural” colour of the fillet. CO treatment caused a rapid onset of rigor mortis and a small but significant increase in drip loss (P b 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|Plant-growth-promoting soil {{microorganisms}} are increasingly distributed {{on the world}} market. Nutrient mobilization, stimulation of root growth, enhanced resistance to envi-ronmental stress factors are discussed as possible mechanisms. These assumptions are based only on scarce scientific evidence due to limited reproducibility of pot and field experiments, limited information concerning the conditions for successful applica-tion, limited standardization of inoculum preparation and quality. Thus, the develop-ment of rapid screening tests is to demonstrate the principle effectiveness of biofertil-izers prior to set-up of labourous pot or field experiments is urgently required. In this study, a rapid bio-test with cucumber (Cucumis sativa <b>L.)</b> as an <b>indicator</b> plant was developed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of five commercial biofertilizers based on Trichoderma spp. and Bacillus spp. (Biohealth-G, Biohealth-WSG, Biomex, Vitalin T 50 and SP 11) using germination rate, root and shoot biomass, maximum root length, and leaf area as test parameters. The experiment was repeated twice with 6 replicates in hydroponic culture under controlled conditions (pH 5. 5, 22 ° C; Light: 230 mmol cm 2 sec- 1).

40|$|Abstract Background Herbaceous {{plants are}} common vegetal species {{generally}} exposed, {{for a limited}} period of time, to bioavailable environmental pollutants. Heavy metals contamination {{is the most common}} form of environmental pollution. Herbaceous plants have never been used as natural bioindicators of environmental pollution, in particular to monitor the amount of heavy metals in soil. In this study, we aimed at assessing the usefulness of using three herbaceous plants (Plantago major L., Taraxacum officinale L. and Urtica dioica L.) and one leguminous (Trifolium pratense <b>L.)</b> as alternative <b>indicators</b> to evaluate soil pollution by heavy metals. Results We employed Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) to assess the concentration of selected heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Mn, Pb, Cr and Pd) in soil and plants and we employed statistical analyses to describe the linear correlation between the accumulation of some heavy metals and selected vegetal species. We found that the leaves of Taraxacum officinale L. and Trifolium pratense L. can accumulate Cu in a linearly dependent manner with Urtica dioica L. representing the vegetal species accumulating the highest fraction of Pb. Conclusions In this study we demonstrated that common plants can be used as an alternative analytical tool for monitoring selected heavy metals in soil. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA new {{description}} is proposed {{of the air}} void structure in air-entrained concretes using a PPV (Protected Paste Volume) parameter. The PPV is determined as a ratio of the paste area protected by air voids to the total paste area, obtained from the 2 D surface measurements. This approach, although constitutes a development of the Philleo concept, {{takes into account the}} number, size and distribution of not only air voids but also aggregate grains, often disregarded by other researchers. The obtained results show that the standard spacing factor L⩽ 0. 20 mm fails to guarantee that 100 percent of the paste volume is protected against the harmful effects of frost, which is the basic assumption in the Powers spacing factor model. The preliminary verification was carried out of the relationships between the parameters L and PPV and the results of freeze–thaw experiments. According to the authors, {{at this stage of the}} study the PPV provides better correlation with the frost resistance results than the standard spacing factor <b>L.</b> Unlike other <b>indicators</b> representing a statistical estimation of the average spacing of air bubbles, the PPV much better reflects the spatial displacement of the air pores in concrete and can thus be considered as an improved factor of air voids spatial dispersion...|$|R
40|$|To {{circumvent}} performance-limiting trade-offs {{encountered in}} the control of linear motion systems, we introduce a method for designing performance-optimal piecewise affine variable-gain feedback controllers. Variable-gain controllers are known to improve upon the performance trade-off between low-frequency tracking {{on the one hand}} and sensitivity to high-frequency disturbances on the other hand. However, the performance-based tuning of such variable-gain controllers is far from trivial. In this paper, we consider a class of variable gain controllers comprising a loop-shaped linear controller and a generic add-on piecewise affine variable gain element. This structure warrants both an intuitive design procedure of the linear part of the control design and a high level of versatility in the design of the nonlinear control part. The add-on piecewise affine control structure introduced in this paper allows for synthesizing the shape of the variable-gain controller by means of either a full model-based optimization approach of a certain L 2 <b>L</b> 2 performance <b>indicator</b> or by extending this approach with data-based elements. As a result, the controller design can be tuned for the disturbance situation at hand while optimizing performance. To illustrate the effectiveness of the approach, the proposed performance-based controller synthesis strategy is demonstrated on an industrial wafer scanner...|$|R

This study investigated the effect of cement dust (CD) applied with two levels i. e. 2. 5 and 5 % on the remediation of Pb, Cd, Ni and Cr in sludge treated soil using the kinetic approach represented by the modified Freundlich, Elovich, the first order, Z(t), and the parabolic diffusion equations through the electrical stirred flow unit (ESFU) technique. Field experiment was also carried out on El-Gabal El-Asfar region to evaluate and assess the potential effect of cement dust by using corn (Zea maize <b>L.)</b> as an <b>indicator.</b> The obtained results showed that application of sludge significantly accumulated and showed increases in studied heavy metals especially in high applied level i. e. 20 m 3. fed- 1 compared with the low level one i. e. 10 m 3 fed- 1. The application of CD showed {{a significant decrease in}} the studied heavy metals represented by the decreasing order of the kinetic parameters of used equations. The fractionation of heavy metals showed that the residual fraction increased compared with other fractions with increasing the applied level of CD material. Also, the remediation success of the studied heavy metals represented by remediatio...|$|R
