[...] He said the episode included great laughs and sublime dramatic moments, including Michael's moment with Holly after the sketch and the silent moment in which Jim learns Pam is pregnant. Sepinwall said Jim's moment of composing himself in the hallway after calling Dwight in that scene was, [...] "Maybe Krasinski's single best moment on the series to date." [...] Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly said she had [...] "some mixed feelings" [...] about the episode and wished it had more from Ryan, Creed and Kelly, but she especially praised the ending scene with Jim and Pam, which she said she did not expect. Dan Hooper of VH1's Best Week Ever said, [...] "Office finale was awesome, as we expected, capping about seven straight weeks of just top-notch episodes with great character moments, a legitimately interesting plot, and just <b>laugh</b> <b>line</b> after <b>laugh</b> <b>line,</b> reminding us all [...] we spent time talking about this show every week."

[...] Eve secretly attempts to kill Alexandra {{several times during}} their childhood. Kate decides to name Eve heir to Kruger-Brent but disinherits her when she discovers Eve's true nature.

Keith threatens to show the photo to the police if Eve doesn't marry him, and although she complies she cheats on him openly with a younger man. Keith refuses to testify at the coroner's inquest and Kate gives Eve an alibi, believing Eve murdered George but thinking she will punish Eve in her own way.

Kate considers this punishment enough. Alexandra marries George's psychiatrist, Dr. Peter Templeton, and they have a son named Robert.|$|E

40|$|Replacement of maxillary {{front teeth}} with a fixed, implant {{supported}} partial denture {{with a high}} <b>laugh</b> <b>line</b> is a demanding procedure. For an optimal esthetic result, no deficiency of bone or soft tissue is acceptable. Submerged implant healing has often been recommended for better predictability in esthetically demanding situations. This case report shows the rehabilitation with a fixed implant supported reconstruction in the upper front and a single implant supported crown in the premolar region. Teeth had to be extracted because of apical lesions, periodontal the gingiva. The technique of delayed, submerged implant placement {{in the region of}} 11, 21 and 22 was applied and in the region of 15 a transmucosal implant healing. With a fixed, implant supported partial denture the mucosa in the upper front was conditioned. Ten months after implantation the definitive screwed, fixed partial denture on SPI ELEMENT implants was successfully integrated. In the region 15 a single crown transversally screwed was fixed on a SPI ONE TIME implant. Radiographic data two years after implantation showed a well established periimplant crestal bone level. No prosthetic complications had occurred since the insertion of the reconstruction twelve months ago...|$|E
