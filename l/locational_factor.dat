We show that projects have a socio-economic effect on the attitude towards regions and contribute to building location brand value. An analysis of group differences shows that the project influence on the region and region attractiveness are perceived in significantly different manner depending on the knowledge level of the stakeholder group.

This paper probes {{the relative importance}} of two potential sources of border effects: (1) pure <b>locational</b> <b>factors,</b> such as transport costs and tariffs; and (2) an inherent disadvantage for a firm selling in a foreign market. I am able to make this decomposition by using data on the local sales of foreign affiliates of US multinational enterprises, on US bilateral exports, and on domestic sales by host-country firms. The "border effect" arises almost entirely from <b>locational</b> <b>factors.</b> If a firm establishes and sells from a subsidiary located in the foreign country, its local sales are about on a par with those of domestic firms in that market.

40|$|Businesses in {{outlying}} regions, particularly {{small and}} medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are having to face a broad range of different challenges in order to maintain their competitiveness. An important input factor has in the past always been the supply of public services. In recent years, public services have undergone a number of radical changes. This paper works on the hypotheses that the market-oriented reorganisation of capacity in the supply of public services has affected outlying regions more than urban centres and led to an increase in economic concentration and regional disparities. The paper has the following objectives: (1) to look at the interconnections between the different aspects of change in the supply of public services and the development of business; (2) to outline the empirical design for analysing the relative significance of supply of services as a dynamic <b>locational</b> <b>factor</b> for businesses in the Swiss Alpine regions. This paper will draw from an ongoing empirical study, but cannot yet indicate policy implications. We will argue that the companies based in outlying regions are affected in two respects by the reduction in public services. On the one hand, the changed provision of public services is becoming more significant for businesses as a hard <b>locational</b> <b>factor</b> and can {{have a negative effect on}} production processes. The main analytical approach to assess firms behaviour within a regional context is the concept of 'regional production systems' (RPS). RPS are characterised by their scope for autonomous decision-making, their coordination mechanisms and their specific resources. The extent to which they are anchored in their particular region influences their capacity for innovation and adaptation to a changing economic context. Thus companies are being forced to react to the dynamic environment and to develop - probably in cooperation with regional public bodies - corresponding response strategies. On the other hand, public services work as soft, person-centred, locational factors that make a major contribution to the quality of life a location has to offer. An deterioration in services means that outlying regions become less attractive as a place to live and consequently it becomes more difficult for companies based there to recruit well-qualified employees. Companies are being forced to react to the dynamic environment and to develop corresponding response strategies. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} links between {{locational}} conditions, innovative capabilities and internationalization of manufacturing SMEs. Two modes of foreign market servicing are explored: exporting activity and relocating of selected business activities abroad. The empirical analysis employs two probit models based on survey of about 3, 000 firms. The results reveal that the outputs of SMEs' innovative activities-i. e., product innovations and patent applications-enhance exporting propensity as expected. Nevertheless, the input-side indicator-R&D intensity-appears to exert no impact. Further, the <b>locational</b> <b>factor</b> proximity to research institutions promotes SMEs' engagement in exporting. Regarding the determinants of selective relocations abroad, the findings show that SMEs {{with a high degree}} of R&D are less likely to separate production from other operations and relocate it abroad. Moreover, manufacturing SMEs assessing the proximity to research facilities, as well as support from various regional authorities and other bodies as important and good-quality locational conditions, exhibit a significantly lower likelihood to relocate selected activities abroad. Indeed, emphasizing the role of institutional setting in firm activity, our findings coincide in this respect with the previous literature focused on innovative milieu, learning regions and regional innovation systems...|$|E
40|$|The ever-changing {{economic}} {{processes in}} the world influence the economic performances of regions both formed by countries and regions within countries. In spite of the dominant view that the developed regions in a globalizing world will expand more, regional development literature accommodates views which assert that rising economic interactions and technological developments will add {{to the development of}} relatively underdeveloped countries in the periphery. On the other hand, studies that analyze regional inequalities show the influence of factor migration. Inter-regional migration of workforce in Turkey is seen as a significant problem due both to the occurrence of new problems in the metropolitan areas and the loss of workforce in underdeveloped regions, it is therefore one of the significant indicators to explain the spatial reflections of economic development.

40|$|Despite {{a growing}} body of {{research}} on firm survival, little is known about the factors impacting upon survival rates at a micro-spatial level. This study, therefore, analyses firm survival across local environments in the context of a peripheral region; namely, the case of Wales in the UK. It examines how theories relating to human capital, growth motivation and locational conditions may explain survival within a region. Drawing on data of survival patterns for a cohort of firms, it is found that each of the three theories at least partly explain firm survival, with it being clear that human capital relating to the experience of entrepreneurs, as well as the growth motivation of their firms resulting from the strategic choices they make, impact upon rates of survival. It is also found that the local environment contributes to the likelihood of its survival. In particular, it is found that <b>locational</b> <b>factors</b> have a potential influence on the human capital allocated to enterprise, as well as how this capital is utilised via growth motivation. This suggests that not only do <b>locational</b> <b>factors</b> contribute to differing rates of entrepreneurship, but that such factors also impact on the durability of firms over time...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a theoretical {{model of the}} trade-offs that an MNE faces when organising its R & D as decentralised or centralised. R & D decentralisation avoids having to adapt centrally developed innovations to local markets, being {{able to use the}} specific know-how of the subsidiary. In addition R & D subsidiaries can be used to source locally available external know-how. At the same time, however, R & D internationalisation intensifies the spillover of valuable know-how to competitors located in the foreign markets. The analysis demonstrates the importance of the intensity of competition in the local market in determining the size of both the benefits and costs of R & D decentralisation. It shows that when R & D is undertaken abroad in association with production, the local knowledge base is not unequivocally a pulling factor attracting R & D investments by foreign MNEs, depending on the level of local competition. The paper also shows that efficiency in reverse intra-company technology transfers is a critical factor in benefiting from technology sourcing. The results thus illustrate the complementarity of efficient internal and external knowledge management systems. In addition the model suggests that, with a fall in the cost of intra-company technology transfers, relative market size loses importance as a <b>locational</b> <b>factor</b> for R & D decentralisation. status: publishe...|$|E

The normal condition of rainfall in Indonesia is represented by Zone of Season (ZOM). ZOM was made by Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) based on homogenity of rainfall pattern in a certain area for 30 years which has clear distinction between dry and rainy season periods. The purpose of this research is to study the effects of locational and topographical factors (slope, elevation, and aspect) towards precipitation in yearly and seasonal (DJF; MAM; JJA; SON) periods in Jawa Tengah and DIY based on ZOM-derived rainfall data for 1981 - 2010.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [122]- 124) Recent {{literature reports}} that the increasing tripchaining behaviors (defined here as linking non-work trips to Journey-to-work trips) are most relevant to the rush-hour traffic of regular large-scale network congestion in metropolitan areas. In order to understand trip-chaining behavior in the three daily peak-hour periods, a conceptualized framework is established through the identification of six endogenous and exogenous determinant sets for trip-chaining propensity: three endogenous determinant sets (Trip Scheduling, Trip Frequency, Trip Mode Choice) and three exogenous determinant sets (Personal Characteristics, Household Structure, and <b>Locational</b> <b>Factor).</b> Based on the above established conceptual framework and the 1990 household travel survey data conducted by the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS), this thesis utilizes a Chi-square Test, an F-Test in discriminant analysis, and logistic regression to analyze and model {{the influence of the}} six determinant sets on the propensity for trip-chaining behavior during morning, noon and afternoon peak periods. The evidence from this study suggests that: First, trip-chaining propensity is associated with, or related to, three endogenous determinant sets. This indicates that chained work trips do trigger more traffic demand than unchained work trips; therefore, they will require more concern in the development of Travel Demand Management (TDM) policy. Second, trip-chaining propensity is associated with, or related to, three exogenous determinant sets. This indicates that chained work trips are more frequently made by those persons or households with particular personal attributes, household structure, and spatial commuting pattern. This finding may be used to improve the prediction of spatial pattern in peak-hour traffic demand. Third, the comparative analysis of trip-chaining propensity aunong three daily peak periods can bridge a gap in previous empirical studies, and thus provide a more systematic understanding of the determinants of tripchaining propensity.

In this paper, empirical findings are presented {{from a variety of}} econometric models that identify several regional characteristics influencing the locational choice of FDI. The main findings are threefold. First, several <b>locational</b> <b>factors</b> appear to be potentially important; these include regional demand, wages, schooling, infrastructure, and agglomeration economies. Second, the effect of agglomeration economies stems from several sources. In particular, the regional presence of agglomerations of manufacturing activity and of foreign-owned manufacturing firms both have an independent positive effect on the locational decision of new FDI. Third, the locational process of maquiladora firms differs from the locational process of overall FDI. The actual findings suggest that regional demand and infrastructure, as suggested above, are "not" important <b>locational</b> <b>factors</b> for export-oriented firms. Furthermore, whereas agglomeration economies from manufacturing and the presence of existing FDI attract new maquiladora investment, the presence of a regional agglomeration of services "deters" the location of new maquiladora firms. Finally, agglomeration economies appear to be more important in the locational process of maquiladora firms. Copyright (c) 2008 Copyright the Authors.

40|$|The {{existence}} of an adequate research- and development-environment {{is seen as a}} <b>locational</b> <b>factor</b> of extraordinary importance for a region. A university of applied sciences as one component of such an environment should be able to influence the innovation behaviour of enterprises positively, although those universities traditionally are noticed as educational institutions. But the education of students can be interpreted as a "supply side effect of those universities, too, because education of students and further education of employees will improve the regions equipment with human capital and so will yield a higher labour productivity. Additionally the transfer of knowledge from science to the entrepreneurial practice is able to increase productivity within the region in question. Another aspect is the strengthening of the adjustment flexibility of regions regarding processes of structural change. The flexibility will be the higher, the higher the qualification level of employees is. The last aspect of universities of applied science in opposite to (ordinary) universities is their stronger regional orientation. The educational supply especially is directed to younger people, who are living in the region. As a result the existing reserves of talents will be exhausted as best as possible.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the motives and locational factors of the Chinese {{foreign direct investment}} in smaller developed economies. The target economies of the study are both Finland and Sweden {{in order to improve}} the generalizability of the results. In the academic literature, foreign direct investments have been studied extensively but the Chinese investment is a relatively new phenomenon which has not been studied much - especially in the small developed economies. In recent years, the Chinese have rapidly increased their foreign investments, so it is increasingly important to understand why the Chinese invest abroad and how the different factors affect their investment decisions about the destination countries. Purpose {{of this study is to}} provide additional information on these issues in the context of small developed economies. The research method of the study is a qualitative multiple-case study which is supported by secondary sources. The secondary sources have been documents, archival materials and statistics, among others. For the study totally 38 Finnish, Chinese and Swedish persons were interviewed representing Chinese enterprises, chambers of commerce, investment promotion organizations, partner as well as other expert organizations. The interviews were conducted as semi-structured and open-ended theme interviews. According to the results, the Chinese invest in the studied small developed economies particularly because of market seeking and strategic asset seeking motives. Market seeking investments have been made mostly by the small family enterprises and high technology companies especially in ICT sector, while strategic asset seeking investments have been made by the advanced Chinese ICT and software corporations. Small developed economies do not possess location-specific advantages which are particularly attractive for the Chinese investments on a global scale. The cost level and taxation are high, natural resources scarce, markets small and the countries are distant from China both geographically and culturally. However, the clusters of the knowledge-intensive sectors attract the large and international Chinese companies. In addition, the Chinese investors are interested in the developed infrastructure as well as high level of education and research. Both the investment motives and location factors are mostly similar in the target economies of the study. The strengths of Sweden have been the active invest-in promotion, broader industrial base as well as long trade relations with China.

40|$|International audienceAccording to the {{mainstream}} literature in economic geography, agglomeration economies are so powerful drivers for polarization in the larger metro areas that a center-periphery pattern is almost inescapable, making any peripheral location clearly disadvantageous for firms (Dicken and Lloyd, 1992; Fujita and Thisse, 2003). Urban studies also support such views by demonstrating the growing, steadily trend towards metropolization. However these statements are not fully confirmed by some empirical results. Indeed the stated entrepreneurs’ locational preferences of firms localized in medium-sized (and even small) cities situated in peripheral areas do not always meet these theoretical interpretations. Innovative entrepreneurs and successful companies are usual in such locations, making necessary to explain such unexpected location choices {{and how they can}} be successful despite their so-called locational constraints due both to their remote position in badly connected peripheries (as demonstrated by population and economic potential models at the national and European scales) and to the lack of localized external economies of scale. To enlighten such apparently irrational business location choices, we could refer to the behavioural approach (Pred, 1967) as the perception of the quality of location characteristics has been neglected by the literature (Eickelpasch and al., 2015). Indeed the mental maps of the peripheral entrepreneurs –as revealed by our survey– do not exhibit the same perception of their working-area as expected from the theoretical works that consider peripheral locations are damaging due to various backwash effects (Myrdal, 1957; Haggett, 1979). As it has often been established by numerous surveys, the first <b>locational</b> <b>factor</b> of SMEs is often the birthplace of their manager, especially for family-owned companies, considering that entrepreneurial spirit is often more common in areas dominated by small firms (Baudelle and Ollivro, 2000; Ejermo and Hansen, 2015). Therefore the rationale of their location choice does not necessarily match the requisites of profit maximization. But despite this kind of path dependency due to the faithfulness of these entrepreneurs to their native region, we need to understand how such firms can be innovative and therefore successful notwithstanding their non- optimal location in small and medium-sized cities of peripheral areas. At this point we need another theoretical framework, namely the institutional approach (Granovetter, 1973). This perspective is required to explain why and how entrepreneurs can be successful in spite of their non-metropolitan location in modest cities situated far not only from the core of Europe but also from the national and sub-national metropolises. More specifically our study mobilizes the sociology of networks (Krauss, 2011 & 2013) to explain the paradoxical success-stories of peripheral firms. Such an approach is congruent with the evolutionary perspective that is paying more and more attention (but not so much) to networks and institutions as parts of complex adaptative systems to explain regional resilience (Boschma, 2015). Therefore our theoretical assumption is the following: professional networks and personal networking are crucial for these companies and their managers to give them access to various kinds of resources that are necessary to run their business. This is consistent with the theory striking the need for embeddeness among the entrepreneurs to make them possible to run their business with success (Granovetter, 1973; Krauss, Sternberg, 2014). The final goal of the study is to understand how the access to various informational and human resources is made possible by the construction of networks used by innovating companies to develop their business. Consequently the objective is to identify the configuration of the networks –strong or weak, local or distant, central or peripheral– of the interviewed entrepreneurs to understand their possible role in their success stories. The field-study area is a corridor along the Southern Brittany Coast (France). In this area of about 939 000 inhab., there is no large metropolis. The three main cities (Lorient, Quimper, Vannes) are simply medium-sized cities: their built-up areas have respectively 115 000, 80 000 and 75 000 inhab. only and their travel-to-work areas 180 000, 120 000 and 135 000 people. Outside them, only small cities can be found. Moreover these cities are far from the rest of France and Europe and even from the larger metro area in Western France, Nantes (622 000 inh.), which is more than 3 hours away by car from Western Brittany and even 4 hour and a half by train. Even from the closest city (Vannes) the journey to Nantes requires more than 2 hours. Paris, the national capital-city, remains from 3 h 30 to 6 h 30 away by train. Some local domestic airports compensate this remoteness but not totally and with a high flight cost due to monopolies. As a result this area is a typical periphery, far from the metropolitan engines of the globalizing economy. The French division of labour between Paris metro area and the province even worsens the gap between the Breton Western periphery and the French World City. To understand how the entrepreneurs overcome such a physical distance, a sample of about 20 successful business leaders were interviewed (Marinos, 2015). The selected companies (mainly SMEs) are deliberately very competitive ones: they are intensive in technology, exhibit a high level of innovation (as demonstrated by the number of patents) allowing high added values and significant export rates, they attract international investors and look for clients and suppliers all around the world. The objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate how important the networks are to compensate the possible theoretical locational constraints due to peripheral sites (Krauss, 2009). The literature often points out the possible negative locking effects of excessive local inward-looking ties, suggesting a trade-off between immediate adaptation and later adaptability (Grabher, 1993; Boschma and Frenken, 2010; Braun and Schulz, 2012; Boschma, 2015). However our study shows clearly that such a distinction between strong local, proximate connections and weak, outward-looking networks does not fit with our empirical results, which leads to reconsider the present literature about the connectedness of entrepreneurs working in peripheries seen as so-called autarkic and poorly connected places. The survey reveals that the entrepreneurs do not ignore the drawbacks of peripheral locations. However the professionals met for the survey express great satisfaction about their business in Southern Brittany. The participation of three quarters of them in local networks (business associations, chambers of commerce, development agencies [...] .) is presented as necessary for their business development process, and even crucial during the start-up stage. It allows them to open up to their immediate environment and to enhance their external visibility. Belonging to a network also improves their collective capacity for concerted actions. Doing so, entrepreneurs become more audible by politicians and influence local public policies. Small and medium-sized cities are perceived as a favorable ground to confident relationships even if that kind of links rarely exceeds the TTWA boundaries. Local political staff and administration are more easily approachable and quicker to react than in bigger cities. More surprisingly, these employers are involved in the local economic life even if their clients are not local. The more entrepreneurs operate on the globalized market, the more they express that need for local commitment: “my company needs roots to have wings”. The local territory acts as a medium between stakeholders: “partnerships, collaborations, it is first and foremost a human-based process”. A collaborative way of working is considered essential. The importance of trusting is at the heart of networks' efficiency because it facilitates the exchanges and improves the flow of information. The information quality control is operated by network members. Immaterial resources access constitutes a favorable ground for entrepreneur’s social capital. Thisaccess opportunity participates to the process of innovation. Therefore mutual trust can be regarded as an implicit knowledge transmission accelerator that fosters innovation. Higher education (including alumni associations) is complementarily highly structuring for entrepreneurs’ networks, offering good opportunities to develop sustainable partnerships. When they exist, links with experts and academic researchers are sustainable and lead to success. These relations take time and depend on the leader’s background. They vary a lot according to how long the company has been based on the territory. However most of the local research fields are different from those which are of interest to local companies to such an extent that some companies prefer working with metropolitan research organizations, particularly for those which operate in niche activities. In terms of cooperation, employers display a very pragmatic behavior: they get to the closest companies, sometimes even at the expense of the quality of the resource. Geographic proximity fosters working together, a round trip in the afternoon being considered as the symbolic border. This is particularly true for interpersonal networks, restricted to everyday life territory. But for commercial partnerships there is no geographic border. Eventually these networks are helpful to overcome some challenges such as hiring talented employees or getting a convenient job for their partners in small TTWAs. But they do not solve all the usual problems the peripheral entrepreneurs face to such as good air connectivity within an hour drive (“If the airport closes, I leave”). Moreover the companies operating in specialized activities or in a niche productions do suffer from the lack of dense sectorial networks, generating a feeling of isolation. This can impact the open innovation process and even inhibit the organization of events supposed to provide new interactions. Finally the network approach helps to understand why companies located in peripheral areas do not move towards larger central metro areas despite of their locational disadvantage underlined by the neoclassic locational theory...|$|E
