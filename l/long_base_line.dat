The initial position of the transponders is determined by USBL and/ or by measuring the baselines between the transponders. Once that is done, only the ranges to the transponders need to be measured to determine a relative position. The position should theoretically be located at the intersection of imaginary spheres, one around each transponder, with a radius equal to the time between transmission and reception multiplied by the speed of sound through water. Because angle measurement is not necessary, the accuracy in large water depths is better than USBL.|$|E

40|$|Radio {{interferometry}} promises {{eventually to}} measure directly, with accuracies {{of a few}} centimeters, both whole earth motions and relative crustal motions with respect to an 'inertial' reference frame. Interferometry measurements of arbitrarily <b>long</b> <b>base</b> <b>lines</b> require, however, {{the development of new}} techniques for independent-station observation. In connection with the development of such techniques, a series of short <b>base</b> <b>line</b> demonstration experiments has been conducted between two antennas. The experiments were related to a program involving the design of independent-station instrumentation capable of making three-dimensional earth-fixed <b>base</b> <b>line</b> measurements with an accuracy of a few centimeters.

50|$|From 1876 to 1886, he had {{charge of}} the main {{triangulation}} and astronomical work on the west coast; {{the records of the}} computing division showed that the results of his observations stood higher than any ever executed in America, Europe, or India, and they were characterized as “unique in the history of geodesy.” In 1881, Davidson twice measured the Yolo <b>base</b> <b>line,</b> one of the geodesic <b>base</b> <b>lines</b> that formed the foundation of triangulating distances in California. At that time, it was the <b>longest</b> <b>base</b> <b>line</b> yet attempted in trigonometrical operations, and the system of triangulation directly connected therewith was called in his honor the “Davidson quadrilaterals.” He also measured the Los Angeles <b>base</b> <b>line</b> three times in 1888-1889. He retired from the Coast Survey in 1895, after 50 years of service.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} physics {{opportunities to}} constraint leptonic CP-violation phase δ_CP through numerical analysis of working neutrino oscillation probability parameters, {{in the context}} of <b>long</b> <b>base</b> <b>line</b> experiments. Numerical analysis of two parameters, the " transition probability δ_CP phase sensitivity parameter (A^M) " and " CP-violation probability δ_CP phase sensitivity parameter (A^CP) ", as function of beam energy and/or base line has been preferably carried out. It is an elegant technique to broadly analyze different experiments to constraint δ_CP phase and also to investigate mass hierarchy in the leptonic sector. The positive and negative values of parameter A^CP corresponding to either of hierarchy in the specific beam energy ranges, could be a very promising way to explore mass hierarchy and δ_CP phase. The keys to more robust bounds on δ_CP phase are improvements of the involved detection techniques to explore bit low energy and relatively <b>long</b> <b>base</b> <b>line</b> regions with better experimental accuracy...|$|E

One of these scenarios is the evolution of the sdB progenitor within a binary system. We have looked systematically at bright sdB stars from the PG survey. By taking spectra at several different epochs we have measured the radial velocity shifts caused by the motion of the sdB star within the binary.

40|$|The part of {{the grant}} was to use {{recordings}} of seismic waves travelling through the earth's core (PKP waves) to study the inner core rotation and constraints on possible density anomalies in the fluid core. The shapes and relative arrival times of such waves associated with a common source were used to reduce the uncertainties in source location and excitation {{and the effect of}} unknown mantle structure. The major effort of the project is to assemble historical seismograms with <b>long</b> observing <b>base</b> <b>lines.</b> We have found original paper records of SSI earthquakes at COL between 1951 and 1966 in a warehouse of the U. S. Geological Survey office in Golden, Colorado, extending the previous measurements at COL by Song and Richards [1996] further back 15 years. Also in Alaska, the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Geophysical Institute (UAFGI) has been operating the Alaskan Seismic Network with over 100 stations since the late 1960 s. Virtually complete archives of seismograms are still available at UAFGI. Unfortunately, most of the archives are in microchip form (develocorders), for which the use of waveforms is impossible. Paper seismograms (helicorders) are available for a limited number of stations, and digital recordings of analog signals started around 1989. Of the paper records obtained, stations at Gilmore Dome (GLM, very close to COL), Yukon (FYU), McKinley (MCK), and Sheep Creek Mountain (SCM) have the most complete continuous recordings...|$|R
