40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relation}} between movements in the U. S. price level and the dollar price levels of nineteen other countries. Using the band pass filter developed by Christiano and Fitzgerald (2003), we examine correlations between dollar prices when decomposed into their high, medium, and <b>low</b> frequency <b>cycles.</b> The <b>low</b> frequency <b>cycle</b> in the U.

The high correlation between <b>low</b> frequency <b>cycles</b> persists over a variety of historical sub-periods, including the eras of fixed and flexible nominal exchange rates. This result, suggesting the existence of a common long-run price cycle, is consistent with long-run purchasing power parity. In contrast, both high and medium frequency cycles are more highly correlated prior to the Great Depression. This result is consistent with studies finding greater stability of real exchange rates during the era of the gold standard. Also, it appears that the increased volatility of U. S. real exchange rates after the 1973 move to flexible exchange rates was largely due to declines in the co-movement of short-run dollar price cycles. ...|$|R

In this paper, we present our own Distributed <b>Low</b> Duty <b>Cycle</b> MAC (DLDC-MAC) protocol, which achieves a {{lifetime of}} two years using off-the-shelf sensor nodes. Our protocol synchronizes wake-up times of nodes in a fully decentralized way, even when plenty of transmitted packets get lost. We evaluated this in a real world scenario with 10 sensor nodes working for 14 days in our office space. Interestingly, the experiment showed that direct communication over long distances led to very high packet error rate, sometimes higher than 30 %. In that case, multi-hop transmission delivered data with much higher reliability, with packet error rate close to 0 %...|$|R

40|$|Sparse {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) {{are emerging}} as an effective solution {{for a wide range}} of applications, especially for environmental monitoring. In many scenarios, a moderate number of sparsely deployed nodes can be sufficient to get the required information about the sensed phenomenon. To this end, special mobile elements, i. e. mobile data collectors (MDCs), can be used to get data sampled by sensor nodes. In this paper we present an analytical evaluation of the data collection performance in sparse WSNs with MDCs. Our main contribution is the definition of a flexible model which can derive the total energy consumption for each message correctly transferred by sensors to the MDC. The obtained energy expenditure for data transfer also accounts for the overhead due to the MDC detection when sensor nodes operate with a <b>low</b> duty <b>cycle.</b> The results show that a <b>low</b> duty <b>cycle</b> is convenient and allows a significant amount of correctly received messages, especially when the MDC moves with a low speed.
