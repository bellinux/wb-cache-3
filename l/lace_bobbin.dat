50|$|By 1870, {{virtually}} {{every type of}} hand-made lace (pillow <b>lace,</b> <b>bobbin</b> lace) had its machine-made copy. It became increasingly difficult for hand lacemakers {{to make a living}} from their work and most of the English handmade lace industry had disappeared by 1900.|$|E
50|$|Synopsis: In 1986, four Catalan {{scientists}} Agustí Julià, Joan Rovira, Josefina Castellví and Antoni Ballester {{managed to}} reach Antarctica {{with the project}} of planting their tent on Deception Island to force the Spanish state to join the Antarctic Treaty, which would eventually happen in 1988, and lay a foundation. The leader of the expedition, Dr. Antoni Ballester, would end up suffering a stroke that led Josefina Castellví to take over and run the small facility {{at a time when}} resources were quite limited for the Antarctic program. That was how she became the first female head of a foundation in the history of international Antarctic research. After retiring, she devotes her time to <b>lace</b> <b>bobbin</b> and gardening, her two passions today, but the photos hanging on the wall of her house and her collection of miniature penguins ensure the memory of her greatest adventure. In addition, she finds the suitcase with 30 hours’ worth of film she had captured herself during her first years on the white continent. Because of this and the pressure of nostalgia, Josefina decided to return to Antarctica.|$|E

50|$|Mesh {{grounded}} lace is {{a continuous}} <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> {{also known as}} straight <b>lace.</b> Continuous <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> is made in one piece on a lace pillow.

This is different to part lace, where the motifs are created separately, then joined together afterwards.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPeniche's <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> {{has been}} a victim of the lack of demand for the product and the {{decrease}} of artisans who wish to manufacture it. The <b>Bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> is primarily generated on a small scale and most of the times for personal consumption. Apart from a few occasional orders these are the reasons that still maintain the artisanal production of <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace.</b> Identifying the problem of discontinuity of traditions and the lack of framing of these with contemporaneity arises combined with the remoteness of younger generations. In what design can it contribute to change this mercantile perspective?Getting the lace makers motivated for the production of different types of <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace,</b> using new materials, preserving {{at the same time the}} cultural heritage, it will be, in our opinion, one of the opportunities to reverse its decline status. We also believe on developing contemporary products to appeal the younger consumers, we’ll be capable of doing a direct association with <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace.</b> Therefore, the <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> could be associated to other components outside the textile context by creating objects with materials like iron, plastic or rubber, not merely ornamental, but useful to the eyes of the final consumer. This resignification of the <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> appeals to another meaning, more contemporary than the usual napro...|$|R

50|$|The {{making of}} <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> {{was easier to}} learn than the {{elaborate}} cutwork of the 16th century, and the tools and materials for making linen <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> were inexpensive. There was a ready market for <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> of all qualities, and women throughout Europe soon took up the craft which earned a better income than spinning, sewing, weaving or other home-based textile arts. Bobbin lace-making was established in charity schools, almshouses, and convents.|$|R

40|$|<b>Bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> is a fibre {{art form}} in which {{intricate}} and delicate patterns are created by braiding together many threads. An overview of how <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> is made is presented and illustrated with a simple, traditional bookmark design. Research on the topology of textiles and braid theory form a base for the current work and is briefly summarized. We define a new mathematical model that supports the enumeration and generation of <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> patterns using an intelligent combinatorial search. Results of this new approach are presented and, by comparison to existing <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> patterns, it is demonstrated that this model reveals new patterns {{that have never been}} seen before. Finally, we apply our new patterns to an original bookmark design and propose future areas for exploration.

5000|$|The {{forerunner of}} {{bobbinet}} tulle was <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace.</b> Lace has been produced {{for a long}} time, made in tedious hand labour with thin thread and needles or <b>bobbins.</b> <b>Bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> is made by weaving the threads by moving the bobbins over or under each other. Much <b>bobbin</b> <b>lace</b> {{is based on a}} net ground. By the end of the 18th century, people tried to produce the net ground mechanically. In 1765 they managed to create a tulle-like fabric on a so-called stocking framework. It took, however, some more years until the first real tulle could be produced mechanically.|$|R
