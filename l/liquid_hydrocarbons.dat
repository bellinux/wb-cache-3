5|$|Voyager 1s mission {{included}} a flyby of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which {{had long been}} known to have an atmosphere. Images taken by Pioneer 11 in 1979 had indicated the atmosphere was substantial and complex, further increasing interest. The Titan flyby occurred as the spacecraft entered the system to avoid any possibility of damage closer to Saturn compromising observations, and approached to within , passing behind Titan as seen from Earth and the Sun. Voyager's measurement of the atmosphere's effect on sunlight, and Earth-based measurement of {{its effect on the}} probe's radio signal were used to determine the atmosphere's composition, density, and pressure. Titan's mass was also measured by observing its effect on the probe's trajectory. Thick haze prevented any visual observation of the surface, but the measurement of the atmosphere's composition, temperature, and pressure led to speculation that lakes of <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> could exist on the surface.|$|E

40|$|The direct {{conversion}} of methane to <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> {{has not yet}} been successfully implemented in an economical process. Bimetallic zeolites showed reasonable activities for the formation of higher hydrocarbons from methane. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to modify zeolite with combine metal, copper and nickel for methane conversion into <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> C. The catalysts are characterized for their physicochemical properties using the Fourier Transmitter IR Analysis (FTIR), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The characterization result reveals that IR spectra indicating the presence of similar structural units and formation of identical chemical moieties of the modified zeolite samples. From XRD analysis, it is found that the synthesized modified zeolite posses a high crystallinite structure and small particle size, around 3. 7 Å. TGA find that the modified zeolite catalyst is suitable for reaction in the temperature range 2000 C to 70005 +C due to its high thermal stability. Methane conversion to <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> is predicted to increase due to loading of bi-metal Copper and Nickel. This research suggest that further studies on the catalytic performance of bi-metal for {{direct conversion}} of methane to <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> should be done to make this research more complete. -Autho...|$|R

25|$|Ethanol is hygroscopic, {{meaning it}} absorbs water vapor {{directly}} from the atmosphere. Because absorbed water dilutes the fuel value of the ethanol and may cause phase separation of ethanol-gasoline blends (which causes engine stall), containers of ethanol fuels must be kept tightly sealed. This high miscibility with water means that ethanol cannot be efficiently shipped through modern pipelines, like <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> over long distances.|$|E
25|$|Porco's {{team was}} {{responsible}} for the first sighting of a hydrocarbon lake, as well as a lake district, in the south polar region of Titan in June 2005. (A group of similar – and larger – features were sighted in the north polar region in February 2007.) The possibility that these sea-sized features are either completely or partially filled with <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> is significantly strengthened by subsequent observations by other Cassini instruments.|$|E
25|$|Pipeline {{industry}} spokesmen {{have noted}} that {{thousands of miles of}} existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, in southeast Wyoming, eastern Colorado and New Mexico, western Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The Pioneer crude oil pipeline crosses east-west across Nebraska, and the Pony Express pipeline, which crosses the Ogallala Aquifer in Colorado, Nebraska, and Kansas, was being converted as of 2013 from natural gas to crude oil, under a permit from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.|$|E

25|$|Thermonuclear thinking: The most {{dramatic}} proposal for in situ production from deep oil sand deposits came from Richfield Oil Company. In 1959 Richfield suggested an experimental plan to release <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> from the sand through the expedient of an underground nuclear explosion. The company proposed detonating a 9-kiloton explosive device below the oil sands {{at a site}} 100 kilometres south of Fort McMurray. Thermonuclear heat would create a large underground cavern and simultaneously liquefy the oil. The cavern {{could serve as a}} collection point for the now-fluid oil, enabling the company to produce it.|$|E
25|$|Mineral oil {{includes}} hydrocarbon oil, liquefied petroleum gas, substitute fuel, and additives. Hydrocarbon oil includes petroleum oil, oil {{produced from}} coal, bituminous substances, and <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> but not substances that are solid or semi-solid at 15°C In {{addition to the}} tax, a carbon charge is applicable to petrol, aviation gasoline, and heavy oil used as a propellant, for air navigation, or for private pleasure navigation, and this {{was scheduled to be}} extended in May 2010 to apply to other uses of heavy oil and liquefied petroleum gas, and to natural gas.|$|E
25|$|Hot {{water from}} the {{treatment}} plant was circulated in small-bore pipes alongside the pipeline to reduce heat losses and potential hydrate formation, an ice-like substance that can cause blockages. At the Pickering treatment plant raw gas was routed through a slug catcher and inlet separator to remove <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and water. Gas flowed to two parallel vetrocoke absorbers where it was washed with a counter-current aqueous solution of soda ash and arsenic compounds to convert the hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur. Gas then flowed to a hydrocarbon recovery unit where it was chilled to remove further <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> the dry sulphur-free gas passed through a British Gas metering station to Feeder No. 6 of the National Transmission System which passes through Pickering. The sulphur-rich solution from the absorbers was routed to oxidiser regenerators where air was bubbled through the solution to remove the sulphur {{in the form of}} a froth. The froth was dried in a rotary vacuum filter and heated in an autoclave to allow removal of impurities prior to being stored in tanks at about 130°C from where it was removed by heated road tanker. The regenerated absorber solution from the oxidisers, together with recovered solution from the vacuum filters, was returned for reuse in the vetrocoke absorbers. Hydrocarbon liquids were routed to condensate stabilizers and then to storage tanks for removal by road tanker.|$|E

40|$|Application of {{a method}} of {{absolute}} calibration relating to gas chromatography analysis of <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> samples is considered. It is shown for this task that both from theoretical, and practical points of view the optimum concentration unit is mass (not molar) fraction. Information on average molar mass of the analyzed sample {{is necessary for the}} determination of analytes in <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> samples in terms of mole fraction. Meanwhile, the normative documents of rather high rank (ASTM, ISO, GOST, GOST R) concerning methods of the determination of average molar weight of samples of such a kind are absent...|$|R
50|$|In 1946, {{the town}} {{was the site of}} a Fischer-Tropsch plant capable of {{producing}} <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fuels. Seven scientists brought into the United States by Operation Paperclip from Nazi Germany took part in the research.|$|R
25|$|Large {{bodies of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> {{are thought to}} be present on the surface of Titan, {{although}} they are not large enough to be considered oceans and are sometimes referred to as lakes or seas. The Cassini–Huygens space mission initially discovered only what appeared to be dry lakebeds and empty river channels, suggesting that Titan had lost what surface liquids it might have had. Cassini's more recent fly-by of Titan offers radar images that strongly suggest hydrocarbon lakes exist near the colder polar regions. Titan is thought to have a subsurface liquid-water ocean under the ice and hydrocarbon mix that forms its outer crust.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, a new {{gas plant}} at Taylor, near Fort St. John, British Columbia, began {{supplying}} Westcoast Transmission Co. Ltd. This plant's practices differed from {{those used in}} Alberta {{in a number of}} ways. For example, although it generally required dehydration, sweetening and processing for <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> companies transported the natural gas from northeastern British Columbia long distances before processing it further. Consequently, while planning the Westcoast pipeline, the field operators agreed to process all the gas at a single facility, rather than have individual gas plants in every major production area. At 10 million cubic metres per day, the Taylor plant had the capacity to process as much natural gas as all eleven of the other gas plants operating in Canada combined. The plant was also by far Canada's most northerly. Heavily insulated buildings protected the processing facilities and allowed them to function at temperatures typical of more southerly climes.|$|E
500|$|The {{oil shale}} {{industry}} {{is an industry}} of mining and processing of oil shale—a fine-grained sedimentary rock, containing significant amounts of kerogen (a solid mixture of organic chemical compounds), from which <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> can be manufactured. The industry has developed in Brazil, China, Estonia {{and to some extent}} in Germany and Russia. Several other countries are currently conducting research on their oil shale reserves and production methods to improve efficiency and recovery. [...] However, Australia has halted their pilot projects due to environmental concerns. Estonia accounted for about 70% of the world's oil shale production in a study published in 2005.|$|E

40|$|A {{process and}} {{apparatus}} are described for producing hydrogen-rich product gases. A spray of <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> {{is mixed with}} a stream of air in a startup procedure and the mixture is ignited for partial oxidation. The stream of air is then heated by the resulting combustion to reach a temperature such that a signal is produced. The signal triggers a two way valve which directs <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> from a spraying mechanism to a vaporizing mechanism with which a vaporized hydrocarbon is formed. The vaporized hydrocarbon is subsequently mixed with the heated air in the combustion chamber where partial oxidation takes place and hydrogen-rich product gases are produced...|$|R

500|$|Oil shale is an organic-rich {{fine-grained}} {{sedimentary rock}} containing kerogen (a solid mixture of organic chemical compounds) from which <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> called shale oil (not {{to be confused}} with tight oil—crude oil occurring naturally in shales) can be produced. [...] Shale oil is a substitute for conventional crude oil; however, extracting shale oil from oil shale is more costly than the production of conventional crude oil both financially and in terms of its environmental impact. [...] Deposits of oil shale occur around the world, including major deposits in the United States. A 2016 estimate of global deposits set the total world resources of oil shale equivalent of [...] of oil in place.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} images of Titan's surface taken by Earth-based telescopes {{in the early}} 2000s, large regions of dark terrain were {{revealed}} straddling Titan's equator. Prior {{to the arrival of}} Cassini, these regions were thought to be seas of <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Radar images captured by the Cassini spacecraft have instead revealed some of these regions to be extensive plains covered in longitudinal dunes, up to [...] high about a kilometer wide, and tens to hundreds of kilometers long. Dunes of this type are always aligned with average wind direction. In the case of Titan, steady zonal (eastward) winds combine with variable tidal winds (approximately 0.5 meters per second). The tidal winds are the result of tidal forces from Saturn on Titan's atmosphere, which are 400 times stronger than the tidal forces of the Moon on Earth and tend to drive wind toward the equator. This wind pattern, it was theorized, causes granular material on the surface to gradually build up in long parallel dunes aligned west-to-east. The dunes break up around mountains, where the wind direction shifts.|$|E

50|$|Microwave {{technology}} utilises {{the higher}} permittivity of water than hydrocarbons {{to detect the}} overall water fraction in the liquid and gas phases. As it only detects and measures the water component, the <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> component must be measured by another method.|$|R
50|$|The {{extraction}} of <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fuel from sedimentary basins {{is integral to}} modern energy development. Hydrocarbons are mined from oil sands and oil shale, and potentially extracted from sedimentary methane hydrates. These reserves require distillation and upgrading to produce synthetic crude and petroleum.|$|R
5000|$|Natural gas {{is lighter}} than <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon.</b> Minute {{particles}} of <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> that are temporarily suspended {{in a stream}} of natural gas will, by density difference or force of gravity, settle out of the stream of gas if the velocity of the gas is sufficiently slow. The larger droplets of hydrocarbon will quickly settle out of the gas, but the smaller ones will take longer. At standard conditions of pressure and temperature, the droplets of <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> may have a density 400 to 1,600 times that of natural gas. However, as the operating pressure and temperature increase, the difference in density decreases. At an operating pressure of 800 psig, the <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> may be only 6 to 10 times as dense as the gas. Thus, operating pressure materially affects {{the size of the}} separator and the size and type of mist extractor required to separate adequately the liquid and gas. The fact that the liquid droplets may have a density 6 to 10 times that of the gas may indicate that droplets of liquid would quickly settle out of and separate from the gas. However, this may not occur because the particles of liquid may be so small that they tend to [...] "float" [...] in the gas and may not settle out of the gas stream in the short period of time the gas is in the oil and gas separator. As the operating pressure on a separator increases, the density difference between the liquid and gas decreases. For this reason, it is desirable to operate oil and gas separators at as low a pressure as is consistent with other process variables, conditions, and requirements.|$|R

2500|$|The {{first of}} these new plants was Imperial's Leduc {{facility}} (sometimes called [...] Imperial Devon or Imperial Leduc). It sweetened the gas with monoethanolamine (MEA), then extracted the <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> by refrigeration. Northwestern Utilities Limited bought the gas at $14.12 per thousand cubic metres and distributed it in Edmonton. Trucks transported the propane, butane and [...] "pentanes plus" [...] (the Canadian term for heavier gas liquids) until 1954, when three pipelines began moving the products from Imperial Leduc to Edmonton. When markets {{could not be found}} for the propane, the board occasionally granted permission to flare it.|$|E
