40|$|One of {{the main}} reasons that <b>leasing</b> is a {{financial}} alternative so popular in the world is the one that synthesize its own „philosophy”: It’s not ownership of the assets but their effective use is the one leading to profit. The key aspect is the proper use of capital resources: the investment of money in what generates „business” and brings profit, like publicity, the superior qualification of the staff, stocks, exploring new markets, research, development, instead of blocking them by purchasing fixed assets. This article aims to approach the <b>leasing</b> as a source or as a financing alternative investments, to highlight the benefits given by that to the three parties involved in a <b>lease</b> - the lessee or the user of the <b>lease,</b> the lessee or the <b>leasing</b> company and the good or the assets supplier which are the subject <b>lease.</b> There are also the main modern forms of <b>leasing</b> which are more common in business finance. <b>leasing,</b> investment, lessor, financial <b>leasing,</b> operating <b>leasing,</b> full pay out <b>leasing,</b> cross-border <b>leasing,</b> buy and <b>lease,</b> sale and <b>lease</b> back, cession-bail, <b>leasing</b> adosse, experimental <b>leasing,</b> time-sharing <b>leasing,</b> renting, credit-bail d’actions, master <b>leasing,</b> wet-lease, leveraged <b>lease.</b> ...|$|R

In legal terms, verbal farm <b>leases</b> in Nebraska may be either 2 ̆ 2 year-to-year 2 ̆ 2 <b>leases</b> or 2 ̆ 2 holdover 2 ̆ 2 <b>leases.</b> Holdover <b>leases</b> result when a written <b>lease</b> terminates but the landlord and tenant continue the <b>lease</b> with an oral agreement, either directly or implied, without entering into a new written <b>lease.</b> The most common legal issue associated with verbal farm <b>leases</b> is how a <b>lease</b> may legally be terminated. For both year-to-year <b>leases</b> and holdover <b>leases,</b> six months advance notice {{must be given to}} legally terminate the <b>lease.</b> However, the <b>lease</b> date (the date from which the six months is counted) is different.

Most Nebraska <b>leases</b> are unwritten, {{which means that}} notice of termination must be given six months in advance, usually by August 31. If the landlord cannot terminate the <b>lease,</b> the landlord cannot require the tenant to renegotiate the <b>lease</b> {{in order to avoid}} <b>lease</b> termination. However, smart tenants would renegotiate the <b>lease</b> with the landlord {{in order to keep the}} <b>lease</b> longer.

40|$|A {{model of}} the term {{structure}} of <b>lease</b> rates in a frictionless economy is developed and its predictions are compared with data on residential <b>leases</b> in Japan.

More importantly, the term structure of <b>lease</b> rates is always upward-sloping for cancellable <b>leases.</b> Empirical findings show a sharp contrast with the theory. Fixed-term <b>lease</b> rates are often higher than open-ended long-term <b>lease</b> rates.
