5000|$|Power for the Zeppelin NT's {{propulsion}} systems {{is provided by}} a trio of [...] Textron Lycoming IO-360 boxer aviation engines, fueled by standard aviation gasoline. These engines are mounted on the sides and rear of the structure itself to provide optimum efficiency; this arrangement also increases in-flight comfort due to reduced levels of propeller noise and vibration. In addition to thrust, each engine also provides maneuverability via their swiveling propellers; the two forward engines are equipped with hydraulically-actuated tilting propellers which are usually aligned horizontally, but can be turned 90° upward or 30° downward, while the aft engine powers a fixed <b>lateral</b> <b>propeller.</b> Each engine is furnished with separate fuel tanks and supply systems that typically operate independently of one another.|$|E

They looked, like big box-kites of an exaggerated form, soaring at the ends of invisible cords. They had long, square heads and flattened tails, with <b>lateral</b> <b>propellers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Propulsion was {{achieved}} through three propellers: two outboard or wing propellers had three blades, while the central propeller had four. The two <b>lateral</b> <b>propellers</b> were powered by reciprocating steam triple expansion, while the central shaft {{was driven by}} a steam turbine. All power on board was derived from a total of 29 coal-fired steam boilers in six compartments. However, Olympics boilers were adapted for firing by oil {{at the end of}} the First World War, which reduced the number of engine crew required from 350 to 60.|$|R

Design problems requiring {{the inclusion of a}} realistic configuration of the vortex sheet are numerous.

40|$|The {{high speed}} vessels are {{primarily}} designed for short distances services as public transport of passengers and vehicles. The range of high speed, {{according to the}} Code of high-speed vessels begins at 20 knots, which depends on the cruise speed you desire for your vessel; {{you will have to}} use the most appropriate type of propellant. In general, in the past 20 years, they have been building high-speed vessels with speeds above 33 knots, which meant installing water jet propellants coupled to powerful engines and therefore of high consumption of fuel, increasing operating costs and causing increased air pollution. Although the prices of fuel have been reduced to half, due to the sharp fall in oil prices, the consumption of fuel and the air pollution remains high at these speeds and powers used, in addition to that the reduction of the time spent on each trip is not excessive, mainly in short routes that are less than an hour. This article is about adapting a ship of high-speed service, with a maximum speed in tests of 34 knots and to reduce its operating costs (fuel, maintenance, etc.) and make it economically viable; before the transformation, this vessel was operating with a service speed of 22 knots, and with a consumption per mile of 135 litters of MGO. The transformation process has consisted by: – Replacement of the two original water jet with four shaft lines with fix pitch propeller. – Replacement of the two original main engines (2 x 6500 kW = 13000 kW) by four engines (4 x 1380 kW = 5. 520 kW). – Changing the underwater hull shape to fit the new propellers and maximize its efficiency. – Relocation of auxiliary engines, to achieve the most efficient trim. – Installation of two <b>lateral</b> <b>propellers</b> to improve maneuverability and shorten the total time of journey. After the reform and the return to service of the vessel with a service speed of over 22 knots, it has been verified that the consumption per mile is of 45 litters MGO, representing a reduction of 65 % of consumption and even more reduction of emissions as the new engines comply with the latest regulations.

50|$|The Antoinette IV was {{an early}} French monoplane. It was a high-wing {{aircraft}} with a fuselage of extremely narrow triangular cross-section and a cruciform tail. Power was provided by a V8 engine of Léon Levavasseur's own design driving a paddle-bladed tractor <b>propeller.</b> <b>Lateral</b> control was at first effected with large triangular, and shortly afterwards trapezoidal-planform ailerons hinged to {{the trailing edge of}} the wings, although wing-warping was substituted at an early stage in flight trials, and in this type proved more effective. On 19 February 1909, the Antoinette IV flew 5 km at Mourmelon-le-Grand, and on 19 July, Hubert Latham attempted to cross the English Channel in it, covering 11 km out of Sangatte before making a forced water landing due to engine failure.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The present work {{is devoted}} to the {{analysis}} of the G-quadruplex DNA structure using the bioinfor-matics method. The interest towards quadruplex DNAs is determined by their involvement in the functioning of telomeres and onco-promoters {{as well as by the}} possibility to create on their basis aptamers and nanostructures. Here, we present an algorithm for a general analysis of the polymorphism of the G-quadruplex structure from the data bank PDB using original parameters. 74 structures were grouped according to the following param-eters: the number of DNA strands, the number of G-quartets, and the location and orientation of the connecting loops. Two quantitative parameters were used to describe the quadruplex structure: the twist angle between two adjacent quartets (analogous to that for the complementary pair in the duplex DNA) and the quartet planarity (an original parameter). The distribution patterns of these values are specific for each group of quadruplex struc-tures and are dependent upon the type of connecting loops used (diagonal, <b>lateral</b> or <b>propeller).</b> The tetramo-lecular loopless parallel quadruplex was used as a comparison template. The lateral loops introduce the strongest distortion into the structure of quadruplexes: the values of the twist angles are the lowest and are not typical for the other quadruplex groups. The loops of the diagonal type introduce much weaker deformation into quadru-plexes; the structures with propeller loops are characterized by the optimum geometry of G-quartets. Hence, the correlation between the twist angle and the tension in the structure of quadruplex DNA is revealed...|$|R
40|$|Applications of ship-to-ship {{operations}} for liquid cargo transfer, in particular for crude oil and LNG, will to be increasing in the future. Moreover, such operations {{are expected to}} take place in more severe environmental conditions. In order to {{have a better understanding of}} the hydrodynamic phenomena that are of importance for this kind of manoeuvres, a research project entitled “Investigating hydrodynamic aspects and control strategies for ship-to-ship operations” has been initiated, co-ordinated by MARINTEK (Trondheim, Norway) and supported financially by the Research Council of Norway. The main objective is to improve existing simulator based training activities for personnel involved in complex ship-to-ship operations in open seas through increased knowledge and understanding of the complex water flow between two ships operating in close proximity. As a final goal, a new generation simulation tools for ship-to-ship operations incorporating up-to-date knowledge of fluid dynamics has to be established. The project consists of four work packages: (1) Computational Fluid Dynamics; (2) Particle Image Velocimetry; (3) Mathematical models for simulators; (4) Nautical safety and control aspects. In the frame of the third work package, captive model tests are being carried out at the Towing tank for manoeuvres in shallow water (co-operation Flanders Hydraulics Research – Ghent University) in Antwerp, Belgium. While the model of an Aframax tanker is attached to the computer controlled planar motion carriage, a VLCC model is attached to the towing carriage as well. Two types of tests are considered: steady state tests, during which the main tests parameters (ships’ speed, relative longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> position, <b>propeller</b> rates, drift angle of the Aframax tanker, rudder angle) are kept constant, and dynamic tests, characterised by a varying lateral distance and/or heading. Horizontal forces and moments, propeller thrust and torque, and vertical motions are measured on both ship models, while the vertical motions of the free surface are monitored in three fixed points of the towing tank. The paper intends to give a summary of the test results, that will be used for validation of mathematical manoeuvring simulation models and CFD calculations...|$|R
