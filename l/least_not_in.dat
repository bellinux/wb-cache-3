5|$|A {{number of}} chronicles that mention Breton's death {{also note that}} he was the author of a legal {{treatise}} entitled le Bretoun, but this cannot be the surviving work called Britton, at <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the current form, as that work discusses laws composed 15 years after Breton's death. It is unclear why he was credited with the work, and whether this attribution is just a confusion of Breton with the real author or if he did in fact author the work, which was later revised. The fact that the Britton is written in French, not Latin, and that it contains little information about the theory of law, being mostly concerned with the practical application of laws, points rather strongly to an author who was a royal justice, which Breton was.|$|E
5|$|Pairs did not {{cooperate}} in feeding, at <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> a strict sense. All such reports {{are based on}} misunderstanding of an account by ornithologist Walter Buller of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood-boring beetle larvae. According to this misunderstanding, which {{has become part of}} ecological folklore, the male would tear at the wood and open larval tunnels, thus allowing the female to probe deeply into the tunnels with her long, pliant bill. Rather, the divergent bills represent an extreme example of niche differentiation, reducing intraspecific competition between the sexes. This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats.|$|E

25|$|Modern mayflies have {{eliminated}} all the instars between imago and nymph, except the single instar called subimago, {{which is still}} not (at <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the males) fully sexually mature. The other flying insects with incomplete metamorphosis (Exopterygota) have gone a little further and completed the trend; here all the immature structures of the animal from the last nymphal stage are completed at once in a single final moult. The more advanced insects with larvae and complete metamorphosis (Endopterygota) have gone even further. An interesting theory {{here is that the}} pupal stage is actually a strongly modified and extended stage of subimago, but so far it {{is nothing more than a}} theory. Interestingly enough there are some insects within the Exopterygota, thrips and whiteflies (Aleyrodidae), who have evolved pupae-like stages too.|$|E

25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, {{historian}} Norman Cantor, in In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World It Made (2001), suggests the Black Death {{might have been}} a combination of pandemics including a form of anthrax, a cattle murrain. He cites many forms of evidence including: reported disease symptoms not in keeping with the known effects of either bubonic or pneumonic plague, the discovery of anthrax spores in a plague pit in Scotland, and the fact that meat from infected cattle was known to have been sold in many rural English areas prior to the onset of the plague. The means of infection varied widely, with infection in the absence of living or recently dead humans in Sicily (which speaks against most viruses). Also, diseases with similar symptoms were generally not distinguished between in that period (see murrain above), at <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the Christian world; Chinese and Muslim medical records can be expected to yield better information which however only pertains to the specific disease(s) which affected these areas.|$|E

Hearing of Shihei's treachery, Kan Shōjō becomes enraged, breaking off a branch from the plum tree and striking off Heima's head with it, {{as if it were}} a sword. He asks Shiradayū and Umeōmaru to hurry to the capital, to warn the emperor of Shihei's plans. Knowing that he cannot return to the capital himself, at <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> body, having been formally exiled, he vows to return as an angry spirit. To that end, he vows to journey to the summit of Mount Tenpai, where he will engage in austere disciplines, swear oaths to the gods, and become a ghostly lord of thunders. As he speaks, a storm rises up. His retainers grasp at his sleeves and try to stop him, but he throws them off, and flies off into the sky, already beginning to transform into a thunder spirit.|$|E

500|$|Background vocals on [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] and [...] "Your Star" [...] were {{performed}} by The Millennium Choir, which {{worked with the}} band on several songs on Fallen. Richard Harrington of The Washington Post said the album consists of gothic rock songs with brooding lyrics and Lee's vocals accompanied by pianos, strings and choirs. Other genres present on the album are heavy metal, opera and pop music. Jim Farber of Daily News explained, [...] "Evanescence's music again isn't quite metal (unless you think Creed qualifies). Neither is it exactly pop (at <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the current R sense of the term). But the resulting hybrid offers a genuine alternative to everything else that's out there." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{failure of}} the Cray-3 was in large {{part due to the}} {{changing}} political and technical climate. The machine was being designed during the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and ending of the cold war, which led to a massive downsizing in supercomputer purchases. At the same time, the market was increasingly investing in massively parallel (MP or MPP) designs. Cray was critical of this approach, and was quoted by the Wall Street Journal as saying that MPP systems had not yet proven their supremacy over vector computers, noting the difficulty many users have had programming for large parallel machines.

500|$|Although {{there is}} no {{documentary}} evidence confirming the architects, all sources attribute most of Regency Square's buildings to the father-and-son partnership of Amon and Amon Henry Wilds, who moved to Brighton from nearby Lewes in 1815 and became two of Brighton's most important architects; they were extremely prolific, and were responsible for defining and developing the town's distinctive Regency style. [...] Although they worked extensively with fellow architect Charles Busby during the 1820s, historians agree {{that he was not}} involved in the overall design of Regency Square, at <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> its early stages: the buildings [...] "appear to lack his distinctive flair" [...] and are not as impressive as those at the Kemp Town estate to the east of Brighton, which all three men were involved with.

500|$|Mainly {{located in}} places such as the Mongol capital of Karakorum, European missionaries and merchants {{traveled}} around the Mongol realm during a period of time referred to by historians as the [...] "Pax Mongolica". The most famous European visitor to China during this period was Marco Polo, preceded, respectively, by his father and uncle Niccolò and Maffeo Polo. Perhaps the most important political consequence of this movement of peoples and intensified trade was the Franco-Mongol alliance, although the latter never fully materialized, at <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> a consistent manner. The establishment of the Ming dynasty in 1368 and reestablishment of native Han Chinese rule led to the cessation of European merchants and Roman Catholic missionaries living in China. Direct contact with Europeans was not renewed until Portuguese explorers and Jesuit missionaries arrived on Ming China's southern shores {{at the beginning of the}} 16th century, during the Age of Exploration.|$|E
500|$|D'Angelo and {{his crew}} also {{utilized}} a hip hop production style, which often subordinates song structure to a stable foundation for a rapper's delivery and flow. This was familiar to D'Angelo, as his first original recordings were rap demos. Subsequently, most of the songs were performed without a definitive structure, settling into a mid-tempo groove with minimal verse-chorus-bridge progression. This also resulted in an emphasis on texture over both structure and hooks. New York writer Ethan Smith noted this occurrence, stating [...] "most of the songs aren't really songs at all -- at <b>least,</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the traditional sense". While not predominant on the album, some tracks incorporate sampling. Most of its production was influenced by hip hop producer J Dilla's input. On J Dilla's influence, Questlove stated [...] "He's the zenith of hip-hop to us. Jay Dee helped {{to bring out the}} album's dirty sound and encouraged the false starts and the nonquantized sound of the record".|$|E

[...] The album ends with [...] "Nature Feels", a reinterpretation of MGMT's [...] "Electric Feel".
