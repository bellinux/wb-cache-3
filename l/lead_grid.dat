[...] In 1859, Gaston Planté's lead-acid battery was the first battery that could be recharged by passing a reverse current through it. Planté's first model consisted of two lead sheets separated by rubber strips and rolled into a spiral. His batteries were first used to power the lights in train carriages while stopped at a station.

5000|$|In 1880, Camille Alphonse Faure {{patented}} {{a method}} of coating a <b>lead</b> <b>grid</b> (which serves as the current conductor) with a paste of lead oxides, sulfuric acid and water, followed by curing phase in which the plates were exposed to gentle heat in a high humidity environment. The curing process caused the paste to change to a mixture of lead sulfates which adhered to the lead plate. Then, during the battery's initial charge (called [...] "formation") the cured paste on the plates was converted into electrochemically active material (the [...] "active mass"). Faure's process significantly reduced the time and cost to manufacture lead-acid batteries, and gave {{a substantial increase in}} capacity compared with Planté's battery. Faure's method is still in use today, with only incremental improvements to paste composition, curing (which is still done with steam, but is now a very tightly controlled process), and structure and composition of the grid to which the paste is applied.|$|E

40|$|Concurrent linear sweep voltammetry, coulometry, and {{electrochemical}} {{quartz crystal}} microgravimetry (EQCM) were used, we believe {{for the first}} time, to study anodic corrosion layers at lead. These corrosion layers were first generated on the lead surface at 0. 8 V (vs. Ag/AgCI/satd. KCI reference) either in 4. 5 M H 2 SO 4 or 0. 1 M Na 2 SO 4. A subsequent cathodic voltammetry scan revealed waves due to {{the reduction of the}} corrosion layer. Coulometry and EQCM analyses were then performed within the potential window corresponding to each cathodic wave. From these charge and mass measurements respectively, an n/AM parameter (n = electron stoichiometry, AM = molar mass difference between solid products and reactants) could be extracted and compared with the value computed for a model reaction candidate. We thus show that basic lead sulfates can be detected in the presence of both PbO and PbSO 4. Thus PbO 9 PbSO 4 is shown to be a corrosion product in 4. 5 M H 2 SO 4 while 3 PbO 9 PbSO 4 9 H 20 is generated at the lead surface in 0. 1 M Na 2 SO 4. The corrosion of the <b>lead</b> <b>grid</b> at the positive electrode is a key factor in the failure of lead acid batteries. Thus it is perhaps not surprising that the anodic corrosion of lead has been the topic of many studies (cf. Ref. 1 for a review).

30|$|For a {{sustainable}} and secure future electrical energy provision, {{it is inevitable}} to significantly increase the share of generation from renewable sources in the energy system. Compared to the traditional generation from fossil resources, the energy density of renewable energy sources is low. The number of generation units is comparably high, {{but they have a}} rather low individual power output compared to large centralised power plants. The integration of such distributed generators into the existing power <b>grids</b> <b>leads</b> to a number of different issues [4]. One of these issues is the fact that a strong growth of electricity generation in the medium-voltage grid, where most of the installed distributed generation injects its power, <b>leads</b> to <b>grid</b> voltage problems [5]. At the feed-in points, the grid voltages reach the given limits in times of low demand, so that no more units can be installed without significant grid investments [6, 7]. Here, online voltage control in the medium-voltage feeders (basing on measurement data from critical grid nodes) by controlling grid components such as tab changer transformers and generation units, the so-called active grid operation [8], can solve the problem of keeping the grid voltage in the defined limits. Instead of investing into new power lines, the problem is tackled by installing comparably inexpensive communication systems and controllers [9].|$|R

40|$|Many popular {{groundwater}} modeling {{codes are}} based on the finite-differences or finite-volume method for orthogonal grids. In cases of complex subsurface geometries this type of <b>grid</b> <b>leads</b> either to coarse geometric representations or to extreme large meshes. We use a coordinate transformation method (CTM) to circumvent this shortcoming. In computational fluid dynamics (CFD), this method has been successfully applied to the general Navier-Stokes equation. The method is based on tensor analysis and performs a transformation of a curvilinear into a rectangular unit grid, on which a modified formulation of the differential equations is applied. Therefore {{it is not necessary to}} reformulate the code in total.

40|$|As the world's power needs grow, {{the demand}} for power from {{renewable}} resources, such as wind or solar is increasing.
