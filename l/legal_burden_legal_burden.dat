40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} {{allocation}} of the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> of proof in cases concerning the application of Article 101 TFEU, as prescribed by Article 2 of Regulation 1 / 2003 which provides that the Commission is responsible for establishing that an agreement or concerted practice constitutes a restriction of competition by object or effect, whereas {{it is for the}} undertakings to demonstrate the ‘defence’ of Article 101 (3) TFEU. The article investigates how this shared division of the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> instructs competition analysis under Article 101 TFEU and affects its enforcement; and secondly, whether such a bifurcated apportionment of the burden of persuasion respects the evidential prescriptions of the presumption of innocence. The analysis of these two questions yields the conclusion that shifting the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> of establishing the conditions of Article 101 (3) TFEU on the undertakings is prone to distort the substantive scope of Article 101 TFEU and increase the risk of over-enforcement, whilst it is also at odds with the presumption of innocence. On this basis, it is submitted that Article 2 of Regulation 1 / 2003 must be re-read as placing the whole <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> on the Commission and imposing only an evidential burden on defendant undertakings...|$|R
2500|$|However, in England and Wales, the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, s.101 {{stipulates}} that where a defendant relies on some [...] "exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification" [...] in his defence, the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> of proof as to that exception {{falls on the}} defendant, though only on the balance of probabilities. For example, a person charged with being drunk {{in charge of a}} motor vehicle can raise the defence that there was no likelihood of his driving while drunk. The prosecution has the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> of proof beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant exceeded the legal limit of alcohol and was in control of a motor vehicle. Possession of the keys is usually sufficient to prove control, even if the defendant is not in the vehicle and is perhaps in a nearby bar. That being proved, the defendant has the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> of proof on the balance of probabilities that he was not likely to drive.|$|R
5000|$|Arriving Aliens: As {{a general}} rule, the Arriving Alien bears the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> of proof of clear {{admissibility}} to the United States. However, {{in the case}} of Arriving Aliens who have previously been granted Lawful Permanent Resident status, there is a presumpion in favor of granting them entry, with the exceptions being those aliens who satisfy {{one or more of the}} grounds of inadmissibility covered in INA Section 212. There is some legal ambiguity regarding who has the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> of proof here, but some legal scholars have held that the burden of proof falls on the prosecution {{in the case of}} LPRs.|$|R

50|$|Having {{regard to}} the {{importance}} of the right to be presumed innocent in the South African criminal justice system {{and the fact that the}} State could have achieved its objective by less intrusive means, the imposition of the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> upon an accused had a disproportional impact on the right in question. In these circumstances, the court held, the risk of convicting an innocent person was too high, and outweighed the other considerations in favour of the limitation. There were no compelling societal reasons in this particular case that would justify imposing this <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> on the accused. Therefore, the court held that the limitation was not justified.|$|R
5000|$|The {{satisfaction}} of the evidential burden has sometimes been described as [...] "shifting the burden of proof", a label which has been criticized because the burden placed on a defendant is not the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> of proof resting on the prosecution.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the reverse <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> of proof upheld by the House of Lords in Sheldrake v The Director of Public Prosecutions [2004] UKHL 43 {{in relation to the}} offence ‘being drunk in charge’ of a motor vehicle, contrary to the Road Traffic Act 1988 s. 5 (1) (b), and the defence under s 5 (2). It considers two main arguments that arose from Sheldrake. First, that the section 5 (2) defence that there was no likelihood of the defendant driving while over the limit forms part of the gravamen of the section 5 (1) (b) offence and that, accordingly, a reverse <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> amounts to a breach of the presumption of innocence. It is argued that this analysis, approved by the Divisional Court but largely overlooked by the House of Lords, is per Lord Bingham “too simple and only partially correct”. Secondly, it will be considered whether some offences, such as ‘being drunk in charge’, may be classified as regulatory on the basis that the offence was concerned with a lawful activity that the defendant voluntarily engaged in that presented a serious risk or danger to public health and safety. It is argued that in this context a reverse <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> may normally be presumed...|$|R
50|$|Also, it {{has been}} said that because {{hospitals}} have had more <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> placed on them in recent decades, they have more of an incentive to require their physicians to be competent. State medical boards have increased the number of disciplinary actions against physicians since the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The court held, having {{regard to}} the {{importance}} of dealing effectively with conduct that hampers the administration of justice, that the incursion into the right to silence was justifiable. The same could not be said, however, of the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> which required a conviction despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.|$|R
50|$|The {{courts have}} found such {{scrutiny}} {{necessary for a}} number of reasons. Rationally, imposing <b>legal</b> <b>burdens</b> on an illegitimate person in order to express disapproval of the conduct of her parents is illogical, unjust, and contrary to the fundamental principle that <b>legal</b> <b>burdens</b> should have some relationship to individual wrongdoing. Like race or gender, the court has stressed that an illegitimate person's status of birth is a condition over which she has no control, and it has no bearing on her ability or willingness to contribute to society. In applying increasingly exacting intermediate scrutiny, the courts have noted that illegitimate persons are a stigmatized minority, are vastly outnumbered politically, and are the target of long-standing and continuing invidious legal discrimination. For all these reasons, exacting constitutional scrutiny is mandated under the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|R
50|$|If sex work is {{accepted}} as unethical, there is then {{the dispute over}} which parties of the contract {{are responsible for the}} ethical or legal breach. Traditionally, in many societies, the <b>legal</b> and ethical <b>burden</b> of guilt has been placed largely on the sex worker rather than consumers. In recent decades, in some countries, such as Sweden, Norway and Iceland, the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> of prostitution has been moved solely to the consumer.|$|R
5000|$|An {{evidential burden}} compels {{a party to}} produce {{evidence}} in support of an issue it seeks to raise, failing which the party shall not be permitted to raise it at all. This burden can rest on either party, although it usually relates to matters of defence raised by the accused. Some defences impose an evidential burden on the defendant. If the evidential burden is met, the prosecution then bears the burden of proof (which is not called an evidential burden). For example, if a person charged with murder pleads self-defence, the defendant must satisfy the evidential burden that there are some evidence suggesting self-defence. The burden of proof then falls on the prosecution to produce evidence to support their position. In such a case, a <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> will always rest on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was not acting in self-defence. A <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> is determined by substantive law, rests upon one party and never shifts.|$|R
5000|$|Legislation {{solves the}} {{problems}} of liability and responsibilities of cost. Once the conditions for providing assistance to a requesting state have been set, the terms constitute a legally binding contractual agreement that makes affected states responsible for reimbursement. Responding states can rest assured that sending aid {{will not be a}} financial or <b>legal</b> <b>burden,</b> and personnel who are deployed are protected under workers compensation and liability provisions.|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the success of}} the two distinct construction industry payment legislative models operating in Australia – “East Coast” and “West Coast” – in achieving their objective of improving cash flow throughout the construction industry. Success parameters are identified by the authors – namely: the levels of justice afforded by the legislation, the administrative and <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> generated by the legislation, and the impact of the legislation on the relationships between the contracting parties – which are used as a basis to discuss and compare the performances of the East and West Coast models. It is concluded that the West Coast model provides a more just dispute resolution process, generates less administrative and <b>legal</b> <b>burden,</b> and is more conducive towards establishing positive relationships between contracting parties. However, it is recognised {{that there is a need}} for more data to be gathered from construction industry stakeholders before any firm recommendations can start to be made as to the most appropriate conceptual framework and detail for a harmonised approach...|$|R
500|$|Although fair {{criticism}} {{has been treated}} as a defence to scandalizing the court in some cases, the Court of Appeal preferred to view it as an element of liability, though it cautioned that [...] "the precise characterisation {{of the concept of}} fair criticism was not fully canvassed before us ... Accordingly, our views on this point must necessarily be taken, to that extent, to be provisional in nature." [...] The Court said that adopting this approach ensures that an alleged contemnor is not disadvantaged with regard to the burden of proof: [...] "If the concept of fair criticism relates to liability, then the evidential burden would be on the party relying on it. The <b>legal</b> <b>burden,</b> on the other hand, would be on the Respondent to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the impugned statement does not constitute fair criticism, and that it presents a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice. If, however, the concept of fair criticism constitutes a defence, then the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> would shift to the alleged contemnor to show on the balance of probabilities that the impugned statement amounts to fair criticism." ...|$|R

50|$|Republican republicanism {{is thus a}} {{political}} philosophy tending to increase the scope of activities entrusted to the State, by setting up a planned economy with a powerful public sector and a gradual socialization of property; in the meanwhile private ownership has to be fraught with <b>legal</b> <b>burdens</b> for the common good. This doctrine borrows a number of ideas from {{the traditions of the}} British Fabian Society, French solidarism and German chair-socialism as well as the Spanish school of Krausist philosophers and lawyers who inspired the II Republic (1931-1939), whose Constitution he takes as a paradigm.|$|R

50|$|In many states, {{presumption}} of innocence is a legal right of the accused in a criminal trial, {{and it is an}} international human right under the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 11. Under the {{presumption of}} innocence, the <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> of proof is thus on the prosecution, which must collect and present compelling evidence to the trier of fact. The trier of fact (a judge or a jury) is thus restrained and ordered by law to consider only actual evidence and testimony presented in court. The prosecution must, in most cases prove that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt. If reasonable doubt remains, the accused must be acquitted.|$|R

5000|$|Double hearsay is a hearsay {{statement}} that contains another {{hearsay statement}} itself. For example, a witness wants to testify that [...] "a very reliable man {{informed me that}} Wools-Sampson told him". The statements of the very reliable man and Wools-Sampson are both hearsay submissions {{on the part of}} the witness, and the second hearsay (the statement of Wools-Sampson) depends on the first (the statement of the very reliable man). In a court, both layers of hearsay must be found separately admissible. In this example, the first hearsay also comes from an anonymous source, and the admissibility of an anonymous statement depends upon the discharge of an additional <b>legal</b> <b>burden</b> of proof.|$|R
