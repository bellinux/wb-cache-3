We find that extinction corrected Halpha underestimates the SFR, and the degree of this underestimation increases with the infrared luminosity of the galaxies. Galaxies with very different levels of dust extinction as measured with SFR(IR) /SFR(Halpha, uncorrected for extinction) present a similar attenuation A[Halpha], as if the Balmer lines probed a different region of the galaxy than the one responsible for the bulk of the IR luminosity for large SFRs. In addition, SFR estimates derived from [OII] 3727 match very well those inferred from Halpha after applying the metallicity correction derived from local galaxies. SFRs estimated from the UV luminosities show a dichotomic behavior, similar to that previously reported by other authors in galaxies at z <~ 0. 4. Here we extend this result up to z ~ 0. 8. Finally, one of the studied objects is a <b>luminous</b> <b>compact</b> <b>galaxy</b> (LCG) that may be suffering similar dust-enshrouded star formation episodes.

40|$|<b>Luminous</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Galaxies</b> are enigmatic sources by many aspects. They {{can reach}} the {{luminosity}} of the Milky Way within a radius {{of only a few}} kpc. They also represent one of the most rapidly evolving populations of galaxies since they represent up to 1 / 5 of the luminous galaxies at redshift z= 0. 7 while being almost absent in the local Universe. The measurement of their dynamics is crucial to our understanding of LCGs since this has the potential of telling us which physical process(es) that drives them, and ultimately to link them to the existing present-day galaxies. Here we derive the 3 dimensional velocity fields and velocity dispersion (sigma) maps of 17 <b>Luminous</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Galaxies</b> selected from the Canada France Redshift Survey and the Hubble Deep Field South with redshifts ranging from z= 0. 4 to z= 0. 75. We find that only 18 % of them show rotational velocity fields typical of rotating disks, the others showing more complex kinematics. Assuming that LCGs are not too far from equilibrium, about half of LCGs then appear to be either non-relaxed objects, or objects that are not supported by velocity dispersion alone. This supports the view that an important fraction of LCGs are probably mergers. It brings additional support to the ``spiral rebuilding scenario'' in which LCGs correspond to a previous or post-merger phase before the disk re-building. Comment: (1) GEPI, Obs.

Galaxies in this sample have a compact structure and include one or several regions of active star formation. Global galaxy characteristics (metallicity, luminosity, stellar mass) are intermediate between ones of the nearby blue <b>compact</b> dwarf (BCD) <b>galaxies</b> and Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at high redshifts z > 2 - 3. SFRs were corrected for interstellar extinction which was derived from the optical Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra.

Simple regression relations are found for luminosities L(Hα) and L(UV) as functions of the mass of the young stellar population, the starburst age, and the galaxy metallicity. We consider the evolution of L(Hα), L(FUV) and L(NUV) with a starburst age and introduce new characteristics of star formation, namely the initial Hα, FUV and NUV luminosities at zero starburst age.

They are rare at the current cosmic epoch, but were more abundant in the past and may be seen as the local analogues of higher red shift Lyman break galaxies. Studies of their kinematics is key to understanding what triggers their unusually active star formation. In this work, we investigate the kinematics of stars and ionised gas in Haro 11, one of the most <b>luminous</b> blue <b>compact</b> <b>galaxies</b> in the local Universe. Previous works have indicated that many of these galaxies may be triggered by galaxy mergers. We have employed Fabry-Perot interferometry, long-slit spectroscopy, and integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy to explore the kinematics of Haro 11. We target the near-infrared calcium triplet, and use cross-correlation and penalised pixel fitting techniques to derive the stellar velocity field and velocity dispersion. We analyse ionised gas through emission lines from hydrogen, [O III], and [S III]. When spectral resolution and signal to noise allows, we investigate the line profile in detail and identify multiple velocity components when present. The spectra reveal a complex velocity field whose components, both stellar and gaseous, we attempt to disentangle. We find that to first order, the velocity field and velocity dispersions derived from stars and ionised gas agree. Hence the complexities reveal real dynamical disturbances providing further evidence for a merger in Haro 11. Through decomposition of emission lines, we find evidence for kinematically distinct components, for instance, a tidal arm. The ionised gas velocity field can be traced to large galactocentric radii, and shows significant velocity dispersion even far out in the halo. If interpreted as virial motions, this indicates that Haro 11 may have a mass of similar to 10 (11) M-circle dot.

40|$|To make direct {{comparisons}} in the rest-far-ultraviolet between LBGs at z~ 3 {{and more}} local star-forming galaxies, we use HST/STIS to image {{a set of}} 12 nearby (z< 0. 05) HII galaxies in the FUV {{and a set of}} 14 <b>luminous</b> <b>compact</b> blue <b>galaxies</b> (LCBGs) at moderate redshift (z~ 0. 5) in the NUV, corresponding to the rest-FUV. We then subject both sets of galaxy images and those of LBGs at z~ 3 to the same morphological and structural analysis. We find many qualitative and quantitative similarities between the rest-FUV characteristics of distant LBGs and of the more nearby starburst samples, including general morphologies, sizes, asymmetries, and concentrations. Along with some kinematic similarities, this implies that nearby HII galaxies and LCBGs may be reasonable local analogs of distant Lyman break galaxies. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|Most galaxies follow {{well-defined}} scaling {{relations of}} metallicity (O/H), star formation rate (SFR), and stellar mass. However, low-metallicity starbursts, {{rare in the}} Local Universe but more common at high redshift, deviate significantly from these scaling relations. On the "main sequence" of star formation, these galaxies have high SFR for a given M*; and on the mass-metallicity relation, they have excess M* for their low metallicity. In this paper, we characterize O/H, M*, and SFR for these deviant "low-metallicity starbursts", selected from a sample of ~ 1100 galaxies, spanning almost two orders of magnitude in metal abundance, a factor of ~ 10 ^ 6 in SFR, and of ~ 10 ^ 5 in stellar mass. Our sample includes quiescent star-forming <b>galaxies</b> and blue <b>compact</b> dwarfs at redshift 0, <b>luminous</b> <b>compact</b> <b>galaxies</b> at redshift 0. 3, and Lyman Break galaxies at redshifts 1 - 3. 4. Applying a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the galaxies in our sample with M*< 10 ^{ 10 } Msun gives a Fundamental Plane (FP) of scaling relations; SFR and stellar mass define the plane itself, and O/H its thickness. The dispersion for our sample in the edge-on view of the plane is 0. 17 dex, independently of redshift and including the metal-poor starbursts. The same FP is followed by 55100 galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, with a dispersion of 0. 06 dex. In a companion paper, we develop multi-phase chemical evolution models that successfully predict the observed scaling relations and the FP; the deviations from the main scaling relations are caused by a different (starburst or "active") mode of star formation. These scaling relations do not truly evolve, but rather are defined by the different galaxy populations dominant at different cosmological epochs.

40|$|Context. <b>Luminous</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Galaxies</b> (LCGs) (MB≤− 20, R 1 / 2 ≤ 4. 5 kpc and EW 0 (OII) ≥ 15 Å) {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} rapidly evolving galaxy populations over the last∼ 8 Gyr history of the universe. Due to their inherently compact sizes, any detailed quantitative analysis of their morphologies has proved to be difficult in the past. Hence, the morphologies and thereby the local counterparts of these enigmatic sources have been hotly debated. Aims. Our aim is to use the high angular resolution, deep, multiband HST/ACS imaging data, from the HST/ACS GOODS survey, to study the quantitative morphology of a complete sample of LCGs in the redshift range 0. 5 ≤z≤ 1. 2. Methods. We have derived structural parameters for a representative sample of 39 LCGs selected from the GOODS-S HST/ACS field, using full 2 -dimensional surface brightness profile fitting of the galaxy images {{in each of the four}} filters available. B 435 W − z 850 LP color maps are constructed for the sample to aid in the morphological classification. We then use the rest frame B band bulge flux fraction (B/T) to determine the morphological class of galaxies which are well fit by a bulge+disk two dimensional structure. Mergers were essentially identified visually by the presence of multiple maxima of comparable intensity in the rest frame B band images, aided by the color maps to distinguish them from HII regions. We also make use of the Spitzer 24 µm source catalog of sources in the CDFS to derive the dust enshrouded star formation rates (SFR) for some of the sample LCGs Results. We derive the following morphological mix for our sample of intermediate redshift LCGs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} results of far {{infrared}} (FIR) spectroscopy of the <b>luminous</b> blue <b>compact</b> <b>galaxy</b> (BCG) Haro 11 (ESO 350 -IG 38) obtained with the Long Wavelength Spectrometer (LWS) on the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) in low resolution mode. This metal poor dwarf merger is an extremely hot IRAS source. We discuss the balance between dust and line cooling in the photodissociated regions (PDR), in particular {{the role of the}} [CII]λ 158 µ line, and derive the basic properties of the PDR gas and estimates of the gas and dust masses. The mass of the PDRs, 2 + 2 − 1 108 M⊙, is comparable to that of the ionized gas and exceeds the observed upper limit of the HI mass. The gas/dust mass ratio is low, indicating that the galaxy contains little cold dust. The low metallicity, the intense radiation field and the low column density of Haro 11 results in an extremely hig...|$|R
