2500|$|The direct liquid {{introduction}} (DLI) interface {{was developed}} in 1980. This interface was thought {{as a solution to}} the evaporation of liquid inside the capillary inlet interface. In DLI, a nebulizer was used to disintegrate part of the effluent coming from the column. A small diaphragm was used to form a <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> composed of small droplets that were subsequently dried in a desolvation chamber. A microbore capillary column was used to transfer the nebulized liquid product to the MS ion source. The analytes were ionized using a solvent assisted chemical ionization source, where the LC solvents acted as reagent gases.To use this interface, it was necessary to split the flow coming out of the LC column because {{only a small portion of}} the effluent (10 to 50 μl/min out of 1 ml/min) could be [...] analyzed on-line without breaking the MS vacuum. One of the main operational problems of the DLI interface was the frequent clogging of the diaphragm orifices. The DLI interface was used between 1982 and 1985 for the analysis of pesticides, corticosteroids, metabolites in equine urine, erythromycin, and vitamin B12. However, this interface was replaced by the thermospray interface, which removed the flow rate limitations and the issues with the clogging diaphragms.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} experimental {{results on the}} breakup behavior of <b>liquid</b> <b>jets</b> emanating from elliptical orifices with different orifice aspect ratios. The experiments were {{carried out in the}} range of mean jet velocity 0 − 5 m/s, using water as the working fluid; the <b>liquid</b> <b>jets</b> were injected vertically downward in still, ambient air. Photographic methods were employed to analyze the breakup characteristics of the <b>liquid</b> <b>jets.</b> The breakup curves of the elliptical orifice jets are compared with those of circular orifices with the same exit area as the elliptical orifices. The comparison shows that the <b>liquid</b> <b>jets</b> emanating from the elliptical orifice are less stable than jets from the circular orifice in a particular range of flow conditions corresponding to a √We range of 2 − 20. We attribute this enhanced instability of the elliptical jet to the axis-switching process occurring in this √We regime, a phenomenon by which the elliptical jet interchanges major and minor axes periodically as the jet flows downstream. The breakup process of the elliptical jet resembles that of the circular jet below this range of flow conditions, and their breakup curves coincide. Above this range, the elliptical <b>liquid</b> <b>jets</b> exhibit different flow behavior from the circular jet, although their breakup curves coincide again...|$|R

50|$|Combustion instabilities are {{typically}} violent pressure oscillations in a combustion chamber. These pressure oscillations {{can be as}} high as 180 dB, and long term exposure to these cyclic pressure and thermal loads reduces the life of engine components. In rockets, such as the F1 used in the Saturn V program, instabilities led to massive damage of the combustion chamber and surrounding components. This problem was solved by re-designing the fuel injector. In <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> engines the droplet size and distribution can be used to attenuate the instabilities. Combustion instabilities are a major concern in ground-based gas turbine engines because of NOx emissions. The tendency is to run lean, an equivalence ratio less than 1, to reduce the combustion temperature and thus reduce the NOx emissions; however, running the combustion lean makes it very susceptible to combustion instability.|$|E
50|$|As an {{air bubble}} rises, {{there is a}} {{difference}} in pressure between {{the top and bottom of}} the bubble. The higher pressure at the bottom of the bubble pushes the bubble's bottom surface up faster than the top surface rises. This creates a fluid jet that moves up through the center of the bubble. If the fluid jet has enough energy, it will puncture the top of the bubble and create a bubble ring. Because of the motion of the fluid moving through the center of the bubble, the bubble begins to rotate. This rotation moves the fluid around the bubble creating a toroidal vortex. If the surface tension of the fluid interface or the viscosity of the liquid is too high, then the <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> will be more broad and will not penetrate the top of the bubble. This results in a spherical cap bubble. Air bubbles with a diameter greater than about two centimeters become toroidal in shape due to the pressure differences.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the primary breakup of nonturbulent round <b>liquid</b> <b>jets</b> in gas crossflow is described. Pulsed shadowgraph and holograph observations of jet primary breakup regimes, conditions for the onset of breakup, properties of waves observed along the liquid surface, drop sue and velocity properties resulting from breakup and conditions required for {{the breakup of the}} liquid column as a whole, were obtained for air crossflows at normal temperature and pressure. When combined with the earlier studies of Mazallon et al.

50|$|The {{role of the}} {{tangential}} viscous {{stress is}} essential in establishing a steady meniscus shape in flow focusing, as illustrated {{in the case of}} a simple <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> surrounded by a gas. In the absence of a sufficiently strong tangential stress, a round-apex meniscus is obtained. Both the inner liquid and the external gas flows would exhibit stagnation regions around the round apex. The surface tension stress σ/D would be simply balanced by an appropriate pressure jump across the interface. If one slowly pushes a liquid flow rate Q, the system would spit intermittently the excess of liquid to recover the round-apex equilibrium shape. However, when the tangential stress is sufficiently vigorous compared to σ /D, the surface can be deformed into a steady tapering shape, which allows the continuous and smooth acceleration of the liquid under the combined actions of the pressure drop ΔP and the tangential viscous stress τs on the liquid surface.|$|E
5000|$|Liquids are {{encapsulated}} using {{a rotating}} extrusion head containing concentric nozzles. In this process, a jet of core liquid {{is surrounded by}} a sheath of wall solution or melt. As the jet moves through the air it breaks, owing to Rayleigh instability, into droplets of core, each coated with the wall solution. While the droplets are in flight, the molten wall may be hardened or a solvent may be evaporated from the wall solution. Since most of the droplets are within ± 10% of the mean diameter, they land in a narrow ring around the spray nozzle. Hence, if needed, the capsules can be hardened after formation by catching them in a ring-shaped hardening bath. This process is excellent for forming particles [...] in diameter. Since the drops are formed by the breakup of a <b>liquid</b> <b>jet,</b> the process is only suitable for liquid or slurries. A high production can be achieved, up to 22.5 kg of microcapsules can be produced per nozzle per hour.|$|E
50|$|Simple {{atomization}} {{techniques are}} available in which liquid metal is forced through an orifice at a sufficiently high velocity to ensure turbulent flow. The usual performance index used is the Reynolds number R = fvd/n, where f = fluid density, v = velocity of the exit stream, d = diameter of the opening, and n = absolute viscosity. At low R the <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> oscillates, but at higher velocities the stream becomes turbulent and breaks into droplets. Pumping energy is applied to droplet formation with very low efficiency (on the order of 1%) and control over the size distribution of the metal particles produced is rather poor. Other techniques such as nozzle vibration, nozzle asymmetry, multiple impinging streams, or molten-metal injection into ambient gas are all available to increase atomization efficiency, produce finer grains, and to narrow the particle size distribution. Unfortunately, {{it is difficult to}} eject metals through orifices smaller than a few millimeters in diameter, which in practice limits the minimum size of powder grains to approximately 10 μm. Atomization also produces a wide spectrum of particle sizes, necessitating downstream classification by screening and remelting a significant fraction of the grain boundary.|$|E
