25|$|They have extra-long antennae, and {{may have}} long, slender legs and a passive demeanour. Although they have no hearing organs on their front <b>legs</b> <b>like</b> species of Hemideina and Deinacrida, some (e.g., Talitropsis spp.) are very {{sensitive}} to ground vibrations sensed through pads on their feet. Specialised hairs on the cerci and organs on the antennae are also sensitive to low-frequency vibrations in the air.|$|E
25|$|The {{chimney swift}} (Chaetura pelagica) is a bird {{belonging}} to the swift family Apodidae. A member of the genus Chaetura, it {{is closely related to}} both the Vaux's swift and the Chapman's swift; in the past, the three were sometimes considered to be conspecific. It has no subspecies. The chimney swift is a medium-sized, sooty gray bird with very long, slender wings and very short <b>legs.</b> <b>Like</b> all swifts, it is incapable of perching, and can only cling vertically to surfaces.|$|E

25|$|Most adult mites {{have four}} pairs of <b>legs,</b> <b>like</b> other arachnids, but some have fewer. For example, gall mites like Phyllocoptes variabilis (family Eriophyidae) have a {{worm-like}} body {{with only two}} pairs of legs; some parasitic mites have only one or three pairs of legs in the adult stage. Larval and prelarval stages have a maximum of three pairs of legs; adult mites with only three pairs of legs may be called 'larviform'. Also members of the Nematalycidae within Endeostigmata, which live between sand grains, have often wormlike and elongated bodies with reduced legs.|$|E
25|$|Anchiornis {{had very}} long legs, {{which is usually}} an {{indication}} that an animal is a strong runner. However, the extensive leg feathers indicate {{that this may be}} a vestigial trait, as running animals tend to have reduced, not increased, hair or feathers on their <b>legs.</b> <b>Like</b> most paravians, Anchiornis had four toes on the foot, with the third and fourth toes the longest. The first toe, or hallux, was not reversed as in perching species. The hindwings of Anchiornis were also shorter than those of Microraptor, and were made up of 12–13 flight feathers anchored to the tibia (lower leg) and 10–11 to the tarsus (upper foot). Also unlike Microraptor, the hindwing feathers were longest closer to the body, with the foot feathers being short and directed downward, almost perpendicular to the foot bones.|$|E
25|$|Only {{the faintest}} traces of primary {{segmentation}} remain in mites, the prosoma and opisthosoma being insensibly fused, and {{a region of}} flexible cuticle (the cirumcapitular furrow) separates the chelicerae and pedipalps {{from the rest of}} the body. This anterior body region is called the gnathosoma (or capitulum) and is also found in the Ricinulei. The remainder of the body is called the idiosoma and is unique to mites. Most adult mites have four pairs of <b>legs,</b> <b>like</b> other arachnids, but some have fewer. For example, gall mites like Phyllocoptes variabilis (superfamily Eriophyioidea) have a wormlike body with only two pairs of legs; some parasitic mites have only one or three pairs of legs in the adult stage. Larval and prelarval stages have a maximum of three pairs of legs; adult mites with only three pairs of legs may be called 'larviform'.|$|E

25|$|Jumping spiders are {{generally}} diurnal, active hunters. Their well-developed internal hydraulic system extends their limbs by altering {{the pressure of}} body fluid (hemolymph) within them. This enables the spiders to jump without having large muscular <b>legs</b> <b>like</b> a grasshopper. Most jumping spiders can jump several times the length of their bodies. When a jumping spider is moving from place to place, and especially just before it jumps, it tethers a filament of silk (or 'dragline') to whatever it is standing on to protect itself if the jump should fail. Should it fall, for example if the prey shakes it off, it climbs back up the silk tether. Some species, such as Portia, will actually let themselves down to attack prey such as a web spider apparently secure {{in the middle of}} its web. Like many other spiders that leave practically continuous silk trails, jumping spiders impregnate the silk line with pheromones that play a role in social and reproductive communication, and possibly in navigation.|$|E

It is a see-through silk chiffon dress with a tropical leaf and bamboo pattern, with a citrine-studded crotch. The dress [...] "had a low-cut neck that extended several inches below her navel, where it was loosely fastened with a sparkly brooch and then opened out again," [...] exposing her midriff and then cut along the front of the <b>legs</b> <b>like</b> a bath robe.

Some paid to take cuts of Ellen's hair, until the [...] "supply" [...] began to run out. A Bucks Free Press journalist recounted his visit: Her breathing was regular and natural, the skin soft and the body warm, as in a healthy subject; the pulse rather fast. The hands were small and thin, but the fingers quite flexible; the body somewhat emaciated; the feet and <b>legs</b> <b>like</b> those of a dead child, almost ice cold... the aspect of her features was pleasant, more so than might be expected under the circumstances... her eyes and cheeks were sunken, and the appearance was that of death... but although there was no colour on her cheeks, the paleness was not that heavy hue which betokens death.|$|E

When attacked it plays dead and exudes an obnoxious yellowish fluid from glands in the joints of the <b>legs.</b> <b>Like</b> all butterflies protected in this manner, Acraea terpsicore has a tough exoskeleton which enables the adult to survive a few pecks of a bird or even the bites of a lizard.

2500|$|The Chilean recluse {{is one of}} {{the larger}} species of recluse spiders, {{generally}} ranging from 8–40mm in size (including <b>legs).</b> <b>Like</b> most recluses, it is brown and usually has markings on the dorsal side of its thorax, with a black line coming from it that looks like a violin with the neck of the violin pointing {{to the rear of the}} spider resulting in the nickname [...] "fiddleback spider" [...] or [...] "violin spider" [...] in English-speaking areas. Coloring varies from light tan to brown and the violin marking may not be visible. Since the [...] "violin pattern" [...] is not diagnostic, it is far more important, for purposes of identification, to examine the eyes. Most spiders have eight eyes, but recluse spiders have six eyes arranged in pairs (dyads) with one median pair and two lateral pairs.|$|E
2500|$|Many animals {{temporarily}} {{change the}} number of legs they use for locomotion in different circumstances. For example, many quadrupedal animals switch to bipedalism to reach low-level browse on trees. The genus of Basiliscus are arboreal lizards that usually use quadrupedalism in the trees. [...] When frightened, they can drop to water below and run across the surface on their hind limbs at about 1.5m/s for a distance of approximately [...] before they sink to all fours and swim. [...] They can also sustain themselves on all fours while [...] "water-walking" [...] to increase the distance travelled above the surface by about 1.3 metres. [...] When cockroaches run rapidly, they rear up on their two hind <b>legs</b> <b>like</b> bipedal humans; this allows them to run at speeds up to 50 body lengths/s, equivalent to a [...] "couple hundred miles per hour, if you scale up {{to the size of}} humans".|$|E

[...] As Leonte took up positions in various ports along the Danube, the family moved to Galaţi and then Giurgiu. [...] In Galaţi, the toddler George found and, placing it between his <b>legs</b> <b>like</b> a cello, began playing a violin that his father had won in a raffle; Leonte, who did not want his son to be a [...] "fiddler", was not pleased, but nonetheless Georgescu began violin lessons at age five. [...] Later, he would transfer his attention to the cello. [...] While in elementary school, he composed a waltz that impressed the school's music teacher, who thereafter called on George as a substitute school choir director.|$|E
