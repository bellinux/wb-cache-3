40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to acts <b>of</b> {{corporations}} as <b>the</b> main factor in <b>the</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> participation in corporations.

The changes affected not only <b>the</b> Civil code <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian Federation (hereinafter- the CC), but <b>the</b> Federal law <b>of</b> 08. 02. 1998 No. 14 -FL “On limited liability companies", the Federal law dated 26. 12. 1995 No. 208 -FL "On joint stock companies". <b>The</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> participation is associated primarily with <b>the</b> disappearance <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> membership relationship. It is either a liquidation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corporation, <b>the</b> output <b>of</b> member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corporation, or conclusion of disposing civil transactions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>the</b> price <b>bid</b> for a takeover target, <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> succeeding and <b>the</b> target 2 ̆ 7 s price over <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bid.</b> We test and reject Samuelson and Rosenthal 2 ̆ 7 s (1986) expected value hypothesis. We find that over <b>the</b> <b>bid,</b> <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target <b>of</b> a successful bid typically rises towards <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> price, but is not observed to converge with <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> price. This lack of observed convergenece appears {{to be due to}} an early cessation of trading in many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bids</b> that succeed. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>bids</b> that fail, <b>the</b> target 2 ̆ 7 s share price is typically observed to rise above <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> price early in <b>the</b> <b>bid.</b> We consider several explanations for this, and suggest that <b>the</b> expectation <b>of</b> a subsequent <b>bid</b> is <b>the</b> most plausible explanation. This is supported by our empirical evidence. We also find that in the cases where <b>the</b> <b>bids</b> fail, early cessation of trading did not occur in <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> cases...|$|R

Daniel asks the angel how long the [...] "little horn" [...] will be triumphant, and the angel replies that the Temple will be reconsecrated after 2,300 [...] "evenings and mornings" [...] have passed (Daniel 8:14). The angel is counting the two daily sacrifices, so the period is 1,150 days from the desecration in December 167. In chapter 12 the angel gives three more dates: the desolation will last [...] "for a time, times and half a time", or a year, two years, and a half a year (Daniel 12:8); then that the [...] "desolation" [...] will last for 1,290 days (12:11); and finally, 1,335 days (12:12).
