5|$|The main or primary bronchi {{enter the}} lungs at the hilum and {{initially}} branch into secondary bronchi {{also known as}} <b>lobar</b> bronchi that supply air to each lobe of the lung. The <b>lobar</b> bronchi branch into tertiary bronchi also known as segmental bronchi and these supply air to the further divisions of the lobes known as bronchopulmonary segments. Each bronchopulmonary segment has its own (segmental) bronchus and arterial supply. Segments for {{the left and right}} lung are shown in the table. The segmental anatomy is useful clinically for localising disease processes in the lungs. A segment is a discrete unit that can be surgically removed without seriously affecting surrounding tissue.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{disagreed}} {{over the}} identity of the doctor who pronounced Beiderbecke dead. The official cause of death, meanwhile, was <b>lobar</b> pneumonia, with scholars continuing to debate the extent to which his alcoholism was also a factor. Beiderbecke's mother and brother took the train to New York and brought his body home to Davenport. He was buried there on August 11 in the family plot at Oakdale Cemetery.|$|E

The official causes of death were <b>lobar</b> pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer, but Parker also had an advanced case of cirrhosis and had suffered a heart attack. The coroner who performed his autopsy mistakenly estimated Parker's 34-year-old body to be between 50 and 60 years of age.|$|E
25|$|The first bronchi {{to branch}} from the trachea {{are the right}} and left main bronchi. Second only in {{diameter}} to the trachea (1.8cm), these bronchi (1 -1.4cm in diameter) enter the lungs at each hilum, where they branch into narrower secondary bronchi known as <b>lobar</b> bronchi, and these branch into narrower tertiary bronchi known as segmental bronchi. Further divisions of the segmental bronchi (1 to 6mm in diameter) are known as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th order segmental bronchi, or grouped together as subsegmental bronchi.|$|E
25|$|Currently, an {{estimated}} 60 to 75% of diagnosed dementias {{are of the}} Alzheimer's and mixed (Alzheimer's and vascular dementia) type, 10 to 15% are Lewy body type, with the remaining types being of an entire spectrum of dementias, including frontotemporal <b>lobar</b> degeneration (Pick's disease), alcoholic dementia, pure vascular dementia, etc. Dementia with Lewy bodies tends to be under-recognized. Dementia with Lewy bodies is slightly more prevalent in men than women. DLB increases in prevalence with age; the mean age at presentation is 75 years.|$|E

25|$|An {{outbreak}} of measles {{in the later}} part of October 1917 kept the men from drilling. Regardless, in January, 1918, the National Guard Reserve {{was transferred to the}} active list. However, in the same month, Alexandria, Louisiana, was made off limits, and visits by other regiments were banned due to an {{outbreak of}} meningitis. During this time, the soldiers were instructed in the use of deadly gases and then exposed to tear gas. The curfew concerning Alexandria lasted until 6 March 1918. The soldiers complained about the bugs and were anxious to go to France. By March 1918, the soldiers had received new Enfield rifles. In early October, 1918, after the departure of most Arkansas soldiers, Camp Beauregard was struck by Spanish influenza which led into <b>lobar</b> pneumonia; all available facilities were used and hospitals became overcrowded.|$|E
25|$|HUS {{was first}} {{defined as a}} {{syndrome}} in 1955. The more common form of the disease, Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli HUS (STEC-HUS), is triggered by the infectious agent E. coli O157:H7, and several other non-O157:H7 E. coli serotypes. Certain Shiga toxin-secreting strains of Shigella dysenteriae can also cause HUS. Approximately 5% of cases are classified as pneumococcal HUS, which results from infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae, the agent that causes traditional <b>lobar</b> pneumonia. There is also a rare, chronic, and severe form known as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), which is caused by genetic defects resulting in chronic, uncontrolled complement activation. Both STEC-HUS and aHUS cause endothelial damage, leukocyte activation, platelet activation, and widespread inflammation and multiple thromboses in the small blood vessels, a condition known as systemic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which leads to thrombotic events as well as organ damage/failure and death.|$|E

500|$|While PrP is {{considered}} the only mammalian prion, prion-like domains {{have been found in}} a variety of other mammalian proteins. Some of these proteins have been implicated in the ontogeny of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, known as Motor Neurone Disease outside the US), [...] frontotemporal <b>lobar</b> degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U), Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease, as well as some forms of Systemic Amyloidosis including AA (Secondary) Amyloidosis that develops in humans and animals with inflammatory and infectious diseases such as Tuberculosis, Crohn's disease, Rheumatoid arthritis, and HIV AIDS. AA amyloidosis, like prion disease, may be transmissible. [...] This has given rise to the 'prion paradigm', where otherwise harmless proteins can be converted to a pathogenic form by a small number of misfolded, nucleating proteins.|$|E

2500|$|A lobe {{transplant}} is a {{surgery in}} {{which part of}} a living or deceased donor's lung is removed and used to replace the recipient's diseased lung. In living donation, this procedure requires the donation of lobes from two different people, replacing a lung {{on each side of}} the recipient. Donors who have been properly screened should be able to maintain a normal quality of life despite the reduction in lung volume. [...] In deceased <b>lobar</b> transplantation, one donor can provide both lobes.|$|E

2500|$|In early June, {{the report}} was {{finalized}} and signed {{by a panel of}} four psychiatrists: Dr. Bernhard von Gudden, chief of the Munich Asylum; Dr. Hubert von Grashey (who was Gudden's son-in-law); and their colleagues, Dr. Friedrich Wilhelm Hagen and Dr. Max Hubrich. The report declared in its final sentences that the king suffered from paranoia, and concluded, [...] "Suffering from such a disorder, freedom of action can no longer be allowed and Your Majesty is declared incapable of ruling, which incapacity will be not only for a year's duration, but for the length of Your Majesty's life." [...] The men had never met the king, except for Gudden, only once, twelve years earlier, and none had ever examined him. Questions about the lack of medical diagnosis make the legality of the deposition controversial. Adding to the controversy are the mysterious circumstances under which King Ludwig died. (Today the claim of paranoia is not considered correct; Ludwig's behavior is rather interpreted as a schizotypal personality disorder and he may also have suffered from Pick's disease during his last years, an assumption supported by a frontotemporal <b>lobar</b> degeneration mentioned in the autopsy report.) ...|$|E

Moreover, the authors' experience with living donor <b>lobar</b> transplant suggests that size matching is critical to successful outcome.
