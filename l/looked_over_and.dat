25|$|The London University {{of which}} De Morgan was a {{professor}} was a different institution from the University of London. The University of London was founded about ten years later by the Government {{for the purpose of}} granting degrees after examination, without any qualification as to residence. The London University was affiliated as a teaching college with the University of London, and its name was changed to University College. The University of London was not a success as an examining body; a teaching University was demanded. De Morgan was a highly successful teacher of mathematics. It was his plan to lecture for an hour, and at the close of each lecture to give out a number of problems and examples illustrative of the subject lectured on; his students were required to sit down to them and bring him the results, which he <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> returned revised before the next lecture. In De Morgan's opinion, a thorough comprehension and mental assimilation of great principles far outweighed in importance any merely analytical dexterity in the application of half-understood principles to particular cases.|$|E

He was tall, he was thin, {{and the way he}} was galloping it looked as though he was going someplace much more important than the podium. ... He got to the podium—and I sat up straight. I was impressed with him.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1960s, {{a leading}} {{figure in the}} civil rights {{movement}} was Martin Luther King Jr., who was called [...] "a modern Moses," [...] and often referred to Moses in his speeches: [...] "The struggle of Moses, the struggle of his devoted followers as they sought to get out of Egypt.

6000|$|... 'Do you know, I think I {{have found}} out. She held aloof from us all, and treated us--especially me--as {{if we were}} her natural enemies, and I never could guess what was the reason till the other day; she voluntarily gave me up all her books to be <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> put into the common stock, which {{you saw in the}} schoolroom.' ...|$|E

60|$|But this ecstasy did not last. She felt {{eventually}} his shallowness and narrowness. He was vain and ungenerous.

6000|$|Jerry and I sat a {{great deal}} at ours, {{laughing}} and talking, but Miss Ponsonby never lifted her head or eyes. Jerry couldn't stand it long; she declared it got on her nerves; besides, she felt sorry to see a fellow creature wasting so many precious moments of a fleeting lifetime at patchwork.

6000|$|I {{threaded}} {{a sufficient}} number of loops, trying the length over the edge. Then I said to Elsie, who sat cowering, propped against the crag, 'You must come <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> do as I wave to you. Mind, dear, you must! Two lives depend upon it.' ...|$|R

She is so dreadfully fussy and particular. She won't let even Gillian read anything she hasn't <b>looked</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> she doesn't like anything that isn't goody goody.' ...|$|E

We didn't know how long we'd been over it. There warn't no trees, nor hills, nor rocks, nor towns, and Tom and Jim had took it for the sea. They took it for the sea in a dead ca'm; but we was so high up, anyway, that if it had been the sea and rough, it would 'a' looked smooth, all the same, in the night, that way.|$|E

50|$|A {{balance sheet}} {{recession}} happens when companies/banks <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> notice their balance sheet has occurred an error.
