25|$|As {{children}} {{gain more}} {{roles and responsibilities}} within their families, their eagerness to participate also increases. For example, Young Mayan children of San Pedro, Guatemala <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{in the fields and}} family run businesses because they are motivated to contribute to their family. Many San Pedro women learned to weave by watching their mothers sew when they were children, sometimes earning their own wool through doing small tasks such as watching young children of busy mothers. Eager to learn and contribute, these young girls helped other members of their community in order to help their mothers with their weaving businesses or through other tasks such as helping carry water while young boys helped with tasks such as carrying firewood alongside their fathers.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes {{called the}} 'patrol method.' Scouts are {{organised}} {{in small groups}} (about five to seven Scouts) {{because this is the}} natural way boys work together. These patrols are therefore more important than the Scout troop. Patrols must be kept intact under all circumstances, including working, tenting, learning, cooking, and surviving together. In a Patrol the Scouts <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with others, while the Patrol leader learns responsibility for others. Both have to give up part of their personal interest for this. However, Scouting deals with the individual, not with the Company. A Scout has his own identity within the group and learns as an individual. The Patrol serves as the character school for the individual. Younger sections, such as Cub Scouts and Beaver Scouts, are divided into sixes (Cubs) or lodges (Beavers). While Beaver lodges have no leader structure, Cub sixes have a sixer and seconder.|$|E

500|$|Expectations ran {{high among}} {{supporters}} of a post-liberal, post-Marxist politics, and {{the governing council}} did initiate several projects.

[...] In addition, a [...] "Transformation Platform" [...] attempted to synthesize left- and right-wing approaches to dozens of public policy issues. [...] But within three years the Alliance fell apart, unable to establish stable chapters in any major cities. [...] Author Jerome Clark suggests the cause was the Alliance's commitment to consensus-building in all its groups and projects; within months, he notes, one member was complaining that the Alliance {{had turned into a}} [...] "diddler's cult". [...] Another explanation focuses on the failure– or inability– of the hyper-democratic questionnaire process to select an appropriate governing council.|$|E

500|$|Voyager {{takes place}} {{at about the same}} time period as Deep Space Nine and the years {{following}} that show's end (2371–2378). The premiere episode has the USS Voyager and its crew pursue a Maquis (Federation rebels) ship. Both ships become stranded in the Delta Quadrant about 70,000 light-years from Earth. Faced with a 75-year voyage to Earth, the crew must <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> together to overcome challenges on their long and perilous journey home while also seeking ways to shorten the voyage. Like Deep Space Nine, early seasons of Voyager feature more conflict between its crewmembers than seen in later episodes. Such conflict often arises from friction between [...] "by-the-book" [...] Starfleet crew and rebellious Maquis fugitives forced by circumstance to work together on Voyager. Eventually, though, they settle their differences, after which the overall tone becomes more reminiscent of The Original Series. The starship Voyager, isolated from its home, faces new cultures and dilemmas not possible in shows based in the Alpha Quadrant. Later seasons, however, brought an influx of characters and cultures from prior shows, the Borg, Q, the Ferengi, Romulans, Klingons, Cardassians and cast members of The Next Generation.|$|E

2500|$|Yellow Cab of Pittsburgh is {{the main}} taxicab company in Pittsburgh, with over 300 {{vehicles}} in its fleet, all later model sedans and vans in good, PUC-inspected condition, as mandated by the Public Utility Commission of Pennsylvania. Most of the cabs are leased by drivers, but a very slight few are owner-operated. In addition to the typical Yellow Cab vehicles, there is a Green Cab (ecologically green), a few Pink Cabs (to promote breast cancer awareness), a Red Cab (to promote heart health) and a couple Blue Cabs (to promote prostate health). Cabs which bear the designation [...] "METRO" [...] on their tail ends denote probationary cab drivers, who are required to drive Metros until at least one month has passed {{since the end of}} their training; the actual amount of time before a new driver may drive a [...] "Yellow" [...] is determined on a case-by-case basis.

2500|$|In 1911, {{organized}} labor erupted with strong opposition to scientific management, spreading from Samuel Gompers, {{founder and president}} of the American Federal of Labor (AFL), in the US to far around the globe.

Again in 1914, Lenin derided Taylorism as [...] "man’s enslavement by the machine." [...] However, after the Russian Revolutions brought him to power, Lenin wrote in 1918 that the [...] "Russian is a bad worker [...] <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> The Taylor system... is a combination of the refined brutality of bourgeois exploitation and a number of the greatest scientific achievements in the field of analysing mechanical motions during work, the elimination of superfluous and awkward motions, the elaboration of correct methods of work, the introduction of the best system of accounting and control, etc. The Soviet Republic must at all costs adopt all that is valuable in the achievements of science and technology in this field." ...|$|E

2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: I pretty much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, and I think what happened last night was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E
