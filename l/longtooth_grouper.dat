40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{examines}} {{the effects on}} fertilization rate (FR), hatching rate (HR), and normal individual rate after artificial fertilization using frozen thawed sperm according to the cryoprotectant (DMSO) concentration and the period of cryopreserved sperm of <b>longtooth</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus bruneus. Performing artificial fertilization using frozen-thawed sperm, after freezing the sperm at different DMSO concentration of 5. 0 %, 7. 5 %, 10. 0 % respectively, FR were (DMSO 5. 0 %: 99. 5 ± 0. 8 %, DMSO 7. 5 %: 99. 5 ± 0. 7 %, and DMSO 10. 0 %: 99. 6 ± 0. 6 %). The results are {{not significantly different from}} the control fresh sperm (100 %). HR also (DMSO 5. 0 %: 96. 2 ± 2. 3 %, DMSO 7. 5 %: 95. 3 ± 3. 6 %, 10. 0 %: 96. 6 ± 1. 8 %) were not significantly different in each group. The normal individual rate after hatching using with control fresh sperm (98. 4 %± 0. 5) and DMSO concentration level of 5. 0 % (97. 8 ± 0. 1 %) were not significantly different. However, with 7. 5 % (97. 2 ± 0. 6 %) and 10. 0 % DMSO concentrations (95. 9 ± 0. 2 %) are lower than the normal individual rate after hatching observed in the control and 5. 0 % DMSO. Performing artificial fertilization using frozen-thawed sperm at different froze...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Puberty is the {{developmental}} period which animals obtain {{the ability of}} reproducing sexually {{for the first time}} in life. In commercially important aquaculture fish species, the onset of puberty is a matter of major interest due to controlling of sexual maturation to improve broodstock management. To investigate pubertal characteristics of female <b>longtooth</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus bruneus), specimens were classified into three groups by the bodyweight, including 1, 2, and 3 kg group. Thereafter, we focused on ovarian development and level changes of endocrine regulation factors (GnRH, GTHs, steroid hormone). In the non-breeding season (April), the levels of endocrine regulation factors showed increasing trends in accordance with bodyweight gaining; nevertheless, the oocytes were growth phase belongs to almost peri-nucleous stages in all groups. In the breeding season (June), the levels of endocrine regulation factors were fluctuated that decreases in levels of sbGnRH and FSHβ mRNA expressions along with serum E 2 concentrations in 3 kg of group. However, LHβ mRNA expression levels sustained increasing trends by the bodyweight. Moreover, the oocytes developed that 2 kg and 3 kg groups obtained plentiful vitellogenic oocytes while 1 kg group was still composed with greater part of pre-vitellogenic oocytes. Especially, the oocytes of 3 kg group reached over 450 µm of diameters that indicating possibility to enter the final maturations. These results suggest that the progress of pubertal development in female E. bruneus could be classif...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of 17 α-methyltestosterone (MT) on growth and induced sex change in the <b>longtooth</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus bruneus. The growth rate for body weight (GRW) and specific growth rate (SGR) of the group injected with MT over 8 weeks were significantly higher than those of the sham-injected control group, the group injected over 4 weeks, and the control group. Of the orally administrated groups, the GRWs of the control group and the group given 1 kg of feed with 2. 0 mg of MT were highest and did not significantly differ from one another. For SGR, the treatment groups differed significantly, and the SGR of the control group was higher than those of the other groups (P< 0. 05). The condition factor (CF) of the group injected over 4 weeks was higher than those injected over 8 weeks, the sham-injected control group over 8 weeks, and the control group. The CF did not significantly differ between the sham-injected control group over 8 weeks and the injected group over 8 weeks, but these two groups differed from the control group (P< 0. 05). The CFs of the groups given 1 kg of feed with 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 mg of MT were significantly higher than that of the control group (P< 0. 05). The feed efficiency ratio was not significantly affected by MT administration. Most of the experimental groups receiving MT developed many unidentified germ cell cysts and perinucleolus oocytes, although neither spermazoa cells nor sex-changed males were observed in any of the treatments...|$|E
