40|$|Bone {{stores of}} lead accrued from {{environmental}} exposures and {{found in most}} of the general population have recently been linked to the development of hypertension, cognitive decrements, and adverse reproductive outcomes. The skeleton is the major endogenous source of lead in circulating blood, particularly under conditions of accelerated bone turnover and mineral loss, such as during pregnancy and in postmenopausal osteoporosis. We studied the influence of bone resorption rate on the release of lead from bone in 333 men, predominantly white, middle-aged and elderly (mostly retired) from the Boston area. We evaluated bone resorption by measuring cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx) in 24 -hr urine samples with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We used K-X-ray fluorescence <b>to</b> measure <b>lead</b> content in cortical (tibia) and trabecular (patella) bone; we used graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy <b>to</b> measure <b>lead</b> in blood and urine, respectively. After adjustment for age and creatinine clearance, the positive relation of patella <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> urinary <b>lead</b> was stronger among subjects in the upper two NTx tertiles (beta for patella lead > or = 0. 015) than in the lowest NTx tertile (beta for patella lead = 0. 008; overall p-value for interactions = 0. 06).
