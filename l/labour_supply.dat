25|$|Higher pay for {{overtime}} hours {{can reduce}} or negate {{the effect of}} a backward bending <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> curve, by increasing wages only for hours worked beyond a certain amount. Overtime maintains the substitution effect at a high <b>labour</b> <b>supply.</b> However, the income effect from the wages increasing on all the previous hours worked is eliminated. Thus, higher hourly overtime pay can cause workers to work more hours than if the higher rate is paid on all hours.|$|E
25|$|The above {{examines}} {{only the}} effect of changing wage rates on workers already subject to those rates; only those individuals' <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> response was considered. The additional labour supplied by workers working in other sectors (or unemployed), who are now more attracted to the jobs in the sector because it is paying higher wages, was nor considered. Thus, for a given market, the wage at which the <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> curve bends backward may be higher than the wage at which a given worker's curve bends back.|$|E

25|$|Another {{factor was}} the Chinese Civil War. After the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chinese capitalists bought {{huge numbers of}} {{machines}} and facilities to restore their pre-war production. As the Civil War broke out, many capitalists moved those facilities to Hong Kong warehouses to continue production. Furthermore, industrialists from Tianjin, Shanghai and Guangzhou relocated to Hong Kong because of the Chinese Civil War. They brought skilled labour, technology and capital to the city. Many Mainlanders also fled to Hong Kong, contributing to the city's <b>labour</b> <b>supply.</b> Altogether, some US$100,000,000 were brought to Hong Kong because of the war. After the war, the facilities and equipment stayed in Hong Kong, causing the rise of Hong Kong's manufacturing industry.

They focus their study on five Asian nations including India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines. They suggest that child labour {{is a serious problem}} in all five, {{but it is not a}} new problem. Macroeconomic causes encouraged widespread child labour across the world, over most of human history. They suggest that the causes for child labour include both the demand and the supply side. While poverty and unavailability of good schools explain the child <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> side, they suggest that the growth of low-paying informal economy rather than higher paying formal economy is amongst the causes of the demand side. Other scholars too suggest that inflexible labour market, sise of informal economy, inability of industries to scale up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour.|$|E

2500|$|In economics, a backward-bending supply {{curve of}} labour, or backward-bending <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> curve, is a {{graphical}} device showing {{a situation in}} which as real, or inflation-corrected, wages increase beyond a certain level, people will substitute leisure (non-paid time) for paid worktime and so higher wages lead to a decrease in the <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> and so less labour-time being offered for sale.|$|E

2500|$|The {{model is}} {{commonly}} applied to wages, {{in the market}} for labor. The typical roles of supplier and demander are reversed. The suppliers are individuals, who try to sell their labor for the highest price. The demanders of labor are businesses, which try to buy the type of labor they need at the lowest price. The equilibrium price for a certain type of labor is the wage rate. However, economist Steve Fleetwood revisited the empirical reality of supply and demand curves in labor markets and concluded that the evidence is [...] "at best inconclusive and at worst casts doubt on their existence."

He succeeded in maximizing the British <b>labour</b> <b>supply,</b> for both the armed services and domestic industrial production, with a minimum of strikes and disruption. His most important role came as Foreign Secretary in the post-war Labour Government, 1945–51. He gained American financial support, strongly opposed Communism, and aided in the creation of NATO. Bevin's tenure also saw the end of the Mandate of Palestine and the creation of the State of Israel. His biographer, Alan Bullock, said that Bevin [...] "stands as the last of the line of foreign secretaries in the tradition created by Castlereagh, Canning and Palmerston {{in the first half of}} the 19th century," [...] and that due to the reduction in British power he has no successors.|$|E
2500|$|The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) {{spoke out}} in {{opposition}} to the possibility of permanent residence for FDHs, citing its potential high costs. DAB legislator Starry Lee predicted that 125,000 FDHs would each sponsor an average of three dependents to come to Hong Kong, meaning a total of 500,000 persons newly eligible for government programmes such as public education, housing subsidies, and Comprehensive Social Security Assistance, leading to {{tens of billions of dollars}} in additional public expenditures. Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions legislator Pan Pey-chyou also expressed concern that increasing the <b>labour</b> <b>supply</b> by giving FDHs the freedom to pursue other employment could put other workers at a disadvantage. Lee's fellow DAB legislator Chan Kam-lam stated that the party had collected 91,500 signatures in 18 electoral districts, of whom all but 210 were {{in opposition to}} granting FDHs the right of abode.

2500|$|The {{revenue of}} Perak in 1874 {{amounted}} to $226,333. [...] That for 1905 amounted to $12,242,897. Of this latter sum $4,876,400 {{was derived from}} duty on exported tin, $2,489,300 from railway receipts, $505,300 from land revenue and $142,800 from postal and telegraphic revenue. [...] The remainder is mainly derived from the revenue farms, which are leased for a short term of years, conveying to the lessee the right to collect import duties upon opium, wine and spirits, to keep pawnbroking shops, and to keep public licensed gambling-houses {{for the use of}} non-Malay only. [...] The expenditure for 1905 amounted to $10,141,980. Of this sum $4,236,000 was expended upon railway upkeep and construction and $2,176,100 upon public works. [...] The value of the imports into Perak during 1905 was over $20,000,000, and that of the exports exceeded $40,000,000, making a total of over $60,000,000, equivalent to about seven million sterling. The output of tin from Perak ranged between 18,960 tons, valued at $23,099,506 in 1899, and 26,600 tons, valued at $35,500,000, in 1905. [...] The fluctuating character of the output was due to the uncertainty of the <b>labour</b> <b>supply.</b> The mining population was recruited exclusively from the districts of southern China, and during certain years an increased demand for labourers in China itself, in French Indo-China, in the Dutch colonies, and in South Africa temporarily and adversely affected immigration to the Straits of Malacca. [...] The output had, moreover, been affected from time to time by the price of tin, which was $32.20 per pikul in 1896, rose to $42.96 in 1898, to $74.15 in 1900, and averaged $80.60 in 1905. [...] Exclusive of tin, the principal exports were $108,000 worth of Para rubber, $181,000 of copra, $54,000 of hides, $48,000 of patchouli, and considerable quantities of timber, rattans and other jungle produce.|$|E
