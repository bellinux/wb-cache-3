25|$|Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia! Georgia {{is facing}} the most {{difficult}} days, especially Sukhumi. Separatists and foreign invaders entered into the city. I am proud of your courage... Separatists and opportunists will be judged by history... They do not want Georgians {{to live in this}} Georgian city. Many of them dream to repeat the Gagra tragedy here... I know that you understand the challenge we are facing. I know how difficult the situation is. Many people left the city but you remain here for Sukhumi and for Georgia.... I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to hold our ground. We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi. I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call on you to keep peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E
500|$|At 09:39, {{two minutes}} after Flight 77 {{impacted}} the Pentagon, {{air traffic controllers}} overheard Jarrah say, [...] "Here's the captain: I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all to remain seated. We have a bomb aboard, {{and we are going}} back to the airport, and we have our demands. So please remain quiet." [...] Air traffic controllers did not hear from the flight again. Passengers and crew began making phone calls to officials and family members starting at 09:30 using GTE airphones and mobile phones. Altogether, the passengers and crew made 35 airphone calls and two cell phone calls from the flight. Ten passengers and two crew members were able to connect, providing information to family, friends, and others on the ground.|$|E
2500|$|The IBM {{archives}} of Frequently Asked Questions notes an inquiry {{about whether he}} said in the 1950s that he foresaw a market potential for only five electronic computers. The document says no, but quotes his son and then IBM President Thomas J. Watson, Jr., at the annual IBM stockholders meeting, April 28, 1953, as speaking about the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine, which it identifies as [...] "the company's first production computer designed for scientific calculations". He said that [...] "IBM had developed a paper plan for such a machine and took this paper plan across the country to some 20 concerns that we thought could use such a machine. I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that the machine rents for between $12,000 and $18,000 a month, so it was not the type of thing that could be sold from place to place. But, {{as a result of our}} trip, on which we expected to get orders for five machines, we came home with orders for 18." [...] Watson, Jr., later gave a slightly different version of the story in his autobiography, where he said the initial market sampling indicated 11 firm takers and 10 more prospective orders.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed. And a whole army {{of accusations}} {{has been brought}} against him. I have never <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> and yet I {{do not think that}} you should be left in the dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> another story? It {{is about}} a little girl. Well, {{there was once a}} {{minister}} and his wife, and they hadn't no little girls, but just little boys, and God was sorry for them, so He put a little girl in a cabbage in the garden, and when they found her they were glad. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> who the little girl was? Well, it was me, and, ugh! I was awful cold in the cabbage. Do you like that story?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That depends. I really don’t want {{to cause}} you trouble. You see, I {{was fond of}} you once, Tony—and would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that I am still?” ...|$|R
2500|$|Wen has {{progressively}} amped up {{his liberal}} rhetoric as his Premiership continued, remarking in August 2010 that [...] "Without political reform, China may lose {{what it has}} already achieved through economic restructuring". Wen's comments were largely censored in state media, but he gained support {{from a group of}} some 23 party elders in October, who denounced the authorities' censorship of Wen's remarks in an open letter to the National People's Congress. In an interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN's Global Public Square television program aired in October 2010, Wen made the following statement: [...] "I have summed up my political ideals into the following four sentences. [...] To let everyone lead a happy life with dignity. [...] To let everyone feel safe and secure. [...] To let the society be one with equity and justice. [...] And to let everyone have confidence in the future. [...] In spite of the various discussions and views in the society, and in spite of some resistance, I will act in accordance with these ideals unswervingly, and advance within the realm of my capabilities political restructuring. [...] I will <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the following two sentences to reinforce my view on this point. [...] I will not fall in spite of the strong wind and harsh rain, and I will not yield until the last day of my life." [...] At the 2012 National People's Congress, Wen mentioned the word [...] "reform" [...] 70 times. He remarked that China must [...] "press ahead with both economic structural reforms and political structural reforms, in particular reforms on the leadership system of the Party and the country." [...] There is also indication from party insiders that Wen has been pushing the case for the political rehabilitation of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.|$|E

6000|$|... "I haven't insulted you, Mrs Stumfold. And if <b>you</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me, <b>you</b> needn't. I'm sure I did {{not want}} you to come to me and talk in this way." ...|$|R
6000|$|She scanned him keenly {{before she}} answered: [...] "Something that I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you--that <b>you</b> ought <b>to</b> know. Alan, {{do you think}} you are fit to judge of a very serious matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Seer {{stroked his}} chin softly. His eye {{appeared}} to {{me to have a}} furtive gleam in it. [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the number of a bank-note inclosed in an envelope?" [...] he asked casually.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish it was}} not; I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> very much, but then, you see, it is Norman's, and you are to be surprised." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She did that, {{and very}} movingly," [...] said Miss Grant. [...] "I would not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what she said--I find you vain enough already." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Still,” she said, “the man I {{mentioned}} did as much—not to win fame or {{a pardon}} for his sins, but {{to save a}} comrade who was not worthy of the sacrifice. <b>You</b> would <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about it?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What you'd <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> then," [...] she suggested, {{raising her}} eyes and looking at him thoughtfully, [...] "is that I've never wasted a thought on Jocelyn Thew, but that Mr. Reginald Crawshay is it with a capital 'I'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] exclaimed Gust, [...] "there {{is where}} you are wrong. [...] There {{is where you}} are lucky {{that you have an}} educated man <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what <b>to</b> do.

6000|$|... "She did that, {{and very}} movingly," [...] said Miss Grant. [...] "I would not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what she said, I find you vain enough already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes. She had {{a curious}} fascination. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about her. Do you think there's {{such a thing}} as a girl's being too innocent?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} time I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about my affairs before I started to come to Chicago," [...] I said. [...] "I would like your advice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} other, looking steadfastly at her companion, [...] "if you will promise {{to keep it}} all to {{yourself}} forever, I don't mind <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> that I was once in love. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> who I was in love with?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you politicians!" [...] he exclaimed, with {{pleasant}} superiority; [...] "you {{are always}} fighting {{about how things}} should be done, and the consequence is you are never able to do anything. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what a Unitarian horsedealer said to me at Brindisi about politicians?" ...|$|R
5000|$|However, the {{question}} : [...] "If God exists, what would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> Him <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> when you're dead ?" [...] was considered potentially offensive for the US audience, {{and replaced by}} a more accepted [...] "If heaven exists, what would you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates?".|$|R
6000|$|... "On the way back." [...] Here Berrie hesitated again. [...] "I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> mother, but he didn't fall, Cliff jumped him {{and tried}} to kill him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{that is in}} {{the clouds}} as yet. I did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> but you mustn't suppose that because I've told you, {{everything}} is settled. Nothing is settled." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Should you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> {{know that}} his own life is too base for words and that his impudence in talking about me would be sickening if it weren't grotesque?'

'Should <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> what he has stooped--to the very gutter--and the charming history of his relations with----' ...|$|R
2500|$|... "That Maxwell {{should spend}} his efforts upon a romanticized, {{literary}} past {{is no less}} legitimate than the preoccupation of a Chirico with long sad vistas in towns that never were. Maxwell is entitled to his moon-drenched graveyards as Poe was to his misty mid-regions. The only question we are permitted to ask is, [...] "How far can nostalgia go without becoming the mutterings {{of an old man}} in his beer (or his bourbon) who <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> ad infinitum, about things that have ceased to interest anyone but himself, and himself only because he has nothing better to do?" [...] What we are attempting to say to John Maxwell, then, his neighbor Tom Wolfe said to him and to Faulkner and to all the many talents of the modern South.

6000|$|He {{looked on}} the floor and then he looked at me, with a steady, earnest gaze. [...] "I should <b>like</b> well <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> my story," [...] he said.

6000|$|The {{minister}} rose. [...] "Then I really mustn't detain you, I suppose. Good-bye." [...] He {{offered his}} hand. Colville took it, {{but could not}} let it go at once.
