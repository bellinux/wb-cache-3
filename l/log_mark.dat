50|$|Men only {{raised the}} large logs; {{the rest of}} the work was done by women. Therefore, a lodge was {{considered}} to be owned by the woman who built it. A vestibule of exposed <b>logs</b> <b>marked</b> the entrance and provided an entryway; these vestibules were often a minimum of 6 to 9 ft in length (determined {{by the size of the}} lodge and resulting outer-clay thickness). A windbreak was built on the interior of the lodge, blocking the wind and giving privacy to the occupants. Earth lodges often also contained cache pits (root cellar-type holes) lined with willow and grasses, within which dried vegetables were stored.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} a mechatronic system, designed and {{developed for the}} forest industry, to trace logs from forest to sawmill. The research is {{a key part of}} a large research project launched by the EU in 2006 called the Indisputable Key project. Wood waste during harvesting, transportation and refinement is a major concern for the wood industry worldwide. Some raw materials are not suited for specific end products, and acknowledging this late in the wood value chain is cost inefficient. Pinpointing specific raw material suitable for a particular end product could increase quality, reduce waste and environmental impact; to accomplish this, traceability is essential. To trace the raw material of a final wood product to its origin, marking and reading of the different specimens must occur at each refining stage in the wood value chain. The traceability chain can be divided into three main stages: forest to sawmill, inside the sawmill, and from sawmill to second manufacturer. The research presented here covers {{the first part of the}} wood value chain, namely, forest to sawmill. In Scandinavian countries, logs are cut to length in the forest using a harvester machine. To trace logs, a unique identity code needs to be associated with each log at harvesting time in the forest and detected before further processing at the sawmill. Earlier research using RFID transponders as code carriers have been functionally verified but too costly. Although the cost of RFID transponders is declining, alternative methods are considered a necessity. This constitutes the main driver behind this thesis. The thesis presents a promising alternative <b>log</b> <b>marking</b> method comprising a harvester saw-integrated log code printer and a sawmill code detection system. An identity code in the form of a standard matrix code is applied via the harvester saw bar during cutting. A prototype has been designed and realized and the results point towards a both time and cost efficient solution. The code detection system, to be placed in one or more locations at the sawmill, is based on vision technology and image processing to detect the applied log codes. Both <b>log</b> code <b>marking</b> and reading systems communicate with an ICT system which maintains the traceability database. A major advantage of the system is that both marking and reading is performed without any time-loss and hence do not disturb the high pace production flow in todays forestry. Also, the item cost of each code mark is very low, compared to e. g. a transponder. The marking technology is patent pending. A field test was performed in December 2009 in northern Sweden. A test batch of 320 <b>logs</b> was <b>marked</b> and read. Two code structures (i. e., matrix and barcode) were applied, where 210 barcoded logs were used to demonstrate log traceability between forest and sawmill. This result indicates that this technology has potential. The prototype is not intended for commercial use, but serves merely to demonstrate the potential of the method; further research is needed to improve its functionality. QC 2011051...|$|R

40|$|Several {{methods are}} {{employed}} by the timber industry to try to restrict the flow of products from illegal or unsustainable sources into timber supply chains. The most commonly applied are systems of <b>log</b> <b>marking</b> and associated documentation that accompany the logs. However this system is open to falsification, particularly between the logging concession and the timber mill, {{where the majority of}} illegally logged timber enters the supply chain. This paper describes the development of a methodology to track a unique genetic fingerprint for single logs of merbau, Intsia palembanica (Leguminosae), a high-value Indonesian timber species, from logging concession to the mill, where the DNA profile of individual logs is difficult or impossible to falsify. We find that whilst the ability to extract DNA and amplify a PCR product from logs decreases slightly between forest concession (59. 2 %) and mill (41. 9 %) samples, that overall enough samples worked across the 14 microsatellite markers to provide an exact genotype match between forest and sawmill samples for 27 out of 32 logs. Furthermore for these 27 samples, the probability that an illegal log with an exact genotype match to forest samples had been substituted was very low (less than 10 – 5) for 18 samples, was low (between 10 – 2 and 10 – 4) for 7 samples and was moderate (10 – 1) for 2 samples. Improvements to DNA extraction and amplification success are recommended to improve this protocol, and there was a negative correlation between locus size and amplification success but a positive correlation with allele number. However, overall we propose that this methodology is now suitable for broad-scale industry application to track legally harvested timber and check for illegal substitutions along supply chains. A. J.

40|$|DoS/DDoS attacks {{constitute}} one of {{the major}} classes of security threats in the Internet today. The attackers usually use IP spoofing to conceal their real location. The current Internet protocols and infrastructure do not provide intrinsic support to traceback the real attack sources.

Different traceback methods have been proposed, such as IP <b>logging,</b> IP <b>marking</b> and IETF ICMP Traceback (ITrace). In this paper, we propose an enhancement to the ICMP Traceback approach, called ICMP Traceback with Cumulative Path (ITrace-CP). The enhancement consists in encoding the entire attack path information in the ICMP Traceback message. Analytical and simulation studies have been performed to evaluate the performance improvements.

40|$|As a help {{in stock}} {{assessment}} of pelagic, schooling fish a software for detection {{of schools and}} quantification of their size and swimming behaviour by a high resolution sonar has been developed. The system reads the echo telegrams that forms the display of the SIMRAD SA 950 sonar, and organize an echo table for the colour code value of each pixel {{for each of the}} 32 beams and 512 range rings of the sonar for each ping. The settings of the sonar is written to a separate table. Detection of schools is based on identification of echo lines which are defined as a minimum number of succeeding pixels with colour code value above a predetermined threshold. The position in the beam sector and horizontal extent for each echo line detected is written to a separate echo line table. A procedure then search through this table for identification of echo blocks which are defined as adjacent echo lines that extend above a certain width. The horizontal extent, depth, and geographic position of echo blocks are written to an echo block table together with information on time and vessel navigation. If an echo block is detected in a minimum number of succeeding pings, it is assigned a school number. It is possible to store both the echo table, the echo line table, and the echo block table on disk or take printouts directly. A colour printer echogram for use with the SIMRAD SA 950 has also been developed. For this purpose the sonar is interpreted as a sounder with a 45 ° beam, and the maximum colour code value for each range ring in the echo table is identified and printed. The printed echogram is divided by range lines and <b>log</b> <b>marks,</b> and there are indicators for tilt angle and train of the sonar beam.

Because of the limited marking space in the packet header, routers probabilistically decide to mark packets that they are forwarding.
