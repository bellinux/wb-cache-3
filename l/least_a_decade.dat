5|$|Market {{regulators}} in Asia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States {{began to}} investigate the $5 trillion-a-day foreign-exchange market after Bloomberg News reported in June 2013 {{that several of the}} world's largest currency trading banks had been front-running client orders and rigging the foreign exchange benchmark WM/Reuters rates by colluding with counterparts. The behavior occurred daily in the spot foreign-exchange market and went on for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> according to currency traders.|$|E
5|$|Moscow {{had built}} up a {{military}} that consumed as much as 25percent of the Soviet Union's gross national product {{at the expense of}} consumer goods and investment in civilian sectors. Soviet spending on the arms race and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system, which saw at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years.|$|E
5|$|While {{he still}} felt a disdain for public life, Tchaikovsky now {{participated in it}} for two reasons—his {{increasing}} celebrity, and what he felt was his duty to promote Russian music. To this end, he helped support his former pupil Sergei Taneyev, {{now director of the}} Moscow Conservatory, by attending student examinations and negotiating the sometimes sensitive relations among various members of the staff. Tchaikovsky also served as director of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society during the 1889–90 season. In this post, he invited a number of international celebrities to conduct, including Johannes Brahms, Antonín Dvořák and Jules Massenet. Tchaikovsky promoted Russian music both in his own compositions and in his role as a guest conductor. In January 1887 he substituted at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow on short notice for the first three performances of his opera Cherevichki. Conducting was something the composer had wanted to master for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade,</b> as he saw that success outside Russia depended to some extent on conducting his own works. Within a year of the Cherevichki performances, Tchaikovsky was in considerable demand throughout Europe and Russia, which helped him overcome a life-long stage fright and boosted his self-assurance.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{the movie}} Cabiria by Giovanni Pastrone (1914)—one {{of the first}} known films where a camera moves through scenes while filming—was once {{considered}} <b>a</b> masterpiece at <b>least</b> in part because D'Annunzio had written the captions, but to modern moviegoers they seem excessively emphatic and redundant. The {{same can be said}} of the marked gestures of many actors and actresses of the silent era. Bertini wanted to end this affected behavior, so she focused on realism. Her performances bear a closer resemblance to reality because of some acting devices: never look into the camera, use everyday gestures, and so on. The lunch scene in Assunta Spina, for example, still has impact because of these devices. The attempt to reflect reality also reduced the need for captions explaining the action. Even though only a single year passed between the release of Cabiria and Assunta Spina, there seems to be at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade's</b> worth of difference in artistic subtlety and nuance.|$|R
