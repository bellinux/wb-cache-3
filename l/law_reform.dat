40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effect of divorce <b>law</b> <b>reforms</b> on fertility. By modifying the value of marriage, the {{introduction}} of divorce <b>law</b> <b>reforms</b> may impact fertility decisions. To identify the effects of those reforms on fertility, we use a quasi-experiment exploiting the legislative history of divorce liberalization across Europe. Results suggest that divorce <b>law</b> <b>reforms</b> have a negative and permanent effect on fertility. Divorce reforms decreased the Total Fertility Rate by about 0. 2. The magnitude of the effect is sizable, {{taking into account that}} the average Total Fertility Rate declined from 2. 84 in 1960 to 1. 66 in 2006. These findings are robust to alternative specifications and controls for observed (such as the liberalization of abortion and the availability of the birth-control pill, among others) and unobserved country-specific factors, and time-varying factors at the country level. Supplemental analysis, developed to understand the mechanisms through which divorce <b>law</b> <b>reforms</b> affect fertility, shows that both marital and out-of-wedlock fertility decline, but that the impact on marital fertility varies, depending on whether couples are married prior to or after divorce <b>law</b> <b>reforms.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|In the Common Pleas, Blackstone {{operated}} under a civil jurisdiction {{rather than a}} mixed civil and criminal one.

40|$|After a 1996 firearm {{massacre}} in Tasmania in which 35 people died, Australian governments united to remove semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns and rifles from civilian possession, {{as a key}} component of gun <b>law</b> <b>reforms.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether Australia's 1996 major gun <b>law</b> <b>reforms</b> were associated with changes in rates of mass firearm homicides, total firearm deaths, firearm homicides and firearm suicides, and whether there were any apparent method substitution effects for total homicides and suicides. In the 18 years before the gun <b>law</b> <b>reforms,</b> there were 13 mass shootings in Australia, and none in the 10. 5 years afterwards. Declines in firearm-related deaths before the <b>law</b> <b>reforms</b> accelerated after the reforms for total firearm deaths (p?=? 0. 04), firearm suicides (p?=? 0. 007) and firearm homicides (p?=? 0. 15), but not for the smallest category of unintentional firearm deaths, which increased. No evidence of substitution effect for suicides or homicides was observed. The rates per 100 000 of total firearm deaths, firearm homicides and firearm suicides all at least doubled their existing rates of decline after the revised gun laws. Australia's 1996 gun <b>law</b> <b>reforms</b> were followed by more than a decade free of fatal mass shootings, and accelerated declines in firearm deaths, particularly suicides. Total homicide rates followed the same pattern. Removing large numbers of rapid-firing firearms from civilians may be an effective way of reducing mass shootings, firearm homicides and firearm suicides...|$|R

5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the <b>Law</b> <b>Reform</b> (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E
5|$|He {{was elected}} to Parliament in 1805 for Gatton, a rotten borough, and became Solicitor General for England and Wales in 1812 and Attorney General for England and Wales a year later. Although not happy in Parliament, having been {{returned}} only for political purposes, Garrow acted {{as one of the}} principal Whig spokesmen trying to stop criminal <b>law</b> <b>reform</b> as campaigned for by Samuel Romilly and also attempted to pass legislation to condemn animal cruelty. In 1817, he was made a Baron of the Exchequer and a Serjeant-at-Law, forcing his resignation from Parliament, and he spent the next 15 years as a judge. He was not particularly successful in the commercial cases the Exchequer specialised in, but when on Assize, used his criminal law knowledge from his years at the Bar to great effect. On his resignation in 1832 he was made a Privy Councillor, a sign of the respect HM Government had for him. He died on 24 September 1840.|$|E

He set up the Chief Justice's <b>Law</b> <b>Reform</b> Committee to try to ensure justice in Victoria's courts was abreast of the times, and a committee for religious observances and services to arrange the religious services marking the opening of the legal year. Herring retired as Chief Justice in 1964 but stayed on as Lieutenant Governor until his 80th birthday in 1972, serving in the position for a record 27 years. For his service as Lieutenant Governor, Herring was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the King's Birthday Honours of 9 June 1949.|$|E

5|$|The Hale Commission was {{established}} by the Commonwealth of England on 30 January 1652 and led by Sir Matthew Hale to investigate <b>law</b> <b>reform.</b> Consisting of eight lawyers and thirteen laymen, the Commission met approximately {{three times a week}} and proposed changes as radical (at the time) as reducing the use of the death penalty, allowing witnesses, legal aid and lawyers for defendants in criminal cases and creating County Courts and a Court of Appeal for criminal cases. Though the Commission was unsuccessful at passing any of its measures under the Rump Parliament, two of its measures were put into law by the subsequent Barebone's Parliament, and, {{by the middle of the}} 20th century, most of the others were as well. Debate has occurred over the effectiveness and strife within the Commission between its more moderate and radical members; the general conclusion is that with the sheer volume of work produced and the vast proportion of moderate to radical members, it is unlikely such strife existed.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} held oral {{hearings in}} Spring 2005 and received an unexpectedly {{large volume of}} written submissions with at least 60% being opposed to any constitutional changes to marriage or the family, including from members of Pro Life Campaign, Family Solidarity and Mother and Child Campaign. The final report, the Tenth interim report of the committee, was launched by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on 24 January 2006. It recommended no change to the constitutional definitions, as it expected such a referendum to fail. It suggested that there should instead be legislation for a civil partnership registration open to same-sex or opposite-sex couples which would confer succession, maintenance and taxation rights. Controversially, it also recommended that the 'presumed' recognition of cohabiting partners by the courts, as recommended by the <b>Law</b> <b>Reform</b> Commission, should also be legislated for, but only for opposite-sex couples. The basis for the limitation {{was that it would}} be easy for the courts to determine the validity of an opposite-sex relationship if there were children.|$|E
5|$|The Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 (c. 31) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} occupiers' liability. The {{result of the}} Third Report of the <b>Law</b> <b>Reform</b> Committee, the Act was {{introduced}} to Parliament as the Occupiers' Liability Bill and granted the Royal Assent on 6 June 1957, coming into force on 1 January 1958. The Act unified several classes of visitors to property and the duty of care owed {{to them by the}} occupier, as well as codifying elements of the common law relating to this duty of care. It also covered the duty owed to parties to a contract entering the property and ways of excluding the liability for visitors. The Act introduced an element of liability for landlords who failed to maintain their properties and were as a result responsible for the injury of a non-tenant, something counter to the previous common law rule in English law. The Act is still valid law, and forms much of the law relating to occupiers' liability in English law along with the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{rationale}} for land <b>law</b> <b>reforms</b> {{as well as their}} implications for different societal groups in Cameroon. It is revealed that the rationale - that is, to place as much land as possible in state hands - has remained unchanged since the colonial era. The study further shows that the land <b>law</b> <b>reforms</b> have always been skewed in favour of political and bureaucratic elites, entrepreneurs and the salariat at the expense of women in the informal sector, ethnic minorities and the poor. Thus, a potent consequence of land <b>law</b> <b>reforms</b> in Cameroon is that they have effectively accentuated socio-economic inequities characteristic of the country. To remedy these problems, it is recommended that authorities seek to create some fit between the 'modern' land tenure system and the traditions, culture and beliefs of the Cameroonian society. Additionally, it is recommended that serious efforts be made to institute programmes designed to redistribute income and improve the performance of the bureaucratic machinery, particularly the institutional framework for land policy administration.
