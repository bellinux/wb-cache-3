40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: At lumbar diskography, intradiskal {{lidocaine}} {{can eliminate}} or reduce provoked diskogenic pain. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the postdiskogram CT features of lidocaine-sensitive and lidocaine-insensitive severely painful disks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intradiskal lidocaine was injected at 182 severely painful levels in 111 patients. Clinical records/imaging studies were reviewed for response to intradiskal lidocaine (com-plete/substantial, partial, and no pain improvement), evidence of diskographic contrast leakage (fluo-roscopic/CT images), and the overall postdiskogram CT appearance in these severely painful disks. The assessed traditional Dallas grade (degeneration/radial tear [RT]) was supplemented by identified postdiskogram CT features of annular derangement (annular gap [AG], RT into peripheral annular tear [PAT], isolated PAT, <b>lamellar</b> annular <b>tear,</b> free/attached annular fragments, bucket-handle tear, and peripheral annular pocket). RESULTS: Isolated degenerative changes (40 %) and radial defects with or without degeneration (60 %) subsets were noted. Dallas grade 3 degeneration was most commonly observed (69 %) with increased features of annular derangement in disks with a worsening Dallas grade. Complete/substantial versus no pain improvement was significantly associated with disk state (diskographic leakage, contained) ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Lamellar</b> <b>tearing</b> {{is a type}} of welding defect {{that occurs}} in rolled steel plates that have been welded {{together}} due to shrinkage forces perpendicular to the faces of the plates. Since the 1970s, changes in manufacturing practices limiting the amount of sulfur used have greatly reduced the incidence of this problem.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lamellar</b> <b>tearing</b> {{is caused}} mainly by sulfurous {{inclusions}} in the material. Other causes include {{an excess of}} hydrogen in the alloy. This defect can be mitigated by keeping the amount of sulfur in the steel alloy below 0.005%. Adding rare earth elements, zirconium, or calcium to the alloy to control the configuration of sulfur inclusions throughout the metal lattice can also mitigate the problem.|$|E

50|$|A {{year later}} in March 1981, the investigative report {{concluded}} that the rig collapsed owing to a fatigue crack {{in one of its}} six bracings (bracing D-6), which connected the collapsed D-leg {{to the rest of the}} rig. This was traced to a small 6 mm fillet weld which joined a non-load-bearing flange plate to this D-6 bracing. This flange plate held a sonar device used during drilling operations. The poor profile of the fillet weld contributed to a reduction in its fatigue strength. Further, the investigation found considerable amounts of <b>lamellar</b> <b>tearing</b> in the flange plate and cold cracks in the butt weld. Cold cracks in the welds, increased stress concentrations due to the weakened flange plate, the poor weld profile, and cyclical stresses (which would be common in the North Sea), seemed to collectively play a role in the rig's collapse.|$|E
40|$|Authors {{establish}} {{the basis for}} a test suitable for plant use by unskilled personnel ABSTRACT. The lack of ductility through the thickness of steel plate has given rise to <b>lamellar</b> <b>tearing</b> in the plate, when it is subjected to weld shrinkage stresses in the thickness direction. Research in the last decade into <b>lamellar</b> <b>tearing</b> has led {{to a wide variety of}} tests, destructive and non-destructive. The latter has had such limited success that a suitable de-structive test has been sought. It is suggested that the slice bend test provides the most information for a given price. Six hundred tests on ten steels have shown the power of dis-crimination of the test and a correla-t ion w i th through-thickness tensile tests which have been used w i th some measure of success to assess the susceptibility of steels to <b>lamellar</b> <b>tearing.</b> In t roduct ion Nondestructive testing to assess ductility in the thickness direction has failed 1. 2 and although alternative procedures are being examined, de-signers and fabricators have to rely on destructive tests at the present t ime.

40|$|The rising {{demand for}} oil and gas has made it very {{necessary}} for the oil and gas industries to explore the offshore. There is a huge resources which is available in the offshore. The search {{for oil and gas}} is faced with greater challenges {{because of the nature of}} the marine environment as it poses difficult and harsh conditions for the construction of offshore structures. The major problem of the construction of offshore structure is the ability to produce a sound weld that gives the whole structure the structural integrity needed to withstand the harsh environmental conditions. This research work presents the performance of typical offshore steels with improved weldability. The ability of reducing the carbon content of thermo-mechanically rolled steels down to 0. 08 % makes it possible to achieve good weldability, toughness and strength for high strength steels used in offshore applications. Importantly, the ideal welding procedure should be strictly followed as recommended. The fabrication process is as important as the welding procedure in achieving a sound weld which is free of weld defects such as hydrogen induced cracking, <b>lamellar</b> <b>tearing</b> and solidification cracking. This research work also considers the corrosion as it affects offshore structure and necessary measures to mitigate the problem caused by corrosion...|$|E
40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Hoof lamellar pathology in horses with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) {{has not been}} described previously. Objectives: To describe the histomorphometry and pathological lesions in hoof lamellar tissue of animals that had PPID with or without concurrent laminitis, with reference to age-matched controls. We hypothesised that lamellar lesions consistent with laminitis {{would be associated with}} PPID, even in animals without current or historical laminitis. Study design: Prospective case–control study. Methods: Mid-dorsal hoof histological sections were obtained post mortem from the forelimbs of 16 PPID-affected animals either with (n = 6) or without laminitis (n = 10) and 10 age- and breed-matched controls. Sections were examined by a blinded veterinary pathologist. The length and width of 10 primary epidermal lamellae were measured using image analysis software. The morphology and pathology of primary and secondary epidermal lamellae were then typed or graded in axial, middle and abaxial regions. Fasting serum insulin, plasma adrenocorticotropin and blood glucose concentration were measured from blood samples taken prior to euthanasia. Results: All animals with PPID and laminitis had fasting hyperinsulinaemia (median 74. 1 miu/l, interquartile range 49. 9 – 349. 5 miu/l) whereas PPID animals without laminitis had serum insulin concentrations below the upper limit of the reference range (< 20 miu/l). Lamellar pathology in PPID animals with laminitis was variable in severity and unrelated to the reported duration of laminitis (range 2 months– 5 years). Most lesions were located abaxially within the lamellar tissue and included increased length and width of the lamellae, chronic abnormal keratinisation, interlamellar epidermal bridging and cell death with more acute <b>lamellar</b> <b>tearing</b> in some cases. The lamellae of PPID animals without laminitis were normal referent to the relevant control group. Conclusions: Whether PPID and hyperinsulinaemia have a causal inter-relationship or not, it may only be the hyperinsulinaemia that is associated with lamellar morphological alteration and pathology consistent with laminitis...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} anisotropies of two {{varieties of}} BS 4360 50 D steel were demonstrated for tensile, Charpy V impact and COD testing. The detrimental effect of sulphide inclusions for through thickness behaviour {{was related to}} the total inclusion length per unit area and the interaction of inclusions within the plastic zone. Sulphide inclusions in the through thickness orientation were found to increase crack tip constraints, reduce the plastic zone size and the post-yield load bearing capacity of the specimen ligament. This was achieved by the ease of movement of the growing crack tip to various planes containing suitable clusters of inclusions. COD at maximum load was shown to decrease exponentially with increasing inclusion content. For acceptable through thickness toughness it was shown necessary to limit the inclusion density to 1 to 1. 5 mm/mm 2, according to the constraints in its application. For plate or pipe material made from highly rolled steel, low sulphur steel melts must be used. Even rare-earth-modified steels will show unacceptable inclusion densities after high rolling strains in the mill. The inclusion density would increase both in the ZR and ZT through thickness directions. Notches along the rolling plane gave lower toughness levels due to inclusion interactions out-of-plane facilitated by the added length of the inclusion caused by hot rolling. A computer program was included which uses a polynomial fitting technique relating COD to inclusion density to predict through thickness toughness for any given inclusion content. A method was devised for through thickness testing of thin plate materials. Valid maximum load COD values were obtained by friction welding of extensions to undersized specimens. The effect of free surfaces that interacted with the plastic zone at the crack tip were found to be beneficial to crack tip deformations. For these reasons thin plates were shown to be unsusceptible to through thickness failures, such as, <b>lamellar</b> <b>tearing,</b> unless the effects of the free surface were removed by welding attachments to the surface. At upper shelf temperatures for ductile structural materials, it was shown that the measured toughness {{was related to the}} size of the plastic zone and, hence, to specimen geometry. The measured toughness related more to the absolute length of uncracked ligament rather than to crack length or crack length to width ratio. To -achieve geometry independence, the ligament length was required to be greater than the characteristic plastic zone size for the specimen thickness and testing temperature. The extensive plastic zone and the small highly strained zone sizes were shown to be dependent on temperature. At high temperatures the crack tip strains increased which resulted in crack blunting and stress dissipation. The work hardened material ahead of the crack tip showed evidence of small crack fissuring which led to stable crack growth. At low temperatures, where brittle fracture occurred, the highly strained region and extensive plastic zone were much smaller in size. Crack blunting was greatly reduced which allowed brittle fracture stresses to be achieved at the crack tip. At intermediate temperatures the crack tip blunting was extensive and it was shown that the amount of ductile cracking required to increase the constraint necessary to achieve brittle fracture decreased with decreasing temperature. Large specimen sizes resulted in high stored energy which, at transition temperatures, drove the ductile crack to catastrophic failures. This resulted in narrower transition regions which effectively shifted the transition to higher temperatures. The transition from ductile to brittle behaviour was considered, from the experimental evidence supplied, not to represent a shift in the state of stress. The through-thickness strain decrease associated with this transition was a result'of the associated decrease in COD. As the COD was shown to vary with specimen geometry independently of specimen thickness and, hence, independ- ently of the state of stress, then the associated change in through thickness strains were also not indicative of a change in the state of stress. A shift in the state of stress was considered to occur only when the through thickness strains varied with respect to COD. The method of load application was shown to have a significant effect on the measured toughness. Generally yielded specimens were shown to be under greater crack tip constraints when the specimen was loaded in bending rather then in tension...|$|E
