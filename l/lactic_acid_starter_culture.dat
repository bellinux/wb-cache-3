Thirty-four isolates inhibited {{the growth of}} L. monocytogenes. Ten strains, which produced the biggest zones of inhibition, were characterized. One strain, isolate 80, which exhibited the strongest inhibition against L. monocytogenes, was selected for subsequent in-depth analysis. Both ribotyping and DNA sequencing of 16 S ribosomal RNA demonstrated that the isolate was Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. Primary characterization showed that the anti-L. monocytogenes compound was proteinaceous and the antimicrobial effects were not caused by pH, a phage or H 2 O 2, indicating {{that it was a}} bacteriocin. A plasmid cured derivative of isolate 32 was obtained. This plasmid-free strain still produced a bacteriocin, and had the same antibiotic resistance pattern as the wild type strain, indicating that the antibiotic resistance and bacteriocin genes were most likely to be chromosomally mediated.

40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the {{microbiology}} of the Lebanon bologna process were studied. Manufacture of Lebanon bologna appeared {{to be similar to}} that of summer sausage and other fermented sausages and consisted of a lactic acid fermentation by lactobacilli accompanied by the production of cured meat color from the reduction of nitrate by micrococci. The traditional process consists of aging coarse ground beef at 5 C for several days. Aging the beef for about 10 days was necessary to allow development of lactic acid bacteria; for successful fermentation, the concentration of lactic acid producers must be 104 /g or more. At least 3 % NaCl was necessary to suppress the development of pseudomonads during the aging period; higher concentrations of salt suppress the development of the lactic acid-producing flora. During aging, in the presence of salt, the predominant flora developing on the meat consisted of catalase-positive, gram-positive rods and cocci; during fermentation at 35 C, the predominant flora became catalase-negative, gram-positive rods with characteristics of lactobacilli. Lebanon bologna could be made from frozen beef if the meat was thawed, salted, and aged.

40|$|Protein energy {{malnutrition}} (PEM) is {{the most}} serious nutritional problem affecting pre-school children in developing countries. The low energy and nutrient density of the diet and the presence of anti-nutritional factors contribute to this condition, as do the low frequency of feeding and transmission of diarrhoea-causing pathogens via the food. The overall objective of this thesis was to evaluate the use of lactic acid fermentation in order to improve the nutritional quality and microbiological safety of cereal weaning foods. The study focused on Tanzanian cereal staple foods, and the nutritional factors specifically studied included dietary bulk properties, in vitro protein digestibility and in vitro estimation of iron availability. The microbiological study evaluated the survival of diarrhoea-causing pathogens in lactic acid-fermented gruels. A prospective epidemiological study was carried out to evaluate the effect of regular consumption of lactic acid-fermented gruels on the diarrhoea prevalence in pre-school children living in a rural setting of Tanzania. With a fermentation technique using a natural <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> and addition of flour of germinated seeds, it was possible to prepare liquid cereal gruels from maize, white sorghum, bulrush millet and finger millet with a 30 to 35 % flour concentration. The energy density of such a lactic acid-fermented gruel was about 1. 2 kcal/g, as compared with 0. 4 kcal/g in a non-fermented gruel prepared to the same consistency. This represents a threefold increase in energy density. Fermentation of high-tannin sorghum gruels only resulted in a double increase of the energy density while maintaining a liquid consistency. The in vitro protein digestibility of high-tannin cereal varieties was significantly (p Lactic acid fermentation of non-tannin cereals with added fluor of germinated sorghum grain or wheat phytase increased the iron solubility from about 4 % to 9 % and 50 %, respectively. Soaking the flour in water before fermentation had a similar effect as addition of wheat phytase. The increase in soluble iron was strongly related to enzymatic degradation of phytate (p Lactic acid-fermented gruels inhibited the proliferation of inoculated Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella flexneri and Salmonella typhimurium as well as Gram-positive bacteria.

In this review we will discuss recent advances in tracking the adaptation of phages to the dairy industry, the advances in understanding LAB phage-host interactions, including evolutionary and genomic aspects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract For {{studying}} the microbiota of four Danish surface-ripened cheeses produced at three farmhouses and one industrial dairy, both a culture-dependent and culture-independent approach were used. After dereplication {{of the initial}} set of 433 isolates by (GTG) 5 -PCR fingerprinting, 217 bacterial and 25 yeast isolates were identified by se-quencing of the 16 S rRNA gene or the D 1 /D 2 domain of the 26 S rRNA gene, respectively. At the end of ripening, the cheese core microbiota of the farmhouse cheeses consisted of the mesophilic <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> bacteria (LAB) <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Leuconostoc mesen-teorides as well as non-starter LAB including different Lactobacillus spp. The cheese from the industrial dairy was almost exclusively dominated by Lb. paracasei. The surface bacterial microbiota of all four cheeses were domi-nated by Corynebacterium spp. and/or Brachybacterium spp. Brevibacterium spp. {{was found to be}} subdominant compared to other bacteria on the farmhouse cheeses, and no Brevibacterium spp. was found on the cheese from the industrial dairy, even though B. linens was used as surface-ripening culture. Moreover, Gram-negative bacteria identi-fied as Alcalignes faecalis and Proteus vulgaris were found on one of the farmhouse cheeses. The surface yeast micro-biota consisted primarily of one dominating species for each cheese. For the farmhouse cheeses, the dominant yeast species were Yarrowia lipolytica, Geotrichum spp. and Debaryomyces hansenii, respectively, and for the cheese from the industrial dairy, D. hansenii was the dominant yeast species. Additionally, denaturing gradient gel electro-phoresis (DGGE) analysis revealed that Streptococcus thermophilus was present in the farmhouse raw milk cheese analysed in this study. Furthermore, DGGE bands corresponding to Vagococcus carniphilus, Psychrobacter spp. and Lb. curvatus on the cheese surfaces indicated that these bacterial species {{may play a role in}} cheese ripening...|$|R

Adding S. aureus (initial count log 6. 64 / ml) with LAB (initial count log 6. 8 / ml) in milk during yoghurt processing and storage resulted in {{no significant change}} in the counts of both S. aureus and LAB during fermentation period of 4 hrs at 45 ° C. A steady decrease in S. aureus count during storage at 25 ° C and 4 ° C was observed reaching a complete (100 %) inhibition after 9 and 12 days, respectively, with no significant increase in LAB count. Adding S. aureus (initial count log 6. 62 / ml) with B. lactis (initial count log 6. 83 / ml) in milk for 4 hr at 45 ° C, no significant changes in the counts of both bacteria were found. After storage at 25 ° C and at 4 ° C a sharp decline in the S. aureus count with a 100 % inhibition after 6 and 9 days with approximately two log and one log increase in B. lactis counts consecutively. In general similar result was observed when adding S. aureus together with LAB and B. lactis in milk during fermentation and storage. pH values decreased during milk fermentation and storage from initially 6. 55 - 6. 64 to around 4 in most milk samples. The results of this study show that S. aureus was completely inhibited by LAB and/or B. lactis after milk fermentation to yoghurt and storage at room temperature and refrigeration for 6 - 9 days. It is therefore recommended to add the probiotic B. lactis with LAB to milk for yoghurt processing...|$|R
40|$|In Namibia, Omashikwa {{traditional}} fermented buttermilk {{made with}} the root of Omunkunzi (Boscia albitrunca) tree by local farmers {{is one of the}} most important rural food products. It provides nutrition, jobs and generates income for food security for the community. As a traditional fermented product, it is unusual as it has a viscous consistency and low syneresis. However, the quality of Omashikwa is inconsistent and is characterized by high acid taste, low pH, rancid flavour, root taste and smell and contains filth. In this research, the production process of Omashikwa, physico-chemical properties of the traditional and laboratory prepared Omashikwa and the role of the root of B. albitrunca tree in Omashikwa, viscosity, syneresis, microbiology and sensory properties were studied and compared in order to improve the quality of Omashikwa for wider community use and for poverty alleviation. Omashikwa was found to have a protein content of about 3. 3 %, fat 1. 6 %, moisture 90 %, lactose 4. 6 %, ash 0. 7 %, total solids 8. 7 %, <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> 0. 9 % and a pH of 3. 3 The quality of traditionally processed Omashikwa (TO) was compared with the laboratory processed Omashikwa (LO), which was made without the root. Traditional fermentation was carried out with raw milk and under rural conditions. After fermentation the milk was agitated vigorously to churn into butter, whereas LO was made with pasteurized (65 ºC/ 30 min) and filtered milk, and cream was scooped off after fermentation instead of churning. LO had a significantly (p < 0. 05) higher pH (4. 44) compared to traditional Omashikwa (pH 3. 25), lower acidity (0. 68 %) compared to 0. 92 % of TO. Fat content was higher in LO (2. 44 % fat) compared to 1. 56 % fat in TO. LO was free from filth and had higher viscosity (2. 98 Pa. s) compared to 2. 54 Pa. s and lower syneresis (14. 4 ml/ 24 ml) compared to 19. 6 ml/ 24 ml of TO. It was found that extract from B. albitrunca root showed a low pH of 4. 7 and exhibited bacterial inhibition properties on Total Plate Count Agar ring test. The root appear to specifically inhibit Escherichi coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium species. It also had a high content of soluble carbohydrates (hydrocolloids or gum) (19. 4 %). Significant difference (p < 0. 05) in total aerobic counts was observed in TO of 6. 62 log cfu/g compared to 8. 62 log cfu/g of LO and lower <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> bacterial counts, 6. 58 log cfu/g compared to 7. 87 log cfu/g of LO. Probably the most affected microorganisms in TO were the non acid formers, as lower pH of TO and inhibitory compounds in Omunkunzi root could have reduced them. Coliforms, yeasts and moulds counts were not significantly different (p< 0. 05). No pathogenic bacteria were found in either product. The <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> bacteria identified belonged to the genera Lactobacillus (Lb.) (Weissella), Leuconostoc (Leuc.), Lactococus (Lact.) and Streptococcus (Str.) Twenty representative strains of LAB isolates were identified to species level; three belonged to the species Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and two belonged to Lb. plantarum and two to Weissella confusa (former Lb. confuses). Three belonged to Str. salivarius thermophilus, three to Leuc. lactis, and two to Leuc. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides. Three belonged to Lact. lactis subsp. lactis and two belonged to Lact. lactis subsp. cremoris. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) in descriptive and consumer sensory attributes scores were observed between traditional and laboratory Omashikwa. Sensory attributes scores of TO on the levels of syneresis was 3. 4 compared to 2. 9 for LO, filth 3. 0 compared to 1. 8 in LO, rancidity scores were 3. 4 in TO compared to 1. 8 in LO, and bitterness 4. 2 in TO compared to 2. 5 in LO. Aroma scores were 2. 6 for TO and 4. 2 for LO, viscosity 2. 5 (TO) and 3. 8 (LO) and texture 2. 7 for TO compared to 4. 2 for LO. There was an 80 % preference score given to the laboratory Omashikwa by the young consumer panelists. The results of this study indicate justification of using B. albitrunca root in the processing of Omashiwa by the rural community to improve the quality of Omashikwa in terms of flavour, smell and consistency compared to other traditional fermented milk products and in the absence of modern technology. However, application of good manufacturing practices on unit operations, particularly heat treatment of milk prior to fermentation, use of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>starter</b> <b>cultures,</b> maintenance of good hygiene and sanitation including packaging, seem to be the effective methods to improve and sustain the quality and safety of traditional fermented buttermilk (Omashikwa) for a wider market and better price. Namibia Dairies Ltd, just like any other dairies in the region and elsewhere, manufactures buttermilk, a byproduct of butter that is fermented with mesophilic <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> cultures and branded as Omashikwa for the purpose of marketing. It has nothing to do with traditional Omashikwa as such; B. albitrunca root is not added and is processed by using modern industrial method. In addition, additives such as preservatives (potassium sorbate), stabilizers (pectin) and sugar are added and packed for distribution. This research project therefore investigated the processing technology, physico-chemical, microbiological, viscosity and sensory quality of traditional Omashikwa. The remedial measures to curb inconsistency and poor quality experienced in Omashikwa processed in Namibia were also investigated and scientific measures were proposed for production of quality Omashikwa for marketing to a wider community. Since laboratory processing method of Omashikwa gave a better quality product compared to traditional method in terms of microbiological quality, sensory attributes, viscosity, filth content, syneresis and general appearance, laboratory processing technique of processing Omashikwa is therefore recommended as an alternative and appropriate processing method for small scale production in the rural set up to improve the quality of Omashikwa.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the effect of ultra High Hydrostatic pressure (HHP) combined with temperature on the activity of proteolytic enzymes used in food technology. A kinetic analysis was conducted for each proteolytic enzyme and from the obtained results the optimum conditions for the controlled activation/inactivation were selected for each enzyme. The proteolytic enzymes and the selected HHP conditions were applied to the production process of dairy products. The effect of HHP (200 - 900 MPa combined with 40 - 80 °C) on the activity of plant cystein proteases such as actinidin, ficin and papain was studied. Papain and ficin are highly pressure and temperature resistant enzymes. Actinidin appeared to be significantly more pressure and temperature sensitive, compared to papain and ficin. For all cystein proteases, a multi-parameter equation was developed to describe the effect of pressure and temperature on their inactivation rate constant. Actinidin was selected and used as milk clotting agent {{for the production of}} a “novel” dairy product, since it was the only enzyme, whose application did not cause a bitter taste to the end product. HHP could be practically used for controlling the proteolytic activity in the final product in order to avoid uncontrolled hydrolysis that leads to protein fragments and peptides of undesirable functional and sensory properties. Studies of milk coagulation using plant proteases as clotting agents, in combination with subsequent controlled inactivation with HHP have not been previously reported. The effect of the dairy substrate and the process parameters on the coagulation rate and the texture and sensory properties of the end product, were studied. Selected values of design parameters were 25 % total solids, 6. 49 adjusted pH, 0. 35 U activity of the clotting agent actinidin, 40 ?C process temperature and 2 h time. These values were selected based on organoleptic acceptance of the products and minimum time for coagulation. The selected pressure-temperature conditions, 600 MPa at 40 ?C, were applied to stop the potentially detrimental further proteolytic action of the enzyme. Results indicated that use of actinidin for milk clotting and HHP to stop the enzyme activity in the final product leads to a “fresh cheese” type dairy product. Similar kinetic analysis to the one described for cystein proteases was also conducted for aminopeptidases from <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> bacteria <b>starter</b> <b>cultures.</b> These enzymes play a significant role to cheese maturation and {{contribute to the development of}} their sensory characteristics. The aim of this work was to use HHP as aminopeptidases activity regulator and increase their activity. Five aminopeptidases (PepX, PepN, PepC, PepA and PepY), from the <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> L. bulgaricus, L. lactis and Str. Thermophillus, were studied. Pressures (100 - 700 MPa) combined with temperature (20 - 40 °C) were used for the control of their activity. Activation occurred after treatment at low pressures (not higher than 300 MPa) and low temperature (20 °C). Treatment at 200 MPa and 20 °C were the process conditions selected for activation of all enzymes from all microorganisms. These selected conditions were applied to the production process of a brine cheese (feta). Immature cheeses were treated at 200 and 500 vMPa and 20 °C. In addition, cheese was produced with the use of HHP treated (200 MPa and 20 °C) <b>starter</b> <b>culture.</b> The proteolysis progress of all cheeses during maturation was recorded. A high conciseness of small peptides and amino-acids was found for cheeses produced with the use of HHP treated culture. These peptides and amino-acids are correlated with the development of the sensory and flavor characteristics of the cheeses. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the technological characteristics of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> bacteria used as <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>starter</b> in the manufacturing of fermented dairy products and which are suitable to local conditions. Morphological, cultural, physiological and biochemical characteristics were employed to identify <b>Lactic</b> <b>Acid</b> Bacteria (LAB), isolated from drinking yoghurt in different areas in Khartoum state, Sudan. The purification of isolates was done by transferring Gram +ve rods and cocci shaped bacteria to the plates of selective media MRS and M- 17, respectively. These isolates were further sub cultured until pure isolates were obtained. From 18 drinking yoghurt samples a total of 303 LAB positives were determined, in which 47 (17. 38 %) and 256 (82. 62 %) were identified as <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> cocci and <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> bacilli, respectively. Additionally, our biochemical tests showed the occurrence of 22 (44. 44 %) Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and 25 (55. 56 %) Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris among <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> cocci. While, in the case of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> bacilli, Lactobacillus helveticus 35 (15. 3 %); Lactobacillus plantarum 74 (22. 3 %); Lactobacillus brevis 17 (21 %); Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei 36 (15. 5 %) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 94 (25. 9 %) was found.

40|$|Abstract- Thermophilic <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>starters,</b> Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, were {{produced}} by controlled mixed cultures. The total bacterial concentration {{and the population}} ratio {{at the end of}} fermentation were fixed by the operating conditions (pH and temperature) and by the initial percentage of S. thermophilus in the inoculum. The suitability of these mixed starters for yoghurt manufacture was determined from their aci-dification activity. This was not significantly different from that obtained with equivalent mixing of pure cultures. During preservation, the rnixed starters were slightly less resistant, both in fro-zen and freeze-dried forms, than starters obtained from pure cultures. The productivity of the mixed cultures was twice from that obtained with the traditional starter production process, whatever the final population ratio. Finally, the ability to control the mixed starter èultures, the increased pro-ductivity and their properties (acidification and preservation) proved their interest for industrial applications. © InralElsevier, Paris. therrnophilic <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> bacteria / mixed <b>culture</b> / <b>starter</b> production * Correspondence and reprints Résumé- Production de levains lactiques thermophiles en cultures mixtes.

The majority of samples showed reduction higher than 10 %, although only 65 % were phage positive. The isolated phages were quite stable and showed no reduction in infectivity even after 20 daily replications. A pool of bacteriophages was prepared from isolates and inoculated in 12 commercial lactic starters. After 8 hours of incubation, only 2 showed reduced acidification.
