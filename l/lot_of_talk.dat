Angrily, Frank {{said he would not}} drink, and he and Billy left the saloon immediately to seek Tom. By law, both Frank and Billy should have left their firearms at the Grand Hotel.

[...] He {{spoke out against}} Obama, saying things like, [...] "Obama would make the world suffer." [...] His anti-racist sister Kayla, who is two years younger than Paul, often argued with him about his racial beliefs. A few days before his arrest, a neighbor said he heard semiautomatic gunfire coming from an open field behind Schlesselman's house. After his arrest, Schlesselman's family expressed doubt that he seriously intended {{to carry out the}} plot; his father, Mike, said, [...] "I think it's just a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk.</b> He would never do something like this." [...] Kayla said she spoke with her brother after the charges were made public, and that Paul [...] "said he's sorry about everything he's done." ...|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{enjoyed the}} process of making the film: [...] "The TV {{schedule}} is tight, and you don't always {{have a lot of time}} to work on your drawings." [...] He appreciated the film's hand-drawn animation: [...] "I think the movie's drawings are much superior than the TV show", although CGI animation was flourishing at the time of the film's release. [...] "There's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> about 2-D being dead, and I hope people don't think that. Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree with me that it's all about what you're trying to say. There are many ways to tell a story, and what's unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story." [...] The clay animation scenes were shot by Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan at Screen Novelties in Los Angeles.|$|E

5000|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 4 out of 4 stars, noting [...] "Viewers raised on trained and tame movies may be uncomfortable {{in the world}} of Cassavetes; his films are built around <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> and the waving of arms and the invoking of the gods... Sometimes (as in Husbands) the wild truth-telling {{approach}} evaporates into a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> empty <b>talk</b> and play-acting. In Love Streams, it works." ...|$|R

500|$|The Oilers {{were led}} by Wayne Gretzky, who {{remained}} with the Oilers when they joined the NHL in 1979. [...] At [...] and , some observers doubted that Gretzky could match his offensive performance from his lone WHA season. [...] "I heard a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> then that I'd never get 110 points like I did in the WHA," [...] said Gretzky. He proved his critics wrong, scoring 137 points in 1979–80 and winning the first of nine Hart Trophies (including 8 consecutive awards from 1980–1988) as the NHL's most valuable player.

The firing came hours after a team meeting in which Boros told the players that he would not change his personality. First baseman Bruce Bochte said, [...] "Steve indicated there was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> going around, that his situation wasn't stable. He {{said he was going to}} go ahead and be the kind of manager he had been, that he wasn't going to change to keep his job." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's {{thematic}} content, Daniel Rossen noted, [...] "There's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> about negotiating {{distance from}} people in your life. We were dealing with that in various forms, learning {{what it means to}} be alone, learning {{what it means to be}} close to somebody, certain things coming to a head. It just feels like a major difficulty in life." [...] Droste elaborated, [...] "There's a desire to be autonomous, but there's also this great fear of being alone, and there's this constant feeling of, 'How do you reconcile this?' There's this need for space, but there's also this, 'Come closer come closer.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|... "The {{level of}} preposterous {{is just too}} high, {{and the level of}} fun and {{excitement}} far too low.

It could also just be like an ironic statement. I don't know, I just like the sound of it." [...] Rose also mentioned the album would feature [...] "lot of different sounds. There's some heavy songs, there's a lot of aggressive songs, but they're all in different styles and different sounds. It is truly a melting pot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Donegal's defence {{of their}} All-Ireland title began against Tyrone on 26 May 2013. The match was billed in advance as the toughest contest Donegal would face in Ulster, with the winner thought {{likely to become}} Ulster champions. Donegal brushed aside Tyrone with {{relative}} ease. McGuinness said afterwards: [...] "In {{the last two years}} the exact same thing was said. The only difference this year was that we were relegated [...] There was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> about putting all the eggs into one basket, but it was the same last year and the same the year before. That's what we do – it's championship football. It will be no different next year. It was a media spin that got the whole debate going. Next year we will put all our eggs in that basket again." ...|$|E

Edele {{admitted}} that [...] "The biggest anxiety about doing this - there's only one, and that's Sinéad." [...] She admitted that she and Sinéad had fallen out in 2006 and had not spoken to each other since. Lindsay also said: [...] "Some of the issues we didn't even know were necessarily there until we were faced with this opportunity {{that we have to}} work together again, then we were like, 'Oh, OK, {{in order for us to}} do this then we have to sort a few things out.' It all just came up. It's been difficult to get to this point. There's been a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking,</b> a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking.</b> But we're here now.

2500|$|Before {{the opening}} tip, Bryant and O'Neal did not talk, but did greet {{each other by}} bumping forearms. During the game, Bryant was fouled by O'Neal several times but the {{contacts}} were not excessive. O'Neal fouled out late {{in the fourth quarter}} but the Heat still won the game in overtime, led by up-and-coming star, Dwyane Wade. Bryant missed a potentially game-winning shot as time expired. When asked about the brick wall comment, Bryant said, [...] "I knew there was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> about the brick wall and all that. But I think that was kind of just to hype the game. Hopefully, this is all behind us now." [...] O'Neal shared a similar tone, saying [...] "I'm over it. It's old news to me." [...] Bryant and O'Neal met on the court twice more during the season, once during the NBA All-Star Game and once more when the Lakers played the Heat on March 17, 2005.|$|E

She said: [...] "There is a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> about our government not being clean, but from our experience the situation was very much worse when [...] parties were forming governments". And she dismissed criticism of the way her Congress Party raised election campaign money, saying all parties used the same methods. The prime minister retained the support of her party, which issued a statement backing her. After news of the verdict spread, hundreds of supporters demonstrated outside her house, pledging their loyalty. Indian High Commissioner BK Nehru said Gandhi's conviction would not harm her political career. [...] "Mrs Gandhi has still today overwhelming support in the country," [...] he said. [...] "I believe {{the prime minister of}} India will continue in office until the electorate of India decides otherwise".|$|E
