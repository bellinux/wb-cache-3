25|$|The {{earliest}} settlers to {{the district}} arrived in the 1840s, and farmed the area with wheat and sheep predominantly. The town soon grew into an important grain storage and <b>loading</b> <b>point,</b> with a jetty constructed in 1874, only the second to be built on the Eyre Peninsula. This provided a much needed outlet for the copper ore which {{was coming from the}} Burrowing Mine. The original jetty was taken down in 1999 due to safety concerns, but the other newer jetty is still in use.|$|E
25|$|Between Moor Park and Croxley, a short branch ran {{south-east}} off the Watford branch {{near its}} junction {{with the main}} line to Croxley Tip, a rubbish dump beside the Grand Union Canal. This site began as a gravel <b>loading</b> <b>point</b> before becoming used by the railway to dump waste such as old ballast and waste from Neasden power station. This route, never used for passenger traffic, continued {{to be used by}} London Transport's small fleet of steam engines until 1971, when diesels replaced them. The branch closed some time after this, although a section of the spur line remained visible from a passing train.|$|E

25|$|The Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine railway, a rare 13 mile (21km) {{extension}} to the network, {{to the north}} of the Firth of Forth in Scotland. A Bill for the railway was passed by the Scottish Parliament and received Royal Assent in August 2004. Work commenced in September 2005, with services running by early 2008. The line re-establishes a railway decommissioned in 1983; the new line provided passenger connections to Glasgow, and freight links between the site of Kincardine power station, now used as a <b>loading</b> <b>point</b> for coal from open-cast sites, to avoid heavy traffic through Kincardine, and Longannet power station, and the coal terminals at Hunterston Deep Water Port. Longannet power station closed in 2016. The passenger part of the scheme, from Stirling to Alloa was in any case secure, and the Scottish Parliament appear to be in favour of passenger services being extended to Rosyth. This could possibly result in passenger stations serving the communities of Clackmannan, Kincardine, and Culross or Valleyfield, and through trains once more from Stirling to Dunfermline.|$|E
500|$|The modern town of Blyth {{began to}} develop {{in the first quarter}} of the 18th century. [...] Up until 1716, the land around the Blyth area—the Newsham Estate—was owned by the Earls of Derwentwater, but when the third Earl, James Radclyffe, was {{executed}} for his part in the Jacobite rising of 1715, the land was forfeited to the crown. [...] On 11 July 1723, the Lordship of Newsham was put up for sale by the Commissioners of Forfeited Estates at their office in the Inner Temple, London. [...] The land was bought by Matthew White and his brother-in-law Richard Ridley. [...] From the 12th century, most port activities were on the north side of the river, but under White and Ridley the first new quays and houses were built on the south side, and from here the port began to prosper. [...] By 1730, a coaling quay, a ballast quay, a pilots' watch house and a lighthouse had all been built at Blyth harbour. [...] In 1765 the first breakwater was constructed, and in 1788 the first staith with an elevated <b>loading</b> <b>point</b> was erected. [...] Deep mines were sunk at Cowpen Colliery and Cowpen Square in 1796 and 1804 respectively, and by 1855, a quarter of a million tons of coal was being shipped from Blyth, rising to three million tons by 1900. [...] The only industry not to survive during this prosperous time was the salt trade, which was heavily taxed during the 18th and early-19th centuries. [...] During the Napoleonic Wars, the tax was increased to provide funds for the military and, even though the tax was abolished in 1825, the industry went into terminal decline. [...] Having had fourteen salt pans at the beginning of the 18th century, exporting over 1,000tons of salt annually, Blyth's salt industry closed in 1876, with the destruction of the last salt pan.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} years of the line, timber was the {{dominant}} traffic from Ross, and in the 1920s, there was some pressure to operate NZR rolling stock on the Stuart and Chapman Ltd tramway, but this came to nothing and the tramway used private rolling stock until its closure in 1959. [...] As the forests were felled, they were not replaced, and agriculture grew in importance, with agricultural lime and fertiliser railed in and livestock railed out; Ross served as the <b>loading</b> <b>point</b> for cattle driven up from southern Westland. [...] By the 1970s, the line beyond Hokitika was operating uneconomically, and closure came in 1980. [...] The combined road/rail bridge south of Hokitika, known as the [...] "longest xylophone in the world" [...] in New Zealand railfan jargon due to the rattling its planks made, required urgent repairs but it was decided that the cost outweighed the benefits due to the insignificance of the line. [...] Road traffic was diverted to another bridge upstream and the line from Hokitika to Ross closed on 24 November 1980. [...] This made the closure of the Ross section somewhat remarkable as its passenger service had ceased only eight years earlier; most rural New Zealand branches lost their passenger service at least two or three decades before the entire line was closed.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} with both EGR and Wetpac technologies is that NOx reduction is lower at low loads, i.e. an increased EGR rate or water volume is needed at low loads to reach the cycle average. Another challenge is the increased need for engine flexibility, since NOx reduction is different at different loads and because fuel consumption should always be minimized in the most important operating areas. Changes in inlet valve timing (VIC) and fuel injection parameters (Common Rail or corresponding system) are needed for this, and could be used to optimize the different <b>load</b> <b>points</b> so that the 50 and 75  % <b>load</b> <b>points</b> are on the cycle limit value to get the best fuel consumption, whilst the 25  % <b>load</b> <b>point</b> NOx is on the maximum accepted, i.e. 1.5 *cycle average, and the 100  % <b>load</b> <b>point</b> where SFOC is not important, should have NOx as low as necessary to reach the cycle value.|$|R

40|$|Reliability cost/worth {{assessment}} {{is becoming an}} important aspect of power system planning and operation as it provides an opportunity to compare the worth of electric service reliability with the cost of providing that reliability, The interruption costs incurred by the customers (CIC) due to power supply interruptions can be used as surrogates in the reliability worth assessment of an electric power system. In order to determine an optimal and reasonable level of customer service, reliability cost/worth can be performed by calculating the costs associated with different system configurations and assessing the corresponding reliability worth.. The main objective of this research was to examine the. ability to perform reliability worth assessment by applying appropriate customer damage functions (CDF) at different <b>load</b> <b>points</b> in a distribution system. The reliability worth assessment was performed by linking distribution system predictive reliability indices with the customer interruption costs associated With power supply interruptions at the various <b>load</b> <b>points.</b> This thesis is concerned with the sensitivity analysis of the expected customer outage cost (ECOST) using both <b>load</b> <b>point</b> customer damage functions (LPCDF) and sector customer damage functions (SCDF). This thesis also illustrates the impact on the ECOST of selected distribution system parameters using both LPCDF and SCDF. Customer damage functions utilized in the evaluation of ECOST can vary substantially due to the composition of the customers at the different <b>load</b> <b>points</b> in the system. Thel. sensitivity studies show that the ECOST is highly dependent on the actual customer composition. This thesis also illustrates the application of relevant customer damage functions to evaluate the ECOST on an actual distribution system feeder located in the City of Saskatoon. The evaluated ECOST using representative <b>load</b> <b>point</b> customer damage functions at each individual <b>load</b> <b>point</b> provides the most realistic estimate of the expected customer cost This thesis illustrates that <b>load</b> <b>point</b> customer damage functions are important parameters in the evaluation of the ECOST in an actual distribution system...|$|R
