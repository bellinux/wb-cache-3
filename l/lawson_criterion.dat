25|$|The <b>Lawson</b> <b>Criterion</b> {{shows how}} energy output varies with temperature, density, speed of collision, and fuel. This {{equation}} {{was central to}} John Lawson's analysis of fusion working with a hot plasma. Lawson assumed an energy balance, shown below.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{stabilising}} {{force was}} lower than the force available in the pinch, it lasted considerably longer. It appeared that a reactor could be built that would approach the <b>Lawson</b> <b>criterion</b> from a different direction; through extended confinement times rather than increased density. This {{was similar to the}} stellarator approach in concept, and although it would have lower field strength than those machines, the energy needed to maintain the confinement was much lower. Today this approach is known as the reversed field pinch (RFP) and has been a field of continued study.|$|E
40|$|This {{proposed}} {{design for}} a mini thermonuclear reactor uses a method based upon a series of important innovations. A cumulative explosion presses a capsule with nuclear fuel up to 100 thousands of atmospheres, the explosive electric generator heats the capsule/pellet up to 100 million degrees and a special capsule and a special cover which keeps these pressure and temperature in capsule up to 0. 001 sec. which is sufficient for <b>Lawson</b> <b>criteria</b> for ignition of thermonuclear fuel. Major advantages of these reactors/bombs is its very low cost, dimension, weight and easy production, which {{does not require a}} complex industry. The mini thermonuclear bomb can be delivered as a shell by conventional gun (from 155 mm), small civil aircraft, boat or even by an individual. The same method may be used for thermonuclear engine for electric energy plants, ships, aircrafts, tracks and rockets.

However, integration towards a global psychology, or other overarching cross-cultural framework of psychological phenomena transcendent of specific cultural ontologies may require the inclusion of paradigms and methodologies that exist apart from traditional western-scientific understandings of rigor. Moreover, diagnostic criteria will remain an important point of conversation and controversy for global psychology, as it jeopardizes the basic ability of researchers to generalize and categorize the prevalence/incidence of mental illness in a global context (Poznyak, Reed, & Clark, 2011).|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} proper wind comfort {{criterion}} {{is considered to}} be crucial to reliable assessment of pedestrian level wind comfort. This paper aims to propose a wind comfort criterion that can be applied to Hong Kong, in which the wind comfort is seriously deteriorated by the moderated airflow, particularly in the hot and humid summer. By thoroughly reviewing and comparing exiting wind comfort criteria, the parameters in <b>Lawson</b> (1978) <b>criterion</b> are adopted for acceptable, tolerable and intolerable category and the parameters in NEN 8100 (2006) criterion are adopted for danger category in the proposed criteria. Besides, a low wind parameter suggested by AVA scheme (2005) is adopted for unfavourable category in summer criterion. The adopted parameters provide scientific foundations and they are carefully chosen to adapt the weak wind conditions. The prominent features of the criteria are proposed seasonally (summer and winter, respectively) and the overall mean wind velocity ratio (OMVR) is used as threshold wind velocity parameter. The wind tunnel tests of Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPolyU) campus model were used as a case study. The results show that the proposed criteria can reasonably represent the weak wind condition and provide suitable assessments of the wind comfort in Hong Kong. Moreover, the findings in this study provide scientific basis for future policy-making and the proposed criteria can also help city planners to improve the pedestrian level wind comfort.

25|$|In {{conventional}} reactor designs, whether {{based on}} magnetic or inertial confinement, the bremsstrahlung can easily escape the plasma {{and is considered}} a pure energy loss term. The outlook would be more favorable if the plasma could reabsorb the radiation. Absorption occurs primarily via Thomson scattering on the electrons, which has a total cross section of σT = 6.65×10−29 m². In a 50–50 D-T mixture this corresponds {{to a range of}} 6.3 g/cm²./σT = 2.5×(1.67×10−24 g)/(6.65×10−25 cm²) = 6.28 g/cm² This is considerably higher than the <b>Lawson</b> <b>criterion</b> of ρR > 1g/cm², which is already difficult to attain, but might be achievable in inertial confinement systems.|$|E
25|$|The peak {{reaction}} rate of p–11B {{is only one}} third that for D-T, requiring better plasma confinement. Confinement is usually characterized by the time τ the energy must be retained so that the fusion power released exceeds the power required to heat the plasma. Various requirements can be derived, most commonly {{the product of the}} density, nτ, and the product with the pressure nTτ, both of which are called the <b>Lawson</b> <b>criterion.</b> The nτ required for p–11B is 45 times higher than that for D-T. The nTτ required is 500 times higher.B would be a factor of three smaller, as calculated here. (See also neutronicity, confinement requirement, and power density.) Since the confinement properties of conventional fusion approaches, such as the tokamak and laser pellet fusion are marginal, most aneutronic proposals use radically different confinement concepts.|$|E

2500|$|The {{significance}} of [...] {{as a function}} of temperature in a device with a particular energy confinement time is found by considering the <b>Lawson</b> <b>criterion.</b> [...] This is an extremely challenging barrier to overcome on Earth, which explains why fusion research has taken many years to reach the current advanced technical state.|$|E
2500|$|However, the <b>Lawson</b> <b>criterion</b> {{does not}} apply for Polywells if Bussard's {{conjecture}} that the plasma is nonthermal is correct. Lawson stated in his founding report: [...] "It is of course easy to postulate systems in which the velocity distribution of the particle is not Maxwellian. These systems are {{outside the scope of}} this report." [...] He also ruled out the possibility of a nonthermal plasma to ignite: [...] "Nothing may be gained by using a system in which electrons are at a lower temperature [...] The energy loss in such a system by transfer to the electrons will always be greater than the energy which would be radiated by the electrons if they were the [...] temperature." ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Lawson</b> <b>criterion</b> {{argues that}} a machine holding a thermalized and quasi-neutral plasma has to meet basic {{criteria}} to overcome radiation losses, conduction losses and reach efficiency of 30 percent. This {{became known as the}} [...] "triple product": the plasma density, temperature and confinement time. Attempts to increase the triple product led to targeting larger plants. Larger plants move structural materials further away from the centre of the plasma, which reduces conduction and radiation losses since more of the radiation is internally reflected. This emphasis on [...] as a metric of success has impacted other considerations such as cost, size, complexity and efficiency. This has led to larger, more complicated and more expensive machines such as ITER and NIF.|$|E
2500|$|In {{traditional}} ICF devices {{the driver}} laser {{is used to}} compress the target to very high densities. The shock wave created by this process further heats the compressed fuel when it collides {{in the center of}} the sphere. If the compression is symmetrical enough the increase in temperature can create conditions close to the <b>Lawson</b> <b>criterion,</b> leading to significant fusion energy production. If the resulting fusion rate is high enough, the energy released in these reactions will heat the surrounding fuel to similar temperatures, causing them to undergo fusion as well. In this case, known as [...] "ignition", a significant portion of the fuel will undergo fusion and release large amounts of energy. Ignition is the basic goal of any fusion device.|$|E
2500|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} these reactions, {{in addition to the}} reactants, the products, and the energy released, one needs to know something about the cross section. Any given fusion device has a maximum plasma pressure it can sustain, and an economical device would always operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that /T2 is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product nTτ required for ignition is a minimum, since that required value is inversely proportional to /T2 (see <b>Lawson</b> <b>criterion).</b> (A plasma is [...] "ignited" [...] if the fusion reactions produce enough power to maintain the temperature without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of /T2 at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.|$|E
2500|$|The {{thermonuclear}} burn {{would produce}} (like the fission fuel in the primary) pulsations (generations) of high-energy neutrons {{with an average}} temperature of 14 MeV through Jetter's cycle. The cycle {{is a combination of}} endothermic and exothermic neutronic reactions involving lithium and deuterium/tritium. The reaction's neutronicity was estimated at ~0.885 (for a <b>Lawson</b> <b>criterion</b> of ~1.5). These figures do not count the Li isotope, where the LiD has a neutronicity of ~0.835 and, along with the cross-sections, were given as group averages from about 2.40 to approximately 2.55 MeV and from 14.0 to 14.1 MeV; the small power group is not statistically present (see also Nuclear fusion). As SHRIMP, along with the RUNT I and ALARM CLOCK were to be high-yield shots required to assure the thermonuclear [...] "emergency capability", their fusion fuel may have been spiked with additional tritium, in the form of LiT. All of the high-energy 14 MeV neutrons would cause fission in the uranium fusion tamper wrapped around the secondary and the spark plug's plutonium rod. The ratio of deuterium (and tritium) atoms burned by 14 MeV neutrons spawned by the burning was expected to vary from 5:1 to 3:1, a standardisation derived from Mike, while for these estimations, the ratio of 3:1 was predominantly used in ISRINEX. The neutronicity of the fusion reactions harnessed by the fusion tamper would dramatically increase the yield of the device.|$|E

50|$|A mix of D-T at {{standard}} conditions does not undergo fusion; the nuclei {{must be forced}} together before the nuclear force can pull them together into stable collections. Even in the hot, dense center of the sun, the average proton will exist for billions of years before it fuses. For practical fusion power systems, the rate must be dramatically increased; heated to {{tens of millions of}} degrees, and/or compressed to immense pressures. The temperature and pressure required for any particular fuel to fuse is known as the <b>Lawson</b> <b>criterion.</b> These conditions have been known since the 1950s when the first H-bombs were built.

50|$|Ideally, {{the energy}} needed {{to heat the}} fuel would be made up by the energy {{released}} from the reactions, keeping the cycle going.

50|$|He is {{particularly}} remembered for the <b>Lawson</b> <b>criterion,</b> a general {{measure of a}} system that defines the conditions needed for a fusion reactor to achieve net power.

5000|$|In {{nuclear fusion}} research, the term [...] "break-even" [...] {{refers to a}} fusion energy gain factor equal to unity; this {{is also known as}} the <b>Lawson</b> <b>criterion.</b> The notion can also be found in more general phenomena, such as percolation, and is rather similar to the {{critical}} threshold. In energy, the break-even point is the point where usable energy gotten from a process equals the input energy.|$|E
50|$|Fusion {{reactions}} combine light atomic nuclei such as hydrogen to form heavier ones such as helium, producing energy. In {{order to}} overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them, the nuclei must have a temperature of several {{tens of millions of}} degrees, under which conditions they no longer form neutral atoms but exist in the plasma state. In addition, sufficient density and energy confinement are required, as specified by the <b>Lawson</b> <b>criterion.</b>|$|E

50|$|While MCF and ICF {{attack the}} <b>Lawson</b> <b>criterion</b> problem from {{different}} directions, MTF attempts to work between the two.

50|$|After {{a number}} of {{modifications}} to the beam injection system, the newly equipped PLT began setting records and eventually made several test runs at 60 million K, more than enough for a fusion reactor. To reach the <b>Lawson</b> <b>criterion</b> for ignition, all that was needed was higher plasma density, and {{there seemed to be}} no reason this would not be possible in a larger machine.
