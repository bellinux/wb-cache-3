It consists of steel links held together by rivets, and superficially resembles the bicycle-style roller chain, although it is closer in design to a <b>leaf</b> <b>chain.</b> Its key differences are sharp cutting teeth {{on the outside of the}} chain loop, and flat drive links on the inside, to retain the chain on the saw's bar and allow propulsion by the engine or motor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Nowadays tobacco {{enterprises}} {{are required}} to enhance the level of tobacco leaf management {{in order to increase}} their competitiveness in complex markets. Tobacco <b>leaf</b> value <b>chain</b> management plays a fundamental role in this process as the correct implementation of strategies is determined by the information transfer and integration within the enterprise. This paper presents the tobacco <b>leaf</b> value <b>chain</b> management model by through the collaboration of ERP and PDM system with SAP XI as the enterprise service bus. Under this collaboration management model, PDM system manage the whole life cycle of tobacco leaf, and in ERP system, manage all business processes, systems interactive information by the way of Web Services. Therefore, logistics, capital flow and information flow can be better unified management in tobacco leaf management. And this model could achieve the information support for tobacco resource procurement management and aimed at reduce the operating costs of production, thereby enhancing the market competitiveness of the cigarette products...|$|R
40|$|Packet {{classification}} {{is one of}} the key {{technologies to}} support differentiated services to classified flows. Combining the top-down lookup tree structure and intelligent constructing strategy of present algorithms, this paper proposes a hybrid approach to packet classification. The filter set, which is used to classify packets, are stored in the <b>leaf</b> <b>chains</b> of a special data structure, in which an index table acts as index to locate several lookup trees. Also, an evaluation formula shows the major criteria on how to build lookup trees and distribute filters to obtain satisfactory efficiency. The performance of the proposed algorithm is discussed by analytical computation and simulation. Theoretically, it has a logarithmic execution time cost with a polynomial space (storage) cost. Further, a simulation of packet classifier built on IBM Power Network Processor is performed to test its performance and do a comparison between multi-tree applied cases and the unapplied. The results show its superiority in complex filter handling and matching modes. [Keywords] IP flow, packet classification, filter set, lookup tre...|$|R

To achieve this we embed a massspring system into a mesh representing the leaf, and couple the mass-spring parameters with a simulation representing the fluid flow and evaporation occurring in the <b>leaf.</b> This <b>chain</b> of events aims to simulate the natural process that connects the leaf structural deformation to the water amount in the cells through the turgor pressure.

Lean production system {{is reported to have}} the capability to improve efficiency through lowering cost, reducing lead time (faster delivery) and higher quality. The purpose of this reasearch is to design supply chain performance improvement system of aromatic chemical industry, using modified Rother and Shook’s value stream mapping (VSM) model for aromatic chemical industry. Aromatic chemicals of clove leaf oil derivative were used in this research. VSM – current state of clove <b>leaf</b> oil supply <b>chain</b> showed that total lead time starting from clove leaf was collected up to clove leaf oil received by aromatic chemical company is 34 days, and the processing time is only 3 days.

40|$|Large-scale {{processing}} of leaves for food applications requires quick processing or stabilisation to avoid perishability, {{due to the}} high moisture content in this biomass. Leaf perishability {{is compounded by the}} seasonal availability of crops, like sugar beet plants, of which the leaves are regarded as a potential protein source. This study evaluates the resource efficiency of a hypothetical sugar beet <b>leaf</b> processing <b>chain</b> by comparing supply chain options. First, two options consider leaf processing with and without stabilising the leaves by freezing. Then, these two options are considered in a centralised and decentralised process configuration. The latter places leaf freezing and pressing at the farm and further processes occur at a central facility. Energy usage and exergy consumption were used to quantify the thermodynamic performance of the processing options. Freezing has negligible effect on the process-ability of the leaves in terms of protein content and protein yield. The overall resource efficiency of the process was dominated by the amount of leaf material effectively used, which stresses the importance of full use of all (side-) streams. This outcome also explains the limited additional energy requirements for freezing. Exergetic indicators were affected by variations on the dry matter content of the starting biomass, compared to a negligible effect of other parameters (equipment scale, efficiency or energy use). Transportation load and soil quality were also discussed for the centralised and decentralised configurations. On-farm {{processing of}} the leaves (decentralised chain) clearly reduces the transportation load due to the large difference in bulk densities of leaves (73 kg/m 3) and leaf juice (1000 kg/m 3). Additionally, decentralised scenarios enable direct returning of the leaf pulp to the soil and thereby improving soil quality (i. e. nutrient retention and fe rtility). Soil quality is required to fully assess the use of biomass that is currently regarded as waste, but that actually plays a role in soil fertility. Therefore, the preferred chain configuration would be a decentralised system where the leaves are directly pressed at the farm, the pulp is used to fertilise the soil, and the leaf juice is chilled transported to a centralised factory...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} competiveness {{of the fair}} trade tea value chain through a comparative study of the conventional and fair trade tea value chains in Kabarole district, Uganda. By examining this economically important subject, it clarifies {{the process by which}} value chains compete for smallholder farmer’s leaf and the constraints that the chains experience in their functioning. Comparison of the value chains involved the use of four indicators namely; green leaf price, fertilizer pricing, green leaf market share and auction selling prices. Two major research strategies were employed: (1) a quantitative analysis of smallholder data through a survey of 45 respondents and (2) case studies of two tea processors. Additional information was collected from literature and interviews. The data collected was analysed using SPSS 16. 0 statistical program. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the responses of farmers in the value chains to a number of issues relevant to the study. Cross tabulation was employed to compare the conventional and fair trade harvest share from farmers selling to both value chains. This thesis examined how farmers decide to which value chain they market their green <b>leaf.</b> The value <b>chain</b> concept was used through out the discussion of the results and the roles of the stakeholders. In conclusion it was revealed that the conventional value chain was more competitive for smallholder leaf compared to the fair trade value chain. The study thereafter generated recommendations to contribute to improving the leaf supply into the fair trade value chain...|$|R
