5|$|The M249 <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> (LMG), {{formerly}} {{designated the}} M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) and formally written as <b>Light</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Gun,</b> 5.56mm, M249, is the American {{adaptation of the}} Belgian FN Minimi, a <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> manufactured by the Belgian company FN Herstal (FN). The M249 is manufactured in the United States by the local subsidiary FN Manufacturing LLC in South Carolina and is widely used in the U.S. Armed Forces. The weapon was introduced in 1984 after being judged the most effective {{of a number of}} candidate weapons to address the lack of automatic firepower in small units. The M249 provides infantry squads with the high rate of fire of a machine gun combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle.|$|E
5|$|The M249 LMG entered {{service in}} 1984 as the M249 SAW. Initial {{reactions}} to the gun were mixed: it fulfilled the <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> role well when fired from the ground, but was not as effective when fired from the shoulder or hip. It was praised for its extreme durability and massive firepower, though {{a number of areas}} for improvement were highlighted: the blank firing attachment fitted poorly, the bipod was very weak and broke easily, the sling attachment was awkward, and there were many slots and gaps that accumulated dirt. Some claimed that the heavy-barrelled version of the M16 rifle was a more effective <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Army {{decided that}} an {{individual}} machine gun, lighter than the M60, but with more firepower than the M16, would be advantageous; troops {{would no longer have}} to rely on rifles for automatic fire. Through the 1960s, the introduction of a machine gun into the infantry squad was examined in various studies. While there was a brief flirtation with the concept of a flechette- or dart-firing Universal Machine Gun during one study, most <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> experiments concentrated on the Stoner 63 <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun,</b> a modular weapon that could be easily modified for different purposes. The Stoner63 LMG saw combat for a brief period in Vietnam with the Marine Corps, and later on a wider scale with the U.S. Navy SEALs.|$|E
5|$|The M249 is a belt-fed <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b> It fires the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge, {{usually a}} {{combination}} of one M856 tracer and four M855 ball cartridges fed from M27 linked belts. Belts are typically held in a hard plastic or soft canvas box attached to {{the underside of the}} weapon.|$|E
5|$|Although {{initially}} the infantry battalions of the 6th Division adopted the Australian battalion structure of two rifle companies, a support company, a <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> platoon and an administrative headquarters, they soon {{switched to the}} British structure with four rifle companies– each consisting of three platoons with three sections– and a headquarters company consisting of signals, carrier, pioneer, anti-aircraft, transport, administrative and mortar platoons.|$|E

5|$|Later in {{the morning}} North Korean barges crossed the Naktong below A Company. The company sent a squad with a <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> to the {{southern}} tip of the ridge overlooking Agok to take these troops under fire. When the squad reached the tip of the ridge they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base. The company hit these houses with artillery. The North Koreans broke from the houses, running for the river. At this the <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> {{at the tip of the}} ridge took them under fire, as did another across the Naktong to the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector. Proximity fuze artillery fire decimated this group. Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force. In the afternoon, US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company; only part of it was recovered. The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night.|$|E
5|$|The {{hull and}} turrets of the T-26 mod. 1931 had a maximum armour {{thickness}} of 13–15mm (until 1938, see below), which {{was sufficient to}} withstand <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> fire. Many twin-turreted tanks of the first series had 10mm armour plates of low quality, which could be penetrated by 7.62mm armour-piercing bullets from 150m.|$|E
5|$|Support fire is {{provided}} by the FN Minimi <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> and the L7 general-purpose machine gun (GPMG), and indirect fire {{is provided}} by L16 81mm mortars. The L129A1 sharpshooter rifle was brought into service during the war in Afghanistan to give the infantry a long-range weapon. Sniper rifles include the L118A17.62mm, L115A3 and the AW50F, all manufactured by Accuracy International. Other weapons, such as the L128A1 (Benelli M4) combat shotgun, may be temporarily used.|$|E

5|$|An {{independent}} {{company at}} this time had a nominal strength of 20 officers and 275 other ranks. Larger than a conventional infantry company, it was organised into three platoons, each of three sections, each of which contained two subsections. It had considerable firepower. Each subsection had a Bren <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b> The gunner's two assistants carried rifles and extra 30-round Bren magazines. A sniper also carried a rifle, as did one man equipped with rifle grenades. The remaining four or five men carried Owen submachine guns. Each platoon also had a section of 2-inch mortars.|$|E
5|$|In May 1940, the Directorate of Fortifications and Works (FW3) {{was set up}} at the War Office. Its {{purpose was}} to provide basic pillbox designs which could be {{constructed}} by soldiers and local labour at appropriate defensive locations. In the following June and July FW3 issued 6 basic designs for rifle and <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> pillboxes, designated Type 22 to Type 27. In addition, there were designs for gun emplacements suitable for either the Ordnance QF 2 pounder or the Hotchkiss 6 pounder gun (designated Type 28) and a design for a hardened medium machine gun emplacement.|$|E

Common weapons included the Mosin–Nagant bolt-action rifle, SKS and AK-47 automatic rifles and the Soviet PPSh-41. Machine guns such as the Degtyarev <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> were widely used, along with the DShK and the SG-43 Gorunov. FRELIMO were supported by mortars, recoilless rifles, RPG-2s and RPG-7s, Anti-aircraft weapons such as the ZPU-4 and from 1974 the Strela 2.|$|E

Australia does not possess {{weapons of mass destruction and}} has ratified the Biological Weapons Convention, Chemical Weapons Convention and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Although most of the ADF's weapons are only used by single service, there is an increasing emphasis on commonality. The three services use the same small arms and the FN Herstal 35 is the ADF's standard hand gun, the F88 Austeyr the standard rifle, the F89 Minimi the standard light support weapon, the FN Herstal MAG-58 the standard <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> and the Browning M2HB the standard heavy machine gun.|$|E
5|$|The gliders {{carrying}} the brigade headed for two separated landing areas, Landing Zone 'W' (LZ-W) {{to the east}} of Saint-Aubin-d'Arquenay and Landing Zone 'N' (LZ-N) to the north of Ranville. The gliders landing on LZ-W contained the remaining men of the 2nd OBLI, and 'A' Company, 12th Devons landed at LZ-W. Given the limited availability of aircraft, the remainder of the Devons battalion and the divisional troops were transported by sea, arriving at Sword Beach on 7June. The brigade headquarters and 1st RUR landed at LZ-N. LZ-N was still within range of the German defenders, and the disembarking troops were subjected to <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> and mortar fire. However, they only lost one man, who was killed by a sniper.|$|E
5|$|Although {{found to}} be {{reliable}} and accurate, the M249 was considered to present unacceptable hazards {{in the form of}} an exposed hot barrel and sharp edges. There were complaints that the front sight required special adjustment tools. On August 23, 1985, then-U.S. Under Secretary of the Army James R. Ambrose suspended M249 production pending the development of the product improvement program (PIP) intended to fix these problems. Congress deleted funds for the M249 from the Fiscal Year 1986 defense budget, then retroactively set aside the program's prior year's funds from the M249 program for other purposes, including retirement and pay raises. Over 1,100 M249s already issued were to remain in use, but be retrofitted with the PIP kit when it became available. Over 7,000 remaining M249s were to stay in storage at depots until corrective changes could be made. The PIP kit was eventually developed and implemented, and production of the M249 resumed. In 1994 the M249 squad automatic weapon was re-designated the M249 <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> {{were first}} {{introduced}} in World War I {{to boost the}} firepower of advancing infantry. By the end of World War II, <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> were usually being issued {{on a scale of}} one per fire team or squad, and the modern infantry squad had emerged with tactics that were built around the use of the LMG to provide suppressive fire.|$|R
5|$|The Dutch Infantry used about 2,200 7.92mm Schwarzlose M.08 machine guns, partly licence produced, {{and eight}} hundred Vickers machine guns. Many {{of these were}} fitted in the pillboxes; each {{battalion}} had a heavy machine gun company of twelve. The Dutch infantry squads were equipped with an organic <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun,</b> the M.20 Lewis machine gun, of which about eight thousand were available. This weapon was prone to jamming and not very suitable for offensive operations. Most Dutch infantry were equipped with the Dutch Mannlicher rifle, {{a variant of the}} Mannlicher M1893. This weapon had been in service with the Dutch military for over 40 years and its obsolescence had become obvious, but the Dutch military did not have the money to replace it. There were but six 80mm mortars for each regiment. This lack of firepower seriously impaired the fighting performance of the Dutch infantry.|$|E
5|$|After a brief stay in Sydney {{where the}} battalion's {{equipment}} deficiencies were made good and some reinforcements were received from local recruit training depots, they embarked again on 10 January in company with HMAS Canberra, and proceeded through the Bass Strait. As {{they were under}} way, the troops were kept occupied with training on the Bren <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> and the Thompson sub-machine gun, quantities of which were hastily added to the battalion's equipment scale. They reached Fremantle, Western Australia, on 15 January and overnight, {{a large number of}} 2/4th men defied orders to stay aboard ship and went ashore to spend time with their families; when the Aquitania sailed the next day, 94 men were left behind. The situation in Malaya was grave as the Japanese were steadily pushing the British and Commonwealth defenders south down the peninsula and as the gravity of the situation dawned upon the Australian government, a knee-jerk reaction saw the dispatch of 150 partially trained reinforcements from Northam. They arrived just as the Aquitania departed, being ferried out to Rottnest Island where they joined the ship's company late in the afternoon of 16 January. Although the reinforcements made good the men that had been left behind, they were only partially trained and ill-prepared for the fighting that would follow.|$|E
5|$|Attempts to outflank the bunkers were {{answered}} with heavy fire from a Japanese medium machine gun {{and another man}} was killed and three more wounded. As the attack began to falter, one of the wounded, 20-year-old Private Frank Partridge, who had been injured in the arm and thigh, braved the heavy fire that was being put down towards him and gathered the Bren <b>light</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> from the gunner who had been killed. After pouring suppressing fire onto the bunker, he discarded the Bren and regathered his rifle, before rushing towards the bunker with a grenade and killing its occupants. Partridge's actions reinvigorated the attack and allowed the Australians to temporarily take the second Japanese position. After the wounded were recovered, the Australians withdrew having lost three men killed and five wounded. Against this eight Japanese were confirmed to have been killed. For his actions during the attack on 24 July, Partridge was awarded the Victoria Cross, the British Commonwealth's highest military decoration. He was the last Australian to be awarded the medal during the Second World War, and was also the youngest.|$|E
