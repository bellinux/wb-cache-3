5|$|During December 1914, O'Leary saw heavy {{fighting}} with the Irish Guards and was Mentioned in Despatches and subsequently promoted to Lance Corporal on 5 January 1915. Three weeks later, on 30 January, the Irish Guards were ordered to prepare for an attack on German positions near Cuinchy on the La Bassée Canal, {{a response to a}} successful German operation in the area five days before. The Germans attacked first however, and on the morning of 1 February seized a stretch of canal embankment on the western end of the 2nd Brigade <b>line</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> company of Coldstream Guards. This section, known as the Hollow, was tactically important as it defended a culvert that passed underneath a railway embankment. 4 Company of Irish Guards, originally in reserve, were tasked with joining the Coldstream Guards in retaking the position at 04:00, but the attack was met with heavy machine gun fire and most of the assault party, including all of the Irish Guards officers, were killed or wounded.|$|E

25|$|The {{first section}} of the <b>line</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{junction}} west of Taunton to Wiveliscombe opened on 8 June 1871; there was one intermediate station, at Milverton. A station was opened at the junction on the main line on 1 June 1873; it was named at Norton Fitzwarren. The section from Wiveliscombe to Barnstaple opened on 1 November 1873 with nine new stations, but two more were added later, one in 1928 {{and the other in}} 1932.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1917 {{the line}} again found itself in {{bankruptcy}} and was very nearly scrapped due to {{the high price of}} scrap metal during World War I.

There were 10 cabins, a maximum of 8 of which could be used at any time, and each cabin carried up to 22 passengers and a conductor.|$|E

Hart was given his first competitive cap in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier, a 4–0 win against Bulgaria at Wembley Stadium; he made three crucial saves, one of which he palmed away to begin the counterattack that led to an England goal. He won another two caps November 2011 in friendlies against world champions Spain and Sweden, in each case keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 England victory.|$|E

On 31 October, Beersheba was {{captured}} after the town was attacked by two infantry and two mounted divisions. The 1st Light Horse and the New Zealand Brigades made a combined attack on Tel el Saba, after the 2nd Light Horse Brigade had cut the road north from Beersheba to Hebron. At 15:00 the same day, the New Zealanders attacked and captured with 132 prisoners and four machine-guns with a bayonet charge, while the retreating Turkish soldiers were pursued by the 1st Light Horse Brigade. Chaytor's troops were now in possession of Tel el Saba. At 15:30, orders were issued for the final assault on Beersheba; the 1st Light Horse Brigade was tasked with capturing a <b>line</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> prominent mound outside to the Beersheba mosque. Beersheba was finally taken following a mounted infantry charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 Hinck assumed Greenpeace USA's key {{leadership}} position of Campaign Director. In that capacity, Hinck worked with Greenpeace Canada {{to confront a}} Russian whaling operation on the Siberian coast in the North Pacific. On July 18, 1983, Greenpeace’s flagship Rainbow Warrior sailed into Soviet waters off Siberia just as {{the annual meeting of}} the International Whaling Commission was underway in Cambridge, England. The Greenpeace ship landed at a remote whaling station, where seven Greenpeace activists went ashore and were arrested. The Rainbow Warrior started out to sea in order to deliver to the outside world documentation of the whaling operation and the arrest of Greenpeace workers. Pursued by a warship, a merchant vessel and a helicopter, the Rainbow Warrior escaped across the Bering Strait to US waters near Nome, Alaska. The Greenpeace activists were held captive for five days while Hinck negotiated their release with Soviet authorities. The transfer was made at sea on the International Date <b>Line</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Soviet warship to the Rainbow Warrior before a worldwide media audience.|$|E
25|$|Chesterfield {{is home to}} the Football League Two club Chesterfield F.C. who {{formerly}} {{played at}} the Recreation Ground (usually referred to as Saltergate). Chesterfield FC are known as the Spireites, after the Crooked Spire in the town. In 2005 plans were announced to build a new stadium on the old Dema Glass site north of the town in Whittington Moor. Construction of the new stadium, named the 'B2net Stadium' began in summer 2009 and was completed {{for the start of the}} 2010/2011 season. The B2net stadium became the Proact stadium for the 2012–13 season due to the restructuring of the sponsoring company. The team's most notable achievement of recent years occurred in April 1997, when they reached the semi-final of the FA Cup, losing to Middlesbrough in a replay following a 3–3 draw at Old Trafford. It turned out to be one of the most controversial in recent history with Chesterfield having a goal not given when referee David Elleray decided the ball had not crossed the goal <b>line</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Jonathan Howard shot, a decision which was later proved incorrect by video replays. Had the goal stood the club would have progressed to the final of the FA Cup for the first time in its history—a feat which no club in the third tier of the league has achieved. The team has a fierce rivalry with neighbouring town Mansfield.|$|E

As they started to develop the rhythm, chords were added– [...] "G and F, and then resolving it in D, each verse." [...] For the middle section guitar solo, the beat shifts into double-time and the instrumentation heightens the tension. This rhythmic device, originally used in jazz improvisation, was the Yardbirds' signature arrangement. Dubbed a [...] "rave-up", it was a feature of several of their songs.|$|E
