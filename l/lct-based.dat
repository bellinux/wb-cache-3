40|$|This paper {{argues that}} two of the major {{problems}} facing local courseware developers and educators in creating culturally-sensitive <b>lCT-based</b> learning environments are the difficulties of representing cultural artefacts in courseware and of having a model of 2 ̆ 7 culture 2 ̆ 7 that can be implemented in <b>lCT-based</b> systems. A developing learning-object model is presented; one that can be adopted to address aspects of this problem by providing a systematic way to approach implementing and representing cultural artefacts in courseware. This also provides a basis for some aspects of computer-based cultural preservation initiatives. While this approach may have higher short term development costs, the potential long term cultural benefits to the society far outweigh short term considerations. <br /...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{describes}} a visual learning design representation devised in an Australian funded project {{that focused on}} identifying and describing innovative educational practices employing the use of {{information and communication technologies}} (lCT). Referred to as the learning designs project (www. learningdesigns. uow. edu. au), the aim was to produce generic learning design resources and tools to help academics in higher education implement innovative <b>lCT-based</b> learning designs in their own teaching contexts. The chapter describes the learning designs project, details how and why the graphical learning design representation was created and provides an example to illustrate the visual formalism. How the authors have built on this work since the completion of the project is also discussed. The purpose of this chapter is to explain how this visual representation works so as to inform teachers and educational researchers of its potential to serve as a common language to describe learning designs...|$|E

40|$|Lipid {{emulsion}} (LE) containing medium/omega- 6 long chain triglyceride-based emulsion (MCT/omega- 6 LCT LE) {{has been}} recommended {{in the place}} of omega- 6 <b>LCT-based</b> emulsion to prevent impairment of immune function. The impact of MCT/omega- 6 LCT LE on lymphocyte and neutrophil death and expression of genes related to inflammation was investigated. Seven volunteers were recruited and infusion of MCT/omega- 6 LCT LE was performed for 6 h. Four volunteers received saline and no change was found. Blood samples were collected before, immediately afterwards and 18 h after LE infusion. Lymphocytes and neutrophils were studied immediately after isolation and after 24 and 48 h in culture. The following determinations were carried out: plasma-free fatty acids, triacylglycerol and cholesterol concentrations, plasma fatty acid composition, neutral lipid accumulation in lymphocytes and neutrophils, signs of lymphocyte and neutrophil death and lymphocyte expression of genes related to inflammation. MCT/omega- 6 LCT LE induced lymphocyte and neutrophil death. The mechanism for MCT/omega- 6 LCT LE-dependent induction of leucocyte death may involve changes in neutral lipid content and modulation of expression of genes related to cell death, proteolysis, cell signalling, inflammatory response, oxidative stress and transcription.
