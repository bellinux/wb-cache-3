The exact number and borders of these early counties are difficult to determine accurately; they were considered to encompass areas subordinated to a single centre of <b>local</b> <b>authority,</b> but the possessions of significant nobles had a legal status separate from <b>local</b> <b>authority.</b>|$|E

Because the school is usually over-subscribed, priority is given to students in <b>Local</b> <b>Authority</b> Care in the first instance. Students are then ranked according to their aggregate scores in the Eleven Plus, and the distance from a students home to the school (as the crow flies) is used as a tiebreaker.|$|E
40|$|Local {{government}} finance poses {{problems to}} many {{governments in the}} developing world. This is notwithstanding the fact that <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> are {{at the forefront of}} local development efforts. In Ghana, the central government is enjoined by the country’s constitution to devolve at least five percent of the national revenue to <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> annually. For many <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> this has become the main source of finance. Though there are other sources of finance available to the <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> these have been de-emphasised by most <b>local</b> <b>authorities.</b> The paper postulates that the land resources of the <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> provide a veritable source of local revenue which has not been fully tapped by the authorities. Apart from the property rate which all <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> in the country levy, little attention is paid to the potential of the land resources of the <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> as sources of revenue. The paper presents some opportunities available to the <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> to raise money from their land resources...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{originates}} {{from the}} observation that <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> often fail to focus on coordinating activities with locally implanted companies through their local Agenda 21, despite their impact upon said companies and their legal obligations to do so. We thus describe some explanations for this situation {{from the side of}} companies, from <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> and {{from the point of view}} of the tool itself, local agenda 21. The main findings are that there is a need for national support to <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> and for better cooperation both between companies and <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> and among <b>local</b> <b>authorities.</b> The question of different levels of <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> should also be raised. Otherwise the global vision on sustainable development promoted by local agenda 21 shall be lost and actions limited to interesting but incomplete initiatives...|$|R

In connection with that borrowing, certain <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> sought to enter into swap transactions to hedge their exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
