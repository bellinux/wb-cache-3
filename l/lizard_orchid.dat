50|$|Burnettia, {{common name}} <b>lizard</b> <b>orchid,</b> is a genus of {{flowering}} plants from the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It contains only one known species, Burnettia cuneata, endemic to southeastern Australia. It is known from New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria.|$|E
50|$|The largest British {{population}} of the <b>lizard</b> <b>orchid</b> is found amongst sand dunes at Sandwich Bay in Kent, where there are many hundred plants. A relatively large population is found in East Anglia, along the stretch of the Devil's Dyke that runs through Newmarket Racecourse. There {{are a number of}} other sites where it occurs in small numbers.|$|E
50|$|Berrow Dunes, {{west of the}} village, has a golf course, and is a noted {{site for}} various unusual plants, {{including}} a strong colony of <b>lizard</b> <b>orchids.</b> A 200 hectare (494 acre) area was designated in 1952 as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|R
50|$|The {{cultural}} landscape formed by mankind {{over the centuries}} also has {{a great variety of}} habitats and plants however, today, the extensive grassland areas are amongst the most threatened and heavily cultivated habitats. It is on the semi-arid grasslands and juniper heaths that the silver thistle, symbol of the Rhön region, grows, alongside gentians, pasque flowers and wood anemones, as well as orchids like the early purple, fragrant and fly orchids. Rarer flowers include the various bee orchids and the military, lady, burnt, green-winged, man, pyramidal, frog and <b>lizard</b> <b>orchids.</b> Along the southern fringes of the Rhön, on the so-called slopes of steppe heathland (Steppenheidenhängen) grow warmth-loving plants such as white rock-rose, erect clematis and honewort.|$|R
50|$|He {{directed}} and organized three successful explorations into the Amazon jungle, {{to places like}} the top of Tepuis with gigantic holes, to Tapirapeco, where {{they were the first}} non-Amazonian humans to be seen by several tribes in the border between Brazil and Venezuela. These expedition brought an enormous wealth of new species to science and proved that the high tepuis of the Amazon were isolated enough to allow the evolution of separate species of insects, <b>orchids,</b> <b>lizards</b> and even birds.|$|R
5000|$|Himantoglossum hircinum, the <b>lizard</b> <b>orchid,</b> is {{a species}} of orchid in the genus Himantoglossum found across Europe, from Spain eastwards to the Balkans and in western North Africa. It is usually rare but can {{sometimes}} be found in great numbers in suitable habitats. This orchid grows in dry meadows, rocky areas, and open woods. It may reach a height of 133 cm.|$|E
50|$|Anthidium cingulatum is {{a species}} of bee in the family Megachilidae, the leaf-cutter bees or mason bees which is found in southand central Europe east to Siberia and south to North Africa and Iran. It feeds on the nectar and pollen of plants in the {{families}} Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Lamiaceae while males have been recorded as pollinarors of the <b>lizard</b> <b>orchid</b> Himantoglossum caprinum in Crimea.|$|E
40|$|A new name, Himantoglossum jankae, {{is given}} to the widely {{recognised}} <b>lizard</b> <b>orchid</b> species that is distributed primarily in the Balkan Peninsula and the northwestern region of Asia Minor and has been erroneously named H. caprinum in most previous literature. The new species differs from its closest relatives in having the combination of relatively large, reddish-purple coloured flowers and labella that bear red papillate spots and comparatively long spurs. We present a morphological description of H. jankae, together with illustrations, distribution information and diagnostic comparisons with H. calcaratum, H. adriaticum and H. caprinum...|$|E
40|$|Extract] Lizard {{pollination}} {{is common}} among insular floras, often being {{viewed as an}} island phenomenon (e. g. Withaker, 1987; Olesen and Valido, 2003; Godinez-Alvarez, 2004). Especially, the genus Phelsuma represents a key taxon in the reproduction of many native plant species (Nyhagen et al., 2001; Hansen, Beer and Muller, 2006; Hansen and Muller 2009; Le Péchon et al., 2013). Day geckos are mainly distributed in the southwestern region of the Indian Ocean (e. g. Austin, Arnold and Jones, 2004). These arboreal lizards are known to include {{a major component of}} nectar and pollen in their diet (e. g. Nyhagen et al., 2001; Olesen, Eskildsen and Venkatasamy, 2002; Kaiser 2006; Desoet al., 2008; Olesen et al., 2012; Clémencet et al., 2013; Minaar et al., 2013), and recent studies, conducted on Mauritius' and Reunion's floras (Mascarene Archipelago), have shown that lizard pollination involves a wide range of plant families, including Rousseaceae (Hansen and Müller 2009), Malvaceae (Hansen, Beer and Muller, 2006; Hansen et al., 2007; Le Péchon et al., 2013) and Araliaceae (Nyhagen et al., 2001). In some cases, pollination by Phelsuma species is vital to ensure sexual reproduction of native endangered plants species (Nyhagen et al., 2001; Hansen, Beer and Muller, 2006; Hansen and Müller 2009). To date, only one observation of a Phelsuma visiting orchid flowers has been reported (Micheneau et al., 2010), and beside this "single day gecko visit" in Reunion Island, only one case of <b>lizard</b> feeding on <b>orchid</b> nectar has been reported in Caymans Island (Burton, 2008), but on extra-floral nectaries only without visiting the flowers of Myrmecophila thomsoniana (Rchb. f.) Rolfe. Here we described and discussed the first case of Phelsuma interactions with flowers from the orchid family in Reunion Island, involving the endemic day gecko Phelsuma borbonica Mertens, 1966 visiting flowers of Angraecum cadetii Bosser (endemic to Reunion and Mauritius) and Angraecum bracteosum Balf. & S. Moore (endemic to Reunion) ...|$|R
40|$|Ophrys apifera, or bee orchid: {{the most}} {{widespread}} variety at our site. Anacamptis pyramidalis or pyramidal orchid: another common variety, with close to 2500 plants counted in 2005. This year, a Himantoglossum robertianum or giant orchid was spotted for the first time, an extremely rare specimen to find in our region. The monkey orchid, Orchis simia, gets {{its name from the}} bizarre shape of its labellum (this is actually the third petal, hanging down from the flower), which may remind you of a monkey. Himantoglossum hircinum, the <b>lizard</b> <b>orchid,</b> occurs periodically on the site. It has a rather strong odour, which is why in French it is called orchis bouc (goat orchid). </p...|$|E
40|$|I. Species {{are likely}} to be most {{sensitive}} to climate change at the geographic limits of their distribution. The behaviour of such populations may therefore be a predictor of the response of the species to global change. 2. The northern limit of the <b>Lizard</b> <b>Orchid,</b> Himantoglossum hircinum, occurs in England. where 16 populations are currently known. British records over the past 100 years are particularly accurate for this species {{and it was one of}} the first for which changes in distribution were linked to an amelioration of climate (Good 1936). 3. Early records were checked to confirm the rise in population number in the early part of the century. Analysis of more recent data showed that this was followed by a sharp decline and numbers have only been rising again over the last decade. The range expanded with the earlier increase in population number. but did not contract as populations were lost. 4. Data collected between 1977 and 1998 in the largest population allowed flowering probability and seed production to be correlated with rainfall during the growing season. Analysis of the resulting model showed that both observed rises in population number followed periods during which the seasons for vegetative growth had been wet. 5. Populations have become both larger and more persistent due to an increased interest in conservation. 6. Changes in the abundance of H. hircinum {{are likely to}} depend on other factors. including patterns of human activity. as well as on climate change...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} was undertaken at a sand dune system located along the South East coast of England, known as Sandwich Bay. Sandwich Bay {{has attracted a}} number of environmental designations, including Special Areas of Conservation and a Site of Special Scientific Interest due {{to the presence of}} rare habitats and flora found predominantly at this single site, such as Himantoglossum hircinum (<b>lizard</b> <b>orchid)</b> and Orobanche caryophyllacea (bedstraw broomrape). The research focus centred on concerns surrounding ecological change resulting in the loss of grey dunes, an Annex 1 priority feature. Sandwich Bay has been classed as a Special Site of Scientific Interest in unfavourable condition (Natural England, 2014), based primarily upon the loss of fixed grey dune habitats to neutral grasslands (SD 8 to MG 1 /MG 12 NVC classifications). The aim was to identify causative factors that might account for the observed historic and any current changes in vegetation. The {{research was}} conducted between October 2011 and September 2014, and focused upon hydro-chemical interactions in the environment. Analysis was undertaken by the installation of 103 dipwells across the 520 ha site, in order to obtain groundwater samples. The hydro-chemical and botanical analysis indicated that the vegetation composition was not affected significantly by the chemical constituents within the groundwater. However vegetation composition was significantly modified by variable surface elevation and the related height of the water table. An additional investigation focused upon the identification of management techniques that are thought to be beneficial to dune vegetation restoration. Three management trials were located at three different sites, investigating four different management treatments. Analysis showed that {{there was a significant difference}} between the various management treatments and species composition. Vegetation analysis indicated that both cut and remove, and burning, as management treatments encouraged a greater diversity of species, particularly in sheltered eutrophic areas...|$|E
