The heterogeneity was shown {{at the level of}} single antibody-forming cells using hapten inhibition of hemolytic antibody plaque formation as a measure of affinity. The affinity increased with time after immunization. A high antigen dose initially resulted in relatively low affinity antibody production as compared to the affinity of the antibody production in animals immunized with a low dose. Affinity specialization of immunological memory cells was demonstrated, since it was possible to specifically fractionate such cells {{with regard to}} affinity on hapten-protein-coated plastic bead columns.

To test {{the hypothesis that}} exposure to <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> reduces resistance of epifaunal community to invasion in the Chesapeake Bay, we conducted experiments using standardized settling panels, including 1) controlled experiments exposing epifaunal communities to low DO; 2) measurement of the short term response of motile and sessile epifauna to low DO; 3) survey of multiple sites in which community structure was correlated with <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> and other environmental variables; and 4) evaluation of the biological and structural effects of an invasive hydroid and a cryptogenic tunicate, both with high tolerance for <b>low</b> <b>DO,</b> on recruitment and development of epifauna. Periodic hypoxia was correlated with an increased cover of the native serpulid polychaete, Hydroides dianthus . Cover of invasive and cryptogenic species increased with exposure to moderate <b>low</b> <b>DO.</b> Cover and incidence of bryozoans, sabellid polychaetes, and cnidarians differed among DO treatments. Nematodes, caprellids, and harpacticoid copepods vacated epifaunal communities in response to <b>low</b> <b>DO.</b> In the multi-site survey, > 50 % cover of invasive and cryptogenic species was associated with exposure to chronic <b>low</b> <b>DO.</b> Six of eight sites in the survey experienced periodic <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> ( 40 % of days below 4 mg/l DO).

Species richness and diversity at local sites declined with increasing abundance of certain taxa in higher salinity, higher diversity areas. Heightened cover of Molgula manhattensis, Hydroides dianthus or barnacles led to reduced local diversity but regional species diversity was maintained through environmental heterogeneity across sites. Conversely, in lower salinity, lower diversity zone, Cordylophora caspia, an invasive hydroid, had {{a positive effect on}} some species.

40|$|The Squamscott River has had {{extended}} {{episodes of}} <b>low</b> dissolved oxygen (<b>DO)</b> {{that have been}} recorded at a site near its mouth {{during the past few}} years. These episodes were recorded as a result of temporally intensive monitoring by a datasonde deployed through most of each year. Whereas <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> events can occur during April-November, events during the colder months are typically less frequent and are often caused by unusual natural or severe weather conditions. <b>Low</b> <b>DO</b> events occur most frequently during July-September when elevated levels of nutrients are most likely to contribute to their cause, and are thus of most concern. The study found the warm season time period of July-September to be {{the time of year when}} <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> events were most frequent and pervasive. In comparisons between each year from 2005 to 2007, 2005 had less frequent and pervasive <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> events compared to 2006 and 2007.

Beyond the seasonal and tidal time periods, the time of day where conditions are most likely to cause <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> events is also critical for focusing field efforts. The most frequently observed time of day when either a <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> event was initiated or the <b>lowest</b> <b>DO</b> reading was recorded was in the morning, especially before 8 : 00 AM.

40|$|The Squamscott River has had {{extended}} {{episodes of}} <b>low</b> dissolved oxygen (<b>DO)</b> {{that have been}} recorded at a site near its mouth {{over the past few}} years. These episodes were recorded as a result of temporally intensive monitoring by a datasonde, whereas data {{for the rest of the}} river has been spotty. Thus, the spatial extent of <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> episodes is not known. This study was designed to better characterize the spatial extent of DO conditions along the full length of the river, as well as to determine nutrient and other water quality parameters along the transect to help understand possible causes of <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> levels. Sampling and measurements were taken on five dates in 2005 and one in 2006. Only one date, August 19, 2005, showed spatially extensive <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> levels. Results on the other sample dates were either acceptable levels or <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> levels were confined to small areas on two other dates. The areas where <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> levels occurred on the three dates were all distinctly different areas of the river, possibly reflecting different causes, tidal transport of <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> waters, or sample timing relative to conducive conditions. The nutrient and chlorophyll a levels at the different sampling sites in the Squamscott River did not appear to have any discernable relationship with DO levels. The Exeter WWTF was a consistently significant source of nutrients to the river, but DO conditions at the outfall pipe were never below target levels. This is not surprising because the oxygen demanding processes that are stimulated by nutrients may not take place immediately at the outfall pipe. Thus, the widespread <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> levels on 8 / 19 / 05 downstream of the WWTF may have been caused by discharged nutrients, as well as the more confined <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> levels observed on 8 / 5 / 05. Overall, conditions recorded by the datasonde for 2005 showed greatly diminished episodes of depressed DO levels compared to previous years. Future studies should focus first on verifying the spatial extent of conditions that are conducive to depressed DO levels as indicated by existing sonde data. Such spatially and temporally intensive measurements would provide the basis for follow up sampling for nutrient analyses in problem areas and under conducive conditions to discern possible causes of depressed DO...|$|R

40|$|More {{than half}} of the energy in {{conventional}} wastewater treatment is consumed by aeration. To achieve substantial energy savings and comply with increasingly stringent effluent nutrient regulations, wastewater utilities are beginning to control and minimize aeration, thereby operating at a lower dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. As utilities implement <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> processes, the impact of DO on non-regulated pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, warrants attention to understand the impact of these technologies on pharmaceutical loads to the environment. This dissertation focuses on the impact of DO on pharmaceutical biotransformation during treatment. <b>Low</b> <b>DO</b> treatment could impact pharmaceutical biotransformation directly by acting as a limiting substrate and slowing the activity of microorganisms involved in biotransformation, and indirectly by selecting for a community that is more (or less) effective at biotransformation. The objective of this work was to evaluate and characterize both direct and indirect impacts of <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> conditions in wastewater treatment bioprocesses on pharmaceutical biotransformation. To characterize how DO concentration directly impacts pharmaceutical biotransformation rates, oxygen half-saturation constants (KO 2) were determined for a suite of compounds that describe the impact of DO on a compound’s biotransformation rate. Indirect impacts of DO concentration on pharmaceutical biotransformation rates were demonstrated using bench-scale nitrifying bioreactors operated for over a year under low (~ 0. 3 mg-DO/L) and high (> 4 mg-DO/L) DO conditions. Results showed that long-term <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> conditions resulted in a greater biomass concentration in the <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> reactor compared to high DO reactor. The greater biomass concentration in the <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> reactor resulted in a community with lower specific pharmaceutical biotransformation rates but greater net biotransformation rates under non-limiting DO conditions. In addition, the <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> reactor supported the growth of a more diverse microbial community. To follow up on this finding, a direct test of how microbial diversity affects pharmaceutical biotransformation was performed using a dilution-to-extinction approach. The results showed a strong positive association between biodiversity and collective pharmaceutical biotransformation rates. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that that substantial energy savings can be achieved by operating at lower bulk liquid DO concentrations (0. 5 - 1 mg/L) without compromising net pharmaceutical biotransformation rates...|$|R

40|$|<b>Low</b> {{dissolved}} oxygen (<b>DO)</b> {{is a common}} feature of many estuarine and shallow-water environments, and is often attributed to anthropogenic nutrient enrichment from terrestrial-fluvial pathways. However, recent events in the U. S. Pacific Northwest have highlighted that wind-forced upwelling can cause naturally occurring <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> water to move onto the continental shelf, leading to mortalities of benthic fish and invertebrates. Coastal estuaries in the Pacific Northwest are strongly linked to ocean forcings, and here we report observations on the spatial and temporal patterns of oxygen concentration in the Columbia River estuary. Hydrographic measurements were made from transect (spatial survey) or anchor station (temporal survey) deployments over a variety of wind stresses and tidal states during the upwelling seasons of 2006 through 2008. During this period, biologically stressful levels of {{dissolved oxygen}} were observed to enter the Columbia River estuary from oceanic sources, with minimum values close to the hypoxic threshold of 2. 0 mg L− 1. Riverine water was consistently normoxic. Upwelling wind stress controlled the timing and magnitude of <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> events, while tidal-modulated estuarine circulation patterns influenced the spatial extent and duration of exposure to <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> water. Strong upwelling during neap tides produced the largest impact on the estuary. The observed oxygen concentrations likely had deleterious behavioral and physiological consequences for migrating juvenile salmon and benthic crabs. Based on a wind-forced supply mechanism, <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> events are probably common to the Columbia River and other regional estuaries and if conditions on the shelf deteriorate further, as observations and models predict, Pacific Northwest estuarine habitats could experience a decrease in environmental quality...|$|R

Hypoxia (dissolved oxygen, DO ≤ 2. 0 mg·L- 1) is most severe from May to August {{during the height of the}} Gulf shrimp fishery, but its effects on the fishery are not well known. Prior studies indicate that hypoxia alters the spatial dynamics of shrimp and other species through habitat loss and aggregation in nearby oxygenated refuge habitats. We hypothesized that hypoxia-induced changes in the distribution of shrimp also alter the spatial dynamics of the Gulf shrimp fleet. We integrated data on the geographic distribution of shrimp tows and bottom DO to evaluate the effects of hypoxia on spatial patterns in shrimping effort. Our analyses indicate that shrimping effort declines in <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> waters on both the Texas and Louisiana shelf, but that considerable effort still occurs in <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> waters off Louisiana, likely because riverine nutrients fuel both benthic production and <b>low</b> bottom <b>DO</b> in the same general regions. The response of the shrimp fleet to hypoxia on the Louisiana shelf was complex with shifts in effort inshore, offshore, westward, and eastward of the hypoxic zone, as well as to an oxygenated area between two hypoxia regimes associated with the Mississippi and the Atchafalaya River outflows. In contrast, effort on the Texas shelf mostly shifted offshore in response to <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> but also shifted inshore in some years. Spatial patterns in total shrimping effort were driven primarily by the number of shrimp tows, consistent with aggregation of the fleet outside of hypoxic waters, though tow duration also declined in <b>low</b> <b>DO</b> waters.
