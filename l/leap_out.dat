5|$|Like the spinner shark, the blacktip shark {{is known}} to <b>leap</b> <b>out</b> {{of the water and}} spin three or four times about its axis before landing. Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump out of the water to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E
5|$|Mike {{continues}} to blast the shark with the impulses, {{causing it to}} <b>leap</b> <b>out</b> of the water again, igniting the bomb as Ellen steers the sailboat towards the shark while thinking back to Sean's demise, the shark's attack on Thea, and when her husband killed the first shark. The broken bowsprit impales the shark in the exact spot where the bomb is, causing it to explode on impact. The shark's corpse then sinks {{to the bottom of}} the sea. Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured, but alive and conscious, floating in the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land. Hoagie then flies Ellen back to Amity Island.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{entrance to}} the cave is flanked by two panels of Shiva dated to the Gupta period, both damaged. The left panel depicts Yogishvara (Shiva as the Lord of Yoga) and the right shows Nataraja (Shiva as the Lord of Dance). The Sadashiva is flanked by two large friezes, one of Ardhanarishvara and the other of Gangadhara. The walls of the mandapa feature other Shaivism legends. All the friezes, states Stella Kramrisch, feature the vyaktavyakta concept of Samkhya, where the state of spiritual existence transitions between the unmanifest-manifest, the figures <b>leap</b> <b>out</b> of the cave walls towards the spectator {{as if trying to}} greet the narrative. Even the manifested Sadashiva is shown to be rising out of the rocks.|$|E

5|$|When swimming, baleen whales rely {{on their}} {{flippers}} for locomotion in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles. Flipper movement is continuous. While doing this, baleen whales use their tail fluke to propel themselves forward through vertical motion while using their flippers for steering, much like an otter. Some species <b>leap</b> <b>out</b> of the water, which may allow them to travel faster. Because of their great size, right whales are not flexible or agile like dolphins, and none can move their neck because of the fused cervical vertebrae; this sacrifices speed for stability in the water. The hind legs are enclosed inside the body, and {{are thought to be}} vestigial organs. However, a 2014 study suggests that the pelvic bone serves as support for whale genitalia.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{crocodilians}} are stalk-and-ambush predators, though hunting strategies {{vary depending}} on the individual species and the prey being hunted. Terrestrial prey is stalked from the water's edge and then grabbed and drowned. Gharials and other fish-eating species sweep their jaws sideways to snap up prey, and these animals can <b>leap</b> <b>out</b> of the water to catch birds, bats, and leaping fish. Small animals can be killed by whiplash as the predator shakes its head. Caimans use their tails and bodies to herd fish into shallow water. They may also dig for bottom-dwelling invertebrates, and the smooth-fronted caiman will even hunt on land. Some crocodilian species have been observed to use sticks and branches to lure nest-building birds. Nile crocodiles are known to hunt cooperatively, and several individuals may feed on the same carcass. Most species will eat anything suitable that comes within reach and are also opportunistic scavengers.|$|E
25|$|Compared to Landini's music, {{in which}} refinement, elegance, and a memorable melodic line were the clear {{goals of the}} composer, Andrea's music is dramatic, restless, and {{sometimes}} disjunct, and includes sharp dissonances to highlight certain passages in the text.

To {{distract}} {{him from his}} pain and fear, the Jester teaches the Twin Brother the art of shadow puppets. This beautiful moment is spoiled by the archers, who, watching at a distance, plot their capture of the two. The Jester hears a sound and investigates, leaving Twin Brother alone. The Twin Brother turns and sees {{the face of the}} Chief Archer's Daughter. Their eyes meet but are interrupted as the Archers <b>leap</b> <b>out</b> and capture him. The Chief Archer's Daughter watches helplessly as the Twin Brother is carried away.|$|E
25|$|Several oceanic squid, {{such as the}} Pacific flying squid, <b>leap</b> <b>out</b> of {{the water}} to escape predators, an {{adaptation}} {{similar to that of}} flying fish. Smaller squids fly in shoals, and have been observed to cover distances as long as 50 m. Small fins towards the back of the mantle help stabilize the motion of flight. They exit the water by expelling water out of their funnel, indeed some squid have been observed to continue jetting water while airborne providing thrust even after leaving the water. This may make flying squid the only animals with jet-propelled aerial locomotion. The neon flying squid has been observed to glide for distances over 30 m, at speeds of up to 11.2m/s.|$|E

25|$|A local tale {{says that}} about 1938–41, when both {{boulders}} were in place, a farmer named James Reynolds often drove {{his horse and}} cart along this pathway. Several times, a hooded grey ghost would hide behind two boulders and would <b>leap</b> <b>out</b> from {{behind one of the}} stones at sunset, and try to grab the horse's reins before vanishing. This, although terrifying the animals, seems not to have perturbed the man unduly. However, he ordered that the stone in question be laid upon his grave after his death, in an attempt at 'laying' the apparition. James Reynolds died in 1941 and, in accordance with his wishes, the boulder now lies atop his grave, his wife Ann Elizabeth also being interred there in 1967. There is no record {{as to whether or not}} the 'exorcism' was successful, and indeed, a local woman who knew the Reynolds could not confirm the story. The other stone of the pair can now be seen lying against the north wall of the churchyard.|$|E
25|$|The second title {{match of}} the night saw long time AAA World Tag Team Champions La Hermandad 187 (Nicho and Joe Lider) defend against Latin Lover and Marco Corleone, who were teaming {{together}} for the first time that night. La Hermandad expertly cut the ring in half, keeping Marco Corleone from tagging out so that they could wear him down. Corleone either came into the match with an existing injury or he bruised his thigh early in the match as he favored his right leg throughout most of the match. The crowd booed the supposed fan favorite Latin Lover every time he entered the ring to help out Corleone, which seemed to irritate him. The end came when rudo referee el Hijo del Tirantes tripped Marco Corleone as he was about to take his trademark <b>leap</b> <b>out</b> of the ring, allowing La Hermandad to pin Corleone, making their eight successful title defense in a row. Following the match Corleone and Latin Lover argued and left the ring separately.|$|E
25|$|On {{a flight}} home from America, he came under mental {{attack by the}} demonic Necromon, causing Brian to <b>leap</b> <b>out</b> of the plane; he spent two years as a hermit on the Cornish coast, {{repairing}} his psyche. He was eventually called to Merlyn's service again, fighting alongside the Black Knight and the elf Jackdaw to defend Otherworld from Necromon. With his memories partially restored Brian and the Knight, allied with Vortigen the Proud Walker, battled Mordred the Evil. Both the Black Knight and Captain Britain were snatched out of time to join the Grandmaster’s Contest of Champions, where Captain Britain fought against the Arabian Knight, but they were soon returned to resume their quest. At the entrance to Otherworld Brian was slain by the spectral White Rider, and his corpse claimed by Mandrac, Nethergod Lord of the Slain and the Rider’s master, though Merlyn and the Knight swiftly recovered it. Merlyn reunited Captain Britain’s departed spirit with his body, resurrecting him. While the hero healed, Merlyn restored his remaining memories and informed him of the Nethergod’s involvement with his early foes. Now recalling Arthur’s location, the Black Knight, Captain Britain and Jackdaw were sent to awaken the King. Succeeding in this quest, Arthur then sent Brian and Jackdaw magically away through the dimensions, stating Brian had a destiny to fulfill elsewhere. As a reward, he and Jackdaw were sent back to Earth.|$|E

25|$|Alex Koslov put his {{recently}} won AAA Cruiserweight Championship {{on the line}} in the third PPV match of the night as he wrestled against Extreme Tiger, Crazy Boy and Alan Stone in a Elimination hardcore match. The match saw the frequent use of both tables and ladders throughout the match, mixed in with steel chairs for good measure. Koslov's reign as the first AAA Cruiserweight champion ended after just over two weeks as he was the first man eliminated from the match, pinned by Alan Stone. With Koslov eliminated it was a guarantee {{that there would be a}} new champion by the end of the match. Alan Stone's inexperience in Hardcore matches caused him to be eliminated secondly, leaving Crazy Boy and Extreme Tiger, both of whom had a great deal of experience with hardcore matches. The final section of the match had several slow sections where one wrestler set up a table, a ladder or an elaborate chair set up while the other wrestler had to lay on the mat and pretend to be knocked down. At one point Crazy Boy very obviously pushed himself into position so that Extreme Tiger could execute a leap off the top rope onto him. In the final moments of the match saw Extreme Tiger <b>leap</b> <b>out</b> of the ring and splash Crazy Boy through a table. After taking a moment to recover Extreme Tiger was able to get back in the ring, only seconds before the referee counted Crazy Boy out. With the count out victory Extreme Tiger was declared the new AAA Cruiserweight champion.|$|E
25|$|African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) packs {{have been}} known to split into several smaller groups while in pursuit; one group initiates the chase, while the other travels ahead of the prey's escape path. The group of chase {{initiators}} coordinate their chase to lead the prey towards the location of the second group, where the prey's escape path will be effectively cut off. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops) have been shown exhibiting similar behaviors of pursuit role specialization. One group within the dolphin pod, known as the drivers, give chase to the fish - forcing the fish into a tight circle formation, while the other group of the pod, the barriers, approach the fish from the opposite direction. This two-pronged attack leaves the fish with only the option of jumping out of the water to escape the dolphins. However, the fish are completely vulnerable in the air; it is at this point when the dolphins <b>leap</b> <b>out</b> and catch the fish. In lion (Panthera leo) pack hunting, each member of the hunting group is assigned a position, from left wing to right wing, in order to better obtain prey. Such specializations in roles within the group are thought to increase sophistication in technique; lion wing members are faster, and will drive prey toward the center where the larger, stronger, killing members of the pride will take down the prey. Many observations of group pursuers note an optimal hunting size in which certain currencies (mass of prey killed or number of prey killed) are maximized with respect to costs (kilometers covered or injuries sustained). Groups size is often dependent on aspects of the environment: number of prey, prey density, number of competitors, seasonal changes, etc.|$|E
500|$|The {{humpback}} {{social structure}} is loose-knit. Typically, individuals live {{alone or in}} small, transient groups that disband after a few hours. Groups may stay together longer in summer to forage and feed cooperatively. Longer-term relationships between pairs or small groups, lasting months or even years, have rarely been observed. Some females possibly retain bonds created via cooperative feeding for a lifetime. The humpback's range overlaps with other whale and dolphin species—for instance, the minke whale. Humpback whales often <b>leap</b> <b>out</b> of the water, a behaviour known as [...] "breaching", and slap the water with their fins or tails ...|$|E

500|$|When swimming, otariids rely {{on their}} fore-flippers for {{locomotion}} in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles. Fore-flipper movement is not continuous, and the animal glides between each stroke. Compared to terrestrial carnivorans, the fore-limbs of otariids are reduced in length, which gives the locomotor muscles at the shoulder and elbow joints greater mechanical advantage; the hind-flippers serve as stabilizers. Phocids and walruses swim by moving their hind-flippers and lower body from side to side, while their fore-flippers are mainly used for steering. Some species <b>leap</b> <b>out</b> of the water, which may allow then to travel faster. In addition, sea lions are known to [...] "ride" [...] waves, which probably helps them decrease their energy usage.|$|E
