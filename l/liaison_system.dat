The training instituted involved hostage situations, negotiations with those making demands, and assaults when it was judged that talks had broken down. Under Wilkes’s leadership, the regiment became adept at responding rapidly to the different tactics employed by terrorists. He also set up a robust <b>liaison</b> <b>system</b> linking the SAS commander to the police, the security services and the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms (Cobra). In an increasingly turbulent world, other countries began to request help from Britain in developing their own specialised units to counter terrorism and to provide VIP protection. Then, in October 1977, a Lufthansa Boeing 737 on its way from Majorca to Frankfurt with some 90 passengers and crew was hijacked by terrorists armed with guns and explosives. The Germans asked the SAS for help and Wilkes dispatched a small team to offer advice to GSG 9, their anti-terrorist squad. The aircraft was stormed successfully at Mogadishu, Somalia, and the hostages freed. The operation gave added impetus to the expansion of training and organisation for anti-terrorist tasks by the regiment. Wilkes moved on in 1979, but the decisive intervention by the SAS in the Iranian Embassy siege in May the following year by Michael Rose (British Army officer) was convincing evidence of the value of his legacy.

40|$|Around 1920 {{the number}} of youth laborers who left home villages to look for jobs in large cities grew steadily. This {{circumstance}} rapidly transformed the youth labor market.

This paper examines how the Youth Employment Service developed and became systematized as the youth labor market emerged in the early 1930 s. The significance of the Service in this period has not been paid much attention because of its low placement performance, but some logical and institutional implications may be found in its history. This paper focuses on the formation of "the Employment Placement for Youth Laborers to 6 large cities" : Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka and Kobe, which was institutionalized in 1933.

40|$|Abstract Background Testing for Borrelia -specific IgM and IgG-antibodies {{are often}} {{performed}} {{on a variety}} of poorly defined symptoms, and isolated IgM results are a frequent finding, which results in diagnostic uncertainty and further testing. We wanted to test the hypothesis that Borrelia-specific assays using recombinant antigens perform differently from assays based on purified flagella antigen. Methods We compared the use of recombinant antigens (LIAISON ® DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy) and purified flagella antigen (IDEIA™ Borrelia, DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) in the assay for Borrelia -specific IgM and IgG-antibodies. The assays were tested on an unselected population of serum samples submitted from general practice. A total of 357 consecutive samples for analysis of Borrelia IgM and IgG antibodies. Furthermore, we analysed 540 samples for Borrelia -specific IgM or IgG antibodies first by the IDEIA™ and, if they were positive, the samples were further analysed using the LIAISON ® assay. To verify the correctness of the patient's serological status, discrepant samples were analysed by line blots (EcoLine, Virotech). Results In the consecutive series of 357 samples, the IgM assays detected 308 negative and 3 positive samples with concordant results. Compared with the line blot, the IDEIA™ system produced 21 false-positive IgM results, whereas the <b>LIAISON</b> ® <b>system</b> produced only one false-positive IgM result. The IgG assays showed 1 positive and 328 negative concordant results. The <b>LIAISON</b> ® <b>system</b> produced 9 true IgG-positive samples that were not detected by the IDEIA™ system, but the former produced 4 positive IgG results that were negative by line blot. Conclusion Diagnostic assays based on flagella antigen seem to show more false-positive IgM and false-negative IgG results than assays based on recombinant antigens. The latter may reduce the number of presumably false-positive IgM results and identify more IgG-positive subjects, but this system also produces more false-positive IgG results. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether there are clinical and public health dilemmas resulting from the reproducibility of routine vitamin D assays. Methods: Blinded agreement studies were conducted in eight clinical laboratories using two commonly used assays to measure serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) levels in Australasia and Canada (DiaSorin Radioimmunoassay (RIA) and DiaSorin LIAISON® one). Results: Only one laboratory measured 25 (OH) D with excellent precision. Replicate 25 (OH) D measurements varied by up to 97 % and 15 % of paired results differed by more than 50 %. Thirteen percent of subjects received one result indicating insufficiency [25 - 50 nmol/l] and another suggesting adequacy [> 50 nmol/l]).

The TGS TA system was compared with our routinely used <b>system,</b> <b>LIAISON</b> XL, for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies. Only in positive IgM samples, TGS TA system was compared to an enzyme linked fluorescent assay (ELFA) test (VIDAS, BioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France) and with <b>LIAISON</b> XL <b>system</b> for the IgG avidity (if possible). Materials and methods: Three hundred sera samples from pregnant women were examined with the TGS TA system and divided in 3 groups according to IgG and IgM screening LIAISON XL tests: 102 were non-immune women (Group 1), 98 were pregnant with past infection (Group 2) and 100 were pregnant with positive or equivocal IgM (95 with positive IgG and 5 with negative IgG) (Group 3). Results: The overall concordance of the IgG results between LIAISON XL and TGS TA was 98. 3 %: 97. 1 % in Group 1, 100 % in Group 2 and 98. 0 % in Group 3. The overall concordance of the IgM results between LIAISON XL and TGS TA was 92. 1 %: 100 % in Group 1, 99. 0 % in Group 2 and 70. 1 % in Group 3.

RESULTS: Results showed that S 100 B levels in patients (P) and siblings (S) were not significantly different from controls (C) (dataset 1 : P vs. C: B = 0. 004, 95 % CI - 0. 005 to 0. 013, p = 0. 351; S vs. C: B = 0. 000, 95 % CI - 0. 009 to 0. 008, p = 0. 926; and dataset 2 : P vs. C: B = 0. 008, 95 % CI - 0. 011 to 0. 028, p = 0. 410; S vs. C: B = 0. 002, 95 % CI - 0. 016 to 0. 021, p = 0. 797). In patients, negative symptoms were positively associated with S 100 B (B = 0. 001, 95 % CI 0. 000 to 0. 002, p = 0. 005) in one of the datasets, however with failure of replication in the other. There was no significant association between S 100 B and positive symptoms or present use or type of antipsychotic medication. CONCLUSIONS: S 100 B is neither an intermediate phenotype, nor a trait marker for psychotic illness...|$|R

The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the new chemiluminescence TGS TA system of Technogenetics (Milan, Italy) for detecting anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies and IgG avidity. The TGS TA system was compared with our chemiluminescence routinely used <b>system,</b> <b>LIAISON</b> XL, supplied by Diasorin (Saluggia, Italy), for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies. Only in positive IgM samples (retrospective study) and for the IgG avidity (if existent), TGS TA system was compared to an Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay (ELFA) test (VIDAS, BioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France). Materials and methods. Three hundred and one sera samples, from women who came to our centre for the routine follow up pregnancy, were examined with the TGS TA system and divided in 3 groups according to IgG and IgM screening LIAISON XL tests: 106 were non-immune women (Group 1), 100 were pregnant with past infection (Group 2) and 95 were pregnant with positive or equivocal IgM (82 with positive IgG and 13 with negative IgG) (Group 3). Results. The overall concordance of the IgG results between LIAISON XL and TGS TA was 99. 3 %: 100 % in Group 1, 98 % in Group 2 and 100 % in Group 3. The overall concordance of the IgM results between LIAISON XL and TGS TA was 93. 9 %: 100 % in Group 1, 94 % in Group 2 and 82. 8 % in Group 3. In Group 3, the concordance between the results of the IgG avidity with the ELFA and TGS TA tests was 81. 7 %. Comparing the clinical diagnosis obtained with our protocol and that of the TGS TA system, the overall concordance was 92. 7 %: 100 % in Group 1, 92. 0 % in Group 2 and 78. 9 % in Group 3. Conclusions. The overall concordance of IgG antibodies is excellent for both protocols while for IgM antibodies is very high in the first group and lower in the third group, due to the presence of non-specific IgM subjects in this group. The TGS TA avidity test seems to predict ealier the maturation of the IgG compared to the ELFA test since many samples with low avidity with the ELFA were seen with moderate avidity with TGS TA and all those with borderline avidity with the ELFA were seen with high avidity with TGS TA. This system shows to be a valuable tool with overall good clinical correlation and able to clearly identify nonspecific subjects, those with a non-recent infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{elements}} of organizational structuring [...] -which show a curious tendency {{to appear in}} five's [...] -suggest a typology of five basic configurations: Simple Structure, Machine Bureaucracy, Professional Bureaucracy, Divisionalized Form, and Adhocracy. The elements include (1) five basic parts of the organization [...] -the operating core, strategic apex, middle line, technostructure, and support staff; (2) five basic mechanisms of coordination [...] -mutual adjustment, direct supervision, and the standardization of work processes, outputs, and skills; (3) the design parameters [...] -job specialization, behavior formalization, training and indoctrination, unit grouping, unit size, action planning and performance control <b>systems,</b> <b>liaison</b> devices (such as integrating managers, teams, task forces, and matrix structure), vertical decentralization (delegation to line managers), and horizontal decentralization (power sharing by nonmanagers); and (4) the contingency factors [...] -age and size, technical system, environment, and power. Each of the five configurations relies {{on one of the}} five coordinating mechanism and tends to favor one of the five parts. In Simple Structure, the key part is the strategic apex, which coordinates by direct supervision; the structure is minimally elaborated and highly centralized; it is associated with simple, dynamic environments and strong leaders, and tends to be found in smaller, younger organizations or those facing severe crises. The Machine Bureaucracy coordinates primarily by the imposition of work standards from the technostructure; jobs are highly specialized and formalized, units functional and very large (at the operating level), power centralized vertically at the strategic apex with limited horizontal decentralization to the technostructure; this structure tends to be found in simple, stable environments, and is often associated with older, larger organizations, sometimes externally controlled, and mass production technical systems. The Professional Bureaucracy relies on the standardization of skills in its operating core for coordination; jobs are highly specialized but minimally formalized, training is extensive and grouping is on a concurrent functional and market basis, with large sized operating units, and decentralization is extensive in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions; this structure is typically found in complex but stable environments, with technical systems that are simple and non-regulating. In the Divisionalized Form, a good deal of power is delegated to market-based units in the middle line (limited vertical decentralization), whose efforts are coordinated by the standardization of outputs, through the extensive use of performance control systems; such structures are typically found in very large, mature organizations, above all operating in diversified markets. Adhocracy coordinates primarily by mutual adjustment among all of its parts, calling especially for the collaboration of its support staff; jobs are specialized, involving extensive training but little formalization, units are small and combine functional and market bases in matrix structures, liaison devices are used extensively, and the structure is decentralized selectively in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions; these structures are found in complex, dynamic environments, and are often associated with highly sophisticated and automated technical systems. In conclusion, it is claimed that the effective Organization will favor some sort of configuration [...] -some type of a logically consistent clustering of its elements [...] -as it searches for harmony in its internal processes and consonance with its environment. But some organizations will inevitably be driven to hybrid structures as they react to contradictory pressures or while they effect a transition from one configuration to another, and here too it is believed that the typology of five can serve as a diagnostic tool in organizational design. organization design, organization structures...|$|R
