40|$|Background {{and aims}}   Nowadays, organisations: trying to utilize HSE system, To {{establish}} an appropriate {{system in the}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> and promotion of healthy work environment without any accidents, injuries, and pollution.   HSE management system is a tool to control and improve the performance of health and safety  and environment in all development programs of industrial and other structural organizations. This is in fact an integrated system, so that all human financial and equipment resources will support each other to provide a healthy and convenience environment with no any accident and injuries.   Methods   In this case study all components of an HSE management system is review briefly and explain the role of this system in accident reduction rate and work efficiency in an oil company in the Persian Golf. Three years activities of HSE system in this company been studied, using all  reports and any related documents. Different variances as indicators had been defined with which  the annual performance of the HSE system, of the company have been evaluated.   Results   The results show that there are significant improvement in health, safety and environment {{during the period of}} 2001 - 2003 as HSE system implemented.   The rate of LTIF decreased from 0. 69 in 2001 to 0. 5 in 2003 or FAR decreased from 2. 2 in 2001 to   0. 7 in 2003, and the air pollution of SO 2 decreased from 397 T. in 2001 to 309 T. in 2003.   Conclusion   This study indicated that although the number of employees, number of working hours and number of projects increased significantly during the years 2001 to 2003, but the rate of  different related indicators decreased such as LTIF, TRIR, FAR and pollutants like SO 2, Co 2, No  and CH 4...|$|E

50|$|Forecasting of {{the wind}} power {{generation}} may be considered at different time scales, depending on the intended application. From milliseconds up to a few minutes, forecasts {{can be used for}} the turbine active control. Such type of forecasts are usually referred to as very short-term forecasts. For the following 48-72 hours, forecasts are needed for the power system management or energy trading. They may serve for deciding on the use of conventional power plants (Unit commitment) and for the optimization of the scheduling of these plants (Economic dispatch). Bids for energy to be supplied on a day are usually required during the morning of the previous day. These forecasts are called short-term forecasts. For longer time scales (up to 5-7 days ahead), forecasts may be considered for planning the <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> wind farms, or conventional power plants or transmission <b>lines.</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>of</b> offshore wind farms may be particularly costly, so optimal planning <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> operations is <b>of</b> particular importance.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new methodology for spatial analysis of conductor thermal aging {{that can be}} performed at three different levels: point, line, and area. The methodology uses known characteristics of transmission conductors, along with load and weather data, to determine time series of conductor temperatures and corresponding thermal aging. Weather conditions can be obtained with high resolution, providing environmental conditions virtually at every point of a transmission system. This novel approach provides a complete spatiotemporal view of the thermal state of the system, bringing a whole new dimension to the research of thermal aging. All described types of aging analysis are important for effective transmission asset management, for scheduling <b>of</b> <b>line</b> <b>maintenance</b> or inspections, and for planning future transmission systems.
