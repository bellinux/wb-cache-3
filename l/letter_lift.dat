50|$|Swype is {{a virtual}} {{keyboard}} for touchscreen smartphones and tablets originally developed by Swype Inc., founded in 2002, where the user enters words by sliding a finger or stylus from the first letter of a word to its last <b>letter,</b> <b>lifting</b> only between words. It uses error-correction algorithms and a language model to guess the intended word. It also includes a predictive text system, handwriting and speech recognition support. Swype was first commercially available on the Samsung Omnia II running Windows Mobile, and was originally pre-loaded on specific devices.|$|R
60|$|He {{went into}} her boudoir, a remote and very cushiony place. She was sitting at her table writing <b>letters.</b> She <b>lifted</b> her face abstractedly when he entered, watched him go to the sofa, and sit down. Then {{she looked down at}} her paper again.|$|R
60|$|The saint, {{who knew}} the king of Achen's {{business}} was not only to drive the Portuguese out of Malacca, but also, and that principally, to extirpate Christianity {{out of all the}} East; having read the <b>letter,</b> <b>lifted</b> up his eyes to heaven, and answered without the least pause, that the affront was too great to be endured; that the honour of the Christian religion was more concerned in it than that of the crown of Portugal: If this injury should be dissembled, to what audaciousness would the enemy arise, and what would not the other Mahometan princes attempt after this example? In conclusion, that the challenge ought to be accepted, that the infidels might see the King of Heaven was more powerful than their king Alaradin.|$|R
500|$|Wheelwright {{received}} intelligence {{concerning this}} publication {{at about the}} time he received the <b>letter</b> <b>lifting</b> his banishment with its unwarranted assumptions. He was deeply stung by the tenor of this work, coming {{at a time when he}} was making serious inroads into putting the events of the controversy behind him with the help and encouragement of some influential magistrates and ministers in the Bay Colony. He did not want his friends and relatives in England to get their impressions of his time in New England from this unfair account of those who had opposed him. To defend his character, Wheelwright obtained the assistance of some friends to help him publish a response to Short Story. In 1645, Mercurius Americanus was published in London under the name of John Wheelwright, Jr., presumably his son, who was in England attending Jesus College, Cambridge at the time. Bell says of this work, [...] "in tone and temper, it is incontestably superior to the Short Story, and, while devoted especially to the vindication of its author's doctrinal views, agreeably to the school of polemics then in vogue, it contains some key retorts upon his detractors, and indicates a mind trained to logical acuteness, and imbued with the learning of the times".|$|R
60|$|The train rushed on, and he {{was across}} the line the same instant, but the blank was his. Up and down the gas-lighted {{platform}} he looked in vain among the crowd, only his eye suddenly lit on a black case close to his feet, with the three letters MAY, and the next moment a huge chest appeared out of the darkness, bearing the same <b>letters,</b> and <b>lifted</b> on a truck by the joint strength of a green porter, {{and a pair of}} broad blue shoulders. Too ill to come on--telegraph, mail train--rushed through the poor Doctor's brain as he stepped forward as if to interrogate the chest. The blue shoulders turned, a ruddy sun-burnt face lighted up, and the inarticulate exclamation on either side was of the most intense relief and satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{came down}} to Chatto's, and found your all too {{beautiful}} <b>letter,</b> and was <b>lifted</b> higher than ever. Next came letters from America properly glorifying my Christian Science article in the Cosmopolitan (and one roundly abusing it,) and a letter from John Brisben Walker enclosing $200 additional pay for the article (he had already paid enough, but I didn't mention that--which wasn't right of me, {{for this is the}} second time he has done such a thing, whereas Gilder has done it only once and no one else ever.) I make no prices with Walker and Gilder--I can trust them.|$|R
60|$|She {{never left}} off, or left {{us for a}} moment. I had arrived early in the day, and we had still {{three or four hours}} before dinner; but she sat there, plying her knitting-needles as monotonously as an {{hour-glass}} might have poured out its sands. She sat {{on one side of the}} fire; I sat at the desk in front of it; a little beyond me, on the other side, sat Agnes. Whensoever, slowly pondering over my <b>letter,</b> I <b>lifted</b> up my eyes, and meeting the thoughtful face of Agnes, saw it clear, and beam encouragement upon me, with its own angelic expression, I was conscious presently of the evil eye passing me, and going on to her, and coming back to me again, and dropping furtively upon the knitting. What the knitting was, I don't know, not being learned in that art; but it looked like a net; and as she worked away with those Chinese chopsticks of knitting-needles, she showed in the firelight like an ill-looking enchantress, baulked as yet by the radiant goodness opposite, but getting ready for a cast of her net by and by.|$|R
60|$|We had {{a prosperous}} journey, except the sea voyage which prostrated all of us--Annunziata, to 'the lowest deep' of misery. At Marseilles we slept, {{and again at}} Lyons and Dijon, taking express trains the whole way, {{so that there was}} as little fatigue as possible; and what with the {{reviving}} change of air and these precautions, I felt less tired throughout the journey than I have sometimes felt at Florence after a long drive and much talking. We had scarcely any companions in the carriages, and were able to stretch to the full longitude of us--a comfort always; and I had 'Madame Ancelot,' and 'Doit et Avoir,' which dropped into my bag from Isa's kind fingers on the last evening, and we gathered 'Galignanis' and 'Illustrations' day by day. Travelling has really become a luxury. I feel the repose of it chiefly. Yes, no possibility of unpleasant visitors! no fear of horrible <b>letters!</b> quite <b>lifted</b> above the plane of bad news, or of the expectation of bad news, which is nearly the same thing. There you are, shut in, in a carriage! Quite out of reach of the telegraph even, which you mock at as you run alongside the wires.|$|R
50|$|Built {{just before}} the South African War, Victory House {{is the epitome of}} a Late Victorian {{commercial}} structure. It was the most prestigious building in Johannesburg and was the first to have a lift which had crowds gaping for weeks. The lift was a technological marvel, complete with a safety apparatus; it also boasted a polished oak cage and an upholstered seat. The lift was supplied by R Waygood of England. An early <b>letter</b> to the <b>lift</b> firm references the employment of a caretaker and the purchase of a bag of coal to operate the boiler which worked the hydraulic lift. The total cost of the original lift, boiler and engine was 1020 pounds. The staircase was made of cast iron, also made in England it was the first fireproof staircase in Johannesburg.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} investigated whether text {{reading and}} copying involve visual attention-processing skills. Children in grades 3 and 5 read and copied the same text. We measured eye movements while reading {{and the number}} of gaze lifts (GL) during copying. The children were also administered letter report tasks that constitute an estimation of the number of letters that are processed simultaneously. The tasks were designed to assess visual attention span abilities (VA). The results for both grades revealed that the children who reported more letters, i. e., processed more consonants in parallel, produced fewer rightward fixations during text reading suggesting they could process more letters at each fixation. They also copied more <b>letters</b> per gaze <b>lift</b> from the same text. Furthermore, a regression analysis showed that VA span predicted variations in copying independently of the influence of reading skills. The findings support a role of VA span abilities in the early extraction of orthographic information, for both reading and copying tasks...|$|R
6000|$|... "Love! Bah! Be in love, so {{that she}} may be shut up in an old barrack with de powders!" [...] The way in which that word barrack was pronounced, and the middle <b>letters</b> sounded, almost <b>lifted</b> the captain off his seat. [...] "Love is very pretty at seventeen, when the {{imagination}} is telling a parcel of lies, and when life is one dream. To like people--oh, yes; to be very fond of your friend;--oh, yes; to be most attached--as I am to my Julie"--here she got hold of Lady Ongar's hand--"it is the salt of life! But what you call love, booing and cooing, with rhymes and verses about de moon, it is {{to go back to}} pap and panade, and what you call bibs. No; if a woman wants a house, and de something to live on, let her marry a husband; or if a man want to have children, let him marry a wife. But to be shut up in a country house, when everything you have got of your own--I say it is bad" ...|$|R
5000|$|On 28 November, el-Tell began {{a series}} of {{meetings}} with Israeli colonel Moshe Dayan, the new military commander of Israeli-controlled Jerusalem, with the objective of establishing a [...] "real cease-fire." [...] On 30 November, an agreement was signed which included provision for a fortnightly convoy to Mount Scopus. The two commanders got on well together and on Dayan's suggestion agreed to establish a direct phone link. On 10 December 1948, Dayan gave a sealed letter to el-Tell to be delivered to King Abdullah. Before delivering the <b>letter</b> el-Tell discreetly <b>lifted</b> the seal and made a photostatic copy of its contents, which was an invitation from Elias Sasson to King Abdullah to restart the negotiations which had been led by Golda Meir before the outbreak of war. On 11 December Sasson met el-Tell and King Abdullah's confidant and personal physician, Shawkat al-Sati. At a meeting on 14 December, Sasson recorded el-Tell saying [...] "strike the Egyptians as much as you like. Our attitude will be totally neutral." [...] There followed a number of secret meetings between Dayan and King Abdullah when el-Tell personally took Dayan wearing a red kefieh to the King's winter palace at Shuneh.|$|R

60|$|For us it {{is enough}} to know that you were {{compelled}} to live by your pen, and that in an age when the author of 'To Helen' and' The Cask of Amontillado' was paid at the rate of a dollar a column. When such poverty was the mate of such pride as yours, a misery more deep than that of Burns, an agony longer than Chatterton's, were inevitable and assured. No man was less fortunate than you in the moment of his birth--infelix opportunitate vitae. Had you lived a generation later, honour, wealth, applause, success in Europe and at home, would all have been yours. Within thirty years so great a change has passed over the profession of letters in America; and it is impossible to estimate the rewards which would have fallen to Edgar Poe, had chance made him the contemporary of Mark Twain and of 'Called Back.' It may be that your criticisms helped to bring in the new era, and to <b>lift</b> <b>letters</b> {{out of the reach of}} quite unlettered scribblers. Though not a scholar, at least you had a respect for scholarship. You might still marvel over such words as 'objectional' in the new biography of yourself, and might ask what is meant by such a sentence as 'his connection with it had inured to his own benefit by the frequent puffs of himself,' and so forth.|$|R
