Li Zhuang, a lawyer who was imprisoned as part of the [...] "Striking Black" [...] policy, said that [...] "the Chongqing model is problematic because the city's leaders do not follow the rule of law". According to Andrew J. Nathan, a political scientist at Columbia University, [...] "the risk for China is that this scandal could taint everyone in power and challenge the legitimacy of the regime". Furthermore, he said, “All the worst things you ever imagined are actually true” and “It’s not <b>like</b> <b>nobody</b> knew about this stuff, but now they know that it really is true and it’s as bad as it can possibly be.” ...|$|E

People think that with a recording artist that shit has {{to be like a}} fucking play by play of their whole life, but it's not. It's imagery, {{and a little bit of}} satire." [...] When asked if he made R music, Ocean replied that he disliked how that in the United States, [...] "if you're a singer and you're black, you're an R artist. Period." [...] Ocean stated that the songs on the mixtape do contain R influences, but that it is not an R album entirely.|$|E
500|$|Becky {{became the}} 50th barmaid at the Rovers Return Inn in June 2008. Kelly opined that the character's ex-con {{personality}} {{would give her}} an advantage behind the bar, explaining: [...] "The previous producer, Steve Frost, loved {{the idea of a}} barmaid who could lose her temper and throw a punch. Becky's an ex-con so she can fight dirty <b>like</b> <b>nobody</b> else." [...] The character's chain smoking tendencies often play out onscreen when she is experiencing stress, something which drew off-screen criticism for her disregard of littering the streets with her cigarette butts. ITV publicity has described Becky as having many different levels to her persona, stating that she loves drinking cider, and that she isn't bothered by how she looks—though when she dresses up she [...] "dresses to the nines" [...] with big earrings, gold rings, logo belts and hair pieces. She dislikes anyone ordering her about, as she cannot handle being told what to do.|$|E

The song appears on his debut mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra, which was released on February 18, 2011. When asked by The Quietus about his own interpretation of the character in the song {{it was noted that}} Ocean [...] "politely withdrew, saying he'd enjoy that discussion but he doesn't want to spoil his audience's experience of his songs". He further commented [...] "but you have fun with the imagery, and for me the whole concept that everything has to be... <b>Like,</b> <b>nobody</b> gets upset with a director when a director's film isn't about his life.

500|$|The title track, {{although}} not {{released in the}} US as a single until 1977, received heavy play in FM radio formats. [...] "Into the Mystic" [...] has also gained a wide following over the years. [...] "Come Running", which reached the American Top 40, rescued Morrison from what seemed then as Hot 100 obscurity. Moondance was both well received and favourably reviewed. Lester Bangs and Greil Marcus had a combined full page review in Rolling Stone, saying Morrison now had [...] "the striking imagination of a consciousness that is visionary in the strongest sense of the word." [...] "That {{was the type of}} band I dig," [...] Morrison said of the Moondance sessions. [...] "Two horns and a rhythm section – they're the type of bands that I like best." [...] He produced the album himself as he felt <b>like</b> <b>nobody</b> else knew what he wanted. Moondance was listed at number sixty-five on the Rolling Stone magazine's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

He praises Clarke's choice in bandmates, calling them [...] "prodigies in their own right" [...] but does not praise the whole album. He called [...] "Larry Has Traveled 11 Miles and Waited a Lifetime for the Return of Vishnu's Report" [...] a [...] "clumsy, failed attempt at summing up the music's history to date" [...] and that [...] "Bass Folk Song No. 6" [...] does not [...] "work [...] well" [...] {{as some of the}} other tracks but [...] "these are minor complaints on an otherwise fine recording". Jeff Winbush of All About Jazz commented that there [...] "are no radical departures" [...] on this album and it sounds as if Clarke is [...] "taking a victory lap here, revisiting past triumphs" [...] but that he [...] "still pull sounds out of his assortment of electric, acoustic and Alembic basses <b>like</b> <b>nobody</b> else, and [...] still slapping, plucking and thumbing his way through contemporary, fusion jazz, rock, funk and whatever else he puts his mind to".|$|E

500|$|The Ecstatic {{was titled}} after Victor LaValle's 2002 dark humor {{novel of the}} same name. One of Mos Def's {{favorite}} novels, it was written about an overweight college dropout who fell into mental illness while living with his eccentric family in Queens, New York. According to Mos Def, the phrase [...] "the ecstatic" [...] was [...] "used in the 17th and 18th centuries to describe people who were either mad or divinely inspired and consequently dismissed as kooks". The phrase resonated with him, as he believed {{no one else in}} hip hop had ever recorded an album like The Ecstatic. [...] "I feel like I was the only person who was capable of making this type of music in this type of way", he claimed. [...] "I don't rap <b>like</b> <b>nobody,</b> I don't try to sound like nobody." [...] He said [...] "the ecstatic" [...] also referred to [...] "a type of devotional energy, an impossible dream that becomes reality but is discredited before it's realized. The airplane, a nutty idea. The telephone, the Internet. People who envisioned those were considered radical or extreme." ...|$|E

It also showed a neon-style aspect of the video, where Roberts wore Nike Air Max trainers, with neon moving sperm-shaped graffiti moving to the beat of the track. OK! magazine responded well whilst noting her unusually short dress in the video, they said [...] "we can't help but feel upbeat and summery when watching the star bounce about for single Lucky Day." [...] Aaron Spencer-Charles of Metro gave a mixed review, whilst describing the video, he ended with [...] "and that's it really. Nicola strolls along with a few colourful effects to keep things interesting. Maybe adding a male model would have made things a bit livelier." [...] Popjustice commented on Nicola's seemingly lack of confidence in the video, stating Nicola, you light up our world <b>like</b> <b>nobody</b> else. But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell, you don't know you're beautiful. Her short-dress in the video sparked criticism from some critics, to which Roberts responded saying [...] "I'm not safe with fashion, and I haven't been for a long time.

500|$|When Dewey Phillips first aired [...] "That's All Right" [...] on Memphis radio, many {{listeners}} who {{contacted the}} station by phone and telegram {{to ask for}} it again assumed that its singer was black. From {{the beginning of his}} national fame, Presley expressed respect for African American performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudup—the originator of [...] "That's All Right"—"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man <b>like</b> <b>nobody</b> ever saw." [...] The Memphis World, an African American newspaper, reported that Presley, [...] "the rock 'n' roll phenomenon", [...] "cracked Memphis's segregation laws" [...] by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its [...] "colored night". Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom. By contrast, many white adults, according to Billboards Arnold Shaw, [...] "did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sexual Healing" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Bill Harris of the Toronto Sun {{praised the}} timeliness of the episode, {{which he said}} has kept South Park relevant throughout its 14 seasons. Harris complimented the episode for addressing the larger issue of how sexual acts among celebrities are dissected and analyzed {{by the media and}} public. MTV News praised the Woods parody, which they said was particularly timely because of the golf pro's recent announcement to return to golf. It said, [...] "It was on-the-nose while still being clever, which is a balance that the makers of [...] "South Park" [...] have mastered brilliantly." [...] Bill Brownstein, from the Canwest News Service, called it [...] "an absolutely blistering and timely satire" [...] on Woods and sexual addiction. A CNN review called the Woods satire [...] "brilliant" [...] and a strong improvement over the previous season's [...] "Dead Celebrities", which also included several cameos of celebrity parodies. The review also found the ending of the episode, with Stan and Cartman growing bored with their video game once it focused on golf rather than sex scandals and fighting, to be a [...] "pretty hilarious gag". Ryan Waxon, of The Cowl, said [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] stood out from other Woods jokes and proved Parker and Stone [...] "can do satire <b>like</b> <b>nobody</b> else". He particularly praised the Woods video game and the subplot with Butters trying to learn about women's pubic hair, claiming, [...] "Butters’ low intelligence and complete innocence make for some the greatest moments that the show has to offer." ...|$|E
