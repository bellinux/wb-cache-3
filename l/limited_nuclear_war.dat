40|$|Whether {{possessed by}} a state or non-state actor, the specter of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs), and more specifically, nuclear weapons and their {{associated}} material, present a significant threat to global security. Notwithstanding {{the fact that there}} are fewer nuclear weapons today than the massive stockpiles that existed during the height of the Cold War, the complexities relating to nuclear security have in many ways intensified amid globalization and porous borders. More states in volatile regions possess such weapons, UN Security Council states are busily modernizing their weapons, and non-states actors have made it clear their intention to use such weapons should they attain them. The emerging prospect of a cyber-attack, or a misunderstanding that could potentially evolve into a <b>limited</b> regional <b>nuclear</b> <b>war,</b> would both have dire global ramifications and are scenarios that should not be considered farfetched. Additionally, concerns pertaining to chemical and biological weapons, the associated ramifications relating to nuclear terrorism, and broader limitations of the NPT regime, all pose major challenges to global stability. In considering all of these areas, this foundational primer for the Rowman and Littlefield WMD Series seeks to inform and advance policy debate in ways that support international security, while also adding important connective tissue between analytical areas in the IR and historical domains that often remain separate. Offering a comprehensive analysis of the evolution and current status of WMDs, this volume will be of great interest to scholars, analysts, and students of security studies, international history, and international relations...|$|R

5000|$|Norfolk is {{described}} as a destroyer, rather than a cruiser, because the Royal Navy and First Sea Lord Earl Mountbatten had seen guided missile destroyers as easier to gain approval from the Treasury than cruisers, when the class originated in the late 1950s. By the late 1960s the armament being fitted to Norfolk was dated and limited with no more than the guns of a mid-1950s destroyer and a supposedly improved Sea Slug missile, a questionable innovation, untested at the time work on Norfolk started. By the mid-1960s Defence Minister Dennis Healy and the Labour Government were withdrawing Britain from a global defence role and rejecting the idea of broken back conventional or <b>limited</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>war</b> in the Atlantic. The Healy Labour defence doctrine was one of tighter nuclear deterrence with the main armament, tactical nuclear and anti-submarine emphasis. Norfolk didn't really fit the strategy and was built to keep shipyards open, and as a low level cruiser for low level defence, diplomacy, third world bush fire wars and recruitment. Eventually such ships could be sold to the third world to aid British interests in South America, the Middle East and Asia where Britain was withdrawing its own forces.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Strangelove takes passing {{shots at}} {{numerous}} contemporary Cold War attitudes, {{such as the}} [...] "missile gap", but it primarily focuses its satire on the theory of mutual assured destruction (MAD), in which each side {{is supposed to be}} deterred from a nuclear war by the prospect of a universal cataclysmic disaster regardless who [...] "won". Military strategist and former physicist Herman Kahn in the book, On Thermonuclear War (1960) used the theoretical example of a doomsday machine to illustrate the limitations of MAD, which was developed by John von Neumann. The concept of such a machine is consistent with MAD doctrine, when it is logically pursued to its conclusion. It thus worried Kahn that the military might like the idea of a doomsday machine and build one. Kahn, a leading critic of MAD and President Eisenhower administration's doctrine of massive retaliation upon the slightest provokation by the USSR, considered MAD foolish bravado, and instead urged America to plan for proportionality and thus, even a <b>limited</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>war.</b> With this logical reasoning, Kahn became one of the architects of the flexible response doctrine, that while superficially resembling MAD, allowed for responding to a limited nuclear strike, with a proportional or calibrated, return of fire (see On Escalation).|$|E
