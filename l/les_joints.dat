40|$|Abstract [...] The {{interaction}} between lattice dislocations and grain boundaries in Ni 3 A 1 has been investi-gated {{by means of}} in situ TEM deformation experiments. The {{interaction between}} screw dislocations and a coherent twin boundary could be analyzed in detail. The interaction mechanism found experimentally was compared {{to the results of}} a computer modelling study. In the computer modelling study, many-body potentials representing Ni 3 A 1 were used. The results of the in situ straining indicate that (110) screw dislocations impinging on a Z = 3 coherent twin boundary that have a Burgers vector that is parallel to the grain boundary plane can be transmitted to the symmetric slip plane in the other grain under influence of an applied stress. A one-to-one comparison with the results of a computer modelling study of exactly the same system in Ni 3 AI can be made and the experiment agrees with the simulations. Also, observations were made of superlattice intrinsic stacking faults (SISF) that were formed {{as a result of the}} interaction between gliding dislocations and the dislocations of a low angle grain boundary (cell wall). The creation of jogs in the line of the gliding dislocation may be the cause of the SISF formation.

International audienceThis paper analyzes {{how different}} combinations of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) dimensions affect corporate economic performance. We use various dimensions of CSR to examine whether firms rely on {{different combinations of}} CSR, in terms of quality versus quantity of CSR practices. Our empirical analysis based on an original database including 10, 293 French firms shows that different CSR dimensions in isolation impact positively firms’ profits but their effect in term on intensity varies among CSR dimensions. Moreover, the findings on the qualitative CSR measure, based on interaction between its dimensions, show that the substitutability of these dimensions is highly significant for firm performance. However, {{in terms of the}} intensity, those interactions produce differential effects. Actually, asking whether a firm starting with a certain configuration cannot perform better by adding or removing some dimension(s) we found that only one configuration fulfills this requirement: green and HR. The interpretation is that when a firm starts with this configuration then it is better not to move to another configuration. In all other configurations, firms can always improve their profits either by adding or removing some dimensions. Finally, the profitability of CSR investments in French firms seems to rely on a specific qualitative mix of different CSR dimensions rather than a pure quantitative approach accumulating practices without designing a consistent set of interactions among them...|$|R

40|$|Our work {{is focused}} on data {{assimilation}} methods {{in the context of}} cardiac modeling in order to perform parameter estimation with perspectives in diagnosis assistance for various pathologies. To that purpose we consider a biomechanical model of the heart, along with two types of data that may be available in a clinical context: cine-Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) and tagged-MRI. Cine-MRI mainly gives insight on the motion of the endo- and epicardium surfaces of the ventricles. Tagged-MRI - in which a grid-like pattern is magnetically imprinted in the tissue - may provide valuable information on the deformation of the heart wall. Flexibility and robustness of the data assimilation procedure is crucial since these various types of clinical data generally involve significant noise or time sampling issues, and are likely to be incomplete in their extent. 	 	The data assimilation method that we use is sequential and made of the combination of two different types of filtering approaches [2, 7]. For the large state space - typically obtained after spatial discretization of the mechanical equations by a finite element procedure - we choose a Luenberger observer (a. k. a. nudging) aiming at driving the simulated system towards the real one by introducing dissipative terms in the dynamics of the state estimation error. This filter is coupled - for the remaining parameter space - with a Reduced-order Kalman filtering [6]. The key point of both methods is a discrepancy measure between the model and the data which are very complex when endeavoring to use clinically relevant data sets. 	 	Before addressing the construction of such discrepancy measures we recall that the biomechanical model considered is built under the general principle of dynamics in a total Lagrangian formulation - see [8]. We use a hyperelastic constitutive law to represent the passive behavior of the cardiac tissue, whereas the active part (i. e. sensitive to electrical activation) is inspired from the dynamical Huxley model and controlled by the electrical activation. The state variables of our mechanical system are the displacement of the solid with respect to a reference configuration, its velocity and the internal mechanical variables describing the active state in the sarcomeres. For our application we will concentrate on the estimation of some contractility parameters that are relevant to represent the hindering of active behavior in an infarcted heart wall - hence appearing in the active part of the constitutive law - but also on passive parameters that characterize regions of the myocardium that may stiffen after infarction. This model coupled with the previously described filtering strategy has led to successful parameter estimation with a real cine-MRI data set in [1], and our work aims at extending the methodological framework in order to combine data obtained from both cine- and tagged-MRI. 	 	Concerning the measurements on the real system we assume some prior steps of image processing. For the cine- MRI we consider segmented left endo- and epicardium surfaces (in the form of triangulated surfaces in practice). For the tagged-MRI we can handle several types of data: deforming tag planes fitting the grid pattern and defined in the normal direction of the image planes, deforming tag grids embedded within the image planes, and finally the apparent displacement vector field obtained by tracking tagging patterns in the raw images [3]. Most of the data that we consider take the form of deforming geometric objects. The major difficulty lies in the difference between the Lagrangian formulation of the mechanical model and the Eulerian nature of such data as no model-point to data-point mapping exists in general. One way to circumvent these difficulties is to feed the filtering procedure with the signed distance between the given data surfaces (or lines) and the corresponding deformed model geometries. This technique can be applied to either endo- and epicardium surfaces [2], deforming tag planes [5] or deforming tag grids (even though a particular spatial interpolation scheme is needed between the image planes in this case). Going further - in terms of data representation - than the classical signed distance function we also consider the so-called currents formalism which has been successfully used in the field of medical image analysis [4]. In this formalism surfaces (or lines) are understood as linear forms on a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). This allows a numerically tractable definition of basic algebraic operations and of the norm on the space in which geometric objects of interest are embedded. This new type of discrepancy measure is free of some standard disadvantages of the distance function (e. g. non uniqueness of model points projection onto the data geometry) leading to significant improvements in the estimation results. Finally, we treat the case of apparent displacements [3] by analyzing the subtle relationship between the mechanical deformation of the heart and the displacements appearing in the 2 D image plane sections, in order to generate with the model the corresponding vector field to be compared with the data. Every cases are illustrated with numerical results where parameter estimation is performed using synthetic data as a first step of validation before using real data sets as in [1].
