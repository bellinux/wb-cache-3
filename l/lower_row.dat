5|$|The {{blast furnace}} {{used at the}} Nyrstar Port Pirie lead smelter differs from most other lead blast {{furnaces}} in {{that it has a}} double row of tuyeres rather than the single row normally used. The lower shaft of the furnace has a chair shape with {{the lower part of the}} shaft being narrower than the upper. The <b>lower</b> <b>row</b> of tuyeres being located in the narrow part of the shaft. This allows the upper part of the shaft to be wider than the standard.|$|E
5|$|Like other nodosaurids, Sauropelta {{was covered}} in armor formed from bony masses {{embedded}} in the skin (osteoderms). The discovery of a skeleton with the body armor preserved in situ allowed Carpenter and other scientists to accurately describe this protection. Two parallel rows of domed scutes ran down {{the top of the}} neck, along the anteroposterior axis (front to back). On the upper surface of the back and tail, the skin {{was covered in}} small, bony nodules (ossicles), which separated larger conical scutes arranged in parallel rows along the mediolateral axis (side to side). Over the hips, the ossicles and larger domed plates were interlocked very tightly to form a structure called a sacral shield. This shield is also found in ankylosaurs like Polacanthus and Antarctopelta. Large, pointed spines lined the sides of the neck, increasing in size towards the shoulders, and then decreasing in size again {{along the side of the}} body until they stopped just before the hips. Behind the hips, flat triangular plates lined the tail on both sides, pointing laterally (outwards) and decreasing in size towards the end of the tail. Carpenter originally described the cervical (neck) spines and caudal plates as belonging to a single row on each side, although more recently he and Jim Kirkland reconstructed them in two parallel rows on each side, one above the other. The upper row of cervical spines pointed backwards and upwards (posterodorsally), while the <b>lower</b> <b>row</b> pointed backwards and outwards (posterolaterally). The bases of each pair of cervical spines and each pair of caudal plates were fused together, greatly restricting mobility in both the neck and upper tail.|$|E

25|$|The {{front teeth}} of Ornitholestes were {{somewhat}} conical, with reduced serrations; the back teeth were recurved and more sharply serrated, {{similar to those}} of other theropod dinosaurs. Henry Fairfield Osborn (1903) counted four teeth in the premaxilla, of which the front tooth was the largest in the upper jaw. In contrast, Gregory S. Paul (1988) depicted the skull with only three premaxillary teeth remaining, much smaller than those illustrated by Osborn. Each maxilla (main tooth-bearing bone in the upper jaw) contained ten teeth, and each dentary (tooth-bearing bone in the lower jaw) contained twelve teeth. The tooth rows of Ornitholestes were short, with the dentary (<b>lower)</b> <b>row</b> being even shorter than the maxillary (upper) row, even though the dentary bone itself was exceptionally long at the back, reaching a point below the middle of the eye socket. Teeth did not extend {{as far back as the}} orbits, and neither tooth row spanned much more than one-third of the skull.|$|E
25|$|Building the new chapel {{with the}} same {{proportions}} as the old one and making it fit {{within the walls of}} the old chapel, with a retained high ceiling inside the walls of the former northeast tower (now the northeast corner of the palace), proved difficult for Tessin if he was to be able to adhere to the austere Baroque style where all the windows aught to be the same size, and placed in precise rows despite what rooms were behind them. To achieve this, Tessin added a mezzanine floor with smaller square windows just above the <b>lower</b> <b>row</b> of windows. These smaller windows now encircles the whole building, a remnant of the first castle chapel. After the fire, when Tessin could make more substantial alterations, the Royal Chapel and the Hall of State were placed in the southern row instead, and the furniture and inventories, such as benches, household silver and decorations are to some extent preserved in the present-day Royal Chapel.|$|E

2500|$|The {{upper parts}} of the walls are covered with a painted frieze, while the spaces between the windows are filled with 17th-century portraits of the Cracow bishops - Jakub Zadzik and his {{successor}} Piotr Gembicki, kings Sigismund III and Władysław IV and coat of arms (same as on the facade). The other walls were covered with a painted effigies of the Cracow bishops - 35 busts of bishops from Paweł of Przemanków (1266–1292) to John Albert Vasa (1632–1634) dating back from {{the first half of}} the 17th century. The <b>lower</b> <b>row</b> of 16 portraits from Jakub Zadzik to Karol Skórkowski (1830–1851) was painted by Aleksander Rycerski, who in the years 1861–1863 carried out a refurbishment of the upper frieze.

40|$|Based on an ITER 15 MA Q = 10 {{inductive}} scenario, {{a systematic}} numerical investigation {{is carried out}} {{in order to understand}} the effect of varying the geometry of the magnetic coils, used for controlling the edge localized modes in tokamaks, on the plasma response to the resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) fields produced by these coils. Toroidal computations show that both of the plasma response based figures of merit - one is the pitch resonant radial field component near the plasma edge and the other is the plasma displacement near the X-point of the separatrix - consistently yield the same prediction for the optimal coil geometry. With a couple of exceptions, the presently designed poloidal location of the ITER upper and <b>lower</b> <b>rows</b> of RMP coils is close to the optimum, according to the plasma response based criteria. This holds for different coil current configurations with n = 2, 3, 4, as well as different coil phasing between the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>rows.</b> The coils poloidal width from the present design, on the other hand, is sub-optimal for the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>rows.</b> Modelling also finds that the plasma response amplitude sharply decreases by moving the middle row RMP coils of ITER from the designed radial location (just inside the inner vacuum vessel) outwards (outside the outer vacuum vessel). The decay rate is sensitively affected by the middle row coils' poloidal coverage for low-n (n = 1, 2) RMP fields, but not for high-n (n = 4) fields...|$|R
60|$|In a dark {{niche in}} the outer wall of the outer {{corridor}} of St. Mark's--not even in the church, observe, but in the atrium or porch of it, and {{on the north side}} of the church,--is a solid sarcophagus of white marble, raised only about two feet from the ground on four stunted square pillars. Its lid is a mere slab of stone; on its extremities are sculptured two crosses; in front of it are two rows of rude figures, the uppermost representing Christ with the Apostles: the <b>lower</b> <b>row</b> is of six figures only, alternately male and female, holding up their hands in the usual attitude of benediction; the sixth is smaller than the rest, and the midmost of the other five has a glory round its head. I cannot tell the meaning of these figures, but between them are suspended censers attached to crosses; a most beautiful symbolic expression of Christ's mediatorial function. The whole is surrounded by a rude wreath of vine leaves, proceeding out of the foot of a cross.|$|E
60|$|This easy {{method of}} {{classification}} has much power. For example, the four possible kinds of simple spirals (see the 1st, 2nd, and the 5th and 6th diagrams {{in the lowest}} row of Plate 11, Fig. 17) are wholly determined by the letters oj, jo, ij, ji respectively. The two forms of duplex spirals are similarly determined by oi and io (see 4th and 5th diagrams in the upper row of Fig. 17), the two slopes of loops by oo and ii (3rd and 4th in the <b>lower</b> <b>row).</b> It also shows very distinctly the sources whence the streams of ridges proceed that feed the pattern, which itself affords another basis for classification. The resource against uncertainty in respect to ambiguous or difficult patterns is to compile a dictionary of them, with the heads under which it is advisable that they should severally be classed. It would load these pages too heavily to give such a dictionary here. Moreover, {{it ought to be}} revised by many experienced eyes, and the time is hardly ripe for this; when it is, it would be no difficult task, out of the large number of prints of separate fingers which for instance I possess (some 15,000), to make an adequate selection, to enlarge them photographically, and finally to print the results in pairs, the one untouched, the other outlined and classified.|$|E
6000|$|On {{reaching}} the hither {{side of the}} river, I soon struck upon {{the ruins of the}} theatre of Marcellus, which are very picturesque, and the more so from being closely linked in, indeed, identified with the shops, habitations, and swarming life of modern Rome. The most striking portion was a circular edifice, which seemed to have been composed of a row of Ionic columns standing upon a <b>lower</b> <b>row</b> of Doric, many of the antique pillars being yet perfect; but the intervening arches built up with brickwork, and the whole once magnificent structure now tenanted by poor and squalid people, as thick as mites within the round of an old cheese. From this point I cannot very clearly trace out my course; but I passed, I think, between the Circus Maximus and the Palace of the Caesars, and near the Baths of Caracalla, and went into the cloisters of the Church of San Gregorio. All along I saw massive ruins, not particularly picturesque or beautiful, but huge, mountainous piles, chiefly of brickwork, somewhat tweed-grown here and there, but oftener bare and dreary. [...] . All the successive ages since Rome began to decay have done their best to ruin the very ruins by taking away the marble and the hewn stone for their own structures, and leaving only the inner filling up of brickwork, which the ancient architects never designed to be seen. The consequence of all this is, that, except for the lofty and poetical associations connected with it, and except, too, for the immense difference in magnitude, a Roman ruin may be in itself not more picturesque than I have seen an old cellar, with a shattered brick chimney half crumbling down into it, in New England.|$|E
