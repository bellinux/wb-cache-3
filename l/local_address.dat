5|$|Main {{memory in}} a {{parallel}} computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or distributed memory (in which each processing element has its own <b>local</b> <b>address</b> space). Distributed memory refers {{to the fact that}} the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.|$|E
500|$|The {{company was}} {{probably}} founded in 1874 (its first {{mention in the}} <b>local</b> <b>address</b> book) as Gebrüder Helfmann, Bauunternehmer by the Kelsterbach-born brothers Philipp and Balthasar Helfmann, a lumber merchant and mechanic respectively, in Bornheim near Frankfurt am Main. While Balthasar focused on the completion of construction contracts, Philipp developed the financing side of the business. Their first major contract was for the University of Giessen in 1878. By the 1880s the company had begun to produce its own construction materials but was still only a regional player. Shortly {{after the death of}} Balthasar, Philipp converted the company into a joint stock corporation, Aktiengesellschaft [...] für Hoch- und Tiefbauten ("Construction and Civil Engineering Corporation", though literally the [...] "Corporation for High - Hoch and Deep - Tief Construction - Bauten). A major development was the contract for the spa project in Bad Orb in 1899, with the corporation not simply erecting buildings but also to provide infrastructure like roads and gardens, to arrange the finances for the project, and to maintain some responsibilities for operating the project after its construction. Also in 1899, another turnkey project, a new grain silo in Genoa, Italy, was both the firm's first international venture and its first project using reinforced concrete. Philipp Helfmann died in the same year, with his son-in-law, Hans Weidmann, taking over as Chief Executive.|$|E

60|$|The QUEEN’S ELM TURNPIKE, {{pulled down}} in 1848, was {{situated}} here, and took {{its name from}} the tradition that Queen Elizabeth, when walking out, attended by Lord Burleigh, {87a} being overtaken by a heavy shower of rain, found shelter here under an elm-tree. After the rain was over, the queen said, “Let this henceforward be called The Queen’s Tree.” The tradition is strongly supported by the parish records of Chelsea, as mention is made in 1586 (the 28th of Elizabeth, and probably the year of the occurrence), of a tree situated about this spot, “at the end of the Duke’s Walk,” {87b} as “The Queen’s Tree,” around which an arbour was built, or, in other words, nine young elm-trees were planted, by one Bostocke, at the charge of the parish. The first mention of “The Queen’s Elm,” occurs in 1687, ninety-nine years after her Majesty had sheltered beneath the tree around which “an arbour was built,” when the surveyors of the highway were amerced in the sum of five pounds, “for not sufficiently mending the highway from the Queen Elm to the bridge, and from the Elm to Church Lane.” In a plan of Chelsea, from a survey made in 1664 by James Hamilton, and continued to 1717, a tree occupying the spot assigned to “The Queen’s Elm,” is called “The Cross Tree,” and in the vestry minutes it is designated as “The High Elm,” which latter name is used by Sir Hans Sloane in 1727. Bostocke’s arbour, however, had the effect of giving to the cross-road the name of “The Nine Elms.” Steele, on the 22nd June, 1711, writing to his wife, says, “Pray, on the receipt of this, go to the Nine Elms, and I will follow you within an hour.” {88} And so late as 1805, “The Nine Elms, Chelsea,” appeared as a <b>local</b> <b>address</b> in newspaper advertisements.|$|E
