While the changes in consumption baskets and life-style associated with a higher level of development make waste more resource-rich, the demographic (e. g., decline in population growth rate) and economic (e. g., the rise in wage rate and better employment opportunities) changes make resource recovery by the informal sector eventually unviable. In the absence of appropriate public policy and action, this process increases the financial and environmental costs of solid waste management that ultimately poses a serious threat to sustainable urban development. This paper seeks to illustrate this concern with evidence from several cities of Asia...|$|E

Responding to the cali for an increased historical narrative in accounting, we have studied the <b>literature,</b> <b>documentation</b> and personal memoirs concerning circus in Australia. From our examination, we have abstracted and analysed material that expresses, or implies, the use of accounting information. Themes identified include the magnitude and nature of capital investments; ticket pricing and revenues; the nature and composition of operational costs; standards of internal control; insolvencies and liquidations. We have established that, despite elementary levels of education, many circus people exhibited an intuitive grasp of fundamental accounting principles, albeit in a rudimentary form. Nevertheless, since financial and management reporting practises were typically unsystematic, and even non-existent, {{in all but the}} largest circus enterprises, Australian circus management may not have been optimized. 23 page(s...|$|E

Children in Australia have extensive exposure to pornography. Just under three-quarters(73 per cent) of boys and 11 per cent of girls report that they have watched an X-rated video. Eighty-four per cent of boys and 60 per cent of girls say they have been exposed accidentally to sex sites on the Internet and two in five boys deliberately use the Internet to see sexually explicit material, with four to five per cent doing so frequently. In seeing X-rated videos or Internet pornography, young people are exposed to explicit images {{of a wide range of}} sexual acts that are deemed unsuitable viewing for youths under 18. There are special concerns regarding violent and extreme material on the Internet including depictions of non-consenting sexual acts such as rape and bestiality. The research <b>literature’s</b> <b>documentation</b> of significant associations between use of certain types of pornography and sexual aggression provide grounds for real concern. Apart from the intrinsically disturbing nature of much Internet pornography, regular consumption of pornography and particularly violent and extreme pornography is a risk factor for boys’ and young men’s perpetration of sexual assault. In addition, it may foster greater tolerance of this behaviour by others...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of place-based {{conservation}} legislation {{as a tool for}} conflict resolution, wilderness designation and unit-level administrative planning reform on national forests by analyzing the case of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge Partnership in Southwestern Montana. The codification of place-based negotiated compromises over forest management is a significant departure from the administrative planning approach used to resolve multiple-use conflicts by the U. S. Forest Service. The goals of this paper were to develop a place-based legislation typology for natural resources policy, to determine the motivations for seeking this approach, and to analyze its use. Preliminary research for this project was begun in December 2007 by reviewing relevant natural resources policy <b>literature,</b> <b>documentation</b> and legislation. This was followed by in-depth interviews with 13 natural resource policy professionals. These interviews showed that the interest in the place-based conservation legislation approach was primarily due to a frustration over perceived agency “gridlock, ” a desire for increased certainty in the planning process, unresolved wilderness designations, and the need for comprehensive conservation measures in a changing West...|$|E

There were a few cases that services occurred after buildings were built, in such cases of promoting services as pilot projects. 4. There have been always some services in a building, and the services and building usages have continued to change. 5. As reasons, we think that the ‘ZENRINKAN’ is not a merely service provider but a local organization that unifies some services and that they did not use subsidies which restricted change of building usages...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to define {{predictors}} of the passability duration of femoropopliteal bypasses on the basis of both own results and medical <b>literature.</b> <b>Documentation</b> studies and comparative methods were used in the study. The subjects are patients of the Pula General hospital, operated in the Surgical ward in the period between January 1, 1991 and December 31, 2001. Predictors of the passability duration of femoropopliteal bypasses was determined by examination of subjects and the comparison to results found in literature. They can be divided into three groups: predictors of fast bypass occlusion, predictors of longer bypass passability, predictors that do not affect the bypass function. Independent predictors of larger amputations were determined separately. The duration of openness of femoropopliteal bypasses applied to patients suffering from occlusive diseases of the arteries in the femoropopliteal segment can be determined based on the preoperatively established state of the drainage path on lower limbs, on the grade of circulatory insufficiency at the moment of surgery, on the type of femoropoliteal bypass (either by great saphenous vein or by artificial bypass) as well as based on other factors...|$|E
