The development of CRDS was first reported by O’Keefe et al. in 1988. In 1999, Kerstel et al. successfully applied this technique to determine D/H in water sample. The system consists of a laser and a cavity equipped with high finesse reflectivity mirrors. Laser light is injected into the cavity, at which the resonance takes place due to the constructive interference. The laser then is turn off. The decay of light intensity is measured. In the presence of a water sample, the photo-absorption by water isotopologues follows the kinetic law. The optical spectrum is obtained by recording ring-down time of the H2O spectral features of interest at certain laser wavelength. The concentration of each isotopologue is proportional to the area under each measured isotopologue spectral feature.|$|E

40|$|Lead {{compounds}} {{are known}} genotoxicants, principally affecting {{the integrity of}} chromosomes. Lead chloride and lead acetate induced concentration-dependent increases in micronucleus frequency in V 79 cells, starting at 1. 1 μ M lead chloride and 0. 05 μ M lead acetate. The difference between the <b>lead</b> <b>salts,</b> which was expected based on their relative abilities to form complex acetato-cations, was confirmed in an independent experiment. CREST analyses of the micronuclei verified that lead chloride and acetate were predominantly aneugenic (CREST-positive response), which {{was consistent with the}} morphology of the micronuclei (larger micronuclei, compared with micronuclei induced by a clastogenic mechanism). The effects of high concentrations of <b>lead</b> <b>salts</b> on the microtubule network of V 79 cells were also examined using immunofluorescence staining. The dose effects of these responses were consistent with the cytotoxicity of lead(II), as visualized in the neutral-red uptake assay. In a cell-free system, 20 - 60 μ M <b>lead</b> <b>salts</b> inhibited tubulin assembly dose-dependently. The no-observed-effect concentration of lead(II) in this assay was 10 μ M. This inhibitory effect was interpreted as a shift of the assembly/disassembly steady-state toward disassembly, e. g., by reducing the concentration of assembly-competent tubulin dimers. The effects of <b>lead</b> <b>salts</b> on microtubule-associated motor-protein functions were studied using a kinesin-gliding assay that mimics intracellular transport processes in vitro by quantifying the movement of paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules across a kinesin-coated glass surface. There was a dose-dependent effect of lead nitrate on microtubule motility. Lead nitrate affected the gliding velocities of microtubules starting at concentrations above 10 μ M and reached half-maximal inhibition of motility at about 50 μ M. The processes reported here point to relevant interactions of lead with tubulin and kinesin at low dose levels. Environ. Mal. Mutagen. 45 : 346 - 353, 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
