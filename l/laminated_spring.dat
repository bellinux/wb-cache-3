5000|$|High-geared <b>laminated</b> <b>spring</b> steel ‘Rene Thomas’ {{steering}} wheel was used. [...] Only {{one of the}} surviving Sunbeams is so equipped.|$|E
50|$|He {{was given}} {{leave from the}} French Army during World War I so he could {{continue}} to race. <b>Laminated</b> <b>spring</b> steel steering wheel were manufactured in the inter-war period engraved with Rene Thomas portrait and signature and were used particularly on Delage motorcars but also championed by racing ace Jean Chassagne on his winning 1922 TT Sunbeam.|$|E
50|$|The {{buffing gear}} between engine and tender {{consisted}} of a <b>laminated</b> <b>spring,</b> contained in a steel casting attached to the tender's front buffer beam. The tender was the Type JT which was first introduced in 1935 along with the Class 15E Mountain type and Class 16E Pacific type. The tender had a coal capacity of 14 lt t, a water capacity of 6000 imp gal and an axle load of 17 lt 15 lcwt kg.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} the dynamic {{interaction}} between the articulated vehicle and the road surface undulations is investigated using the equivalent linearization technique. The effects of the frictional forces generated in the <b>laminated</b> <b>springs,</b> bump-stops, wheel hop, road characteristics, loading condition and vehicle speed on the ride comfort and road safety are discussed and evaluated.

25|$|The initial design also {{included}} a return to non-fluted coupling rods and <b>laminated</b> <b>springs</b> beneath the leading and driving axleboxes (both features harking back to the 1854 class). The locomotives were also fitted with cast iron chimneys (which had only rarely been fitted to earlier locomotives), and the whistles were fitted {{on top of the}} firebox rather than on top of the cab.|$|R
50|$|Sunbeam Experimental {{department}} modified four 1921 G.P. chassis {{for a team}} {{of three}} cars and a reserve. The weight was reduced, 30 gallon bolster tank fitted, two BTH magnetos replaced the Delco coil ignition, two CZC Claudel Hobson carburettors fitted and compression raised to 6.3 to 1 resulting in 112 bhp. Jean Chassagne also had his signature ‘Rene Thomas’ <b>laminated</b> <b>sprung</b> steel steering wheel.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{laminated}} rubber-metal {{spring has}} been widely applied for earthquake vibration isolation which deals mainly for horizontal motion at a very low frequency input. This article presents {{the effect of a}} vertical vibration input, which is also aimed at applying the <b>laminated</b> <b>spring</b> for high frequency excitation. Static analysis is discussed here using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to observe the stress and strain distribution as well as the safety factor of the isolator due to the axial force. Solid rubber spring experienced greater deformation while it decreased for the laminated rubber-metal spring as more plates were embedded in the rubber. However, higher stress distributions occurred on spring with multiple plates compared to solid rubber and the stress concentrate on steel plate layers. Strain distribution was observed to be high at solid rubber spring and it was decreasing on the laminated rubber-metal spring. The critical part for the strain distribution in the laminated rubber-metal spring was in the rubber layers...|$|E
50|$|The {{load-bearing}} springs of {{the trailing}} bissel consisted of single helical springs of round section. Since the single spring would {{not stand up}} to the load, it was soon replaced by a double <b>spring.</b> <b>Laminated</b> <b>springs</b> were subsequently fitted. Apart from this, the engines were trouble-free and gave more than seventy years of service. After withdrawal, many were sold into industrial service and some of these reached almost 100 years in service.|$|R
50|$|These {{locomotives}} {{were the}} first in South Africa to be equipped with compensated spring gear on all coupled wheels. Their coupling rods extended from crank-pin to crank-pin, with no knuckle joints. The 5 ft wheelbase bogie had a lateral traverse of 1+1/4 in to each side, which was restrained by two cylindrically-shaped rubber cushion pads, each 5+5/8 in in diameter and 5 in deep. Two inverted <b>laminated</b> <b>springs</b> carried the vertical load.|$|R
50|$|The leading {{pony truck}} was of rather complex construction. The weight borne {{on the leading}} wheels was {{transferred}} by a system of beams to a hollow cylindrical plunger, which rested on a rubber pad in a cradle immediately above the truck axle. Instead of a swing beam to control lateral movement, there were two transverse <b>laminated</b> <b>springs,</b> the ends of which were connected to three-point T-headed links. The two upper pins of these links bore on a transverse frame which connected the axle boxes.|$|R
40|$|The {{calculation}} of the nominal torque on the rolls during asymmetric rolling of a strip with small <b>laminated</b> <b>springs</b> are held. To stabilize the rolling process it is proposed to use a front tension and a certain minimum value was calculated. Misalignment of the circumferential speeds of the driving and driven rolls are calculated. The design of a composite roll banded with two tabs on the brace and the two grooves on the shaft are proposed. Crumpling test and shear test of the tabs on the brace were conducted. Necessary structural toughness was provided. </p...|$|R
50|$|The works built {{only one}} {{locomotive}} {{and after the}} merger with the Midland Railway, such work was concentrated at Derby. However it became a well-respected wagon works, using components from Derby, apart from <b>laminated</b> <b>springs</b> which it fabricated itself. It {{became part of the}} LMS and, during World War II the Works Manager initiated a scheme for recovering timber and metal fittings for re-use as spares. After nationalisation in 1949 it remained busy with one of the highest productivity rates, but following a reorganisation of railway workshops, it closed in 1964, with the work being transferred to Derby.|$|R
40|$|Analysis {{of human}} running has {{revealed}} that {{the motion of the}} human leg can be modeled by a compression spring because the joints of the leg behave like a torsion spring in the stance phase. In this paper, we describe the development of a joint mechanism that mimics the elastic characteristics of the joints of the stance leg. The knee was equipped with a mechanism comprising two <b>laminated</b> leaf <b>springs</b> made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic for adjusting the joint stiffness and a worm gear in order to achieve active movement. Using this mechanism, we were able to achieve joint stiffness mimicking that of a human knee joint that can be adjusted by varying the effective length of one of the <b>laminated</b> leaf <b>springs.</b> The equation proposed for calculating the joint stiffness considers the difference between the position of the fixed point of the leaf spring and the position of the rotational center of the joint. We evaluated the performance of the <b>laminated</b> leaf <b>spring</b> and the effectiveness of the proposed equation for joint stiffness. We were able to make a bipedal robot run with one leg using pelvic oscillation for storing energy produced by the resonance related to leg elasticity...|$|R
50|$|The AK3 {{is powered}} by a 58.8 kW (78.9 hp) Rotax 912 UL four {{cylinder}} horizontally opposed engine, housed in the nose under a carbon fibre cowling and driving a three blade propeller. It has a tricycle undercarriage, with glass/carcon fibre <b>laminate</b> cantilever <b>spring</b> main legs mounted onto the fuselage and a trailing link nose wheel on a forward angled cantilever leg. The mainwheels have hydraulic brakes and all wheels are faired.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the Mullins {{effect on the}} <b>laminated</b> rubber-metal <b>spring</b> analytically modeled using lumped parameter system. The general form of the equation is developed to represent the multi-degree-of-freedom system for N layer of embedded metal plates. The Mullins effect can be observed when a compression load {{is applied to the}} spring. It is shown that by increasing the embedded metal plate, the Mullins effect inside the rubber is reduced due to the improved stiffness in vertical direction...|$|R
50|$|When the Class 12 was introduced, it was {{the largest}} non-articulated engine in South Africa and {{possibly}} in the world on railways of less than 4 ft gauge. The first eight locomotives had cast steel frames for the leading bogies with three-point suspension links, {{similar to those of the}} Class 3B. On subsequent engines, this arrangement was modified to the two-point swing-link type controlled by <b>laminated</b> side <b>springs,</b> a design Hendrie adhered to in all his later engines.|$|R
50|$|The tender was {{equipped}} with a mechanical stoker. The water tank was of welded construction and the coal bunker was of the self-trimming design. Each Bissel truck was compensated with two pairs of rigidly mounted wheels. The eight rigidly mounted wheels were fitted with overhead <b>laminated</b> bearing <b>springs</b> while the spring gear for each pony truck and two adjacent axles were compensated throughout the springing system, constituting two equal groups. Vacuum cylinders mounted {{on top of the}} tank actuated brake blocks on the rigidly mounted wheels.|$|R
50|$|A {{leaf spring}} {{is a simple}} form of spring {{commonly}} used for the suspension in wheeled vehicles. Originally called a <b>laminated</b> or carriage <b>spring,</b> and {{sometimes referred to as}} a semi-elliptical spring or cart spring, {{it is one of the}} oldest forms of springing, dating back to medieval times.|$|R
50|$|The tail {{surfaces}} of the Vittoria were constructed, like the wings, with ply covering. The horizontal surfaces were mounted at mid-fuselage, though the tailplane was vestigial, more like a long fillet which carried large, balanced elevators with curved leading edges. The fin was broad and noticeably upswept, bearing a very broad, rounded rudder. Its undercarriage was fixed and conventional, {{with a pair of}} faired-in, wood and ply inverted L-struts on either side carrying a rubber cord sprung steel single axle, fitted with large diameter wheels. The steel-shod tailskid was mounted on a <b>laminated</b> ash <b>spring.</b>|$|R
50|$|The tender was {{equipped}} with a mechanical stoker. The water tank was of welded construction and the coal bunker was of the self-trimming design. Each Bissel truck was compensated with its neighbouring two pairs of rigidly mounted wheels. The eight rigidly mounted wheels were fitted with overhead <b>laminated</b> bearing <b>springs,</b> while the spring gear for each pony truck and two adjacent axles were compensated throughout the springing system, constituting two equal groups. Vacuum cylinders, mounted {{on top of the}} tank, actuated brake blocks on the rigidly mounted wheels.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the sustainable of <b>laminated</b> rubber-metal <b>spring</b> (LR-MS) in transverse vibration. The free-fixed boundary condition, longitudinal and rotational force are chosen to re{{presents the}} transverse {{behavior of the}} LR-MS model. The mathematical model is developed and finally the dynamic stiffness matrix for all elements inside the LR-MS are obtained. By using the dynamic stiffness matrix for each element in LR-MS model, the prediction of stiffness level during transverse vibration are determined. Furthermore, it was pointed the comparison of stiffness level between all elements when the forces apply. Finally, the mathematical model developed {{in this study is}} accomplished to represent the stiffness level of LR-MS model in actual value when transverse vibration occurred...|$|R
50|$|The outer bogies had two-pin swing {{links and}} <b>laminated</b> side control <b>springs</b> which {{provided}} {{for a total}} side-play of 7 in. The outer pairs of bogie wheels were arranged with tyre flange watering gear. The inner bissel trucks were of the radial-arm type with helical spring side control and a total side-play of 4 in. The bogies and bissels both had Timken roller bearing axle boxes. The front engine unit had two 21 in diameter vacuum brake cylinders, while the hind engine units were provided with steam and hand brakes.|$|R
40|$|The {{leaf springs}} {{are widely used}} in {{suspension}} system of railway carriages and automobiles. But the form {{in which it is}} normally seen is <b>laminated</b> leaf <b>spring.</b> To assure proper spring life, the maintenance and inspection process must include the entire suspension system of springs and chassis parts. The motoring public has learned that proper maintenance on their vehicles is essential to obtain longer life and economical service in this age of rising equipment and fuel costs. In most normal maintenance checks, the spring suspension system is sorely overlooked, but a minimum of attention to the spring suspension would yield a longer and more reliable suspension system service. In this report,FEM approach has used for predicting the stress and deformation. A parametric study is also made by varying the load to investigate their effect on the stress of leaf spring. A frequency response graph is plotted to analyse the effect of Stress, Strain and Deformation...|$|R
50|$|A {{feature in}} the design of the leading bogie was that the bogie frame was a single steel casting to which the cast steel horns were bolted to take the axle boxes. An {{innovation}} was the arrangement of the <b>laminated</b> side control <b>springs</b> in combination with two point swing links, which would be part of all Hendrie's subsequent designs. To prevent trouble which had been experienced earlier owing to the fracture of the smokebox saddle and frame stretcher castings which contained steam chest passages, and also leakage at exhaust joints, the blast pipe breeches were made separate castings and not integral with the centre stretcher casting.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Finite-Element model (FEM) for {{simulating}} the behaviour of RC beams strengthened by Mechanically Fastened FRP laminates (MF-FRP). The model is developed by assembling a frame-like element {{to simulate the}} RC beam, a “rod” element for the external FRP <b>laminate</b> and two <b>springs</b> to connect the above elements. Well-established stress-strain laws are considered for simulating the nonlinear behaviour of both RC beams and FRP laminates, while the force-slip relationship describing {{the behavior of the}} two springs is calibrated on the results of direct-shear tests on MF-FRP laminates performed by the authors and already published in other papers. The proposed FEM model is validated by comparing the numerical simulations with results of some experimental tests available in the literature...|$|R
40|$|As known, the {{electrical}} induced strain of conventional piezoceramic materials {{is limited by}} 0. 12 % (2 kV/mm), which often requires strain transformation designs, like levers, {{in order to meet}} application needs. High fabrication accuracy and low tolerances are crucial points in mechanical manufacturing causing high device costs. Therefore, we developed a piezoelectric composite actuator with inherent stress - strain transformation. Basically, piezoceramic sheets are <b>laminated</b> with <b>spring</b> steel of a certain curvature, which can be realised by a comparatively simple fabrication technique. The working diagram of these composite bow actuators showed a high level of performance adaptable {{to a wide range of}} applications. The authors established the value chain covering the piezoceramic formulation, the processing technology and the design in view of optimum system performance. The paper presents an overview of the design principles, simulation and various aspect of fabrication technology including lamination, sintering and polarization. The new devices are useable in different sectors, for example in automotive industry as solid state transducer or as the active part in injectors. Moreover, the composite bow actuators may find application in microsystems technology, micro optics and micro fluidics as well as vibration dampers. The composite bow actuators can be used as single component transducer, as well as multi-bow actuator in series or parallel combination on demand...|$|R
5000|$|Nicholas Wood {{was born}} at Sourmires, in the parish of Ryton, then in County Durham, the son of Nicholas and Ann (née Laws) Wood. Nicholas Senior was the mining {{engineer}} at Crawcrook colliery. Nicholas Junior attended the village school at Crawcrook and started work in 1811 at Killingworth Colliery as an apprentice colliery viewer {{under the guidance of}} Ralph Dodds. Wood eventually became the viewer, or colliery manager, of Killingworth Colliery in 1815. He was there a close associate of the colliery enginewright George Stephenson, helping him develop his version of the safety lamp and making considerable technical contributions to the development of his locomotive Blücher. Early in their career, George Stephenson began developing a revolutionary safety lamp, yet it was Wood, already an accomplished craftsmen, who made the drawing to which the [...] "Geordie" [...] lamp was made, {{under the supervision of the}} inventor. It was Nicholas Wood who actually designed the system of actuating the valves of Stephenson's Blücher with eccentrics added to the axle; most of the valve gears, including, ironically, the Stephenson Gear, were based on the use of eccentrics, however, not on the simple slip eccentrics of Wood. He also carried out in 1818 a series of experiments on rolling resistance, lubrication and <b>laminated</b> steel <b>springs</b> of locomotives. In 1823 he accompanied Stephenson to the meeting with Edward Pease in Darlington at which Pease was convinced to use locomotives on the Stockton and Darlington Railway and put Stephenson in charge of building it. Wood and Stephenson remained in close contact throughout their lives, and George Stephenson even sent his son, Robert Stephenson, to work as Wood's apprentice, where he flourished.|$|R
