5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures <b>look</b> <b>much</b> like humans, and {{are about the}} same size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just {{below the surface of the}} water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E
5|$|Johansson {{learned some}} Russian {{from a former}} teacher {{on the phone for}} her role of Black Widow in The Avengers (2012), another entry from the MCU. The film {{received}} positive reviews and broke many box office records, becoming the third highest-grossing film both in the United States and worldwide. For her performance, she was nominated for two Teen Choice Awards and three People's Choice Awards. Later that year, Johansson portrayed the actress Janet Leigh in Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock, a behind-the-scenes drama about the making of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho. Roger Ebert believed that Johansson did not <b>look</b> <b>much</b> like Leigh, but conveyed her spunk, intelligence, and sense of humor.|$|E
5|$|Shortened {{forms of}} this life cycle are common, for example some oceanic scyphozoans omit the polyp stage completely, and cubozoan polyps produce only one medusa. Hydrozoa {{have a variety of}} life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. hydra) have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain {{attached}} to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not <b>look</b> <b>much</b> like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual reproduction process, was observed in both Hydrozoa (Turritopsis dohrnii and Laodicea undulata) and Scyphozoa (Aurelia sp.1). Anthozoa have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{special effects}} were {{supervised}} by RKO department head Vernon L. Walker. Welles pioneered several visual effects to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, {{the scene in}} which the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters, to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for Susan Alexander Kane's performance, was shot by a camera craning upwards over the performance scene, then a curtain wipe to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with {{the scene of the}} workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film <b>look</b> <b>much</b> more expensive than it truly was, such as various shots of Xanadu.|$|E
5|$|Edwards' next {{fraudulent}} scheme involved forging {{letters to}} cotton brokers in New Orleans, {{and using the}} signatures obtained from their replies to forge letters to brokers in New York City, saying that the fake John Caldwell– Edwards' alias– had {{a large amount of}} cotton on deposit with the New Orleans brokers. Edwards used those letters to secure fraudulent loans from brokers on the security of the non-existent cotton. Two New York brokers– Brown Bros. & Co. and Jacob Little– gave Edwards bank drafts for $25,000 each. Edwards then cashed the drafts pretending to be Caldwell, but without attempting to disguise his appearance. Unluckily for Edwards, in September 1841 Brown Brothers was informed by the New Orleans brokers that there was no cotton on account for Caldwell, and this prompted the bankers to offer a reward for information on the forger. The police began to search for the forger of the letters, but were unsuccessful until Edwards attempted to distract their attention to an acquaintance, Alexander Powell, who happened to <b>look</b> <b>much</b> like him. Edwards sent an anonymous letter to the New York police, stating that the forger they were hunting was sailing to England, as Powell was about to do. Edwards assumed that by the time the police acted, Powell's ship would already have sailed. The ship was delayed and the police were able to catch Powell, who told them that Edwards was their forger.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} {{hypotheses}} have been discredited or rejected. For example, {{there is no}} hole {{at the end of}} the crest for a snorkeling function. There are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would need one. As a proposed airlock, it would not have kept out water. The proposed air reservoir would have been insufficient for an animal the size of Parasaurolophus. Other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments. Also, none of the proposals explain why the crest has such a shape, why other lambeosaurines should have crests that <b>look</b> <b>much</b> different but perform a similar function, how crestless or solid-crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities, or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests. These considerations particularly impact hypotheses based on increasing the capabilities of systems already present in the animal, such as the salt gland and olfaction hypotheses, and indicate that these were not primary functions of the crest. Additionally, work on the nasal cavity of lambeosaurines shows that olfactory nerves and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside the portion of the nasal passages in the crest, so the expansion of the crest had little to do with the sense of smell.|$|E

B. schlegelii occurs {{in a wide range}} of colors, including red, yellow, brown, green, even pink, as well as various combinations thereof. It often has black or brown speckling on the base color. No external features distinguish the two sexes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} 1980s, {{things began to}} <b>look</b> <b>much</b> more {{positive}} for the genre. After disbandment, Fairport’s Cropredy Festival went from strength to strength growing to a regular 20,000 fans a year, and when they reformed in 1985 {{they were able to}} embark on increasingly successful tours and produce a series of highly regarded albums. The reason for this recording revival was partly because they abandoned the mainstream record business, instead focusing on growing their own audience and producing records through their own labels (Woodworm and Matty Grooves).|$|E
25|$|At least some, if not all, of the Indonesian ships have {{replaced}} their Seacat launchers with two twin Simbad launchers.

Centrifugal compressors for such uses are often one-shaft multi-stage and driven by large steam or gas turbines. Their casings are often termed horizontally split or barrel.

25|$|In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake {{looks more}} like the hen; it is more uniform in colour, with a dark head and vestigial facial markings. The hen itself is yellowish-brown, {{somewhat}} darker on wings and back. It has a dark greyish-brown upper head, hindneck, eyestripe and feather pattern. The pattern is dense short streaks {{on the head and}} neck, and scaly spots {{on the rest of the}} body; overall they <b>look</b> <b>much</b> like a tiny mallard (A. platyrhynchos) hen when at rest. The wings are coloured similar to the drake's, but with brown instead of grey upperwing coverts that have less wide tips, and wider tips of the speculum feathers. The hen's rectrices have yellowish-white tips; the midbelly is whitish with some dark streaking.|$|E

25|$|The 2016-17 Colts roster would <b>look</b> <b>much</b> {{different}} from the one the previous year. One hundred point scorers Kevin Labanc and Andrew Magiapane had moved on to their respective AHL and NHL clubs. Mackenzie Blackwood would not return in goal. Also not returning was defensemen Michael Webster, Rasmus Andersson and Greg DiTomasso, and forwards Justin Scott, Keigan Goetz, Dylan Sadoway, and Julius Nattinen. The youth movement was on, as signaled by the blockbuster trade made preseason where the Colts sent a package including 10 draft picks to the Mississauga Steelheads in exchange for 16-year old Russian Kirill Niznikov. The Colts season would be a tough one, having them spend the majority {{of the year in the}} basement of the league. Come trade deadline the Colts were active, trading captain Cordell James to the Owen Sound Attack, Cameron Lizotte to the Erie Otters, and Barrie native Matt Brassard to the Oshawa Generals while acquiring Robert Proner and Jason Smith from the Saginaw Spirit and Mississauga Steelheads. The Colts would finish off the year with the youngest roster in the OHL and finishing last place overall in the league. A number one overall draft pick was in their future.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of other subspecies, some of which may have arisen because of partial {{geographical}} isolation, such as the resident British form, the pied wagtail M. a. yarrellii, which now also breeds in adjacent areas of the neighbouring European mainland. The pied wagtail, named for naturalist William Yarrell, exchanges the grey colour of the nominate form with black (or very dark grey in females), but is otherwise identical in its behaviour. Other subspecies, the validity of some of which is questionable, differ in the colour of the wings, back, and head, or other features. Some races show sexual dimorphism during the breeding season. As many as six subspecies may be present in the wintering ground in India or Southeast Asia and here they can be difficult to distinguish. Phylogenetic studies using mtDNA suggest that some morphological features have evolved more than once, including the back and chin colour. Breeding M. a. yarrellii <b>look</b> <b>much</b> like the nominate race except for the black back, and M. a. alboides of the Himalayas differs from the Central Asian M. a. personata only by its black back. M. a. personata has been recorded breeding in the Siddar Valley of Kashmir of the Western Himalayas. It has also been noted that both back and chin change colour during the pre-basic moult; all black-throated subspecies develop white chins and throats in winter and some black-backed birds are grey-backed in winter.|$|E
