The French government outlawed the Forsane Alizza organization because it was encouraging citizens to travel to Afghanistan to fight jihad. The lawyer for the group, speaking after the shootings, denied claims that the leader of the group had any connections with Merah. French intelligence described Merah as having the [...] "ability to travel and furnish <b>logistic</b> <b>assistance</b> to other militants."

There were also New Zealand Government non-military requests such as <b>logistic</b> <b>assistance</b> to trade delegations, the attendance of the band at receptions, support to the local school and a host of sporting engagements. NZAOD support to the force developed over the years and at its peak the strength of the depot was over 100 personnel. This number was made up of approximately 25 military personnel, including a small group of female staff, and more than 75 civilians. The majority of the LECs came direct from service with the British forces, and they brought with them a lot of experience.

5000|$|Humanitarian aid is {{material}} and <b>logistic</b> <b>assistance</b> {{to people who}} need help. It is usually short-term help until the long-term help by government and other institutions replaces it. A report published by the network of European Universities on Professionalization of Humanitarian Action noted that humanitarian aid is a [...] "fundamental expression of the universal value of solidarity between people and a moral imperative." [...] Among the people in need belong homeless, refugees, victims of natural disasters, wars and famines. The primary purpose of humanitarian aid is to save lives, reduce suffering and respect to human dignity. Humanitarian aid is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises including natural disasters and man-made disaster. The primary objective of humanitarian aid is to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity. It may therefore be distinguished from development aid, which seeks to address the underlying socioeconomic factors which {{may have led to}} a crisis or emergency.|$|E

This paper argues that alternatives (alt-) questions involve ellipsis and provides a compositional semantics for the proposed structures. Two arguments for ellipsis are presented. First, alt-readings need a particular focus intonation pattern on the disjuncts, comparable to that in other elliptical constructions. Second, alt-readings are lost when we have inverted negation or an extra focus on the polarity; we derive this effect from the interaction of the licensing conditions of focus and ellipsis. ...|$|E

40|$|Risk {{occurrence}} usually leads {{not only}} to damages at relevant enterprises but causes further risks at other supply chain partners. Consequently, more and more enterprises force their partners, particularly small and medium sized enterprises, to make statements regarding their risks and provisions, especially regarding the fulfilment of specific orders which {{are at high risk}} due to fluctuating system load. Currently, there are no applicable tools and methods known to assess risks quantitatively as well as their interdependencies from a supply chain perspective based on orders regarding the probability of adherence to schedules.

40|$|Antarctica {{remains the}} {{continent}} with least access to humans {{due to its}} harsh weather condition and remoteness from human civilization. However, the major heat sink effect and its critical role in balancing world climate have made Antarctica an important continent to monitor and understand constantly. Due to its remoteness and wide area coverage, remote sensing technology is suitable to be utilized for such purposes. As the majority parts of Antarctia are covered by ice and snow, {{it is necessary to}} model the ice and snow media for microwave scattering analysis to interpret from the data. In this paper, a theorethical model is developed to model the sea ice and ice shelf areas in Antarctica by treating them as layers of random discrete medium with scatterers embedded in the host medium. The Dense Medium Phase and Amplitude Correction Theory (DMPACT) which takes into account the close spacing effect among the scatterers is applied to the sea and snow medium [1]. The air-snow interface and snow-sea interface are modelled using Integral Equation Method (IEM) with the consideration of surface multiple scattering effect [2]. This scattering problem of an electrically dense medium such as sea ice and ise shelf is solved using the Radiative Transfer Theory. Gound truth measurement trips were conducted in the years of 2002 - 2004 at Ross Island, Antarctica with <b>logistic</b> <b>assistance</b> of Antarctica New Zealand to measure the physical parameters of the sea ice, ice shelf and sea water, which were then used in theorethical model calculation.

In the theorethical analysis, a study of the physical paraneters affecting the backscattering returns and the major scattering mechanisms involveds is carried out and the analysis is presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{state of}} {{conservation}} of the traditional cultures of Northwest Argentina is variable and somewhat problematic but to a lesser or a greater extent all the peoples are related to an hegemonic culture. We present a case study {{carried out in the}} rural communities of the Yungas biome (Salta) where the extent of isolation varies as does the type of access to public health services. The use of medicinal plants in the area is ordinary and widely spread. Methods The data can be organized in two categories, as medical systems public records (for the regional hospital at Los Toldos), and as ethnobotanical sets. A total of 59 surveys to 40 interviewees were undertaken using a semi structured questionnaire. We present an analysis of the relative importance of the medicinal herbs used in reproductive medicine considering the plants used in the traditional medical system and the factors that can affect the relationship between formal medicine and patients. We further analized how the degree of accessibility to the local hospital influences the diversity of use of plant species used to assist deliveries and to decrease infant mortality in children minor than one year of age. Results In reproductive medicine, 13 ailments and/or different physiological states are locally identified and treated. Local population uses 108 ethnospecies for this kind of illnesses. According to the local conception the hot/cold imbalance could be the principal cause for reproductive illnesses; pregnancy may have natural or supernatural origin, post partum and menstruation involve similar sanitary risks, and neonatal care has a strong magic connotation. In relation with the formal medicine, the more accessible is the health center the more women assist to it. We have not found a relation between accessibility and infant mortality. Conclusion In the local reproductive medicine, most of the practices are concerned with the hot/cold balance. According to their importance the factors involved are: the family medicine, the midwife, and the formal doctors. Plants have an important role; however {{there is a lack of}} total agreement among the families who use them. Reluctance to institutional deliveries may be due to the weak relationship between patients and doctors, and the lack of <b>logistic</b> <b>assistance</b> to delivering mothers coming from far away locations. </p...|$|E

Some qualitative estimation methods of terpenoids in plant tissue have been previously described {{but there is no}} protocol of estimating the same quantitatively till date. In the present study a protocol has been attempted to estimate the total terpenoids concentration of different resin producing plants using a monoterpene, Linalool as standard reagent. ### Introduction Terpenes and terpenoids are the primary {{constituents of}} the essential oils of many types of plants and flowers. These compounds belong to the isoprenoid group. Even though isoprene itself has not been found in nature, its polymers, terpenic hydrocarbons and their oxygen derivatives are very often present in large quantities in different plant species. The resin produced by most plants is a viscous liquid, composed mainly of volatile fluid terpene 3. The single isoprene unit, therefore, represents the most basic class of terpenes, the hemiterpenes. An isoprene unit bound to a second isoprene is the defining characteristic of terpene, which is also a monoterpene (C 10). Sesquiterpenes contain three isoprene units (C 15), while diterpenes (C 20) and triterpenes (C 30) contain two and three terpene units respectively. Tetraterpenes consist of four terpene units, polyterpenes more than four such units. In nature, terpenes occur predominantly in the form of hydrocarbons, alcohols and their glycosides, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters. Apart from broad structural diversity, terpenes also exhibit a wide array of biological actions. Essential oils have antimicrobial, antiparasitic, insecticidal and antioxidant/prooxidant activities that often represent the combined bioactivity of multiple components 10. Many plant terpenoids are cytotoxic towards tumour cells and are applied as chemotherapeutic or chemo-preventive compounds 1, 2. Terpenes play an important role as signal compounds and growth regulators (phytohormones) of plants 10. Many insects metabolize the terpenes which they may have obtained from their plant food for synthesizing growth hormones and pheromones 10. Many plant and insect resins like Lac resin also have economically beneficial properties, useful for varnishes and adhesives 4. This protocol describes a rapid, small-scale, high-throughput assay for approximating the total terpenoids content in plant tissue using a monoterpene, Linalool as standard reagent with conc. sulfuric acid. In this reaction Geraniol (primary alcohol, C 10 H 18 O) may be produced from Linalool (Tertiary alcohol, C 10 H 18 O). Alpha-terpineol (C 10 H 18 O) or such monocyclic terpenoids may further be produced from geraniole 3. It is very obscured to explain the exact chemical nature of the reaction in where a brick red precipitation has been formed and which is partially soluble in reaction mixture solution and chloroform but fully in methanol. All estimation has been done spectroscopically at 538 nm. ### Reagents 1. Methanol (Sigma, Cat. No. M 3641) - Sulfuric Acid (Sigma, Cat. No. 320501) - Chloroform (Sigma, Cat. No. C 2432) - Linalool (Sigma, Cat. No. L 2602) ### Equipment 1. Colorimeter - Mixer mill disrupter with adaptor sets for 2 ml tubes (Qiagen tissue lyser) or Mortar & pestle. ### Procedure 1. Harvest plant material (approximately 500 mg.) in screw-capped tubes & freeze immediately in liquid Nitrogen. [Sample must be stored at - 80 ⁰ C for 1 - 2 months but fresh sample must be preferred] - To homogenize the tissue, place three tungsten Carbide beads & 3. 5 ml of ice-cold 95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol in each sample tube & insert sample into pre-cooled teflon adaptors. Homogenized tissue for 5 minutes at 30 Hz. If a mixture mill is not available tissue can be homogenized in an ice-cold mortar & pestle. - Remove tungsten carbide beads with a magnet & incubate the sample at room temperature for 48 h in dark. - Centrifuge the samples (4000 g for 15 min. at room temperature) & collect the supernatant in a fresh 2 ml micro-tube. - Add 1. 5 ml Chloroform in each 2 ml microcentrifuge tube & then add 200 µl sample supernatant in each. REMARK For the standard curve 200 µl of previously prepared Linalool solution in methanol will be added to 1. 5 ml Chloroform & serial dilution must be done[dilution level- 100 mg/ 200 µl to 1 mg/ 200 µl (12. 965 µM- 1. 296 µM) Linalool Conc. In case of serial dilution total volume of 200 µl will be make up by addition of 95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol]. - Vortex the sample mixture thoroughly & take the time 3 min to rest. - Add 100 µl Conc. Sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) to each 2 ml microcentrifuge tube. - CRITICAL STEP If heat generation occurs then the entire system must be cooled by using ice-pad but not more than 15 min. - Then the assay tube must be incubated at room temperature for 1. 5 h- 2 h in dark. - PAUSE POINT For standard solution (Linalool) incubate not more than 5 minutes and during incubation time the microcentrifuge tube must not be disturbed. - At the end of incubation time a reddish brown precipitation will be formed in each assay microcentrifuge tube. Then carefully & gently decant all supernatant reaction mixture liquid with-out disturbing the precipitation. - CRITICAL STEP The reddish brown precipitation is partially soluble in reaction mixture solution so must gently decant the supernatant fluid. - Add 1. 5 ml of 95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol & vortex thoroughly until all the precipitation dissolve in Methanol completely. - Transfer the sample from assay tube to Colorimetric cuvette [95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol will be used as blank] to read the absorbance at 538 nm. Total Terpenoid Calculation 12. Calculate a standard curve from the blank-corrected at wave length at 538 nm of the Linalool standard (Fig. 1). Calculate total terpenoids concentration of unknown plant sample as Linalool equivalents using the regression equation of Linalool standard curve. ### Troubleshooting Terpenoids content varies considerably among leaf and bark tissue and also with environmental and biological stress 8, 11. In the design of this experiment we advise the use of multiple biological and technical replicates, in order to minimize the sample errors (Table 1). Different incubation time should be tried with each plant species and tissue to optimize the assay. Automated liquid handling system may also significantly increase throughput and improve results 6. Most probably sulfuric acid rearranged the linalool and the tertiary alcoholic group reduces to primary alcohol for which the solubility of reaction product has been reduced to chloroform. It is very important to note that sulfuric acid not only reacts to terpenoids but also it may react with methanolic extract of plant tissue samples having plant phenolics and alkaloids. ### Anticipated Results Some qualitative estimation methods of terpenoids in plant tissues have been previously described and widely used 9. The quantitative analytical colorimetric method of total terpenoids concentration in plants as suggested in this protocol can be used to estimate the total terpenoids of different resin producing plants. ### References 1.
