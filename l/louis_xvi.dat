5|$|Until his {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of France, he held the title of Count of Provence as brother of King <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI.</b> On 21 September 1792, the National Convention abolished the monarchy and deposed <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI,</b> who was later executed by guillotine. When the little boy Louis XVII, Louis XVI's 10 year-old-son, died in prison in June 1795, Louis XVIII, then in his 40th year, succeeded his nephew as titular King.|$|E
5|$|Provence {{urged the}} king to act {{strongly}} against the declaration, while the king's popular minister Jacques Necker intended to {{compromise with the}} new assembly. <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI</b> was characteristically indecisive. On 9 July, the assembly declared itself a National Constituent Assembly that would give France a Constitution. On 11 July, <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI</b> dismissed Necker, which led to widespread rioting across Paris. On 12 July, the sabre charge of the cavalry regiment of Charles-Eugène de Lorraine, prince de Lambesc, on a crowd gathered at the Tuileries gardens, sparked the Storming of the Bastille two days later.|$|E
5|$|When the Count of Provence {{arrived in}} the Low Countries, he proclaimed himself de facto regent of France. He {{exploited}} a document that he and <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI</b> had written before the latter's failed escape to Varennes. The document gave him the regency {{in the event of}} his brother's death or inability to perform his role as king. He would join the other princes-in-exile at Coblenz soon after his escape. It was there that he, the Count of Artois, and the Condés proclaimed that their objective was to invade France. <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI</b> was greatly annoyed by his brothers' behaviour. Provence sent emissaries to various European courts asking for financial aid, soldiers, and munition. Artois secured a castle for the court in exile in the Electorate of Treves, where their maternal uncle, Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, was the Archbishop-Elector. The activities of the émigrés bore fruit when the rulers of Prussia and the Holy Roman Empire gathered at Dresden. They released the Declaration of Pillnitz in August 1791, which urged Europe to intervene in France if <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI</b> or his family were threatened. Provence's endorsement of the declaration was not well received in France, either by the ordinary citizens or <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI</b> himself.|$|E

5|$|An Assembly of Notables (the members {{consisted}} of magistrates, mayors, nobles and clergy) was convened in February 1787 {{to ratify the}} financial reforms sought by the Controller-General of Finance Charles Alexandre de Calonne. This provided the Count of Provence, who abhorred the radical reforms proposed by Calonne, the opportunity he had long been waiting for to establish himself in politics. The reforms proposed a new property tax, and new elected provincial assemblies {{that would have a}} say in local taxation. Calonne's proposition was rejected outright by the notables, and, as a result, <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI</b> dismissed him. The Archbishop of Toulouse, Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne, acquired Calonne's ministry. Brienne attempted to salvage Calonne's reforms, but ultimately failed to convince the notables to approve them. A frustrated <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI</b> dissolved the assembly.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 1783, Pitt, Wilberforce and Edward Eliot (later {{to become}} Pitt's brother-in-law), {{travelled}} to France for a six-week holiday together. After a difficult start in Rheims, where their presence aroused police suspicion {{that they were}} English spies, they visited Paris, meeting Benjamin Franklin, General Lafayette, Marie Antoinette and <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI,</b> and joined the French court at Fontainebleau.|$|E
5|$|His father Nobile Carlo Buonaparte was an attorney, and {{was named}} Corsica's {{representative}} {{to the court of}} <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI</b> in 1777. The dominant influence of Napoleon's childhood was his mother, Letizia Ramolino, whose firm discipline restrained a rambunctious child. Napoleon's maternal grandmother had married into the Swiss Fesch family in her second marriage, and Napoleon's uncle, the cardinal Joseph Fesch, would fulfill a role as protector of the Bonaparte family for some years.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1760s in Paris the first Parisian neoclassical chairs were made, {{even before the}} {{accession}} of <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI,</b> whose name {{is attached to the}} first phases of the style. Straight tapering fluted legs joined by a block at the seat rail and architectural mouldings, characterize the style, in which each element is a discrete entity. Louis Delanois, Jean-Claude Sené and Georges Jacob were three leading chairmakers in the 1770s and 80s.|$|E
5|$|Louis Stanislas lived a {{quiet and}} {{sedentary}} lifestyle at this point, {{not having a}} great deal to do since his self-proclaimed political exclusion in 1774. He kept himself occupied with his vast library of over 11,000 books at Balbi's pavilion, reading for several hours each morning. In the early 1780s, he also incurred huge debts totalling 10million livres, which his brother <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI</b> paid.|$|E

Under the new terms, all the land needed could be expropriated including two toises, or , of land on either side for tow paths. The builder could take materials wherever they could be found.|$|E

5|$|From 21 January 1793 to 8 June 1795, <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI's</b> son Louis-Charles was the titular King of France as Louis XVII; in reality, however, he {{was imprisoned}} in the Temple {{throughout}} this duration, and power {{was held by}} {{the leaders of the}} Republic. Upon Louis XVII's death, his uncle (<b>Louis</b> <b>XVI's</b> brother) Louis-Stanislas claimed the throne, as Louis XVIII, but only became de facto King of France in 1814.|$|R
5|$|After {{involving}} {{itself in}} the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War, France found itself financially ruined. Attempts to pass an economic plan to alleviate this in the Estates-General of 1789 led instead to the third estate—the commoners—forking to form the National Assembly. Succeeded in turn by the National Constituent Assembly and the Legislative Assembly, the various legislative bodies succeeded in rendering the monarchy constitutional, limited by democratic institutions. Attempts to remove the monarch entirely, although thwarted on 20 June 1792, led to the effective overthrow of <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI</b> on 10 August. On 21 October, France was formally declared a republic.|$|E
5|$|After the 1793 {{beheading}} of <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI</b> {{sparked a}} war between Britain and France (see the French Revolutionary Wars), Nova Scotia Governor John Wentworth rented Kavanagh's Island to house 600 French prisoners that had been captured on St. Pierre and Miquelon. The commander of the Halifax garrison, Brigadier General James Ogilvie, objected to the plan, and instead housed the prisoners at Cornwallis Barracks in Halifax. Several prisoners were able {{to escape from the}} makeshift prison, and the rest were sent to Guernsey in June 1794.|$|E
5|$|Exportation of merinos without royal {{permission}} {{was also}} a punishable offense, thus ensuring a near-absolute monopoly on the breed until the mid-18th century. After {{the breaking of the}} export ban, fine wool sheep began to be distributed worldwide. The export to Rambouillet by <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI</b> in 1786 formed the basis for the modern Rambouillet (or French Merino) breed. After the Napoleonic Wars and the global distribution of the once-exclusive Spanish stocks of Merinos, sheep raising in Spain reverted to hardy coarse-wooled breeds such as the Churra, and was no longer of international economic significance.|$|E

5|$|In {{recognition}} of the help France gave to the Duke and Duchess in providing them with a home, and in lieu of death duties, the Duchess's collection of <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI</b> style furniture, some porcelain, and paintings were made over to the French state. The British royal family received no major bequests. Most of her estate went to the Pasteur Institute medical research foundation, on the instructions of Suzanne Blum. The decision took the royal family and the Duchess's friends by surprise, as she had shown little interest in charity during her life.|$|E
5|$|Initially part of {{the house}} guard at the royal residences for <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI,</b> Klein left the {{military}} in 1787. During the French Revolution, he enlisted and rose rapidly from a lieutenant to a brigadier general; he participated in the French invasion of southwestern Germany in 1796, and was {{part of the}} Army of the Danube in 1799. His cavalry played critical roles in the battles of Austerlitz and Jena and Auerstadt. Following the Prussian campaign, he retired from active service, entered politics, and performed administrative duties in Paris.|$|E
5|$|<b>Louis</b> <b>XVI</b> and {{the royal}} family were brought to Paris and made prisoners within the Tuileries Palace. In 1793, as the {{revolution}} turned more and more radical, the king, queen, and the mayor were guillotined, along with more than 16,000 others (throughout France), during the Reign of Terror. The property of the aristocracy and the church was nationalised, and the city's churches were closed, sold or demolished. A succession of revolutionary factions ruled Paris until 9 November 1799 (coup d'état du 18 brumaire), when Napoléon Bonaparte seized power as First Consul.|$|E

Later, Saint-Priest accompanied Louis XVIII's exiled court to Blankenburg and Mittau. In 1808, in disagreement with the policies of Louis XVIII, he retired to Switzerland. After vainly seeking permission from Napoleon to return to France, he was expelled from Switzerland, and wandered about Europe until the Bourbon Restoration.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Naundorff did not speak French very well, he managed to {{convince}} various {{former members of the}} <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI's</b> court that he was the Dauphin. He seemed to know everything about the private life of the royal court, gave right answers to most questions and spoke to courtiers as if he had known them as a child. One of them was Agathe de Rambaud, Louis' childhood nurse who accepted him. Others who claimed to have recognized him as the prince include Étienne de Joly, King <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI's</b> Minister of Justice, and Jean Bremond, the king's personal secretary.|$|R
5|$|On 24 January the French {{ambassador}} {{was expelled}} {{in response to}} the execution of <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI</b> in Paris on 21 January and on 1 February the National Convention declared war on Great Britain. The naval campaign in the Atlantic began in earnest in March 1793, when a French battle squadron briefly put to sea before a mutiny forced it to return. The war between Britain and France begun in the Goulet on 2 January 1793 was to last, with a 14-month break in 1802–1803, until 1815.|$|E

5|$|Since early 1792 France {{had been}} at war with four of its {{neighbours}} on two fronts, battling Austria and Prussia in the Austrian Netherlands, and the Austrians and Piedmontese in Italy. On 2 January 1793, almost one year into the French Revolutionary War, republican-held forts at Brest in Brittany fired on the British brig HMS Childers. A few weeks later, following {{the execution of the}} imprisoned King <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI,</b> diplomatic ties between Britain and France were broken. On 1 February France declared war on both Britain and the Dutch Republic.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is a great}} lack of {{scholarship}} {{on the subject of}} <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI's</b> time as a constitutional monarch, though it was a significant length of time. The reason as to why many biographers have not elaborated extensively on this time in the king's life is due to the uncertainty surrounding his actions during this period, as <b>Louis</b> <b>XVI's</b> declaration that was left behind in the Tuileries stated that he regarded his actions during constitutional reign provisional; he reflected that his [...] "palace was a prison". This time period was exemplary in its demonstration of an institution's deliberation while in their last standing moments.|$|R
