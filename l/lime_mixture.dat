5000|$|Horton {{explains}} that the stone town of Shanga was built using primarily two types of coral: Porites solida and coral rag. Porites solida is fairly malleable and can easily be shaped into blocks for wall structures. (26).The practice of shaping coral into blocks occurred approximately between 900 [...] - [...] 1100. Coral rag, a lot more dense is not as easily shaped as Porites solida. Yet despite being a bit more difficult to manage, coral rag was more durable and cheaper to acquire. Coral rag was only used as boundary walls at first, but then eventually became a common building material from 1100 onwards. The coral blocks were set in place with mud or a <b>lime</b> <b>mixture</b> that would serve as mortar. The coral surfaces were often smoothed down with a plaster made from the same limethat was used for mortar.|$|E

The basic principles of this particular application of carbon dating were first suggested in a short paper published in Nature in 1964 by Labeyrie and Delibrias. From an archaelogical point of view, the most interesting aspect of the lime-manufacturing process is that the fixation of radiocarbon within the CaCO 3 structure (i. e. the hardening process of the lime) occurs approximately at the time of construction, which is the information very often sought by archaeologists when buildings are studied. This means that, potentially, radiocarbon dating of mortars can be the most reliable technique for dating old structures...|$|R

50|$|A {{significant}} {{disadvantage of}} acrylic render vs. traditional rendering is that acrylic render lacks the sustainability and environmental compatibility of traditional cement-and-mineral render. All buildings have a finite lifetime, and their materials {{will eventually be}} either recycled or absorbed into the environment. Acrylic being a synthetic polymer material, it does not break down by natural weathering {{the way that a}} cement, sand, and <b>lime</b> <b>mixture</b> will, persisting in the natural environment for centuries as synthetic chemical compounds that have unknown long-term effects on ecosystems. Also, the application and drying process of acrylic resin render involves the atmospheric evaporation of pollutant solvents - necessary for the application of the resin - which are hazardous to the health of humans and of many organisms on which humans depend. Synthetic polymers such as acrylic are manufactured from chemical feedstocks such as acetone, hydrogen cyanide, ethylene, isobutylene, and other petroleum derivatives. The polymer products cannot be fully recycled (using present technology or any that can be confidently expected to be developed), so new raw materials, taken from the finite and diminishing supply of raw natural resources, must always be put into their manufacture, making the process unsustainable. Traditional cement-based render does not have these problems, making it an arguably better choice in many cases, despite its working limitations.|$|E
5000|$|Formerly, tanning was {{considered}} a noxious or [...] "odoriferous trade" [...] and relegated {{to the outskirts of}} town, amongst the poor. Indeed, tanning by ancient methods is so foul smelling, tanneries are still isolated from those towns today where the old methods are used. Skins typically arrived at the tannery dried stiff and dirty with soil and gore. First, the ancient tanners would soak the skins in water to clean and soften them. Then they would pound and scour the skin to remove any remaining flesh and fat. Next, the tanner needed to remove the hair from the skin. This was done by either soaking the skin in urine, painting it with an alkaline <b>lime</b> <b>mixture,</b> or simply allowing the skin to putrefy for several months then dipping it in a salt solution. After the hairs were loosened, the tanners scraped them off with a knife. Once the hair was removed, the tanners would [...] "bate" [...] (soften) the material by pounding dung into the skin, or soaking the skin in a solution of animal brains. Bating was a fermentative process which relied on enzymes produced by bacteria found in the dung. Among the kinds of dung commonly used were those of dogs or pigeons. Sometimes, the dung was mixed with water in a large vat, and the prepared skins were kneaded in the dung water until they became supple from bacterial enzyme action, but not too soft. The ancient tanner might use his bare feet to knead the skins in the dung water, and the kneading could last two or three hours. This combination of urine, animal feces, and decaying flesh made ancient tanneries malodorous. Children employed as dung gatherers were a common sight in ancient cities. Also common were [...] "piss-pots" [...] located on street corners, where human urine could be collected for use in tanneries or by washerwomen.|$|E
50|$|The {{three types}} of hall house are called after the number of rows of pillars which carry the roof {{construction}}. The oldest form, which would also have the lowest roof, was called a Zweiständerhaus because the whole construction rested on two rows of pillars (front to back) carrying beams across the centre. They were pillars and not posts because they rested on stones and were not set in holes in the ground as their predecessors had been. A typical house might have 14 rows of pillars, with a corresponding 14 beams, each of them being originally a single oak tree. Nothing else is load-bearing, although the half-timbered construction with infill does give some extra stability. The infill these days {{is likely to be}} brickwork, but was originally wattle and daub, covered with a <b>lime</b> <b>mixture.</b> The oldest house in Wendland of this construction is around 1611, but only about 10 are 17th century in origin, most of the others being 18th century. They are comparatively rare, as less than 80 remain in Wendland.The more recent form which became common throughout the 19th century is called in German Vierständerhaus which means that the roof construction is carried by four rows of pillars carrying beams. This means that the central barn area is narrower than for Zweiständerhäuser but the two single storey sides are larger. The overall building will also be larger, and are sometimes three stories high, or have two stories with much larger hay lofts and storage above the barn.There is a third form which is called a Dreiständerhaus, with three rows of pillars. This looks like a two pillar-row house on one side, with lower eaves, and a four pillar-row house with higher eaves on the other. It also looks lopsided because the barn door is no longer central under the roof apex. This hybrid form can be found across all the eras but was commoner during the 18th century. It is commoner in Wendland than almost anywhere else across Northern Germany (although even here there are only 40 surviving examples), and there are two Wendland villages, Prießeck and Püggen, where it is the commonest form. It {{does not appear to be}} a transition between the two and the four pillar-row models but a genuine attempt to get the best of two different models, an experiment which ultimately did not make it through to the very end of the 19th century when almost the last hall houses were being built.|$|E

In this context, the current trend is to use materials that do not {{have a negative impact on}} the environment and provide a long term solution. Such local materials for the construction of transportation infrastructure are the active clays. This paper presents the physicochemical and mineralogical structure of clays and their behavior regarding the interaction with water. A negative effect of this interaction is the swelling, the contraction and, respectively, the swell pressure. These produce effects (fissures, cracks) in the structure of roads, highways and, respectively, airport runways.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the presented master's thesis is the preparation of grout mixtures {{on the basis of}} dolomite filling with different mineral binders for the grouting of cultural and historic heritage buildings. Grout mixtures, which are compatible with the ingredients of existing stone walls of heritage objects were prepared and tested. The master's thesis serves experimental purposes and is fully based on different investigations of fresh and hardened injection mixtures on cylindrical test objects and standard prisms. The prepared grout mixtures were based on hydrated lime, lime with added tuff as well as lime and cement. Dolomite flour was used as filling material. The adequacy of the fresh injection mixture was tested according to flow properties and water release. It has been proven that only the <b>lime</b> and cement <b>mixture</b> conforms both criteria, whereas other mixtures showed excessive water release. Hardened injection mixtures were tested on cylindrical test objects and standard prisms in different time frames (35, 70 and 105 days). The prisms were exposed to different ageing conditions on air, at elevated temperature in the NaOH solution and in closed plastic containers. According to the results of compressive and tensile strength testing, it can be assumed that alkali-carbonate reaction developed between the dolomite filling and the mineral binder on test subjects exposed in the environment of NaOH solution. The highest levels of compressive and tensile strength were achieved using the lime-cement test objects. The phenolphthalein test on cylinders and prisms was used to determine the level of carbonization, which was the most intensive on prisms. Due to the limited air intake during the ageing of test specimens, the process of carbonization in the core of the cylinder is a long-term one. The fact is that when injecting the <b>lime</b> <b>mixtures,</b> their weak point is that the process of solidifying in closed spaces is slow and that their obtained strengths are lower compared to the pure cement mixtures.

40|$|The role of gypsum on the {{strength}} of lime treated soils after a long period of interaction is not well understood yet. The present study is performed to scrutinize the physical and strength behavior of lime treated soil with varying gypsum content. Lime and gypsum contents varying from 0 to 6 % are considered in the present study for curing periods up to 28 days. To understand the long-term effects, the work has been extended up to 365 days, particularly with the use of 6 % lime content and varying gypsum contents. Atterberg's limits turned out to be marginally affected by cation exchange. Unconfined compressive strength behavior of lime treated soil varies considerably with gypsum content and curing period. However, trivial alteration in strength is observed in the soil treated with lower lime content (up to 4 %) and gypsum content up to 6 %. On the contrary, strength of soil- 6 % <b>lime</b> <b>mixture</b> with addition of varying gypsum content shows acceleration in early strength at 14 days curing period.

Lime plasters were widely used by the ancient Maya in public monumental buildings and constitute important elements of ancient Maya material culture. This research analyses archaeological samples of lime plasters from three different lowland Maya sites: Palenque, Calakmul and Lamanai. The thesis examines how these building materials changed through time, and includes samples from ca. 400 BC to the 16 th century AD. In addition {{to the analysis of}} archaeological samples, the research also reviews various sources of information, including ethnographic and ethnohistorical descriptions, for the understanding of ancient Maya lime plaster production. The results demonstrate that plasters from the three sites have different characteristics that are due to different access to raw materials and different building traditions at each of the sites. Some of the changes seem to be related to changing economic and political conditions, which is very clear in the use of clays instead of lime for the manufacture of architectural plasters during the Terminal Classic periods at Calakmul and Palenque. Other observations include the use of local meteoritic deposits in the <b>lime</b> <b>mixtures</b> of Palenque, the use of non-local volcanic materials in the late plasters from Lamanai, and the likely use of volcanic ash at Calakmul for the production of hydraulic plasters.

Despite the fact that this method is very simple in principle, several studies have highlighted various practical challenges and factors that must be considered.

However, recently studies have shown that accurate sample processing allow a significant reduction of these error sources and moreover adoption of a special sampling procedure based on the careful selection of lumps of incompletely mixed lime, provides an interesting alternative that avoids problems associated with contamination. The founding principle underlying this technique is the use of the pure lime lumps. These are thought to originate from imperfect mixing and are most prevalent in mortars, renders and plasters predating mechanical mixing. Previous sampling methods for radiocarbon dating did not discriminate between pure and contaminated lime lumps.

The research was carried out on mortars made with ordinary Portland cement (OPC), mineralized white Portland cement, hydraulic <b>lime</b> and a <b>mixture</b> of <b>lime</b> and pozzolana. Mortars underwent sulfation by exposing the samples to 300 ppm SO 2 at 25 °C and 95...|$|R
40|$|Proper {{estimation}} of contaminant transport rate through compacted fine-grained soils assumes great {{importance in the}} context of remediation of contaminated sites. Integrated use of equilibrium and mass transfer rate tests in conjunction with appropriate mass transfer models provide a useful framework for evaluating leaching of contaminants such as lead (Pb 2 +) and zinc (Zn 2 +), which have relatively low pH-dependent solubility. In this article, column experiments were set up to study the diffusion coefficients and break through times using method of slices for two semi-arid soils (Al-Ghat and Al-Qatif) for selected heavy metals (Pb 2 + and Zn 2 +). The studies were carried out on soil samples before and after amending with lime. Breakthrough curves were obtained under different hydraulic gradients for the compacted mixtures and the diffusion coefficients for Pb 2 + and Zn 2 + were evaluated using POLLUTEv 7 relying on advection-dispersion equation, for a liner thickness of 1 m. The current study allowed us to observe the movement of contaminants in the clay liners to be predicted in real time. Break through curves showed relatively higher retention levels for the targeted metal ions. The retention strength of these soils was observed to be constant up to five pore volumes, corresponding to the pH of the effluent and pore water of soil slices. Soils amended with lime showed an improvement to the order of 10 times in retention capacity. Under pure diffusion controlled migration both soil <b>lime</b> <b>mixtures</b> performed very well and gave breakthrough times of more than 400 years whereas advective-diffusion gave break through times of 200 years for both metal ions considered in the study...|$|R

25|$|The Greeks used {{volcanic}} tuff {{from the island}} of Thera as their pozzolan and the Romans used crushed volcanic ash (activated aluminium silicates) with <b>lime.</b> This <b>mixture</b> was able to set under water increasing its resistance. The material was called pozzolana {{from the town of}} Pozzuoli, west of Naples where volcanic ash was extracted. In the absence of pozzolanic ash, the Romans used powdered brick or pottery as a substitute and they may have used crushed tiles for this purpose before discovering natural sources near Rome. The huge dome of the Pantheon in Rome and the massive Baths of Caracalla are examples of ancient structures made from these concretes, many of which are still standing. The vast system of Roman aqueducts also made extensive use of hydraulic cement.|$|R
2500|$|Phosphorus is an {{essential}} plant nutrient (often the limiting nutrient), and the bulk of all phosphorus production is in concentrated phosphoric acids for agriculture fertilisers, containing as much as 70% to 75% P2O5. Its annual demand is rising nearly {{twice as fast as}} the growth of the human population. That led to large increase in phosphate (PO43−) production {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. Artificial phosphate fertilisation is necessary because phosphorus is essential to all life organisms, natural phosphorus-bearing compounds are mostly insoluble and inaccessible to plants, and the natural cycle of phosphorus is very slow. [...] Fertiliser is often in the form of superphosphate of <b>lime,</b> a <b>mixture</b> of calcium dihydrogen phosphate (Ca(H2PO4)2), and calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4·2H2O) produced reacting sulfuric acid and water with calcium phosphate.|$|R
