5000|$|Not to be {{confused}} with [...] "Lean Design &reg;" [...] (copyrighted and patented by Munro & Associates, of Michigan), design for lean manufacturing builds on the set of principles that emerged from design for the customer value and design for manufacturability. Since some lean tools are used in the practice of design for lean manufacturing, it borrows the first word in its name from lean manufacturing as exemplified by the Toyota Production System. [...] Design for lean manufacturing was first coined by Womack, Jones, and Roos after studying the differences between conventional development at American automotive companies and lean methods at Japanese automobile producers. While lean manufacturing focuses on optimization of the production stream and removal of wastes (commonly referred to as muda, mura, and muri) once the value stream has been created, <b>Lean</b> <b>Design</b> ® (Munro & Associates)concerns itself with methods and techniques to create a lean solution from the start, resulting in more value and fewer wastes across the value stream. [...] <b>Lean</b> <b>design</b> ® seeks to optimize the development process through rapid learning cycles to build and test multiple concepts early. [...] Managing the knowledge value stream, systematic problem solving with analysis of the trade-offs between various design options, and solutions generated from ideas filtered by systematic innovation methods are viewed as methods within the <b>lean</b> <b>design</b> process.|$|E

Today, {{many companies are}} familiar with the concepts of lean enterprise management and have applied the lean philosophy to their product design process. To study the impact of such practices, measurements need to be developed to evaluate the leanness of a company's product design.

5000|$|Design for lean {{manufacturing}} {{is based on}} the premise that product and process design is an ongoing activity and not a one-time activity; therefore design for {{lean manufacturing}} should be viewed as a long term strategy for an organization. [...] Design for lean manufacturing must be sustainable and holistic unlike other lean manufacturing or Six Sigma approaches that either tackle only a part of the problem or tackle the problem for a short period of time. Design for lean manufacturing also relates to system thinking as it considers all aspects (or the full circle) and takes the system conditions into consideration when designing products and services, delivering them according to customer needs. ® (Munro & Associates) drives prevention of waste by adopting a systematic process to improve the design phase during development. An organizational focus is required for the implementation of <b>Lean</b> <b>Design</b> ® principles, which includes efficient and sustainable design team. Initial studies of the Japanese approach to design for lean manufacturing noted four principles; leadership of projects by a shusa (or project boss), tightly knit teams, communication on all of the difficult design trade-offs, and simultaneous development between engineering and manufacturing. Further study showed additional depth to the principles, citing 13 principles specific to the Toyota design for lean manufacturing methods in product and process development in the areas of process, skilled people, and tools and technology. As the practice of design for lean manufacturing has expanded in its depth and breadth of application, additional principles have been integrated into the method.|$|E

40|$|Substantial {{benefits}} can {{be achieved}} through the adoption of lean type thinking earlier {{at the design stage}} to create more viable products. A complex design cannot be easily leaned out in production; therefore, the production of affordable and sustainable products requires effective <b>lean</b> <b>design</b> considerations at the conceptual level. The research presented in this thesis investigates and demonstrates the application of <b>lean</b> <b>design</b> for product enhancement. The aim of the research was to develop a novel <b>lean</b> <b>design</b> framework that would support the generation of product design with attributes such as maximise value, manufacturable, and operable with minimum waste and resources ensuring avoidable harm is eliminated. The framework consists of a systemised process which is organised in to phases and activities that provides a unique practical manner to lean out a design. The construction of the framework initiated with an extensive literature review and proceeded with an industrial field study which consisted of 34 interviews with 11 manufacturing companies in Europe. The findings were amalgamated to generate a <b>lean</b> <b>design</b> definition and principles which would form the foundations of the framework. A real-life industrial case study of an offshore oil/water separator was used to validate the framework. In conclusion, the <b>lean</b> <b>design</b> framework provides the necessary means by which a <b>lean</b> <b>design</b> {{can be achieved}}. As a result a functionally viable and enhanced design that is cheaper to manufacture through controlling waste and eliminating avoidable harm occurrence can be realised with minimal effort. The research makes the following contributions: (1) identification of essential elements in <b>lean</b> <b>design,</b> (2) generation of a <b>lean</b> <b>design</b> definition and principles, (3) <b>Lean</b> <b>Design</b> Framework development and (4) illustrative guidelines based on the framework to be used by designers in realising a lean product design...|$|E

In particular, the aspects of between-laboratory variability and predictive capacity are formally separated. Here, the main advantage of the approach is to offer the opportunity for reduced labour, and thus to allow study designs to be more time efficient and cost effective. The impact of this separation was analysed by taking the ECVAM validation study on in vitro methods for skin corrosivity {{as an example of}} a successful validation study — two of its methods triggered new OECD test guidelines. <b>Lean</b> study <b>designs,</b> which reduced the number of tests required by up to 60 %, were simulated with the original validation data for the EPISKIN™ model. By using resampling techniques, we were able to demonstrate the effects of the <b>lean</b> <b>designs</b> on three between-laboratory variability measures and on the predictive capacity in terms of sensitivity and specificity, in comparison with the original study. Overall, the study results, especially the levels of confidence, were only slightly affected by the <b>lean</b> <b>designs</b> that were modelled.

The purpose of the report is to describe the procedure of constructing a calculation template in Excel for the designing of a retaining wall, based {{on the principles of}} <b>Lean</b> <b>design.</b> The intention of making processes more efficient in order to save time and improve quality exists within most businesses. In management literature, one reappearing tool for making processes more efficient in the construction consulting industry is called <b>Lean</b> <b>design.</b> <b>Lean</b> <b>design</b> can be applied to all design and calculation processes for different types of bridges and structures. This report describes the background to <b>Lean</b> <b>design</b> and {{the process of trying to}} implement its principles in the making of a calculation template for the designing of a retaining wall. The purpose is to enable a more efficient designing process, where calculations are standardized, and the results of the process are comprehensibly presented to other actors within the consulting business, such as reviewers and CAD designers. The template is to be used for designing retaining walls in different situations depending on, for instance, construction and soil material, geometry and loads. Consequently, a major part of this report has been devoted to standardizing calculations for load effects and bearing capacity in the construction, depending on different possible settings. Designing is regulated by Eurocodes and national annexes, why it is important to refer to relevant chapters in the regulations. The regulations depend on settings and the field of application for the construction. Therefore, some generalizations of the design process have been made. However, during the process it has been clear that implementation of <b>Lean</b> <b>design</b> is one possible way of making construction design more efficient when it comes to time and quality...|$|E

Since lean concepts focus on low risk, short-term gradual improvement of existing processes and products {{with an emphasis on}} eliminating any and all wastes in the system, applying lean to an organization often implies difficulties in promoting innovations that involve high risks and dramatic changes. Little is known about how <b>lean</b> <b>design</b> and lean supply chain management concepts might affect an organization’s innovation capability and its responsiveness to react quickly to changes brought by radical innovations. These relationships were investigated and analyzed based on findings from two online surveys. Seventy-six and seventy-seven respondents were acquired from the two surveys, respectively. Results suggest that the stressed importance of standardization in <b>lean</b> <b>design</b> has a negative effect on an organization’s radical and architectural innovation capability. It is also shown that disruptive innovation capability will be negatively influenced by value analysis in <b>lean</b> <b>design,</b> especially in terms of how an organization ranks product attributes and allocates resources based on customer requirements. For the impact on an organization’s responsiveness to radical innovations, the findings suggest no impact from minimizing buffers in a lean supply chain but a positive impact from increasing supplier commitment and involvement levels...|$|E
