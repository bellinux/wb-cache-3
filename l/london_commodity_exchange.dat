50|$|In 1986 Anderson was {{appointed}} {{a director of}} the Securities and Investments Board and oversaw the implementation of the Financial Services Act 1986. The aim of the Act was to regulate the financial services industry using a mixture of government regulation and self-regulation. The Act created the Securities and Investments Board which presided over various self-regulation organisations (SRO's). The Act forced all the Baltic futures markets to unite under the banner of the Baltic Futures Association and trading was re-located to the <b>London</b> <b>Commodity</b> <b>Exchange.</b> Anderson was also vice-chairman of the <b>London</b> <b>Commodity</b> <b>Exchange.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} commodity for Oaxaca was cochineal red dye. Cochineal's commodity chain {{is an interesting}} one, with indigenous peasants in the remote areas of Oaxaca ultimately linked to Amsterdam and <b>London</b> <b>commodity</b> <b>exchanges</b> and the European production of luxury cloth. The most extensive scholarly work on Oaxaca's eighteenth-century economy deals with the nexus between the local crown officials (alcaldes mayores), merchant investors (aviadores), the repartimiento (forced labor), and indigenous products, particularly cochineal. The rich, color-fast red dye produced from insects, was harvested from nopal cacti. Cochineal was a high value, low volume product that became the second most valuable Mexican export after silver. Although it could be produced elsewhere in central and southern Mexico, its main region of production was Oaxaca. For the indigenous in Oaxaca, cochineal {{was the only one}} [...] "with which the [...] maintain themselves and pay their debts" [...] but it also had other advantages for them. Producing cochineal was time-consuming labor, but it was not particularly difficult and could be done by the elderly, women, and children. It was also important to households and communities because it initially did not require the indigenous to displace their existing crops or migrate elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|Cochineal is used {{primarily}} as a red food colouring and for cosmetics. The cochineal dye {{was used by the}} Aztec and Maya peoples of Central and North America. Produced almost exclusively in Oaxaca, Mexico, by indigenous producers, cochineal became Mexico's second-most valued export after silver. The dyestuff was consumed throughout Europe, and was so highly valued, its price was regularly quoted on the <b>London</b> and Amsterdam <b>Commodity</b> <b>Exchanges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tate {{served for}} three years as chief {{executive}} of the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland, successor to the Northern Ireland Development Agency. He then chaired the <b>London</b> <b>Commodity</b> <b>Exchange.</b> This had traditionally traded in sugar, coffee and cocoa but, at Tate's instigation, expanded and rebranded to become the London Futures and Options Exchange. In the 1991 New Year Honours, Tate was awarded a CBE. However, the introduction of real-estate futures contracts in 1991 led to a scandal when it was discovered that trading volumes had been artificially boosted, and in October Tate resigned alongside the executive responsible, Mark Blundell. Today, the Exchange is known as the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange.|$|E
50|$|The London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE), {{established}} by Sir Brian Williamson started life on 30 September 1982, {{to take advantage}} of the removal of currency controls in the UK in 1979. The exchange modelled itself after the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It initially offered futures contracts and options linked to short-term interest rates. In 1993 LIFFE merged with the London Traded Options Market (LTOM), adding equity options to its product range. This is when it changed its name to the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange. In 1996 it merged with the <b>London</b> <b>Commodity</b> <b>Exchange</b> (LCE), and, as a result, a range of soft and agricultural commodity contracts was added to its products offering. Trading was conducted by open outcry, where traders meet on the trading floor (in what is called the pit) to conduct trades. The Exchange was originally housed in the historic Royal Exchange building near Bank but then moved to Cannon Bridge in 1991.|$|E

25|$|Cochineal dye {{was used}} by the Aztec and Maya peoples of Central and North America. Eleven cities conquered by Montezuma in the 15th century paid a yearly tribute of 2000 {{decorated}} cotton blankets and 40 bags of cochineal dye each. Production of cochineal is depicted in Codex Osuna. During the colonial period, the production of cochineal (grana fina) grew rapidly. Produced almost exclusively in Oaxaca by indigenous producers, cochineal became Mexico's second-most valued export after silver. Soon after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, it began to be exported to Spain, and by the 17th century was a commodity traded as far away as India. The dyestuff was consumed throughout Europe and was so highly prized, its price was regularly quoted on the <b>London</b> and Amsterdam <b>Commodity</b> <b>Exchanges.</b> In 1777, French botanist Nicolas-Joseph Thiéry de Menonville, presenting himself as a botanizing physician, smuggled the insects and pads of the Opuntia cactus to Saint Domingue. This particular collection failed to thrive and ultimately died out, leaving the Mexican monopoly intact. After the Mexican War of Independence in 1810–1821, the Mexican monopoly on cochineal came to an end. Large-scale production of cochineal emerged, especially in Guatemala and the Canary Islands; it was also cultivated in Spain and North Africa.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the first}} legal {{arrangements}} in the Ottoman Empire {{were carried out}} in 1886, {{it is known that}} some attempts were made before this date to establish a <b>commodity</b> <b>exchange</b> in İzmir. It is also known that the building belonging to a tradesman called Nişli Hacı Ali Efendi was used as “the grain exchange” just before the 1890s. The arguments to establish a modern <b>commodity</b> <b>exchange</b> based on a legal status and conforming to certain rules were brought forward in the early 1890s. In 1891, two different <b>commodity</b> <b>exchanges</b> were attempted to be established by two different tradesmen, however, the General <b>Commodity</b> <b>Exchange</b> regulations specified only one <b>commodity</b> <b>exchange</b> in each city. Therefore, upon the inspections by the Ministry of Public Works, Nişli Hacı Ali Efendi’s <b>Commodity</b> <b>Exchange</b> was declared as the sole legal exchange in the city and it was inaugurated with a ceremony on Monday, 13 June 1892.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of agricultural <b>commodity</b> <b>exchanges</b> in Africa {{has become an}} increasingly popular strategy for addressing some of the ills plaguing African food markets, including poorly developed risk management systems, high transaction costs, and limited price discovery. However, despite substantial support from donors and, in some cases, national governments, <b>commodity</b> <b>exchanges</b> in most African countries are having difficulties getting off the ground. While previous studies (Rashid, Winter-Nelson, and Garcia 2010) highlight the fact that low trade volumes passing through African <b>commodity</b> <b>exchanges</b> limit their development, {{the question of why}} exchanges are thinly traded remains poorly understood. Using the Zambian Agricultural <b>Commodity</b> <b>Exchange</b> (ZAMACE) as a case study, this report identifies and explores six mutually reinforcing factors contributing to low trade volumes passing through ZAMACE. By analyzing why trade volumes and participation on ZAMACE have remained both low and erratic, this report seeks to provide policy makers and donors with greater clarity about the specific impediments to be overcome in developing <b>commodity</b> <b>exchanges</b> in the region.

40|$|The <b>commodity</b> <b>exchange</b> is {{regarded}} as one of the key institutions of market economy. Stockbrokers were a truly essential group of workers of the <b>commodity</b> <b>exchanges.</b> It was on the level of their organization and professional ethics that depended the level of efficient functioning of this institution. The basic law regulations, orders and stock charters were traced in this paper, which marked principles of stockbrokers’ activity. These principles were considered from the point of view of the ethical norms establishing the contemporary ethics of economic life. My special attention was concentrated on these principles of stockbrokers’ activities which concern the way of their appointing, rights as well as duties. „Ethical aspects” of stockbrokers’ activity on the Polish <b>commodity</b> <b>exchanges</b> were traced for the period from 1921 to the 1950.
