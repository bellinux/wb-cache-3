25|$|The {{community}} language learning (CLL) {{is a method}} proposed by Charles A. Curran during the 1970s. It {{is based on the}} counseling approach in which the teacher is seen as a counselor. It emphasizes the sense of community in the <b>learning</b> <b>group,</b> encourages interaction as a vital aspect of learning, and it considers as a priority the students' feelings and the recognition of struggles in language acquisition. There is no syllabus or textbook to follow and it is the students themselves who determine the content of the lesson. Notably, it incorporates translation and recording techniques.|$|E

The community, managed chiefly by Bruckman, developed a significant following for its time, eventually closing down seven years later. During this time, Bruckman also worked as a research assistant for Sherry Turkle on Turkle's influential book, Life on the Screen (1997). For her dissertation work, Bruckman developed MOOSE Crossing, a MOO-based constructionist learning environment in which young children could learn computer programming skills while building virtual objects.|$|E
25|$|An {{observation}} of the Datta study is that the <b>learning</b> <b>group</b> spent 180% more time in SWS than did the control group during the post-trial sleep-recording session. This study shows that after spatial exploration activity, patterns of hippocampal place cells are reactivated during SWS following the experiment. Rats were run through a linear track using rewards on either end. The rats would then {{be placed in the}} track for 30 minutes to allow them to adjust (PRE), then they ran the track with reward-based training for 30 minutes (RUN), and then they were allowed to rest for 30 minutes.|$|E
30|$|One of the {{rationales}} for tracking in Germany is that school lessons {{can be better}} optimized according to student requirements if students are in homogeneous <b>learning</b> <b>groups.</b> For instance, because students in homogenous <b>learning</b> <b>groups</b> assumedly require similar <b>learning</b> time, <b>groups</b> with high achievers can cover more learning topics as well as topics with higher cognitive demands (KÃ¶ller and Baumert [2001], [2012]). In short, the supposition is that students attain higher learning outcomes in homogeneous <b>learning</b> <b>groups</b> than in heterogeneous ones.|$|R
40|$|In {{a sample}} of 459 {{students}} organized in 84 groups this study tests the impact of group role balance on teamwork quality and three performance indicators in collaborative <b>learning</b> <b>groups</b> (group cognitive complexity, perceived performance and objective performance). The results show that group role balance positively predicts group performance in preliminary phases of the group project but not in later phases. Moreover, group role balance positively predicts group cognitive complexity and is negatively related to teamwork quality. The results hold only when role balance is conceptualized as a configural property of groups instead of a sum of individual roles.

25|$|Bowling has {{experienced}} another decline {{since the late}} 1990s and into the 2000s, especially in the United States. From 1998 to 2013, the number of bowling alleys in the U.S. fell from about 5,400 to 3,976, a 26% drop. This is partly attributed to the decline of league bowling participation, which used to account for most of a bowling center's revenue, {{as well as the}} decline in social activity overall (see Bowling Alone), according to Robert Putnam, public policy professor at Harvard University. For example, the Metro Detroit USBC Chapter, which has long had the most certified league members of any chapter in the entire USBC organization, now numbers about 45,000, down from about 300,000 in the late 1970s. Bowling centers once counted on league bowling for about 70% of their revenues, but studies by White Hutchinson Leisure & <b>Learning</b> <b>Group</b> and others suggest that figure is now only about 40%.|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the organization of}} social <b>learning</b> by <b>groups</b> in practice, this chapter elaborates {{on the use of}} a framework of dimensions and indicators to explore social learning within (prospective) teacher groups. The applied framework that we call the âDimensions of Social Learning (DSL) Frameworkâ is built upon four dimensions including 11 indicators corresponding to these dimensions. The DSL Framework was induced by a literature review that applied notions of social networks, communities of practice and learning teams as the main underlying perspectives and has been tested empirically in higher education. In this chapter, to validate the framework, we present the findings of a case study that applied the DSL Framework to explore the social dimensions of particular teacher <b>learning</b> <b>groups</b> and to reflect on the usefulness of the indicators in terms of compiling an image of the <b>learning</b> <b>groupâs</b> social configuration. The case study suggests that the framework appears fruitful for assessing the social configuration of teacher <b>learning</b> <b>groups.</b> Moreover, the resulting image allows teachers to analyse whether their groupâs configuration fits its learning goals, or whether adjustments are required. It is therefore possible to improve learning processes within teacher <b>learning</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

40|$|The first {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine if minimal training on the concepts and effects of relational, task, and process conflict would have an effect on proportional process conflict (Jehn, 2000) in undergraduate cooperative <b>learning</b> <b>groups.</b> Proportional process conflict is explained as the amount of process conflict in proportion to relational and task conflict and to the overall amount of conflict within the group. The second purpose was to increase knowledge about the cultural patterns and perspectives of undergraduate cooperative <b>learning</b> <b>groups.</b> The sample consisted of 68 undergraduate students from four classes of the same course at a Christian university. Two classes were given conflict training and two classes were not given the training. In order to obtain quantitative data, the Conflict Survey, with a Likert-type scale, was formed by combining questions from the refined Intragroup Conflict Scale (Pearson, Ensley 2 Ì 6 Amason, 2002) with questions from Shah and Jehnâs survey (1993). The Conflict Survey was administered at the beginning, middle and end of the semesters. The Bales Interaction Process Analysis (Forsyth, 1983), informal interviews, and conversations were used to gather qualitative information. Results of the one-tailed t-tests showed no significant differences in the proportional process conflict between the undergraduate cooperative <b>learning</b> <b>groups.</b> The analyses of the Conflict Survey and the Bales Interaction Process Analysis indicated low amounts of relational, task, and process conflict in all of the cooperative <b>learning</b> <b>groups.</b> This indicates low levels of proportional process conflict in the cooperative <b>learning</b> <b>groups.</b> In contrast, informal conversations and observations revealed considerable relational and process conflict in some groups...|$|R

40|$|<b>Learning</b> networks, <b>groups</b> or {{communities}} {{are seen as}} having the potential to provide supportive, integrative and deep learning processes which can enhance student performance and support transition to university (Peat, Dalziel and Grant 2001; Zhao and Kuh 2004). The provision of a learning environment with opportunities for meaningful academic and social interactions is characteristic of higher education and collaborative learning strategies are frequently used to encourage student selfmanagement, independence and the general development of group skills. Whilst the value-added potential of <b>learning</b> <b>groups</b> is well documented (Peat et al. 2001; Zhao and Kuh 2004; Lizzio and Wilson, 2006), {{the nature of the}} course subject is rarely considered as potentially significant to the effectiveness of the group process; the emphasis in research studies being more frequently concerned with generic academic or pastoral functions. The Early Childhood degree at the University of Worcester established <b>learning</b> <b>groups</b> in 2002 as a specific learning and teaching strategy aligning the pedagogic and andragogic philosophy of the subject to promote academic and professional characteristics required as transferable skills for work in the sector. The social constructivist philosophy underpinning the subject and practice of early childhood provided the common, connecting thread for <b>learning</b> <b>groups</b> to have relevance and meaning for personal, academic and professional development. This study investigated the experience and perceived value of <b>learning</b> <b>groups</b> for the first cohort in 2002 / 3 through a questionnaire, and by interviews focussed more openly on their general first year experience with a sample group of year 1 students in 2008.
