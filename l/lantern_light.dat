25|$|Nearing Peterborough, Beeton and Priestley heard a {{cracking}} {{noise as}} the cart rolled over some stones. Consequently, {{they had the}} van inspected by Gideon Lucas, owner of the King's Head Inn. The perusal, conducted by <b>lantern</b> <b>light</b> because they had departed Market Deeping at nine thirty at night, revealed nothing amiss with the cart. Nevertheless, while traversing the mile south from Peterborough towards Norman Cross, the wagon's front axle cracked along {{a third of its}} length and gave way, overturning the vehicle. Beeton was pulled ahead of the van's collapse by the horses, escaping substantial harm. Priestley was less fortunate: some four hundredweight worth of mutton fell on him, resulting in a broken thigh, a dislocated shoulder, and various other injuries.|$|E
500|$|... "Gender Bender" [...] marked Rob Bowman's directorial {{debut on}} the series; {{he became one}} of the series' most {{prolific}} directors, even directing the 1998 film adaptation, [...] Bowman found [...] "Gender Bender" [...] a difficult episode to work on—the script had initially called for <b>lantern</b> <b>light</b> to illuminate several scenes, but this was found to be unworkable. In addition, an interior set constructed to represent the catacombs under the Kindred's barn was so encumbering to film in that a second unit crew were required to reshoot a large degree of camera coverage. This need for extra footage necessitated an additional day of filming for scenes featuring Duchovny.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Marvel Cave started {{offering}} The <b>Lantern</b> <b>Light</b> Tour. In {{this tour}} the electric lights are turned {{off in the}} cave and lanterns are given to {{each member of the}} tour. Unlike the regular tours which are free, this tour costs $12.50, and is limited to 20 people. The tour has been extended into the Mammoth Room, making it the first tour to incorporate this room in more than fifty years. One is also able to see both the summer and fall sections if the Waterfall Room is not flooded. [...] The tour lasts {{about an hour and a}} half. [...] The guide focuses on the history and folklore of the cave and is able to explain more information about the cave due to the small group setting of the tour.|$|E

2500|$|A notable part of {{celebrating the}} holiday is the {{carrying}} of brightly lit <b>lanterns,</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>lanterns</b> on towers, or floating sky lanterns.

50|$|Chinese monks used {{lanterns}} on {{the twelfth}} {{day of the}} first lunar moon to worship Buddha. During the Eastern Han Dynasty, the Emperor, Liu Zhuang, was a Buddhist and ordered his citizenry to <b>light</b> <b>lanterns</b> to worship Buddha as the monks did. Eventually, this <b>lantern</b> <b>lighting</b> became a grand festival among the common people. During the Tang Dynasty (618 AD - 907 AD), lanterns symbolized and celebrated the prosperity, strength and power of China. From then on, <b>lighting</b> <b>lanterns</b> became popular throughout the entire country.|$|R

60|$|The steward flung another {{quick glance}} over Michael {{and made up}} his mind. He turned away casually and strolled along the beach out of the circle of <b>lantern</b> <b>light.</b> A hundred yards away {{he sat down in}} the sand and waited.|$|E
60|$|Grant knelt down, and {{his face}} also showed {{colourless}} in the <b>lantern</b> <b>light</b> as, {{with the help of}} another man, he gently moved the rigid form. Then, opening the big fur-coat he laid his hand on a brown smear on the deerskin jacket under it.|$|E
60|$|I {{raised a}} shout, {{and she ran}} down to see. In the yellow <b>lantern</b> <b>light</b> we peered at what we had accomplished. We looked at each other, and our hands felt their way and clasped. The eyes of both of us, I think, were moist with the joy of success.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the largest}} Exhibition {{pavilion}} on the site approximately 58 X 20 metres and 5.5 metres high with twin gabled roofs, each with three hipped roof <b>lantern</b> <b>lights</b> at a length of approx. 5 metres which run along the two ridges. The <b>lantern</b> <b>lights</b> incorporate two fixed windows one at each end and six hopper windows which push out to provide additional ventilation. Timber buttresses provide additional strengthening to the high external walls which are clad in galvanised corrugated iron sheeting painted green. The corrugated iron cladding does not extend the full height of the wall instead infill to the rafters is provided via timber lattice panels which also provide additional ventilation. Horizontal timber slat panels conceal the underfloor area.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lantern</b> <b>lights</b> {{running along}} the ridge line of each gabled roof consist of box-like {{structures}} with curved roofs of corrugated iron. Three reversible casement windows face both north and south on each lantern. Walls {{to the east and}} west are clad in ripple iron. Gutters are quad-profile.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to lanterns, most elevators have a chime to indicate if the elevator {{is going up}} or down either {{before or after the}} doors open, usually in conjunction with the <b>lanterns</b> <b>lighting</b> up. Universally, one chime is for up, two is for down, and none indicates an elevator that is 'free'.|$|R
60|$|A {{man took}} up the hammer, and then waited a moment, looking at those who stood about Larry. He could see the faces {{of one or two}} in the <b>lantern</b> <b>light,</b> and {{recognized}} that he need expect no support from them. The men were resolute Americans, who had no desire for anything approaching anarchy.|$|E
60|$|So Mrs. Cliff and Willy {{lived on}} in peace, comfort, and quiet {{in their old}} home, while on the corner lot there was hammering, and banging, and sawing all day. Mr. Burke would have had this work go on by night, but the {{contractor}} refused. His men would work extra hours in consideration of extra inducements, but good carpenter work, he declared, could not be done by <b>lantern</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
60|$|Dag Daughtry strolled {{along the}} beach, Michael {{at his heels}} or running circles of delight around him at every {{repetition}} of that strange low lip- noise, and paused just outside the circle of <b>lantern</b> <b>light</b> where dusky forms laboured with landing cargo from the whaleboats and where the Commissioner's clerk and the Makambo's super-cargo still wrangled over the bill of lading. When Michael would have gone forward, the man withstrained him with the same inarticulate, almost inaudible kiss.|$|E

50|$|In February, a snow lantern {{festival is}} held in Yonezawa at the Uesugi Shrine. Hundreds of candle-lit <b>lanterns</b> <b>light</b> {{pathways}} dug into the snow around the shrine. Yonezawa is also {{the site of the}} Uesugi Festival (上杉祭り, uesugi matsuri) in mid-spring. The festival's highlight is a re-enactment of the Battle of Kawanakajima {{on the banks of the}} Matsukawa River.|$|R
50|$|In the evening, {{lighting}} {{ceremony is}} held when lay {{people who have}} bought lamps or <b>lanterns</b> <b>light</b> them by placing a candle inside the lantern, at about 7.30 PM. The lighted lamps are a delightful sight to behold, walking around the monastery or viewing {{from the top of}} a nearby hill. The lamps are later dimmed to mark the end of the ceremony.|$|R
6000|$|Leaning forward, {{he touched}} Grant's knee. [...] "Larry, it's bracing. The {{last few months}} were making me a little sick of everything--but this gets hold of one." [...] Grant smiled, but Breckenridge saw how weary his bronzed face showed in the dim <b>lantern</b> <b>light.</b> [...] "There was a time, {{two or three years}} ago, when I might have felt it as you seem to do," [...] he said. [...] "I don't seem to have any feeling but {{tiredness}} left me now." ...|$|E
60|$|The wind {{continued}} to beat about {{the corners of}} the hut, but the flute-playing ceased. A rectangular space of light appeared {{in the side of the}} hut, and in the opening the outline of Farmer Oak's figure. He carried a lantern in his hand, and closing the door behind him, came forward and busied himself about this nook of the field for nearly twenty minutes, the <b>lantern</b> <b>light</b> appearing and disappearing here and there, and brightening him or darkening him as he stood before or behind it.|$|E
60|$|Christian {{pulled on}} his boots, and with heavy breathings, which could be heard to some distance, dragged his limbs together, arose, and tottered away out of sight. Wildeve set about {{shutting}} the lantern {{to return to the}} house, for he deemed it too late to go to Mistover to meet his wife, who was to be driven home in the captain's four-wheel. While he was closing the little horn door a figure rose from behind a neighbouring bush and came forward into the <b>lantern</b> <b>light.</b> It was the reddleman approaching.|$|E

50|$|This {{year the}} Band Wars was in {{association}} with MTVi Xtreme and saw participation of bands across genres, with Ryan Victor Project and Celestial Teapot emerging as the winners. Pronite attracted a huge crowd with popular Bollywood singer Sonu Kakkar and DJ Anshul entertaining a lively audience. The three days of festivity ended on a bright note with flying <b>lanterns</b> <b>lighting</b> up the winter sky.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} for perhaps five minutes, {{and the men}} watched each other, one white {{in the face and}} quivering a little, his adversary impassive as a statue, but quietly observant. Then there was a patter of hasty footsteps, and the fräulein stood in the <b>lantern</b> <b>light</b> with a flushed, plump face and {{somewhat}} scanty dress. She apparently recognized the man, and her colour deepened, but that was the only sign of confusion she showed; and it was evident that the discipline of the fatherland had not been neglected in Muller's household.|$|E
6000|$|In {{descending}} {{the column}} her eye fell upon the superscription {{of one of}} the letters, and she opened and glanced over it by the <b>lantern</b> <b>light.</b> She seemed startled, and, musing, said, 'The postponement of our--intention must be, I fear, for a long time. I find that after {{the end of this month}} I cannot leave home safely, even for a day.' Perceiving that he was about to ask why, she added, 'I will not trouble you with the reason now; it would only harass you. It is only a family business, and cannot be helped.' ...|$|E
60|$|He swung {{himself to}} the saddle, swept off his hat to the girl, who stood with the <b>lantern</b> <b>light</b> upon her in the doorway, smiling but flushed, and shook his bridle. Then there was a jingle that {{was lost in the}} thud of hoofs, and the men {{vanished}} into the shadowy prairie. Half an hour later the homestead was once more dark and silent; but three men sent out by Grant were riding at a reckless gallop across the great dusky levels, and breakfast was not finished when those whom they had summoned reached Fremont ranch.|$|E
25|$|During this festival, much of {{the city}} is {{decorated}} with <b>lanterns,</b> <b>lights</b> and special displays of light (known as thoran). The festival falls in mid May and lasts a week. Many Sri Lankans visit the city to see the lantern competitions and decorations. During this week people distribute, rice, drinks and other food items for free in dunsal which means charity place. These dunsal are popular amongst visitors from the suburbs.|$|R
50|$|The City of Prairie City, {{assuming}} {{management of}} the building in 1984, used it to house the DeWitt Museum.

Other parts of the museum house a collection of rocks and minerals, family photo albums, and mining artifacts from Grant County {{at the turn of}} the 20th century.|$|R
6000|$|All day {{the work}} went on. Night descended, {{but still the}} cable was coming in slowly, unwillingly,--now jerkily, as if half {{inclined}} to yield, anon painfully, as if changing its mind, until the strain was equal to {{two and a half}} tons. A row of <b>lanterns</b> <b>lighted</b> it, and the men employed watched and handled it carefully to detect the [...] "fault," [...] while the clattering wheels played harsh music.|$|R
