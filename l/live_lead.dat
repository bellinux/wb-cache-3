500|$|Before {{entering}} the studio, Metallica collected ideas on [...] "riff tape" [...] recordings of various jam sessions. Hetfield and Ulrich {{went through the}} tapes and selected the strongest riffs to assemble into songs. Instruments were recorded separately, with Hetfield playing only rhythm guitar. Rasmussen, {{with the help of}} drum roadie Flemming Larsen, taught the basics of timing and beat duration to Ulrich, who had a tendency to increase speed and had little knowledge of rhythm theory. Drums were recorded in an empty warehouse {{at the back of the}} studio, which was not soundproof and caused reverberation. Although four tracks were already arranged, the band members were not used to creating songs in the studio, as they had not done so for Kill 'Em All. [...] "For Whom the Bell Tolls", [...] "Trapped Under Ice" [...] and [...] "Escape" [...] were written from scratch in Copenhagen, and the band put finishing touches on [...] "Fight Fire with Fire", [...] "Ride the Lightning", [...] "Creeping Death", and [...] "The Call of Ktulu", which were already performed <b>live.</b> <b>Lead</b> guitarist Kirk Hammett took the album's name from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. The cover art, displaying an electric chair in the midst of lightning bolts, was conceived before recording began. Metallica initially had sound problems because its gear was stolen three weeks before the band arrived in Copenhagen. Band members slept in the studio by day as they could not afford a hotel and recorded by night because the studio was booked by other artists during daytime. Because the group was looking for a major label deal, several A representatives from different labels visited the studio. At first it seemed Metallica was going to sign with Bronze Records, but the deal fell through because Bronze executive Gerry Bron did not appreciate the work done at Sweet Silence and wanted the US edition to be remixed by engineer Eddie Kramer, and even considered re-recording the album in another studio. Metallica was put off by Bron's failure to share the band's artistic vision and decided to look for another label for the US release, in spite of the fact that Bronze had already advertised Metallica as one of their bands.|$|E
