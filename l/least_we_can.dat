5|$|The band {{formed at}} Manchester University, but settled in London where they signed with Charisma. They {{went through a}} number of incarnations in their early years, {{including}} a brief split in 1969. When they reformed, they found minor commercial success with The <b>Least</b> <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> Do Is Wave to Each Other (February 1970), and after the follow-up album, H to He, Who Am the Only One (December 1970), stabilised around a line-up of Hammill, organist Hugh Banton, saxophonist David Jackson, and drummer Guy Evans. The quartet subsequently achieved significant success in Italy with the release of Pawn Hearts in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The group's {{previous}} album, The <b>Least</b> <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> Do Is Wave to Each Other (February 1970) {{had achieved}} {{a small amount}} of commercial success and critical acclaim in the UK and Europe. The next project the group attempted was recording the soundtrack to the 1970 film Eyewitness, but it was rejected, largely for being too sinister. They started to develop a live following during 1970, counting film director Anthony Minghella as one of their fans, but things backfired after a show at the Royal Festival Hall in June that drew negative reviews from Melody Makers Chris Welch. Around this time, the band decided to write some new material for a follow-up album.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in December 1970, but did not sell as much as The <b>Least</b> <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> Do, and did not reach the album charts in the UK. Charisma hoped the group could produce another single like [...] "Refugees", released earlier in the year. There was some interest in releasing [...] "Killer" [...] as a single, but the band rejected this as {{they might have been}} pigeonholed as a hard rock band. The group felt there was some conflict of interest by having Tony Stratton-Smith both as manager and record company owner.|$|E
500|$|Tony Stratton-Smith formed Charisma Records {{and signed}} the band {{as his first}} act, who {{recorded}} their second album, The <b>Least</b> <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> Do Is Wave to Each Other from 11–14 December 1969 with producer John Anthony in Trident Studios. Hammill's voice was electronically treated on [...] "After the Flood", while [...] "Refugees" [...] and [...] "White Hammer" [...] featured cello and cornet respectively. Because the band finished ahead of their rehearsal schedule, Potter decided to overdub some electric guitar – an instrument he had never played before. The album was released in February 1970 and made the top 50 in the U.K, Melody Maker said [...] "If all our groups were as together as this, the British music scene would improve ten-fold." ...|$|E
500|$|Hammill wanted King Crimson's guitarist and bandleader Robert Fripp {{to play on}} [...] "The Emperor In His War Room". Fripp {{had never}} played as a session {{musician}} at that point, but had enjoyed listening to The <b>Least</b> <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> Do... and was persuaded to take part by Anthony. Jackson recalled that Fripp [...] "set up all of his stuff, put his headphones on, and started searing away." [...] Fripp played the guitar part twice, having never heard the track before, and a composite of both takes appears on the final recording. Fripp has subsequently introduced Anthony as [...] "the guy who gave me my first session" [...] at events. Fripp would collaborate again with Van der Graaf Generator on their next album, Pawn Hearts, released the following year.|$|E

Jozen Cummings of The Wall Street Journal described {{the show as}} Beyoncé's [...] "most intimate work to date", adding {{that it was an}} intimate night between [...] "Beyoncé and her fans, one in which there need not be a specific stand-out moment". Gavin DeGraw of VH1 noted that [...] "there's no doubting Beyoncé's talent as a performer; her undeniable vocal ability, show(wo)manship, and charm" [...] which infused the room the entire evening." [...] By contrast, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone gave the show a mixed review, writing [...] "a Beyoncé concert is a big, blowsy affair, a bit like a Las Vegas floor show crossed with a typhoon. 'Intimate' is not the adjective that leaps to mind". However, he described Beyoncé as [...] "a woman who can make a club feel like a coliseum". Rosen coined the live performance of [...] "I Was Here" [...] as [...] "a hollow exercise in self-mythologizing". Maura Johnston of The Village Voice placed 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé on her list of The 10 Best Live Shows of 2011. In a review of the show, she commented [...] "The serenity at her core is borne from a supreme amount of confidence; that it comes off as something generously given is a testament to her prodigious talents as a performer on every level. Plus, I mean, have you heard her sing? Nobody has pipes like her right now. Not a single person out there. At the very <b>least,</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all learn breath control from her." ...|$|E

On his return he managed the Derrick Robins XI tour of South Africa, a multiracial cricket team led by Brian Close and including Younis Ahmed, John Shepherd and Gordon Greenidge in an attempt to restore cricket links with South Africa. When they arrived in Cape Town he found that [...] "all the lads I coached twenty years ago are now big businessmen" [...] and he received a warm welcome. He managed another Derek Robins XI under David Lloyd the next year and although the cricket was a success they failed to re-establish international cricket in South Africa and an attempt to integrate cricket in South Africa failed.|$|E
