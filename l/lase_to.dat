Broadband absorption results in dissociation with {{the formation of}} excited metastable Br atoms, some of which then <b>lase</b> <b>to</b> the ground state Br. The ground state is depopulated by three-body recombination and, more importantly, by exchange reactions which more than compensate for the high quenching in heteronuclear halogen systems. Kinetic modeling indicates lasing is possible in the pulsed mode and possibly in the steady state with a cooled gas flow system. Temperature effects are discussed.

40|$|X-ray free-electron laser {{oscillator}} (XFELO) {{is expected to}} be a cutting edge tool for fully coherent X-ray laser generation, and undulator taper technique is well-known for considerably increasing the efficiency of free-electron lasers (FELs). In order to combine the advantages of these two schemes, FEL amplifier seeded by XFELO is proposed by simply using a chirped electron beam. With the right choice of the beam parameters, the bunch tail is within the gain bandwidth of XFELO, and <b>lase</b> <b>to</b> saturation, which will be served as a seeding for further amplification. Meanwhile, the bunch head which is outside the gain bandwidth of XFELO, is preserved and used in the following FEL amplifier. It is found that the natural "double-horn" beam current as well as residual energy chirp from chicane compressor are quite suitable for the new scheme. Inheriting the advantages from XFELO seeding and undulator tapering, it is feasible to generate nearly terawatt level, fully coherent X-ray pulses with unprecedented shot-to-shot stability, which might open up new scientific opportunities in various research fields.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess the {{hypotheses}} that laser irradiation is equally effective for bonding as traditional acid-etch procedures, and that tooth substrate prepared either by Erbium:YAG laser or diamond bur is equally receptive to adhesive procedures. Buccal/oral enamel and mid-coronal dentin were laser-irradiated using an Erbium:YAG laser. A total-etch adhesive (OptiBond FL) applied with and without prior acid-etching and a self-etch adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond) were employed to bond the composite. The micro-tensile bond strength (microTBS) was determined after 24 h of storage in water. Failure patterns were analysed using a stereo-microscope, and samples were processed for Field-emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (Fe-SEM) evaluation. Unbonded, lased enamel and dentin surfaces were evaluated using Fe-SEM as well. The total-etch adhesive bonded significantly less effectively <b>to</b> <b>lased</b> than <b>to</b> bur-cut enamel/dentin. Laser 'conditioning' was clearly less effective than acid-etching. Moreover, acid etching lased enamel and dentin significantly improved the microTBS of OptiBond FL.

40|$|Programmers make {{systematic}} edits—similar, but {{not identical}} changes to multiple places during software development and maintenance. Finding all the correct locations and making correct edits is a tedious and error-prone process. Existing tools for automating systematic edits are limited {{because they do}} not support edit generation, edit location suggestion, or edit application at the same time, except for specialized or trivial edits. However, since many similar changes are needed in locations that contain similar context (the surrounding dependent code and syntactic structures), there is an opportunity to automate the systematic editing process by inferring edit scripts and characterizing their context from code that developers changed already. The challenge is we need to abstract and generalize from example(s) in order to create an edit script that is correct in many different contexts. This thesis seeks to substantially improve the efficiency and correctness of automatic systematic program transformation.

40|$|The TARFOX (Tropospheric Aerosol Radiative Forcing Observational Experiment) {{intensive}} field {{campaign was}} designed to reduce uncertainties in estimates {{of the effects of}} anthropogenic aerosols on climate by measuring direct radiative effects and the optical, physical, and chemical properties of aerosols [1]. TARFOX was conducted off the East Coast of the United States between July 10 - 31, 1996. Ground, aircraft, and satellite-based sensors measured the sensitivity of radiative fields at various atmospheric levels to aerosol optical properties (i. e., optical thickness, phase function, single-scattering albedo) and to the vertical profile of aerosols. The LASE (Lidar Atmospheric Sensing Experiment) instrument, which was flown on the NASA ER- 2 aircraft, measured vertical profiles of total scattering ratio and water vapor during a series of 9 flights. These profiles were used in real-time to help direct the other aircraft to the appropriate altitudes for intensive sampling of aerosol layers. We have subsequently used the LASE aerosol data to derive aerosol backscattering and extinction profiles. Using these aerosol extinction profiles, we derived estimates of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and compared these with measurements of AOT from both ground and airborne sun photometers and derived from the ATSR- 2 (Along Track and Scanning Radiometer 2) sensor on ERS- 2 (European Remote Sensing Satellite- 2).

40|$|Harmonic lasing {{in a free}} {{electron}} laser with a planar undulator (under the condition that the fundamental frequency is suppressed) might be a cheap and efficient way of extension of wavelength ranges of existing and planned X-ray FEL facilities. Contrary to nonlinear harmonic generation, harmonic lasing can provide much more intense, stable, and narrow-band FEL beam which is easier to handle due to the suppressed fundamental frequency. In this paper we perform a parametrization of {{the solution of the}} eigenvalue equation for lasing at odd harmonics, and present an explicit expression for FEL gain length, taking into account all essential effects. We propose and discuss methods for suppression of the fundamental harmonic. We also suggest a combined use of harmonic lasing and lasing at the retuned fundamental wavelength in order to reduce bandwidth and to increase brilliance of X-ray beam at saturation. Considering 3 rd harmonic lasing as a practical example, we {{come to the conclusion that}} it is much more robust than usually thought, and can be widely used in the existing or planned X-ray FEL facilities. In particular, LCLS after a minor modification can <b>lase</b> <b>to</b> saturation at the 3 rd harmonic up to the photon energy of 25 - 30 keV providing multi-gigawatt power level and narrow bandwidth. As for the European XFEL, harmonic lasing would allow to extend operating range (ultimately up to 100 keV), to reduce FEL bandwidth and to increase brilliance, to enable two-color operation for pump-probe experiments, and to provide more flexible operation at different electron energies. Finally, in this paper we discover that in a part of the parameter space, corresponding to the operating range of soft X-ray beamlines of X-ray FEL facilities (like SASE 3 beamline of the European XFEL), harmonics can grow faster than the fundamental wavelength...|$|E

40|$|Recently, the use {{of laser}} {{technology}} {{as an alternative to}} mechanical rotating instruments for cavity preparation has been introduced. Objectives: The hypothesis tested was that laser irradiation is equally effective to pre-treat enamel and dentin as acid-etch procedures. Methods: Buccal/oral enamel and mid-coronal human dentin was laser-irradiated using an Er:YAG laser (λ= 2. 94 µm; Fidelis, Fotona Medical Lasers) set to 10 Hz and 120 mJ for enamel, and 10 Hz and 80 mJ for dentin (settings for enamel and dentin ‘conditioning'). A total-etch adhesive (OptiBond FL, Kerr) with (AE) and without (N-AE) acid-etching and a self-etch adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond, Kuraray) were applied and a composite build-up was made (Z 100). Micro-tensile bond strength (µTBS) specimens (2 x 2 x 9 mm) were trimmed into a round cross-sectional interface (± 1 mm 2). The µTBS (MPa) was determined after 24 hours of storage in water at 37 °C. Conclusions: The total-etch adhesive bonded significantly less effective <b>to</b> <b>lased</b> than <b>to</b> bur-cut enamel/dentin.

40|$|Lidar Atmospheric Sensing Experiment (LASE) is {{the first}} fully-engineered, modular, tunable, {{autonomous}} Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) system for the remote measurement of water vapor, aerosols and clouds across the troposphere. It was designed, built and environmentally tested at LARC. LASE was designed to fly aboard a NASA/Ames ER- 2 aircraft (NASA's high altitude aircraft) and operate at altitudes from 58, 000 to 70, 000 feet. Since its first flight on May 11, 1994, it has flown 28 total missions on board the ER- 2. LASE has been validated with results showing an accuracy better than the initial requirement for vertical profiles of water vapor in the troposphere. LASE can also deploy on several other aircraft including the NASA P- 3 and will fly aboard the NASA DC- 8 during the Convection And Moisture EXperiment (CAMEX) in July-September 1998. The tunable laser system of LASE was designed to operate in a double-pulse mode at 5 Hz, with energy outputs of up to 15 OmJ per pulse in the 813 to 819 nm wavelength region and with 99 % of the output energy within a spectral interval of 1. 06 pm. Sixteen wavelengths were selected to cover the various water vapor absorption cross sections needed for the DIAL measurement. The Ti:Sapphire laser was constructed using a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser as the pump source and a single mode diode laser as a injection seeder for the Ti:Al 2 O 3 laser. We have improved the LASE instrument in several important ways. Improvements to the seed source have demonstrated that DFB laser diodes {{can be used as}} reliable seed sources on airborne DIAL instruments. The DFB diode has enabled <b>LASE</b> <b>to</b> gather more data and significantly reduced the maintenance required to insure that the system performance requirements are met.

30|$|Quantum dots (QDs) are {{promising}} for realizing fast and stable laser sources in fiber optic applications, {{due to their}} superior characteristics over conventional quantum well (QW) lasers, such as low threshold current, high internal efficiency, and infinite characteristic temperature [1, 2]. However, the high-speed performance of QDs is generally poorer than that of QWs due to several factors: slow inter-level relaxation of the carriers [3], finite density of state (DOS), and closely spaced hole energy levels [4]. Slow carrier relaxation rate, {{in combination with the}} limited DOS, will lead to early switching from ground-state (GS) <b>lasing</b> <b>to</b> excited-state (ES) <b>lasing</b> at high temperature or at high drive current. This is undesired since ES lasing reduces GS <b>lasing</b> efficiency due <b>to</b> gain saturation of the GS transition. This, due to state filling effect in discrete quantum levels, degrades the high-speed characteristics [2, 5] of the QD lasers. Furthermore, for high-speed modulation, shorter cavity length is favored. Unfortunately, transition from GS <b>to</b> ES <b>lasing</b> occurs earlier in short cavity lasers (≤ 1 mm) due to the increased cavity loss as compared to long cavity lasers [3]. Thus, to improve the high-speed performance of QD lasers, it is important to delay the onset of ES lasing. It is well-documented that p-doping of the QDs can reduce the effect of gain saturation and thus maintain GS <b>lasing</b> up <b>to</b> higher operating temperatures [1], and potentially faster relaxation time [6]. On the other hand, rapid thermal annealing (RTA) might result in intermixing of the QDs with the surrounding matrix and tunable inter-level energy. This may lead to faster inter-level relaxation of the carriers [7], and consequently, suppression of ES lasing and improved high-speed modulation efficiency. However, there exists only a handful of works on the effects of RTA on GS modulation of the annealed p-doped QD lasers [8 – 10].|$|R
