25|$|Morse Code {{cannot be}} treated as a {{classical}} radioteletype (RTTY) signal when it comes to calculating a link margin or a <b>link</b> <b>budget</b> for the simple reason of it possessing variable length dots and dashes as well as variant timing between letters and words. For the purposes of Information Theory and Channel Coding comparisons, the word PARIS is used to determine Morse Code's properties because it has an even number of dots and dashes.|$|E
25|$|In electronics, the decibel {{is often}} used to express power or {{amplitude}} ratios (gains), in preference to arithmetic ratios or percentages. One advantage is that the total decibel gain of a series of components (such as amplifiers and attenuators) can be calculated simply by summing the decibel gains of the individual components. Similarly, in telecommunications, decibels denote signal gain or loss from a transmitter to a receiver through some medium (free space, waveguide, coaxial cable, fiber optics, etc.) using a <b>link</b> <b>budget.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{limiting}} {{factor in the}} uplink of all CDMA cellular systems is the relation between uplink noise rise and intended coverage. In <b>link</b> <b>budgets,</b> noise rise is usually simply handled as a constant contribution to the background noise in logarithmic scale, {{often referred to as}} interference margin. In practice, however, it is not constant. We model the uplink noise rise as a lognormal distribution, and investigate the impact to <b>link</b> <b>budgets.</b> Simulations and numerical calculations show that the uplink noise rise variance does not critically affect the uplink capacity and coverage. System feasibility and its relation to the uplink load is also discussed. It is shown that approximative load expressions provides an upper bound on the uplink load and therefore they can be used to imply system feasibility. Furthermore, the uplink load expressions provide accurate approximations of the load given that the load is within the practical limits given by the <b>link</b> <b>budgets...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In optical {{transmission}} systems and networks with in-line optical amplifiers, system performance degradations caused by random noise and optical path distortions are usually {{thought to be}} inseparable, which makes link performance evaluation complicated. We propose to use an optical system eye-mask parameterization technique to separate noise from distortion in the <b>link</b> <b>budgeting.</b> The basic idea {{of this approach is}} to find the worst-case path distortion factor which is independent of the noise characteristics and system implementations. Both theoretical development and experimental verification are discussed. Index Terms—Distortion, optical fiber communications, optical noise, optical system <b>link</b> <b>budgeting.</b> I...|$|R

A number of transmitters can be placed around a city to create coverage that is less subject to fading than if a single transmitter were used. The satellite signal is QPSK. Both satellite and terrestrial signals have hierarchical modulation superposed on the original signal, a measure created to add bandwidth at a small expense in the satellite <b>link</b> <b>budget</b> for decoding the core audio content.|$|E
