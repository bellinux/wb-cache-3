40|$|Abstract Background The {{potential}} contribution <b>of</b> <b>allotment</b> gardens to {{a healthy}} and active life-style is increasingly recognized, especially for elderly populations. However, few studies have empirically examined beneficial effects <b>of</b> <b>allotment</b> gardening. In the present study the health, well-being and physical activity of older and younger allotment gardeners was {{compared to that of}} controls without an allotment. Methods A survey was conducted among 121 members <b>of</b> 12 <b>allotment</b> sites in the Netherlands and a control group of 63 respondents without an allotment garden living next to the home addresses <b>of</b> <b>allotment</b> gardeners. The survey included five self-reported health measures (perceived general health, acute health complaints, physical constraints, chronic illnesses, and consultations with GP), four self-reported well-being measures (stress, life satisfaction, loneliness, and social contacts with friends) and one measure assessing self-reported levels of physical activity in summer. Respondents were divided into a younger and older group at the median of 62 years which equals the average retirement age in the Netherlands. Results After adjusting for income, education level, gender, stressful life events, physical activity in winter, and access to a garden at home as covariates, both younger and older allotment gardeners reported higher levels of physical activity during the summer than neighbors in corresponding age categories. The impacts <b>of</b> <b>allotment</b> gardening on health and well-being were moderated by age. <b>Allotment</b> gardeners <b>of</b> 62 years and older scored significantly or marginally better on all measures of health and well-being than neighbors in the same age category. Health and well-being <b>of</b> younger <b>allotment</b> gardeners did not differ from younger neighbors. The greater health and well-being benefits <b>of</b> <b>allotment</b> gardening for older gardeners {{may be related to the}} finding that older allotment gardeners were more oriented towards gardening and being active, and less towards passive relaxation. Conclusions These findings are consistent with the notion that having an allotment garden may promote an active life-style and contribute to healthy aging. However, the findings may be limited by self selection and additional research is needed to confirm and extend the current findings. </p...|$|R
