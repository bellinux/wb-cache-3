Thomson passed his concepts on to Stan Cousins and Alan Ware, who assembled a <b>linear</b> <b>pinch</b> device out of old radar equipment and started operations in 1947. Follow-on experiments used large banks of capacitors to store energy that was quickly dumped into the plasma through a solenoid wrapped around a short tube. These experiments demonstrated a number of dynamic instabilities that caused the plasma to break up and hit {{the walls of the}} tube long before it was compressed or heated enough to reach the required fusion conditions.|$|E

The reduced low-dimensional wave-particle Hamiltonian is useful for describing {{the reaction of the}} accelerated ions on the wave amplitudes and phases through the self-consistent fields within the envelope approximation. As an example, the authors show for a single Alfven wave in the central plasma sheet of the Earth`s geotail, modeled by the <b>linear</b> <b>pinch</b> geometry called the Harris sheet, the time variation of the wave amplitude during the acceleration of fast protons...|$|E
40|$|Simple, {{accurate}} {{methods of}} calculating ideal MHD instability eigenvalues for infinitely long cylindrical tubes with twist function T(r) are developed. The {{results show that}} the most rapidly growing and energetic instabilities occur in the Gold-Hoyle v = 0 field, with the instability progressively weakening with increasing v. However, the maximum force eigenvalue is always small, so that even in the Gold-Hoyle case only a small proportion of the available magnetic energy can be released in the linear phase. The results also confirm that the <b>linear</b> <b>pinch</b> is remarkably weak yet relatively resistant to line-tying. It is shown that the weakness of the force eigenvalue implies that the influence of uniform gas pressure on stability is negligible. Implications for the energy-release mechanism in solar flares are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Wall plasmas, plasmas {{in contact}} with a solid wall, are studied in two basic cases. The first is a linear theta-pinch. In this {{geometry}} {{the motion of the}} plasma along the field lines and the transfer of heat along the field lines is investigated using a transient hydrodynamic heat flow model and a steady state heat flow model. Good agreement is found with experimental results on the Scylla IV-P <b>linear</b> theta <b>pinch.</b> Results of the stationary model are used to estimate linear fusion reactor lengths. Results are that linear fusion reactors would be shorter for low atomic number (Z) end walls, but have higher linear power levels (power per unit length) for high Z end walls. The second case is a stationary solution of the structure of a plasma {{in contact with}} a diverter or limiter in a tokamak. This geometry is investigated to determine relationships between plasma density, temperature and the velocity of plasma flow toward the diverter. Solutions are found and sensitivities are presented...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now well}} known that a trapped {{longitudinal}} magnetic field has a stabilizing influence on a <b>linear</b> <b>pinch.</b> Once such a stabilized pinch is set up, how-ever, diffusion will lead to mixing of the initially crossed fields; the torsion of the field lines will di-minish and the plasma may ultimately become unstable. It {{is the purpose of}} this paper to study continuous plasma and field distributions in order to see at what point instability might be expected. A variational principle has been given 1 which applies very nicely to the problem at hand. Briefly, one subjects the plasma to a displacement Ç and calculates the resulting change in the total energy, SW, of the hydromagnetic system. Stability then hinges on whether or not some can produce a diminution of the energy. If we define the vector Q = V X [Ç X B] it turns out that the change in energy is bW = Çd*x 0 - 0 - 4 т 7 J. [Q x Ç] (1) where y is the specific heat ratio and p is the pressure. The integration is taken over the complete volume. If a displacement exists which makes SW negative, we have instability. In the <b>linear</b> <b>pinch</b> we are dealing with axial symmetry and the components of the magnetic field in cylindrical coordinates are В = (0, В в, Bz). Moreover, it is assumed that Bd, Bz and p are functions of r alone. It is then possible to analyze Ç in terms of displacements of the form. Ш (2) The integration with respect to 6 and z can be carried out and bW can be minimized with respect to £e and £z by purely algebraic means.

40|$|A single fluid, two−temperature, one−dimensional {{magnetohydrodynamic}} {{model has}} been developed to describe the properties of a <b>linear</b> <b>pinch</b> plasma heated by an axially directed laser beam. The coupling of the laser light energy with the pinch dynamics is studied in detail. The laser light absorption occurs primarily through the inverse bremsstrahlung process, but the effect of enhanced absorption for sufficiently intense lasers has also been studied. Results of the calculations show a strong interaction between the heating by radial compression (pinching) and heating by the laser beam. It {{was found that the}} most important considerations in obtaining efficient heating of the plasma are the time profiles of the laser pulse and the electric current. The results of the anomalous absorption studies indicate that the increased absorption can cause the electron and ion temperatures to decouple and may actually be detrimental to the efficient laser heating of dense pinch type plasmas...|$|E
40|$|Reduced Pease-Braginskii {{currents}} {{are estimated}} for a <b>linear</b> <b>pinch</b> {{in a range}} of gases, namely, D, He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe. A characteristic depletion time is defined as the time it takes for the plasma focus (PF) pinch energy to be radiated away. This quantity is used as an indicator for expectation of radiative collapse. The depletion times in various gases are estimated in units of pinch duration. The values indicate that in D and He, the radiation powers are small, resulting in such long depletion times that no radiative collapse may be expected in the lifetime of the focus pinch. In Ne, low tens of percent are radiated and significant cooling and reduction in radius ratio may be anticipated. In Ar, Kr, and Xe, the depletion time is {{only a fraction of the}} estimated pinch duration, so radiative collapse may be expected. Numerical experiments are then carried out with a circuit-coupled code, which incorporates radiation-coupled dynamics with PF pinch elongation and plasma self-absorption. The latter eventually limits the radiated power and stops the radiative collapse. These results show the detailed dynamics and confirm the expectations arising from depletion times discussed above...|$|E
50|$|The pinch {{technique}} was patented in 1946 by George Paget Thomson and Moses Blackman, who explored both <b>linear</b> and toroidal <b>pinch</b> machines.

Tuck studied the Thomson-Blackman work and concluded {{that they would not}} reach fusion condition, but would nevertheless be interesting as an experimental system. Working at the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University, he arranged funding for an experimental device and started assembling it. Before it was complete, he was lured to the US by a job offer at the University of Chicago (Illinois).|$|R
40|$|An {{exhaustive}} {{number of}} QCD finite energy sum rules for τ-decay {{together with the}} latest updated ALEPH data is {{used to test the}} assumption of global duality. Typical checks are the absence of the dimension d= 2 condensate, the equality of the gluon condensate extracted from vector or axial vector spectral functions, the Weinberg sum rules, the chiral condensates of dimensions d= 6 and d= 8, as well as the extraction of some low-energy parameters of chiral perturbation theory. Suitable <b>pinched</b> <b>linear</b> integration kernels are introduced in the sum rules in order to suppress potential quark-hadron duality violations and experimental errors.

40|$|The Rotating Wall Machine (RoWM) is a line-tied <b>linear</b> screw <b>pinch</b> {{built to}} study current-driven {{external}} kink modes. The plasma column is formed by {{an array of}} seven electrostatic washer guns which can also be biased to drive plasma current. The array allows independent control over the electron density ne and current density Jz profiles of the column. Internal measurements of the plasma have been made with singletip Langmuir and magnetic induction (“B-dot”) probes {{for a range of}} bias currents (Ib = 0, 300, 500 A/gun). Streams from the individual guns are seen to merge at a distance of z ≈ 36 cm from the guns; the exact distance depends on the value of Ib. The density of the column is directly proportional to the Ohmic dissipation power, but the temperature stays at a low, uniform value (Te ≈ 3. 5 eV) for each bias level. Electron densities are on the order of ne ∼ 1020 m− 3. The electron density expands radially (across the Bz guide field) as the plasma moves along the column, though the current density Jz mainly stays parallel to the field lines. The singletip Langmuir probe diagnostic is difficult to analyze for Ib = 500 A/gun plasmas and fails as Ib is raised beyond this level. Spectrographic analysis of the Hα line indicates that the hydrogen plasmas are nearly fully ionized at each bias level. Azimuthal E ×B rotation is axially and radially sheared; rotation slows as the plasma reaches the anode.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedOne {{of the major}} objects of current plasma pinch research is an understanding of turbulence and its effects in enhanced diffusion rates within a pinch. As an approach to this problem, the electron beam pinch was conceived. In this experiment, an electron beam (400 kev, 0. 1 amp, 0. 1 usee, duration) enters a <b>linear</b> <b>pinch</b> at one electrode and is observed (by light from a phosphor screen) at the opposite pinch electrode. By a selection of radial positions and time of injection, the turbulent pinch configuration may be explored. Use of a probe with such small mass (as beam of electrons) may yield important information on turbulent diffusion. This report {{presents the results of}} preliminary tests and the first effort to obtain parameter dependence of the pinch configuration so that the electron beam may be properly programmed. All runs wore made at a pinch current of 200, 000 amp which, from previous experience, was assumed to be a good medium value. Initial gas pressures were varied from 25 to 400 microns of deuterium and initial z-field varied from 500 to 2000 gauss. Analysis of all runs show that pressure from particles boiled off the wall dominated over any other pressur distribution. Even for field configurations which show very little turbulence, the pressure at the wall is overpowering. Pressure distribution is improved by impressing a reversed axial field and by reducing the magnitude of the pinch current. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|At {{this first}} {{opportunity}} for open scientific dis-cussions {{on this subject}} we look forward with eagerness to exchanging experiences with others and hearing of the courses taken towards the common goal in the various laboratories of the world. Early Development At this laboratory, the peculiarly intriguing {{nature of the problem}} and the admirable consequences of its solution have long been recognized. Lively discussions of such matters as plasma drift in a torus and its effect on achieving a laboratory thermonuclear reac-tion occurred between Fermi, Kerst, Landshoff, Teller, R. R. Wilson and the writer in 1946, and an unsuccessful search for neutrons from colliding Munroe jets of metal deuterides was made at about the same time, based on an earlier paper by Ulam and the writer. When the subject was reopened in 1951, the toroidal pinch (as proposed, with a superimposed Bz field, by the writer in 1948) was selected as the confinement geometry for initial study and it passed through the usual vicissitudes and modifications— instability, <b>linear</b> dynamic <b>pinches</b> (Columbus), rf pinches, so called Bz and wall stabilized pinches; while parallel speculations and experimental forays were made into cusped geometries (Picket Fence), spinning plasmas, shocks in axial and convergent geometries and magnetic mirrors. Our ideas and plans have undergone profound changes during the last seven years and are in process of undergoing another. As little as half a year ago, the chief obstacle to the achievement of a thermonuclear reaction via the stabilized pinch appeared to be contamination of the plasma by foreign atoms sputtered or evaporated off the walls. Doubtless this particular obstacle is still there, but in the meantime a crevasse has opened at our feet, in the form of our new experimental observa-tions of high energy losses from the pinched plasma. If these turn out to be due to the newly predicted surface hydromagnetic instabilities, then we know how to overcome these and the outlook may be better than ever. If the losses turn out to be due to plasm...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT {{notice that}} there is a {{fundamental}} difference between optimiza-tion and improvement. Optimization in a general sense invol-ves the determination of a highest or lowest value over some range. For the mathematician optimization is to find the max-imum or minimum value of a given function in a region. Certain conditions must be met, e. g. the func ion must be continuous at the point in question, and the optimum is a well defined concept. In engineering we usually consider economic optimization, which usually means minimizing the cost of a given process or product, i. e. we need a well defined objective function. It is also important not to be mislead by a local op-timum, which may occur for strongly non <b>linear</b> relations. In <b>pinch</b> technique there is no objective function. Thus, pinch technology is just a method to improve the design of HEN un-der specified restrictions discussed below. A comparison between exergy anal sis and pinch techno-logy is performed by studying systems wh re threshold pro-blems occur and heat pumps are available. Pinch technology is shown to be a poor method in these cas s. Instead exergy ana-lysis is recommended. Methods such as energy utility dia-grams and thermoeconomic optimization are recommended to improve the structure and to optimize the operation of sys-tems, i. e. design of systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{toroidal}} {{version of}} the hard-core pinch tube is created by levitating a ring conductor inside a toroidal shell. The magnitude of induced H/ sub theta / necessary for levi-tation is small in terms of field strengths normally desired for energetic pinches. In a 3 -in. glass-and-copper toroid of square cross section a 3 / 4 -in. hollow copper ring has been levitated with a 60 - cycle current of 3 kiloamperes. A 12 -in stainless steel tube of round cross section is being built. The stability of nearvacuum field hard-core configurations is best investigated in toroidal geometry. At high power levels and low plasma densities, the conventional toroidal stabilized pinch'' is subject to an anomalous plasma energy leakage to the wall, which cannot {{be explained by the}} observed ultraviolet radiation alone. A critical question is, therefore, whether the relative stability of some hard-core pinches, as reflected by the smoothness and reproducibility of magnetic probe traces, is reflected by an improved containment of the plasma en-ergy leading to high temperature. A toroidal hard-core tube is also useful in studying the nature of the nonhydromagnetic instabilities observed in the <b>linear</b> inverse stabilized <b>pinch.</b> '' The presence and condition of electrodes appear to have a substantial effect on the magnitude of these instabilities, as would be expected if they were, for instance, of electrostatic origin. In order to complement the plasma study of the hard-core pinch, we have developed an analogue method using sodium tubes to simulate the current-carrying layer. In this way the purely hydromagnetic aspect of the plasma behavior can be isolated. (auth...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} modulational {{instability}} of geophysical Rossby and plasma drift waves within the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima (CHM) model both theoretically, using truncated (four-mode and three-mode) models, and numerically, using direct simulations of CHM equation in the Fourier space. The linear theory predicts instability for any amplitude {{of the primary}} wave. For strong primary waves the most unstable modes are perpendicular to the primary wave, which correspond to generation of a zonal flow if the primary wave is purely meridional. For weaker waves, the maximum growth occurs for off-zonal inclined modulations. For very weak primary waves the unstable waves are close to being in three-wave resonance with the primary wave. The nonlinear theory predicts that the zonal flows generated by the <b>linear</b> instability experience <b>pinching</b> into narrow zonal jets. Our numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions of the linear theory {{as well as of}} the nonlinear pinching. We find that, for strong primary waves, these narrow zonal jets further roll up into Karman-like vortex streets. On the other hand, for weak primary waves, the growth of the unstable mode reverses and the system oscillates between a dominant jet and a dominate primary wave. The 2 D vortex streets appear to be more stable than purely 1 D zonal jets, and their zonal-averaged speed can reach amplitudes much stronger than is allowed by the Rayleigh-Kuo instability criterion for the 1 D case. We find that the truncation models work well for both the linear stage and and often even for the medium-term nonlinear behavior. In the long term, the system transitions to turbulence helped by the vortex-pairing instability (for strong waves) and by the resonant wave-wave interactions (for weak waves).
