50|$|There is good {{evidence}} from experimental animals that a traction force {{is unlikely to}} be involved in tooth eruption: Animals treated with <b>lathyrogens</b> that interfere with collagen cross-link formation showed similar eruption rates to control animals, provided occlusal forces were removed.|$|E
5000|$|If these {{crosslinks}} are not formed, as in {{the case}} of osteolathyrism, the synthesis of strong mesenchymal and mesodermal tissue is inhibited. Symptoms of osteolathyrism include weakness and fragility of connective tissue (i.e., skin, bones, and blood vessels (angiolathyrism) and the paralysis of the lower extremities associated with neurolathyrism. For these reasons, compounds containing <b>lathyrogens</b> should be avoided during pregnancy and growth of a child.|$|E
40|$|An {{apparent}} {{relationship between}} locoism and lathyrism was investigated. Similarities {{reported in the}} literature in botanical relationship, signs produced in affected animals, and chemical characteristics were noted. It was demonstrated that the known <b>lathyrogens,</b> aminoacetonitrile and α, γ-diaminobutyric acid, as well as an extract from the loco plant (expected to contain <b>lathyrogens</b> if present in the plant) produced many of the abortive, teratogenic and neurologic effects and signs evident in animals in true locoism. Preliminary assay of extracts from the plant suggested the presence of <b>lathyrogens</b> in the loco plant...|$|E
40|$|The vitamin B- 6 {{antimetabolite}} 4 -deoxypyridoxine, when {{injected into}} 13 -day chick embryos, {{has the effect}} of increasing the amount of collagen solubilized from the leg bones by buffered saline solutions, 24 h after the injection. This effect is similar to, but less marked than, that produced by the administration of the <b>lathyrogen</b> beta-amino-propionitrile. Since that fraction of the total collagen which is solubilized by saline represents the least-cross-linked pool, it is concluded that 4 -deoxypyridoxine is a <b>lathyrogen,</b> decreasing the cross-linking in the developing embryo, and confirming the importance of vitamin B- 6 in that process. Lysyl oxidase, the cross-linking enzyme, was measured in extracts made from the epiphysial cartilages of embryos 24 h after the injection of either 4 -deoxypyridoxine or beta-aminopropionitrile. The injection of 5 mg of beta-aminopropionitrile causes the lysyl oxidase activity to fall to 61 % of that of saline-injected controls; after treatment with 4 -deoxypyridoxine, the activity is 74 % of the control value. In the latter case, full activity is not restored to the extracts by preincubation with pyridoxal phosphate. The results are discussed in relation to the early development of the connective tissues...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} of the gross anatomical deviations in malformed offspring from ewes that ingested the locoweed plant or a synthetic <b>lathyrogen</b> during gestation revealed many similarities but also certain essential differences. Similarities included abortions, contracture or overextension of the pastern joint, permanent flexure of the carpal joint, lateral rotation of the forelimbs, osteoporosis and bone fragility, and brachygnathia. Features restricted to the lathyrogen-induced condition included spinal malformations of various kinds especially scoliosis but occasionally kyphosis and torticollis, and forelimb abduction resulting from loose scapular attachment. The loose or hypermobile stifle joint of the loco-induced condition was rare in malformed offspring from lathyrogen-fed animals...|$|R
40|$|Primate {{arterial}} {{smooth muscle}} cells and skin fibroblasts were examined {{for their ability}} to synthesize elastin in culture. In the presence of the <b>lathyrogen</b> beta-aminopropionitrile, the smooth muscle cells incorporate [3 H]lysine into a lysyl oxidase substrate that was present in the medium and associated with the cell layer. A component having a mol wt of 72, 000 and an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of authentic tropoelastin was isolated from the labeled smooth muscle cells by coacervation and fractionation with organic solvents. In the absence of beta-aminopropionitrile, long-term cultures of smooth muscle cells incorporated [14 C]lysine into desmosine and isodesmosine, the cross-link amino acids unique to elastin. In contrast, no desmosine formation occurred in the fibroblast cultures. These characteristics demonstrate that arterial smooth muscle cells are capable of synthesizing both soluble and cross-lined elastin in culture...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lathyrogens</b> {{decrease}} collagen and elastin cross-linking by inhibiting lysine oxidase. The <b>lathyrogens</b> isoniazid and semicarbazide decrease liver {{pyridoxal phosphate}} and are teratogenic; all their effects are reversed by pyridoxal. beta-Aminopropionitrile, another lathyrogen, {{does not affect}} liver pyridoxal phosphate, and its lathyrogenic and teratogenic effects are not reversed by pyridoxal. Time courses of these effects differ greatly, suggesting enzyme inhibition by different mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Maternal {{feeding of}} the lathyrogen aminoacetonitrile, the range plant Lupinus caudatus, and an extract of this plant — {{expected}} to contain <b>lathyrogens</b> if {{present in the}} plant — all produced clinically similar congenital defects in calves.

The results suggest a possible relationship between lathyrism and lupine-induced crooked calf disease...|$|E
40|$|Using {{the chick}} embryo assay system, {{a series of}} organic {{compounds}} was tested for lathyrogenic activity; lathyrogenic compounds were shown to fall into 4 groups—nitriles, ureides, and 2 new groups—hydrazides and hydrazines, forming a spectrum of diminishing potency {{in their ability to}} produce solubility of collagen and skeletal deformities. Pyridoxal was seen to reverse to a great degree the effects on collagen solubility and skeletal deformity produced by the ureides and hydrazides, though not by the nitriles; its effect was considered to be due to the formation of a Schiff's complex between the aldehyde and the terminal amine of the lathyrogen. Evidence is presented to show that <b>lathyrogens</b> do not act as inhibitors of monoamine oxidases or as chelate-forming agents, nor, in the case of isoniazid, as an anti-nicotinamide agent...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the role of neutrophils (PMNs) in the pathogenesis of emphysema. After administration of CdCl 2 intratracheally to hamsters fed a <b>lathyrogen,</b> beta-amino propionitrile fumarate (BAPN), the classic lesions of emphysema developed. Administration of specific antineutrophil serum markedly reduced the PMN influx into the lungs which followed CdCl 2 exposure and produced a substantial decrease in elastase and collagenase content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL). The degree of emphysema in PMN-depleted hamsters given BAPN and CdCl 2 was not different from that in hamsters given BAPN and CdCl 2. Furthermore, the degree of acute lung injury following CdCl 2, as determined by hydroxyproline content of BAL and by lung lipid peroxidation, was the same in PMN-depleted and non-depleted groups. Thus, PMNs were not necessary for the induction of emphysema in BAPN-CdCl 2 -treated hamsters. The results suggest that PMNs may not be obligate mediators of emphysema...|$|R
40|$|Cultured {{vascular}} endothelium secretes the enzyme lysyl oxidase which cross-links both collagen and elastin. The major reducible cross-link synthesized by cultured human umbilical arterial and venous endothelium is dihydroxylysinonorleucine (di-OH-LNL). Treatment of the cultures with the <b>lathyrogen</b> beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), which inhibits lysyl oxidase, inhibited synthesis of this cross-link. Cultured porcine aortic endothelium synthesized three major reducible lysine-derived cross-links: dihydroxylysinonorleucine (di-OH-LNL), hydroxylysinonorleucine (OH-LNL) and lysinonorleucine (LNL); BAPN also inhibited synthesis {{of these three}} cross-links. Earlier in-vivo observations on BAPN-treated chick embryos had shown a 20 % increase in the hydration of cartilage and other tissues; the likeliest explanation was that cross-link disruption permitted the proteoglycans in cartilage to express their hydrophilic nature when freed of their collagenous network. Capillary basement membrane contains laminin, proteoglycan and type IV collagen. Following the finding of oedema in lathyritic cartilage, we would propose that agents which disrupt collagen cross-links in cultured {{vascular endothelium}}, damaging capillary basement membrane, be considered as one possible mechanism in the pathogenesis of oedema...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral aneurysms were induced in rats, {{later in}} monkeys too, by ligating the common carotid artery on one side, making the animals hypertensive, and feeding them the <b>lathyrogen</b> Q -aminopropionitrile. On {{analysis}} of this animal model, hemodynamic stress, hypertension and metabolic disorder of connective tissue proved to be of primary importance as etiological factors. The experimentally induced aneurysms resemble those in man both in location and in microscopic structureThe initial change leading {{to the formation of}} aneurysms occurred on the distal side of the major branch adjacent to the apex, and distal to the intimal pad. The most interesting finding was that there was no apparent intimal proliferation responding to wall injury at the site of aneurysmal development. We hypothesized that the loss of proliferative response to intimal injury was the essential part of aneurysm development. By giving the animals blood coagulation factor XIII, induced aneurysms were filled with proliferated smooth muscle cells and collagen. This might be a proof of our hypothesis and this result indicates a nonsurgical therapeutic way of the disease in the future...|$|R
40|$|Osteolathyrism is an {{experimental}} disease {{which may be}} produced {{in a variety of}} animals by treating them with one of various compounds; the resulting lesions include skeletal deformity and aortic aneurysm. One of the major effects appears to be a weakening of intermolecular collagen bonding which manifests as an increase in the fragility of various collagenous tissues and in the extractibility of salt-soluble collagen from these tissues (1). Interest in this condition lies in its use as {{an experimental}} model with which to study the extracellular behaviour of fibrous tissue, as well as a possible means for the delay or prevention of its deposition. At present data concerning the functional groups in normal collagen which are responsible for its polymerisation, are incomplete; the present study explores the possibility that lathyrogenic agents may act on certain of these functional groups thus impairing normal polymerisation. Theoretically considered, <b>lathyrogens</b> must act at one or more of three points during the formation of collagen [...] -on the fibroblast, during synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Toxic {{components}} of natural foodstuffs are discussed, with special reference to <b>lathyrogens,</b> pressor amines, azoxyglycosides, and labile sulfur compounds. The osteolathyrogen, γ-glutamyl-β-aminopropionitrile, in sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus) seeds induces skeletal deformities and aortic rupture, probably by interfering with normal maturation of collagen fibres. Neurolathyrism in man {{may be caused}} by β-N-oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid, a neurotoxin recently identified in Lathyrus sativus seeds. Histamine, tyramine, noradrenaline, serotonin and other pressor amines occur in fruits and fermented foods such as bananas, pineapples, cheese and wine. Consumption of such foods by patients taking monoamine oxidase-inhibiting drugs (e. g. tranylcypromine) may produce serious hypertensive crises. Cycad nuts, widely used as human food in tropical and subtropical areas, contain a potent carcinogen, methyl azoxymethanol, which is more or less removed prior to use by leaching in water. Consumption of plants of the onion, cabbage and cress families introduces into the body such toxic chemicals as benzyl cyanide, goitrin and thiocyanates. The lachrymatory substance in onions is propenyl sulfenic acid...|$|E
40|$|Mice with alleles at the X-chromosomal locus, Mottled, have {{connective}} tissue abnormalities that are, in many respects, {{similar to those}} found in lathyritic animals. Like animals raised on <b>lathyrogens,</b> these mice have aortic aneurysms, reduced tensile strength of the skin, and bone abnormalities (1). Data is presented to indicate that the low tensile strength is due to impaired formation of cross-links in collagen and elastin, and that cross-linking is defective because of failure to generate lysine-derived aldehydes (allysine) required for cross-link formation. The mottled alleles are coat-color genes on the X-chromosome of the mouse (2). There are at least six alleles at this locus. Mice with the wild-type allele have a normal coat color (black) while those with the other five alleles have coats of gray and are called Tortoise (To), Dappled (ModP), Brindled (Mobr), Viable Brindled (Mo*bo, and Blotchy (Blo). I Heterozygous females have a mosaic coat color while the hemizygous males have a uniform coat color. It was in part from study of the coat color pattern of these mice that Lyon hypothesized random X-chromosome inactivation (3) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} lathyrogenic agents in vivo and in vitro are described, {{in respect to}} some {{biochemical}} indices of cartilage metabolism. Lathyrogenic agents in vivo inhibited the incorporation of radiosulfate into rat epiphyseal cartilage and the isolated chondroitin sulfate. No significant changes in hydroxyproline or hexosamine content of epiphyseal cartilage were found, {{but there was a}} marked increase in water content. The content of chondroitin sulfate, measured as uronic acid, was decreased. The importance of taking growth rate differences between control and experimental rats into account in assessing the effects of lathyrogenic agents in vivo is emphasized. In an in vitro system, utilizing fresh calf costal cartilage slices, the presence of low concentrations of lathyrogenic agents markedly affected various metabolic events. The incorporation into cartilage slices of sulfate-S 35, glucose-U-C 14, and glycine- 1 -C 14 was significantly depressed, as was the production of organic acids, including lactic acid. In general, these effects were more severe under anaerobic conditions. Glutamine restored the activities of the slices treated with lathyrogenic agents to control values obtained in the absence of either <b>lathyrogen</b> or glutamine...|$|R
40|$|Semicarbazide, a <b>lathyrogen,</b> {{was given}} to growing rats to {{elucidate}} the consequences of altering the molecular structure of fibrous proteins within the lung. Static pressure-volume (P-V) measurements during deflation of saline-filled lungs showed normal recoil pressure and compliance values within the physiological range of lung volume. Quasi-static P-V measurements were also normal during slow reinflation, even beyond physiological limits to a recoil pressure of 20 cm H 20. However, the lungs of experimental rats ruptured at much lower recoil pressures than controls. Histology was normal in lungs fixed at 20 cm H 20. In contrast, lungs showed dilation of terminal air spaces, rupture of alveolar walls, {{and an increase in}} mean linear intercept in experimental compared with control specimens, when fixed at 30 cm H 20. Biochemical analyses revealed reduced cross-linking of lung collagen without change in its total content. There were no detectable changes in the quantity or quality of lung elastin. It is concluded that semicarbazide may selectively impair the maturation of lung collagen and that immaturity of lung collagen is associated with a reduction in the tensile strength of lung tissue, without changes in elasticity within physiological volume limits...|$|R
40|$|The lathyrogenic {{effect of}} INAH in the chick embryo may be {{measured}} by {{the increase in the}} extractibility of collagen from the bones with 1 M NaCl. Incubation of these bones in vitro with carbonyl compounds diminishes the amount of extractible collagen; with D-L-glyceraldehyde the reversal of the INAH effect is complete. This reversal effect is dependent on the time and temperature of incubation and on the quantity of D-L-glyceraldehyde, but is independent of the pH of the incubating medium, the optical form of the glyceraldehyde, or the metabolism of the cells; this suggests that it depends on a simple chemical combination. D-L-glyceraldehyde also reverses completely the extractibility of collagen from the bones of embryos rendered lathyrogenic with BAPN, semicarbazide, and hydrazine hydrate. The hypothesis has been advanced "that lathyrogenic agents act by blocking carbonyl groups on the collagen molecule, thus preventing cross-linking essential to normal maturation; normal maturation may be restored by the addition of carbonyl groups which act by competing either for the <b>lathyrogen</b> or for functional sites on the collagen molecule. " In support of this hypothesis, {{it has been shown that}} purified lathyritic guinea pig collagen takes up lesser amounts of 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine—a compound which combines with carbonyl groups—than does normal collagen; it has been shown that lathyritic collagen still possesses the ability to form segment-long-spacing (SLS) collagen, but that these fibres are much thinner than normal; this is due perhaps to blockade of groups essential for lateral cross-linking of the tropocollagen unit. It has also been shown that normal, purified guinea pig collagen which has been pretreated with INAH, takes up lesser amounts of 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine and forms much thinner SLS fibres than the untreated controls...|$|R
40|$|Collagen {{protein is}} {{generally}} regarded as having a small turnover in the adult; in certain situations however, such as the return to normal of the postpartum uterus of the rat (1) or the remodelling of a badly aligned healing fracture of long bone, collagen fibrils are resorbed, but the mechanisms involved remain elusive. Since one {{of the effects of}} lathyrogenic agents is thought to be a loosening of intermolecular collagen bonding (2, 3), lathyrism provides a potentially useful means with which to study the process of the disorgaz 3 ization of the collagen fibril. One such study on the metabolism of C 14 -nitrile-labelled aminoacetonitrile in the weanling rat (4) showed a wide distribution of the labelled carbon, the major part of which however remained unidentified. A later study of the metabolism of labelled fl-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) led to the identification of the major metabolic product, cyanoacetic acid, itself non-lathyrogenic, but the nature of the active molecule and its site of action remain unknown (5 - 7). Attempts to seek common chemical denominators among known <b>lathyrogens</b> (8, 9), have met with little success {{with the exception of one}} stud...|$|E
40|$|WHEN {{an attempt}} to restore {{function}} {{by means of a}} tendon graft fails to give the desired results, the reason is practically always the formation of adhesions between the tendon and the surrounding tissue. Since this process is essential for the vascularisation of the graft, it must not be prevented but an attempt can be made to influence the nature of the adhesions in order to limit the functional restrictions caused by them. Basically, the formation of collagenous adhesions may be modified in two ways: by the administration of drugs or by the induction of a tendon sheath. Methods to control a natural healing process by administration of drugs are still in an experimental stage. The appropriate drugs (<b>lathyrogens)</b> are capable of changing the physical characteristics of collagen in a specific manner. Results of experiments with one of these drugs (beta-amino-proprio-nitril) are promising (Peacock, 1968). In this paper we are mainly concerned with the second approach. The capacity of cell-poor tissue to form collagen is rather limited. Since the tendon sheath has a small number of cells, the grafting of a tendon in an intact sheath would seem to offer advantages {{in the form of a}} collagen-poor adhesion formation with little limitation o...|$|E
40|$|Methods {{controlling}} tissue fibrosis {{are classified}} into those specifically inhibiting various metabolic asnects of collagen selectively in the injured tissue (ascorbic acid deficiency, effect of agent chelating Fe 2 +, proline analogs, <b>lathyrogens).</b> The most promising method {{seems to be}} the blocking of crosslinks formation among collagen molecules by,l-aminopropionitrile, a competitive inhibitor of a crosslinking enzyme, lysyl oxidase. The second group of methods is called nonspecific, as they affect any stage of inflammatory process preceding the activation of fibroblasts. The importance of activated macrophages in the stimulation of fibroblast is discussed. Finally, a new concept is proposed, indicating the function of zinc ions in the control of the integrity of biomembrances, tissue reactivity to noxious agents. It is suggested that zinc may control NADPH dependent lipid peroxidation at the membrane level by inhibiting NADPH oxidase activity. The implication of these ideas to lung fibrosis induced by silica or asbestos is discussed. I would like to focus attention on two topics of great importance to all of us who are involved in problems of fibrogenesis and tissue injury. The first topic deals with the pharmacological control of the abnormal deposition of collagen in forms of various fibrotic, cirrhotic, or sclerotic lesions. To this category belongs lung fibrosis after fibrogenic dusts. The second topic will deal with the role of various metals in the development of tissue injury with several implications related to metallic ions adjacent to the asbestos fiber...|$|E
40|$|Solubilized {{interstitial}} collagens {{will form}} a fibrillar, gel-like lattice when brought to physiologic conditions. In {{the presence of}} human dermal fibroblasts the collagen lattice will contract. The rate of contraction can be determined by computer-assisted planemetry. The mechanisms involved in contraction are as yet unknown. Using this system {{it was found that}} the rate of contraction was markedly decreased when collagen lacking telopeptides was substituted for native collagen. Histidinohydroxylysinonorleucine (HHL) is a major stable trifunctional collagen cross-link in mature skin that involves a carboxyl terminal, telopeptide site 16 c, the sixteenth amino acid residue from the carboxy terminal of the telopeptide region of alpha 1 (I) in type I collagen. Little, if any, HHL was present in native, purified, reconstituted, soluble collagen fibrils from 1 % acetic acid-extracted 2 -year-old bovine skin. In contrast, HHL cross-links were present (0. 22 moles of cross-link per mole of collagen) in lattices of the same collagen contracted by fibroblasts. However, rat tail tendon does not contain HHL cross-links, and collagen lattices made of rat tail tendon collagen are capable of contraction. This suggests that telopeptide sites, and not mature HHL cross-links per se, are essential for fibroblasts to contract collagen lattices. Beta-aminopropionitrile fumarate (BAPN), a potent <b>lathyrogen</b> that perturbs collagen cross-linking by inhibition of lysyl oxidase, also inhibited the rate of lattice cell contraction in lattices composed of native collagen. However, the concentrations of BAPN that were necessary to inhibit the contraction of collagen lattices also inhibited fibroblast growth suggestive of cellular toxicity. In accordance with other studies, we found no inhibition of the rate of lattice contraction when fibronectin-depleted serum was used. Electron microscopy of contracted gels revealed typical collagen fibers with a characteristic axial periodicity. The data provide evidence that collagen telopeptide sites play a role in collagen gel lattice contraction...|$|R
40|$|Grains such as {{wheat and}} barley, {{combined}} with legumes and oilseed meals, provide {{not only the}} bulk of essential nutrients for commercial poultry production and reproduction, but are also the prime source of anti-nutritive components, which {{are likely to have}} significant bearing on how effectively all dietary components are utilised by poultry. Sources of variation in the physical and chemical characteristics of grains used in poultry diets include variety, seasonal effects, and growth sites, crop treatment and grain fumigants, and post-harvest storage conditions and period of storage. The available energy and protein contents of grains fed to poultry, which best represent nutritive value, are extremely wide and in consequence there is an urgent need to develop rapid and objective tests for the assessment of nutritive value prior to including grains in poultry diets. Variation in the available energy and protein content of grains can be attributed {{to a wide range of}} anti-nutritive factors such as non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), enzyme activity, tannins, alkyl resorcinols, protease inhibitors, α-amylase inhibitors, phytohaemagglutinins, alkaloids, saponins, and <b>lathyrogens.</b> The relative importance of such factors will also differ according to the type of grain in question. However, NSP seem to be the predominant factor in Australia over the past few years given the volume of published literature on this topic. This argument is strongly supported by the fact that NSP-degrading enzymes are routinely used in monogastric diets with great success throughout the world. Numerous attempts over a long period have failed to provide unequivocal evidence that nutritive value in grains for poultry can be predicted with sufficient accuracy and precision by simple, low-cost physico-chemical measurements used singly or in combination. Nevertheless, it is highly desirable to continue to explore these simple measurements in the expectation that useful statistical relationships with more complex measurements will emerge, or that simple measurements can be used to fine-tune prediction equations based on more powerful techniques such as near infrared spectrophotometry. Finally, the nutritive value of grains for poultry will be determined not only by the chemical and physical properties of grains but also by the way that these interact with the processes of ingestion, digestion, absorption, and metabolism in birds. For this reason it is imperative that plant and animal scientists join forces to improve the nutritive value of plant material as feed for animals for the benefit of grain growers and producers of livestock...|$|E
