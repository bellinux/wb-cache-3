50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, elicitins are {{a family}} of small, highly conserved proteins secreted by phytopathogenic microorganisms belonging to the Phytophthora and Pythium species. They are toxic proteins responsible for inducing a necrotic and systemic hypersensitive response in plants from the Solanaceae and Cruciferae families. <b>Leaf</b> <b>necrosis</b> provides immediate control of fungal invasion and induces systemic acquired resistance; both responses mediate basic protection against subsequent pathogen inoculation.|$|E
50|$|The first {{symptoms}} of hopperburn {{is that a}} leaflets margins start to curl up. As a plants infestation increases, its leaves cup downward, and they start to turn from green to yellow. In severe infestations this leads to <b>leaf</b> <b>necrosis</b> in which the leaf margins and intervein areas turn brown. Older plants completely lose their leaves. Young plants display tip-wilting and will be stunted in height. Plants that were damaged by stem feeding suffered more damage to their physiologies than those which were damaged by leaf eating.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} shown that the PVY has {{different}} isolates according to the symptoms they induce in various potato plant species. Extensive biological, serological and molecular variability of PVY isolates makes the classification of isolates as particular strains particularly difficult. Occurrence of a variety of symptoms and the emergence of the necrotic PVYNTN has led to a search for more reliable classification tools than simple serological identification. Traditionally three chief strains of PVY are recognized: PVYC, PVYN and PVYO. PVYC, originally known as Potato Virus C, was the first to be recognized and was identified in the 1930s. PVYC induces hypersensitive responses {{in a wide range of}} potato cultivars. These reactions include the formation of mild mosaic patterns or stipple streak. Unlike the other strains of PVY, some PVYC strains are non-aphid transmissible. Previous studies by Visser et al. did not identify any of the local isolates as being PVYC but it has been reported to occur to in South Africa. A second strain of PVY is PVYN. Some notes on suspected variant of Solanum virus 2 (Potato virus Y). This strain was described in tobacco plants growing close to potato plants. PVYN results in <b>leaf</b> <b>necrosis</b> and mild or even no damage to the tubers. The ordinary strain of PVY is denoted as PVYO. Infection of a potato plant with the PVYO strain results in mild tuber damage and does not cause <b>leaf</b> <b>necrosis.</b> Both PVYN and PVYO are aphid transmissible and occur in South Africa. In Europe these two strains have been shown to have recombined to form PVYNTN. The PVYNTN has been accredited with the ability to induce potato tuber necrotic ringspot disease (PTNRD). Tubers damaged by PTNRD become unmarketable and infection by PVYNTN thus results in a larger economic impact than infection by the other strains.|$|E
50|$|Phytophthora kernoviae infect through {{release and}} wind {{dispersal}} of zoospores. It {{is quick to}} take advantage of wounds already present on its host, but does not require the host to be injured. One interesting aspect of P. kernoviae is that in one study, only two thirds of typical infections were symptomatic, making it easy for this pathogen and infection to go unnoticed from typical visual inspection. Before infecting the inner bark of European Beach trees, the pathogen causes <b>leaf</b> <b>necrosis</b> and the dieback of shoots in the under-foliage of the forest along with ornamental species. It is here where the sporulation occurs on the infected shoots and foliage, and is able to cause infection of the surrounding trees, giving rise to bleeding cankers on the stems. This pathogen's adaption for aerial dispersal is a key factor in its transmission from initial ornamental host to tree species.|$|E
50|$|Pseudomonas viridiflava is a {{bacteria}} {{that has been}} claimed to cause disease in hellebores in New Zealand, among other plants. The bacterial disease manifested on hellebore plants {{in the form of}} black <b>leaf</b> spots, <b>necrosis</b> petal, and stem lesions. The most popular ornamental and commercial crop grown in New Zealand is the Helleborus orientalis and it's hybrids, of which 90% of the H. orientalis in the Tauranga nursery contracted the disease after several days of moderate rainfall. The disease caused discoloration in the form of: black leaf spots on the plant that were circular and about 1.5-2mm in diameter, black stem lesions, and dry, grey to brown lesions with distinct margins on the flower petals. The symptoms were different from other leaf-spotting hellebore diseases, such as those caused by the fungus Coniothyrium and the bacteria Xanthomonas The case in New Zealand is the only reported case of P. viridiflava infecting hellebores so far, but on other plants P. viridiflava has been reported to also induce symptoms such as leaf rot, <b>leaf</b> blotch, stem <b>necrosis</b> and blossom blight.|$|R

50|$|Since Phytophthora kernoviae {{has such}} serious {{symptoms}} {{it should be}} seen as a serious threat to both trees and shrubs. On the shrubs of Rhododendron, the disease starts with the blackening of the leaf petiole sometimes extending {{to the base of the}} leaf this affects old and young leaves equally. In addition to this darkening lesion on the stem, leaves can get severe enough lesions to become necrotic and cause entire leaf death.These lesions begin as a progressive blackening of the leaf tissue and spread across the leaf surface. This necrosis in some cases causes dieback and cankers on the infected plant. While symptoms for trees hosts are similar they have a few distinct differences. For the European beech (Fagus sylvatica) host symptoms include dark brown to blue black lesions on the trunk ranging in size and shape depending on severity of the infection. Tulip trees Liriodendron tulipifera are another susceptible host. The pathogen infects and causes many smaller bleeding lesions along the trunk and can even cause lesions on leaf tips. Both shrubs and trees share the characteristic symptoms of <b>leaf</b> <b>necrosis</b> with lesions on the stem and trunk proving the severity of this disease.|$|E

40|$|Reaction {{of tobacco}} and rice leaf tissue {{infiltrated}} with either st. rains of Burkholderia glumae or B. gladioli was investigated. Visual alteration areas of tobacco leaf at sites infiltrated with high concentration (more than 10 ⁷ cells/ml) {{of the bacteria}} were categorized into two types, one causing necrosis with hypersensitive-like reaction (HLR) within 24 hr of infiltration, and the other developing only yellowish discoloration. Living bacterial cells and the toxoflavin were effective for necrosis induction, whereas heat-killed celis, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) were ineffective. In the case of B. glumae, necrosis occurred with toxoflavin producing strains. No necrotic lesions developed with toxoflavin non-producing strains. All strains of B. gladioli induced necrosis with water soaking lesions in tobacco leaf.

40|$|AAL-toxin causes severe {{necrosis}} in {{leaves of}} susceptible tomato cultivars at nanomolar concentrations. In resistant omato cultivars harbouring the semi-dominant Alternaria stem canker resistance locus necrosis is also observed, however at much higher toxin concentrations, in both lines {{the percentage of}} the leaf area exhibiting necrosis is dependent on toxin concentration and on length of toxin exposure. However, at the same toxin concentration, periods of toxin exposure resulting in similar necrosis are much longer for the resistant than for the susceptible tomato. It was demonstrated that toxin uptake in the leaves does not imply toxin uptake in the cells since a discrepancy was observed between death of protoplasts, isolated from leaves cut for protoplast isolation immediately after incubation on AAL-toxin and necrosis in leaves when further incubated on water. However. when after exposure to AAL-toxin leaves were further incubated on water for 24 h before they were cut for protoplast isolation, a correlation was found between <b>leaf</b> <b>necrosis</b> and death of protoplasts. This suggests that further transport is needed in leaves after toxin uptake, bringing toxin to all the cells, that cannot occur in leaves cut for protoplast isolation. Light {{plays an important role in}} AAL-toxin induced necrosis and it was shown that length of light exposure controls necrosis development like toxin concentration and length of toxin exposure.

40|$|Introduction of and {{invasion}} by alien plant pathogens represents {{the main cause}} of emerging infectious diseases affecting domesticated and wild plant species worldwide. The trade in living plants is the most common pathway of introduction. Many of the alien tree pathogens recently introduced into Europe were not previously included on any quarantine lists. To help determine the potential risk of pest introduction through trading of ornamental plants, a sentinel nursery was established in Beijing, China in 2008. The sentinel nursery planting included four of the most common ornamental woody species shipped to Europe including Ilex cornuta var. fortunae, Zelkova schneideriana, Fraxinus chinensis and Buxus microphylla. Symptoms developing on these species within the sentinel nursery were detected in 2013 and consisted of necrotic spots on leaves, canker and stem necrosis, shoot blight and shoot necrosis. Fungi associated with the trees and their symptoms included Alternaria alternata detected from all hosts; Diaporthe liquidambaris and Diaporthe capsici from bark and <b>leaf</b> <b>necrosis</b> of Zelkova schneideriana; Botryosphaeria dothidea and Nothophoma quercina from stem cankers on Fraxinus chinensis and <b>leaf</b> <b>necrosis</b> on Ilex cornuta; and Pseudonectria foliicola from <b>leaf</b> <b>necrosis</b> on Buxus microphylla.

These phytoalexins were strictly analysed at infection sites. In the susceptible Chasselas, P. viticola colonises, at 72 h post-infection (hpi), all of the spongy mesophyll with functional haustoria and produces mainly the non toxic piceide. No necrotic zone was observed on Chasselas leaves. The ultrastructural response to downy mildew infection is different in each of the other three resistant grape cultivars. In Solaris, where <b>leaf</b> <b>necrosis</b> are rapidly induced, the infection is restricted to {{the upper part of the}} loose spongy mesophyll, and associated with a rapid cell wall disruption and the dispersion of cytoplasmic content along with the production of viniferins. In IRAC 2091, <b>leaf</b> <b>necrosis</b> are quite similar to those observed on Solaris but the infected plant cell, as well as the haustoria, show high electron dense cellular particles without any recognisable organelles, probably related to the effect of the toxic compound pterostilbene, which is synthesised in this grape cultivar. In M. rotundifolia <b>leaf</b> <b>necrosis</b> are much more scarce and smaller than in other cultivars, but pathogen and plant cells are both strongly affected, with concomitant expulsion of cytoplasmic materials through the stomata after P. viticola penetration.
