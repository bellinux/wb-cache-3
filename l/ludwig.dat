5000|$|<b>Ludwig's</b> angina {{should not}} be {{confused}} with angina pectoris, which is also otherwise commonly known as [...] "angina". The word [...] "angina" [...] comes from the Greek word ἀγχόνη ankʰónē, meaning [...] "strangling". In this case, <b>Ludwig's</b> angina refers to the feeling of strangling, not the feeling of chest pain, though there may be chest pain in <b>Ludwig's</b> angina if the infection spreads into the retrosternal space.|$|R

40|$|<b>Ludwig's</b> angina is a {{life-threatening}} cellulitis {{that involves the}} submandibular and sublingual spaces. It often occurs after an infection of {{the roots of the}} teeth. However, modern dental care and use of antibiotics for oral infections have made <b>Ludwig's</b> angina rare. We present here a cancer patient exhibiting the sequential features of bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of the jaw on bone scan complicating with <b>Ludwig's</b> angina. This report highlights the need for medical practitioners to be alert to these rare combinations in the compromised patient after bisphosphonate therapy.
