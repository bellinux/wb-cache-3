In 1950 the army sent Baxter (then Captain) to work for a year with Professor Sir Hersch Lauterpacht, the Whewell Professor of International Law at Cambridge University and, at the time, the world's leading international legal scholar.

[...] At the time of his resignation from the U.S. Army, Baxter was awarded the Legion of Merit and held the position of Chief of the International <b>Law</b> <b>Branch</b> – Office of the Judge Advocate General. Baxter was later appointed as a full professor of law and first holder of the Manley O Hudson Chair of International Law. Baxter's research at Harvard concerned the legal regime of inter oceanic canals with an emphasis on the Panama and Suez. He became the leading scholar in the area of law concerning international waterways and his advice was actively sought by the Pentagon and State Department during the Suez crisis. [...] Baxter's research was published as the monograph, The Law of International Waterways [...] and is considered the definitive work on the subject and a classic in its field. [...] In the latter part of his twenty years of teaching at Harvard Law School, he devoted {{a great deal of time}} and effort to the writing, together with Professor Louis B. Sohn, of a study on State responsibility for the U.N. International Law Commission.|$|E
