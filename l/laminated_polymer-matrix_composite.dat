40|$|Th. e {{objective}} ofthis manuscript is {{to describe}} experimental work that quantifies the damage and self-healing behavior of fiber-reinforced, <b>polymer-matrix,</b> <b>laminated</b> <b>composites.</b> The effects of damage and healing on stiffness and strength are described. While previous research looks at healing of macro-cracks, this work studies the healing of micro-cracks. Therefore, this work quantifies the effect of damage and self-healing {{within the context of}} continuum damage mechanics. This work also evaluates the effects ofincorporating a self-healing system on the overall material properties ofa laminate before andafterthe self-healing system is self-activated. Self-healing ofglass fiber-reinforced epoxy laminates is accomplished by a dispersion ofmicro-capsules containing a healing agent and an encapsulated catalyst. The healing agent, dicyclopentadiene is encapsulated andthen dispersed in the epoxyresin during handlayup. The catalyst capable ofinitiating a ROMP reaction with the DCPD is also encapsulated and dispersed in similar fashion. Continuum Damage Mechanics is usedpurposely to avoid having to investigate the micro-structural features ofthe complex composite/healing system but rather to assess the composite's performance using macroscopic features, i. e., reduced stiffness, which directly relates to structural performance an it is much easierto quantify experimentally...|$|R

The {{fabrication}} processing, {{dielectric properties}} and thermal properties of <b>polymer-matrix</b> <b>composites</b> containing AlN particles (10 µm) for electronic substrates and microelectronic packaging applications were investigated.

The microstructures of the <b>polymer-matrix</b> <b>composites</b> are observed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

40|$|<b>Polymer-matrix</b> <b>composites</b> (PMCs), {{material}} systems made {{of two or}} more phases, {{are increasingly}} being utilized in aerospace applications due to their high strength-to-weight ratios and corrosion resistance. The present reasearch investigates two different types of PMCs: particle-reinforced and fiber-reinforced. To adequately describe some surprising properties that are observed in <b>polymer-matrix</b> <b>composites</b> reinforced with nanoscale filler particles, a three-phase theoretical model is proposed that is suitable for describing the effective permittivity of <b>polymer-matrix</b> <b>composites</b> containing spherical nanoparticles. The model accounts for the presence of an interphase region, which takes on a dominant role in influencing properties of nano-filled composites due to the large surface-area-to-volume ratio of nanoscale fillers. Regarding fiber-reinforced PMCs, spectroscopic techniques have been utilized to determine indicators of composite aging due to thermo-oxidation which are generally undetected by other non-destructive methods, such as ultrasonic testing. Two aerospace composite systems, bismaleimide/glass-fiber and epoxy/carbon-fiber, are thermo-oxidatively aged at a variety of temperatures. Both aged systems are analyzed via photoacoustic spectroscopy, an abosorbance-based IR spectroscopy technique, while the bismaleimide/glass-fiber system is also analyzed dielectrically. Spectroscopic properties are correlated with interlaminar shear strengths to determine the viability of particular degradation indicators and it is observed that changes in permittivity and dissipation factor of bismaleimide/glass-fiber both correlate well with reduction in interlaminar shear strength due to thermo-oxidative aging. The degradation is characterized through kinetic modeling, and the rates and activation energies of the degradation are extracted. Finally, dielectric properties as a function of temperature are measured for bismaleimide resin, and a major relaxation is modeled and characterized...|$|R
