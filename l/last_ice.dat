5|$|Until 17,800 {{years before}} present, the region {{southeast}} of Hudson {{was covered by}} the glaciers of the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age. Their retreat left a series of lakes that caught tephra deposited by volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age only {{large mammals}} such as mammoths, bison and woolly {{rhinoceros}} remained. Roughly 11,000years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests {{they came from}} {{the northern part of the}} Iberian Peninsula. The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Cleveland tri-state area, Youngstown {{is in the}} Mahoning Valley on the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau. At {{the end of the}} <b>last</b> <b>Ice</b> Age, {{the glaciers}} left behind a uniform plain with valleys eroded by the Mahoning River {{crossing}} the plain. Lakes created by glaciers that dammed small streams were eventually drained, leaving behind fertile terrain.|$|E

5|$|Mauna Kea in {{tropical}} Hawaii. There {{is evidence of}} past subglacial eruptive activity on the volcano {{in the form of}} a subglacial deposit on its summit. The eruptions originated about 10,000 years ago, during the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age, when the summit of Mauna Kea was covered in ice.|$|E
5|$|The Red River Valley is {{the result}} of an ancient glacier carving its way south during the <b>last</b> <b>Ice</b> Age. Once the glacier receded, it formed a glacial lake called Lake Agassiz. The valley is formed from the ancient lake bed. The ancient beaches can still be seen as rolling hills west of the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Fairbanks, the second-largest city in Alaska, {{can be traced}} to the {{founding}} of a trading post by E.T. Barnette on the south bank of the Chena River on August 26, 1901. The area had seen human occupation since at least the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age, but a permanent settlement was not established at the site of Fairbanks until the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|The {{world ranking}} {{is based on}} the final {{positions}} of the <b>last</b> four <b>Ice</b> Hockey World Championships and <b>last</b> Olympic <b>ice</b> hockey tournament. Points are assigned according to a team's final placement in the World Championship or the Olympic tournament. The world champion receives 1200 points and then a 20-point interval is used between teams. However, a 40-point interval is used between gold and silver, silver and bronze, fourth and fifth, and eighth and ninth. This is used as a bonus for the teams who reach the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the final and for winning the gold medal.|$|R
5|$|The mountainous {{terrain of}} the Chetco River {{watershed}} was created approximately 130million {{years ago when}} the microcontinent collided with the much larger North American continent. The process uplifted the complex and exotic terranes of the microcontinent to form the Klamath Mountains. Many glaciers carved U-shaped valleys and cirques during the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age, and several alpine lakes still exist today.|$|E
5|$|The size of glaciers on Mount Rainier has fluctuated {{significantly}} in the past. For example, during the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age, from about 25,000 to about 15,000years ago, glaciers covered most of the area now {{within the boundaries of}} Mount Rainier National Park and extended to the perimeter of the present Puget Sound Basin.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} {{rocks of}} which the mountain is made were formed in the caldera of an ancient volcano, {{many of them in}} violently explosive eruptions, about 450 million years ago during the Ordovician period. During the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age these rocks were carved by glaciers to create the landforms seen today.|$|E

50|$|Tribute to the Gods is {{the seventh}} studio album by heavy metal band Iced Earth. It is notable as the <b>last</b> <b>Iced</b> Earth album {{featuring}} Larry Tarnowski on lead guitar, {{and the last}} featuring singer Matt Barlow on vocals until his 2007 return, and their last album with Century Media. This record technically was first released the year before in the box set Dark Genesis, but was re-released as a standalone disc in 2002. It was then re-released {{as part of the}} set Enter the Realm of the Gods along with the band's 1989 demo Enter the Realm in 2008 with new cover artwork.|$|R

5|$|A relict species nearly exterminated by the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age, box {{huckleberry}} is self-sterile, and {{is found}} in isolated colonies which reproduce clonally by extending roots. One colony in Pennsylvania was once estimated to {{be as many as}} 13,000 years old; more recent estimates have an upper bound of about 8,000 years, which would make it the oldest woody plant east of the Rocky Mountains. Another colony in Pennsylvania, about 1,300 years old, has been protected by the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.|$|E
5|$|Although {{underlain}} by {{much older}} Triassic age formations that protrude to form what would {{once have been}} islands—such as Athelney, Brent Knoll, Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor, which is composed of Blue Lias, the lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000years, {{following the end of}} the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age. As the sea level changed following the Pliocene era, vegetation was laid down which was later converted into peat. The peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E

40|$|In 2006 the British Geological Survey {{initiated}} a new cross-thematic project specifically {{to examine the}} palaeo-glaciology of the <b>last</b> British <b>Ice</b> Sheet. The project aims to formalise the research carried out by BGS staff since 2001. In collaboration with colleagues at Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberystwyth and Exeter universities and UK Research Centres (BAS, SAMS) we have started to constrain the spatial and temporal limits {{as well as the}} flow dynamics of the <b>last</b> British <b>Ice</b> Sheet using geological field evidence, radiometric dating and numerical simulations. This poster summarises some of the key findings so far, including: •	Identification of palaeo-ice streams within the British Ice Sheet, both onshore and on the continental shelf. These include: The Minch, Moray Firth, Forth-Strathmore, Tweed and Witch Ground palaeo-ice streams. •	Reconstruction of lateral and vertical ice-mass extents, in key locations such as the Central Grampian Highlands, the North West Highlands, the Cairngorms and the Southern Uplands. •	Dating of ice-sheet margins using cosmogenic 10 Be in the Cairngorms, Strathspey, Wester Ross, Shetland and the Central Grampian Highlands. •	Simulations of the dynamical evolution of the <b>last</b> British <b>Ice</b> Sheet with high-resolution numerical modelling. •	Recognition of complexity within the Lateglacial landscape record. ...|$|R

5|$|Because of {{morphological}} similarities, the Sumatran rhinoceros {{is believed}} to be closely related to the extinct woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis). The woolly rhinoceros, so named for the coat of hair it shares with the Sumatran rhinoceros, first appeared in China; by the Upper Pleistocene, it ranged across the Eurasian continent from Korea to Spain. The woolly rhinoceros survived the <b>last</b> <b>Ice</b> Age, but, like the woolly mammoth, most or all became extinct around 10,000 years ago. Although some morphological studies questioned the relationship, recent molecular analysis has supported the two species as sister taxa.|$|E
5|$|Because the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age {{removed the}} top {{sediment}} {{layer of the}} soil, the Kola Peninsula is on the surface extremely rich in various ores and minerals, including apatites and nephelines; copper, nickel, and iron ores; mica; kyanites; ceramic materials, as well as rare-earth elements and non-ferrous ores. Deposits of construction materials such as granite, quartzite, and limestone are also abundant. Diatomaceous earth deposits are common near lakes and are used to produce insulation.|$|E

50|$|Dark Genesis is a five-disc box set by American {{heavy metal}} band Iced Earth, {{released}} on November 27, 2001. It contains remastered versions {{of their first}} three studio albums (Iced Earth, Night of the Stormrider and Burnt Offerings), their rare demo Enter the Realm, and a newly recorded tribute CD, Tribute to the Gods, which contains covers of many songs that have influenced Iced Earth. The Tribute to the Gods CD was the <b>last</b> <b>Iced</b> Earth release to feature lead guitarist Larry Tarnowski, and the last to feature Matt Barlow until his 2007 return. As well, that same disc marked bassist James MacDonough's first Iced Earth disc since 1999, {{as he had been}} absent during the recording of Horror Show.|$|R
