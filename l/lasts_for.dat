5|$|Aspirin is a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} the fever and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever. The therapy often <b>lasts</b> <b>for</b> one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. Naproxen {{has been shown to}} be as effective as aspirin and less toxic, but due to the limited clinical experience, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} at 10 to 14 months. A {{seasonal}} breeder, {{the time when}} mating occurs varies geographically. Mating may peak in the rainy season (August to September). When a female enters oestrus (which <b>lasts</b> <b>for</b> four to six days), it seeks the company of males. During courtship, the male will pursue the female, test her urine to check if she is in oestrus and lick her rump and flanks. Gestation <b>lasts</b> <b>for</b> six to seven months, following which a single calf is born; births peak from November to December in southern Africa. The newborn is kept in concealment for nearly a month; the mother pays regular visits to her calf to suckle it for nearly half an hour. Males may guard their offspring from predators and keep away other males. Weaning takes place at four to five months. The oribi lives for 8 to 12 years in the wild, and for 12 to 14 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Bufotenin, {{one of the}} {{chemicals}} excreted by the cane toad, is classified as a class-1 drug under Australian law, alongside heroin and cannabis. The effects of bufotenin {{are thought to be}} similar to those of mild poisoning; the stimulation, which includes mild hallucinations, <b>lasts</b> <b>for</b> less than an hour. As the cane toad excretes bufotenin in small amounts, and other toxins in relatively large quantities, toad licking could result in serious illness or death.|$|E

40|$|A 55  year old {{man with}} {{intermittent}} Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome had an episode of atrial fibrillation (AF) that <b>lasted</b> <b>for</b> 117  days. After interruption of the AF a Δwave appeared that <b>lasted</b> <b>for</b> two days and then disappeared. Exercise stress and isoprenaline infusion could not reproduce the Δwave, but after another episode of AF which <b>lasted</b> <b>for</b> seven days a persistent Δwave appeared that <b>lasted</b> <b>for</b> six hours. In an electrophysiological study performed on a day without a Δwave, neither antegrade nor retrograde conduction via an accessory pathway was seen, but after atrial burst pacing (at 250  ms cycle length) for 10  minutes, a Δwave appeared <b>lasting</b> <b>for</b> 16  seconds. Atrial electrical remodelling—that is, the shortening of the atrial effective refractory period caused by AF, is a possible mechanism of {{the appearance of the}} Δwave.    Keywords: Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome; atrial fibrillation; electrical remodellin...|$|R
5|$|By definition, {{there is}} no serious {{underlying}} medical condition, and most importantly, the ulcers do not represent oral cancer nor are they infectious. However, aphthae are capable of causing significant discomfort. There is a spectrum of severity, with symptoms ranging from a minor nuisance to disabling. Due to pain during eating, weight loss may develop {{as a result of}} not eating in severe cases of aphthous stomatitis. Usually, the condition <b>lasts</b> <b>for</b> several years before spontaneously disappearing in later life.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases <b>lasts</b> <b>for</b> several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E
5|$|Eumenorrhea denotes normal, regular {{menstruation}} that <b>lasts</b> <b>for</b> a {{few days}} (usually 3 to 5 days, but anywhere from 2 to 7 days is considered normal). The average blood loss during menstruation is 35 milliliters with 10–80 ml considered normal. Women who experience Menorrhagia {{are more susceptible to}} iron deficiency than the average person. An enzyme called plasmin inhibits clotting in the menstrual fluid.|$|E

Each estrus bout <b>lasts</b> <b>for</b> one or two days.|$|E
5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. When {{one of the}} males approaches the female, he uses his upper jaw to grab her dorsum. The male will then roll the female over by grabbing one of her pectoral fins, which are located {{on either side of}} her body. Once he is on her ventral side, the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them venter to venter, with both undersides together. The mating process <b>lasts</b> <b>for</b> 30–90 seconds.|$|E
