5|$|The federal {{government}} has dedicated nearly 2,000 times more acreage to oil and gas leases than to solar development. In 2010 the Bureau of <b>Land</b> <b>Management</b> approved nine large-scale solar projects, with a total generating capacity of 3,682 megawatts, representing approximately 40,000 acres. In contrast, in 2010, the Bureau of <b>Land</b> <b>Management</b> processed more than 5,200 applications gas and oil leases, and issued 1,308 leases, {{for a total of}} 3.2 million acres. Currently, 38.2 million acres of onshore public lands and an additional 36.9 million acres of offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico are under lease for oil and gas development, exploration and production.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970s, the Bureau of <b>Land</b> <b>Management</b> {{identified}} damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas. Approximately 20,000 willow trees were planted along streams, small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams, and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing. Next, the agency sought to reform land-use plans to change grazing practices, which became a complex and controversial project.|$|E

5|$|A leat {{from this}} stretch was created at {{around the time}} of the {{construction}} of the canal to provide water for the Twyford Mead water meadows. Farming of the water meadows continued until around 1930, after the closure of the navigation itself. It was a labour-intensive method of <b>land</b> <b>management,</b> but the controlled flooding of the meadows, with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops of hay per year, as well as grazing for sheep and cattle. Demonstrations of the techniques used to flood the meadows are still carried out occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Although {{machinery}} {{has replaced}} horses {{in many parts}} of the world, an estimated 100million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas. This number includes around 27million working animals in Africa alone. Some <b>land</b> <b>management</b> practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with horses. In agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as horses. Logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.|$|E
