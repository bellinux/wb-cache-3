40|$|Regulatory {{authorities}} in the banking and savings and loan industries have mandated that institutions establish loan <b>loss</b> <b>allowances</b> for regulatory accounting principles (RAP) that may be in excess of amounts recorded by the institution in preparing its financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The issue is whether an institution can record different loan <b>loss</b> <b>allowances</b> under the two methods and, if so, under what circumstances. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that an institution could record different loan <b>loss</b> <b>allowances</b> under RAP and GAAP as the amounts computed by preparers of financial statements and regulators may differ due to the subjectivity involved in estimating the amount of loss {{or the use of}} arbitrary factors by regulators. However, auditors should be particularly skeptical in the case of GAAP/RAP differences and must justify them based on the particular facts and circumstances.

However, it appears that the quality of assets does not explain banks' provisioning policy.

A pilot regulation period has started in 2011 and full application will be effective by the end of 2018. Partial adjustment models and variance decomposition are used for the analyses. In the analysis of the quarterly released financial statements of Vietnamese commercial banks in the period from 2008 /Q 1 to 2015 /Q 4, the empirical evidence showed that throughout the period, lending to non-bank and high liquidity assets contributed to the adjustment in both long run and short run with a negative association.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the security market reaction {{of financial institutions}} to the issuance of the FASB 2 ̆ 7 s 1986 Exposure Draft (ED) which proposed the Statement of Cash Flows. Through the coordinated efforts of Robert Morris Associates, an association of credit lending officers, financial institutions advocated a need for and lobbied the FASB for the Statement of Cash Flows. ^ Drawing upon the Efficient Market Hypothesis and the Information Content Hypothesis, {{it was hypothesized that}} there was a positive security market reaction by financial institutions to the issuance of the ED. Drawing upon theories of coalition and regulation, financial institutions were hypothesized to have lobbied for the change in accounting regulation in order to reduce credit risk associated with lending. Credit risk effects were hypothesized to be positively associated with the security market reaction of financial institutions to the issuance of the ED. Proxy variables for credit risk effects were measured by selected firm characteristics. Normal domestic credit risk was measured by a ratio of the loan <b>loss</b> <b>allowance</b> to total assets. Geographic credit risk related to lending in the Dallas or Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank Districts was represented by a one/zero dummy variable. Foreign credit risk associated with lending internationally to lesser developed countries was represented by a one/zero dummy variable. ^ Using time series analysis, there was a positive, but insignificant security market reaction by financial institutions to the issuance of the ED. Using cross sectional analysis, there was support for concluding that normal domestic credit risk and geographic credit risk were positively associated with the security market reaction to the ED. The hypothesis representing foreign credit risk was not supported by the analysis. The statement of cash flows, useful in evaluating credit risk, is more valuable to financial institutions other than the largest banks involved in lending to lesser developed countries. ^ The results support the theories of coalition ad regulation. Financial institutions organized a coalition and lobbied the FASB to obtain a change in accounting regulation that benefited the financial services industry. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} behavioural {{responses of}} companies´ declared profits {{to changes in}} profit tax rates. Using microsimulation modelling based on the UK corporate tax system, it argues that the cyclical volatility of firms´ gross profits and off-setting deductions are potentially important but distinct determinants {{of the size of}} these behavioural responses. This arises both because deductions claimed are typically a relatively large fraction of declared gross profits and because of the endogenous relationships between various deductions and those profits. The endogeneity arises mainly from asymmetries in the tax treatment of losses, which generates an asymmetric cycle in the claiming of <b>losses</b> and capital <b>allowances</b> as profit off-sets. Microsimulation modelling shows that these aspects can be sizeable compared with recent estimates of firms´ profit-shifting responses found in the empirical literature. corporate tax, behavioural responses, profit-shifting, economic cycle...|$|R

The failures of small banks (those with less than $ 1 billion in assets) in these states were largely driven by credit losses on commercial real estate (CRE) loans, particularly loans secured by real estate to finance land development and construction. Many of the failed banks had often pursued aggressive growth strategies using nontraditional, riskier funding sources and exhibited weak underwriting and credit administration practices. The Department of the Treasury and the Financial Stability Forum's Working Group on Loss Provisioning observed that earlier recognition of credit losses could have potentially lessened {{the impact of the}} crisis. The accounting model used for estimating credit losses is based on historical loss rates, which were low in the prefinancial crisis years. In part due to these accounting rules, loan loss allowances were not adequate to absorb the wave of credit losses that occurred once the financial crisis began. Banks had to recognize these losses through a sudden series of increases (provisions) to the loan <b>loss</b> <b>allowance</b> that reduced earnings and regulatory capital. In December 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a proposal for public comment for a loan loss provisioning model that is more forward looking and would incorporate a broader range of credit information.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Ten states concentrated in the western, midwestern, and southeastern United Statesall areas where the housing market had experienced strong growth in the prior decadeexperienced 10 or more commercial bank or thrift (bank) failures between 2008 and 2011. The failures of the smaller banks (those with less than $ 1 billion in assets) in these states were largely driven by credit losses on commercial real estate (CRE) loans. The failed banks also had often pursued aggressive growth strategies using nontraditional, riskier funding sources and exhibited weak underwriting and credit administration practices. The rapid growth of CRE portfolios led to high concentrations that increased the banks exposure to the sustained real estate and economic downturn that began in 2007. GAOs econometric model revealed that CRE concentrations {{and the use of}} brokered deposits, a funding source carrying higher risk than core deposits, were associated with an increased likelihood of failure for banks across all states during the period. Several state regulatory and community banking association officials told GAO that in some cases, the losses failed banks incurred on their CRE loans were caused by declines {{in the value of the}} underlying collateral of impaired, collateral-dependent loans. However, data are not publicly available that indicate the extent to which loan losses were driven by such declines in collateral values. Fair value accounting also has been cited as a potential contributor to bank failures, but between 2007 and 2011 fair value accounting losses in general did not appear to be a major contributor, as over two-thirds of small failed banks assets were not subject to fair value accounting. The Department of the Treasury and the Financial Stability Forums Working Group on Loss Provisioning have observed that the current accounting model for estimating credit losses is based on historical loss rates, which were low in the prefinancial crisis years.
