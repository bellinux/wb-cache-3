6000|$|Is that picturesque? A {{lady has}} told me that in a chapel of the Mosque in Boston there is a picture or image of Mrs. Eddy, and that before it burns a never-extinguished light. Is that picturesque? How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will be before the Christian Scientist will be worshipping that picture or image and praying to it? How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will be before it is claimed that Mrs. Eddy is a Redeemer, a Christ, and Christ's equal? Already her army of disciples speak of her reverently as [...] "Our Mother." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{our streets}} are clean, {{for the time}} being, and {{when we look at}} them we think we have made a clean sweep in our manners and morals. But how <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will be before Tammany will be in the saddle again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and how <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{could find}} happiness, in calling {{beautiful}} gardens into existence, one after another?" ...|$|R
2500|$|When asked [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a {{child should}} be allowed to cry after being punished? Is there a limit?" [...] Dobson responded: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have?" [...] the Capataz de Cargadores {{repeated}} cautiously. [...] "Well, that is wonderful. And how <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{are going}} to keep it up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Calc--! Yes, I have. I {{tell you}} that it is three times as easy--six times as easy: more fool the woman! You can make a woman happy for a week by a word or a kiss. How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> takes to order a week's dinners? I suppose you {{consider}} a kiss a weakness?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{tragedy of}} love is not death or separation. How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would have been before one or other of them ceased to care? Oh, it is dreadfully bitter {{to look at a}} woman whom you have loved with all your heart and soul, so that you felt you could not bear to let her out of your sight, and realise that you would not mind if you never saw her again. The tragedy {{of love is}} indifference." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will excuse my emotion, gentlemen, and I am {{sure you}} can {{understand}} my feelings. I am thankful indeed for the news you have brought me. I have never ceased {{for a moment to}} hope that my boy would be restored to me; but the knowledge that it is so, and that God has spared him to me, is for the moment overpowering. And where was the ship met with, Major Barlow, and where was she bound for? How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is likely to be before Ralph comes home?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I {{can stand}} it on four doughnuts? Here are you fellers livin' high, an' I'm goin' 'round jest {{about ready to}} die." ...|$|R
6000|$|She also debated [...] "Mr. Newsome and Madame de Vionnet may, {{as we were}} saying, leave town. How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{can bear}} it without them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{a curious}} position," [...] Ned said, as he went on deck next morning. [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{we are likely to}} be kept here, Peters?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you have}} no idea what an amount of {{interest}} and enthusiasm the affair created. You all know, of course, that the Indian cable, which Robin and I had a hand in laying, is now connected with the lines that pass between Suez, Alexandria, Malta, Gibraltar, Lisbon, and England; and the company assembled at Mr Pender's house witnessed the sending of the first messages direct from London to Bombay; and how <b>long,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>it</b> took to send the first message, and receive a reply?--only five minutes!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, how <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will {{be before}} we cross Laing's Nek? Of course {{we ought to}} be there by to-morrow morning. It is only a hundred and fifty miles, and at fifteen miles an hour, which is about their usual rate of travelling, we should cross the {{frontier}} at two o'clock, for it was about four when we started. But there is no saying. My father thought we ought to take four days' provisions with us; I think we could hold out for that time." ...|$|E
6000|$|Are {{these things}} picturesque? The Viennese lady {{told me that}} in a chapel of the Mosque {{there was a picture}} or image of Mrs. Eddy, and that before it burns a never-extinguished light. Is that picturesque? How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will be before the Christian Scientist will be worshipping that image and praying to it? How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will be before it is claimed that Mrs. Eddy is a Redeemer, a Christ, or Christ's equal? Already her army of disciples speak of her reverently as 'Our Mother.' How long will it be before they place her {{on the steps of the}} Throne beside the Virgin--and later a step higher? First, Mary the Virgin and Mary the Matron; later, with a change of Precedence, Mary the Matron and Mary the Virgin. Let the artist get ready with his canvas and his brushes; the new Renaissance is on its way, and there will be money in altar-canvases--a {{thousand}} times as much as the Popes and their Church ever spent on the Old Masters; for their riches were as poverty as compared with what is going to pour into the treasure-chest of the Christian-Scientist Papacy by-and-by, let us not doubt it. We will examine the financial outlook presently and see what it promises. A favourite subject of the new Old Master will be the first verse of the twelfth chapter of Revelation--a verse which Mrs. Eddy says (in her Annex to the Scriptures) has 'one distinctive feature which has special reference to the present age'--and to her, as is rather pointedly indicated: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And how <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> my voyage {{is likely}} to last?" [...] demanded Wilder, {{dropping}} his voice so low as to reach no ears but those of the publican.|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> our {{twenty dollars}} will last at that rate? Besides, {{the only way}} to begin is to begin at the beginning. We didn't plan {{sleeping}} in hotels." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{we might}} even now do business. I am most anxious to be of use to <b>you.</b> How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> doctor, that this gentleman will in all {{probability}} live?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After the {{troubles}} and anxiety {{we have of}} late gone through, Monsieur Glover, we feel the comfort of being {{under the protection of}} the British flag, and shall enjoy it all the more now that we know that {{you are not going to}} sea again in that pretty little vessel, for if you fell in with another large corsair you might not be so fortunate as you were last time. As you have said, if an unlucky shot had struck one of your spars, you would have been at her mercy, and we know what that mercy would mean. I intend to stay here for a short time, till madame and the girls get quite accustomed to their new home, before sailing for Port-au-Prince; but whether I am at home or away you know how welcome you will be here whenever you happen to be in port. How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is likely to be before you are off?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 47. The stopping, on any terms, is {{difficult}} enough to understand; nor less so, the original gaining of the pace. We {{always think of}} flight as if the main difficulty of it were only in keeping up in the air;--but the buoyancy is conceivable enough, the far more wonderful matter is the getting along. You find it hard work to row yourself at anything like speed, though your impulse-stroke is given in a heavy element, and your return-stroke in a light one. But both in birds and fishes, the impelling stroke and its return {{are in the same}} element; and if, for the bird, that medium yields easily to its impulses, it secedes as easily from the blow that gives it. And if you think what an effort you make to leap six feet, with the earth for a fulcrum, the dart either of a trout or a swallow, with no fulcrum but the water and air they penetrate, will seem to you, I think, greatly marvelous. Yet of the mode in which it is accomplished you will as yet find no undisputed account in any book on natural history, and scarcely, as far as I know, definite notice even of the rate of flight. What do you suppose it is? We are apt to think of the migration of a swallow, as we should ourselves of a serious journey. How <b>long,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>it</b> would take him, if he flew uninterruptedly, to get from here to Africa? ...|$|E
60|$|Here, then, {{you have}} pictorially represented, {{the system of}} manly education, {{supposed}} in old Florence to be that necessarily instituted in great earthly kingdoms or republics, animated by the Spirit shed down upon the world at Pentecost. How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will take you, or ought to take, to see such a picture? We were {{to get to work}} this morning, as early as might be: you have probably allowed half an hour for Santa Maria Novella; half an hour for San Lorenzo; an hour for the museum of sculpture at the Bargello; an hour for shopping; and then it will be lunch time, and you mustn't be late, because you are to leave by the afternoon train, and must positively be in Rome to-morrow morning. Well, of your half-hour for Santa Maria Novella,--after Ghirlandajo's choir, Orcagna's transept, and Cimabue's Madonna, and the painted windows, have been seen properly, there will remain, suppose, at the utmost, {{a quarter of an hour}} for the Spanish Chapel. That will give you two minutes and a half for each side, two for the ceiling, and three for studying Murray's explanations or mine. Two minutes and a half you have got, then--(and I observed, during my five weeks' work in the chapel, that English visitors seldom gave so much)--to read this scheme given you by Simon Memmi of human spiritual education. In order to understand the purport of it, in any the smallest degree, you must summon to your memory, in the course of these two minutes and a half, what you happen to be acquainted with of the doctrines and characters of Pythagoras, Zoroaster, Aristotle, Dionysius the Areopagite, St. Augustine, and the emperor Justinian, and having further observed the expressions and actions attributed by the painter to these personages, judge how far he has succeeded in reaching a true and worthy ideal of them, and how large or how subordinate a part in his general scheme of human learning he supposes their peculiar doctrines properly to occupy. For myself, being, to my much sorrow, now an old person; and, to my much pride, an old-fashioned one, I have not found my powers either of reading or memory in the least increased by any of Mr. Stephenson's or Mr. Wheatstone's inventions; and though indeed I came here from Lucca in three hours instead of a day, which it used to take, I do not think myself able, on that account, to see any picture in Florence in less time than it took formerly, or even obliged to hurry myself in any investigations connected with it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cyneec? How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I {{would live}} if I {{was not a}} cyneec? I should drown myself to-morrow. Perhaps there are good people, but, you see, I don't know them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he {{can remain}} in this shed without being discovered?" [...] Saul asked stupidly, {{and then it}} was that Pierre {{explained}} his plan, so far as he had formed it.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's possible," [...] Bernard agreed, with a {{touch of}} ironical humor. [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> must give Evelyn, {{in order to avoid the}} jar she might get if you prematurely {{revealed}} your hopes?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Prominent {{speakers}} included Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Harry Reid, Sen. Al Franken, Elizabeth Warren, Gov. Brian Schweitzer, Ed Schultz, Sen. Jeff Merkley, Sen. Ben Cardin, Sen.

Jerrold Nadler, Van Jones, Rich Trumka, Tim Wise, Lizz Winstead, Majora Carter, Markos Moulitsas, Tarryl Clark, Bill Halter, Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins, Gerald McEntee and Eliseo Medina. During his speech, Sen. Franken (D-MN) {{argued against}} media consolidation and for net neutrality laws. He said, in part, [...] "If we don't protect Net Neutrality now, how <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will take before Comcast-NBC Universal, or Verizon-CBS Viacom or AT&T-ABC-DirecTV or BP-Haliburton-Walmart-Fox-Domino's-Pizza start favoring its content over everyone else's?" ...|$|E
40|$|A {{manuscript}} by Harold Bradley that {{discusses the}} types of musical education and focuses on the practice of having children take music lessons. For example, Bradley states "You do not want your child to be a musician. This is something over which you will have little control. Fundamentally, all children love music and love to perform. If you are an exceptional parent {{you may be able}} to withstand the blandishments of the teacher who tells you how talented your child is. But what about the child? How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> takes before he is convinced? Not very long. Everything is in the music teacher's favor. If you are a sensible parent you are not going to convince your child at home that she is a genius, neither will the child learn this at school from her teachers there. To the child it is only the music teacher who is able to recognize her talent. ...|$|E
6000|$|Then she laughed, and {{her husband}} laughed, {{doubling}} himself into a knot of merriment. [...] "Oh, but that's rich!" [...] said he. [...] "You've been asleep exactly {{an hour and a}} quarter," [...] he added. [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you'd slept--two days?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Cavor did {{not seem}} to hear me. He was peering under his hand at the stars, that still, in spite of the intense sunlight, were abundantly visible in the sky. [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we've have been here?" [...] he asked at last.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. TORRANCE. 'There is {{something}} I {{want to ask}} <b>you,</b> John--How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the war is likely to last?' Her John resumes his paper.

How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it'll be before he gets tired of a scrubby room in a scrubby hotel? Besides, he hasn't any money. He must come back." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "This is sad, indeed," [...] {{the lawyer}} said, sympathetically. [...] "The Squire--everyone about here calls him the Squire, you know, {{though there are}} men with broader acres than his in the neighborhood--will be terribly missed. Dear, dear, {{it will make a}} sad gap indeed: how <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he is likely to last?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, the pavilions {{architect}} {{was present}} {{and gave a}} speech in which when asked [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the structure would stand?" [...] Answered [...] "Well, my body at almost 85 years of age, it's stood along time, but I've had maintenance; and if I had so little maintenance as that structure I would have been gone long ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|A deadly change {{come over}} the countenance of Theodora, and the surgeon looked alarmed. He would have given her some restorative, but she refused it. [...] "No, kind friend," [...] she said; [...] "it is finished. I have just {{received}} a wound more fatal than the shot in the field this morning. The French are at Rome. Tell me, kind friend, how <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I may live?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good fellow, Strong--ain't he, Miss Bell?" [...] Sir Francis {{would say}} to her.

6000|$|... "Well, God bless you, lad, {{and bring}} you back safely! You may make as light of it as you will, {{but it is a}} {{dangerous}} expedition. However, I am glad you have undertaken it, come what may, for it has given you the opportunity of showing you are not afraid of danger when it takes any other form than that of firearms. There are plenty of men who would stand up bravely enough in a fight, who would not like to undertake this task of going out alone in the dark into the middle of these bloodthirsty scoundrels.
