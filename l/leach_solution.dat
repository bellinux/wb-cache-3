40|$|In this study, the {{interfacial}} crud {{produced during}} {{the extraction of}} vanadium and chromium by primary amine N(1923) was investigated from the <b>leaching</b> <b>solution</b> containing heavy metals. Effect of pH values of the <b>leaching</b> <b>solution</b> on {{the percentage of the}} crud produced and the emulsion type of the crud were studied. X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) have been employed for the physiochemical characterizations of the crud. Our results indicate that the percentage of the crud produced is greatly affected by the pH value of the real <b>leaching</b> <b>solution,</b> and the crud is more stable in the acidic solution. The crud is an oil-in-water emulsion with many fine solid particles in the water phase. The particles, which are from the real <b>leaching</b> <b>solution,</b> have been proved to be the main cause for the crud formation. Particles in the cruds are normally composed {{of a large number of}} the crystals of Na(2) SO(4), a few SiO(2) and oxides or hydroxids of Fe and Al. However. component proportions of the solids are dependent on the pH values. Possible mechanism of the crud formation is put forward. The solids present in the real <b>leaching</b> <b>solution</b> exert a stabilizing effect on the emulsion, based on which Na(2) SO(4) crystallizes at the interface of the emulsion. Furthermore, the Na(2) SO(4) crystals strengthen the stability of the emulsion, and thereafter the interfacial crud forms. Three effective methods to prevent the crud formation are proposed, i. e. clearing the real <b>leaching</b> <b>solution</b> by membrane filtration, increasing of the amount of the modifier. and applying of hexane as the diluent.

30|$|One of {{the methods}} to {{overcome}} the bacterial loss was to apply <b>leaching</b> <b>solution</b> with low ionic strength in the column tests (Gannon et al. 1991; Redman et al. 2004). They found that the decrease in the ionic strength of the pore fluid—thereby eliminating the secondary energy minimum—resulted in {{the release of the}} majority of previously deposited bacteria. However, their findings were limited to the investigation on the existence of the secondary energy minimum since they applied the <b>leaching</b> <b>solution</b> with low ionic strength after a complete bacterial breakthrough—a rather long elution after breakthrough—in the column tests. More detailed information on the separation of the primary energy minimum from the secondary energy minimum and the reversible portion of bacterial attachment requires a careful design of breakthrough experiment for a given bacterium and porous medium. One of the solutions to this problem would be to apply <b>leaching</b> <b>solutions</b> with various ionic strengths immediately after a bacterial pulse since the input of lower ionic strength will generate various situations in the interaction energy between bacteria and particle surfaces as <b>leaching</b> <b>solutions</b> propagate down the column system. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the reversibility of bacterial attachment during the transport through aquifer material and the effect of the chemical perturbation on the bacterial detachment. We conducted bacterial transport experiments by applying <b>leaching</b> <b>solutions</b> of various ionic strengths after bacterial pulse.

In {{the second set of}} experiment, the ionic strengths of <b>leaching</b> <b>solutions</b> immediately after bacterial pulse were lowered to tenfold and 100 -fold diluted system (2 and 20  mM MSM) to focus on the influence of physicochemical factor. Results have shown that bacterial retention occurred in the sand column due to the physical deposition and physicochemical attachment. The physicochemical attachment was attributed to the high ionic strength (200  mM MSM) of <b>leaching</b> <b>solution</b> and the formation of primary energy minimum. Replacing the 200  mM <b>leaching</b> <b>solution</b> with the lower ionic strengths after pulse resulted in the increased tailing of breakthrough curve due to the detachment from the attached bacteria. The detachment could be well explained by DLVO theory, which showed the formation of energy barrier and disappearance of the secondary minimum as the ionic strength gradually decreased.
