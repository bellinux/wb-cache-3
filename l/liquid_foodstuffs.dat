Technical developments and parameters influencing the extraction yield and selectivity are examined and discussed. Experimental results for the analysis of pesticides, veterinary drugs, persistent en v iron mental chemicals, naturally occurring toxicants, and surfactants in food are reviewed...|$|E
40|$|Isothermal {{tanks are}} widely used for {{transport}} of perishable <b>liquid</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> like milk, wine, juice etc., {{and according to the}} international ATP Agreement, they have to be tested periodically in officially recognized national ATP Test Stations to ensure that they meet the specifications. The testing of a multicompartment isothermal tank presents special difficulties in comparison to the testing of a refrigerated truck {{because of the number of}} compartments that have to be measured. The instrumentation needed for testing a specimen in these cases is complex and that is why only a few ATP Test Stations can conduct such tests. In this study, a heat transfer numerical simulation is described of a multi-compartment isothermal tank for the transport of perishable <b>liquid</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> tested at a new environmental ATP chamber recently constructed at the Zografou Campus of the National Technical University in Athens. The tests were conducted according to the regulations specified in the United Nations ATP Agreement. A transient finite difference model is developed for a typical specimen multi-compartment isothermal tank tested inside an ATP Testing Chamber. To adjust the cooling or heating system, a PI controller is used. The simulation results are compared to experimental measurements under real conditions and show good agreement. The study describes also a method for testing multi-compartment isothermal tanks according to the ATP specifications using only the measuring equipment normally existing in every ATP laboratory. With the proposed method, the testing of a three compartment liquid foodstuff tank is possible using only one heating capacity adjuster, e. g. one PI controller and one thyristor instead of the three independent PI controllers and three thyristors normally needed in order to adjust the required heating capacity inside each compartment.

40|$|The {{application}} of pulsed electric fields (PEF) {{as a process}} {{in the treatment of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>foodstuff,</b> although not fully understood, appears to have significant potential. This treatment technology represents a promising nonthermal technique that may supplement or replace conventional pasteurisation methods for some applications. The advantages of such an electrotechnology include the potential retention of fresh-food characteristics and organoleptic qualities such as flavour, aroma, and texture. Pulsed electric field inactivation of microorganisms is generally thought to be caused by irreversible structural changes in the cellular plasma membrane resulting in swelling or shrinkage and finally lysis of the cell. Previous evidence of this external membrane damage has not established what damage, if any, is caused by PEF treatment on the internal structure of the cell. This investigation using laser scanning transmission microscopy of the spoilage yeast Zygosaccharomyces bailii after PEF treatment shows evidence of internal damage to the nuclear membrane. It has been reported that electric field rise times in the 1 - 100 ns range are required for intracellular electroporation. The laser images indicate that this range must be more extensive than previously reported since with the rise time of ∼ 160 ns extensive nuclear membrane damage has been caused to the yeast cells. Such damage, in combination with plasma membrane damage, could contribute to the inactivation of Z. bailii by PEF...|$|R
40|$|The {{preservation}} of the cold chain {{is one of the}} most important requirements in order to maintain quality in the transport of perishable foodstuffs. A significant part of the aggregate of the universally transported perishable foodstuffs and more specific <b>liquid</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> like milk, wine, juice, etc. is carried out by multi-compartment isothermal tanks. According to the international ATP Agreement these special equipment used for international transport of perishable foodstuffs have to be tested periodically in officially recognized national ATP Test Stations to ensure that they meet the specifications. Because of the number of the compartments that have to be measured the testing of a multi-compartment isothermal tank presents special difficulties in comparison to the testing of a refrigerated truck. The instrumentation needed for testing a specimen in these cases is complex and that is why only few ATP Test Stations conduct such tests. In this study a heat transfer numerical simulation is described by a four compartment isothermal tank for the transport of perishable <b>liquid</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> tested inside an ATP chamber. The simulated tests were conducted according to the regulations specified in the United Nations ATP Agreement. A transient finite difference model is developed for a typical four compartment isothermal tank tested inside an ATP Testing Chamber with dimensions and specifications like that of the ATP chamber of the Zografou Campus of the National Technical University in Athens. For the control of the cooling/heating system a proportional-integral controller is employed. The study describes a method for measuring the k-coefficient of a four compartment isothermal tank according to ATP specifications using ordinary laboratory equipments. With the suggested method, the testing of a four compartment tank is possible using only one P-I controller and one thyristor instead of the normally needed four independent P-I controllers and four thyristors in order to adjust the heat power needed inside each compartment of the four compartment isothermal tank.

40|$|The {{development}} of mechatronic systems {{involves the use}} of multiple disciplines, from mechanical engineering to electronics engineering and computer science. Traditionally, every discipline was developed independently and then integrated to generate the final system. However, high-quality designs cannot be achieved without simultaneously considering all the engineering disciplines. This integrated approach carries an intrinsic complexity into system design process and numerous researches are on-going in order to find out optimal methods. This article illustrates a methodology based on Model-Based System Engineering to support the integrated {{development of}} complex mechatronic devices. The main contribution is the introduction of a design methodology based on the W model and the identification of SysML as the tool to support the whole process. This method will also address the problem of “devices interchangeability”, that means the possibility to develop the functionality of a system with different operation principles, at a very early stage of the development process (i. e. during the conceptual development). To achieve this goal, the methodology treats the problem of linking the conceptual with executable models to enable the validation by simulation. Main advantages of this methodology are in providing, to the mechatronic systems designers, a fixed schedule which does not limit their intuition and reduces complexity through a hierarchical approach. The process has been tested through the rationalization of the choices that have brought to the current solution of the filling system of an automatic filling machine for <b>liquid</b> <b>foodstuff...</b>|$|R

Originally, the early Maya used gourds cut into useful shapes to create vessels to carry <b>liquids</b> and <b>foodstuffs.</b> These portable and durable gourds made excellent containers. The first ceramics closely resembled gourds and many were decorated with rocker stamps and simple slips. During the Late Preclassic period, many of the ceramics took on appendages of tetrapod mammiform supports. These supports were four legs underneath the pot holding it up. Tetrapods are relatively rare in the Maya Lowlands- even in the Peten where they were first described. Characteristic cream-on-red stripes colored these unique vessels.|$|R

In aseptic processing {{the product and}} the package are sterilized separately and then combined and sealed in a sterile atmosphere, in contrast to canning, where product and package are first combined and then sterilized. When filled with ultra-heat treated (UHT) <b>foodstuffs</b> (<b>liquids</b> like milk and juice or processed food like vegetables and preserved fruits), the aseptic packages can be preserved without being chilled for up to one year, {{with the result that}} distribution and storage costs, as well as environmental impact, is greatly reduced and product shelf life expanded.|$|R
40|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{necessary for the}} contents of medication capsules to be mixed with certain foods and drinks because children are not always able to swallow the capsules. The compatibility and short-term stability (6 h) of melatonin capsules mixed {{in a variety of}} <b>liquids</b> and <b>foodstuffs</b> (water, orange juice, semi-skimmed milk, strawberry yogurt, and strawberry jam) were analyzed for degradation. Extraction of melatonin from these common administration vehicles and an analytical assay for the drug and its potential degradation products were developed and validated. The results showed good recovery of melatonin from low- and high-strength capsules for all administration vehicles (between 89 % minimum and 111 % maximum). The drug was found to be stable in the common liquids and foods tested for up to 6 hours at room temperature (no degradation peak); hence it is unlikely to compromise the results of the Use of Melatonin in Children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Impaired Sleep trial. © 2008 Mac Keith Press. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to extend}} the field of {{application}} of the pressure rise test technique, from freeze drying of pharmaceutical or biological products in vials to freeze drying of <b>liquids</b> or <b>foodstuff</b> in trays. The proposed method, {{which is based on}} DPE+ algorithm, has been adapted to monitor the drying of liquids in trays and of individually quick frozen products. Examples of results obtained in a small-scale plant wherein such a method was used for monitoring the freeze drying of spinach samples and solutions of sucrose and lactose are presented. Since in bulk freeze drying the radiant energy coming from the upper shelf might be not negligible, the effectiveness of this method has been tested in the presence of different radiating contributions. A more sophisticated algorithm to interpret the pressure rise curve, which uses a mathematical model accounting for both conduction heat transfer from the bottom and radiant energy coming from the upper shelf and including heat accumulation into the dried layer, is proposed and experimentally teste...|$|R
40|$|When PGSE NMR {{is applied}} to water in microheterogeneous {{materials}} such as <b>liquid</b> crystals, <b>foodstuffs,</b> porous rocks, and biological tissues, the signal attenuation is often multi-exponential, indicating the presence of pores having a range of sizes or anisotropic domains having a spread of orientations. Here we modify the standard PGSE experiment by introducing low-amplitude harmonically modulated gradients, which effectively make the q-vector perform magic-angle spinning (MAS) about an axis fixed in the laboratory frame. With this new technique, denoted q-MAS PGSE, the signal attenuation depends on the isotropic average of the local diffusion tensor. The capability of q-MAS PGSE to distinguish between pore size and domain orientation dispersion is demonstrated by experiments on a yeast cell suspension and a polydomain anisotropic liquid crystal. In the latter case, the broad distribution of apparent diffusivities observed with PGSE is narrowed to its isotropic average with q-MAS PGSE {{in a manner that}} is analogous to the narrowing of chemical shift anisotropy powder patterns using magic-angle sample spinning in solid-state NMR. The new q-MAS PGSE technique could be useful for resolving size/orientation ambiguities in the interpretation of PGSE data from, e. g., water confined within the axons of human brain tissue...|$|R
40|$|Aims The {{application}} of broad-spectrum intense light pulses is an innovative nonthermal {{technology for the}} decontamination of packaging materials, <b>liquids</b> or <b>foodstuffs.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} the fundamental investigation of the cellular impact of a pulsed light treatment on Listeria innocua and Escherichia coli. Methods and Results Flow cytometry in combination with different fluorescent stains, conventional plate count technique and a viability assay were applied to investigate the effects of a pulsed light treatment on the physiological properties of L. innocua and E. coli. The results showed that loss of cultivability occurred at considerably lower fluences than the shutdown of cellular functions such as the depolarization of cell membranes, the loss of metabolic, esterase and pump activities or the occurrence of membrane damage. Therefore, a considerable proportion of cells appeared to have entered the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after the pulsed light treatment. A high percentage of L. innocua was able to maintain certain cellular vitality functions after storage overnight, whereas a further decrease in vitality was observed in case of E. coli. The loss of culturability was on the other hand directly accompanied by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damages, which were assessed by the ROS-sensitive probe DCFH-DA and RAPD-PCR, respectively. Conclusions A significant discrepancy between conventional plate counts and different viability staining parameters was observed, which shows that a pulsed light treatment does not cause an immediate shutdown of vitality functions even when the number of colony-forming units already decreased for more than 6 log 10 sample− 1. Oxidative stress with concomitant damage to the DNA molecule showed to be directly responsible for the loss of cultivability due to pulsed light rather than a direct rupture of cell membranes or inactivation of intracellular enzymes. Significance and Impact of the Study The presented results suggest an UV light-induced photochemical rather than a photothermal or photophysical inactivation of bacterial cells by pulsed light under the applied experimental conditions. Flow cytometry in combination with different viability stains proved to be a suitable technique to gain deeper insight into the cellular response of bacteria to inactivation processes like a pulsed light treatment...|$|R
