The inspiration for the new system was simply making it possible for the newly ascendant Willie Hoppe to be meaningfully challenged – his near-unassailability was hurting billiard tournament revenues, because the outcome was considered foreordained by many potential ticket-buyers. The system was expected to <b>level</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field in other ways, especially making it easier for skilled amateurs to enter the professional ranks.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{power and}} fossil fuels are subsidized by many governments, and wind power {{and other forms}} of {{renewable}} energy are also often subsidized. For example, a 2009 study by the Environmental Law Institute assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies over the 2002–2008 period. The study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totalled $29 billion. In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74billion for energy subsidies to support R for nuclear power ($50 billion) and fossil fuels ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003. During this same time frame, renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of US$26billion. It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help to <b>level</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field and support growing energy sectors, namely solar power, wind power, and biofuels. History shows that no energy sector was developed without subsidies.|$|E

5|$|Rommel was {{an ambitious}} {{man who took}} {{advantage}} of his proximity to Hitler and willingly accepted the propaganda campaigns designed for him by Goebbels. He sought to <b>level</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field for non-nobles, and also supported militarism and a strong German Empire, while treating people only according to their merits. He did not display hatred to people of noble descent, and in fact was {{a throwback to the}} medieval knight in his personal traits, appearing well-versed in the ancient customs of chivalry, which helped to attract admiration from the British who saw in him a romantic archetype. Rommel classed himself as a traditionalist regarding military ethics and a modernist regarding warfare techniques. Certain authors remark that he also sought military glory and personal recognition, most of all from Hitler on whom, according to Watson, Rommel projected his idea of the German people's will.|$|E
5|$|The main {{narrative}} for Over the Edge {{continued the}} events that unfolded at , WWF's previous pay-per-view event, held on April 25, 1999. There, The Undertaker abducted Stephanie McMahon, the daughter of chairman Vince McMahon. The Undertaker's price for Stephanie's return was control over the wrestling organization. His plans were thwarted, however, by the WWF Champion, Steve Austin, who rescued Stephanie and denied The Undertaker his ransom. This plot development set up a feud between the two wrestlers, which would be settled in a standard singles match for the Championship at Over the Edge, in which both Vince and his son Shane, who had aligned himself with The Undertaker, would serve as the guest referee. Originally Shane had named himself the sole referee of the match, but WWF commissioner Shawn Michaels made Vince the co-referee in order to <b>level</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field. WWF further built up the rivalry between The Undertaker and Austin by having them attack each other on WWF programming, before their showdown. On May 3, 1999, The Undertaker threw Austin off the stage, and two weeks later, the WWF Champion handcuffed his title's challenger to a crucifix, which was raised above the ring.|$|E
5|$|While some, like Spencer, used analogy {{from natural}} {{selection}} as an argument against government {{intervention in the}} economy to benefit the poor, others, including Alfred Russel Wallace, argued that action was needed to correct social and economic inequities to <b>level</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field before natural selection could improve humanity further. Some political commentaries, including Walter Bagehot's Physics and Politics (1872), attempted to extend the idea of natural selection to competition between nations and between human races. Such ideas were incorporated into what was already an ongoing effort by some working in anthropology to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of Caucasians over non white races and justify European imperialism. Historians write that most such political and economic commentators had only a superficial understanding of Darwin's scientific theory, and were as strongly influenced by other concepts about social progress and evolution, such as the Lamarckian ideas of Spencer and Haeckel, as they were by Darwin's work. Darwin objected to his ideas being used to justify military aggression and unethical business practices as he believed morality was part of fitness in humans, and he opposed polygenism, the idea that human races were fundamentally distinct and did not share a recent common ancestry.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} various regulatory policies on the decision to dope by athletes.

Under plausible assumptions, these schemes {{are more likely to}} control doping for risk averse athletes compared to risk neutral ones, poorer athletes compared to their wealthier counterparts, and athletes with high earning potentials relative to those with lower potential.

25|$|Soon {{after that}} first event, the Highland Games began being held at the Basin Reserve. The games were {{organised}} by the Wellingtonian Caledonian Society, of which their headquarters, The Caledonian Hotel, still stands towards {{the south of the}} Basin Reserve. The society offered up prize money which brought many competitors to the region. Due to their success, the society petitioned to have new grandstands built at the western end of the Basin Reserve. They would measure 44ft by 20ft and would cost approximately £250–£300. The stands would also hold food stalls and ground keepers. However, for the following years, even up until reportedly 1872, the Basin Reserve grounds were still extremely swampy, with small pools of swamp water and various weeds and shrubs sprouting over the fields.

500|$|Game {{director}} and composer Junichi Masuda stated that {{to keep the}} games fresh, he looks at every previous element {{to decide what to}} adapt to the new game, stating [...] "people may not like what they like in the past, trend wise". He explained the new battle styles, stating that while triple battles take more strategy, rotation battles take more luck to win. Masuda stated that their goal when making the games was to make it fun for new players, but they also wanted to get players who have not played the series in a while to come back. He said that it was hard to find that balance to satisfy both kinds of players. For the new players, there is good explanation in how to play, while for old players, they incorporated the C-Gear, which makes the ability to trade and battle easier. When asked about the decision to introduce over 150 new species of Pokémon, Masuda stated that they did this so old players {{would not be able to}} know what is a good Pokémon to use, and it would <b>level</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> ground for new players.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player campaign, players have access to online multiplayer through the game's main menu. The multiplayer features two modes: a competitive mode where players face each other in various stages, and a co-op mode where a team of players face bosses from the single-player campaign. For the competitive match, the player can choose from multiple allied and enemy characters, and all boons granted by equipment or experience levels are removed to <b>level</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field. Teams of up to six players can be formed for team matches. Players gain or lose points when they defeat or are defeated by an opponent, and defeated enemies respawn in the battlefield. When all opponents have been defeated, all players are awarded with items and equipment that can carry over into the single-player campaign: those who performed the best receive higher-quality equipment and [...] "titles" [...] ti distinguish them from other players. The co-op battles allow players to carry over their equipment and character levels from single-player, with the available characters being restricted to Zael's mercenary group.

40|$|<b>Levelling</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> {{field is}} an {{important}} policy instrument to guarantee an equitable competition among heterogeneous individuals. However, the incentive effects of those policies are usually not explicitly addressed in empirical studies. In this article the performance in amateur golf tournaments is analysed to gain insights into the incentive effects of those types of policies. The empirical analysis {{takes advantage of the}} fact that tournaments in amateur golf are of two distinctive types that apply different scoring rules: while one scoring rule is based on gross scores, i. e. the total number of strokes of a player, the second scoring rule is based on net scores where the total number of strokes is normalized with respect to the respective player's handicap. Performance comparisons of players who participated in both types of tournaments suggest that <b>levelling</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field, as in tournaments based on net score, has positive and significant performance effects. © 2012 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
