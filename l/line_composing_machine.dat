40|$|Traditional systems {{engineering}} methods {{for the performance}} evaluation of manufacturing systems assume that machine reliability parameters (Mean Time to Failure and Mean Time to Repair) are precisely known. However, in practical situations, these parameters are either estimated from real life data or based on experts’ knowledge. In both cases, {{they are subject to}} uncertainty. This paper proposes for the first time an approach for the performance evaluation of unreliable manufacturing systems that considers uncertain machine parameter estimates. The proposed method is based on the combined use of Bayesian estimation, probability density function discretization and existing decomposition-based techniques for analyzing manufacturing <b>lines</b> <b>composed</b> of unreliable <b>machines</b> and capacitated buffers. Numerical results show that neglecting uncertainty in the input parameter estimates generates consistent errors in the output performance measure estimates, thus making the consequent system design and operation decisions sub-performing.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the impact of}} failure models {{on the performance of}} transfer <b>lines</b> <b>composed</b> of N <b>machines</b> separated by N - 1 buffers. The two most used failure models, operation-dependent failures (ODF) and time-dependent failures (TDF), are considered. A machine subject to TDF can fail even it is not working on a part. A machine subject to ODF cannot fail if it is not working on a part. A transfer line considered in this paper contains both machines subject to TDF and machines subject to ODF. Up times, repair times and processing times are continuous random variables of general distribution. We prove that modelling a machine subject to ODF of a transfer line as a machine subject to TDF, as usually done in the literature, leads to under-estimation of the throughput rate if the time between failures of the related machine is exponentially distributed while all other times are general random variables. We then propose a timed Petri net approach for performance evaluation and simulation of transfer lines with both machines subject to TDF and machines subject to ODF. Numerical results show that this result holds under more general conditions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Transfer {{lines are}} more and more {{dedicated}} to producing a variety of similar products allowing some flexibility to this important class of manufacturing systems. For many decades, an important work has been done to evaluate the performance and specifically the capacity of transfer lines. However, most of these works are so far limited to the mono-product and homogeneous transfer lines. This paper analyses the performance of transfer <b>lines</b> <b>composed</b> of several <b>machines</b> with a serial configuration and dedicated to producing a variety of products in a batch production environment. The products are manufactured according to the real stochastic and dynamic demand characterized by random product arrivals and random lot sizing. The considered transfer lines have no intermediate buffers between adjacent machines. Machines have different deterministic processing times and are subject to random operationdependent failures. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose analytical models to assess the steady-state availability and the overall throughput of such lines. A general simulation model was developed and statistical tests were carried out to prove the robustness and the exactness of the proposed analytical models.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Most of the {{research}} concerning production systems is so far limited to {{the assessment of the}} steady-state throughput despite the impact of the parameter variability on the overall performance of such systems. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to assess the variance of the throughput of homogeneous transfer lines subject to operation-dependant failures. The transfer lines subject of study are composed of a series of manufacturing machines with no intermediate buffers where failure and repair times are exponentially distributed. Based on Markov reward processes, the proposed analytical model determines the limiting variance of the sojourn time in the operational state. A numerical procedure has also been developed to assess the variance of the throughput for transfer <b>lines</b> <b>composed</b> of several <b>machines</b> with different reliability and maintainability characteristics. Numerical examples show that, although the steady-state throughput decreases monotonically, the throughout variance of transfer lines increases and then decreases as the number of manufacturing machines constituting it increases. Compared to past works considering time-dependent failure mode, the results show that in general transfer lines subject to operation-dependant failure mode are superior to those subject to time-dependant failure mode not only in term of the steady-state throughput but also when considering their respective throughput variability.

40|$|AbstractThe {{automotive}} industry {{is characterized by}} the continuous and frequent adoption of cutting edge technologies in manufacturing. The introduction of new technology often entails a system level investigation to determine whether it meets expected production requirements. Many system design alternatives are usually considered at this stage, and a fast performance evaluation tool is desired to quickly obtain the optimum system configuration. In this paper, we introduce an analytical tool that was developed for this specific purpose. The investigated manufacturing system is a multi-product, automated, assembly production <b>line</b> <b>composed</b> of unreliable <b>machines</b> decoupled by finite buffers. Each product is an assembly of two components that are produced in sub-assembly lines before being assembled at an assembly machine. The performance of this system needs to be evaluated for different configurations that arise mainly due to the integration of a remote laser welding technology. This new technology promises, among other advantages, a much faster assembly than existing technologies. This makes it feasible to share assembly among many products with different possible production policies. The processing machines including the assembly machine are liable to fail randomly in operation thereby necessitating an evaluation method capable of accounting for stochastic behavior. To solve this problem, we develop a decomposition-based approximate analytical method. We use the continuous material flow approximation, which allows to model machines having deterministic but inhomogeneous processing times as in the investigated real system. We also account for multiple machine failure modes and introduce new techniques to incorporate the assembly of multiple products with different policies of switching between products. Comparison with simulation results shows the good accuracy of the model in estimating system throughput and work-in-progress. The model has been successfully utilized to evaluate the performance of an automotive door assembly manufacturing system and the main results of this case study are reported...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of a system can start {{with the creation of}} a specification. Following this viewpoint, we claim that often a specification can be constructed from the combination of specifications which can be seen as composition. Event-B is a formal method that allows modelling and refinement of systems. The combination, reuse and validation of component specifications are not currently supported in Event-B. We extend the Event-B formalism using shared event composition as an option for developing (distributed) systems. Refinement is used in the {{development of}} specifications using <b>composed</b> <b>machines</b> and we prove that properties and proof obligations of specifications can be reused to ensure valid composed specifications. The main contributions of this work are the Event-B extension to support shared event composition and refinement including the proof obligations for a <b>composed</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R

30|$|There {{are several}} studies related to reliability, {{availability}} and maintainability of manufacturing systems. Cockerill (1990) has presented a Reliability, Availability and Maintainability—RAM {{analysis of a}} turbine-generator system. Tsarouhas (2012) reviewed the reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM) analysis in the food industries and aims to identify the critical points of the production systems that should be improved by the operational performance and the maintenance effectiveness. Collas (1994) has given a simple methodology for assessing the complex system availability and reliability. Koulamas (1992) and Savsar (2000) developed Markov models to {{study the effects of}} tool failures on system performance measures for a flexible manufacturing cell with a single machine served by a robot for part loading/unloading and a pallet for part transfers to estimate the reliability and maintenance. Hassett et al. (1995) have combined time varying failure rates and Markov chain analysis to obtain hybrid reliability and availability analysis. Rezg et al. (2004) proposed an integrated method for preventive maintenance and inventory control of a production <b>line,</b> <b>composed</b> of n <b>machines</b> subject to failures without intermediate buffers. Marseguerra et al. (2004) calculated optimal reliability and availability of uncertain systems via multi-objective genetic algorithms. Born and Criscimagna (1995) developed a methodology to evaluate the need of reliability, maintainability and diagnostics for translation processes. Sharma et al. (2008) proposed a methodological and structured framework that makes use of both qualitative and quantitative techniques aiming at risk and reliability analysis of the system. Tsarouhas (2013) studied the reliability and maintainability analysis, which are the fundamental issues for the operation management of a dialysis system. Markeset and Kumar (2001) have discussed the application of reliability, maintainability and risk analysis methods to minimize life cycle cost of the system. Tatry et al.

40|$|UML-B is a UML-like {{graphical}} {{front end}} for Event-B that provides support for object- oriented modelling concepts. In particular, UML-B supports class diagrams and state machines, concepts {{that are not}} explicitly supported in plain Event-B. In Event-B, refinement is used to relate system models at different abstraction levels. The same abstraction-refinement concepts can also be applied in UML-B. This work introduces the notions of refined classes, refined state machines and extended classtypes to en- able refinement of classes and state machines in UML-B. This work makes explicit the structures of class and state machine refinement in UML-B. This work also introduces seven refinement techniques which are, adding new attributes and associations, adding new classes, elaborating state, elaborating transition, moving a class event (or a state machine transition), adding new attributes and associations, and adding new classtypes. In Event-B, decomposition is used to decompose a system into components. The same decomposition concepts can be applied in UML-B. This work introduces the techniques of flattening state machines and state grouping to facilitate a decomposition of a UML-B machine. This work also introduces the notion of <b>composed</b> <b>machine</b> which <b>composes</b> the component <b>machines.</b> The <b>composed</b> <b>machine</b> refines a machine which is being decomposed. The <b>composed</b> <b>machine</b> is used to ensure {{the composition of the}} component machines is a valid refinement. Together with the <b>composed</b> UML-B <b>machine,</b> the notions of included <b>machine,</b> <b>composed</b> event and constituent event are introduced. The UML-B drawing tool and Event-B translator are extended to support the new refinement and decomposition concepts. A case study of an auto teller machine (ATM) is presented to validate the extensions of UML-B with regards to the above notions. The ATM case study also demonstrates the above techniques introduced in refinement and decomposition. In addition, this work provides guidelines for performing refinement and decomposition in UML-B and presents a number of generic invariants that may be used when refining a middleware. The middleware is a component via which a requesting component such as an ATM and a responding component such as bank interact in a distributed system.
