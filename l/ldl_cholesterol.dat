5|$|<b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol</b> {{normally}} circulates in {{the body}} for 2.5 days, and subsequently the apolipoprotein B portion of <b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol</b> binds to the LDL receptor on the liver cells, triggering its uptake and digestion. This process results in the removal of LDL from the circulatory system. Synthesis of cholesterol by the liver is suppressed in the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. In FH, LDL receptor function is reduced or absent, and LDL circulates for an average duration of 4.5 days, resulting in significantly increased level of <b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol</b> in the blood with normal levels of other lipoproteins. In mutations of ApoB, reduced binding of LDL particles to the receptor causes the increased level of <b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol.</b> It is not known how the mutation causes LDL receptor dysfunction in mutations of PCSK9 and ARH.|$|E
5|$|Alirocumab and evolocumab, both {{monoclonal}} antibodies against PCSK9, {{are specifically}} indicated as adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy {{for the treatment}} of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, who require additional lowering of <b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol.</b>|$|E
5|$|More {{controversial}} is {{the addition}} of ezetimibe, which inhibits cholesterol absorption in the gut. While it reduces <b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol,</b> {{it does not appear}} to improve a marker of atherosclerosis called the intima-media thickness. Whether this means that ezetimibe is of no overall benefit in FH is unknown.|$|E

5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colestipol), nicotinic acid preparations or fibrates. Control of {{other risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend {{that the decision to}} treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk. Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce <b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels.|$|E
25|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} measuring the effects of guideline changes on <b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol</b> reporting and control for diabetes visits in the US from 1995 to 2004. It was found that although <b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol</b> reporting and control for diabetes and coronary heart disease visits improved continuously between 1995 and 2004, neither the 1998 ADA guidelines nor the 2001 ATP III guidelines increased <b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol</b> control for diabetes relative to coronary heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Increasing soluble fiber {{consumption}} {{has been}} shown to reduce levels of <b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol,</b> with each additional gram of soluble fiber reducing LDL by an average of 2.2mg/dL (0.057mmol/L). Increasing consumption of whole grains also reduces <b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol,</b> with whole grain oats being particularly effective. Inclusion of 2 g per day of phytosterols and phytostanols and 10 to 20 g per day of soluble fiber decreases dietary cholesterol absorption. A diet high in fructose can raise <b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels in the blood.|$|E
50|$|A 1995 review {{concluded}} that soy protein is correlated with significant decreases in serum <b>cholesterol,</b> <b>LDL</b> (bad <b>cholesterol)</b> and triglycerides. However, HDL (good cholesterol) {{did not increase}} by a significant amount. Soy phytoestrogens (isoflavones: genistein and daidzein) adsorbed onto the soy protein were suggested as the agent reducing serum cholesterol levels.|$|R

25|$|Few {{studies have}} {{directly}} {{examined the effects}} of eating strawberries on human health. However, limited research indicates that strawberry consumption may be associated with a decreased cardiovascular disease risk and that phytochemicals present in strawberries have anti-inflammatory or anticancer properties in laboratory studies. Epidemiological studies have associated strawberry consumption with lower rates of hypertension, inflammation, cancer, and death from cardiovascular diseases. Certain studies have suggested that strawberry consumption may have beneficial effects in humans such as lowering blood <b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels, total cholesterol, reducing the oxidation of <b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol,</b> and decreasing the spike in blood sugar after high sugar meals and the spike in blood cholesterol seen after high-fat meals.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we attempt}} {{to find out whether}} chronic low dose 3 -Iodothyronamine (an {{endogenous}} metabolite of thyroid hormone) administration could modulate liver de novo cholesterol synthesis, the same as thyroid hormones. Eighteen male mice were divided randomly into treatment (n= 10) and control (n= 8) groups. The experimental procedure was applied for 7 days during which test group received T 1 AM whereas the control group received dimethyl sulfoxide and normal saline. The liver was analyzed for HMG-CoA reductase concentration and hepatic lipase activity whiles <b>cholesterol,</b> <b>LDL</b> and HDL concentrations were measured in the blood serum. There was non-significant decrease in HMG-CoA reductase concentration (224 ± 21. 2 versus 187 ± 32. 5) in test group compared to control. Interestingly <b>LDL</b> and <b>cholesterol</b> concentrations exhibited significant decrease in test group versus the control. There was non-significant decrease in hepatic lipase activity (771 ± 316 versus 645 ± 317) in test group versus the control.

50|$|Furthermore, sPLA2 remodels lipoproteins, notably low-density lipoproteins (LDL) {{and their}} receptors, which are {{responsible}} for removing cholesterol from the body. This remodeling can lead to increased deposition of <b>LDL</b> and <b>cholesterol</b> in the artery wall. In combination with chronic vascular inflammation, these deposits lead to atherosclerosis.|$|R
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{rosuvastatin}} on <b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol</b> are dose-related.

25|$|Rosuvastatin is {{approved}} in the United States {{for the treatment}} of high <b>LDL</b> <b>cholesterol</b> (dyslipidemia), total cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia), and/or triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia).

50|$|Also, the anionic (negatively charged) scorpion-like {{molecules}} inhibit cellular uptake of oxidized <b>LDL,</b> the ‘bad’ <b>cholesterol</b> in the body.

Contrary to most anti-atherosclerotic drugs, the anionic polymer only targets the bad <b>cholesterol</b> <b>LDL</b> particles and not the good cholesterol HDL. The delivery of these polymeric particles is now undergoing investigation with Professor Prabhas Moghe.|$|R
25|$|A {{blood sample}} after 12-hour fasting is {{taken by a}} doctor, or a home cholesterol-monitoring device is used to {{determine}} a lipoprotein profile.

It is recommended to test cholesterol at least every five years if a person has total cholesterol of 5.2mmol/L or more (200+mg/dL), or if a man over age 45 or a woman over age 50 has HDL (good) cholesterol less than 1mmol/L (40mg/dL), or there are other risk factors for heart disease and stroke. Other risk factors for heart disease include Diabetes, Hypertension (or use of anti-hypertensive medications), low HDL, family history of CAD and hypercholesterolemia, and cigarette smoking.|$|R
