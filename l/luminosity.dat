5|$|Astronomers {{characterize}} the morphology of a globular cluster {{by means of}} standard radii. These are the core radius (r'c), the half-light radius (r'h), and the tidal (or Jacobi) radius (r't). The overall <b>luminosity</b> of the cluster steadily decreases with distance from the core, and the core radius is the distance at which the apparent surface <b>luminosity</b> has dropped by half. A comparable quantity is the half-light radius, or {{the distance from the}} core within which half the total <b>luminosity</b> from the cluster is received. This is typically larger than the core radius.|$|E

5|$|Following the Great Eruption, Eta Carinae became self-obscured by the ejected material, {{resulting}} in dramatic reddening.

Eta Carinae is still much brighter at infrared wavelengths, despite the presumed hot stars behind the nebulosity. The recent visual brightening {{is considered to be}} largely caused by a decrease in the extinction, due to thinning dust or a reduction in mass loss, rather than an underlying change in the <b>luminosity.</b>|$|E

Our analysis shows that the integrated <b>luminosities</b> calculated from the SED are {{much larger than the}} bolometric <b>luminosities</b> estimated from monochromatic <b>luminosities.</b> Their departing behavior tightly correlates with radio <b>luminosities.</b> The relations between integrated and monochromatic <b>luminosities</b> are explored, which are regarded as empirical relations that might be more suitable to be applied to estimate integrated <b>luminosities</b> of FSRQs from their monochromatic <b>luminosities...</b>|$|R
40|$|Active galactic nuclei jets are {{detected}} via their radio and/or gamma-ray emissions {{while the}} accretion disks are detected by their optical and UV radiation. Observations {{of the radio}} and optical <b>luminosities</b> show {{a strong correlation between}} the two <b>luminosities.</b> However, part of this correlation is due to the redshift or distances of the sources that enter in calculating the <b>luminosities</b> from the observed fluxes and part of it could be due to the differences in the cosmological evolution of <b>luminosities.</b> Thus, the determination of the intrinsic correlations between the <b>luminosities</b> is not straightforward. It is affected by the observational selection effects and other factors that truncate the data, sometimes in a complex manner (e. g. Antonucci (2011) and Pavildou et al. (2010)). In this paper we describe methods that allow us to determine the evolution of the radio and optical <b>luminosities,</b> and determine the true intrinsic correlation between the two <b>luminosities.</b> We find a much weaker correlation than observed and sub-linear relations between the <b>luminosities.</b> This has a significant implication for jet and accretion disk physics.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} star formation (SF) and black hole accretion <b>luminosities,</b> using a sample of 492 type- 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z < 0. 22 which are detected in the far-infrared (FIR) surveys with AKARI and Herschel. We adopt FIR <b>luminosities</b> at 90 and 100 μm as SF <b>luminosities,</b> assuming the proposed linear proportionality of star formation rate with FIR <b>luminosities.</b> By estimating AGN <b>luminosities</b> from [O iii]λ 5007 and [O i]λ 6300 emission lines, we find a positive linear trend between FIR and AGN <b>luminosities</b> over a wide dynamical range. This result appears to be inconsistent with the recent reports that low-luminosity AGNs show essentially no correlation between FIR and X-ray <b>luminosities,</b> while the discrepancy is likely due to the Malmquist and sample selection biases. By analyzing the spectral energy distribution, we find that pure-AGN candidates, of which FIR radiation {{is thought to be}} AGN-dominated, show significantly low-SF activities. These AGNs hosted by low-SF galaxies are rare in our sample ～ 1 %. However, the low fraction of low-SF AGNs is possibly due to observational limitations since the recent FIR surveys are insufficient to examine the population of high-luminosity AGNs hosted by low-SF galaxies...|$|R
5|$|In high-mass main-sequence stars, the opacity is {{dominated}} by electron scattering, which is nearly constant with increasing temperature.

40|$|We {{present and}} analyze the {{possibility}} of using optical u-band <b>luminosities</b> to estimate star-formation rates (SFRs) of galaxies based on the data from the South Galactic Cap u band Sky Survey (SCUSS), which provides a deep u-band photometric survey covering about 5000 deg^ 2 of the South Galactic Cap. Based on two samples of normal star-forming galaxies selected by the BPT diagram, we explore the correlations between u-band, Hα, and IR <b>luminosities</b> by combing SCUSS data with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The attenuation-corrected u-band <b>luminosities</b> are tightly correlated with the Balmer decrement-corrected Hα <b>luminosities</b> with an rms scatter of ∼ 0. 17 dex. The IR-corrected u <b>luminosities</b> are derived based on the correlations between the attenuation of u-band <b>luminosities</b> and WISE 12 (or 22) μm <b>luminosities,</b> and then calibrated with the Balmer-corrected Hα <b>luminosities.</b> The systematic residuals of these calibrations are tested against the physical properties over the ranges covered by our sample objects. We find that the best-fitting nonlinear relations are better than the linear ones and recommended to be applied in the measurement of SFRs. The systematic deviations mainly come from the pollution of old stellar population and the effect of dust extinction; therefore, a more detailed analysis is needed in the future work.

For comparison, we have examined {{the relationship between the}} [O III] λ 5007, the 2 - 10 keV and the 14 - 195 keV <b>luminosities</b> for the same set of objects.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The <b>luminosities</b> and {{periods of}} {{obscured}} AGB {{stars in the}} LMC are discussed {{using a combination of}} ISO and ground-based infrared photometry. The bolometric <b>luminosities</b> of these stars fall close to an extrapolation of the period-luminosity relation derived for oxygen-rich Mira variables, with both oxygen- and carbon-rich stars falling close to the same relation. It has been known for many years that there are, in the Magellanic Clouds, significant numbers of large amplitude variables which have considerably higher <b>luminosities</b> than the period-luminosity relation would predict.

40|$|We study star {{formation}} rate (SFR) indicators for Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) 22 μ m selected, star-forming galaxies at 0. 01 < z < 0. 3 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Using extinction-corrected Hα <b>luminosities</b> and total infrared <b>luminosities</b> as reference SFR estimates, we calibrate WISE mid-infrared (MIR) related SFR indicators. Both 12 and 22 μ m monochromatic <b>luminosities</b> correlate {{well with the}} reference SFR estimates, but tend to underestimate SFRs of metal-poor galaxies (at lower than solar metallicity), consistent with previous studies. We mitigate this metallicity dependence using a linear combination of observed Hα and WISE MIR <b>luminosities</b> for SFR estimates. The combination provides robust SFR measurements as Kennicutt et al. (2009) applied to Spitzer data. However, {{we find that the}} coefficient a in L_Hα(obs) + a L_MIR increases with SFR, and show that a non-linear combination of observed Hα and MIR <b>luminosities</b> gives the best SFR estimates with small scatters and with little dependence on physical parameters.

5|$|As non-fusing helium ash accumulates in {{the core}} of a main-sequence star, the {{reduction}} in the abundance of hydrogen per unit mass results in a gradual lowering of the fusion rate within that mass. Since it is the outflow of fusion-supplied energy that supports the higher layers of the star, the core is compressed, producing higher temperatures and pressures. Both factors increase the rate of fusion thus moving the equilibrium towards a smaller, denser, hotter core producing more energy whose increased outflow pushes the higher layers further out. Thus there is a steady increase in the <b>luminosity</b> and radius of the star over time. For example, the <b>luminosity</b> of the early Sun was only about 70% of its current value. As a star ages this <b>luminosity</b> increase changes its position on the HR diagram. This effect results in a broadening of the main sequence band because stars are observed at random stages in their lifetime. That is, the main sequence band develops a thickness on the HR diagram; it is not simply a narrow line.|$|E
