50|$|Foam {{fractionation}} {{is closely}} related to the allied process of froth flotation in which hydrophobic particles attach to the surface of bubbles which rise to form a pneumatic (i.e. rising) foam. In this way, relatively hydrophobic particles can be separated from relatively hydrophilic particles. Froth flotation is typically used to separate coal particles from ash or particles of valuable minerals from gangue material. It was research into the froth phase of froth flotation conducted at the University of Newcastle, Australia, specifically into the prediction of liquid fraction and <b>liquid</b> <b>flux</b> in a pneumatic foam, that enabled a preliminary mechanistic description of foam fractionation. The synergies between foam fractionation and froth flotation have been explored in a 2009 special issue of the Asia Pacific Journal of Chemical Engineering.|$|E
50|$|The enamel {{workshops}} {{within the}} Byzantine Empire likely perfected their techniques through their connections with Classical Greek examples. The Greeks were already experts in enameling, soldering a filagree onto {{a flat base}} and later adding a paste of glass, or a <b>liquid</b> <b>flux,</b> to the base piece. The entire work was then fired, melting the glass paste into the frame to create the finished work. Occasionally, the ancient Greek craftsman would apply the glass flux to the base {{with the aid of}} a brush. The Romans, who were experienced in glass production already, would carve a recess into the base plate and then pour glass flux into each enclosure. The metal peeking through between the recessed glass would create the outline of the image. This technique is called champlevé, and is considerably easier than the cloisonné form of enameling practiced by the Greeks and Byzantines.|$|E
40|$|Steady-state finite-element {{models have}} been {{formulated}} to investigate the coupled fluid flow and thermal behavior of the top-surface flux layers in continuous casting of steel slabs. The 3 -D FIDAP ™ model includes the shear stresses imposed on the flux/steel interface by flow velocities calculated in the molten steel pool. It also includes different temperature-dependent powder properties for solidification and melting. Good agreement between the 3 -D model and experimental measurements was obtained. The shear forces, imposed by the steel surface motion towards the SEN, create a large recirculation zone in the <b>liquid</b> <b>flux</b> pool. Its depth increases with increasing casting speed, increasing <b>liquid</b> <b>flux</b> conductivity and decreasing flux viscosity. For typical conditions, this zone contains almost 4 kg of flux, which contributes to an average residence time of about 2 minutes. Additionally, because the shear forces produced by the narrowface consumption and the steel flow oppose each other, the flow in the <b>liquid</b> <b>flux</b> layer separates at a location centered 200 mm from the narrowface wall. This flow separation depletes the <b>liquid</b> <b>flux</b> pool at this location and may contribute to generically poor feeding of the mold-strand gap there. As a further consequence, a relatively cold spot develops at the wideface mold wall near the separation point. This non-uniformity in the temperature distribution may result in non-uniform heat removal, and possibly non-uniform initial shell growth in the meniscus region along the wideface off-corner region. In this way, potential steel quality problems {{may be linked to}} flow in the <b>liquid</b> <b>flux</b> pool...|$|E

Measurements of <b>liquid</b> <b>fluxes</b> are indispensable {{for the evaluation of}} the presence of condensate in pores during gas permeation. Differences between the gas flux (at both sides of the membrane the butane is in the gas phase) and the <b>liquid</b> butane <b>flux</b> (on the high pressure side of the membrane is liquid, on the opposite side is gas) were observed for the same pressure gradients across the membrane. The differences between these fluxes decrease with decreasing pressure gradients. For a pressure gradient higher than 2 bar the <b>flux</b> of the <b>liquid</b> butane is approximately two times higher, for a pressure gradient of 1. 3 bar the ratio of <b>liquid</b> and gas <b>fluxes</b> decreases to 1. 7. No difference between <b>liquid</b> and gas <b>fluxes</b> was registered for the lowest pressure gradient investigated (pressures on {{the two sides of the}} membrane: 2. 22 and 1. 91 bar).

40|$|This paper applies Drift Flux {{theory for}} the first time to explore the {{relationship}} between the liquid and solids flow through fluidized beds in the context of desliming of dense minerals. At low solids fluxes the process is not flux curve constrained. Here continuity considerations indicate the net <b>liquid</b> <b>flux</b> through the lower bed is upwards, ideal for the removal of slimes from the underflow product. Moreover, the liquid split to the underflow is also lower, further reducing the slimes content of the underflow. At higher solids fluxes the net <b>liquid</b> <b>flux</b> becomes downwards and eventually the system becomes flux curve constrained. Under these circumstances slimes entrainment to the underflow increases significantly. In order to operate at these higher solids fluxes, and achieve efficient desliming, Split Fluidization should be used. Here additional fluidization liquid is added at a higher elevation, producing a net <b>liquid</b> <b>flux</b> in the upwards direction through the zone above the Split Fluidization entrance level. Desliming experiments covering a range of solids fluxes were conducted to investigate the effects of increasing solids flux and Split Fluidization. This study shows that a system of parallel inclined channels, a key feature of the Reflux Classifier, permits the introduction of this additional liquid while preventing the ultra fine product from being entrained to the overflow reject stream, thus permitting the efficient removal of slimes. Experiments were conducted using an iron ore feed with particles smaller than 0. 50 mm in diameter.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} a uniform bubbly flow in a vertical column where a kinematic shock is induced. When the average flux is low, the kinematic shock speed is strongly dependant on the void fraction. As the <b>liquid</b> <b>flux</b> is increased, the strong coupling of shock speed and void fraction is reduced. The nuclear thermal-hydraulics code RELAP 5 /Mod 3. 3 {{will be used}} to assess the capability of a 1 -D code to numerically model kinematic shocks. Also tested is the code’s ability to accurately describe the propagation changes from a strong kinematic shock to an infinitesimal kinematic wave. As the shock strength approaches zero we are able compare the numerical results with a semi-analytical wave speed, which is derived from the kinematic wave theory. A modification to the drift flux correlations available in the code will be proposed for RELAP 5 and similar onedimensional codes where the bubble size is not predicted.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel non-intrusive optical technique for determination of <b>liquid</b> mass <b>flux</b> in a droplet laden airstream. The technique {{was developed for}} quantitative determination of engine water ingestion resulting from heavy rain or wheel spray. Independent measurements of the liquid water content (LWC) of the droplet laden aircraft and of the droplet velocities were made at the simulated nacelle inlet plane for the <b>liquid</b> mass <b>flux</b> determination. The <b>liquid</b> water content was measured by illuminating and photographing the droplets contained within a thin slice of the flow field {{by means of a}} sheet of light from a pulsed YAG laser. A fluorescent dye introduced in the water greatly improved the droplet image definition. The droplet velocities were determined from double exposed photographs of the moving droplet field. The technique was initially applied to a steady spray generated in a wind tunnel. It was found that although the spray was initially steady, the aerodynamic breakup process was inherently unsteady. This resulted in a wide variation of the instantaneous liquid water content of the droplet laden airstream. The standard deviation of ten separate LWC measurements was 31 percent of the average. However, the <b>liquid</b> mass <b>flux</b> calculated from the average LWC and droplet velocities came within 10 percent of the known water ingestion rate...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a probability density function (PDF) -based scheme to parameterize cloud fraction, average liquid water and <b>liquid</b> water <b>flux</b> in large-scale models, that is developed from and tested against large-eddy simulations and observational data. Because the tails of the PDFs are crucial for an appropriate parameterization of cloud properties, {{we use a}} double-Gaussian distribution that is able to represent the observed, skewed PDFs properly. Introducing two closure equations, the resulting parameterization relies on the first three moments of the subgrid variability of temperature and moisture as input parameters. The parameterization {{is found to be}} superior to a single-Gaussian approach in diagnosing the cloud fraction and average liquid water profiles. A priori testing also suggests improved accuracy compared to existing double-Gaussian closures. Furthermore, we find that the error of the new parameterization is smallest for a horizontal resolution of about 5 - 20 km and also depends on the appearance of mesoscale structures that are accompanied by higher rain rates. In combination with simple autoconversion schemes that only depend on the liquid water, the error introduced by the new parameterization is orders of magnitude smaller than the difference between various autoconversion schemes. For the <b>liquid</b> water <b>flux,</b> we {{introduce a}} parameterization that is depending on the skewness of the subgrid variability of temperature and moisture and that reproduces the profiles of the <b>liquid</b> water <b>flux</b> well. © 2013 Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|According {{to field}} {{measurements}} carried {{out during the}} "Cloud- and Aerosol Chemistry Experiment (CACHE) " project, Kowalski and Vong [1999] observed a persistent and significant divergence of the <b>liquid</b> water <b>fluxes</b> during fog events. This result encouraged us {{to carry out a}} field experiment in order to address the question whether their findings can be confirmed or not. During a measuring campaign in the Fichtelgebirge mountains in Germany, two almost identical eddy covariance measurement set-ups (Burkard et al. 2001) were running simultaneously for measuring the <b>liquid</b> water <b>flux</b> directly. They were mounted on a meteorological tower at different heights. First results show that in contrast to Kowalski and Vong [1999] a flux convergence (corresponding to a sink of liquid water between the two measuring heights) was observed during fog. Calculations have shown that condensation due to updrafts by the mean vertical wind makes a contribution of 9 % to the convergence of the turbulent <b>liquid</b> water <b>fluxes</b> between the two levels. The difference {{in the size of the}} flux footprints and in the distance between the points of the maximum surface influence (both calculated with the flux source [...] area model by Schmid 1994), may partly explain the flux convergence.

40|$|Enrichment in foam {{fractionation}} {{is enhanced}} by reducing the <b>liquid</b> <b>flux</b> while maintaining the flux of bubble surfaces. We show {{that it is possible}} to do so in a continuous foam fractionation column by inserting a plate into the foam layer and forcing the foam through a narrower tube (foam riser) mounted at the centre of the plate. A 35 % reduction in <b>liquid</b> <b>flux</b> was observed by using a single plate-foam riser assembly in a foam stabilised by 0. 52 g/L sodium dodecyl sulphate solution, and the liquid rejected from the foam due to the presence of the foam riser had the same concentration as the feed solution. However, due to the nature of the adsorption isotherm of SDS, the enrichment enhancement measured in the experiments hererin was modest. The mechanism of the foam riser plate was explained by invoking recent theoretical studies on pneumatic foam. It was demonstrated that the reduction in <b>liquid</b> <b>flux</b> was affected by sudden expansion of the flow area causing a rejection of interstitial liquid to the top of the plate and extracted, whence it was recycled back to the feed. Preliminary experiments on the effect of liquid pool depth and foam height on interfacial adsorption were also carried out to demonstrate that the insertion of the plate does not affect the adsorption of the target substance to the bubble surface in the current system. It was found that equilibrium could be achieved within 0. 2 m of liquid pool depth or foam height, however the equilibrium surface excess on a rising bubble in the liquid pool is roughly 51 % of the equilibrium value on a quiescent interface, while that in the foam layer is roughly 73 % of the equilibrium value on a quiescent interface...|$|E

30|$|For a given {{volumetric}} {{fluid flow}} rate per unit area, {{each of these}} so-called pore water exchange cycles {{can be associated with}} a certain equilibration time, which in addition allows to calculate kinetic constraints for mineral dissolution/precipitation (though this functionality was not used in the present study). The system is not constrained to a constant volume, because the volume of fluid phase is kept constant, while the volume of solid phase aggregate was allowed to vary. As the fluid volume is kept constant, the effective porosity would change with each flow and equilibration cycle. Therefore, the time associated with each cycle for a constant Darcy flux is also changing. Actually, for the same <b>liquid</b> <b>flux,</b> a porosity change implies a change of fluid velocity. Different fluid velocities imply different contact times. We made the assumption that the <b>liquid</b> <b>flux</b> is always the same. In reality, porosity changes might also imply changes of <b>liquid</b> <b>flux,</b> which can only be resolved in a fully coupled reactive transport model in which porosity changes imply permeability changes. In a primitive flow-through reactor model, it is even possible to accumulate precipitates in an unphysical way such that the overall solid volume exceeds the initial total volume. In a realistic volume-constrained system, this would cause the porosity clogging that would diminish the volume occupied by the fluid phase, thus stopping the system evolution. However, to make the comparison between the different cases easier, we have made the choice of not stopping the calculations when the total volume of the system becomes unrealistic. In case of unrealistic volume since the first calculation step, {{it would be difficult to}} represent the contributions of various secondary minerals. In addition, it would not be satisfactorily for the cases where the total mineral volume is just below or just above the maximum volume limit.

In this paper a combination of 94 -GHz Doppler radar and backscatter lidar is used to investigate the microphysical properties of drizzle falling below the base of stratocumulus clouds. The ratio of the radar to lidar backscatter power is proportional to the fourth power of mean size so potentially can provide an accurate size estimate.
