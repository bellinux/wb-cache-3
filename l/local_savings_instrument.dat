40|$|Analyzing {{secondary}} and primary data (collected in 2001 - 2002), this paper suggests {{a shift in}} national development policies from solely promoting rural credit to supporting <b>local</b> <b>savings</b> activities. The household data (N = 260) are econometrically analyzed applying conjoint analysis (CA) methodology. The CA gave valuable insights into how to improve outreach of formal financial institutes (FFIs) by adapting the credit products to client preferences and revealed an un-attended demand for <b>savings</b> <b>instruments.</b> Due to the enormous credit outreach of the FFIs in Vietnam, {{it would be more}} efficient to launch a credit consolidation policy and to implement a reliable and sustainable deposit collection system at the village level. However, within national policymaking, a paradigm change must take place and the capability of rural households to save needs to be recognized by policy-makers.

40|$|There is {{a general}} {{agreement}} that financial development {{is a major factor}} influencing economic growth. Financial inclusion implies provision of affordable financial services by the formal financial system to those who are excluded. The strategies for financial inclusion through promotion savings need to consider different <b>savings</b> <b>instruments.</b> Such strategies need to identify unique features that influence different segments of the society to invest in different <b>savings</b> <b>instruments.</b> This paper uses Artificial Neural Networks to identify and rank the factors that influence investment in different <b>savings</b> <b>instruments.</b> These factors could be used to make strategies for enhancing financial inclusion more effective...|$|R

The shortage of <b>saving</b> <b>instruments</b> also makes the world econ-omy vulnerable to financial bubbles.

40|$|The chapter {{presents}} {{a review of}} the literature on tax incentives to long-term saving (exemptions for pension fund and social security contributions, specific <b>saving</b> <b>instruments</b> targeted for retirement) and tax incentives to borrow (mortgage and consumer credit deductibility, special subsidies for housing finance). The chapter places special emphasis on the importance of <b>saving</b> <b>instruments</b> that are available in middle-income countries with relatively developed financial markets (as several Latin America and East-Asian countries), and refer to the most industrialized countries for comparison and empirical evidence. In very poor countries households rely on informal markets for credit transactions, so government intervention has a limited role in shaping household saving and portfolio choice. A careful review of the international tax codes reveals that the most important and widely available household financial assets that are targeted by the tax system are long-term, retirement <b>saving</b> <b>instruments.</b> The tax features of pension funds and social security are of special interest. Almost invariably, mandated contributions to pension funds and to social security are tax exempt, and very often voluntary contributions to long-term savin...|$|R
40|$|We use a novel {{enterprise}} survey from Tanzania {{to gauge}} the relationship between <b>saving</b> <b>instruments</b> and entrepreneurial reinvestment. While most informal savings practices do not imply a lower likelihood of entrepreneurial reinvestment when compared with formal savings practices, we find a significantly negative effect of saving within the household on the likelihood of reinvesting entrepreneurial profits. Our results are robust to an extensive list of robustness checks, including controlling for reverse causation and omitted variable biases. Our work contributes to the recent debate on the implications of different <b>saving</b> <b>instruments</b> in developing countries and expands the entrepreneurial financing constraints literature by focusing on internal rather than external fundings constraints...|$|R
40|$|We analyze whether households' savings {{behaviour}} {{was affected}} by adverse experiences during the crisis and knowledge about banking supervision. Using a survey among Dutch households, we find that both factors have affected the allocation of savings. Individuals whose bank went bankrupt or received government support during the crisis gather more information about banks and <b>saving</b> <b>instruments</b> {{and are more likely}} to have savings at several banks. Respondents with better knowledge about banking supervision are more likely to gather information about banks and <b>saving</b> <b>instruments,</b> to spread their savings across banks, and to shift savings to other banks. savings; financial literacy; financial crisis; household decision-making...|$|R

40|$|We use a novel {{enterprise}} {{survey to}} gauge the relationship between <b>saving</b> <b>instruments</b> and entrepreneurial reinvestment. We show that while most informal saving practices are not associated with a lower likelihood of reinvestment when compared with formal saving practices, there is a significantly lower association of saving within the household with the likelihood of reinvesting profits than other savings form, most importantly, formal saving forms. This result is robust to the model specification and controlling for a large array of variables including district-level fixed effects.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impact of {{increasing}} financial access on low-income people savings. Effects on households’ saving rates and on different informal <b>savings</b> <b>instruments</b> are considered. The paper uses an exogenous expansion of a Mexican savings institute, targeted to low-income people, as a natural experiment and the 1992 and 1994 National Surveys of Income and Expenditures. Results show that the expansion increased the average saving rate of affected households by more than 3 to almost 5 percentage points. The effect was even higher for the poorest households in the sample: their saving rate {{increased by more than}} 7 percentage points in some cases. Furthermore, the expansion, in general, had no effect on highincome households. In the case of informal <b>savings</b> <b>instruments,</b> evidence of crowding out of these instruments caused by the expansion is limited. Results do not {{rule out the possibility that}} a considerable fraction of the increase in households’ savings could have come from new savings...|$|R
