Upper level cyclones can exist without {{the presence of}} a surface low, and can pinch off {{from the base of the}} tropical upper tropospheric trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars and Neptune.|$|E
5|$|Pluto {{has five}} known moons: Charon (the largest, with a {{diameter}} {{just over half}} that of Pluto), Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not <b>lie</b> <b>within</b> either body.|$|E

5|$|Warm fronts are at {{the leading}} edge of a {{homogeneous}} warm air mass, which is located on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and <b>lie</b> <b>within</b> broader troughs of low pressure than cold fronts. A warm front moves more slowly than the cold front which usually follows because cold air is denser and harder to remove from the Earth's surface.|$|E

5|$|Antlia is a faint constellation; its {{brightest}} star is Alpha Antliae, an orange giant {{that is a}} suspected variable star, ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. S Antliae is an eclipsing binary star system, changing in brightness as one star passes {{in front of the}} other. Sharing a common envelope, the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star. Two star systems with known exoplanets, HD 93083 and WASP-66, <b>lie</b> <b>within</b> Antlia, as do NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy, and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Favoring soft-bottomed habitats, the {{peppered}} maskray is a bottom-dwelling predator consuming mainly crustaceans (particularly caridean shrimp) and polychaete worms. It is viviparous, with litter {{sizes of}} one to three. The females supply their developing young with histotroph ("uterine milk") during gestation. Although the peppered maskray is a frequent bycatch of bottom trawl fisheries, it is still common and significant portions of its population appear to <b>lie</b> <b>within</b> unfished waters. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, a cyclone is a {{large scale}} air mass that rotates around a strong center of low {{atmospheric}} pressure. Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the synoptic scale). Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also <b>lie</b> <b>within</b> the synoptic scale.|$|E

5|$|Lake Waiau {{provided}} {{drinking water}} for the workers. Native chiefs would also dip the umbilical cords of newborn babies in its water, {{to give them the}} strength of the mountain. Use of the quarry declined between this period and contact with Americans and Europeans. As part of the ritual associated with quarrying, the workers erected shrines to their gods; these and other quarry artifacts remain at the sites, most of which <b>lie</b> <b>within</b> what is now the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Most of Wilsonville {{is in the}} West Linn-Wilsonville School District (WLWSD), however those {{portions}} {{south of}} the Willamette River are within the Canby School District. Areas just to the west <b>lie</b> <b>within</b> the Sherwood School District. Lowrie Primary, Boeckman Creek and Boones Ferry primary schools serve K-5 students from Wilsonville in WLWSD. Students in grades 6–8 attend Inza R. Wood Middle School, {{and high school students}} attend Wilsonville High School or the Arts and Technology High School (ArtTech). Neither the Canby or Sherwood districts operate schools within Wilsonville.|$|E
5|$|Shapley's {{measurements}} {{also indicated}} that the Sun is relatively far {{from the center of}} the galaxy, also contrary to what had previously been inferred from the apparently nearly even distribution of ordinary stars. In reality, most ordinary stars <b>lie</b> <b>within</b> the galaxy's disk and those stars that lie in the direction of the galactic centre and beyond are thus obscured by gas and dust, whereas globular clusters lie outside the disk and can be seen at much further distances.|$|E

5|$|The {{field is}} so small {{that only a few}} {{foreground}} stars in the Milky Way <b>lie</b> <b>within</b> it; thus, almost all of the 3,000 objects in the image are galaxies, some of which are among the youngest and most distant known. By revealing such large numbers of very young galaxies, the HDF has become a landmark image {{in the study of the}} early universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{fine-tuned}} Universe is {{the proposition}} that the conditions that allow life in the Universe can only occur when certain universal fundamental physical constants <b>lie</b> <b>within</b> a very narrow range, so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the Universe would be unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of matter, astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood. The proposition is discussed among philosophers, scientists, theologians, and proponents of creationism.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbit of}} Adrastea lies inside Jupiter's {{synchronous}} orbit radius (as does Metis's), {{and as a}} result, tidal forces are slowly causing its orbit to decay {{so that it will}} one day impact Jupiter. If its density is similar to Amalthea's then its orbit would actually <b>lie</b> <b>within</b> the fluid Roche limit. However, since it is not breaking up, it must still lie outside its rigid Roche limit.|$|E
