40|$|With growing {{demands on}} primary care and a {{shortage}} of primary care clinicians, safety-net clinics are asking, What {{is the role of}} the registered nurse (RN) in primary care? This report describes how 11 community health centers and county health systems in California, as well as two health centers outside California, are using the following strategies to expand the RN role in primary care: Provide RNs with additional training in primary care skills, so they can make more clinical decisions. Empower RNs to make more clinical decisions, using standardized procedures. Reduce the triage burden on RNs to free up time for other responsibilities. Include RNs on care teams, allowing them to focus on their team's patients. Implement RN-led new-patient visits to increase patient access to care. Offer patients co-visits in which RNs conduct most of the visit, with providers joining in at the end. Deploy RNs as "tactical nurses. " Provide patients with RN-led chronic care management visits. Employ RNs' skills to care-manage patients with complex health care needs. Train some RNs to take responsibility for specialized functions. Schedule RNs to perform different roles on different days. Preserve the traditional RN role and focus on training medical assistants (MAs) and <b>licensed</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>nurses</b> (<b>LVNs)</b> to take on new responsibilities...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] For 10 days in April 1987 {{the nurses}} who draw blood at Red Cross blood centers in Los Angeles and Orange {{counties}} were on strike. Try to picture their situation: These were 225 {{workers who are}} spread out at 30 different worksites covering 9, 000 square miles. To conduct a membership meeting required strikers to drive {{as much as two}} hours. Besides being geographically dispersed, the workforce is divided between Registered <b>Nurses</b> (RNs) and <b>Licensed</b> <b>Vocational</b> <b>Nurses</b> (<b>LVNs),</b> whose status and salaries were grossly disproportionate. And who were they on strike against? Not arrogant, greedy corporations like GE and USX, whose only purpose in life is to make more money this year than last? No, they were on strike against the Red Cross — an international symbol of nonpartisan humanitarianism. And the key to the strike was to dry up Red Cross 2 ̆ 7 blood supply, upon which 200 hospitals depend. How easy could it be for editorial cartoonists to depict the nurses as vampires sucking the blood out of Los Angeles! Any labor leader in her right mind would understand immediately that this was a strike that could not be won. But it was won, and the sisterhood that made it possible should be an inspiration to a labor movement that is struggling to renew itself...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundSince smoking has a {{profound}} impact on socioeconomic disparities in illness and death, it is crucial that vulnerable populations of smokers be targeted with treatment. The US Public Health Service recommends that all patients be asked about their smoking at every visit, and that smokers be given brief advice to quit and referred to treatment. PurposeInitiatives to facilitate these practices include the 5 A 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s (i. e., Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and Ask Advise Refer (AAR). Unfortunately, primary care referrals are low, and most smokers referred fail to enroll. This study evaluated the efficacy of the Ask Advise Connect (AAC) approach to linking smokers with treatment in a large, safety-net public healthcare system. DesignPair-matched-two-treatment arm group-randomized trial. Setting/participantsTen safety-net clinics in Houston, TX. InterventionClinics were randomized to AAC (n= 5; intervention) or AAR (n= 5; control). <b>Licensed</b> <b>Vocational</b> <b>Nurses</b> (<b>LVNs)</b> were trained to assess and record the smoking status of all patients at all visits in the electronic health record (EHR). Smokers were given brief advice to quit. In AAC, the names and phone numbers of smokers who agreed to be connected were sent electronically to the Texas Quitline daily, and patients were proactively called within 48 hours. In AAR, smokers were offered a Quitline referral card and encouraged to call on their own. Data were collected between June 2010 and March 2012 and analyzed in 2012.

40|$|Abstract Background:The {{purpose of}} this DNP project was to {{synthesize}} evidenced based-research related to Tdap vaccination against pertussis for family members of pregnant and postpartum women {{in order to provide}} protection from pertussis for newborn infants through cocooning. Cocooning refers to the vaccination of family members and caregivers in close contact with the infant to protect the infant by lowering risk of acquiring pertussis from close contact through an infected family member. Methods: This project utilized the Health Belief Model to understand perceptions and predict behaviors related to the pertussis vaccination of family members who may come in contact with unvaccinated infants. A toolkit was provided to the nursing staff at the University of California San Francisco Benioff Children’s Hospital, including an educational handout for nurses to use to educate family members of newly postpartum women. The goal was to improve Tdap vaccination rates among family members to protect newborn infants from acquiring pertussis. Results: Thirty-six nursing staff participated in the educational sessions (five in clinic, 36 from the birth center). The majority of the respondents were Registered Nurses (n = 32) and some were <b>Licensed</b> <b>Vocational</b> <b>Nurses</b> (<b>LVN)</b> (n = 4). Five areas were addressed through pre and post intervention surveys that assessed the following: Knowledge of pertussis or whooping cough; Knowledge about the term “protection through cocooning”; Likelihood of using an educational tool/handout for patients and families; Likelihood that an educational tool will be useful to patients; and Likelihood for an educational tool to increase rates of pertussis vaccinations. Overall, there was a statistically significant result in the likelihood that the nurses would use an educational tool or handout to educate their patient and their family members about pertussis (p 3 ̆c. 001). The mean score of nurses’ likelihood that an educational tool will be useful to patients after to receiving the educational session was 4. 78 (SD = 0. 42). This represented a statistically significant difference in the mean pre- and post-education scores for the likelihood that an educational tool will be useful to patients. Conclusions: Nurses are the forefront of patient care and nursing education in an acute setting. They are trusted and reliable sources for healthcare information and education. Through this study we have examined the likelihood to use a tool or handout after an educational session. Nurses on this unit have expressed that after an educational session, they were more knowledgeable of the subject matter and the information would be useful to patients to improve pertussis education for pregnant women and their family members...|$|R
40|$|California’s elderly {{population}} over age 85 {{is estimated to}} grow 361 % by the year 2050. Many of these elders are frail and highly dependent on caregivers making them more likely to need nursing home care. A 1998 United States Government Accountability Office report identified poor quality of care in California nursing homes. This report spurred multiple Assembly Bills in California designed to increase nursing home nurse staffing, change the state’s Medi-Cal reimbursement methodology, or both. The legislation culminated in Assembly Bill (AB) 1629, signed into law in September 2004, which included the Long-Term Care Reimbursement Act. This legislation changed the state’s Medi-Cal reimbursement from a prospective, flat rate to a prospective, cost-based methodology and was designed in part to increase nursing home nurse staffing. It is estimated that this methodology change moved California from the bottom 10 % of Medicaid nursing home reimbursement rates nationwide to the top 25 %. This study analyzed the effect of AB 1629 on a panel of 567 free-standing nursing homes that were in continuous operation between the years 2002 – 2007. Resource Dependence Theory was used to construct the conceptual framework. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and first differencing with instrumental variable estimation procedures were used to test five hypotheses concerning Medi-Cal resource dependence, bed size, competition (including assisted living facilities and home health agencies), resource munificence, and slack resources. Both a 15 and 25 mile fixed radius were used as alternative market definitions instead of counties. The OLS results supported that case-mix adjusted <b>licensed</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>nurse</b> (<b>LVN)</b> and total nurse staffing hours per resident day increased overall. Nursing homes with the highest Medi-Cal dependence increased only increased NA staffing more than nursing homes with the lowest Medi-Cal dependence post AB 1629. The fixed effects with instrumental variable estimation procedure provided marginal support that nursing homes with more home health agency competition, in a 15 mile market, had higher LVN staffing. This estimation procedure also supported that nursing homes with more slack resources (post AB 1629) increased nurse aide and total nurse staffing while nursing homes located in markets with {{a greater percentage of}} residents over the age of 85 had more nurse aide staffing...|$|E

25|$|To work in {{the nursing}} profession, all nurses hold one or more {{credentials}} depending on their scope of practice and education. A licensed practical nurse (LPN) (also {{referred to as a}} <b>licensed</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>nurse,</b> registered practical nurse, enrolled nurse, and state enrolled nurse) works independently or with a registered nurse (RN). The most significant differentiation between an LPN and RN is found in the requirements for entry to practice, which determines entitlement for their scope of practice. For example, Canada requires a bachelor's degree for the RN and a two-year diploma for the LPN. A registered nurse provides scientific, psychological, and technological knowledge in the care of patients and families in many health care settings.
