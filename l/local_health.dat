5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at <b>local</b> <b>health</b> facilities or during conversations with friends or family members, {{people are more likely}} to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses. In addition, women are more likely than men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E
40|$|The National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP) has {{developed}} performance standards measurement instruments, {{based on the}} 10 "Essential Services of Public Health" that are being tested in several states. This article is {{a report on the}} face and content validity of the instrument designed for <b>local</b> public <b>health</b> systems. Judgments about the face validity of the standards were obtained in a survey of <b>local</b> public <b>health</b> systems that had used the instrument in a test state. The validity of each standard was addressed along the following dimensions: the importance of the standard as a measure of the Essential Service; its completeness as a measure; and its reasonableness for achievement. All standards for each Essential Service were then judged in terms of their completeness in measuring performance of that service. Respondents judged the standards to be highly valid measures of <b>local</b> public <b>health</b> system performance. Some respondents had reservations about whether standards related to "enforcing laws and regulations" were achievable. Holding <b>local</b> public <b>health</b> systems accountable for the activities of other agencies was a factor mentioned in conjunction with those standards. The NPHPSP standards have face and content validity for measuring <b>local</b> public <b>health</b> system performance. Further testing of their validity and reliability is continuing...|$|R

5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the general health condition of the patient, the <b>local</b> <b>health</b> condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of {{the bones of the}} jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.|$|E
5|$|Despite Malawi's limited {{health and}} {{educational}} infrastructure, knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS is high among many {{people living in}} both urban and rural Malawi. According to a 2004 study by Barden-O'Fallon et al. involving 100 households, women in Malawi {{are most likely to}} learn about HIV/AIDS through radio and television, health workers at local clinics, and female members of their social networks. Men are also likely to access information about HIV/AIDS through radio and television; however, unlike women, they are not likely to gain information about HIV/AIDS from their male friends. When 57 Malawian men were interviewed in 2003, 100% of them said they had heard about the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the radio, and 84.2% of them said they had learned about HIV/AIDS during their visits to <b>local</b> <b>health</b> facilities; this supports the fact that many people in Malawi have access to information about the epidemic, both through the radio and other sources.|$|E

After 9 / 11, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) began to plan for bioterrorism and other possible public health emergencies and found that having 351 separate departments made emergency planning difficult and dispersing of funds a challenge.
