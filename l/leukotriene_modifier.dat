40|$|Background: Children {{with mild}} sleep-disordered {{breathing}} (SDB), {{who may not}} be recommended for adenotonsillectomy, frequently exhibit neurocognitive and behavioral morbidity, and may benefit from alternative therapeutic interventions, such as <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifier</b> therapy. Methods: Twenty-four children with SDB completed an open-label intervention study for 16 weeks with daily montelukast therapy. Sleep studies and adenoid size estimates from lateral X-ray films of the neck were obtained before and after treatment. In a parallel study, adenoid and tonsillar tissues from children with obstructive sleep apnea or recurrent throat infections were subjected to quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting for gene and protein expression of leukotriene receptors LT 1 -R and LT 2 -R, and for concentrations of LTB 4 and LTC 4 /D 4 /E 4. Results: Montelukast treatment induced significant reductions in adenoid size and respiratory-related sleep disturbances, which were absent in 16 children with SDB who did not receive treatment. LT 1 -R and LT 2 -R mRNA was similarly abundant in adenoid tissues, but increased LT 1 -R and LT 2 -R protein expression and higher levels of LTB 4 and LTC 4 /D 4 /E 4 emerged in children with obstructive sleep apnea. Conclusions: Oral therapy with a <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifier</b> appears to be associated with improved breathing during sleep. Double-blind, placebo-controlled trials will be needed to corroborate current findings and solidly establish antiinflammatory strategies, such as leukotriene modifiers, as therapeutic alternatives in children with SDB too mild to justify referral for adenotonsillectomy...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} asthma control after the introduction of a <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifier</b> (Montelukast), in addition to the current controller asthma therapies, in patients with inadequately controlled mild-to-moderate persistent asthma. Asthma control and patient perception were assessed prior to, and 4 weeks after, the introduction of Montelukast, and the pre-introduction and post-introduction results were compared. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, observational study collected information on 1, 490 eligible adult asthmatic patients in Saudi Arabia. The eligibility criteria included patients aged 15 years or more with symptomatic mild-to-moderate persistent asthma despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids with or without long-acting beta agonist; also, the patient should attend the initial visit and follow-up visits after at least 4 weeks. Results: Of the 1, 490 eligible patients, 79. 5 &#x 0025; received inhaled corticosteroids alone, and the remaining 20. 5 &#x 0025; received combination of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilator. Despite the treatment with daily controller medications, asthma symptoms persisted in more than two-thirds of the study population. Upon adding Montelukast, more than 80 &#x 0025; of patients reported improvement in symptoms, which was consistent in all patients irrespective of corticosteroid type or dose (stratum) or the addition of long-acting &# 946; 2 -agonist. At the follow-up visit, 92. 2 &#x 0025; of patients reported that they felt better on Montelukast.

40|$|Antileukotriene {{drugs are}} new {{therapeutic}} agents that {{have recently been}} approved {{for the treatment of}} asthma. Several cases of eosinophilic conditions including Churg-Strauss syndrome have been reported to be associated with zafirlukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene type 1 receptor antagonist. So far no other <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifier</b> has been associated with the syndrome. The case history is presented of a man with allergic rhinitis and asthma who had received intermittent pulse therapy with oral corticosteroids. Pulmonary eosinophilia developed while he was receiving treatment with montelukast, a chemically distinct cysteinyl leukotriene type 1 receptor antagonist. After discontinuation of montelukast therapy and administration of systemic corticosteroids the patient's symptoms reversed rapidly and there was prompt resolution of the pulmonary infiltrates. We believe that cysteinyl leukotriene type 1 receptor antagonists are safe and effective drugs for most patients with asthma but caution is needed for those with more severe disease who require systemic corticosteroids, especially if they show characteristics of the atypical allergic diathesis seen in the prodromal phase of Churg-Strauss syndrome. ...|$|E

40|$|Asthma is {{the most}} common chronic {{disorder}} in industrialised nations, with over 100 million people worldwide affected. Leukotrienes are chemical mediators released from mast cells, eosinophils and basophils. They cause bronchoconstriction, an increase in mucous secretions and activation of inflammatory cells. <b>Leukotriene</b> <b>modifiers</b> are a long-term controller medication used to treat asthma. They function by selectively competing for the leukotriene receptor sites, thereby blocking their action, or by inhibiting 5 -lipoxygenase and thus preventing leukotriene formation. Both current US and Global Initiative for Asthma treatment guidelines have clarified the role of <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifiers</b> in the management of asthma in adults and children. <b>Leukotriene</b> <b>modifiers</b> have two distinct roles: to replace inhaled corticosteroids in milder asthma and as an add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids in more severe asthma. While efficacy is certainly an important issue, economic considerations are also important in a disease such as asthma where {{there are a variety of}} treatment options and the severity of the disease varies widely.

40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityAsthma is {{the most}} common {{respiratory}} disease encountered by nurse practitioners in clinical practice. There is no cure for asthma and it is not always controlled with existing therapies. Leukotrienes are recognized as the major causing factor in the pathology of asthma. Leukotrienes promote bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, vascular leak and edema formation. Over the past decade a number of agents, known as <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifiers</b> or antagonists, have been introduced and approved for the treatment of patients with asthma. Studies demonstrate the effectiveness of leukotreine antagonists in modifying bronchospasm with exercise, pulmonary reaction to aspirin in sensitive patients, and airway response to inhaled antigen. In patients with chronic asthma, <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifiers</b> improve airflow obstruction, diminish asthma symptoms and decrease use of beta-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids. The goal of this paper is twofold: 1) to assist the nurse practitioner to make appropriate decisions about antileukotriene use; and 2) to delineate criteria used when selecting patients who will benefit from therapy with <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifiers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Unexpected {{aspects of}} the {{antiasthmatic}} efficacy of leukotriene modifiers and glucocorticosteroids have been observed. For both classes, the observed effects may be partially explainable {{on the basis of}} underrecognized interactions involving leukotrienes. This review examines the interactions between leukotrienes and other mediators of asthma. It details the effects of glucocorticosteroids on leukotriene synthesis and on leukocyte populations in asthmatic airways. Unexpected controller effects of the leukotriene modifiers may reflect the fact that leukotrienes and other mediators of asthma, such as TH 2 cytokines, positively influence each other's generation. The ability of the leukotriene modifiers to disrupt such extensive interactions means that other relevant mediators are targeted indirectly by leukotriene blockade. Among asthma therapies, the glucocorticosteroids have numerous anti-inflammatory activities, but their effects may be unpredictable. Many processes involved in inflammation appear to escape modulation by glucocorticosteroids, including leukotriene synthesis, and leukotriene generation is among them. Understanding whether glucocorticosteroids reduce cysteinyl leukotriene levels in the airway is important in determining the clinical value of combining glucocorticosteroid therapy with <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifier</b> therapy...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cytokines {{including}} Interleukin- 5 play a {{key role}} in orchestrating the chronic inflammation of asthma. We aimed to determine the level of serum IL- 5 in partly controlled atopic asthma in children and to assess the effect of different therapies on their levels. METHODS: The study included 40 children aged 6 - 12 years with partly controlled asthma. Cases were randomly divided into two groups; group ‘A’ receiving Leukotriene modifiers and group ‘B’ receiving inhaled corticosteroids; each for two months. They were compared to 20 healthy non-asthmatic, matched controls. Serum IL- 5 was measured for cases on the first visit and two months after therapy. Absolute eosinophilic count and serum Ig-E were determined. Pulmonary function testing was performed using spirometer at the beginning and two months after regular therapy. RESULTS: Serum Interleukin- 5 was significantly increased in asthmatic children during exacerbation and was significantly decreased after treatment. ROC curve analysis showed significant difference of IgE and PEFR after treatment with <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifier</b> only. CONCLUSION: Serum IL- 5 seems to have a role in asthma pathogenesis.

Patients were identified who had at least one ICD- 9 (493. XX) claim for asthma and were newly prescribed inhaled fluticasone propionate 44 μ g (FP) or montelukast 5 or 10 mg (MON). Subjects could not have had a claim for any inhaled corticosteroid or oral <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifier</b> in 9 months prior to the first prescription claim for either FP or MON.

Asthma-related costs were adjusted for age, gender, health plan, co-morbidities, pre-index asthma medication use and pre-index asthma care costs. Multi-variate regression analysis, adjusting for baseline covariates, indicated that compared to treatment with montelukast, treatment with FP had significantly (P< 0 · 001) lower post-index total asthma related costs.

40|$|There {{is limited}} {{information}} on which data primary care pediatricians (PCPs) use {{to decide whether}} to prescribe or not asthma maintenance treatment, and what drives prescribing a specific therapy. The study aim was to investigate how prescribing anti-asthma maintenance treatment to preschool wheezing children is influenced by patient, family, environmental, and PCP characteristics. We conducted a cross-sectional study at 32 PCPs sites in Campania, Italy. Medical, family, and environmental information of 376 preschool wheezy children, and characteristics of the enrolled PCPs were collected. Main outcome measures of multilevel multivariate logistic regression analyses were the prescribing of maintenance treatment, and the prescription of a combined therapy as opposed to monotherapy. Variables significantly associated with long-term inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and/or <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifiers</b> prescription included frequent wheezing (OR[*]=[*] 7. 19), emergency department (ED) visits (OR[*]=[*] 2. 21), personal allergic diseases (OR[*]=[*] 8. 49), day-care/kindergarten attendance (OR[*]=[*] 2. 67), a high PCP prescribing volume (OR[*]=[*] 2. 74), and a low proportion of 0 - to 5 -year-old patients with wheezing diagnosis (OR[*]=[*] 1. 16). <b>Leukotriene</b> <b>modifiers</b> plus ICS were much more likely prescribed than ICS or <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifiers</b> alone to older children (OR[*]=[*] 1. 06) and to patients experiencing frequent wheezing (OR[*]=[*] 3. 00), ED visits (OR[*]=[*] 3. 12), or tobacco smoke exposure during the first 2 years of life (OR[*]=[*] 2. 04). Finally, PCP's characteristics significantly associated with ICS plus <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifiers</b> prescription were group practice (OR[*]=[*] 4. 16) and a high prescribing volume (OR[*]=[*] 1. 45).

40|$|A {{report on}} our {{clinical}} experience based on 3 male patients who developed Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) after standard oral montelukast use. All patients affected by moderate asthma and chronic hyperplastic rhinosinusitis {{were treated with}} inhaled corticosteroids and ß 2 agonists. Systemic corticosteroid treatment consisted in oral daily prednisone in case 1, in short courses of oral betamethasone in case 2, and in remote and isolated administrations of oral betamethasone and intramuscular methylprednisolone in case 3. Because of {{the improvement of the}} asthma symptoms after montelukast use, patient 1 decided to take half the dose of prednisone for 10 days and patient 2 decided to discontinue systemic and inhaled corticosteroids for 45 days. Overt CSS was heralded by vasculitic skin lesions and developed in each patient with severe organ damage, consisting in renal, myocardial and gastrointestinal involvement. Remission was obtained by standard CSS therapy after montelukast withdrawal. According to the unmasking hypothesis, antileukotriene treatment, by enabling the reduction in systemic corticosteroid therapy in case 1 and its discontinuation in case 2, might have only permitted the precipitation of the vasculitis. However antileukotriene-associated CSS reportedly occurred in systemic corticosteroidnaïve patients and relapsed in one patient after antileukotriene treatment. These observations lend support to the concept that the precipitation of the vasculitic phase may be associated with <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifier</b> deleterious effects.

We evaluated the additive effects of LM with ICS on pulmonary function and airway inflammation in asthmatics with or without AR. Methods: Eighteen uncontrolled steroid-treated asthmatics, nine with and nine without AR, were enrolled. Spirometry, peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements, and exhaled breath condensate sampling were performed before and 8 weeks after LM administration. The lowest PEF over the course of one week, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} highest PEF (Min%Max PEF), was used as an index of fluctuation of the airway caliber. Airway cytokine expression was analyzed with a protein array. Results: A significant improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second as a percentage of the predicted value (%FEV 1) and Min%Max PEF was seen in the subgroup of asthma with AR. Although there was no significant difference in the baseline cytokine values between the groups, the exhaled RANTES level was significantly reduced by LM in the asthma with AR group. The changes in the RANTES level were significantly related to the changes in the %FEV 1 and Min%Max PEF values.

Materials and methods: Asthma-related medical claims from two major health plans were obtained for the 12 months {{before and after the}} initiation of dual therapy. A total of 1, 325 patients> 12 years old with no claims for COPD or respiratory tract cancer were selected from the approximately 3. 5 million lives covered. Multivariable regression was used to assess differences in asthma-related expenditures. To compensate for positive skew, all cost variables were log-trans-formed. Results: Risk-adjusted total asthma-related costs for the fluticasone-plus-salmeterol cohort (n 121), the ICS-plus-salmeterol cohort (n 844), and the ICS-plus-LTM cohort (n 30) were $ 975, $ 1, 089, and $ 1, 268, respectively. Risk-adjusted pharmacy costs were $ 813, $ 841, and $ 996, respectively. Generalized linear modeling, controlling for baseline covariates, indicated that compared to ICS-plus-LTM therapy, fluticasone-plus-salmeterol therapy was associated with a significant reduction in asthma-related total (p 0. 0014) and pharmacy (p 0. 001) costs. Similar results were found when the ICS-plus-salmeterol group and the ICS-plus-LTM group were compared (p 0. 0001). The number of inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department visits and their corresponding costs were lower for the fluticasone-plus-salmeterol cohort, but were not statistically significant (p> 0. 05).

40|$|PURPOSE: Case reports {{suggest that}} <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifier</b> use may be {{associated}} with the onset of Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS). Using pooled data from two nested case-control studies, we examined the association between asthma drug use and the development of CSS. METHODS: The study was performed in three US managed care organizations and a US national health plan with chart access and complete electronic pharmacy data, with a covered population of 13. 9 million. There were 47 cases of possible or definite CSS and 4700 asthma drug user controls identified between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2002. We examined exposure to asthma drugs in cases and controls, including leukotriene modifiers (6 cases and 202 controls), in the two to 6 months prior to the onset of adjudicated CSS. RESULTS: While the crude association between use of leukotriene modifiers and CSS was strong (odds ratio (OR) 4. 00, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 49 - 10. 60), in a multivariable analysis controlling for use of oral corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids, and number of categories of asthma drugs dispensed, there was no significant association (OR 1. 32, 95 % CI: 0. 44 - 3. 96).

ResultsAt baseline, mean ± SD total daily ICS doses were 680  ±  414  μg/d in new starts, 642  ±  431  μg/d in established users, and 548  ±  382  μg/d in non-omalizumab patients. From baseline through year 2, total ICS dose decreased in 65 % of new starts (mean ± SD change, − 393  ±  504  μg/d), 57 % of established users (− 287  ±  492  μg/d), and 54 % of non-omalizumab patients (− 232  ±  431  μg/d). At baseline, SABA use for new starts, established users, and non-omalizumab patients was 1. 9, 1. 3, and 1. 4  puffs/d, respectively. At year 2, SABA use decreased in 65 % of new starts, 55 % of established users, and 54 % of non-omalizumab patients. At year 2, LTM dose decreased in 52 % of new starts, 44 % of established users, and 40 % of non-omalizumab patients. ConclusionOmalizumab therapy initiation was associated with decreased doses of ICS, SABA, and LTM over 2 years of follow-up {{for the majority of}} patients in a “real-world” cohort study of moderate-to-severe allergic asthma patients...|$|E

The treatment of {{allergic rhinitis}} includes allergen avoidance, environmental controls, pharmacologic treatment, and specific immunotherapy. Objectives: The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the clinical changes and the levels of interferon-&gamma; (IFN-&gamma;) and interleukin- 5 (IL- 5) in nasal lavage fluid from children with allergic rhinitis after different types of pharmacologic treatment (mometasone, montelukast, or desloratadine). Methods: Twenty-four children aged from six to 12 years with moderate persistent allergic rhinitis were randomized into three groups receiving monotherapy treatment over four weeks: nasal corticosteroid (mometasone), <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifier</b> (montelukast), or antihistamine (desloratadine). The perception of symptom improvement during the medication use was evaluated at the end of the treatment. Samples of nasal lavage fluid were collected before and after treatment for measuring IFN-&gamma; and IL- 5 cytokines by ELISA. Results: All parents perceived an improvement in symptoms. Significant enhancement was seen in the mometasone group compared to those with montelukast (P = 0. 01) and desloratadine (P = 0. 02). No significant differences were found among the three groups in the levels of IL- 5 and IFN-&gamma; in nasal fluid at baseline or after treatment. Only the group treated with mometasone showed a slight but significant reduction in IL- 5 levels after the treatment period as compared with levels before the treatment (P = 0. 0469). Conclusion: The group treated with mometasone showed better improvement of clinical symptoms and a slight reduction in IL- 5 levels in the nasal fluid. This may indirectly reflect the relative immunomodulatory effects of the drugs tested.

40|$|As {{treatment}} for {{moderate to severe}} persistent asthma, inhaled corticosteroid drugs combined with long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists are being marketed in a single inhaler device. These combination products have important benefits (e. g. convenience, improved adherence, and improved day-to-day asthma symptom control); however, there are also problems (e. g. risk of severe asthma flares associated with long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist therapy, high price of combination inhalers, and limited ability to titrate the dose of each component independently). Combination therapy {{is most likely to}} benefit patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma whose disease is not controlled on inhaled corticosteroids alone. Some patients may prefer this combination product to inhaled corticosteroids plus a <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifier</b> or theophylline. For other patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma, inhaled corticosteroid adherence may be improved by use of the combination product. Combination long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist/inhaled corticosteroid therapy is not appropriate for patients with predominantly exercise-induced asthma, patients unable to use the inhaler device, patients with either mild intermittent or mild persistent asthma, and patients whose asthma can be controlled on a low to moderate dose of inhaled corticosteroid medication alone. As currently priced, combination long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist/inhaled corticosteroid therapy leads to increased costs compared with inhaled corticosteroids alone; however, in appropriately selected patients, this cost is offset by improvements in asthma symptoms and lung function. Some patients may value increases in symptom-free days, convenience, and a less offensive taste (especially with a dry-powder inhaler delivery system). Others may prefer drug minimization and/or may prefer metered-dose inhaler or nebulizer delivery systems. Providers {{need to be able to}} match the medication to the medical needs and preferences of the patient/family as best as possible. Providers need to be able to educate the patient and/or parents on the role of the medication, expected results, and inhalation techniques. Inappropriate use of combination therapy, such as for individuals with only mild asthma whose asthma can be controlled on simpler therapy, should be avoided. Health plans are accountable for both quality and costs of care. They are interested in restricting inappropriate use of combination therapy.

40|$|Background: Asthma {{is one of}} {{the most}} common chronic {{diseases}} in the US, and its prevalence continues to increase. Despite the availability of effective asthma controller medications, many patients with asthma are still not meeting therapeutic goals because of poor disease management. The high disease prevalence combined with the high costs associated with the poor management of asthma, make patients with asthma a costly group to treat for managed care organisations (MCOs) and this motivates decision makers in MCOs to consider both the clinical and economic value of asthma therapies. Objective: To compare the cost effectiveness of first-line controller asthma therapies in patients with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma from an MCO payer perspective. Methods: A decision-analysis model was developed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol administered in a single inhaler (salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50 / 100 mug), compared with fluticasone propionate inhaled corticosteroids (FPIC), non-fluticasone propionate inhaled corticosteroids (nFPIC) and <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifiers.</b> The model estimated costs ($US, year 2005 values) and health outcomes over a 1 -year period. Costs and outcomes data were obtained from published clinical trials and observational studies, and model assumptions on the relationship between adherence and effectiveness were evaluated by a panel of experts. Effectiveness measures included symptom-free days and rescue medication-free days. The cost effectiveness of first-line asthma therapies was compared using a step-wise approach, with FPIC as the reference case. Both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of results over a range of assumptions. Results: The step-wise comparison found that the additional costs for achieving an incremental effectiveness unit (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) using single-inhaler salmeterol/fluticasone propionate compared with FPIC was $US 9. 55 per symptom-free day and $US 8. 93 per rescue medication-free day. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the model was robust to changes in base-case assumptions. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that, corresponding to a benchmark value of $US 14. 8 per symptom-free day, the probabilities that single-inhaler salmeterol/fluticasone propionate, n-FPIC and <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifiers</b> were more cost effective than FPIC were 98 %, 30. 7 % and 2. 1 %, respectively. Conclusion: Based on our decision analysis, the additional costs for achieving incremental effectiveness with single-inhaler salmeterol/fluticasone propionate treatment compared with FPIC and nFPIC may be lower than the commonly accepted benchmark value for cost effectiveness, based on published estimates of the utility losses associated with asthma symptoms. Single-inhaler salmeterol/fluticasone propionate may also be more cost effective than <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifiers.</b> Asthma, Corticosteroids, Cost-effectiveness, Fluticasone-propionate, Leukotriene-antagonists, Salmeterol/fluticasone-propionate...|$|R
40|$|The paper reviews current {{knowledge}} on genetic background of action of drugs used in asthma treatment. In this aspect, glucocorticosteroids, <b>leukotriene</b> <b>modifiers,</b> 2 adrenoceptor agonists {{as well as}} methylxantines are discussed. The authors analyze different outcomes of treatment in subjects with non-wild-type genotype as compared to wild-type ones. For glucocorticosteroids, {{we focus on the}} polymorphism of corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 and the intracellularly located glucocorticoid receptor that exists in two variants (glucocorticoid receptor – GR and GR) created during alternative splicing of exon 9 to exon 9. It is hypothesized that this polymorphism may be responsible for the reduced responsiveness to glucocorticosteroids in GR-predominant-subjects. For <b>leukotriene,</b> <b>modifiers</b> of two enzymes are reviewed: arachidonate 5 -lipoxygenasae (ALOX 5) and leukotriene C 4 (LTC 4) synthase. Especially LTC 4 Ss promoter has several described single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), where the – 444 C is supposed to be associated with enhanced LTC 4 production and, therefore, poorer response to leukotriene receptor antagonist treatment. 2 Adrenoceptor polymorphism has been widely studied recently. At least 55 SNPs have been identified, with Arg-Gly 16 polymorphism and Gln-Glu 27 polymorphism being the most frequent ones. It has been demonstrated that patients homozygous for Arg 16 produce significantly diminished response to 2 agonist treatment. Further, we discuss a possible role of CpG DNA motifs as adjuvants in immunotherapy of allergic diseases as well as modulators of children’s immune system preventing development of allergic diseases. We conclude that, however there are medical disciplines where pharmacogenetics is in clinical use, in allergy and asthma we need further studies to evaluate potential risks and benefits.

40|$|Preclinical {{atherosclerosis}} {{represents a}} crucial period associated with several pathophysiological reactions in the vascular wall. Failure to diagnose preclinical atherosclerosis {{at this stage}} misses a major opportunity to prevent the long-term consequences of this disease. Surrogate biological and structural vascular markers are available to determine the presence and the extension of preclinical vascular injury in the general population. Examples of surrogate markers are carotid intima media thickness and biomarkers including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, cell adhesion molecules and matrix metalloproteinases, and leukotrienes. Recently, leukotrienes have been implicated as mediators, biomarkers, and possible therapeutic targets {{in the context of}} subclinical atherosclerosis.

40|$|Leukotriene {{overproduction}} is {{the major}} characteristic of aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA). Most studies examining the molecular genetic mechanisms of AIA have focused on leukotriene-related genes, including ALOX 5, LTC 4 S, TXA 2 R and prostanoid-receptor genes. One study suggested that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele DPB 1 * 0301 may be a genetic marker for the AIA phenotype in European and Asian populations, and HLA-DPB 1 * 0301 has been suggested as a useful genetic marker for predicting more favorable responders to leukotriene-receptor antagonists for long-term management of AIA.
