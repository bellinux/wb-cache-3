5000|$|There is {{no doubt}} {{developing}} VS Packages {{is the most powerful}} way to add functionality to Visual Studio. The clear evidence for this {{is the fact that the}} whole Visual Studio functionality is built from packages integrated into the shell. All the languages, editors, the debugger, the project system and many more components are packages. From the developer point of view it actually means that adding a new package to VS is just like adding core functionality to the VS IDE as if it were developed by Microsoft. The IDE does not make any distinction between Microsoft-created and third-party components; developers see all packages as part of VS IDE. Packages are binaries developed with the preferred language (C#, VB,.NET or C++), so from intellectual property guarding aspect they can be as safe as other [...]NET binaries.Installing packages is a more complex task for developers than setting up add-ins. Registration of packages affects a broader part of the Visual Studio registry entries and is helped by a utility called RegPkg.exe. Visual Studio checks if it can trust a package by a signing mechanism that uses a so-called Package <b>Load</b> <b>Key.</b> This PLK can be obtained from Microsoft and is a kind of digital hash for the package. When the package is installed into a production environment, its PLK is verified.Visual Studio SDK ships a few extensibility project templates that make the creation of package frames as easy as an add-in.|$|E

This paper proposes {{a novel approach}} to study the formation mechanism and dynamic development of surface mining-induced fissures in shallow coal seam mining. This approach combines field tests, theoretical analysis, and numerical simulations based on the geological condition of shallow coal seam mining in Chuancao Gedan Coal Mine. Two typical surface mining-induced fissures, step-type fissures and collapse-type fissures, are generated in shallow coal seam mining. The fissures with large vertical throw or horizontal opening severely impact water resource protection and surface ecological environment. Surface mining-induced fissures are generated periodically and changed dynamically with the advancing of working face. The vertical throw and horizontal opening of surface fissures are changed dynamically with the movement of <b>loading</b> <b>key</b> strata. The movement forms of <b>loading</b> <b>key</b> strata determine the morphological development of surface fissures.

40|$|Abstract. Smartphones {{have become}} a daily {{companion}} in recent years due to their small form factor. However, such mobile systems are resource-constrained in view of computational power, storage and battery life. Offloading resource-intensive tasks (aka mobile cloud computing) to dis-tant (e. g., cloud computing) or closely located data centers (e. g., cloudlet) overcomes these issues. However, in emergency case (e. g., blackout) con-ventional offloading concepts are no longer available while battery life of mobile devices becomes crucial. In this paper, we extend our previous concept of upgrading wireless home routers as cloudlets by an emergency power extension (i. e., off-the-shelf battery pack) to provide computing infrastructure during an emergency case.
