25|$|The breast is an {{apocrine gland}} that {{produces}} the milk used to feed an infant. The nipple of the breast is surrounded by the areola (nipple-areola complex). The areola has many sebaceous glands, and the skin color varies from pink to dark brown. The basic units of the breast are the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs), which produce the fatty breast milk. They give the breast its offspring-feeding functions as a mammary gland. They are distributed throughout {{the body of the}} breast. Approximately two-thirds of the lactiferous tissue is within 30mm of the base of the nipple. The terminal lactiferous ducts drain the milk from TDLUs into 4–18 lactiferous ducts, which drain to the nipple. The milk-glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in a <b>lactating</b> <b>woman,</b> and 1:1 in a non-lactating woman. In addition to the milk glands, the breast is also composed of connective tissues (collagen, elastin), white fat, and the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. Sensation in the breast is provided by the peripheral nervous system innervation by means of the front (anterior) and side (lateral) cutaneous branches of the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth intercostal nerves. The T-4 nerve (Thoracic spinal nerve 4), which innervates the dermatomic area, supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Lactation {{has been}} {{associated}} with attenuated hormonal responses to exercise stress in humans. This study was designed to determine the effect of lactation on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, autonomic nervous system, and anxiety responses to psychological stress. Method: The Trier Social Stress Test was administered to 24 <b>lactating</b> <b>women,</b> 13 postpartum nonlactating women, and 14 healthy control women in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. <b>Lactating</b> <b>women</b> were stressed at least 40 minutes after last feeding their infant. Results: ACTH, cortisol, heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and subjective anxiety ratings were all significantly increased in response to the psychological stress (all p. 0001). There were no differences among the three groups in any of these responses to the stress. However, postpartum nonlactating women did have a persistently higher systolic blood pressure and lower cardiac vagal tone than the <b>lactating</b> <b>women</b> and control subjects. In addition, the typical negative correlation between cardiac vagal tone and heart rate was consistently higher in <b>lactating</b> <b>women</b> than nonlactating postpartum women and controls, which suggests stronger vagal control of heart rate in <b>lactating</b> <b>women.</b> In addition, there was no change in oxytocin or allopregnanolone in response to the stress, and baseline oxytocin and allopregnanolone levels did not differ among the three groups.

40|$|Background & Objective: Pregnant or <b>lactating</b> <b>women</b> and {{children}} are the two population group most vulnerable to nutritional deficiencies. The {{aim of this study}} was to review the nutritional status of <b>lactating</b> <b>women,</b> as one of the main loops of the chain of effective factors on health of the generation and society, assessing the supportive nutrition programs in Iran and to provide solutions in this regard. Method: This review was conducted in April 2014. All related articles on the databases of IranMedex, SID (Scientific Information database) and PubMed were investigated with no time limit. After reviewing the abstracts, 15 Persian articles and 13 English articles were fully reviewed. Results: The results of the few available studies on the nutritional status of <b>lactating</b> <b>women</b> indicate deficiencies or inappropriate nutritional patterns among <b>lactating</b> <b>women.</b> Although in formulation of nutritional strategies, pregnant or <b>lactating</b> <b>women</b> {{and children}} often receive equal attention, women are practically the target of nutrition and health programs to improve the growth of the fetus and little attention have been paid to their health and nutritional needs.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about how <b>lactating</b> <b>women</b> {{accommodate}} for their increased glucose demands during fasting to avoid maternal hypoglycemia. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether <b>lactating</b> <b>women</b> conserve plasma glucose by reducing maternal glucose utilization by increasing utilization of FFA and ketone bodies and/or increasing gluconeogenesis and mammary gland hexoneogenesis. Six healthy exclusively breastfeeding women and six nonlactating controls were studied during 42 h of fasting and 6 h of refeeding. Glucose and protein kinetic parameters were measured using stable isotopes and GCMS and energy expenditure and substrate oxidation using indirect calorimetry. After 42 h of fasting, milk production decreased by 16 % but remained within normal range. Glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations decreased with the duration of fasting in both groups but were lower (P < 0. 05) in <b>lactating</b> <b>women.</b> Glucagon, FFA, and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations increased with fasting time (P < 0. 001) and were higher (P < 0. 0001) in <b>lactating</b> <b>women</b> during both fasting and refeeding. During 42 h of fasting, gluconeogenesis was higher in <b>lactating</b> <b>women</b> compared with nonlactating controls (7. 7 ± 0. 4 vs. 6. 5 ± 0. 2 μmol·kg− 1 ·min− 1, P < 0. 05), whereas glycogenolysis was suppressed to similar values (0. 4 ± 0. 1 vs. 0. 9 ± 0. 2 μmol·kg− 1 ·min− 1, respectively). Mammary hexoneogenesis did not increase with the duration of fasting. Carbohydrate oxidation was lower and fat and protein oxidations higher (P < 0. 05) in <b>lactating</b> <b>women.</b> In summary, <b>lactating</b> <b>women</b> are at risk for hypoglycemia if fasting is extended beyond 30 h. The extra glucose demands of extended fasting during lactation appear to be compensated by increasing gluconeogenesis associated with ketosis, decreasing carbohydrate oxidation, and increasing protein and FFA oxidations...|$|R

Mean thyroxin {{concentrations in the}} <b>lactating</b> and nonlactating <b>women</b> were significantly (P 0. 2) in trilodothyronine concentration among these three groups. Free T 4 concentration was significantly (P < 0. 01) lower in <b>lactating</b> <b>women</b> than in controls. The reverse-T 3 concentrations in both <b>lactating</b> and nonlactating <b>women</b> were significantly (P < 0. 001) lower than in controls, and were significantly (P < 0. 001) lower in lactating than in nonlactating women. The concentration of thyroxin-binding globulin was significantly higher in <b>lactating</b> <b>women</b> than i...|$|R
