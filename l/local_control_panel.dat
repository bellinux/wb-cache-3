40|$|This bachelor’s {{thesis is}} a part of the {{research}} project realized in the summer 2011 in Lappeenranta University of Technology. The goal of the project was to develop an automation concept for controlling the electrically excited synchronous motor. Thesis concentrates on the implementation of the automation concept into the ABB’s AC 500 programmable logic enviroment. The automation program was developed as a state machine with the ABB’s PS 501 Control Builder software. For controlling the automation program is developed a fieldbus control and with CodeSys Visualization Tool a <b>local</b> <b>control</b> with <b>control</b> <b>panel.</b> The fieldbus <b>control</b> is done to correspond the ABB drives communication profile and the <b>local</b> <b>control</b> is implemented with a function block which feeds right control words into the statemachine.

40|$|Recently the {{technological}} linear electron accelerators such as: LU- 10, KYT, LIK, EPOS {{with the energy}} up to 8 and 30 MeV and the pulse current up to 1 A have been developed and put into operation in the Scientific Research Complex (SRC) "Accelerator " of the National Science Center, Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology (KIPT). These linacs equipped with control systems which allows to control electrons energy on the exit of the linacs. 1 CONTROL SYSTEMS The special control system [2] has also been developed for controlling the electron beam current [3], energy [4] and position {{as well as the}} control of parameters and defense of the accelerating and scanning systems from the damage caused by the beam; blocking of the modulator and klystron amplifier {{in the case of the}} intolerable operation regimes; current control in the magnetic system; regulation of the phase and power of the HF signals in the injecting system; the radiation dose control and control of the target devices. The program & technical complex consists of PC equipped with CAMAC crate (fig. 1) or measuring channels in PC standard (fig. 2), multiplexer (MP), synchronization unit (S), microprocessor-operated complexes (MC) to monitor the klystron amplifier operation, the thermostating system (t°C), the target equipment (TE), and control units of magnet power supplies (MPS). Fig. 1. Functional scheme of the KYT accelerator control system The measuring devices provide receiving the signal from the analog to digital converters (ADC) probes with the 50 or 100 nsec discreteness by two (fig. 3) or four (fig. 4) commutating channels simultaneously. The CSL software packet allows the control system to operate in both automatic and manual regimes. The information of the accelerator systems state and the beam parameters is displayed on the local unit terminals and on the color graphics display (D) in the form of the triple-screen <b>control</b> <b>panel.</b> The operator can monitor the work of the accelerator from the PC keyboard and from the <b>local</b> <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> (CP).

40|$|This poster {{presentation}} describes the Optical Attenuation Mechanism (OAM) Upgrades to the MOBLAS and TLRS Crustal Dynamics Satellite Laser Ranging (CDSLR) systems. The upgrades {{were for the}} purposes of preparing these systems to laser range to the TOPEX/POSEIDON spacecraft when it will be launched in the summer of 1992. The OAM permits the laser receiver to operate over the expected large signal dynamic range from TOPEX/POSEIDON and it reduces the number of pre- and post-calibrations for each satellite during multi-satellite tracking operations. It further simplifies the calibration bias corrections that had been made due to the pass-to-pass variation of the photomultiplier supply voltage and the transmit filter glass thickness. The upgrade incorporated improvements to the optical alignment capability of each CDSLR system through the addition of a CCD camera into the MOBLAS receive telescope and an alignment telescope onto the TLRS optical table. The OAM is stepper motor and microprocessor based; and the system can be controlled either manually by a <b>control</b> switch <b>panel</b> or computer <b>controlled</b> via an EIA RS- 232 C serial interface. The OAM has a neutral density (ND) range of 0. 0 to 4. 0 and the positioning is absolute referenced in steps of 0. 1 ND. Both the fixed transmit filter and the daylight filter are solenoid actuated with digital inputs and outputs to and from the OAM microprocessor. During automated operation, the operator has the option to overide the remote control and control the OAM system via a <b>local</b> <b>control</b> switch <b>panel...</b>|$|R
