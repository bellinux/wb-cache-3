Various activities to maintain the service life of already operated mining equipment are implemented. In this regard, the urgent issue {{is the problem of}} efficient distribution of available machines in different geological conditions. The problem of “excavator-automobile” complex effective distribution occurs when heavy dump trucks are used in mining. For this reason, excavation and transportation of blasted rock mass are the most labor intensive and costly processes, considering the volume of transported overburden and coal, as well as diesel fuel, electricity, fuel and lubricants costs, consumables for repair works and downtime, etc. Currently, it is recommended to take the number of <b>loading</b> <b>buckets</b> in the range of 3 to 5, according to which the dump trucks are distributed to faces...|$|R
50|$|The dredge floats in an {{artificial}} pond often supplied {{with water from}} an outside source. It digs at the bow and deposits washed tailings at the stern, thus carrying the pond with it as it advances. The digging end comprises an endless chain of cast manganese steel buckets carried on a fabricated steel ladder at an angle of approximately 45 degrees when operating at maximum depth. The ladder carries a circular tumbler at its lower end {{and a series of}} rollers on its upper side to support the <b>loaded</b> <b>buckets.</b> The top, or driving, tumbler is normally hexagonal in shape and is driven by electric motors mounted {{on either side of the}} ladder. The size of a dredge is designated by the capacity of its individual bucket which can be up to 20 cubic feet but, in the case of the Nettle Creek dredge is 12 cubic feet.|$|R

30|$|Azar et al. 1994 observed, that by {{allowing}} more possible destinations for items and choosing that destination with lowest load, both, the average {{as well as}} the upper bound load, can be reduced exponentially. This effect became popular as the “power of two choices”, a term coined by Mitzenmacher in (Mitzenmacher 1996). Vöcking 2003 achieved further improvements by introducing the “always-go-left” algorithm, where the items are distributed asymmetrically among the buckets. Broder and Mitzenmacher 2001 suggest using multiple hash functions to improve the performance of hash tables. The n buckets of the table are split into d equal parts imagined to run from left to right. An item is hashed d times to find the d possible locations. It is then placed in the least <b>loaded</b> <b>bucket.</b> Ties are broken by going left (d-left hashing). A lookup requires examining the d locations. Since the d choices are independent, lookups can be performed in parallel or pipelined. A survey of multiple-choice hashing schemes and their applications can be found in (Mitzenmacher 2001 a).|$|R
30|$|Summary. The results fully {{meet the}} {{expectations}} and backup our theoretical analysis. We {{have shown that}} our initial assumptions allow fundamental improvements over previous suggestions. Experiments {{have shown that the}} EHT performs as theoretically expected. This makes the EHT highly predictable and allows easy configuration for target applications. The effects of parameters on counter distribution, <b>bucket</b> <b>load,</b> counter and <b>bucket</b> overflows can easily be predicted. Evaluation shows, which hardware configurations are required for specific parameter sets. The effect of Huffman compression is much harder to predict, since all possible combinations of counter values per word would need to be predicted which is impractical. However, evaluation shows the effect of Huffman compression compared to no compression and simple word-based encoding.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, commercial part selections, fabrication, assembly, installation, and initial {{operation of a}} two degree of freedom robotic excavator. Colloquially referred to as "the NASA Glenn Digger," it was designed specifically to be mounted onto, and to operate with, the then newly developed Centaur 2 robotic mobility base. The excavator, when mounted to Centaur 2, is designed to scoop loose regolith from the terrain, raise its <b>loaded</b> <b>bucket</b> up and dump the load into a hopper {{of at least a}} 1 -m-height. The hopper represents the input to a machine that would process the raw material, such as to produce oxygen from lunar regolith as would be required for long-term lunar habitation. This equipment debuted at the annual Research and Technology Studies ("Desert RATS", Ref. 1) event held north of Flagstaff, Arizona, in September of 2010, when the Digger was successfully joined to Centaur 2 and the shoveling articulation was demonstrated. During 2011, the hardware was modified for added strength, strain gauges were added to measure loads, and the controls were improved in preparation for the 2011 Desert RATS event, where additional "field operations" experience was gained...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of this work is the demonstration of feasibility of computerized optimal tuning of electronic motion controllers for mobile heavy equipment end-effectors. A backhoe yaw mode position control system {{was selected as the}} application for the purpose of proof of concept. The control algorithm selected for use in the servocontroller is Pseudo-Derivative Feedback (PDF). A computer model and an opera-tional laboratory model of a translational electrohydraulic position control system dynamically analogous to the structural, mechanical, and hydraulic components of the selected backhoe position control system were con- 0 -structed. These models were exercised in simulation of the backhoe sys-tem equipped with an electronic servocontroller incorporating the PDF 00 -algorithm. The computer model was first validated in its baseline con-figuration by way of comparison with baseline laboratory model test re-suits. "Baseline " refers to the complete system, but with proportional m position feedback control in place of the PDF algorithm. An interesting aspect of this project is the two degree-of-freedom system constituted by the relatively compliant boom, coupling the hydraulic actuator with a fully <b>loaded</b> <b>bucket.</b> This is of particular interest since the bucket does not lend itself to position instrumentation, thereby precluding load position feed-back. Data supporting the successful demonstration of computerized auto-mation of optimal tuning is presented...|$|R
40|$|Laser class sailors have to hike out, i. e. hook {{their feet}} under the toe straps near the {{centreline}} {{of the boat}} and hold their upper bodies {{over the edge of the}} boat, to counteract the heeling forces generated by the sails. To identify the parameters that are associated with maximal hiking performance, this cross-sectional observational study measures various knee extensor and hip flexor muscle performance characteristics in 55 Laser sailors and correlates each with the area-under-the-curve hiking moment over 3 min of hiking on a hiking dynamometer (HM 180). Our results showed that higher body mass and HM 180 were significantly associated with better race scores (Spearman&# 039;s rho = - 0. 69 and - 0. 62, respectively, both P or = 0. 95, P or = 0. 80, P or = 0. 80, P < 0. 01 in both males and females) were associated with a higher HM 180. The correlations between height, abdominal muscle endurance (crunches), explosive lower body strength (vertical jumps), cycling time-to-exhaustion, quadriceps strength endurance, or isometric quadriceps endurance with incremental <b>loads</b> (<b>bucket</b> test), and HM 180 were weaker (r < 0. 60). HM 180 may be a useful performance indicator for Laser racing. Since strength measures correlated well with HM 180, greater emphasis should be placed on developing maximum strength in the quadriceps to improve maximal hiking performance...|$|R
30|$|A {{hash table}} bucket usually holds a single entry or a {{reference}} to a collection of entries. If more than one entry is placed in a bucket, lookup might require multiple memory reads by following pointers.

30|$|We first {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} the EHT with respect to lookups. To achieve deterministic lookup performance, it is crucial that counter value distribution and <b>bucket</b> <b>loads</b> behave as expected. Counter distribution affects the maximum allowed counter value, which in turn affects the effectiveness of summary compression and the number of entries that have to be moved to CAM due to counter overflows.|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} present-day {{functionality}} of large-scale sublevel caving (SLC) at LKAB Kiruna a comprehensive measurement program was undertaken involving blast function, fragmentation and gravity flow. As {{part of this}} assessment, a fragmentation measurement trial was performed based on 3 D imaging ofthe draw-point and corresponding <b>bucket</b> <b>load</b> of the underground load-haul-dump (LHD) excavator. 3 D image data from stereo photogrammetry was collected and an automated image analysis strategy developed. A number of data sets were collected {{for each of the}} draw-point and LHD bucket, along withsieving results for four of the LHD <b>bucket</b> <b>loads</b> (totally about 70 tonnes). Two of the sieving results were used to inform the automated image analysis strategy, and two were held back as a comparison. Large variations in the visible particles are apparent when comparing corresponding draw-points and LHD bucketshighlighting the impact of sampling location and the need to measure large quantities of data in order to avoid bias from small samples. The results show that 3 D imaging and analysis can produce fully automated measurement and analysis of the visible particle size distribution.
