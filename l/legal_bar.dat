5|$|Warwick's sister, and {{therefore}} Edward IV's niece, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, was executed by Henry VIII in 1541. By then, {{the cause was}} more religious and political rather than dynastic. The attainder of her father, Clarence, was a <b>legal</b> <b>bar</b> to any claims to the throne by his children. Additionally her marriage, arranged by Henry VII, to Sir Richard Pole, his half-cousin and trusted supporter, was not auspicious. Nevertheless, it did allow the couple to be closely involved in court affairs. Margaret's fortunes improved under Henry VIII and in February 1512 she was restored to the earldom of Salisbury and all the Warwicks' lands. This made her the first and, apart from Anne Boleyn, {{the only woman in}} 16th-century England to hold a peerage title in her own right.|$|E
5|$|The chief tax {{imposed by}} Charles was a feudal levy known as ship money, which proved even more unpopular, and lucrative, than {{poundage}} and tonnage before it. Previously, collection of ship money had been authorised only during wars, and only on coastal regions. Charles, however, {{argued that there}} was no <b>legal</b> <b>bar</b> to collecting the tax for defence during peacetime and throughout the whole of the kingdom. Ship money, paid directly to the Treasury of the Navy, provided between £150,000 to £200,000 annually between 1634 and 1638, after which yields declined. Opposition to ship money steadily grew, but the 12 common law judges of England declared that the tax was within the king's prerogative, though some of them had reservations. The prosecution of John Hampden for non-payment in 1637–38 provided a platform for popular protest, and the judges only found against Hampden by the narrow margin of 7–5.|$|E

5000|$|A third {{challenge}} to UCL's claim {{is that it}} did not receive degree awarding powers until 27 September 2005, although it was included in the Education (Recognised Bodies) Order 1997 as one of the [...] "Schools, Colleges and Institutes of the University of London permitted by the University to award University of London degrees". The first UCL degrees were awarded in summer 2008. This is one of the Vaisey criteria for being recognised as a de facto university (see above), so failing to have degree awarding powers could be seen as weakening UCL's case for recognition as a de facto university. However, it has also been claimed {{that at the time of}} UCL's foundation there may have been no <b>legal</b> <b>bar</b> to any institute awarding whatever degrees it liked, such as the [...] "Diploma of Master of Medicine and Surgery in the University of London" [...] (M. Med. et Chir. U. L.) advertised in UCL's 1832 calendar. When Brougham (then Lord Chancellor) asked in the Privy Council in 1834, [...] "Pray, Mr. Bickersteth, what is to prevent the London University granting degrees now?" [...] he received the reply: [...] "The universal scorn and contempt of mankind." [...] Contrary to this view, a case was brought before the House of Lords in 1745 regarding the power of Marischal College in Aberdeen to grant degrees, implying that this was regarded as an activity regulated by law. It was also disputed in the 1830s whether degree awarding powers were an essential part of being a university or not (see discussion under Durham below).|$|E

40|$|Most {{studies on}} {{consanguinity}} {{have been conducted}} on contemporary populations and {{have focused on the}} prevalence and types of preferred intra-familial marriage. With its comprehensive birth, marriage and deaths records dating back to the late 17 th century, and the <b>legal</b> <b>bar</b> on first cousin marriage removed in the mid- 19 th century, Sweden offers unique opportunities to examine the factors that determine by whom, where and why consanguineous marriages were contracted. The present study covers the period 1780 - 1899 and presents a detailed portrait of cousin and sibling exchange marriages in the Skellefteå region of northern coastal Sweden. The combined prevalence of first, second and third cousin marriage increased from 2. 3 % in 1790 - 1810 to 8. 8 % in 1880 - 1899, and multi-generation consanguinity also increased significantly over the study period. The distribution and prevalence of first cousin marriages was strikingly non-random, with a significantly greater propensity for consanguinity among land-owning families, especially involving first-born sons, within specific pedigrees, and in a number of more remote inland communities. Additional factors associated with a greater likelihood of consanguineous marriage included physical or mental disability among males, and among females the prior birth of an illegitimate child. Besides the inherent interest in the social and demographic structure of this region of northern Sweden {{during the course of the}} 19 th century, in future studies it will be important to determine the degree to which the observed patterns of consanguineous and sibling exchange marriages in these past generations could have influenced present-day genetic structure...|$|E
