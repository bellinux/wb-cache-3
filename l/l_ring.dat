40|$|AbstractIn synthesis, {{this paper}} {{presents}} a generalization {{of the theory of}} Morita contexts from the case of abstract modules over abstract rings to that of complete l. t. (linearly topological) modules over complete <b>l.</b> t. <b>rings.</b> To begin with, given three complete right <b>l.</b> t. <b>rings</b> (R,ρ), (S,σ) and (T,τ), and two complete l. t. bimodules (RAS,α) and (SBT,β) satisfying suitable hypotheses, we introduce the “topological tensor product” (A,α) ⊗uS(B,β). Next, we define a topological Morita context to be a family made up of two complete <b>l.</b> t. <b>rings</b> (R,ρ) and (S,σ), two bimodules (SAR,α) and (RBS,β) of the above kind, and two continuous bilinear maps μ:(B,β) ⊗uS(A,α) →(R,ρ) and ν:(A,α) ⊗uR(B,β) →(S,σ); the context is called dense if both μ and ν have dense image. We then prove that such a dense Morita context yields an equivalence of categories between CLT-(R,ρ) and CLT-(S,σ), in such a way to induce an equivalence between Mod-(R,ρ) and Mod-(S,σ). Finally, we give a “topological” parallel of the notion of progenerator, and we show that such a “topological progenerator” gives rise to a dense context, and hence to an equivalence of the above-mentioned kind. Conversely, we show that every such equivalence arises in this way...|$|R
40|$|Among flagellar mutants of Escherichia coli, flaM or flaU mutants form basal bodies {{lacking the}} outer P and L rings, whereas flaY mutants {{predominantly}} form basal bodies lacking the <b>L</b> <b>ring.</b> In these mutants, hooks and filaments are occasionally assembled onto these incomplete basal bodies. When the hook protein gene, flaFV, of Salmonella typhimurium was cloned on the multicopy plasmid pBR 322 and introduced into these mutants, the efficiency with which cells assembled hooks and filaments onto the incomplete basal bodies increased significantly. Such cells formed characteristic dotted swarms on semisolid plates, indicating that cells carrying flagella without the outer rings are weakly motile {{because of poor}} function of their flagella, a low flagellar number per cell, or both of these defects. FlaV mutants also produced incomplete basal bodies lacking the outer rings, but assembly of hooks and filaments did not occur in these mutants even after introduction of the plasmid carrying flaFV of S. typhimurium. The failure {{in the case of}} flaV mutants was attributed to their inability to modify the rod tip to the structure competent for assembly of hook protein...|$|E
40|$|Until now, {{identification}} of {{components of the}} flagellar protein export apparatus has been indirect. We have now identified these components directly by establishing whether mutants defective in putative export components could translocate export substrates across the cytoplasmic membrane into the periplasmic space. Hook-type proteins could be exported to the periplasm of rod mutants, indicating that rod protein export {{does not have to}} precede hook-type protein export and therefore that both types of proteins belong to a single export class, the rod/hook-type class, which is distinct from the filament-type class. Hook-capping protein (FlgD) and hook protein (FlgE) required FlhA, FlhB, FliH, FliI, FliO, FliP, FliQ, and FliR for their export to the periplasm. In the case of flagellin as an export substrate, because of the phenomenon of hook-to-filament switching of export specificity, it was necessary to use temperature-sensitive mutants and establish whether flagellin could be exported to the cell exterior following a shift from the permissive to the restrictive temperature. Again, FlhA, FlhB, FliH, FliI, and FliO were required for its export. No suitable temperature-sensitive fliQ or fliR mutants were available. FliP appeared not to be required for flagellin export, but we suspect that the temperature-sensitive FliP protein continued to function at the restrictive temperature if incorporated at the permissive temperature. Thus, we conclude that these eight proteins are general components of the flagellar export pathway. FliJ was necessary for export of hook-type proteins (FlgD and FlgE); we were unable to test whether FliJ is needed for export of filament-type proteins. We suspect that FliJ may be a cytoplasmic chaperone for the hook-type proteins and possibly also for FliE and the rod proteins. FlgJ was not required for the export of the hook-type proteins; again, because of lack of a suitable temperature-sensitive mutant, we were unable to test whether it was required for export of filament-type proteins. Finally, it was established that there is an interaction between the processes of outer ring assembly and of penetration of the outer membrane by the rod and nascent hook, the latter process being of course necessary for passage of export substrates into the external medium. During the brief transition stage from completion of rod assembly and initiation of hook assembly, the <b>L</b> <b>ring</b> and perhaps the capping protein FlgD can be regarded as bona fide export components, with the <b>L</b> <b>ring</b> being in a formal sense the equivalent of the outer membrane secretin structure of type III virulence factor export systems...|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of sheathed flagella from Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus was investigated. The first three periods of these flagella {{were characterized by}} progressively smaller wavelengths and amplitudes in periods more distal to the cell. The damped appearance was due to a single nonrandom transition between two helical structures within each filament. The intersection of the two helices, {{one of which was}} a threefold-reduced miniature of the other, occurred at a fixed distance along the filament and resulted in a shift in the flagellar axis. Flagella increased in length as the cells aged and assumed a constant miniature waveform at their distal ends. The core filament was the principal determinant of flagellar morphology. It was composed of 28, 000 - and 29, 500 -dalton polypeptides. The 28, 000 -dalton subunits were located in the cell-proximal segment of the filament, and the 29, 500 -dalton subunits were located in the more distal region. The heteromorphous appearance of bdellovibrio flagella arose from the sequential assembly of these subunits. The basal complex associated with core filaments was examined because of its potential involvement in sheath formation.

40|$|The FlgH protein of Salmonella typhimurium, {{from which}} the outer {{membrane}} <b>L</b> <b>ring</b> of the flagellar basal body is constructed, has a consensus motif (LTG C) for lipoylation and signal peptide cleavage. We have confirmed the previous finding (M. Homma, K. Ohnishi, T. Iino, and R. M. Macnab, J. Bacteriol. 169 : 3617 - 3624, 1987) that it is synthesized in precursor form and processed to a mature form with an apparent molecular mass of ca. 25 kDa. flgH alleles with an in-frame deletion or a 3 ' truncation still permitted processing. The deletion permitted partial restoration of motility in complementation tests, whereas the truncation did not. Globomycin, an antibiotic which inhibits signal peptide cleavage of prolipoproteins, caused accumulation of precursor forms of FlgH. When cells transformed with a plasmid containing the flgH gene were grown {{in the presence of}} [3 H]palmitate, a 25 -kDa protein doublet was found to be radiolabeled; its identity as FlgH was confirmed by shifts in mobility when the internally deleted and truncated alleles of the gene were used. Hook-basal body complexes from cells grown in the presence of [3 H]palmitate demonstrated that FlgH incorporated into flagellar structure was also labeled. An in-frame fusion between the leader sequence of the periplasmic protein PeIB and the mature FlgH sequence, with the putative N-terminal cysteine replaced by glycine, resulted in production of a fusion protein that was processed to its mature form. With a low-copy-number plasmid, the ability of this pelB-flgH fusion to complement a flgH mutant was poor, but with a high-copy-number plasmid, it was comparable to that of the wild type. Although lacking the N-terminal cysteine and therefore being incapable of lipoylation via a thioether linkage, the mutant protein still incorporated [3 H]palmitate at low levels, perhaps through acylation of the N-terminal alpha-amino group. We conclude that FlgH is a lipoprotein and that under normal physiological conditions the lipoyl modification is necessary for FlgH to function properly as the L-ring protein of the flagellar basal body. We suggest that the N terminus of FlgH is responsible for anchoring the basal body in the outer membrane and that the C terminus may be responsible for binding to the P ring to form the L,P-ring complex...|$|E
