50|$|Though {{the cars}} are fitted with K-1 and K-2 triple valves with {{retainers}}, the retainers are always set for the full release position. Brake pipe pressure is set to 70 lbs. fully charged and controlling speed with needed reductions as the grade and load require. The light weight of the cars is accentuated when the train is full vs. empty, making {{a big difference in}} how the engineer will handle the train on the return. While riding the train, you will likely hear the hiss of air being released from the brake cylinders as the train goes into the long horseshoe curve, where the grade is flat enough to maintain speed and recharge the brake pipe at the same time. As the engine nears the end of the curve, another set is generally made progressively and will be maintained until the Thunderhead Gap bridge, where the process is repeated and the final application is made for the descent into the <b>lower</b> <b>loop.</b> Once on the <b>lower</b> <b>loop,</b> the train drifts past the engine house and pulls the light grade back into the station.|$|E

When the desired length is reached, the lucet can be cast off by {{carefully}} lifting the loops off the prongs, passing the remaining thread through them and pulling the knot tight.

In preparation for Disneyland's 50th anniversary celebration, the Happiest Homecoming on Earth, King Arthur Carrousel was closed for extensive renovations and reopened in February 2003. These renovations included an entirely rebuilt turntable platform, a new computerized operating console and system which halts the carousel each time at the same spot, removal of a row of four horses to accommodate a four-course-wide bench and wheelchair clamps with an access ramp for ADA compliance, which reduced the count of horses to 68.

Öpir was active in the Uppland region during the late eleventh or early twelfth centuries. The inscription is classified as being in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as the Urnes style.

40|$|The R*-operation by Chetyrkin, Tkachov, and Smirnov is a {{generalisation}} of the BPHZ R-operation, which subtracts both ultraviolet {{and infrared}} divergences of euclidean Feynman graphs with non-exceptional external momenta. It {{can be used}} to compute the divergent parts of such Feynman graphs from products of simpler Feynman graphs of <b>lower</b> <b>loops.</b> In this paper we extend the R*-operation to Feynman graphs with arbitrary numerators, including tensors. We also provide a novel way of defining infrared counterterms which closely resembles the definition of its ultraviolet counterpart. We further express both infrared and ultraviolet counterterms in terms of scaleless vacuum graphs with a logarithmic degree of divergence. By exploiting symmetries, integrand and integral relations, which the counterterms of scaleless vacuum graphs satisfy, we can vastly reduce their number and complexity. A FORM implementation of this method was used to compute the five loop beta function in QCD for a general gauge group. To illustrate the procedure, we compute the poles in the dimensional regulator of all top-level propagator graphs at five loops in four dimensional phi^ 3 theory.

40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: {{perspective}} constructions of the levitation assembly with the vertically arrenged superconducting crew magnets and the route short-circuit coils. The {{purpose of the}} work: the comparative analysis of the levitation assembly versions with one- and two-loop route coils {{from the point of}} view of energetic efficiency of generating the hoisting effort. The problem of comparison of the levitation assemblies with the different versions of the route portion has been solved in the optimization statement supposing the functional but not parametric generality of the versions to be compared. The characteristics of the levitation assembly with two-loop route coils in the form of digit " 8 " have been improved due to the asymmetrization of sizes of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>loops.</b> The original methods of physical modeling of currents in the route coils with the crew speeds essentially exceeding the actual speed obtained in the experiment have been developed. Developed and introduced in practice of the design works of the organisation dealing with the creation of the HSGT, has been the package of the applied programs for solving the multicriterial optimization problems. The requirements to the geometrical sizes and magnetomotive power of the superconducting magnets as well as to the characteristics of the linear tractive electric drive of the HSGT crew have been grounded.
