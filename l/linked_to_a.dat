5|$|In living organisms, DNA {{does not}} usually {{exist as a}} single molecule, but instead {{as a pair of}} {{molecules}} that are held tightly together. These two long strands entwine like vines, {{in the shape of a}} double helix. The nucleotide contains both a segment of the backbone of the molecule (which holds the chain together) and a nucleobase (which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix). A nucleobase <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sugar is called a nucleoside and a base <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide. A polymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) is called a polynucleotide.|$|E

5|$|Adolf Hitler's {{sexuality}} {{has long}} been a matter of historical and scholarly debate. There is evidence that he had romantic encounters with a number of women during his lifetime, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence of homosexual encounters. His name has been <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of possible female lovers, two of whom committed suicide. Another died of complications eight years after a suicide attempt, and one made a failed suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|Although Leng {{credits the}} song's two {{acoustic}} guitar parts to Harrison alone, Spizer suggests that guitarist Peter Frampton may have supplied {{one of these}} parts. Playing the bass, as he did on most of All Things Must Pass, was Klaus Voormann, who would be another to find sanctuary at Friar Park. Harrison offered him refuge from the media in March and April 1971, when reports had Voormann <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> supposed Beatles offshoot band, along with Harrison, Starr and John Lennon.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{studied by}} Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute researchers {{off the island}} of Sardinia show random social behavior while feeding, and their social behavior {{does not depend on}} feeding activity. In Sardinia, the presence of a floating marine fin-fish farm has been <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> change in bottlenose dolphin distribution as a result of high fish density around the floating cages in the farming area.|$|E

5|$|Bulk cargo {{can be very}} dense, corrosive, or abrasive. This {{can present}} safety problems: cargo shifting, {{spontaneous}} combustion, and cargo saturation can threaten a ship. The use of ships that are old and have corrosion problems has been <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> spate of bulker sinkings in the 1990s, as have the bulker's large hatchways, important for efficient cargo handling. New international regulations have since been introduced to improve ship design and inspection, and to streamline the process of abandoning ship.|$|E

5|$|In either 549 or 550, the Gepids and Lombards again marched {{against each}} other but, {{according}} to Procopius, both armies panicked and no battle took place. As a result, a new war was avoided and Thurisind accepted Audoin's request for a two-year truce. According to István Boná, the panic may be <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> natural phenomenon: a lunar eclipse took place on June 25/26, 549.|$|E

Mortal Kombat uses {{a single}} two-dimensional fighting plane (at 60 frames per second), although characters are rendered in three-dimensional fashion, {{intended to give}} depth and range to portrayals of various projectiles.

This eliminates business registration fraud through the exposure of false identities and prevents multiple registrations of businesses for fraudulent purposes.|$|E

5|$|Religious {{views of}} {{conscience}} usually {{see it as}} <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> morality inherent in all humans, to a beneficent universe and/or to divinity. The diverse ritualistic, mythical, doctrinal, legal, institutional and material features of religion may not necessarily cohere with experiential, emotive, spiritual or contemplative considerations about the origin and operation of conscience. Common secular or scientific views regard the capacity for conscience as probably genetically determined, with its subject probably learned or imprinted (like language) {{as part of a}} culture.|$|E
