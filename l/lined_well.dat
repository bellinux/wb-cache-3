5000|$|The William and Mary (Messersmith) Seerley Barn and Milkhouse-Smokehouse are {{historic}} buildings {{located on a}} farm southwest of Earlham, Iowa, United States. The Seerleys moved from Indiana and settled on their 200 acre farm in 1856, and built a log cabin {{the same year as}} their residence. They built a permanent home in 1861, and around the same time the combination milkhouse and smokehouse was built. The barn followed around 1876. These two buildings are early examples of well preserved agricultural building. [...] The two rooms of the milkhouse-smokehouse sit at right angels from each other. The single-story structure is composed of finished cut rubble. It features a stone <b>lined</b> <b>well,</b> water troughs that cooled and stored dairy products, the smokehouse, and a covered outdoor work area where food was processed and laundry. The Sweitzer Pennsylvania barn is composed of native limestone on the lower level, and a heavy timber haymow with forebay on the upper level.

40|$|An archaeological survey at {{the site}} of a {{proposed}} water treatment plant was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on January 13, 2016 for the city of Bruceville-Eddy in McLennan and Falls counties, Texas. The project area consisted of two miles of highway right-of-way and a tract of land 103 acres in size. The soil throughout the 103 acre tract consists of firm black and brown clay at or near the surface (see Environmental Setting for description of soil). In some areas, marl was present at depths of 30 cm or less. No evidence of a prehistoric site was found. Two historic sites were recorded. These include a farmstead (41 ML 309) that consists of a collapsed house, a pole barn, brick <b>lined</b> <b>well,</b> and storm cellar. Other minor outbuildings were observed in other areas at least 40 m distant. The second historic site (41 ML 310) is a wooden house that had been added onto at one time.

40|$|Development {{projects}} in the Third World gain much from having been built upon methods which have their roots embedded in the traditional culture. Such practices evolve because they are simple, logical and bring a tangible and valuable end result to daily life. Some techniques may have been borrowed from elsewhere {{in the past and}} been adapted over time to suit local conditions. Methods which fall short of the basic ideals usually fade away in time. Those that make good sense are retained. Throughout the world there are many examples. One good Zimbabwean example is linked to rural water supplies- the upgraded family well. This technique evolved from a simple water hole into a unit which now combines a <b>lined</b> <b>well</b> chamber, hygienic well head and an adapted miners ’ windlass to form a long lasting and sustainable solution for providing water of improved quality in the rural areas. Yet a knowledge and acceptance of this elegant technique took years to materialise in the minds of policy makers. It was cast aside as being just too simple to warrant attention. There were endless debates on water quality and safety. And yet in time it has been accepted by officialdom and now forms the basis of a National Family Well Upgrading Programme, which currently serves about half a million people in Zimbabwe. Whilst water quality falls short of that delivered from sealed wells fitted with a hand pump, such upgraded wells pose no known health threat and they are infinitely more reliable. Also they provide water close at hand which can also be used, not only for domestic purposes but also for providing food and for earning a living- in the vegetable garden. The method also blends in with traditional life. All that was required was a little tidying up and an appreciation of its elegance by those who were {{in a position to make}} its true value well known. A traditional method of recycling I intend to use just one example of a traditional African method of recycling human waste to establish the same principle. It is the method of planting valuable trees in old abandoned latrine pits- a method which is established in countries as wide apar...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} involves {{two different}} studies. The first concerns the real-time detection of microbial contamination {{in drinking water}} using intrinsic fluorescence of the microorganisms. The prototype, “Blinky”, uses LEDs that emit light at 365 nm, 590 nm, and 635 nm for ultraviolet, amber, and red light, respectively. At 365 nm, the cellular components excited include reduced pyridine nucleotides (RPNs), flavins, and cytochromes to distinguish viable bacteria; at 590 nm, the cellular components excited include cytochromes for non-viable bacteria; at 635 nm, the cellular components excited include calcium dipicolinic acid (DPA) for spores. By using these three different wavelengths, the prototype can differentiate between viable and non-viable organisms and also {{has the potential to}} detect spores. The aim {{of this study was to}} improve the detection limit by modifying the design of the instrument and to establish the detection limit of viable and non-viable bacteria and spores. The instrument was modified by replacing existing LEDs with LEDs that had 50 % more intensity. Two additional LEDs were added for amber and red light, bringing the total to four LEDs for each. The LEDs were also positioned closer to the photomultiplier tube so as to increase sensitivity. For UV, only two LEDs were used as previous. The detection limit of the viable bacteria was ~ 50 live bacteria/L. No change in the intrinsic fluorescence below the concentration of ~ 10 ⁸ dead bacteria/L was observed. The results for spore measurements suggested that most of the spores had germinated before or during the measurements and could not be detected. The instrument was successful in detection of viable bacteria and also differentiating viable and non-viable bacteria. The instrument was not successful in detection of spores. The second study was designed to assess the water quality of well construction in southeastern Tanzania. Three designs were tested: Msabi rope pump (lined borehole and covered), an open well converted into a closed well (uncovered well into a covered and <b>lined</b> <b>well),</b> and an open well (uncovered and may or may not be lined). The study looked at the microbial and chemical water quality, as well as turbidity. The survey included 97 water collection points, 94 wells and three rivers. For microbial analysis, heterotrophic plate count (HPC), total coliforms and E. coli tests were performed. Fifteen of these wells were further analyzed for microflora and diversity for wells comparison purposes, using culture methods, followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genome sequencing. Ten wells out of the fifteen were analyzed for calcium (water hardiness), potassium, nitrates, nitrites, chloride, fluoride, bromide, sulfate, iron, and arsenic. Two water collection points were also selected for organic compound analysis (gasoline components). All samples tested positive for coliforms. Two samples tested positive for Escherichia coli for the lined borehole (Msabi rope pump) and four samples from closed wells. All open wells tested positive for E. coli. There was more microbial diversity in open wells than the closed wells and Msabi rope pumps. Potential bacterial pathogens were detected in seven wells out of the fifteen examined. The wells that tested positive were one Msabi rope pump, one closed well; the rest were from open water sources. Open wells had high turbidity followed by closed wells. Msabi rope pumps had low turbidity comparing to the two wells designs. No traces of gasoline components were detected in any of the water sources. One well out of ten had high amounts of nitrates-nitrogen (> 10 mg/L). The results of this study showed that the Msabi rope pumps performed comparably to the closed wells in terms of microbial quality but performed better with regard to turbidity. The open wells performed poorly in terms of microbial water quality as well and turbidity. There was a statistical difference in HPC, total coliforms, E. coli numbers and turbidity between open wells, closed wells and the Msabi rope pumps. However, there was no statistical difference in HPC, total coliforms and E. coli numbers between the closed wells and Msabi rope pumps. Msabi rope pumps performed better in turbidit...|$|E
