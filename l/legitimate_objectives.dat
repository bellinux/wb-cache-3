For example, in Roebuck v NUM (Yorkshire Area) No 2 Templeman J held that it was unfair that Arthur Scargill was on the appeal panel for journalists being disciplined for appearing as witnesses against a libel action by Scargill himself. In another example, Esterman v NALGO held that Miss Esterman could not be disciplined for taking up an election counting job outside of her work, especially since {{the power of the}} union to restrain her was not clearly in its own rules. Fifth, members cannot be expelled from the union without a fair reason, set out in the statutory grounds under TULRCA 1992 section 174. This could include an expulsion under the Bridlington Principles, an agreement among unions to maintain solidarity and not attempt to [...] "poach" [...] each other's members. However, the legislation was amended after ASLEF v United Kingdom to make clear that unions may exclude members whose beliefs or actions are opposed to the union's <b>legitimate</b> <b>objectives.</b> In ASLEF, a member named Mr Lee was involved in the British National Party, a neo-fascist organisation committed to white supremacy, and Lee himself was involved in violence and intimidation against Muslim people and women. The European Court of Human Rights held that ASLEF was entitled to expel Mr Lee because, so long as it did not abuse its organisational power or lead to individual hardship, [...] "unions must remain free to decide in accordance with union rules, questions concerning admission to and expulsion from the union." [...] Lastly, union members also have the more dubious [...] "right" [...] to not strike in accordance with the decision of the executive. This precludes a union disciplining members who break solidarity, and has been criticised by the International Labour Organization for undermining a union's effectiveness, in breach of core labour standards.|$|E

Additionally, the necessity test also includes (4) a comparison with possible alternative measures.

30|$|Pursuant to Art. 2.2 TBT, ‘technical {{regulations}} {{shall not}} be more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil a <b>legitimate</b> <b>objective,</b> taking account of the risks non-fulfilment would create.’ Such risks of not fulfilling the <b>legitimate</b> <b>objective</b> might thus give hints as to {{the necessity of a}} technical regulation. Sentence  4 of Art.  2.2 TBT continues that ‘[i]n assessing such risks, relevant elements of consideration are, inter alia: available scientific and technical information […] or intended end-uses of products’. To determine the risks in case the authorisation scheme’s goals are not fulfilled, the ‘nature of the risks’ to {{human health and the environment}} caused by SVHC have to be examined [21]. Taking into account available scientific and technical information as well as intended end-uses of products, this analysis includes both procedural and substantive considerations as explained in the next two sections. From a procedural point of view an assessment is necessary whether the risk assessment provided for in the extended authorisation requirement is appropriate to determine risks in terms of Art.  2.2 TBT. From a substantive point of view the significance which the TBT Agreement ascribes to these risks needs to be considered.|$|R

50|$|One {{issue that}} the Court {{considered}} was whether a parent's presence makes it permissible {{for the child to}} engage in actions that would otherwise be prohibited. Noting that the dangers would still exist, the Court decided that the state was free to legislate against this activity, even if adults were allowed to engage in them. The opinion noted:The family itself is not beyond regulation in the public interest, as against a claim of religious liberty. And neither the rights of religion nor the rights of parenthood are beyond limitation…. The right to practice religion freely does not include the right to expose the community or the child to communicable disease or the latter to ill-health or death....Parents may be free to become martyrs themselves. But it does not follow they are free, in identical circumstances, to make martyrs of their children before they have reached the age of full and legal discretion when they can make that choice for themselves. Massachusetts has determined that an absolute prohibition, though one limited to streets and public places and to the incidental uses proscribed, is necessary to accomplish its <b>legitimate</b> <b>objectives.</b> Its power to attain them is broad enough to reach these peripheral instances in which the parent's supervision may reduce but cannot eliminate entirely the ill effects of the prohibited conduct. We think that with reference to the public proclaiming of religion, upon the streets and in other similar public places, {{the power of the state}} to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its authority over adults, as is true in the case of other freedoms, and the rightful boundary of its power has not been crossed in this case.|$|E

At the same time REACH enforcement in 18 EEA countries shows very low numbers regarding non-compliance in reference to the authorisation regime de lege lata (three cases of non-compliances in 421 inspections) [25].

5000|$|On the European level, the Council of Europe {{provides}} a legal framework through the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), whose enforcement is assured through the European Court of Human Rights' (ECtHR) jurisdiction. ECHR Article 10 on Freedom of expression says: [...] "1. Everyone {{has the right}} to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.2.The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, {{for the protection of the}} reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary." [...] As observable in the citation, within the ECHR freedom of expression is not recognised as an absolute right, meaning it can be restricted if there are other competing fundamental rights or <b>legitimate</b> <b>objectives</b> necessary for democratic society. These might be data protection, the right to privacy, reputation or criminal justice. However, the restriction needs to be proportional to the achievement of the competing objective and press freedom and needs [...] "very high requirements before any restrictions can be imposed on the freedom of the press by the public authorities." [...] Even if Press freedom takes the function of a democracy guarantor, it does not only protect materials dealing with political issues, but is applied as well to tabloid journalism. However, the more significant a specific journalistic item is to form public opinion, the higher priority needs to be given to press freedom when it is weighed up against other legitimate interests.|$|E

In contrast to traditional, rational and normative approaches to how people should ideally behave (we use behaviour {{as a general}} concept that includes the subcategories judgement and decision making), behavioural sciences give scientific, empirical, evidence-based, and descriptive approaches to how people actually make judgements and decisions. Thus, these two approaches are complementary: the rational agent model prescribes the ideal behaviour, whereas the behavioural model describes the actual behaviour.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, the {{extended}} authorisation requirement’s <b>legitimate</b> <b>objective</b> {{has to be}} taken into account [16, 21] which is to ensure a high level of protection for human health and the environment by reducing the risks of SVHC. The SVHC criteria are an expression of this level of protection, the adoption of which—according to an evolutionary interpretation of Art.  2.2 TBT in the light of the requirements of the precautionary principle—is covered by the regulatory autonomy of the Member States of the Agreement. A non-fulfilment of the normative goals would, therefore, cause unacceptable risks, irrespective of the specific SVHC category. This again underscores the necessity of the scheme [15].|$|R
