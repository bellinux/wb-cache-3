50|$|The {{mechanism}} of barrier cream varies by product. Three categories of barrier creams are used: water repellent creams, water-soluble creams, and creams designed for special applications. Moisturizing barrier cream {{acts as a}} <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> on the skin to prevent depletion of water (transepidermal water loss) in the skin's outermost layer, the stratum corneum. This may have a protective effect against irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis, which often result from such depletion. These barrier creams can be classed as occlusives (which prevent loss through a hydrophobic effect), humectants (which absorb water from the dermis and environment due to hygroscopy), or hydrating agents (which both moisturize the skin and maintain its water content). Barrier creams may contain substances such as zinc oxide, talc or kaolin to layer over the skin. Other barrier creams are intended to protect the skin from some external agents, though they are not sufficient to provide a complete barrier.|$|E

40|$|Radial {{lip seals}} for {{rotating}} shaft {{have been used}} {{for a long time to}} keep lubricant within bearings and air and dust particles outside. How they work is not completely understood. This study examines operation of a plain radial lip seal lubricated with grease and aims at developing a model that explains the lubrication and sealing behaviour of this type of seal. One existing hypothesis how the seals function is the Weissenberg effect hypothesis. The hypothesis state that the lubricant is exposed to extreme shear load, which will contribute to the pumping effect and the maintenance of the <b>lubricated</b> <b>film.</b> An investigation is therefore made to examine if the non Newtonian characteristics of the grease prevents leakage. Comparison between Newtonian and non Newtonian fluid calculated by using the finite element software program COMSOL Multiphysics has been performed. The results show that there are differences between Newtonian and non Newtonian flow. The non Newtonian characteristics contribute to a larger flow in the axial direction as compared to the corresponding Newtonian fluid. This may contribute to a pumping effect and transportation of heat near the minimum film thickness. At the edge of the contact, the non Newtonian fluid becomes more viscous than the Newtonian fluid. The magnitude of the velocity in the pumping direction for the non Newtonian fluid decreases, which may contribute to the maintenance of the <b>lubricated</b> <b>film.</b> Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|Many food {{products}} are highly structured, complex hydrocolloids that {{are characterized by}} either a gel-like or shear thinning behaviour and are thus strongly non-Newtonian systems. Their sensory perception during use is dependent on their behaviour in very thin film conditions at high shear rates. In order to better understand their behaviour in thin films, we have formulated two kinds of solution which are typically present in real systems. We examine the lubricating properties (i. e. tribology) of thin films of structured and non-structured fluids between a hard and soft surface (2 ̆ 7 soft-EHL 2 ̆ 7 lubrication), when the film thickness is of a similar size to the microstructural elements. The present work involves relating the tribology of both shear thinning polymer solutions and swollen microgel suspensions to their theological and microstructural properties in thin films and at high shear rates in the boundary, mixed and fluid film lubrication regimes. We show that the polymer solutions are typically entrained into rubbing contacts to form mixed fluid/boundary <b>lubricating</b> <b>films</b> while model yield stress fluids generate only boundary <b>lubricating</b> <b>films.</b> Soft-EHL theory satisfactorily predicts friction measurements at high entrainment speeds in full film lubrication. The microgels are found to form a confined film which minimizes contact between the surfaces, causing a lowering of the friction coefficient in the boundary-regime, while the friction in the mixed-regime is also dependent on the high-shear viscosity.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is {{turbulent}} flow in a lubricated plane channel. This flow is mainly studied by direct numerical simulations (DNS). Both the <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> and the bulk-fluid velocity and pressure fields are computed within the DNS approach. The very thin <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> is more viscous than the bulk-fluid and is present at both channel walls. The bulk-fluid is no longer exposed to the no-slip condition at the channel walls, and is instead influenced by the dynamic interface between the <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> and the bulk-fluid. Despite the rather large interfacial motions the bulk-flow does in many aspects perceive the interface as a solid wall, except {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> where the interfacial motions heavily influence the bulk-flow. The coherent structures in the near interface region, which are responsible for {{a major part of the}} turbulence production, resemble those close to solid walls. The thin <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> shows a high degree of anisotropy, and the only major component is the streamwise velocity fluctuations. The interface reduces the interaction between the bulk-flow and the solid wall by preventing inrush of high momentum fluid towards the wall. This leads to a reduction of Reynolds shear stress in this region, and inside the film the Reynolds shear stress is vanishing. This observation suggests that a thin <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> can be used for drag reduction purposes. Simulations, using turbulence modelling, show that drag reduction is possible to achieve in high Reynolds number gas-pipelines if the film remains stable. The thin <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> can also be replaced by a set of simplified slip- flow boundary conditions applied at the film bulk-fluid interface. By replacing the <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> with slip-flow conditions, both turbulence statistics as well as the coherent near-interface structures are surprisingly well reproduced. In this approach the need to resolve the flow within the <b>lubricating</b> <b>film</b> is eliminated and the computational efforts are therefore reduced. A direct numerical simulation of a conventional channel flow is also performed. A generic model for the skin-friction pattern associated with the near wall coherent structures is deduced. The generic model of the footprint of the coherent structures shows that high-skin friction occurs just aside of the tip of the vortex tail due to the downwash of high-speed fluid induced by the vortex. Solid spherical particles injected into a turbulent channel flow are studied by DNS. The focus is on the interaction between the particles and the near wall coherent structures. The accumulation of particles in the very near wall region is thought to be an effect of an imbalance between the efficiency of sweeps and ejections in transporting particles. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
