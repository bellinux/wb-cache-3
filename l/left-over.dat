5|$|Matangi {{is often}} {{associated}} with pollution, especially <b>left-over</b> or partially eaten food (Ucchishta or Ucçhishṭa, उच्छिष्ट) considered impure in Hinduism. She is often offered such polluted <b>left-over</b> food and is in one legend described to be born from it. Matangi is herself described as the leftover or residue, symbolizing the Divine Self that is left over after all things perish. As the patron of <b>left-over</b> food offerings, she embodies inauspiciousness and the forbidden transgression of social norms.|$|E
5|$|Matangi {{is often}} {{associated}} with pollution, inauspiciousness and the periphery of Hindu society, which is embodied in her most popular form, known as Ucchishta-Chandalini or Ucchishta-Matangini. She is described as an outcaste (Chandalini) and offered <b>left-over</b> or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) with unwashed hands or food after eating, both of which are considered to be impure in classical Hinduism.|$|E
5|$|Because planetesimals are so numerous, {{and spread}} {{throughout}} the protoplanetary disk, some survive {{the formation of a}} planetary system. Asteroids are understood to be <b>left-over</b> planetesimals, gradually grinding each other down into smaller and smaller bits, while comets are typically planetesimals from the farther reaches of a planetary system. Meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach a planetary surface, and provide {{a great deal of information}} about the formation of the Solar System. Primitive-type meteorites are chunks of shattered low-mass planetesimals, where no thermal differentiation took place, while processed-type meteorites are chunks from shattered massive planetesimals.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Mahavidya Bagalamukhi, Matangi is {{the other}} Mahavidya, whose worship is {{primarily}} prescribed to acquire supernatural powers. A hymn in the Maha-bhagavata Purana asks her grace to control one's foes, while the Tantrasara says that recitation of her mantra, meditation on her form and her ritual worship gives one to the power to control people and make them attracted to oneself. Her devotees, especially Tantric sadhakas, are regarded to have transcend the pollution by offering her <b>left-over</b> or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) and thus overcome their ego. Worship of Matangi is described to allow her devotee to face the forbidden and transcend pollution, leading him to salvation or allowing him to gain supernatural powers for worldly goals. The Purashcharyarnava describes pleasing the goddess would result in her answering all the devotee's queries by whispering in her ear.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1170s Henry focused {{on trying to}} create a stable system of government, {{increasingly}} ruling through his family, but tensions over the succession arrangements were never far away, ultimately leading to a fresh revolt. Having quelled the <b>left-over</b> rebels from the Great Revolt, Richard was recognised by Henry as the Duke of Aquitaine in 1179. In 1181 Geoffrey finally married Constance and became Duke of Brittany; by now most of Brittany accepted Angevin rule, and Geoffrey was able to deal with the remaining disturbances on his own. John had spent the Great Revolt travelling alongside his father and most observers now began to regard the prince as Henry's favourite child. Henry began to grant John more lands, mostly at various nobles' expense, and in 1177 made him the Lord of Ireland. Meanwhile, Young Henry spent {{the end of the decade}} travelling in Europe, taking part in tournaments and playing only a passing role in either government or Henry and Richard's military campaigns; he was increasingly dissatisfied with his position and lack of power.|$|E
25|$|Since 2013, a new {{industrial}} site is being expanded {{on the southern}} harbour. E.ON, RWE and WindMW plan to manage operation and services of large offshore windparks from Heligoland. The range had been cleaned of <b>left-over</b> ammunition.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{proposals}} for reactors that consume nuclear waste and transmute it to other, less-harmful or shorter-lived, nuclear waste. In particular, the Integral Fast Reactor was a proposed nuclear reactor {{with a nuclear}} fuel cycle that produced no transuranic waste and in fact, could consume transuranic waste. It proceeded as far as large-scale tests, but was then canceled by the US Government. Another approach, considered safer but requiring more development, is to dedicate subcritical reactors to the transmutation of the <b>left-over</b> transuranic elements.|$|E
25|$|The CIA Deer gun was a single-shot 9×19 mm Parabellum pistol, {{made by the}} U.S. {{during the}} Vietnam War. It was {{packaged}} with three rounds of ammunition in the grip, and packed with instructions in a plastic box. If air-dropped into water, the plastic box containing the pistol would float. Like the earlier FP-45 Liberator, it was designed primarily for assassination of enemy soldiers, with the intention {{that it would be}} replaced by an enemy soldier's <b>left-over</b> equipment. The instructions for the Deer Gun were pictorial, with text in Vietnamese.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{the risk}} of contaminated-{{matching}} {{is much greater than}} matching a distant relative, such as contamination of a sample from nearby objects, or from <b>left-over</b> cells transferred from a prior test. The risk is greater for matching the most common person in the samples: Everything collected from, or in contact with, a victim is a major source of contamination for any other samples brought into a lab. For that reason, multiple control-samples are typically tested {{in order to ensure that}} they stayed clean, when prepared during the same period as the actual test samples. Unexpected matches (or variations) in several control-samples indicates a high probability of contamination for the actual test samples. In a relationship test, the full DNA profiles should differ (except for twins), to prove that a person was not actually matched as being related to their own DNA in another sample.|$|E
25|$|Voting {{stopped at}} 6 pm or {{whenever}} {{anyone who was}} in line to vote at 6 pm was done voting (article 224); the poll could be closed earlier only if {{all members of the}} Directing Committee agreed that all registered voters had cast their vote. Once the polling place closed, the Directing Committee was in charge of counting and recording the votes, {{in the presence of the}} party representatives (article 229 of the COFIPE). After the counting was over, the totals for each candidate, the total of write-in votes, the total of annulled votes, and the total of <b>left-over</b> blank ballots were recorded in the Acta de Escrutinio (official tally sheet); in addition, any incidents that occurred during the voting or counting would be described in writing (article 232). Finally, every member of the Directing Committee and every party representative present were required to sign the tally sheet; the latter were allowed to sign under protest and explain their reasons, if they so desired (article 233).|$|E
25|$|On 18 February 1943, the Scholls {{brought a}} {{suitcase}} full of leaflets {{to the university}} main building. They hurriedly dropped stacks of copies in the empty corridors for students to find {{when they left the}} lecture rooms. Leaving before the lectures had ended, the Scholls noticed that there were some <b>left-over</b> copies in the suitcase and decided to distribute them. Sophie flung the last remaining leaflets from the top floor down into the atrium. This spontaneous action was observed by the university maintenance man, Jakob Schmied. Hans and Sophie Scholl were taken into Gestapo custody. A draft of a seventh pamphlet, written by Christoph Probst, was found in the possession of Hans Scholl {{at the time of his}} arrest by the Gestapo. While Sophie Scholl got rid of incriminating evidence before being taken into custody, Hans did try to destroy the draft of the last leaflet by tearing it apart and trying to swallow it down. However, the Gestapo recovered enough of it and were able to match the handwriting with other writings from Probst, which they found when they searched Hans's apartment.|$|E
25|$|Biomass can be {{converted}} to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel. Rotting garbage, and agricultural and human waste, all release methane gasalso called landfill gas or biogas. Crops, such as corn and sugarcane, can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel, ethanol. Biodiesel, another transportation fuel, can be produced from <b>left-over</b> food products like vegetable oils and animal fats. Also, biomass to liquids (BTLs) and cellulosic ethanol are still under research. There {{is a great deal of}} research involving algal fuel or algae-derived biomass due to the fact that it's a non-food resource and can be produced at rates 5 to 10 times those of other types of land-based agriculture, such as corn and soy. Once harvested, it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol, butanol, and methane, as well as biodiesel and hydrogen. The biomass used for electricity generation varies by region. Forest by-products, such as wood residues, are common in the United States. Agricultural waste is common in Mauritius (sugar cane residue) and Southeast Asia (rice husks). Animal husbandry residues, such as poultry litter, are common in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|The {{creative}} {{output of}} the sessions for Dangerously in Love left several tracks ready for another album pressing. In late 2003, Beyoncé planned to release a follow-up album that would comprise <b>left-over</b> songs from Dangerously in Love. The move was prompted when a P.

Fujima noted that the series was [...] "quite a bit different" [...] compared to previous series he had worked on, and that he [...] "had no idea how" [...] the audience would respond to it. He explained that [...] "if you have fun reading it, then I'll be happy". In volume two, due to having <b>left-over</b> [...] "open pages", Fujima used the extra pages to [...] "describe characters" [...] and [...] "have fun".|$|E
500|$|The Pithanirnaya or Mahapithanirupana section {{from the}} Tantrachudamani {{mentions}} Viraja-kshetra in Utkala (present-day Orissa) as a Shakti Pitha, [...] with Vimala as the presiding goddess (Devi), Jagannath as Bhairava and her navel {{as the body}} part that fell here. One version of this text, however, demotes the site from a Pitha to an upa-Pitha (subordinate Pitha). Here, the Ucchishta (that is, <b>left-over</b> or partially eaten food) of Sati {{is said to be}} the [...] "fallen part" [...] ( [...] anga-pratyanga) and the temple location is called Nilachal or [...] "Blue mountain", which is the traditional name of the site of the Jagannath temple complex. Nilachal or Nila Parvat is mentioned as an upa-pitha also in the Shiva-charita with Vimala and Jagannath as the Devi and Bhairava respectively.|$|E
500|$|In 1863, the South Jordan LDS Branch was {{organized}} as {{a branch of}} the West Jordan Ward, giving South Jordan its name. [...] The Branch consisted of just nine families. [...] A school was built in 1864 out of adobe and also served as the LDS Meetinghouse for the South Jordan Branch. As South Jordan grew, a new and larger building was constructed in 1873 {{on the east side of}} the site of the present-day cemetery. [...] It had an upper and lower entrance with a granite foundation using <b>left-over</b> materials brought from the granite quarry at the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon. [...] The upper story was made of oversized adobe bricks. [...] The main hall had curtains which could be pulled to section off the hall for classes. The meetinghouse also served as the [...] "ward" [...] school when it was held during the fall and winter months. [...] It came to be known as the [...] "Mud Temple", and was in use until 1908.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{attended}} Fullerton College in {{the late}} 1970s, {{but she did not}} have a strong interest in any academic subject; instead she was focused on climbing. In the summers of 1976–78 and the early 1980s Hill frequently camped at Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley, becoming part of the climbing community centered there and joining the search and rescue team. In her autobiography, Hill describes the community as [...] "a ragged occupying army, annoying park rangers by eluding camp fees, overstaying their welcome, and comporting themselves like gypsies". As Hill describes it, climbing {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s was [...] "something that people who were outcasts in society did, people who were not conformists". As she had earlier, Hill worked {{in order to be able}} to climb. One summer, she writes, she survived in Camp 4 on only $75. In her autobiography, she describes how climbers eked out a life at the camp, recycling cans to pay for climbing ropes and subsisting on condiments and <b>left-over</b> food from tourists. However, Hill remembers [...] "these dirt-poor days... among the best and the most carefree of my life, and though my friends were often scoundrels, I felt their friendship convincingly." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2003, she {{embarked}} on the Dangerously in Love Tour in Europe and later toured alongside Missy Elliott and Alicia Keys for the Verizon Ladies First Tour in North America. On February 1, 2004, Beyoncé performed the American national anthem at Super Bowl XXXVIII, at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas. After {{the release of}} Dangerously in Love, Beyoncé had planned to produce a follow-up album using several of the <b>left-over</b> tracks. However, this was put on hold so she could concentrate on recording Destiny Fulfilled, the final studio album by Destiny's Child. Released on November 15, 2004, in the US and peaking at number two on the Billboard 200, Destiny Fulfilled included the singles [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] and [...] "Soldier", which reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Destiny's Child {{embarked on}} a worldwide concert tour, Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It and during the last stop of their European tour, in Barcelona on June 11, 2005, Rowland announced that Destiny's Child would disband following the North American leg of the tour.

2500|$|Handmade soap {{from the}} cold process also differs from industrially made soap in that an excess of fat is used, beyond that needed to consume the alkali (in a cold-pour process, this excess fat is called [...] "superfatting"), and the {{glycerol}} left in acts as a moisturizing agent. However, the glycerine also makes the soap softer and less resistant to becoming [...] "mushy" [...] if left wet. Since {{it is better to}} add too much oil and have <b>left-over</b> fat, than to add too much lye and have <b>left-over</b> lye, soap produced from the hot process also contains <b>left-over</b> glycerol and its concomitant pros and cons. Further addition of glycerol and processing of this soap produces glycerin soap. Superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat. However, if too much fat is added, it can leave a [...] "greasy" [...] feel to the skin. Sometimes, an emollient additive, such as jojoba oil or shea butter, is added [...] "at trace" [...] (i.e., {{the point at which the}} saponification process is sufficiently advanced that the soap has begun to thicken in the cold process method) in the belief that nearly all the lye will be spent and it will escape saponification and remain intact. In the case of hot-process soap, an emollient may be added after the initial oils have saponified so they remain unreacted in the finished soap. Superfatting can also be accomplished through a process known as [...] "lye discount" [...] in which the soap maker uses less alkali than required instead of adding extra fats.|$|E
2500|$|Most fusion chains during BBN {{ultimately}} terminate in 4He (helium-4), while [...] "incomplete" [...] reaction chains lead {{to small}} amounts of <b>left-over</b> 2H or 3He; the amount of these decreases with increasing baryon-photon ratio. That is, the larger the baryon-photon ratio the more reactions there will be and the more efficiently deuterium will be eventually transformed into helium-4. This result makes deuterium a very useful tool in measuring the baryon-to-photon ratio.|$|E

However, unofficially, goods are sold at reduced prices by many stores throughout the whole of January. By the time the sales officially begin the only goods left on sale are low-quality ones, often specially manufactured for the sales. Since a legislative reform to the corresponding law in 2004, season sales are now allowed over the whole year and are no longer restricted to season-related goods.

2500|$|During {{her stay}} on Celebrity Big Brother 5, Shetty {{was the target}} of racism and {{bullying}} by other housemates, chiefly by Jade Goody, Jo O'Meara and Danielle Lloyd. After correcting Goody's mother, who mispronounced Shetty's name as 'Shiwpa', Shetty was mocked for her Indian accent and was branded [...] "The Indian" [...] and was referred to as a [...] "dog" [...] by Lloyd. Referring to Shetty, O'Meara generalised that all Indians were thin because they were [...] "sick all the time" [...] as a result of undercooking their food, following their belief that Shetty had undercooked a chicken, which gave O'Meara diarrhoea. Lloyd also mentioned that she disliked Shetty touching her food because she did not [...] "know where her hands have been". Lloyd, O'Meara and Goody repeatedly maintained a belief that Shetty was [...] "fake", and [...] "a mole". After Shetty attempted to dispose of the <b>left-over</b> chicken soup down the toilet and caused a blockage, housemate Jack Tweed suggested that she should pick the bones out with her teeth and allegedly referred to her as a [...] "fucking Paki", although show producers denied this and stated that the word used was [...] "cunt". During a fierce argument, Goody told Shetty that she needed to [...] "spend a day in the slums", although the media falsely reported this as [...] "go back to the slums". Claiming that she did not know Shilpa's surname, Goody referred to her as [...] "Shilpa Fuckawallah", [...] "Shilpa Daroopa", and [...] "Shilpa Poppadom", later claiming that they were non-racist references to Indian food. Lloyd had opined that Shetty's English-speaking skills were lacking and said she should [...] "fuck off home".|$|E
