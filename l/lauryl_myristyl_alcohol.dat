5000|$|... 1-Tetradecanol, or {{commonly}} <b>myristyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (from Myristica fragrans - the nutmeg plant), is a straight-chain saturated fatty alcohol, {{with the}} molecular formula C14H30O.

5000|$|Sodium myreth sulfate is {{very similar}} to sodium laureth sulfate; the only {{difference}} is two more carbons in the fatty alcohol portion of the hydrophobic tail. It is manufactured by ethoxylation (hence the [...] "eth" [...] in [...] "myreth") of <b>myristyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Subsequently, the terminal OH group is converted to the sulfate by treatment with chlorosulfuric acid.|$|R

(order Alcyonacea, family Alcyoniidae) afforded a known glucosylcerebroside of the sarcoehrenoside-type and sinularioside (2), a new naturally triacetylated glycolipid containing two a-D-arabinopyranosyl residues and a <b>myristyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> unit. Their complete stereostructures were solved by interpretation of MS and NMR data along with CD {{analysis of}} degradation products. Sinularioside proved to moderately inhibit LPS-induced NO release, providing interesting clues into the poorly understood structure–activity relationships for anti-inflammatory glycolipids...|$|R
40|$|In Euglena {{gracilis}} {{distribution of}} radioactivity from labeled acetate into cellular components {{was quite different}} under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and {{a large part of}} it was found in wax esters in anoxia. Wax ester synthesis from acetate was immediately stimulated about 30 times by transfer of the cells into anaerobiosis, and reversed result was shown by back to aerobiosis. Similar observations were made with labeled myristic acid, but radioactivity of labeled <b>myristyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> was incorporated solely into wax esters both in aerobiosis and anaerobiosis. The activity of reduction from fatty acids to alcohols in cell-free extract was hardly changed when the cells were transferred into anaerobiosis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFirefly {{luciferase}} emits a {{burst of}} light when mixed with ATP and luciferin (L) {{in the presence of}} oxygen. This study compared the effects of long-chain n-alcohols (1 -decanol to 1 -octadecanol) and fatty acids (decanoic to octadecanoic acids) on firefly luciferase. Fatty acids were stronger inhibitors of firefly luciferase than n-alcohols. <b>Myristyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> inhibited the light intensity by 50 % (IC 50) at 13. 6 μM, whereas the IC 50 of myristic acid was 0. 68 μM. According to the Meyer-Overton rule, fatty acids are ∼ 12, 000 -fold stronger inhibitors than corresponding alcohols. The Lineweaver-Burk plot showed that myristic acid inhibited firefly luciferase in competition with luciferin, whereas <b>myristyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> inhibited it noncompetitively. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that an irreversible thermal transition occurred at ∼ 39 °C with a transition ΔHcal of 1. 57 cal g− 1. The ligand effects on the transition were evaluated by the temperature where the irreversible change is half completed. Alcohols decreased whereas fatty acids increased the thermal transition temperature of firefly luciferase. Koshland's transition-state theory (Science. 1963. 142 : 1533 – 1541) states that ligands that bind to the substrate-recognition sites induce the enzyme at a transition state, which is more stabilized than the native state against thermal perturbation. The long-chain fatty acids bound to the luciferin recognition site and stabilized the protein conformation at the transition state, which resisted thermal denaturation. Eyring's unfolding theory (Science. 1966. 154 : 1609 – 1613) postulates that anesthetics and alcohols bind nonspecifically to interfacial areas of proteins and reversibly unfold the conformation. The present results showed that alcohols do not compete with luciferin and inhibit firefly luciferase nonspecifically by unfolding the protein. Fatty acids are receptor binders and stabilize the protein conformation at the transition state...|$|R
40|$|Measurements were {{obtained}} of the interfacial resistance due to thin films of straight-chain higher alcohols and {{their effect on}} the evaporation of water. This was done by passing preheated dry air at a constant rate over water in a beaker. Unlike previous studies both phases were stitted. Four <b>alcohols,</b> dodecyl, <b>myristyl,</b> cetyl, and stearyl, were studied. A large reduction in evaporation was observed when 0. 00025 gm. of cetyl alcohol was added to 1 liter of water with gas-liquid interfacial area of 0. 2015 sq. ft. A much higher amount of stearyl alcohol, 0. 0006 g., was needed for commensurate effect. Resistance due to films of dodecyl and <b>myristyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> was neglibible. For the most part cetyl alcohol {{is the most effective}} of those tested. Plots are given of the pseudo mass transfer coefficients and interfacial resistances {{as a function of the}} amount of the various alcohols...|$|R
40|$|Fast-disintegrating (FD) tablets {{containing}} nicorandil-loaded dry emulsions {{were prepared}} and their controlledrelease properties were examined and {{compared with the}} plain FD tablets (FD tablets without dry emulsions) and commercial tablets. The dry emulsions were prepared with <b>myristyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and stearyl alcohol and their property was modified by mixing {{the ratio of the}} two alcohols. Disintegration time of the prepared FD tablets was sufficiently fast (i. e., 12 to 23 s). In vitro release of nicorandil from the FD tablets containing the dry emulsions was sustained over 6 h, while that from plain FD and commercial tablets was complate within 5 min. In vivo absorption of nicorandil from the tablets was evaluated by oral administration in beagle dogs. FD tablets containing dry emulsions showed a similar AUC, lower Cmax, and delayed Tmax compared to the plain FD and commercial tablets. These results suggest that the dry emulsionloaded FD tablets can be utilized to improve the sustained-release property of active drugs...|$|R

The structures of compounds were determined by spectroscopic methods (NMR, MS, UV, and IR) and by comparison with previously reported data. Crude extracts of leaves and stem displayed high antimicrobial activity, with Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) (values of 10. 1 – 16. 5 and 10. 2 – 20. 5 µg/mL, respectively, against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas agarici, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus warneri, while compounds 1 – 6 showed values ranging from 11. 1 to 18. 7 µg/mL or were inactive, suggesting synergistic effect.

40|$|A streptomycin-bleached mutant of Euglena {{gracilis}} strain Z, a non-photosynthetic mutant, {{was grown}} aerobically {{in the dark}} at 33, 26 and 15 "C respectively. The content of wax esters was greater at higher growth temperatures, whereas the content of paramylon was greater at lower temperatures. The highest temperature (33 "C) caused the greatest accumulation of wax esters. Wax esters synthesized at the highest temperature had carbon chain lengths of C 24 - 32 and the predominant chain lengths were C 27 and C 28. The constituent fatty acids and alcohols ranged from C 11 to C 18 with myristic acid and <b>myristyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> being the main components. At the lowest temperature (1 5 "C) the mean chain length of wax esters decreased. The most abundant wax ester was C 26, and the most abundant fatty acids and fatty alcohols of wax esters were C 13. A considerable amount (44 - 48 % of the total) of odd-carbon-numbered wax esters were present. The effect of temperature on odd-carbon-numbered wax formation is discussed in relation to possible sources of propionate or methylmalonate units...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the effects of {{synthetic}} detergents and wetting agents on respiration and glycolysis of Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms has led to the following conclusions. 1. All the cationic detergents studied are very effective inhibitors of bacterial metabolism at 1 : 3000 concentration, and several are equally active at 1 : 30, 000. Few of the anionic detergents inhibit as effectively as the cationic compounds. 2. Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms are equally sensitive to the action of the cationic detergents. On the other hand, all the anionic detergents included in our studies selectively inhibit the metabolism of Gram-positive microorganisms. 3. The inhibitory action of both types of detergents is influenced markedly by hydrogen ion concentration. Cationic detergents exhibit their maximum activity in the alkaline pH range, and the anionic, in the acid range. 4. Studies of homologous series of straight chain alkyl sulfates and sulfoacetates (C 8 to C 18) demonstrate that maximum inhibition is exerted by the 12, 14, and 16 carbon compounds (<b>lauryl,</b> <b>myristyl,</b> and cetyl). 5. It has been observed that three lauryl esters of amino acids are powerful inhibitors of bacterial metabolism. To our knowledge, the effects on bacterial metabolism of such cationic detergents (without the quaternary ammonium structure) have not been studied previously. Our results demonstrate that other cationic detergents can exhibit an inhibitory activity comparable to quaternary ammonium compounds. 6. Certain detergents stimulate bacterial metabolism at concentrations lower than the inhibiting values. This effect has been found more frequently among the anionic detergents...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{evidence}} on the safety of topical preparations containing emulsifiers is limited. Objectives The aims {{of the study were}} to assess (1) the prevalence of sensitization to some emulsifiers commonly found in topical products, (2) the sensitization to emulsifiers in relation to sex, age, and predisposing factors, and (3) the frequency of concomitant sensitization to other common allergens. Methods All consecutive patients presenting to the Allergy Unit of our Dermatological Department for allergological investigation were enrolled. All patients were patch tested with the Italian Società Italiana di Dermatologia Allergologica Professionale ed Ambientale baseline series and an additional emulsifiers series. Doubtful patch test reactions were not considered. Results Of 310 patients, 50 (16 %) were sensitized to emulsifiers with 72 positive reactions. Lauryl polyethylene glycol/polypropylene glycol- 18 / 18 methicone gave 26 positive reactions, glyceryl oleate 19, <b>myristyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> and Amerchol L 101 11. Concomitant sensitization to emulsifiers was found in 16 patients. Patients allergic to emulsifiers showed concomitant allergic reactions to allergens commonly found in cosmetics. No significant differences by sex, age, atopic diathesis, and clinical pattern at presentation were noticed. Conclusions Contact allergy to emulsifiers is more frequent than reported. Patients allergic to emulsifiers show frequent positive patch tests to other constituents of cosmetics and topical products...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>myristyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (CH 3 (CH 2) 13 OH), cetyl alcohol (CH 3 (CH 2) 15 OH) and behenyl alcohol (CH 3 (CH 2) 21 OH) on the structure, morphology, size and surface properties of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) has been investigated. Changes {{in the nature}} of the washing solvent, in the CnOH/Ca 2 + and CO 32 −/Ca 2 + molar ratios and in temperature have been also evaluated. The sole polymorph produced was rhombohedral calcite. At room temperature, while microspheres composed of submicrocubes were produced at a high molar ratio CO 32 −/Ca 2 + and low CH 3 (CH 2) 15 OH concentration, a stoichiometric molar ratio CO 32 −/Ca 2 + and high CH 3 (CH 2) 15 OH concentration induced the formation of microcubes and microboxes. In the presence of this alkanol (12 % molar) a significant enhancement of the water contact angle (ca. 40 °) resulted in a sample obtained with a stoichiometric CO 32 −/Ca 2 + ratio. These results emphasize the key role played by the three non-ionic surfactants in the formation of materials with variable crystal shape and wettability and thus technological interest for a range of applications.

40|$|Dissolved organic {{contaminants}} that {{decrease the}} surface tension of water (surfactants) {{can have an}} effect on unsaturated flow through porous media due to the dependence of capillary pressure on surface tension. One and two-dimensional (1 D, 2 D) laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to study surfactant-induced unsaturated flow. The 1 D experiments investigated differences in surfactant-induced flow as a function of contaminant mobility. The flow in a system contaminated with a high solubility, mobile surfactant, butanol, was much different than in a system contaminated with a sparingly soluble, relatively immobile surfactant, <b>myristyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (MA). Because surface tension depression caused by MA was confined to the original source zone, the MA system was modeled using a standard unsaturated flow model (HYDRUS- 1 D) by assigning separate sets of hydraulic functions to the initially clean and source zones. To simulate the butanol system, HYDRUS- 1 D was modified to incorporate surfactant concentration-dependent changes to the moisture content-pressure head and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions. Following the 1 D study, a two-dimensional flow cell (2. 4 x 1. 5 x 0. 1 m) was used to investigate the infiltration of a surfactant contaminant plume from a point source on the soil surface, through the vadose zone, and toward a shallow aquifer. Above the top of the capillary fringe the advance of the surfactant solution caused a drainage front that radiated from the point source. Upon reaching the capillary fringe, the drainage front caused a localized depression of the capillary fringe and eventually a new capillary fringe height was established. Horizontal transport of surfactant in the depressed capillary fringe caused the propagation of a wedge-shaped drainage front in the downgradient direction. The numerical model HYDRUS- 2 D was modified to account for surfactant concentration-dependent effects on the unsaturated hydraulic functions and was successfully used to simulate the surfactant infiltration experiment. The extensive propagation of the drying front and the effect of vadose zone drainage on contaminant breakthrough time demonstrate the potential importance of considering surface tension effects on unsaturated flow and transport in systems containing surface-active organic contaminants or in systems where surfactants are used for remediation of the vadose zone or unconfined aquifers...|$|R
