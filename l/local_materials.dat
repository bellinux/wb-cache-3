5|$|Daily life in Mau's {{village on}} Satawal {{involved}} harvesting taro and gathering breadfruit and coconut. The Satawalese people also raised chicken and pork and caught fish, their {{primary source of}} protein.

The island's isolation helped preserve the lifestyle of the Satawalese people and Mau's role as a navigator.

40|$|In the Southern Kalimantan {{lies the}} mountainous range which is calledMeratusMountain. In this mountain, there live Dayak Meratus tribe or more {{common with the}} name of Dayak Bukit tribe. The Dayak Bukit tribe has a {{traditional}} house named Rumah Balai. At present Rumah Balai has abandoned the heritage values that given from the ancestors. The traditional houses have vernacular values however if the tradition values has been abandoned has it still the vernacular values? To answer this problem this study analyzes the vernacular values of Rumah Balai with the limitation on the <b>local</b> <b>material</b> as the realization of vernacular values toward the traditional Rumah Balai of Dayak Bukit tribe. This study formulates turner 2 ̆ 7 s theory (2002) about the establishment of vernacular architecture to find out the concept of <b>local</b> <b>material</b> as the realization of vernacular values of Rumah Balai of Dayak Bukit tribe as well as how is the implementation of <b>local</b> <b>material</b> as the realization of vernacular values in Rumah Balai of that Dayak Bukit tribe. By applying the qualitative rationalistic can be found that the concept of <b>local</b> <b>material</b> in Rumah Balai of Dayak Bukit tribe includes the sacred values because there are rules and norm. Meanwhile the implementation of <b>local</b> <b>material</b> as vernacular values is since on the structure and construction system as the result of local knowledge of Dayak Bukit tribe...|$|R

5|$|Before modern times, {{buildings}} were usually constructed of <b>local</b> <b>materials,</b> including wood, thatch etc. The Nook in Oulton (dated 1611) {{is a rare}} example of an original half-timbered house. Of the more durable materials, there are three rocks which have been substantially used. These are gritstone (a sort of sandstone) found {{to the north and}} west (e.g. Kirstall Abbey, Leeds Town Hall or Harewood House), different sandstones in the Yorkshire Coal Measures, and limestone to the north and east, as is shown in older villages (now suburbs) in these directions. To the south of the city are substantial clay deposits, so that red brick has been the predominant building material for the extensive nineteenth century housing. The particularly fine clay found in Burmantofts led to a decorative covering of terracotta or glazed Architectural Faience being used on both interior and exterior walls of important buildings.|$|E

5|$|Buildings in Chamba were {{traditionally}} constructed using <b>local</b> <b>materials.</b> Buildings {{were made}} out of dry stone masonry, with the walls and floors of the older houses plastered with a concoction of clay and cow-dung. Thick wooden beams were used to support the walls, paying attention to durability and to withstand earthquakes, and wooden cantilever construction was often used to support the verandas. The staircases and doors were made from wood, with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by two lamps to light it at night. Before {{the arrival of the}} British, who introduced slate roofs to Chamba, roofs were covered with planks, coated in clay. Few of these houses remain today, although a number still have wood-clay roofs in villages in the suburbs.|$|E
5|$|Medieval vernacular {{architecture}} in rural environments {{made use of}} <b>local</b> <b>materials</b> and styles. As in England, cruck construction was used, employing pairs of curved timbers to support the roof; however they were usually hidden from view. In rural areas there was extensive use of turf {{to fill in the}} walls, sometimes on a stone base, but they were not long lasting and had to be rebuilt frequently, perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the most common building material was stone, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. Different regions used broom, heather, straw, turfs or reeds for roofing.|$|E
5|$|The museum’s plan {{concept was}} {{developed}} by architect, Laurie Baker, without charging any fee, because of his interest in rural architectural design.

5|$|Vernacular {{architecture}} {{of this period}} continued to dependent on <b>local</b> <b>materials</b> and styles. Often built by groups of friends and family, {{the homes of the}} rural poor were usually of very simple construction. Contemporaries noted that cottages in the Highlands and Islands tended to be cruder, with single rooms, slit windows and earthen floors, often shared by a large family. In contrast many Lowland cottages had distinct rooms and chambers, were clad with plaster or paint and even had glazed windows. In the early 1800s urban settings also included traditional thatched houses, beside the larger, stone and slate roofed town houses of merchants and urban gentry.|$|E
5|$|While {{urban centres}} were rebuilt in <b>local</b> <b>materials,</b> {{including}} Aberdeen in granite and Glasgow in red sandstone, {{the homes of}} the rural poor remained basic, particularly in the Highlands. In the cities they were confined to the sprawl of suburban tenements like those of the Gorbals in Glasgow. One response to growing population was the creation of planned new towns, like those at Inverary and New Lanark. The nineteenth century also was the revival of the Scots Baronial style, pioneered at Walter Scott's Abbotsford House and confirmed in popularity by Queen Victoria's residence at Balmoral Castle. There was also a revival of Gothic styles in church architecture. Neo-classicism continued to be a major movement in the works of architects including William Henry Playfair and Alexander 'Greek' Thomson. The later part of the century also saw {{some of the most important}} architectural products of new engineering, including the iconic Forth Bridge.|$|E

With a lack of long span structural timber, the crucks were sometimes raised and supported on the walls. Walls were often built of stone, and could have gaps filled with turf, or plastered with clay. In some regions wattled walls filled in with turf were employed, sometimes on a stone base. Turf-filled walls were not long-lasting, {{and had to be}} rebuilt perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof.

40|$|For the {{designing}} of safety-relevant components {{particularly by}} means of finite element calculations, great significance {{is attached to the}} determination of <b>local</b> <b>material</b> parameters in the welding region.
