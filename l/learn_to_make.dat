They <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> embroidered pillowcases and bed coverings or crocheted lace tablecloths, bedcovers, and lace trim. However, Western-style handicrafts {{such as these}} have not become widely popular outside the school setting. They require expensive imported materials {{that can only be}} purchased in major towns. Village women {{are much more likely to}} turn their efforts to weaving mats or beating barkcloth, which can be done with free local material.|$|E

500|$|Most of the {{academic}} analysis of Godwin's work focuses on challenges her characters have as women. According to Contemporary Fiction Writers of the South, a typical protagonist in Godwin's novels is a young woman that [...] "in search of herself, confronts obstacles caused by her family, her lovers, her husband, or her own inanition as she struggles to establish her independence and secure her identity through her work." [...] The main character may be personally flawed, then achieve self-reflection or personal growth thanks to the support of their community or a mentor. Main characters often make poor choices, but become a better person, <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> better decisions and build stronger bonds often {{as a result of}} intellectual pursuits. According to critic Anne Cheney, the protagonist may be [...] "searching for happiness, academic or artistic achievement, love, respect, or, more generally, meaning in life." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{trying and}} failing to find work in New Hampshire, in 1833 Wilson walked {{more than one hundred}} miles to Natick, Massachusetts seeking {{employment}} or a trade. Having met William P. Legro, a shoemaker who was willing to train him, Wilson hired himself out for five months to <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> leather shoes called brogans. [...] Wilson learned the trade in a few weeks, bought out his employment contract for $15, and opened his own shop, intending to save enough money to study law. Wilson had success as a shoemaker, and was able to save several hundred dollars in a relatively short time. [...] This success gave rise to legends about Wilson's skill; according to one story that grew with retelling, he once attempted to make one hundred pairs of shoes without sleeping, and fell asleep with the one hundredth pair in his hand. [...] Wilson's shoe making experience {{led to the creation of}} the political nicknames his supporters later used to highlight his working class roots—the [...] "Natick Cobbler" [...] and the [...] "Natick Shoemaker".|$|E

2500|$|Audiation {{is a term}} Gordon coined in 1975 {{to refer}} to {{comprehension}} and internal realization of music, or the sensation of an individual hearing or feeling sound {{when it is not}} physically present. Musicians previously used terms such as aural perception or aural imagery to describe this concept, though aural imagery would imply a notational component while audiation does not necessarily do so. Gordon suggests that [...] "audiation is to music what thought is to language." [...] His research is based on similarities between how individuals learn language and how they <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> and understand music. Gordon specifies that audiation potential is an element of music aptitude, arguing that to demonstrate music aptitude one must use audiation.|$|E
2500|$|Baden-Powell {{wanted a}} Scout to <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his own decisions, {{as he felt}} this would help the {{children}} grow and mature. Baden-Powell wrote that a Scout should paddle his own canoe, metaphorically speaking. He should travel not in a rowing boat, {{with his back to}} where he goes, rowed by others and someone else at the rudder, but alone in a canoe: facing the future, paddling and steering by himself. Scouting teaches self-reliance by bringing the Scouts into a challenging, somewhat risky environment, without help in the direct neighbourhood. Therefore the program is based on an adult, adventurous, and appealing outdoor life. [...] "A man's job cut down to boy's size." ...|$|E

2500|$|The game {{features}} a passive form of crafting, known as Crew Skills, {{in which a}} player's companions carry out gathering and crafting tasks asynchronously to the player's adventures out in the world. [...] Each class gets five companions via their storyline. The player can assign up to five companions to perform up to 3 various skills. Crafting skills allow the player's companions to create items, and the player can reverse engineer many items to possibly <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a better version. The item is destroyed in the process, but the player gets some of the materials back. Gathering skills allow the player or their companions to gather resources out in the world. Mission skills allow the player's companions to perform acts on the player's behalf, gaining the player Light or Darkside influence and other rewards, such as medical items or companion gifts.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1880s, Carp openly {{stated that}} the Junimist goal was the {{complete}} integration into society of people with no wealth of their own—or, as he called them, [...] "proletarians". This, more than the protection of landed property, inspired him to oppose land reform. Carp argued that the land's division into small plots was inoperable, and therefore not desirable, and only saw industrial agriculture emerging from the historical estates. Additionally, the Romanian aristocrat opposed on principle {{the idea that the}} state should become involved in redistribution, arguing that the landless would in time purchase, and [...] "slowly" [...] <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the best of, their own parcels. In line with this vision, when indentured peasants threatened to stop working on the estates, he proposed sending in armed soldiers as their supervisors. His belief in labor as an instrument of self-help was taken up in his own private life: at age 70, Carp could be seen planting walnut trees or packing butter, although, to the left-wing journalist Constantin Bacalbașa, he still appeared a generally listless character.|$|E

It was known that this individual had no prior experience {{as she had been}} hand-reared. New Caledonian crows have been observed to use an easily available small tool to get a less easily available longer tool, and then use this to get an otherwise inaccessible longer tool to get food that was out of reach of the shorter tools. One bird, [...] "Sam", spent 110 seconds inspecting the apparatus before completing each of the steps without any mistakes. This is an example of sequential tool use, which represents a higher cognitive function compared to many other forms of tool use and is the first time this has been observed in non-trained animals. Tool use has been observed in a non-foraging context, providing the first report of multi-context tool use in birds. Captive New Caledonian crows have used stick tools to make first contact with objects that were novel and hence potentially dangerous, while other individuals have been observed using a tool when food was within reach but placed next to a model snake. It has been claimed [...] "Their [...] tool-making skills exceed those of chimpanzees and are more similar to human tool manufacture than those of any other animal." ...|$|E
