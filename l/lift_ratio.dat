Ejector has been modeled by considering experimental data based correlations of component efficiencies {{to take care}} of all irreversibilities. Ejector area ratio has been optimized based on maximum coefficient of performance (COP) for typical air-conditioner operating temperatures. Selected refrigerants have been compared based on area ratio, pressure <b>lift</b> <b>ratio,</b> entrainment ratio, COP, COP improvement and volumetric cooling capacity. Effects of normal boiling point and critical point on the performances have been studied as well. Using ejector as an expansion device, maximum improvement in COP is noted in R 1234 yf (10. 1 %), which reduces the COP deviation with R 134 a (4. 5 % less in basic cycle and 2. 5 % less in ejector cycle). Hence, R 1234 yf seems to be best alternative for ejector expansion system due to its mild flammability and comparable volumetric capacity and cooling COP. refrigerant R 161 is superior to R 134 a in terms of both COP and volumetric cooling capacity, although may be restricted for low capacity application due to its flammability...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} four sailboat keels is presented. Three of the keels have bulbs of different shapes: an L-keel, a T-keel and an integrated bulb keel. These shapes are found on most sailing yachts designed {{during the past}} twenty years. The fourth keel is a standard fin keel. Lift and drag of the four keels have been measured in a wind tunnel {{and the results are}} compared. To obtain more practical results the measured data have been input into a VPP, and the performance of a 40 foot yacht equipped with the different keels is evaluated. Although the performance differences are not great, they are clearly of interest in yacht racing. Since one purpose of the experimental campaign was to develop a data base for CFD validation, emphasis is placed on uncertainty estimation. A numerical optimisation of the most common bulb, the integrated one, is also reported. A CFD code was linked to an optimiser and a CAD program, and the drag to <b>lift</b> <b>ratio</b> of the keel was minimized at an angle of attack of 4 °.

40|$|Abstract — A {{jet ejector}} uses a jet of primary fluid to induce a {{peripheral}} secondary flow often against back pressure. Expansion of primary jet produces a partial vacuum near the secondary flow inlet creating a rapid re-pressurization of the mixed fluids {{followed by a}} diffuser to increase the pressure at the exit. Using the geometrical design parameters obtained by solving the governing equations, a CFD analysis is made using the FLUENT software to evaluate the optimum entrainment ratio that could be achieved for a given set of operating conditions, where the entrainment ratio (ER) is {{the ratio of the}} mass flow rate of the secondary fluid (propelled stream) to the primary fluid (motive fluid). The three main internal process forming sources of ejector irreversibility are mixing, kinetic energy losses, and normal shock. The CRMC method produces a diffuser geometry that removes thermodynamic shock process with in the diffuser at the design point-operating conditions. In order to match the ER that is achievable theoretically, an effort is made to force charge the propelled stream using a blower so that the momentum difference between the motive and the propelled fluid is minimized. The decrease in momentum difference increases the ER and the pressure <b>lift</b> <b>ratio</b> (PDE/PS) compared to the values obtained using the conventional methods, where PDE is the exit pressure and PS is the secondary fluid pressure. It also reduces losses due to pure mixing and kinetic energy loss. Experimental results obtained using the forced draft system is found to match the results obtained from the FLUENT analysis...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, applied mathematicians {{in the field of}} convex {{optimization}} have developed powerful new tools for solving certain classes of constrained optimization problems extremely reliably and efficiently. This paper introduces the (perhaps surprising) discovery that a number of prevailing physics-based models for wind turbine aerodynamics have an underlying convex mathematical structure that these new methods can exploit. In particular, they can be expressed via the functional forms that define Geometric Programs (GPs). Modern GP solvers are extremely fast even on large problems, require no initial guesses or tuning of solver parameters, and guarantee globally optimal solutions. In addition, for various models that cannot be manipulated into the forms required by GP, it is often possible to fit compact GP models which accurately approximate the original models. The combination of 1) fast solution methods, 2) GP-compatible aerodynamic models (presented herein), and 3) GP-compatibility of structural models (well established) makes the application of GP to large wind turbine design problems a promising approach.

40|$|A novel gas-gas ejector {{enhanced}} autocascade {{refrigeration cycle}} is proposed in this paper. The novel cycle uses an additional gas-gas ejector and a phase separator {{to accomplish a}} secondary composition separation for the zeotropic mixture used in the cycle. This proposed cycle can lift the evaporating pressure and further improve the cycle performance. The performance comparisons between the novel cycle and a basic autocascade refrigeration cycle using the zeotropic mixtures of R 23 /R 134 a are conducted by theoretical method. In the evaporator inlet temperature range of - 60 Â°C to - 40 Â°C, the coefficient of performance (COP) and volumetric cooling capacity of the novel cycle can be improved by up {{to an average of}} 25. 9 % and 32. 7 % compared to that of the basic cycle, respectively. The effect of some key parameters on the performance of the novel cycle is further investigated. As the intermediate pressure of the novel cycle decreases in a certain range, the entrainment ratio and pressure <b>lift</b> <b>ratio</b> of the ejector increase and it further leads to the performance improvement of the novel cycle. In a given vapor quality range, the COP of the basic cycle show a monotonic increase tendency with the vapor quality at the condenser outlet, but the novel cycle has an optimal vapor quality to obtain the maximum COP. The simulation results shows that the novel cycle yields an improvement of 40. 1 - 21. 4 % in the COP over the basic cycle as the vapor quality varies from 0. 3 to 0. 5. Besides, there exist optimal mixture compositions for the two cycles to obtain the optimum performance. The maximum COP of the two cycles can be obtained under the considered condition when the R 134 a mass fraction of the zeotropic mixture R 23 /R 134 a at the compressor inlet is fixed at about 0. 6...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates a novel {{combination}} of a jet-pump refrigeration cycle and a thermal (ice) storage (TIS) system that could substantially reduce the electrical energy requirements attributable to comfort cooling. Two methods of TIS were identified; spray ice TIS would use evaporative freezing to store ice on a vertical surface,and encapsulated ice TIS would freeze a bed of encapsulated elements by sublimation freezing. Thestudy also investigates jet-pump refrigeration at partload and a convergent-divergent design manufactured from a thermoset plastic to make recommendations for performance enhancement for {{a system that has}} a low COP. An experimental rig was built to investigate the novel concepts in the laboratory. Encapsulated ice TIS was superior to spray ice TIS because, for the same nominal secondary flow, sublimation freezing causes an increase in coolth storage rate of about 10 % compared to evaporative freezing. Encapsulated ice stores experience difficulties in fully discharging their coolth (approximately 6 % in this case), but spray ice TIS can be used to produce an ice/brine slurry enabling all of the ice to be used, and so may be more suitable if the unmelted ice represents {{a large proportion of the}} cooling capacity. Approximately 85 % to 90 % of the ice formed on the vertical surface during spray ice TIS testing was formed by evaporative freezing from a falling film. At high saturation conditions, heat is transferred mainly by conduction across the falling film. Both the growth of an ice layer on a vertical surface and freezing of encapsulated elements were found to be successful, but a large data spread was observed during spray ice TIS testing. It was thought that a variation in the steady-state saturation conditions in the evaporator/ice store was caused by variability of droplet size distribution from the spray nozzle flow, which may make a full-scale system unreliable. The COP of the spray ice TIS system was approximately 0. 15 compared to a COP of approximately 0. 25 found during encapsulated ice TIS testing. The difference was because of the use of an over-expanded primary nozzle, which restricted secondary flow and increased momentum losses. A primary nozzle that expands close to the design evaporator saturation conditions should be used to maximise entrainment ratio. The COP of a jet-pump TIS is low, but a system designed to operate at off-peak periods could increase the COP to about 0. 8 by taking advantage of the lower ambient conditions. The measurement of entrainment ratio was used successfully to determine ice storage rate and COP. This was valid because of the assumption that the saturation conditions in the evaporator/ice store approached steady-state. However, over longer periods that would be found in large-scale systems, the ice storage rate and entrainment ratio may fall substantially. The steady-state assumption could still be used to observe the change in evaporator conditions by sampling over short time intervals (30 minutes). At part-load, increases in evaporator saturation temperature could increase entrainment ratio substantially (50 % increase) for only a small reduction in critical pressure <b>lift</b> <b>ratio</b> Ns *(15 % reduction). A variation in chilled water temperature could be used to boost entrainment ratio at the peak demand. The variation in Ns* is too small to use this strategy to control the jet-pump with respect to condenser operating conditions. The entrainment ratio is approximately proportional to the diff-user to primary nozzle area ratio. A doubling of entrainment ratio was attained for only a 15 % reduction in Ns*. The change in geometry from a constant area throat to a convergent-divergent design caused the flow through the jet-pump to vary with outlet conditions indicating that secondary flow was not choked. Higher entrainment ratios and pressure lift ratios were observed, but the entrainment ratio varied with outlet conditions in the form of peaks and troughs, making its operation unpredictable. This was thought to be caused by the restriction in secondary flow area due to the interaction of the primary jet and the curved wall. The convergent-divergent design manufactured from a thermoset plastic was successfully tested, showing that a plastic material can be used as a material of construction. In principle, a large number of jet-pump units could be manufactured from a single mould, reducing the first cost. The investigation proved the concept of jet-pump TIS. Waste-heat could be utilised over 24 hours and year round, increasing the efficiency of the process. The use of a convergent-divergent throat design, multiple geometry jet-pumps and operation at off-peak periods can maximise the performance over a cooling season, and be competitive with other TIS and chiller systems. The mass production of jet-pumps using injection moulding techniques could reduce substantially the capital cost of a system. All of these factors should encourage the development of such systems, so that the harmful emissions caused by the use of air conditioning systems can be minimised...|$|E
