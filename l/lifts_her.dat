5|$|Some {{time later}} Susan finds David, {{who has just}} been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high {{platform}} at his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she'd found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur {{to be closer to}} him. She tells David that her Aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life. Unconsciously swaying the ladder from side to side upon hearing David's further words of endearment and love, Susan tells him that she loves him too, then notices that the ladder {{is on the verge of}} falling over. Frightened, she climbs onto and over the skeleton, but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand, she dangles below him, and he <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> onto the platform. Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work, David soon accepts the destruction and chaos, gives in, and hugs and kisses Susan.|$|E
25|$|After {{the credits}} {{there is a}} cutscene with a little girl, looking at that same tree Sae always was. Her father comes in behind her and <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> up. If you look close enough, {{you can see the}} child's father is Kouhei. Putting the pieces together: Sae and Kouhei get married and have a daughter, they live in Sae's {{childhood}} home.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Cupid's wound has healed into a scar, and he escapes his mother's {{house by}} flying out a window. When he finds Psyche, he draws the sleep {{from her face}} and replaces it in the box, then pricks her with an arrow that does no harm. He <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> into the air, and takes her to present the box to Venus.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her, and then {{stretched}} {{out his hand and}} <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> to her feet.|$|R
60|$|With that Sir Tristram kissed Belle Isoult {{upon the}} forehead, {{and then he}} <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> up and carried {{her in his arms}} down the stairs of the tower and sat her upon her horse.

25|$|As the {{two women}} sip coffee Kitty admits {{she has to go}} to {{hospital}} for a few days and wants Laura to feed her pet dog. She tells Laura, somewhat evasively, that the problem is in her uterus, probably the cause of her infertility. Laura moves to comfort Kitty with an embrace. She feels a sense of {{what it would be like}} to be a man, and also a sort of jealousy towards Ray, Kitty's husband. Both women capitulate to the moment, to holding each other. Laura is kissing Kitty's forehead, when Kitty <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> face and {{the two women}} kiss each other on the lips.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the story, Piro {{had seen}} Nanasawa Kimiko at an Anna Miller's restaurant, {{where she is}} a waitress, after Tsubasa brought him and Largo there. Later on, Piro {{encounters}} Kimiko outside a train station, where she is worrying aloud that she will miss an audition because she has forgotten her money and railcard. Piro hands her his own railcard and walks off before she can refuse his offer. This event causes Kimiko to develop an idealized vision of her benefactor, an image which is shattered {{the next time they}} meet. Despite this, she gradually develops feelings for Piro, though she is too shy to admit them. Later on in the story, Kimiko's outburst on a radio talk show causes her to suddenly rise to idol status. Angered by the hosts' derisive comments about fanboys, she comes to the defense of her audience, immediately and unintentionally securing their obsessive adoration. Later, her new horde of fanboys find out where she works and flock to the restaurant, obsessively trying to get pictures up her skirt. Piro works undercover as a busboy {{to get rid of all}} cameras. The scene eventually builds to a climax, in which Kimiko shouts at the fanboys and <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> skirt in defiance, and they take photographs. Piro, provoked by her outburst into actively defending her, threatens the fanboy crowd, and collects all of their memory cards with the photos. On the way back from the restaurant, Kimiko is suffering from the aftermath of the scene and lashes out at Piro on the subway, which causes him to walk off.|$|E
500|$|Smith's longest-running role is voicing Lisa Simpson on The Simpsons. She has voiced Lisa since 1987, {{beginning}} with The Simpsons shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show. Smith had initially {{been asked to}} audition {{for the role of}} Lisa's brother Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila thought her voice was too high. Smith later recalled [...] "I always sounded too much like a girl, I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'" [...] Smith was given the role of Lisa, instead. She denies rumors that she almost turned down the role, though admits she had never planned a career in voice-over work. Pietila stated that, having seen her in Living on Salvation Street, Smith was always her preferred choice. Smith <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> voice up slightly to perform the role. Lisa is the only regular character voiced by Smith, although in some earlier episodes, she provided some of Maggie's squeaks and occasional speaking parts. Smith has only voiced characters other than Lisa on very rare occasions, with those characters usually being some derivative of Lisa, such as Lisa Bella in [...] "Last Tap Dance in Springfield" [...] and Lisa, Jr. in [...] "" [...] (both from season 11 in 2000). Smith spends two days a week recording the show.|$|E

2500|$|Female-female genital {{sex is not}} {{exclusive}} to humans. Females of the bonobo species, found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, also engage in this act, usually referred to by primatologists as GG rubbing (genital-to-genital). [...] "Perhaps the bonobo's most typical sexual pattern, undocumented in any other primate, is genito-genital rubbing (or GG rubbing) between adult females," [...] stated primatologist Frans de Waal. [...] "One female facing another clings with arms and legs to a partner that, standing on both hands and feet, <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> off the ground." ...|$|E
2500|$|The scene {{shifts to}} the Count of Poitou's château where René has arrived to great rejoicing. In {{celebration of the}} {{impending}} marriage, a ballet {{in the form of}} a human chess game is performed. After the ballet the Sibyl of Samos appears accompanied by a chorus of Greek maidens, priests, and augurs. To the consternation of the Count of Poitou, the Sibyl predicts future unhappiness. René is also worried and observes to himself that the Sibyl's voice is strangely familiar. She then takes him aside and slowly <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> veil to reveal that she is actually Mélusine. She tells him that Blanche has been unfaithful to him while he was away and asks him join her in the gardens later that night where she will provide proof.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the day of}} its unveiling, the {{painting}} received considerable press attention from photographers, cameramen, reporters, and art critics and lovers. The portrait divided critics, seen in a negative light by many. Michael Glover of The Independent [...] described it as [...] "catastrophic", and noted that it lacked context. When presented with Glover's comments on the BBC, the artist laughed them off, quipping [...] "can he draw?" [...] He noted that he believes in his work, and understands {{that there would be}} different points of view. Some critics believed that the shading below her eyes and her jawline aged her. Waldemar Januszczak of the Sunday Times described the portrait as [...] "disappointing", saying that it was [...] "pretty ordinary... He made her look older than she is and her eyes don't sparkle {{in the way that they}} do and there's something rather dour about the face." [...] Robin Simon of the Daily Mail described it as [...] "rotten" [...] and said it is fortunate that Catherine looks nothing like it in real life. Charlotte Higgins, of The Guardian, compared the depiction of Kate to a character in the Twilight franchise, saying, [...] "The first thing that strikes you about Middleton's visage as it looms from the sepulchral gloom of her first official portrait is the dead eyes: a vampiric, malevolent glare beneath heavy lids. Then there's the mouth: a tightly pursed, mean little lip-clench (she is, presumably, sucking in her fangs). And God knows what is going on with the washed-out cheeks: she appears to be nurturing a gobbet of gum in her lower right cheek. The hair is dull and lifeless; the glimpse of earring simply <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> to the status of Sloaney, rather than merely proletarian, undead." ...|$|E
