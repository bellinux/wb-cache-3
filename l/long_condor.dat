50|$|A {{good example}} of a fairly complex option {{strategy}} {{that is hard to}} analyze without a profit/loss chart is a <b>Long</b> <b>Condor</b> - an option strategy consisting of options with 4 different strikes.|$|E

5000|$|A short {{strangle}} is effectively a <b>long</b> iron <b>condor,</b> {{but without the}} wings. It is constructed by writing an out-of-the-money put and an out-of-the money call. A {{short strangle}} with the same short strikes as an iron condor is generally more profitable, but unlike a <b>long</b> iron <b>condor,</b> the short strangle offers no protection to limit losses should the underlying instrument's spot price change dramatically.|$|R
5000|$|A bear call spread {{is simply}} the upper side of a <b>long</b> iron <b>condor</b> and has {{virtually}} identical initial and maintenance margin requirements.|$|R
50|$|Neutral trading {{strategies}} that are bearish on volatility profit when the underlying stock price experiences little or no movement. Such strategies include the short straddle, short strangle, ratio spreads, <b>long</b> <b>condor,</b> long butterfly, and long Calendar or Double Calendar.|$|E
5000|$|Real-Life X-Files and its sequel, The Mystery Chronicle are {{a series}} of short essays on the histories, {{expanding}} mythologies, and likely causes of several dozen mysteries. In some cases, Nickell re-creates the legends, demonstrating that no special powers are needed to duplicate the effects. In others, he answers common lore with facts uncovered in his research. In 1982, Nickell and five of his relatives created a 440 foot <b>long</b> <b>condor</b> in a field in Kentucky by plotting coordinates of points on a drawing, a technique Nickell believes could have been used to create the Nazca Lines in Peru. [...] "That is, on the small drawing we would measure along the center line from one end (the bird's beak) to a point on the line directly opposite the point to be plotted (say a wing tip). Then we would measure the distance from the center line to the desired point. A given number of units on the small drawing would require the same number of units—larger units—on the large drawing." ...|$|E
50|$|Facilities at the harbour {{include two}} ro-ro ramps for cars and lorries that travel on car/passenger ferries {{such as the}} 102m <b>long</b> {{trimaran}} <b>Condor</b> Liberation or freight/car/passenger traditional ferries such as the Commodore Clipper.|$|R
50|$|The <b>long</b> iron <b>condor</b> is an {{effective}} strategy for capturing any perceived excessive volatility risk premium, which {{is the difference between}} the realized volatility of the underlying and the volatility implied by options prices.|$|R
50|$|An option trader who {{considers}} a <b>long</b> iron <b>condor</b> {{is one who}} expects {{the price of the}} underlying instrument to change very little for a significant duration of time. This trader might also consider {{one or more of the}} following strategies.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the premium}} earned on {{the sales of}} the written {{contracts}} {{is greater than the}} premium paid on the purchased contracts, a <b>long</b> iron <b>condor</b> is typically a net credit transaction. This net credit represents the maximum profit potential for an iron condor.|$|R
50|$|The {{potential}} {{loss of a}} <b>long</b> iron <b>condor</b> {{is the difference between}} the strikes on either the call spread or the put spread (whichever is greater if it is not balanced) multiplied by the contract size (typically 100 or 1000 shares of the underlying instrument), less the net credit received.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} in late-2014 that Condor Ferries had purchased the 102m <b>long</b> trimaran <b>Condor</b> Liberation for £50 million. from the Australian shipbuilders Austal. She replaced HSC Condor Vitesse and HSC Condor Express on Condor Ferries' UK - Channel Islands operations. This led {{to the end of}} operations from Weymouth, due to the harbour facilities being insufficient to handle the new vessel.|$|R
5000|$|A long iron {{butterfly}} is {{very similar}} to a <b>long</b> iron <b>condor,</b> except that the inner, short strikes are at the same strike. The iron butterfly requires the underlying instrument's spot price to remain virtually unchanged {{over the life of the}} contract in order to retain the full net credit, but the trade is potentially more profitable (larger net credit) than an Iron Condor.|$|R
50|$|Neutral trading {{strategies}} that are bullish on volatility profit when the underlying stock price experiences big moves upwards or downwards. They include the long straddle, <b>long</b> strangle, short <b>condor</b> (Iron Condor), short butterfly, and long Calendar.|$|R
5000|$|The iron condor is {{an option}} trading {{strategy}} utilizing two vertical spreads - a put spread and a call spread with the same expiration and four different strikes. A <b>long</b> iron <b>condor</b> is essentially selling {{both sides of the}} underlying instrument by simultaneously shorting the same number of calls and puts, then covering each position with the purchase of further out of the money call(s) and put(s) respectively. The converse produces a short iron condor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{position}} is {{so named because}} of {{the shape of the}} profit/loss graph, which loosely resembles a large-bodied bird, such as a condor. In keeping with this analogy, traders often refer to the inner options collectively as the [...] "body" [...] and the outer options as the [...] "wings". The word iron in the name of this position indicates that, like an iron butterfly, this {{position is}} constructed using both calls and puts, by combining a bull put spread with a bear call spread. The combination of these two credit spreads makes the <b>long</b> iron <b>condor</b> (and the <b>long</b> iron butterfly) a credit spread, {{despite the fact that it}} is [...] "long." [...] This distinguishes the position from a plain Condor position (and the plain Butterfly), which would be constructed with all calls or all puts, by combining either a bull call spread with a bear call spread or a bull put spread with a bear put spread. Because the <b>long,</b> plain <b>Condor</b> (and Butterfly) combine a debit spread with a credit spread, that overall position is instead entered at a net debit (though usually small).|$|R

50|$|In 1938 a Lufthansa Focke-Wulf Fw 200 <b>Condor</b> <b>long</b> range {{airliner}} flew non-stop from Berlin to New York {{and returned}} non-stop as a proving flight {{for the development}} of passenger carrying services. This was the first landplane to fulfil this function and marked a departure from the British and American reliance on seaplanes for long over-water routes. A regular Lufthansa Transatlantic service was planned but didnt start before World War II.|$|R
5000|$|The Nazca [...] "drew" [...] {{several hundred}} simple but huge {{curvilinear}} animal and human figures by this technique. In total, the earthwork project is huge and complex: the area encompassing the lines is nearly 450 km2, {{and the largest}} figures can span nearly 1200 ft. Some of the measurements for the figures conclude that the hummingbird is 93 m (310 ft) <b>long,</b> the <b>condor</b> is 134 m (440 ft), the monkey is 93 m (310 ft) by 58 m (190 ft), and the spider is 47 m (150 ft). The extremely dry, windless, and constant climate of the Nazca region has preserved the lines well. This desert {{is one of the}} driest on Earth and maintains a temperature around 25 °C all year round. The lack of wind has helped keep the lines uncovered and visible.|$|R
5000|$|Condorito: The main character, Condorito is an {{anthropomorphic}} condor, lackadaisical and unambitious, {{but also}} kind, loyal, friendly and ingenious. Always a picaresque character, he {{is a sort}} of antihero who solves his problems using his wit, not his talent or work. He is portrayed as holding a wide variety of jobs (or none whatsoever), to humorous effect. His origins are obscure: in one strip it is said that his condor father threw him out of the nest in the Andes Mountains and that he grew up among humans, thereby acquiring his anthropomorphic characteristics; however, such references are very rare, and Condorito is often portrayed as a regular guy living a very human life. Originally, his head was that of a regular <b>condor</b> (<b>long</b> beak, larger neck feathers) and he smoked, but over the years, his head became rounder and the cigarette was dropped to appeal to kids. However he retain some condor characteristics like his tail (that normally goes outside his pants in a patch) and his paws (so big that he must wear sandals).|$|R
