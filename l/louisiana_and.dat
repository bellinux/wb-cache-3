5|$|Edith {{continued}} {{moving to}} the west-northwest, heading towards the coast of Mexico, but early on September 14, the storm stalled while located just {{off the coast of}} Tamaulipas. A mid-latitude trough of low pressure approached the storm, and caused Edith to turn to slowly drift towards the northeast. Located only miles from the Mexican coast, Edith again failed to strengthen until September 15, when it accelerated northeastward and regained hurricane status. The hurricane turned to the east-northeast as it approached the coast of <b>Louisiana,</b> <b>and</b> made landfall on September 16 in a sparsely populated area 30 miles (48 km) east of Cameron with winds of 105 mph (170 km/h), equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane in the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Edith rapidly weakened over land, degenerating into a tropical storm over <b>Louisiana,</b> <b>and</b> into a tropical depression over Mississippi. It continued to the east-northeast, and dissipated over northwestern Georgia on September 18.|$|E
