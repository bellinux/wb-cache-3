Provincial-level administrative units selected students with outstanding records to take the examinations. Additionally, preselection examinations were organized by the provinces, autonomous regions, and special municipalities for potential students (from three to five times the number of places allotted). These candidates were actively encouraged to take the examination to ensure that a sufficient number of good applicants would be available. Cadres with at least two years of work experience were recruited for selected departments in a small number of universities on an experimental basis. Preferential admission treatment (in spite of lower test scores) was given to minority candidates, students from disadvantaged areas, and those who agreed in advance to work in <b>less</b> <b>developed</b> <b>regions</b> after graduation.|$|E
25|$|There {{are limited}} {{national}} and international studies into the burden of ABPA, made more difficult by a non-standardized diagnostic criteria. Estimates of between 0.5–3.5% have been made for ABPA burden in asthma, and 1–17.7% in CF. Five national cohorts, detecting ABPA prevalence in asthma (based on GINA estimates), were used in a recent meta-analysis to produce {{an estimate of the}} global burden of ABPA complicating asthma. From 193 million asthma sufferers worldwide, ABPA prevalence in asthma is estimated between the extremes of 1.35–6.77 million sufferers, using 0.7–3.5% attrition rates. A compromise at 2.5% attrition has also been proposed, placing global burden at around 4.8 million people affected. The Eastern Mediterranean region had the lowest estimated prevalence, with a predicted case burden of 351,000; collectively, the Americas had the highest predicted burden at 1,461,000 cases. These are likely underestimates of total prevalence, given the exclusion of CF patients and children from the study, as well as diagnostic testing being limited in <b>less</b> <b>developed</b> <b>regions.</b>|$|E

The results show that the 'main factor of innovation ecosystem', 'the factor of resource constraints' and 'the environmental factor in innovation system' have positive influence on the healthy development of RTIE in this region. However, the factors of 'the environment of innovation policy' and 'the micro-market environment' have negative influence on the healthy development of the RTIE.

Since the incidence of AD increases with age, it is particularly important to include {{the mean age of}} the population of interest.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a {{political}} economy model for a <b>less</b> <b>developed</b> <b>region</b> where a significantly large number of people belonging to the informal sector depend on political favours for their survival due to ill-defined property rights. The purpose is to show that in such a scenario, democracy and political competition might lead to economic stagnation. Design/methodology/approach – The arguments in the paper are represented in terms of a theoretical model. Findings – The central result is that the party with a better political organization will have the incentive to maximize the size of the informal sector, which will also maximize its probability of winning. In equilibrium this party choosing anti-development policies will have a higher probability to be in power. Thus universal franchise may lead to inefficiencies in such economies. These inefficiencies stem from ill-defined property rights in the informal sector.

It is very interesting that belonging to the South (respect to the North), a <b>less</b> <b>developed</b> <b>region,</b> increases the probability of being in category 2 (always compared to transference 1).
