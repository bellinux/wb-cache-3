In the meantime, Vettel had moved up into third place, right behind his teammate Räikkönen. Hamilton came into the pitlane on lap 22, and problems with his stop saw him lose position to Rosberg. Räikkönen briefly led the race but followed suit one lap later and made a pit stop, only to come out behind both Red Bull drivers. More trouble was ahead for Ferrari, as Vettel, who was in the lead at that point, retired on lap 27, when he crashed into the barriers after his rear right tyre had exploded. This incident sent the safety car out, bringing the field back together. Rosberg was now leading the race from Hamilton, Verstappen, Ricciardo and Räikkönen.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} exposing liquid-stored boar semen to different red light LED regimens on sperm quality and reproductive performance. Of all of the tested photo-stimulation procedures, the best pattern consisted of 10 [*]min light, 10 [*]min rest and 10 [*]min of further light (10 - 10 - 10 pattern). This pattern induced an intense and transient increase {{in the majority of}} motility parameters, without modifying sperm viability and acrosome integrity. While incubating non-photo-stimulated sperm at 37 [*]°C for 90 [*]min decreased all sperm quality parameters, this reduction was prevented when the previously-described <b>light</b> <b>procedure</b> was applied. This effect was concomitant with an increase in the percentage of sperm with high mitochondrial membrane potential. When sperm were subjected to ‘in vitro’ capacitation, photo-stimulation also increased the percentage of sperm with capacitation-like changes in membrane structure. On the other hand, treating commercial semen doses intended for artificial insemination with the 10 - 10 - 10 photo-stimulation pattern significantly increased farrowing rates and the number of both total and live-born piglets for parturition. Therefore, our results indicate that a precise photo-stimulation procedure is able to increase the fertilising ability of boar sperm via a mechanism that could be related to mitochondrial functionThis research received support from Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Grant AGL 2013 - 47798 -P...|$|E

40|$|Flow chemistry, {{the basis}} of {{petrochemical}} and bulk chemicals industry, has recently found various applications in fine chemicals production and discovery chemistry {{with the development of}} commercially available laboratory equipment. Due to the precise control of the reaction parameters, the potential for automation and sequencing of reactions, the in situ analysis and for safety reasons the development of this novel technology has proven to make significant impact within organic chemistry. By taking advantage of the potential of flow chemistry, the optimisation of difficult batch reactions involved in the total synthesis of epicocconone analogues, and the in situ generation of isocyanides were attempted. However, some limitations such as solubility issues and formation of insoluble species made the optimisations complicated. Then, activation energies and reaction rate constants were determined from the thermolysis of 1, 3 -dioxin- 4 -ones by means of in situ analysis (UV and IR) and by using conventional and novel kinetic study methods. Good consistency was observed between both procedures. The significant gain in time and the lower consumption of material were the main advantages of this novel methodology which {{can be used as a}} reliable tool to accelerate reaction study and process development. Finally, the flow platform was employed to develop optimisation of reaction methodologies by using the dispersion effect and the “turn off” light concept. Thermolysis of 1, 3 -dioxin- 4 -one, Diels-Alder reaction, [2 + 2] photocycloaddition, photocyclisation and SRN 1 reactions were used as models for the development of these two methodologies. The determination of the rate constant of both 1 st and 2 nd order reactions, the determination of the optimum amount of reagent and the determination of the optimum concentration of starting material were achieved with the dispersion effect methodology. Then, the “turn off” <b>light</b> <b>procedure</b> was developed to rapidly determine the optimum reaction time. Consistent results were obtained for both new methodologies...|$|E
30|$|Introduction Sleep and {{wakefulness}} {{are strong}} interconnected stages regulated by complex mechanism in the basal brain. Disturbed sleep impairs function of nervous and immune systems and metabolism.

Several studies reveal pathological sleep patterns in critically ill patients. Critically ill patients in the busy environment of an ICU are exposed {{to a range of}} different disturbances such as the high level of noise and <b>light,</b> <b>procedures,</b> mechanical ventilation, medication, and the critical illness itself.Polysomnography (PSG) has never been used in studies on critically ill patients in an ICU to test whether environmental changes improve sleep in this patient group.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Meat-type pullets of two strains, {{housed in}} {{windowless}} floor pens, {{were subjected to}} two stimulation lighting treatments beginning at 140 days of age. The treatments provided increases in photoperiod from 6 to 16 hr/day by either 1) 5 increases of 2 hr/day each week or 2) increases each of 2 and 1 hr/day followed by 14 increases of. 5 hr/day each week. Overall, {{there was no significant}} difference due to lighting treatment in number of hatching eggs per hen housed. However, age at 50 % production was 6. 3 days less; percentage hen day egg produc-tion was higher, 56. 2 vs. 54. 2; and egg weight was. 8 g lower for hens of Treatment 1 vs. Treatment 2. For the strain with lower egg size, the number of additional eggs obtained for Treatment 1 was no greater than losses due to undersized eggs. For the strain with higher egg size, Treatment 1 prevented excess body weight gain and permitted earlier egg production.

40|$|Dietary factors {{contribute}} to ammonia emission and amount of nitrogen in the excreta. The excretion of nitrogen originating from dietary protein is largely responsible {{for some of the}} environmental issues associated with poultry production. Protein is essential as the very building block of the animal itself and hence protein nutrition takes a centre stage in poultry feeding. The use of dietary crude protein with crystalline amino acids as a means to decrease the impact on the environment of intensive poultry production is consequently of importance. Two experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of dietary manipulation using four different concentration of protein with and without amino acid supplementation on turkey performance, litter quality and nutrient utilization. The birds were raised in an environmentally controlled house and <b>lighting</b> <b>procedure</b> followed was the recommendation for the turkey breed.

50|$|Coulthard {{was forced}} to use his spare car, set up for Hill, for the race itself after he spun off the track during his {{reconnaissance}} lap. He stalled the engine in the process. The race was scheduled to start at 14:00 CET, but Papis stalled his Footwork car in the starting <b>lights</b> <b>procedure,</b> resulting in the start being aborted. A new start time of 14:05 CET was planned. Many of the teams started the race with wet weather tyres, but the Ferrari and McLaren teams chose to fit their cars with dry weather slick tyres. The Ferrari mechanics also raised the ride height and increased the downforce levels on Alesi and Berger's cars on the grid, making them more competitive in the wet conditions. Coulthard, from pole position on the grid, held onto the lead into the first corner. Hill, who started alongside Coulthard, had a bad start and was overtaken by Schumacher in the run down to the first corner. Irvine also got past Hill, but was repassed by the Williams driver during the first lap. Further down the order, Frentzen was judged to have jumped the start, while Papis took up his normal grid position instead of starting from the back as {{he should have done}} after stalling: both were given ten-second stop-and-go penalties {{in the early stages of}} the race for these misdemeanours.
