5|$|Casting for {{the episode}} was difficult, as the {{production}} team wanted real Africans. They auditioned every one they could find, including an African theater troupe that was passing by. The role of Marcus Duff eventually went to Carl Lumbly, {{who was known}} for his role on CBS's Cagney & Lacey. The role of Aboah went to Willie Amakye, a Ghanaian Olympic runner who had just returned to his home in Southern California from the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. To appear albino, Amakye's skin underwent several layers of cover-up cream, layers of white powder, and a <b>little</b> <b>pink</b> powder for color. He also wore contacts for the transparent pink eyes. Amakye's hair was dyed orange for post-production special effects to change it back and forth from black and white. As revealed on his resident alien card, Aboah's birthday is September 25, a reference to the birthday of Gillian Anderson's daughter.|$|E
25|$|In February 2014, Double Fine, and the Humble Bundle group began another charity drive titled Amnesia Fortnight 2014. During this drive, {{those that}} paid {{a minimum of}} $1 had the {{opportunity}} to vote on 29 concept ideas. In addition, those that paid more than the average will get to vote on a concept idea for a prototype led by Pendleton Ward, the creator of Adventure Time. After the completion of the voting period, Double Fine developed the top voted ideas into game prototypes that were available for those that purchased the bundle. As with Amnesia Fortnight 2012, 2 Player Productions filmed the production of the prototype, which was available to people who purchased the bundle, as well as on a Blu-ray, along with the prototypes on a DVD, for those who paid a minimum of $35. The four pitches that were made into prototypes for Amnesia Fortnight 2014 were Dear Leader, an emergent narrative game led by Anna Kipnis, <b>Little</b> <b>Pink</b> Best Buds, a game about <b>little</b> <b>pink</b> creatures who want to be your friend led by Pendleton Ward, Mnemonic, a surreal, first-person noir adventure led by Derek Brand, and Steed, a game set in a storybook land full of inept heroes led by John Bernhelm. One idea, Bad Golf 2, was not selected as a prototype, but a group of Double Fine fans have started working on developing the title themselves, with the blessing of its conceptor, Patrick Hackett and permission of Double Fine.|$|E
500|$|After {{two days}} of being {{available}} on YouTube, the video garnered 2.2 million views. Upon release, the music video for [...] "Dear Future Husband" [...] received negative reviews from critics, receiving criticism for gender stereotypes. Kelly Lawler of USA Today wrote, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} gender stereotypes. There is a very, very catchy melody", and compared the nature of the video to that of Taylor Swift's music video for [...] "Blank Space" [...] (2014). The video received accusations of sexism, and backlash from feminists. In a negative review of the video, Julia Shumway of State Press wrote, [...] "The video calls back to a romanticized version of the 1950s or '60s, featuring a yellow version of a <b>little</b> <b>pink</b> house, complete with gramophone and groovy colors". MTV News' Christina Garibaldi criticized the video, writing [...] "the video depicts Meghan going back to the 1950s, scrubbing floors and working hard in the kitchen". Trainor responded to the criticism of the video, saying, [...] "Just surprised the random places people are asking me if I was being sexist. But no, I donâ€™t believe I was." ...|$|E

Confused, and unhappy, he gathered the strewn flowers; and not till he had collected every one did he get up and shyly take them to her, where she still stood, gazing into the depths of the larch-wood.|$|R
