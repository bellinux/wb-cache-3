[...] Gibbs's analysis of irreversibility, and his formulation of Boltzmann's H-theorem and of the ergodic hypothesis, were major influences on the mathematical physics of the 20th century.|$|E

[...] Exclaim! noted that [...] "songs like [...] "Hover Traps," [...] "Death Mountain" [...] and [...] "All Nite" [...] are, at their core, extremely primitive.

500|$|Innocence R {{was also}} well {{received}} by Famitsu. General praise to the graphical upgrade over the original version, the rebuilt battle system and added voice acting and story content. Japanese website Game Impress Watch was highly positive, praising the extra characters, updated gameplay and graphics. One minor reservation {{was that some}} aspects might be a <b>little</b> <b>difficult</b> or complex for players. The reviewer's closing comment {{was that it was}} a role-playing game they would [...] "recommend to anyone". Abraham Ashton Liu of RPGFan was fairly mixed about some aspects of it. While he found aspects of comparing the characters' past and present lives and enjoyed the gameplay and side-characters, he generally found the lead characters irritating. He also found the graphics rather poor for the Vita and saw some gameplay elements as archaic or poorly tuned. In March 2013, Famitsu ranked the top games of 2012, and Innocence R reached 13th place. In July 2014, Innocence R was ranked by Japanese website Inside Games among the top ten popular role-playing games for the Vita.|$|E
500|$|Metroid Prime 3: Corruption {{received}} critical acclaim. Nintendo Power commented, [...] "The stunning visuals and immersive gameplay of {{the finale}} to the Prime series {{proves that the}} Wii {{is ready for the}} mainstream gamer." [...] IGN awarded the game an Editor's Choice Award, and noted that the game was beautifully designed and the best looking game for the Wii. They also praised the inclusion of [...] "well-done" [...] voice acting, in contrast to the lack of any voice acting in most other Nintendo games. Despite stating that Metroid Prime 3 was too similar to its predecessors, the review concluded that it was the best game in the Prime trilogy. IGN also said that it could be worthy of the same score as the original Metroid Prime (9.8), {{had it not been for}} the aforementioned reason. X-Play claimed that the game was enjoyable, but it had a few awkward control mechanics and was a <b>little</b> <b>difficult</b> to control on the Wii. They also said that although it was fun, there were problems that lead to odd lock-on mechanics and painful wrists from continuous motions.|$|E
500|$|Walton's {{works of}} the 1920s, while {{he was living in}} the Sitwells' attic, include the {{overture}} Portsmouth Point, dedicated to Sassoon and inspired by the well-known painting of the same name by Thomas Rowlandson. It was first heard as an entr'acte at a performance in Diaghilev's 1926 ballet season, where The Times complained, [...] "It is a <b>little</b> <b>difficult</b> to make much of new music when it is heard through the hum of conversation." [...] Sir Henry Wood programmed the work at the Proms the following year, where it made more of an impression. The composer conducted this performance; he did not enjoy conducting, but he had firm views on how his works should be interpreted, and orchestral players appreciated his [...] "easy nonchalance" [...] and [...] "complete absence of fuss." [...] Walton's other {{works of the}} 1920s included a short orchestral piece, Siesta (1926) and a Sinfonia Concertante for piano and orchestra (1928), which was well received at its premiere at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert, but has not entered the regular repertory.|$|E

Keith Phipps of The A.V.

IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode as 8.5 out of 10, finding that the [...] "only downside" [...] was that [...] "it felt less a tale about the Daleks than an adventure that just happened to have them in it". Maureen Ryan, writing for The Huffington Post, felt it was a [...] "ripping start to the season" [...] that redeemed the Daleks from [...] "Victory of the Daleks". While she commended Gillan and Darvill's acting during Amy and Rory's emotional confrontation, she noted that they were not a couple that would break up because of infertility.|$|E

2500|$|Allison's V-1710 engines {{produced}} [...] at {{sea level}} and [...] This was not powerful compared with contemporary fighters, and the early P-40 variants' top speeds were only average. The single-stage, single-speed supercharger meant that the P-40 was a poor high-altitude fighter. Later versions, with [...] Allisons or more powerful 1,400hp Packard Merlin engines were more capable. Climb performance was fair to poor, depending on the subtype. Dive acceleration was good and dive speed was excellent. The highest-scoring P-40 ace, Clive Caldwell (RAAF), who claimed 22 of his 28½ kills in the type, said that the P-40 had [...] "almost no vices", although [...] "it was a <b>little</b> <b>difficult</b> to control in terminal velocity".

2500|$|The fuselages of the Types 20 and 22 {{were similar}} flat-sided {{structures}} based on four cross-braced longerons, {{each of three}} parts. [...] Since {{the nose of the}} 22 did not terminate in a propeller, the high cockpit of the 20 was replaced with a blunt-nosed cabin, curved in planform, for the pilot. [...] Behind him the passenger seats in the Type 22 were in pairs, each with their own window. Boarding and disembarking were reported as a <b>little</b> <b>difficult.</b> The wing-mounted engines led to revised wing plans and structures. The Breguet 22 had equal-span, unstaggered wings of rectangular plan and three bays. [...] The innermost bay was defined by the engine by the engine mountings, which placed the U.16s with their four-blade tractor propellers on multiple struts midway between the two wings. Radiators were mounted {{on the sides of the}} engine cowling. [...] The outer bays were formed by single interplane struts with forked junctions into the wings, assisted by cross-bracing. [...] At the rear the tail was, like that of the Type 20, quite small and conventional with the tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage but now carrying a pair of small additional fins. [...] The landing gear was also conventional, with each fixed mainwheel mounted on a pair of substantial V-form legs from the wing spars under the inner bay.|$|E
2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a <b>little</b> <b>difficult</b> to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
