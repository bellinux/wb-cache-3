500|$|From {{the text}} itself, the ending is ambiguous: {{according}} to one view, Batman breaks the Joker's neck out of panel, causing the laughter to stop abruptly. Some people theorise that the title, [...] "The Killing Joke" [...] is {{in reference to the}} ending scene, in which The Joker and Batman laugh, over a joke, thus triggering Batman to kill The Joker. According to another view, Batman and the Joker, who have been fighting for years, end all of their disputes by having a good <b>laugh</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> all. Still another theory maintains that the first and last panels of the book are both purposely of rain falling on the ground, which symbolizes that nothing has changed except for the two parties' respect for each other.|$|E
500|$|The jury {{returned}} guilty verdicts for {{all eight}} defendants. Before being sentenced, Neebe {{told the court}} that Schaack's officers were among the city's worst gangs, ransacking houses and stealing money and watches. Schaack laughed and Neebe retorted, [...] "You need not <b>laugh</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Captain Schaack. You are one of them. You are an anarchist, as you understand it. You are all anarchists, in this sense of the word, I must say." [...] Judge Gary sentenced seven of the defendants to death by hanging and Neebe to 15 years in prison. The sentencing provoked outrage from labor and workers' movements and their supporters, resulting in protests around the world, and elevating the defendants {{to the status of}} martyrs, especially abroad. Portrayals of the anarchists as bloodthirsty foreign fanatics in the press along with the 1889 publication of Captain Schaack's sensational account, Anarchy and Anarchism, on the other hand, inspired widespread public fear and revulsion against the strikers and general anti-immigrant feeling, polarizing public opinion.|$|E

Haas made advances towards Garcia, at one point forcefully kissing her and then dropping her to the ground. Haas and Viscera continued to fight for Garcia's affection in the ring, until she told them both that she wanted to be [...] "just friends". Haas gave Viscera an eye rake in anger, and a blinded Viscera accidentally gave Garcia a Samoan drop. Though it was unintentional, when both Haas and Viscera had seen what had happened to their now former love interest, they simply had a <b>laugh</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> thus making Haas a villain. After that, Viscera and Haas became a tag team, competing on both Raw and Heat until splitting in December 2006.|$|E

2500|$|The words [...] "down" [...] and [...] "up", {{according}} to Fuller, are awkward {{in that they}} refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience.

[...] "I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going [...] "outstairs" [...] and [...] "instairs."'

2500|$|Two {{tours of}} the USA {{followed}} in support of Kiln House, but the second, in early 1971, was blighted by Spencer's bizarre departure from the group, when he disappeared one afternoon in Los Angeles, and was later discovered to have joined the religious cult the Children of God. After an uncomfortable time finishing the tour, during which Peter Green was asked {{to come back and}} help out, Californian Bob Welch was recruited to replace Spencer, without an audition as such, after a brief period getting to know the band. Welch's contrasting attitudes towards Kirwan, on the one hand their difficult personal relationship, and on the other, Welch's respect for Kirwan's musicianship, were a point of focus during the 18 months they were together in Fleetwood Mac. In 1999, Welch stated: [...] "He was a talented, gifted musician, almost equal to Pete Green in his beautiful guitar playing and faultless string bends." [...] In a later interview, Welch said: [...] "Danny wasn't a very lighthearted person, to say the least. He probably shouldn't have been drinking as much as he did, even at his young age... He was always very intense about his work, as I was, but he didn't seem to ever be able to distance himself from it... and <b>laugh</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Danny was the definition of 'deadly serious'." ...|$|E

The storyline was featured in a New Year's Eve episode that was filmed on-location in Scotland. In the storyline, a group of teenagers travel from London to Scotland for New Year's Eve, but their minibus crashes, leaving them stranded and injured on the freezing cold Scottish moors. While stranded, Kelly cares for an injured Zoe, they become over-emotional, and kiss. Kinsella explained the reasons behind the kiss: [...] "They're stuck in the hills, thinking they're going to die—it's {{a way of saying}} goodbye and also of showing how much they love each other as friends. Which is quite sweet really." [...] She claimed that the kiss was made easier {{due to the fact that}} she was kissing her off-screen best friend: [...] "That made it so much easier. We thought we were just going to be laughing and giggling the whole way through, but we were very professional. It was so cold that we just wanted to get it over with. We were shaking from cold—not from nerves—and it was raining, so we just thought, 'Let's do it and get it done with'. [...] We <b>laugh</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> now.
