Along with {{the absence of}} exterior door handles, the vehicle lacks side windows and a roof. Although a soft top cover was available, it was designed primarily for indoor vehicle storage.

The battery {{is located in the}} sealed compartment over the rear wheels to increase rear-end weight and traction. The car shipped with a tonneau cover and video tape on soft-top assembly (the soft top is removable and folds to fit in the trunk).

40|$|Study Design. A {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis {{of studies on}} the putative mechanisms of action of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> in lifting activities. Objective. To summarize the evidence bearing on the putative mechanisms of action of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports.</b> Summary of Background Data. A restriction of trunk motion {{and a reduction in}} required back muscle forces in lifting are two proposed mechanisms of action of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports.</b> Available studies on these putative mechanisms of action of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> have reported contradictory results. Methods. A literature search for controlled studies on mechanisms of action of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> was conducted. The methodologic quality of the studies was assessed. The evidence for the two proposed mechanisms of action of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> was determined in meta-analyses. Results. Thirty-three studies were selected for the review. There was evidence that <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> reduce trunk motion for flexion-extension and lateral bending, with overall effect sizes of 0. 70 (95 % confidence interval [Cl] 0. 39 - 1. 01) and 1. 13 (95 % Cl 0. 17 - 2. 08), respectively. The overall effect size for rotation was not statistically significant (0. 69; 95 % Cl - 0. 40 - 4. 31). There was no evidence that <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> reduce the electromyogram activity of erector spinae muscles (effect size of 0. 09; 95 % Cl - 0. 41 - 0. 59) or increase the intra-abdominal pressure (effect size of 0. 26; 95 % Cl - 0. 07 - 0. 59). Conclusion. There is evidence that <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> reduce trunk motion for flexion-extension and latera bending. More research is needed on the separate outcome measures for trunk motion before definite conclusions can be drawn about the work conditions in which <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> may be most effective. Studies of trunk motion at the workplace or during specified lifting tasks would be especially useful in this regard...|$|R

The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> for prevention and treatment of non-specific low back pain. We searched the Medline, Cinahl and Current Contents databases and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register up to September 1999, and the Embase database up to September 1998. We also screened references given in relevant reviews and identified controlled trials, and used Science Citation Index to identify additional controlled trials. Controlled clinical trials that reported on any type of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> as preventive or therapeutic intervention for non-specific low back pain were included. One reviewer extracted data from the trials considering characteristics of the study population, characteristics of the interventions and the final results for each outcome measure. The reviewer compared these findings to data regarding the same characteristics of the same studies published already in other reviews. The methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers. Because {{it was not possible to}} perform a quantitative analysis, a qualitative meta-analysis was performed in which the strength of evidence on the effectiveness of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> was classified as being strong, moderate, limited or conflicting, and no evidence. Five randomized and two nonrandomized controlled preventive trials and six randomized therapeutic trials were included in our review.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports,</b> education, and exercise {{in the prevention of}} back pain in industry. METHODS: A computerised search for controlled clinical trials was conducted. A criteria list was used to assess the methodological quality of the studies. The available evidence for {{the effectiveness of}} the interventions was graded with a rating system for the level of evidence. Effect sizes of individual studies were combined if the studies were sufficiently similar. RESULTS: 11 studies were identified for the review. The methodological quality of all studies was low, with a maximum score of three out of seven for internal validity. There was no evidence for the effectiveness of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> due to contradictory outcomes of the studies. Five of the six studies on education reported no effect. Thus there is limited evidence that education does not help to prevent back pain. All three studies on exercise reported a positive result, indicating limited evidence for the effectiveness of exercise. The combined effect size for exercise was 0. 53, which is a medium sized effect. CONCLUSIONS: Although widely used, there is little evaluative research on the preventive measures studied here. The review showed that there is limited evidence that exercise has some effect in the prevention of back pain and that education is not effective. No conclusive evidence was found for or against the effectiveness of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports.</b> Research of higher methodological quality is needed before firm conclusions on the effectiveness of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports,</b> education, and exercise in the prevention of back pain in industry can be drawn...|$|R

40|$|Objective. Assess the eect of dierent {{controlled}} <b>lumbar</b> back <b>support</b> tightness {{levels on}} trunk muscle activity. Design. Two-way repeated measure design assessing <b>lumbar</b> back <b>support</b> tension and submaximal trunk extension moments on trunk muscle electromyographic activity. Background. Biomechanical studies on <b>lumbar</b> back <b>supports</b> often use electromyography (EMG) {{to assess the}} aect on trunk muscle activity. However, the <b>lumbar</b> back <b>support</b> may alter the electromyographic signal by changing the electrode–muscle distance. Methods. Subjects performed trunk extensions at three static submaximal extension moment levels (25 %, 50 % and 75 % MVC) while stabilized at the hips and shoulders, with the back support tensioned to three dierent tightness levels (44. 5, 66. 7 and 89. 0 N) {{as well as a}} no-back support condition. Results. Statistical analysis failed to find a significant eect (P 6 0 : 05) of <b>lumbar</b> back <b>support</b> tension on the average normalized EMG across the 10 trunk muscles sampled. Conclusions. For static experimental tasks, as long as electrodes are protected from direct contact with the back support, studies assessing the eect of <b>lumbar</b> back <b>supports</b> on the trunk muscles via EMG during static tasks are not subject to confounding due to dierences in tensions across subjects. Relevance The {{results of this study suggest}} that variable tensions from previous studies for static exertions with <b>lumbar</b> back <b>supports</b> do not significantly alter the pick-up volume of protected electrodes.
