50|$|An {{example that}} {{illustrates}} {{the difference between}} SP and Stasis Papillomatosis and the histology diagnosis is … “a markedly obese, 41-year-old Japanese man who had suffered from psoriasis vulgaris for several years visited hospital with elephantiasis-like swelling of his lower legs of three months' duration. His right lower leg showed marked papillomatosis with thick scales, and the left lower leg was eroded and papillomatous. Although direct <b>lymphography</b> of his lower extremities showed no abnormality, indirect <b>lymphography</b> revealed local lymphatic damage in the involved skin”. Histological examination showed hyperkeratosis, marked papillomatosis, proliferation of capillaries in the upper dermis, and lymphectasia in the lower dermis.

5000|$|Sentinel {{lymph node}} biopsy (SLB or SLN biopsy) allows selective, {{minimally}} invasive access for assessment of the regional lymph node status with malignant tumours. The first draining lymph note, the [...] "sentinel", represents an existing or non-existing tumour of an entire lymph node region. The method has been validated using radionuclides and/or blue dye for breast cancer, malignant melanoma and also gastrointestinal tumours and gives a good detection rate and sensitivity. For the SLB, a reduced mortality has been observed in comparison with complete lymph node dissection, but the methods have disadvantages with regard to availability, application and disposal of the radionuclide {{and the risk of}} anaphylaxis (up to 1%) for the blue dye. ICG, because of its near-infrared fluorescence and previous toxicity investigations, was evaluated in this investigation as a new, alternative method for SLB with regard to the clinical application of the transcutaneous navigation and lymph vessel visualisation and SLN detection. This technique is sometimes referred as fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS). ICG fluorescence navigation achieves high rates of detection and sensitivity in comparison with the conventional methods. Taking into account the learning curve required, the new, alternative method offers a combination of <b>lymphography</b> and SLB and the possibility of carrying out an SLB without the need for radioactive substances for solitary tumours ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Preoperative {{identification}} of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in gastric cancer (GC) patients may have great advantages for the minimally invasive treatment. This study was performed to evaluate the possibility of preoperative SLN detection using CT <b>lymphography.</b> Materials and Methods: Fourteen patients with early GC were enrolled. CT images were obtained before and at 1, 3, and 5 minutes after endoscopic submucosal peritumoral injection of 2 mL iopamidol. For patients with clearly identified SLNs, to make comparisons with the CT <b>lymphography</b> results, intraoperative SLN detection was performed using subserosally injected Indocyanine green (ICG) <b>lymphography</b> and ex vivo ICG and iopamidol <b>lymphography</b> using mammography was also performed. Results: CT <b>lymphography</b> clearly visualized draining lymphatics and SLNs in 4 (28. 6 %) out of 14 patients. All clearly visualized SLNs (one to three SLNs per patient) under preoperative imaging were detected in the same location by intraoperative ICG <b>lymphography</b> and ex vivo ICG and iopamidol <b>lymphography</b> using mammography. All preoperative SLN detections were observed with the primary tumors in the lower third of the stomach. Conclusion: Although our study demonstrated a SLN detection rate of less than 30 %, CT <b>lymphography</b> with radio-contrast showed potential {{as a method of}} preoperative SLN detection for GC...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the feasibility of detecting sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases using interstitial magnetic resonance (MR) <b>lymphography</b> in patients with cervical cancer. MR data were compared to pathological results from the lymph nodes excised during surgery. Methods Twenty-eight patients with cervical cancer were enrolled and studied from January 2006 to December 2010. All patients underwent interstitial MR <b>lymphography</b> to determine the presence of sentinel lymph nodes and visualize lymphatic vessel drainage in the pelvis. Radical hysterectomy and excision of pelvic lymph nodes was performed according to their lesion grade. Gadodiamide was injected either intradermally into the bipedal toe web, into the labia majora or into the cervical tissue. MR results were compared with pathological reports. Results In 28 patients, lymphatic vessel drainage and lymph node groups were clearly visualized. Of these, 5 were MR <b>lymphography</b> positive and 23 were MR <b>lymphography</b> negative. Six had pathologically proven metastasis, five had true positives and 1 had a false negative in the obturator lymph node. Conclusions Interstitial MR <b>lymphography</b> can be used to determine the extent and shape of pelvic lymphatic vessel drainage and lymph node metastases in patients with cervical cancer. </p...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To apply a {{decision}} analytic model {{to determine whether}} the addition of magnetic resonance (MR) <b>lymphography</b> to the diagnostic workup of patients with intermediate or high probability of lymph node metastases is cost effective from a health care perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data that were used for the decision analytic model were obtained from an empiric study population of 375 patients. As the input of the decision analytic model was made given prospective patient data from several hospitals, the ethics review board of each hospital approved the study. Written consent was obtained from all patients. To investigate possible differences between strategies that utilize MR <b>lymphography</b> and those that do not (pelvic lymph node dissection [PLND]), two outcome measures were examined and combined in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of health care resources consumed and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The PLND strategy is dominated by the MR <b>lymphography</b> strategy. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that in 63 % of simulations, MR <b>lymphography</b> was cost saving and resulted in better patient outcome for patients with prostate cancer and intermediate or high probability of lymph node metastases. The probability of MR <b>lymphography</b> being inferior (more expensive and worse patient outcome) is less than 3 %. CONCLUSION: MR <b>lymphography</b> is an efficient strategy in the detection of lymph node metastases of prostate cancer when compared with the PLND strategy...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesIndocyanine green (ICG) <b>lymphography</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to be useful for the evaluation of secondary lymphedema, but no study has reported characteristic findings of ICG <b>lymphography</b> in primary lymphedema. This study aimed to classify characteristic ICG <b>lymphography</b> patterns in primary lymphedema. MethodsThe study was a retrospective observational study. Thirty one primary lower extremity lymphedema (LEL) patients with a total of 62 legs were studied. ICG <b>lymphography</b> patterns were categorized according to the visibility of lymphatics and dermal backflow (DB) extension. Clinical demographics were compared with categorized ICG <b>lymphography</b> patterns. ResultsAll symptomatic legs showed abnormal patterns, and all asymptomatic legs showed normal patterns on ICG <b>lymphography.</b> Abnormal lymphographic patterns could be classified into proximal DB (PDB), distal DB (DDB), less enhancement (LE), and no enhancement (NE) patterns. There were significant differences between PDB (16 patients), DDB (6 patients), LE (4 patients), and NE patterns (5 patients) in age (37. 3  ±  18. 3 vs. 61. 8  ±  19. 2 vs. 50. 8  ±  27. 7 vs. 29. 2  ±  18. 0 years, p = . 035), onset of edema (23. 9  ±  19. 4 vs. 46. 8  ±  27. 0 vs. 43. 0  ±  31. 3 vs. 6. 6  ±  14. 2 years, p = . 020), laterality (bilateral; 18. 8 % vs. 66. 7 % vs. 75. 0 % vs. 0 %, p = . 016), cellulitis history (56. 3 % vs. 100 % vs. 25. 0 % vs. 0 %, p = . 007), and LEL index (292. 2  ±  32. 8 vs. 254. 2  ±  28. 6 vs. 243. 3  ±  9. 4 vs. 295. 2  ±  44. 8, p = . 016).

40|$|PURPOSE: To prospectively {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with ferumoxtran- 10 in patients with prostate cancer to depict lymph node metastases outside the routine pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study {{was approved by the}} institutional review boards at all four hospitals; patients provided written informed consent. Two hundred ninety-six consecutive men (mean age, 67 years; range, 47 - 83 years) with prostate cancer and an intermediate-to-high risk for nodal metastases (prostate-specific antigen level > 10 ng/mL, Gleason score > 6, or stage T 3 disease) were enrolled. MR <b>lymphography</b> of the pelvis was performed 24 hours after intravenous drip infusion of ferumoxtran- 10. Positive nodes at MR <b>lymphography</b> were indicated to be inside or outside the routine dissection area (RDA). On the basis of MR <b>lymphography</b> computed tomographic (CT) -guided biopsy, routine PLND, or MR imaging-guided minimal extended PLND was performed. RESULTS: MR <b>lymphography</b> findings were positive in 58 patients. Of these, 44 had histopathologic confirmation of lymph node metastases. In 18 of 44 patients (41 %), MR <b>lymphography</b> findings showed nodes exclusively outside the RDA, which were confirmed with MR lymphography-guided extended PLND (n = 13) and CT-guided biopsy (n = 5). In another 18 patients (41 %), positive nodes were located {{both inside and outside the}} RDA at MR <b>lymphography.</b> In these 18 patients, routine PLND was used to confirm the nodes inside the RDA (n = 11); CT-guided biopsy was used to confirm nodes outside the RDA (n = 7). In the remaining eight patients, MR <b>lymphography</b> findings showed only nodes inside the RDA, which was confirmed with PLND (n = 5) and CT-guided biopsy (n = 3). In 14 of the 58 patients (24 %), there was no histologic confirmation.

40|$|Background: Visualisation of the {{lymphatic system}} is a {{challenging}} task. Recently, an indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent <b>lymphography</b> system was developed for visualising the lymphatic vessels. ICG emits energy in the near-infrared region between 840 and 850 nm when it is bound to protein in the tissue. Aim: To use ICG fluorescent <b>lymphography</b> to identify locations of the lymphatic vessel for lymphovenous shunt. Methods: The lymphatic anatomy in the upper extremity was investigated using ICG fluorescent <b>lymphography</b> in 3 healthy volunteers and 15 patients with breast cancer-related lymphoedema prior to them undergoing lymphaticovenular bypass. Results: In healthy volunteers, fluorescent images of lymphatic vessels emerged at the dorsal hand as a shiny linear pattern and ran longitudinally towards the proximal arm after a few minutes. In lymphoedema patients, the lymphatic vessels could be identified at the dorsal hand, but {{the appearance of the}} lymphatic structure varied between patients. Conclusions: ICG fluorescent <b>lymphography</b> allows for the prompt identification of the lymphatic vessels and has the potential to improve the outcomes of lymphovenous shunt operations and for use as a diagnostic tool. 5 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Background: Secondary {{lymphedema}} causes {{swelling in}} limbs due to lymph retention following lymph node dissection in cancer therapy. Initiation of treatment soon after appearance of edema is very important, {{but there is}} no method for early diagnosis of lymphedema. In this study, we compared the utility of four diagnostic imaging methods: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), lymphoscintigraphy, and Indocyanine Green (ICG) <b>lymphography.</b> Patients and Methods: Between April 2010 and November 2011, we examined 21 female patients (42 arms) with unilateral mild upper limb lymphedema using the four methods. The mean age of the patients was 60. 4 years old (35 – 81 years old). Biopsies of skin and collecting lymphatic vessels were performed in 7 patients who underwent lymphaticovenous anastomosis. Results: The specificity was 1 for all four methods. The sensitivity was 1 in ICG <b>lymphography</b> and MRI, 0. 62 in lymphoscintigraphy, and 0. 33 in CT. These results show that MRI and ICG <b>lymphography</b> are superior to lymphoscintigraphy or CT for diagnosis of lymphedema. In some cases, biopsy findings suggested abnormalities in skin and lymphatic vessels for which lymphoscintigraphy showed no abnormal findings.
