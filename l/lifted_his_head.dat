500|$|On Christmas Day, Brigadier-General Walter Congreve, then {{commanding}} 18 Infantry Brigade, stationed near Neuve Chapelle, wrote {{a letter}} recalling the Germans initiated by calling a truce for the day. [...] One of his brigade's men bravely <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> above the parapet and others from both sides walked onto no man's land. [...] Officers and men shook hands and exchanged cigarettes and cigars, one of his captains [...] "smoked a cigar with the best shot in the German army", the latter no more than 18 years old. [...] Congreve admitted {{he was reluctant to}} personally witness the scene of the truce for fear he would be a prime target for German snipers.|$|E
500|$|Greene {{and middle}} linebacker Jack Lambert became the {{emotional}} leaders of Pittsburgh's defensive squad. Greene {{was described as}} a huge presence {{both on and off the}} field. Once, in the locker room, a teammate was loudly voicing his discontent over the long and cold practice they had just gone through as he yanked off his equipment. At a nearby locker, Greene <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and silently glared at him. [...] "Believe me, that's all Joe did, he never even said anything," [...] Joe Gordon of the Steelers front office recalled. [...] "I don't think the other players saw Joe glare at him. I think the other player just felt it, and then he sat down and never said another word." [...] A natural leader, Greene was named the captain of the defense in 1977. His leadership was also channeled to the offense; Lynn Swann, a wide receiver, considered Greene a mentor. [...] "If you were giving less than 100 percent, he let you know one way or the other," [...] said Swann.|$|E
