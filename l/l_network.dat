5000|$|For the {{resistance}} Rs and reactance Xs in series, Rp and Xp {{exist as a}} parallel combination. One simply needs to know the input impedance Rp and to choose the output impedance Rs. Or conversely know Rs and choose Rp. Keep in mind that Rp must be larger than Rs. Because reactance is frequency dependent the <b>L</b> <b>network</b> will only transform the impedances at one frequency.|$|E
50|$|This {{is called}} an <b>L</b> <b>network</b> {{not because it}} {{contains}} an inductor, (in fact some L-networks consist of two capacitors), but because the two components are {{at right angles to}} each other, having the shape of a rotated and sometimes reversed English letter ‘L’. The T (“Tee”) network and the π (“Pi”) network also have a shape similar to the English and Greek letters they are named after.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>L</b> <b>network</b> {{relies on}} a {{procedure}} known as [...] series-parallel transformation. For every series combination of resistance, RS, and reactance, XS, there exists a parallel combination of RP and XP that acts identically to the voltage applied across the series combination. In other words, the series components and the parallel components provide the same impedance at their terminals. The transformation ratio is {{the ratio of the}} input and output impedances of the impedance matching network.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{expanded}} {{our previous}} work on <b>L</b> neural <b>networks</b> that used empirical magnetic field models as the underlying models by applying and extending our technique to drift shells calculated from a physics-based magnetic field model. While empirical magnetic field models represent an average, statistical magnetospheric state, the RAM-SCB model, a first-principles magnetically self-consistent code, computes magnetic fields based on fundamental equations of plasma physics. Unlike the previous <b>L</b> neural <b>networks</b> that include McIlwain L and mirror point magnetic field {{as part of}} the inputs, the new <b>L</b> neural <b>network</b> only requires solar wind conditions and the Dst index, allowing for an easier preparation of input parameters. This new neural network is compared against those previously trained networks and validated by the tracing method in the International Radiation Belt Environment Modeling (IRBEM) library.

There is, however, a problem that the representations of the neural networks are too complicated to estimate the capability of the assistant system in practical use.

40|$|Although a {{substantial}} amount of cross-cultural psychology research has investigated acculturative stress in general, little attention has been devoted specifically to communication-related acculturative stress (CRAS). In line with the view that cross-cultural adaptation and second language (L 2) learning are social and interpersonal phenomena, the present study examines the hypothesis that migrants' <b>L</b> 2 social <b>network</b> size and interconnectedness predict CRAS. The main idea underlying this hypothesis is that <b>L</b> 2 social <b>networks</b> {{play an important role in}} fostering social and cultural aspects of communicative competence. Specifically, higher interconnectedness may reflect greater access to unmodified natural cultural representations and L 2 communication practices, thus fostering communicative competence through observational learning. As such, structural aspects of migrants' <b>L</b> 2 social <b>networks</b> may be protective against acculturative stress arising from chronic communication difficulties. Results from a study of first generation migrant students (N = 100) support this idea by showing that both inclusiveness and density of the participants' <b>L</b> 2 <b>network</b> account for unique variance in CRAS but not in general acculturative stress. These results support the idea that research on cross-cultural adaptation would benefit from disentangling the various facets of acculturative stress and that the structure of migrants' <b>L</b> 2 <b>network</b> matters for language related outcomes. Finally, this study contributes to an emerging body of work that attempts to integrate cultural/cross-cultural research on acculturation and research on intercultural communication and second language learning...|$|R

The equation describing {{the effect of}} load impedance variation on the impedance matching performance is derived. The deviation from perfect match {{is proportional to the}} variation in load reflection coefficient. However, if the load impedance is too large or too small, resulting in a large reflection coefficient, the solution to the impedance matching problem will have poorer quality in term of variability. The variability factor increases rapidly when the load reflection coefficient is larger than 0. 7. A small variation in the load impedance will cause a large deviation from perfect match.

One issue of interest might be whether the <b>L</b> 2 <b>network</b> knowledge revealed in a WAF test is primarily {{a reflection of the}} knowledge in learners’ native language (i.e., L 1 in nature) or it is distinct from L 1. *Henriksen (2008) found the performance of Danish-speaking EFL learners at all three grade levels (i.e., Grades 7, 10, and 13) on an English word connection task was significantly less strong than that on a translated version of the task in Danish (i.e., L 1 task used the same format, target words, and choices of the L 2 task). More importantly, {{it was found that the}} correlations between the English and Danish tasks were all significant but small to medium in size (rs[*]=[*]. 623, [...]. 491, and [...]. 685 for the three grades, respectively). These correlations suggested that there was substantial difference, despite significant overlap, between the two languages; yet it remains unknown how much of the variance indeed pertained to a distinction between L 1 and <b>L</b> 2 <b>network</b> knowledge or whether the variance was primarily due to other factors (e.g., different language forms, as both tasks were administered in print). It is also unclear whether the variance may change as a function of the properties of the word connection task (e.g., word frequency) and L 2 proficiency. Hypothetically, for very frequent words and learners with advanced L 2 proficiency, there might be a high convergence between L 1 and <b>L</b> 2 <b>network.</b>|$|R
40|$|Osteoarthritis is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} and crippling joint disease, and lacks curative treatment, as the underlying molecular basis is unclear. Here, we show that DOT 1 L, an enzyme involved in histone methylation, is a master protector of cartilage health. Loss of DOT 1 L disrupts the molecular signature of healthy chondrocytes in vitro and causes osteoarthritis in mice. Mechanistically, the protective function of DOT 1 L is attributable to inhibition of Wnt signalling, a pathway that when hyper-activated can lead to joint disease. Unexpectedly, DOT 1 L suppresses Wnt signalling by inhibiting the activity of sirtuin- 1 (SIRT 1), an important regulator of gene transcription. Inhibition of SIRT 1 protects against osteoarthritis triggered by loss of DOT 1 L activity. Modulating the DOT 1 <b>L</b> <b>network</b> might therefore be a therapeutic approach to protect the cartilage against osteoarthritis. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Radiofrequency (RF) energy can be {{harvested}} {{in order to}} power autonomous sen-sors either from the surrounding environment or from dedicated sources. A conventional RF harvester is mainly composed by an antenna, a matching network and a rectifier. At low power levels, e. g., − 10 dBm and below, the corresponding voltage amplitude at the antenna is low and comparable to the {{voltage drop of the}} diodes used in the rectifier. In order to boost the voltage at the rectifier input and thus the rectifier efficiency, an L-network optimized for an input power of − 10 dBm at 868 MHz is proposed in this work. As for the rectifier, a half-wave rectifier with a single zero-bias Schottky diode (HSMS 2850) was selected. First, a theoretical analysis was performed followed by simulations with ADS (Harmonic Balance). Simulations show efficiencies of 75 % for an input power of − 10 dBm with ideal components but using the actual model of the diode rectifier. The incorporation of the PCB layout effects and the actual components decreases the efficiency to below 50 %. Finally, a PCB implementation was performed using a 0. 5 pF capac-itor and a 27 nH inductor for the <b>L</b> <b>network.</b> The input power was generated by an RF generator. The RF-to-DC efficiency was of 45 % at 868 MHz with an optimum load of 2. 5 kΩ. Efficiencies of 34. 5 % and 22. 5 % were achieved at − 15 dBm and − 20 dBm, respectively. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—While {{the desire}} to use {{commodity}} parts in the communication architecture of a DSM multiprocessor offers advantages in cost and design time, the impact on application performance is unclear. We study this performance impact through detailed simulation, analytical modeling, and experiments on a flexible DSM prototype, using a range of parallel applications. We adapt the logP model to characterize the communication architectures of DSM machines. The <b>l</b> (<b>network</b> latency) and o (controller occupancy) parameters are the keys to performance in these machines, with the g (node-to-network bandwidth) parameter becoming important only for the fastest controllers. We show that, of all the logP parameters, controller occupancy has {{the greatest impact on}} application performance. Of the two contributions of occupancy to performance degradation—the latency it adds and the contention it induces—it is the contention component that governs performance regardless of network latency, showing a quadratic dependence on o. As expected, techniques to reduce the impact of latency make controller occupancy a greater bottleneck. Surprisingly, the performance impact of occupancy is substantial, even for highly-tuned applications and {{even in the absence of}} latency hiding techniques. Scaling the problem size is often used as a technique to overcome limitations in communication latency and bandwidth. Through experiments on a DSM prototype, we show that there are important classes of applications for which the performance lost by using higher occupancy controllers cannot be regained easily, if at all, by scaling the problem size.

40|$|Representing large {{biological}} data as networks {{is becoming}} increasingly adopted for predicting gene function while elucidating the multifaceted organization of life processes. In grapevine (Vitis vinifera <b>L.),</b> <b>network</b> analyses have been mostly adopted {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that control berry composition. Whereas, some studies have used gene co-expression networks to find common pathways and putative targets for transcription factors related to development and metabolism, others have defined networks of primary and secondary metabolites for characterizing the main metabolic differences between cultivars throughout fruit ripening. Lately, proteomic-related networks and those integrating genome-wide analyses of promoter regulatory elements have also been generated. The integration of all these data in multilayered networks allows building complex maps of molecular regulation and interaction. This perspective article describes the currently available network data and related resources for grapevine. With the aim of illustrating data integration approaches into network construction and analysis in grapevine, we searched for berry-specific regulators of the phenylpropanoid pathway. We generated a composite network consisting of overlaying maps of co-expression between structural and transcription factor genes, integrated with the presence of promoter cis-binding elements, microRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA). This approach revealed new uncharacterized transcription factors together with several microRNAs potentially regulating different steps of the phenylpropanoid pathway, and one particular lncRNA compromising the expression of nine stilbene synthase (STS) genes located in chromosome 10. Application of network-based approaches into multi-omics data will continue providing supplementary resources to address important questions regarding grapevine fruit quality and composition.
