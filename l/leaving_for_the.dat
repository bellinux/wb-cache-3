5|$|That year, Hindman's father {{purchased}} a new plantation in Ripley, Mississippi. Meanwhile, the younger Hindman attended local schools before <b>leaving</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Lawrenceville Classical Institute in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, the third oldest {{boarding school in}} the country. Hindman received a classical education there and graduated with honors on September 25, 1843, as the class salutatorian. After spending some time visiting relatives and studying in New York, Hindman went back to Ripley and commenced his law studies under Orlando Davis, a notable local attorney and Whig Party politician.|$|E
5|$|As the Flames sank in the standings, their {{attendance}} also sagged. For most {{of their}} first 16 years in Calgary, Flames tickets were among the toughest {{to get in the}} NHL. However, by 1999, attendance had fallen off so severely that the owners issued an ultimatum: buy more season tickets or the team would join its departed counterparts in Winnipeg and Quebec City in <b>leaving</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United States. The fans responded by buying enough season tickets to keep the Flames in Calgary for the 1999–2000 season. The Flames issued another appeal for more season tickets in the summer of 2000. The campaign, aimed at increasing season ticket sales from a franchise low of 8,700 to 14,000, proved successful. The increased sales did not halt the Flames' financial losses, however, as the team estimated it lost $14.5million between 2001 and 2003.|$|E

5|$|By the 1860s, natural ice was {{increasingly}} {{being used to}} move western American products to the east, starting with chilled meat from Chicago. There was some initial opposition, both from the cattle-car owners and from eastern butchers, who stood to lose out from the trade; by the 1870s, however, multiple shipments were <b>leaving</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> east each day. Chilled butter from the mid-West was then shipped onwards from New York to Europe, and by the 1870s 15 percent of the United Kingdom's butter consumption was being met in this way. A chain of icing stations at Chicago, Omaha, Utah and Sierra Nevada allowed railroad refrigerator cars to cross the continent. The ability of ice companies to ship their product by rail from the east proved the final straw for the Alaskan ice trade, which collapsed during the 1870s and 1880s {{in the face of}} the competition, destroying the local saw-mill industry in the process.|$|E
5|$|During the Hundred Years' War, {{the army}} of King Edward III besieged Calais, and Edward ordered that the town's {{population}} be killed en masse.

When they came, he ordered that they be executed, but pardoned them when his queen, Philippa of Hainault, begged him to spare their lives.

5|$|During the summer, Baker was {{transferred}} to the 13th Aero Squadron after its commander, Captain Charles Biddle, requested that he join the squadron as a flight commander. Though reluctant to leave the 103rd, Baker felt that Biddle would not have requested him without confidence in his abilities. On July 20, the 13th Squadron recorded its first confirmed kill during a flight led by Baker; he and two other men shot down a German plane. In August, Baker and another pilot were promoted and given command of their own squadron; Baker was given charge of the 141st Aero Squadron, composed of 26 pilots and 180 enlisted men stationed behind the front line, where they had to wait for equipment to arrive before <b>leaving</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> front.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, {{the physics}} {{department}} at Cornell {{was looking for}} a new theoretical physicist, and Lloyd Smith strongly recommended Bethe. This was supported by Bragg, who was visiting Cornell at the time. In August 1934, Cornell offered Bethe a position as an acting assistant professor. Bethe had already accepted a fellowship for a year to work with Nevill Mott at the University of Bristol for a semester, but Cornell agreed to let him start in the spring of 1935. Before <b>leaving</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United States, he visited the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen in September 1934, where he proposed to Hilde Levi, who accepted. However, the match was opposed by Bethe's mother, who did not want him marrying a Jewish girl, despite being Jewish herself, and Bethe broke off their engagement a few days before their wedding date in December. Niels Bohr and James Franck were so shocked by Bethe's behavior that he was not invited to the Institute again until after World War II.|$|E
5|$|In Brownville, {{the route}} intersects with the {{northern}} terminus of Bridge Street (unsigned NY971H), a short north–south connector leading to NY12F on the south bank of the Black River. At this point, the CR190 co-designation ends and maintenance of the route becomes {{the responsibility of the}} state. Through Brownville, NY12E remains a two-lane residential and commercial street, intersecting with the southern terminus of CR54 (Brown Boulevard) near the Brownville Hotel, a National Register of Historic Places-listed (NRHP) property. At {{the western edge of the}} village, NY12E passes Brownville Cemetery before <b>leaving</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> surrounding town of Brownville and losing the Main Street name. The highway parallels a former railroad right-of-way as it heads through the town of Brownville, becoming a two-lane rural highway and gradually bending northeastward away from the riverbank.|$|E

5|$|Participation in the Crusades {{was also}} {{seen as a}} form of pilgrimage, and indeed the same Latin word, peregrinatio, was {{sometimes}} applied to both activities. While English participation in the First Crusade between 1095 and 1099 was limited, England played a prominent part in the Second, Third and Fifth Crusades over the next two centuries, with many crusaders <b>leaving</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Levant during the intervening years. The idea of undertaking a pilgrimage to Jerusalem was not new in England, however, as the idea of religiously justified warfare went back to Anglo-Saxon times. Many of those who took up the Cross to go on a Crusade never actually left, often because the individual lacked sufficient funds to undertake the journey. Raising funds to travel typically involved crusaders selling or mortgaging their lands and possessions, which affected their families and, at times, considerably affected the economy as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik ("Eastern Policy") {{at the end}} of the 1960s reduced tensions between the two German states. It led to a series of treaties and agreements in the early 1970s, most significantly a treaty in which East and West Germany recognised each other's sovereignty and supported each other's applications for UN membership, although East Germans <b>leaving</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> West retained the right to claim a West German passport. Reunification remained a theoretical objective for West Germany, but in practice that objective was put aside by the West and abandoned entirely by the East. New crossing points were established and East German crossing regulations were slightly relaxed, although the fortifications were as rigorously maintained as ever.|$|E
5|$|Wilt Chamberlain {{received}} {{criticism for}} {{his inability to}} win lead Kansas to a win in the National Championship game; Chamberlain later admitted that this loss was the most painful in his life. He returned to Kansas for his junior year and to play another season under coach Dick Harp. Chamberlain quickly became frustrated with the opposing teams' way of playing him, which primarily consisted of double or triple teaming Chamberlain in order to limit his offensive production and effectiveness. In addition, many teams resorted to running out {{the time on the}} clock when in the lead against the Jayhawks to increase their odds of winning the game. After the Jayhawks failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament that year, Chamberlain decided to forgo his senior season to play with the Harlem Globetrotters. He did not return to Kansas' campus for over 40 years after <b>leaving</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Globetrotters; he finally returned in 1998, the year before his death, when his jersey was retired.|$|E

5|$|In a {{checkout}} line, Veronica and Mac (Tina Majorino) {{discuss her}} relationship with Piz and what her FBI internship will mean for them. They then see someone getting arrested by the campus police for a fake debit card. Weevil injures himself, but finds himself unable to receive adequate benefits. Veronica gets Piz to accept her <b>leaving</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> internship. At the Sheriff’s station, Weevil is called out by several students as being the one who gave them the fake cards. Weevil is put in the jail cell, but he tells Veronica that he think they targeted him after he was showcased in the criminology class. She investigates several of {{the owners of the}} student IDs, who do seem genuine in accusing Weevil. Weevil gets bail, but Keith informs him that a student ID printing machine was found in the locker next to Weevil’s. Veronica and Wallace speak to a mechanical engineering professor, who says that it would be impossible for Weevil to be the culprit. Piz invites Keith to appear on his show in an election special before Keith informs Veronica that Weevil’s fingerprints were found all over the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Maria {{quickly learned}} of her husband's true character. She {{tried to ignore}} him by {{cultivating}} a greater appreciation for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after unwanted sexual encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is <b>leaving</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce {{are discussed in the}} novel and Maria seems to take his words as inspiration rather than the warning they are meant to be. After Venables attempts to pay one of his friends to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her for being an adulteress, Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been wronged by their husbands, but he always finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune her now deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum. At this point the completed manuscript breaks off.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the {{first-class}} season, Pathan scored 56 but took a total of only 1/91 for the Board President's XI against the touring Australians ahead of the Test series, and he was overlooked for Test selection as India used only two pacemen. He returned to play for Baroda in the Ranji Trophy. He played in four matches and performed strongly, taking 26 wickets at 16.03 and scored 166 runs at 33.20. He started the season with 6/85 and 1/34 in a draw against Uttar Pradesh, and then took 4/42 and 1/46 against Railways. He then put on an all-round display to guide his team to a victory over Maharashtra. Pathan took 5/64 and then scored 51 as Baroda made 305 in their first innings to take a 77-run lead. After taking 1/61 in the second innings, he scored an unbeaten 50 to guide Baroda to their target of 227 with four wickets in hand. In his final Ranji fixture for the season, he took 7/35 in the first innings to help dismiss Andhra Pradesh for 77, setting up an innings win. However, with India persisting with and tasting success with their Test bowling strategy, Pathan was also overlooked for the home Tests against England. Pathan's domestic season was interrupted by spasmodic limited overs duty. Following his recent uneconomical run in ODIs, he was not given a game in the seven-match series against England in November until India had taken an unassailable 4–0 series lead. He took 0/57 from ten overs in the fifth match, as India recorded another victory, but did not get another opportunity after the Mumbai terrorist attacks saw the two remaining fixtures cancelled. Pathan was then selected for the early-2009 five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka, but was not entrusted with a match until India took an unbeatable 3–0 lead. He took four wickets at 28.25 in two matches, but was again expensive, conceding 7.06 runs an over. However, he ended the tour on a high note when he combined with half-brother Yusuf in an unbroken eighth-wicket stand that saw India to a three-wicket win in the T20 international after a late flurry; Irfan ended on 33 not out. Pathan returned to India and took 3/50 and scored 51 not out in his only domestic one-dayer for Baroda during the season, which ended in a win, before <b>leaving</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> limited overs leg of a tour to New Zealand.|$|E
