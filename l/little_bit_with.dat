2500|$|Comic Jumper was {{revealed}} on September 4, 2009 at PAX. Joystiq interviewed Twisted Pixel's Mike Wilford who cited Final Fight as {{an inspiration for}} melee combat, while Contra and Gunstar Heroes served as inspirations for gun sequences, and said the humor as akin to Earthworm Jim. Wilford further stated [...] "Back in the day, {{there seemed to be}} a whole lot of mascot-type characters in games, like Mario, Sonic, all those things, and not many devs seem to be doing that anymore. We're trying to bring that back a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>with</b> our games." [...] Comic Jumper is the brainchild of Josh Bear, co-founder and director at Twisted Pixel. [...] Wilford stated that Bear had the idea for the game beginning in seventh grade. It was released for the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Arcade Marketplace on October 6, 2010 as part of Microsoft's Game Feast promotion.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's stripped-back closing track, [...] "You Were Good", Jim Adkins stated: [...] "A {{fair amount}} of the ideas for Damage started out as {{acoustic}} songs, like really rough acoustic songs. 'You Were Good' started out in a pretty acoustic-based world and {{when we tried to}} take it out of that world, we realized that without the acoustic guitar in there as a bed, it didn't feel the same without it being there. With 'You Were Good', we experimented around a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>with</b> fleshing it out and building the dynamics of it in a full band sense, {{but at the end of}} the day we all looked at each other and agreed it sounded better with just me and a guitar and the weirdo, Indian drone thing on there." [...] Guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton elaborated: [...] "It was just [...] with an acoustic guitar and his vocals, and there was never a point where he stopped and started over. He just played it from the beginning to the end live. Then I overdubbed an organ part and Alain [...] played the guitar part. That was really fun to do, and I don't think we had ever done it before, especially with vocals." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. On {{the way back to}} pit lane, Buemi declared to commentator Dario Franchitti his satisfaction with his success but admitted the victory was handed to him [...] "on a plate" [...] He later felt Rosenqvist was the deserving victor but was happy with the pace of his car: [...] "I think we were {{more or less the same}} pace [...] I’m very happy with that result, it just tastes a little bit different than normal." [...] Rosenqvist believed in the short-term he would look back at the whole race weekend positively for himself and Mahindra but was [...] "disappointed" [...] about his second-place result: [...] "Today, we were under pressure from Sébastien, we knew that we would be close as they looked very strong compared to yesterday. I knew that I had to drive a perfect race, every corner we had to drive perfect. I think we did a great job." [...] Third-place finisher di Grassi praised the track and the race weekend but acknowledged his team did not have the pace to stay with both Mahindra cars. However, he spoke of his enjoyment with his battle against Vergne and claimed his car was quicker in the second race: [...] "Yesterday we found some pace, which meant we could keep up a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>with</b> these guys, but we need to improve.

Botija's slap is a powerful one that after Chómpiras spins, he violently staggers that Botija has to hold him still to stop before he can give the warning. Even his slap was painful enough to Botija's latter hand. This was never the case with Peterete, as his slap only made Chompiras spin a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>with</b> ease.|$|E
