50|$|The {{great kiskadee}} (Pitangus sulphuratus) is a {{passerine}} bird. It {{is a large}} tyrant flycatcher; sometimes its genus Pitangus is considered monotypic, with the <b>lesser</b> <b>kiskadee</b> (P. lictor) separated in Philohydor.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>kiskadee,</b> 19 cm long, {{lives from}} Central America and {{throughout}} the northern parts of South America, like Belize, Panama through Bolivia, always along waterways. Its call is a nondescript whistle.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>kiskadee</b> (Pitangus lictor) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Tyrannidae.It is found in Argentina, Bermuda, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad, Guatemala, and Venezuela. Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical moist shrubland and swamps. It is sometimes considered {{to be in the}} monotypic genus Philohydor.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{specific}} epithet similis (Latin for [...] "the similar one") indicates, this species looks much like its closest living relative the rusty-margined flycatcher (Myiozetetes cayanensis), and {{also like the}} white-bearded flycatcher (Phelpsia inornatus), white-ringed flycatcher (Conopias albovittatus) and <b>lesser</b> <b>kiskadee</b> (Pitangus/Philohydor lictor). In fact, except at close range, these are all but indistinguishable from appearance alone. They and the two larger similar species mentioned above share much of their range. Though they all are apparently fairly close relatives, the group to which they seem to belong also includes species with rather different head-pattern, like the grey-capped flycatcher which also belongs to Myiozetetes.|$|E
40|$|Argentine birds new sightings. Presence of Pitangus lictor {{outside its}} range: a <b>Lesser</b> <b>Kiskadee,</b> the {{distribution}} of witch reaches northern Bolivia and Central Brazil, according to existing data, was seen al Los Talas, Buenos Aires Providence, on May 6, 1979. Three weeks later, it was captured by Juan Klimaitis. It presence in Argentine is new and it is strange that, although an insectivorous birds, it was found in winter. Observation of a Commun Dowitcher of the genus Limnodromus : there are differing opinion {{about the presence of}} Limnodromus acolopaseus in Argentine. The only specimen taken so far in this country is a female of L. scolopaseus. Since it is most difficult to separate the two species much of the literature about the distribution in South America may be wrong. A Common Dowitcher was seen and photographed near Cape San Antonio, Buenos Aires Province, on December 6, 1977. Amongst other specialists consulted was Dr. Franf A. Pitelka; he believe that it was a male of L. scolopaseus in its first autumn plumage. This would represent the second record of this species in the country. Discovery of Aphryza virgata in Argentine territory: lt is not difficult to imagine that the Sud Bird which migrates from North America to the far south of Chile could also reach the Argntine sector of Tierra del Fuego. This distribution was confirmed by the observation of an individual on the beaches near Ushuaia on February 19, 1978. This is the first record for Argentine...|$|E
