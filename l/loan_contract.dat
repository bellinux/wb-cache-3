40|$|This study {{examines}} empirically how bank regulations adopted in lender countries influence {{the characteristics of}} <b>loan</b> <b>contracts,</b> using a sample of 46, 453 loans made by 278 large commercial banks around 39 countries, to borrowers in 83 countries, in the period from 1998 to 2006. Our findings indicate that the stringency of capital regulations have an inverse U-shaped relationship with priced risk characteristics (spread and maturity) of <b>loan</b> <b>contracts.</b> In addition, more powerful official supervision is associated with riskier <b>loan</b> <b>contracts.</b> Both official supervisory power and private monitoring work as substitutes to capital regulation to reduce the (priced) risk measures of <b>loan</b> <b>contracts</b> when capital stringency is low. For higher capital stringency, supervision and private monitoring complement capital regulation in reducing <b>loan</b> <b>contracts</b> risk measures. Finally, we found that a country’s degrees of legal enforcement and bank industry competition complement capital and private monitoring regulations to improve risk characteristics of <b>loan</b> <b>contracts.</b> The evidence {{highlights the importance of}} how bank lending practices are affected by bank regulations and their interactions with themselves and other institutional country factors.

The club had been {{satisfied with the}} performance of Tomasson in the past six months, so they decided within just a few days to pay Stuttgart the second half of a total transfer fee at 1.0 million euro in order to sign a new two-year contract with Tomasson. In the first match of the 2007–08 La Liga season, Tomasson scored in Villareal's 3–0 victory against Valencia. However Tomasson mostly played the club's UEFA cup games in 2007–08, where he managed to prove his value as an efficient striker, by scoring a total of five goals in eight games. The season ended as the best ever for Villarreal, as the club managed to achieve a runner up position in La Liga. But on a personal level, Tomasson of course had a disappointing season, {{due to the lack of}} playing time and few goals scored.|$|E
25|$|Enríquez {{pursued the}} rights to become the Royal Guinea Company sole {{representative}} in Puerto Rico. Established in 1701, this entity served as a major slave trader and became the only one sanctioned by the Spanish Crown {{to do business in}} their American colonies. On May 16, 1710, he officially completed this goal, signing a <b>loan</b> <b>contract</b> with the company's general director, Juan Bautista Chouirrio. With this accord, Enríquez became a major slaver in the territories of Puerto Rico, Trinidad, Margarita, Cumaná, Cumanagoto and Maracaibo, also permitting the adquisicion of slaves from adjacent islands such as Jamaica, St. Thomas and Curaçao depending on convenience. Under this agreement, he was able to import 40 African slaves per year, which he could sale under his own criteria. The contract lasted for three years and it also provided exemptions for clothes and maintenance. With the liberty to purchase these from any port in the Caribbean without right charges, it is likely that this was further exploited to import products at cheap prices, providing a large margin of profit. For every peça sold, Enríquez paid 100 pieces of eight, which were combined with an additional fee of 4,000 per year. Danío was involved in the transaction (which would also prove convenient for him as an official of the company) and along the other parts, an accord to secure that wins and losses were divided on three equal parts between them. Enríquez was jubilous with this development and proposed public celebration to commemorate it. He held the contract for a period of four years, leading 19 voyages under the premise of acquiring slaves and maintenance for them. Most of them were destined to St. Thomas. However, only ten of these incursions returned with new slaves for a total of 96, the others were used to import 109 barrels of flour. This cereal was supposedly bought to feed his slaves, but instead it was sold to the wealthier classes for profit. It is presumed that other odd products acquired under this premise, such as wine, beer, sugar, aguardiente, cocoa, paper and even copper, were sold in similar fashion. His enemies were quick to publicly denounce this practice, albeit with some exaggeration. Years later, these rights were supplanted despite the protests of Enríquez. In 1713, the Royal Guinea Company lost its status and was instead replaced with the Royal Asiento of Great Britain. Enríquez immediately pursued a position within this new entity and quickly coordinated moves with some friends, Santiago Gibbens in St. Thomas and Felipe Henríquez in Curaçao, to establish a new business model once he acquired these rights. To further secure the success of this venture, Enríquez offered gifts and even stakes to people that were already involved with the company. In June 1718, attorney in fact Tomás Othey granted him the title of factor and completed a <b>loan</b> <b>contract.</b> Enríquez was only able to employ this office until September, experiencing a series of complications based on international politics. During this timeframe, Othey himself imported slaves through the South Sea Company.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} real exchange rate dynamics and financial market imperfections. For this purpose, we first construct a New Open Economy Macroeconomics (NOEM) model that incorporates international staggered <b>loan</b> <b>contracts</b> as a simple form of the financial market imperfections. Recent empirical studies show that such staggered <b>loan</b> <b>contracts</b> are prevalent in the US, UK, and Japan and direct shocks to the bank lending interest rate (risk premium shocks) are major drivers of business cycle dynamics. Simulation results only with such a financial market friction and a risk premium shock can generate persistent, volatile, and realistic hump-shaped responses of real exchange rates, which have been thought very difficult to reproduce in standard NOEM models. This implies that these financial market developments can possibly be {{a major source of}} real exchange rate fluctuations.

In the same year 1935, Roberts's assessment of date was supported by the independent studies of A. Deissmann, who, while producing no actual evidence, suggested a date in the reigns of Hadrian (117-138) or even Trajan (98-117). In 1936 the dating was supported by Ulrich Wilcken on the basis of a comparison between the hand of P52 and those of papyri in the extensive Apollonius archive which are dated 113-120.|$|E
