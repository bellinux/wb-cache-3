5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended {{well above}} the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather <b>like</b> <b>water</b> spilling {{across the top of}} an ice cube tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, a total of five compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E
5|$|Compositional mapping and Io's {{high density}} suggest that Io {{contains}} {{little to no}} water, though small pockets of water ice or hydrated minerals have been tentatively identified, most notably on the northwest flank of the mountain Gish Bar Mons. Io has {{the least amount of}} water of any known body in the Solar System. This lack of water is likely due to Jupiter being hot enough early {{in the evolution of the}} Solar System to drive off volatile materials <b>like</b> <b>water</b> in the vicinity of Io, but not hot enough to do so farther out.|$|E

5|$|In {{explosive}} eruptions, {{the eruption}} of magma {{is driven by the}} rapid release of pressure, often involving the explosion of gas previously dissolved within the material. The most famous and destructive historical eruptions are mainly of this type. An eruptive phase can consist of a single eruption, or a sequence of several eruptions spread over several days, weeks or months. Explosive eruptions usually involve thick, highly viscous, silicic or felsic magma, high in volatiles <b>like</b> <b>water</b> vapor and carbon dioxide. Pyroclastic materials are the primary product, typically in the form of tuff. Eruptions the size of that at Lake Toba 74,000 years ago, at least , or the Yellowstone eruption 620,000 years ago, around , occur worldwide every 50,000 to 100,000years.|$|E
5|$|Production for {{the album}} was {{conducted}} in a generally informal manner and took place at Electric Lady Studios simultaneously with recording for Erykah Badu's Mama's Gun (2000) and Common's <b>Like</b> <b>Water</b> for Chocolate (2000). This led to impromptu collaborations and a distinctive sound that is featured on the three albums. Frequent visits to the studio were made by fellow neo soul and hip hop recording artists associated with the Soulquarians collective such as Erykah Badu, Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, James Poyser, and Mos Def. Voodoos sessions also had visitors not associated with the project, including record producer Rick Rubin, comedian Chris Rock, and rock musician Eric Clapton. D'Angelo previewed songs for them, which they found impressive.|$|E

In fact, Gila monsters seem to <b>like</b> <b>water</b> and can be observed immersing themselves in puddles of water after a summer rain.

5|$|Coimbatore is a Municipal {{corporation}} {{administered by}} the Coimbatore Municipal Corporation and is the administrative headquarters of Coimbatore district] Coimbatore was established as the capital of Coimbatore district in 1804 and in 1866 it was accorded municipality status. In 1981, Coimbatore was elevated as a municipal corporation. The city is divided into five administrative zones â€“ East, West, North, South and Central, each further subdivided into 20 wards. Each ward is represented by a councillor who is elected by direct election and the Mayor of Coimbatore is elected by Councillors. The executive wing of the corporation is headed by a Corporation Commissioner and maintains basic services <b>like</b> <b>water</b> supply, sewage and roads.

5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{discussed}} the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, {{or were they}} rounded and spherical? Jing Fang wrote in the 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical like balls or crossbow bullets. He also wrote that the Moon and planets produce no light of their own, are viewable to people on Earth only because they are illuminated by the Sun, and those parts not illuminated by the Sun would be dark on the other side. For this, Jing compared the Moon to a mirror illuminating light. In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is like fire and the Moon and planets are <b>like</b> <b>water,</b> since fire produces light and water reflects it. He also repeated Jing's comment that {{the side of the}} moon not illuminated by the Sun was left in darkness. However, Zhang noted that sunlight did not always reach the Moon since the Earth obstructs the rays during a lunar eclipse. He also noted that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon and Sun crossed paths to block sunlight from reaching earth.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of props in Peking opera, costumes take on added importance. Costumes function first to distinguish the rank of the character being played. Emperors and their families wear yellow robes, and high-ranking officials wear purple. The robe worn by these two classes is called a mang, or python robe. It is a costume suitable for the high rank of the character, featuring brilliant colors and rich embroidery, often {{in the design of}} a dragon. Persons of high rank or virtue wear red, lower-ranking officials wear blue, young characters wear white, the old wear white, brown, or olive, and all other men wear black. On formal occasions, lower officials may wear the kuan yi, a simple gown with patches of embroidery on both the front and back. All other characters, and officials on informal occasions, wear the chezi, a basic gown with varying levels of embroidery and no jade girdle to denote rank. All three types of gowns have water sleeves, long flowing sleeves that can be flicked and waved <b>like</b> <b>water,</b> attached to facilitate emotive gestures. Tertiary characters of no rank wear simple clothing without embroidery. Hats are intended to blend in {{with the rest of the}} costume and will usually have a matching level of embroidery. Shoes may be high or low soled, the former being worn by characters of high rank, and the latter by characters of low rank or acrobatic characters.|$|E

5|$|The pre-Socratic Greek {{philosophers}} and Indian philosophers developed {{some of the}} earliest philosophical concepts of the Universe. The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or arche. The first to do so was Thales, who proposed this material to be water. Thales' student, Anaximander, proposed that everything came from the limitless apeiron. Anaximenes proposed the primordial material to be air on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the arche to condense or dissociate into different forms. Anaxagoras proposed the principle of Nous (Mind), while Heraclitus proposed fire (and spoke of logos). Empedocles proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like Pythagoras, Plato believed that all things were composed of number, with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the Platonic solids. Democritus, and later philosophersâ€”most notably Leucippusâ€”proposed that the Universe is composed of indivisible atoms moving through void (vacuum), although Aristotle did not believe that to be feasible because air, <b>like</b> <b>water,</b> offers resistance to motion. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.|$|E
