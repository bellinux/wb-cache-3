25|$|When rodeo riders invaded Hollywood, {{they brought}} {{a battery of}} rodeo {{techniques}} that Canutt would expand and improve, including horse falls and wagon wrecks, along with the harnesses and cable rigs to make the stunts foolproof and safe. Among the new safety devices was the 'L' stirrup, which allowed a man to fall off a horse without getting hung in the stirrup. Canutt also developed cabling and equipment to cause spectacular wagon crashes, while releasing the team, {{all on the same}} spot every time. Safety methods such as these saved film-makers time and money and prevented accidents and injury to performers. One of Yakima's inventions was the 'Running W' stunt, bringing down a horse at the gallop by attaching a wire, anchored to the ground, to its fetlocks and launching the rider forwards spectacularly. This either killed the horse, or rendered it badly shaken and unusable {{for the rest of the}} day. The 'Running W' is now banned and has been replaced with the falling-horse technique. It is believed that the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was used was on the 1983 Iraqi film al-Mas' Ala Al-Kubra when British actor and friend of Yak Marc Sinden and stuntman Ken Buckle (who had been trained by Yak) performed the stunt three times during a cavalry charge sequence.|$|E

It was so easy to slip back into Grey's world and {{get caught up in}} all of the amazing moments that make this show so much fun to watch. And while I expected the night to start off on a somber note, by addressing Cristina and Burke's fallout, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the attendees paid tribute to Bailey, by giving their new interns the same exact first-day speech Bailey had given them." [...] Lulevtich praised Meredith's story arc, noting the surprising turn her character evolution has taken, as she praised Lexie's introduction. While expressing a negative perspective on the writers' decision to have Torres be the Chief Resident, instead of Bailey, Lulevitch described Torres' adjustment to her new position as one of the episode's focal points. Despite praising Yang's storyline in the personal background, the concept of her interaction with the patient she was assigned to was regarded as predictable and obvious, [...] "When the man's family came to see him, and Cristina told them it could be for the very <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>It</b> was that moment that really got Cristina thinking about how much she did in fact miss Burke, as we later learned in the episode."

Regarding the storylines developed in [...] "A Change Is Gonna Come", Burrows elaborated, [...] "The season opener was promising in that it had the interns in a new role and introduced a new side of George. As all of his friends progressed from interns to residents, George was forced to re-sit his internship. This created new drama and also opened up the hospital to {{a whole new set of}} interns rife with their own set of emotional baggage and drama.
