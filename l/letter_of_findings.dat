2500|$|Shortly {{after her}} retirement, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the union for the {{majority}} of AT's nonmanagement employees, filed charges of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging {{discrimination on the basis of}} sex and pregnancy in violation of Title VII.

In 2001, Hulteen and several other women sued AT, stating its decision to pay them smaller pensions because of their pregnancy disability leaves constituted an unlawful employment practice under the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act, an amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and allows those on maternity leave the same coverage as other medical leave.

The second part focuses on studying the effect of changing the phone script used by desk auditors to offer assistance with payment arrangements and simplifying a follow-up <b>letter.</b> The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> the first trial indicate that none of the treatments had a significant effect on any of the outcome measures considered.

The head football coaches of the seventy-four junior colleges that participate in football {{were asked to respond}} to questions concerning selected attitudes held about the voluntary inter-conference <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> intent. The attitudes selected for the questionnaire were determined by a review of the related literature,a pilot study,inquiry letters, rules governing the recruiter,the present voluntary inter-conference <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> intent format,and personal conferences with football coaches. Each junior collage football coach was mailed a packet of information including an explanatory <b>letter,</b> a copy <b>of</b> the present voluntary inter-conference <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> intent,the questionnaire,and a post-paid self-addressed return envelope. Sixty-seven of the seventy four coaches contacted responded by returning a completed questionnaire. Each response was tabulated and identified with one of four areas of concern. Examination of this data suggested that the respondents were generally dissatisfied with the present <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> intent and felt that a more comprehensive national <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> intent could be developed. On the basis <b>of</b> the <b>findings</b> and within the limitations of this study,the following general conclusions appeared just ified: (1) junior college football coaches in California have recruiting problems that are different from those reported by high school coaches;(2) there appears to be a need for a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> intent designed specifically for the four year college that will service only the junior college athlete;(3) this <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> intent should include a section that explains the athlete's financial aid;and(4) the letter should be enforced by a national organization such as the National Collegiate Athletic Association...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the unique reading {{processes}} in Arabic, given its unique orthographic nature of natural inherent variations of inter-letter spacing, the current study examined the extent and influence of connectedness disparity during single word recognition using the optimal viewing position (OVP) paradigm. The initial word viewing position was systematically manipulated by shifting words horizontally relative to an imposed initial viewing position. However, unlike previous research, partially connected/unconnected three-, four- and five-letter Arabic words were displayed in {{the left and right}} visual hemifields at all possible locations <b>of</b> <b>letter</b> fixation. It was found that OVP effects occurred during the processing of isolated Arabic words. No OVP was found in three-letter words; for four- and five-letter words, the OVP effect appeared as a U-shaped curve with a minimum towards the second and third letters. Thus, the OVP effects generalize across structurally different alphabetic scripts. Furthermore, a perceptual superiority was found for words with right-positioned unconnected sub-units as compared to left positioned unconnected sub-units because of the differential sensitivity of the hemispheres to the gestalt form <b>of</b> <b>letters.</b> Such <b>findings</b> support the established view that the LH specializes in word recognition for alphabetic languages...|$|R
