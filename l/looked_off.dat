[...] "The New England Emigrant Aid Company," [...] which had been chartered by the legislature of Massachusetts in April, was then called [...] "The Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Society." [...] But afterwards a new charter was obtained for [...] "The New England Emigrant Aid Company." [...] The men engaged in it, Eli Thayer, Amos A. Lawrence, and others, began their work at once, arousing public interest and making arrangements to facilitate emigration to Kansas. As early as June, 1854, they sent Dr. Charles Robinson, of Fitchburg, and Mr. Charles H. Branscomb, of Holyoke, to explore the territory and select a site for a colony ... Dr. Robinson [...] his party climbed the hill along this spur, and <b>looked</b> <b>off</b> over what was afterwards the site of Lawrence. They marked {{the beauty of the}} spot and the magnificence of the view. Whether they thought then of what might afterwards occur is not known; but when the time came to select a location for the first colony, Dr. Robinson remembered this view from the hilltop, and this doubtless had much to do in the final decision. When he was asked, therefore, to go and explore the country with a view to locating colonies, it was not altogether an unknown land to him.|$|E

60|$|The {{beauty and}} the {{salubrity}} of Antium made it a very attractive place of summer resort {{for the people of}} Rome; and in process of time, when the city attained to an advanced stage of opulence and luxury, the Roman noblemen built villas there, choosing situations, in some instances, upon the natural terraces and esplanades of the promontory, which <b>looked</b> <b>off</b> over the sea, and in others cool and secluded retreats in the valleys, on the land. It was in one of these villas that Nero was born.|$|E
60|$|The {{height of}} the spire was about one hundred and twenty feet, and the five men engaged thereon seemed entirely removed from the sphere and {{experiences}} of ordinary human beings. They appeared little larger than pigeons, and made their tiny movements with a soft, spirit-like silentness. One idea above all others was conveyed to {{the mind of a}} person on the ground by their aspect, namely, concentration of purpose: that they were indifferent to--even unconscious of--the distracted world beneath them, and all that moved upon it. They never <b>looked</b> <b>off</b> the scaffolding.|$|E

60|$|Paddy looked {{this way}} and looked that way. He looked up in the treetops, and he <b>looked</b> <b>off</b> up the hill, {{but most of all}} he looked at the ground. Yes, Sir, Paddy just studied the ground. You see, he hadn't {{forgotten}} the fuss Sammy Jay had been making there, and he was {{trying to find out what}} it was all about. At first he didn't see anything unusual, but by and by he happened to notice a little wet place, and right in the middle of it was something that made Paddy's eyes open wide. It was a footprint! Someone had carelessly stepped in the mud.|$|E
60|$|It was on Copps' Hill, {{within the}} city bounds, one of the enemy's {{positions}} during the fight, that our wanderer found his best repose that day. Sitting down here on a mound in the graveyard, he <b>looked</b> <b>off</b> across Charles River towards the battle-ground, whose incipient monument, at that period, was hard to see, as a struggling sprig of corn in a chilly spring. Upon those heights, fifty years before, his now feeble hands had wielded {{both ends of the}} musket. There too he had received that slit upon the chest, which afterwards, in the affair with the Serapis, being traversed by a cutlass wound, made him now the bescarred bearer of a cross.|$|E
60|$|The church {{looked pretty}} outside, {{with the old}} weather-boarded wooden belfry rising above the tiled roof and western gable; and it was neatly kept but not pretty within, the walls all done over with pale buff wash, and the wood-work very clumsy. Sam and Susan behaved well and attentively; but Bessie fidgeted into her mamma's place, and would stand upon a hassock. Miss Fosbrook was much afraid it was to keep in sight of the {{beautiful}} bird. Hal yawned; and Johnnie not only fidgeted unbearably himself, but made his sister Annie do the same, till Miss Fosbrook scarcely {{felt as if she}} was at church, and made up her mind to tell Johnnie that she should leave him at home with the babies unless he changed his ways.

60|$|At last we neared some foothills {{which we}} crossed by a baby pass, {{and from the}} farther side <b>looked</b> <b>off</b> against the distant Tateyama range. Descending again, another stretch of plain brought us to Toyama, the old feudal capital of the province. It is still a bustling town, and does a brisk business, I was told, in patent medicine, which is hawked over Japan {{generally}} and cures everything. But the former splendor of the place has left it forever. The rooms in the inn, where neighboring daimyos were wont to rest on their journeys through, are still superb with carving, lacquer and paintings, but no daimyo will ever again hold his traveling court before their tokonoma. The man perchance may again tarry there, but the manner of it all has gone to join the past. Now he who wills may ensconce himself in the daimyo's corner, and fancy himself a feudal lord; nor will the breeding of those about him disillusion his midday dream.|$|E
60|$|Carley {{had her own}} {{reaction}} to this speech she could not help hearing; and inwardly, at least, her feeling must have been similar to Stanton's. She forgot the object of this climb and <b>looked</b> <b>off</b> to her right at the green level without really seeing it. A vague sadness weighed upon her soul. Was {{there to be a}} tangle of fates here, a conflict of wills, a crossing of loves? Flo's terse confession could not be taken lightly. Did she mean that she loved Glenn? Carley began to fear it. Only another reason why she must persuade Glenn to go back East! But the closer Carley came to what she divined must be an ordeal the more she dreaded it. This raw, crude West might have confronted her with a situation beyond her control. And as she dragged her weighted feet through the cinders, kicking, up little puffs of black dust, she felt what she admitted to be an unreasonable resentment toward these Westerners and their barren, isolated, and boundless world.|$|E

I dined with Lady Oxford, and then sat with Lord Treasurer while he went out. He gave me a letter from an unknown hand, {{relating}} to Dr. Brown,(3) Bishop of Cork, recommending him to a better bishopric, {{as a person who}} opposed Lord Wharton, and was made a bishop on that account, celebrating him for a great politician, etc.: in short, all directly contrary to his character, which I made bold to explain. What dogs there are in the world! I was to see the poor Duke and Duchess of Ormond this morning. The Duke was in his public room, with Mr. Southwell(4) and two more gentlemen. When Southwell and I were alone with him, he talked something of Lord Ashburnham, that he was afraid the Whigs would get him again. He bore up as well as he could, but something falling accidentally in discourse, the tears were just falling out of his eyes, and I <b>looked</b> <b>off</b> to give him an opportunity (which he took) of wiping them with his handkerchief. I never saw anything so moving, nor such a mixture of greatness of mind, and tenderness, and discretion. Nite MD.|$|E
