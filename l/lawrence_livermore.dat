5|$|By 1951, the {{laboratory}} {{had come up}} with the Teller-Ulam design, and thermonuclear tests were conducted during Operation Greenhouse. Tensions between Bradbury and Edward Teller over the degree of priority given to thermonuclear weapons development {{led to the creation of}} a second nuclear weapons laboratory, the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In February 2005, {{the leader}} of the JINR team—Yuri Oganessian—presented a {{colloquium}} at ORNL. Also in attendance were representatives of <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory, who had previously worked with JINR on the discovery of elements 113–116 and 118, and Joseph Hamilton of Vanderbilt University, a collaborator of Oganessian.|$|E
5|$|Noel Lee's {{first job}} {{out of college}} was as a laser fusion design {{engineer}} at a government-run nuclear research center called the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory. On nights and weekends he played drums for an Asian country rock cover band called Asian Wood and worked on his home audio equipment.|$|E
5|$|By 1991, {{development}} was behind schedule. Development slowed even more when <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory cancelled its {{order for the}} first machine, {{in favor of the}} C90. Several executives, including the CEO, left the company. The company then announced they would be looking for a customer that needed a smaller version of the machine, with four to eight processors.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Orlando Lawrence (August 8, 1901– August 27, 1958) was a {{pioneering}} American nuclear scientist and {{winner of the}} Nobel Prize in Physics in 1939 for his invention of the cyclotron. He {{is known for his}} work on uranium-isotope separation for the Manhattan Project, as well as for founding the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|From June 1951 to May 1953, Hayward {{was head}} of the Military Applications Division of the Atomic Energy Commission, where he {{conducted}} atomic weapons laboratory work at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He also worked on the foundation of the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory program in 1952 in close collaboration with Edward Teller. The culmination of this was working on the Ivy Mike nuclear test.|$|E
5|$|The launch customer, <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory, {{cancelled}} {{their order}} in 1991 {{and a number}} of company executives left shortly thereafter. The first machine was finally ready in 1993, but with no launch customer, it was instead loaned as a demonstration unit to the nearby National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder. The company went bankrupt in May 1995, and the machine was officially decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|A 22milligram {{batch of}} berkelium-249 was {{prepared}} in a 250-day irradiation and then purified for 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This target yielded the first 6 atoms of tennessine at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), Dubna, Russia, after bombarding it with calcium ions in the U400 cyclotron for 150 days. This synthesis was a {{culmination of the}} Russia—US collaboration between JINR and <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory on the synthesis of elements 113 to 118 which was initiated in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Joseph Brady of the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory studied {{irregularities}} in {{the motion of}} Halley's Comet. Brady claimed {{that they could have}} been caused by a Jupiter-sized planet beyond Neptune at 59 AU that is in a retrograde orbit around the Sun. However, both Marsden and PlanetX proponent P. Kenneth Seidelmann attacked the hypothesis, showing that Halley's Comet randomly and irregularly ejects jets of material, causing changes to its own orbital trajectory, and that such a massive object as Brady's PlanetX would have severely affected the orbits of known outer planets.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s Bradbury {{oversaw the}} {{development}} of thermonuclear weapons, although a falling out with Edward Teller over the priority given to their development {{led to the creation}} of a rival nuclear weapons laboratory, the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> Laboratory. In later years, he branched out, constructing the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility to develop the laboratory's role in nuclear science, and during the Space Race of the 1960s, the laboratory developed the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). The Bradbury Science Museum is named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|ORNL resumed {{californium}} {{production in}} spring 2008. Hamilton noted the restart {{during the summer}} and made a deal on subsequent extraction of berkelium. During a September 2008 symposium at Vanderbilt (in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.) celebrating his 50th year on the Physics faculty, he introduced Oganessian to James Roberto (then the deputy director for science and technology at ORNL). They established a collaboration among JINR, ORNL, and Vanderbilt; the team at the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory (LLNL) in Livermore, California, U.S., was soon invited to join.|$|E
5|$|The first {{decay of}} atoms of {{oganesson}} {{was observed in}} 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. Headed by Russian nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, the team included American scientists of the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory, California. On 9 October 2006, the researchers announced that they had indirectly detected {{a total of three}} (possibly four) nuclei of oganesson-294 (one or two in 2002 and two more in 2005) produced via collisions of californium-249 atoms and calcium-48 ions.|$|E
5|$|During World War II {{he worked}} on the Manhattan Project, {{developing}} the mathematical models behind the explosive lenses used in the implosion-type nuclear weapon. After the war, he served on the General Advisory Committee of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and later as one of its commissioners. He was a consultant to a number of organizations, including the United States Air Force, the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, and the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory. Along with theoretical physicist Edward Teller, mathematician Stanislaw Ulam, and others, he worked out key steps in the nuclear physics involved in thermonuclear reactions and the hydrogen bomb.|$|E
5|$|He was Director of the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory, {{which he}} helped to found with Ernest O. Lawrence, from 1958 to 1960, and after that he {{continued}} as an Associate Director. He chaired the committee that founded the Space Sciences Laboratory at Berkeley. He also served concurrently as a Professor of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley. He was a tireless advocate of a strong nuclear program and argued for continued testing and development—in fact, he {{stepped down from the}} directorship of Livermore so that he could better lobby against the proposed test ban. He testified against the test ban both before Congress as well as on television.|$|E
5|$|In 1959 the Defense Department ordered {{one more}} {{study on the}} basic Zeus system, this time by the PSAC. They put {{together}} a heavyweight group {{with some of the}} most famous and influential scientists forming its core, including Hans Bethe who had worked on the Manhattan Project and later on the hydrogen bomb, Wolfgang Panofsky, the director of the High-Energy Physics Lab at Stanford University, and Harold Brown, director of the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> weapons lab, among similar luminaries. The PSAC report was almost a repeat of the RBIG. They recommended that Zeus should not be built, at least without significant changes to allow it to better deal with the emerging problems.|$|E
5|$|Just 23 {{days after}} his death, the Regents of the University of California voted to rename two of the university's nuclear {{research}} sites after Lawrence: the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award was established in his memory in 1959. Chemical element number 103, discovered at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 1961, was named lawrencium after him. In 1968 the Lawrence Hall of Science public science education center was established in his honor. His papers are in the Bancroft Library at the University of California in Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|LIFE, {{short for}} Laser Inertial Fusion Energy, was a fusion energy effort run at <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory between 2008 and 2013. LIFE {{aimed to develop}} the {{technologies}} necessary to convert the laser-driven inertial confinement fusion concept being developed in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) into a practical commercial power plant, a concept known generally as inertial fusion energy (IFE). Two designs were considered, operated as either a pure fusion or hybrid fusion-fission system. LIFE used the same basic concepts as NIF, but aimed to lower costs using mass-produced fuel elements, simplified maintenance, and diode lasers with higher electrical efficiency.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later in 1974, {{researchers}} including Glenn T. Seaborg and Albert Ghiorso at the University of California, Berkeley, and E. Kenneth Hulet from the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory, also synthesized the element by bombarding a californium-249 target with oxygen-18 ions, using equipment similar to that which had been used for the synthesis of element 104 five years earlier, observing at least seventy alpha decays, seemingly from the isotope seaborgium-263m with a half-life of 0.9±0.2seconds. The alpha daughter rutherfordium-259 and granddaughter nobelium-255 had previously been synthesised and the properties observed here matched with those previously known, as did the intensity of their production. The cross-section of the reaction observed, 0.3nanobarns, also agreed well with theoretical predictions. These bolstered the assignment of the alpha decay events to seaborgium-263m.|$|E
5|$|Florida State University {{aspires to}} become a top twenty-five public {{research}} university with at least one-third of its PhD programs {{ranked in the top}} 15 nationally. The university owns more than 1,600 acres (6.4km²) and is the home of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory among other advanced research facilities. The university continues to develop in its capacity as a leader in Florida graduate research. Other milestones at the university include the first ETA10-G/8 supercomputer, capable of 10.8 GFLOPS in 1989, remarkable for the time in that it exceeded the existing speed record of the Cray-2/8, located at the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory by a substantial leap and the development of the anti-cancer drug Taxol.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, von Neumann {{became a}} {{consultant}} to the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG), whose function was to advise the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the United States Secretary of Defense on the development and use of new technologies. He also became an adviser to the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP), which was responsible for the military aspects on nuclear weapons. Over the following two years, he became {{a consultant to}} the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), a member of the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, {{a consultant to the}} newly established <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory, {{and a member of the}} Scientific Advisory Group of the United States Air Force.|$|E

Preliminary chemistry experiments have indicated this element {{may be the first}} superheavy element to show abnormal noble-gas-like properties, even though it is a member of group 14 on the periodic table. In October 2006, scientists from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory successfully created synthetically oganesson (Og), the seventh element in group18, by bombarding californium (Cf) with calcium (Ca).|$|E
5|$|<b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory (LLNL) {{has been}} a leader in laser-driven {{inertial}} confinement fusion (ICF) since the initial concept was developed by LLNL employee John Nuckols in the late 1950s. The basic idea was to use a driver to compress a small pellet known as the target that contains the fusion fuel, a mix of deuterium (D) and tritium (T). If the compression reaches high enough values, fusion reactions begin to take place, releasing alpha particles and neutrons. The alphas may impact atoms in the surrounding fuel, heating them {{to the point where they}} undergo fusion as well. If the rate of alpha heating is higher than heat losses to the environment, the result is a self-sustaining chain reaction known as ignition.|$|E
5|$|Teller {{emigrated to}} the United States in the 1930s, and was an early member of the Manhattan Project, charged with {{developing}} the first atomic bomb. During this time he made a serious push to develop the first fusion-based weapons as well, but these were deferred until after World War II. After his controversial testimony in the security clearance hearing of his former Los Alamos Laboratory superior J. Robert Oppenheimer, Teller was ostracized by much of the scientific community. He continued to find support from the U.S. government and military research establishment, particularly for his advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program. He was a co-founder of <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory (LLNL), and was both its director and associate director for many years.|$|E
5|$|The phase {{stability}} principle was tested {{with the old}} 37-inch cyclotron at Berkeley after McMillan returned to the Radiation Laboratory in September 1945. When it was found to work, the 184-inch cyclotron was similarly modified. He became a full professor in 1946. In 1954 he was appointed {{associate director of the}} Radiation Laboratory. He was promoted to deputy director in 1958. On the death of Lawrence that year, he became director, and he stayed in that position until his retirement in 1973. The laboratory was renamed the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in 1958. In 1970, it split into the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> Laboratory, and McMillan became director of the former.|$|E
5|$|Livermorium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Lv and atomic number 116. It {{is an extremely}} radioactive element that has only been created in the laboratory {{and has not been}} observed in nature. The element is named after the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory in the United States, which collaborated with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia to discover livermorium during experiments made between 2000 and 2006. The name of the laboratory refers to the city of Livermore, California where it is located, which in turn was named after the rancher and landowner Robert Livermore. The name was adopted by IUPAC on May 30, 2012. Four isotopes of livermorium are known, with mass numbers between 290 and 293 inclusive; the longest-lived among them is livermorium-293 with a half-life of about 60milliseconds. A fifth isotope with mass number 294 has been reported but not yet confirmed.|$|E

In the North Bay, Napa and Sonoma counties are known for their famous wineries, including Fantesca Estate & Winery, Domaine Chandon California, and D'Agostini Winery.|$|E
5|$|The mantle is {{equivalent}} to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in water, ammonia and methane. As is customary in planetary science, this mixture {{is referred to as}} icy even though it is a hot, dense fluid. This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water–ammonia ocean. The mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice. At a depth of 7,000km, the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones. Very-high-pressure experiments at the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> National Laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may be an ocean of liquid carbon with floating solid 'diamonds'.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of this, Hugh DeWitt, a {{physicist}} at the <b>Lawrence</b> <b>Livermore</b> nuclear weapons laboratory, forwarded a copy to Chuck Hansen. Hansen was a computer programmer from Mountain View, California, who collected information about nuclear weapons as a hobby. He had run a competition to design an H-bomb, the winner {{of which would be}} the first person to have their design classified by the DOE. It now began to occur to him that his hobby might not be legal. On August 27, He wrote a letter to Senator Charles H. Percy detailing how much information he had deduced from publicly available sources. This included his own design, one not as good as Morland's, which Hansen had not seen. Hansen further charged that government scientists—including Edward Teller, Ted Taylor, and George Rathjens—had leaked sensitive information about thermonuclear weapons, for which no action had been taken. In this, Hansen was mistaken: Taylor had indeed been reprimanded, and Teller was not the source of the information that Hansen attributed to him. Hansen made copies of his letter available to several newspapers.|$|E
