25|$|The genomes of HSV-1 and HSV-2 {{are complex}} and contain two unique regions called the long unique region (UL) and the short unique region (US). Of the 74 known ORFs, UL {{contains}} 56 viral genes, whereas US contains only 12. Transcription of HSV genes is catalyzed by RNA polymerase II of the infected host. Immediate early genes, which encode proteins that regulate the expression of early and late viral genes, {{are the first to}} be expressed following infection. Early gene expression follows, to allow the synthesis of enzymes involved in DNA replication and the production of certain envelope glycoproteins. Expression of <b>late</b> <b>genes</b> occurs last; this group of genes predominantly encode proteins that form the virion particle.|$|E

All viral ORFs are encoded on one DNA strand (see figure). This represents a dramatic difference between papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses, since the latter virus type expresses its early and <b>late</b> <b>genes</b> by bi-directional transcription of both DNA strands. This difference was {{a major factor in}} establishment of the consensus that papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses probably never shared a common ancestor, despite the striking similarities in the structures of their virions.|$|E

During lytic replication of herpesviruses, viral genes are expressed in an ordered cascade. However, the mechanism by which <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> expression is regulated has not been well characterized in gammaherpesviruses. In this study, we have investigated the cis element that mediates <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> expression during de novo lytic infection with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV- 68). A reporter system was established and {{used to assess the}} activity of viral <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> promoters upon infection with MHV- 68. It was found that the viral origin of lytic replication, orilyt, must be on the reporter plasmid to support activation of the <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> promoter. Furthermore, the DNA sequence required for the activation of <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> promoters was mapped to a core element containing a distinct TATT box and its neighboring sequences. The critical nucleotides of the TATT box region were determined by systematic mutagenesis in the reporter system, and the significance of these nucleotides was confirmed {{in the context of the}} viral genome. In addition, EBV and KSHV <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> core promoters could be activated by MHV- 68 lytic replication, indicating that the mechanisms controlling <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> expression are conserved among gammaherpesviruses. Therefore, our results on MHV- 68 establish a solid foundation for mechanistic studies of <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> regulation. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology...|$|R

The mutant virus lacking either ORF 30 or ORF 34 underwent normal DNA replication but failed to express viral <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> transcripts, leading to nonproductive infection. In a reporter assay system, ORF 30 and ORF 34 were required for MHV- 68 to activate the viral <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> promoters. Furthermore, studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the viral late promoters during lytic infection was significantly reduced {{in the absence of}} ORF 30 or ORF 34.

In this study, we have explored the role of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) IE 0 and its interaction with IE 1 in the activation of very <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> expression from the polyhedrin promoter using transient assays. IE 0 is co-expressed with IE 1 throughout infection up to late times post-infection (p. i.) but shows peak levels of expression at early times. Significant changes in the ratios of the relative levels of IE 0 to IE 1 were observed {{throughout the course of}} infection. To study IE 0 in the absence of IE 1, we constructed a plasmid pAc-IE 0 M→A that expressed only IE 0. This was due to a mutation of the internal AUG that prevented translation of IE 1 from the ie 0 mRNA. Both IE 0 and IE 0 M→A were able to replace IE 1 in transient assays, showing that IE 0 is functional for very <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> activation and should be considered the 20 th <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> expression factor (lef). In transient assays, IE 0 showed that maximum very <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> expression is achieved at very low relative levels of protein. In contrast, IE 1 requires higher levels of protein to obtain maximum very <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> expression. Furthermore, when the levels of IE 0 become too high, very <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> expression rapidly declines.

40|$|<b>Late</b> <b>gene</b> {{expression}} follows and {{is dependent}} upon lytic replication of the viral genome. Although experimental evidence is lacking, lytic viral DNA replication is believed to remove modifications or binding factors from the genome which serve to repress <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> expression during latency or the early lytic cycle. We have developed a reporter assay to begin characterizing the mechanisms that regulate <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> expression in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In this model system, the activities of late promoter-reporter fusions are measured following transient transfection into tissue culture cells expressing EBV during different stages of the lytic cycle. This system faithfully recapitulates late expression patterns from the endogenous virus, implicating specific cis-active sequences in the control of <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> expression. In addition, these promoters respond only indirectly to the viral immediate-early transactivator, ZEBRA. This indirect response is mediated by other viral or virally induced activities downstream of ZEBRA in the lytic cascade. In this system, <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> expression is sensitive to inhibitors of the viral DNA polymerase such as phosphonoacetic acid, although the reporters lack a eukaryotic origin of replication and are not replicated under the assay conditions. Thus, replication of the transcriptional template is not a prerequisite for expression with late kinetics, a finding inconsistent with the current models which posit a cis-active relationship between lytic EBV DNA replication and <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> expression. Rather, analysis of this system has revealed a trans relationship between <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> expression and viral DNA replication and highlights the indirect and complex link between these two events...|$|R

The temporal transcription profiles of lef 2 revealed a 1. 2 -kb transcript in both delayed early and late periods after virus infection.
