40|$|Learning {{analytics}} {{seeks to}} enhance the learning process through systematic measurements of learning related data and to provide informative feedback to learners and teachers, so as to support the regulation of the learning. Track data from technology enhanced learning systems constitute the main data source for learning analytics. This empirical contribution provides an application of Buckingham Shum and Deakin Crick’s theoretical framework of dispositional learning analytics [1]: an infrastructure that combines learning dispositions data with data extracted from computer assisted, formative assessments. In a large introductory quantitative methods module based {{on the principles of}} blended learning, combining face-to-face problem-based learning sessions with e-tutorials, we investigate the predictive power of learning dispositions, outcomes of continuous formative assessments and other system generated data in modeling student performance and their potential to generate informative feedback. Using a dynamic, <b>longitudinal</b> perspective, <b>Computer</b> Assisted Formative Assessments seem to be the best predictor for detecting underperforming students and academic performance, while basic LMS data did not substantially predict learning...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This {{paper is}} about the {{application}} of second order sliding mode control to solving automatic space docking problem. Two problems are considered herein, first {{the establishment of a}} close formation by the steering of the last stage thrust engine, and its proper termination, and then the docking by itself using centre of gravity and attitude thrusters. The design is based on a combination of second order sliding mode control and minimal time (bang-bang) control techniques. Tri-level control is combined with bang-bang control at the last stage of docking to reduce the fuel consumption whereas second order sliding mode control provides required robustness to model uncertainties and considerable simplification of the model used in the design. A continuous (super-twisting) second order sliding mode control is used in controlling of normal and out-of-plane motion, and a pulse width modulation implementation there of is used {{in the design of the}} control of <b>longitudinal</b> motion. <b>Computer</b> simulations show that the design achieves excellent performances not withstanding considerable model uncertainties introduced and despite considerable simplification introduced in the model of relative motion used in the control design.

40|$|Long-span {{box girder}} bridges usually can be approximated, ~or the purp~se of global behavior, as {{thin-wall}} beams of closed cross sectIon,. underg~mg longitudinal warping and transverse distortion. The ordinary differ~ntIal equatl~ns of such beams {{in terms of}} the parameters of the assumed baSIC deformatIon modes of cross section were derived in the general form by V!asov (27) ~nd were extended by others (3, 10). Analytical solutions of some SImple p~actIcal cases have been obtained by Dabrowski (10), Wittrick, He~p, Argyns (~ 9), and Benscoter (6).

For <b>computer</b> matnx analysIs the most versatile and convenient formulation is the finite element stiffness method which was applied to the problem by Scordelis, et al. (17, 24) and others / 1, 14, 15, 25). Yet the number of unknowns in this approach is very large because the girder is subdivided in both the longitudinal and the transverse directions...|$|R
40|$|This {{resource}} guide {{examines the}} research available, including peer-reviewed and opinion papers, {{on the effects}} of screen time (computers and television) and the impact it has on children 2 years of age and under. The research available strongly encourages parents and childcare providers to prohibit screen time during these developmentally-formative years. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has recently endorsed the idea ofnot allowing children 2 years of age and under to watch television or use <b>computers.</b> <b>Longitudinal</b> research suggests that significant amounts of early screen time potentially leads to attention issues for children, which most typically manifests as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD). There are certain bodies of literature that suggest this may travel further down the continuum and eventually manifest as Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and Conduct Disorder (CD). This is a crucial issue in contemporary American society, especially in our age oftechnological accessibility and awareness. Parents and child-care providers {{need to be aware of}} the benefits, 111 risks, and consequences that screen time provides children and make informed choices of how to best serve maturing children's developmental needs.

Other results are also presented. These results imply that commencing engineering and technology students are well placed to adopt online delivery and support of teaching and learning. However, while it might now be {{reasonable to assume that}} all students have access to computers and the Internet, the experiences of on campus students in computer laboratories with broadband network access will be different from off campus students accessing the Internet via a dialup modem connection. A small proportion of commencing students were unaware of the computing facilities provided by the university; an orientation program covering computing facilities and services would benefit all commencing students. <br /...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAchieving peak {{performance}} at a specified {{time is the}} primary goal of athletes’ training programs. To optimize performance and reduce the risk of injury, a comprehensive list of training program parameters (e. g. intensity, volume, frequency, distribution, duration and type) requires careful management. This work focuses on clustering of time evolution curves of training measurements. Training data are recorded densely over time. However, duration of follow-up and duration of the seasons vary among subjects. Also, subject-specific variation can induce substantial error. Functional data analysis (FDA) and longitudinal data analysis (LDA) are the main approaches to analyze repeated measures data (in which multiple measurements are made on the same subject across time). Typically, FDA is applied when the data are dense, assumed to be observed in the continuum, and a function of time. LDA is usually applied when data are sparse, possibly with different number of measurements across individuals, and subject to error. We compared several FDA and LDA methods implemented through publicly available R code: k-means based on the standard Euclidian distance, a discrete Fréchet distance [2], and a functional distance [1]; Gaussian mixture model–based clustering for standard [4], longitudinal [5] and functional [3] data; and latent class mixed models [6]. We discuss advantages and limitations including computational and practical aspects. References[1] Febrero-Bande, M. and Oviedo de la Fuente, M. (2012).
