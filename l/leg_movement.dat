40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{neonates}} with {{spina bifida}} aperta (SBA), <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> by myotomes caudal to the meningomyelocele (MMC) are transiently observed. It {{is unclear whether}} these <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> relate to functional neural conduction through the MMC. For optimal therapeutical intervention, pathophysiological insight in these transient <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> seems relevant. If <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> by myotomes caudal to the MMC concur with the execution of general movements (GMs), functional neural conduction through the MMC is implicated. OBJECTIVE: In neonates with SBA, we aimed {{to determine whether the}} transiently present <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> caudal to the MMC indicate functional neural conduction through the MMC. METHODS: During the perinatal period, fetuses and neonates with SBA (n = 7 and n = 13, respectively) were longitudinally analysed for concurrency between <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> caudal to the MMC and GMs. To address the integrity of the reflex arc in spinal segments (at, or) caudal to the MMC, tendon leg reflexes were assessed during the first postnatal week. RESULTS: At postnatal day 1, <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> caudal to the MMC concurred with GMs in 12 of 13 infants. Isolated <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> were observed in only 3 of these 12 infants (isolated vs. concurrent; p < 0. 005). <b>Leg</b> <b>movements</b> concurring with GMs lasted longer than isolated <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> (median duration = 11 s vs. 2 s; p < 0. 05). Between days 1 and 7, tendon leg reflexes (at, or) caudal to the MMC had disappeared in all but 1 neonate. However, <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> caudal to the MMC remained concurrently present with GMs in all five neonates available for follow-up after day 7. Comparing these <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> between days 1 and 7 indicated a decreased duration (- 44 %, p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: In neonates with SBA, <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> caudal to the MMC concur with GMs, indicative of functional neural conduction through the MMC. The disappearance of these <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> is caused by lower motor neuron dysfunction at the reflex arc, whereas neural conduction through the MMC is still functional...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{neonates}} with {{spina bifida}} aperta (SBA), <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> innervated by spinal segments located caudal to the meningomyelocele are transiently present. This study in neonates with SBA aimed {{to determine whether}} the presence of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> indicates functional integrity of neuronal innervation and whether these <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> disappear as a result of dysfunction of upper motor neurons (axons originating cranial to the meningomyelocele) and/or of lower motor neurons (located caudal to the meningomyelocele). METHODS: <b>Leg</b> <b>movements</b> were investigated in neonates with SBA at postnatal day 1 (n = 18) and day 7 (n = 10). Upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction was assessed by neurologic examination (n = 18; disinhibition or inhibition of reflexes, respectively) and by electromyography (n = 12; absence or presence of denervation potentials, respectively). RESULTS: Movements, related to spinal segments caudal to the meningomyelocele, were present in all neonates at postnatal day 1. At day 1, <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> were associated with signs of both upper (10 of 18) and lower (17 of 18) motor neuron dysfunction caudal to the meningomyelocele. In 7 of 10 neonates restudied after the first postnatal week, <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> had disappeared. The absence of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> coincided with loss of relevant reflexes, which had been present at day 1, indicating progression of lower motor neuron dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the presence of neonatal <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> does not indicate integrity of functional lower motor neuron innervation by spinal segments caudal to the meningomyelocele. Present observations could explain why fetal surgery {{at the level of the}} meningomyelocele does not prevent loss of <b>leg</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Longitudinal {{quantification}} of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> {{per minute}} for human subjects during both fetal and neonatal periods was accomplished from videotapings conducted antenatally (ultrasonography 30, 34, and 37 weeks gestational age) and postnatally (birth and 6 weeks of age).

500|$|After {{injuring}} {{his knee}} in a festival match {{at the beginning}} of the tour at East Molesey, Johnston attributed the injury to a lack of attention to detail. His new boots had spikes that were longer than usual, and the physiotherapist had failed to strap his ankle before the match. His knee soon failed. Johnston missed the first six first-class matches, and with it a month of cricket. He returned against the Minor Counties in late May and took 3/20 in an innings win. He staked his claim for selection in the final two tour matches before the Tests; he took 4/65 and 3/49 against Sussex and then led the way in a win over Hampshire, much as he did five years earlier, taking [...] 5/75 and 4/21. He had taken 20 wickets at 13.35 in his four tour matches and was duly selected to play in the First Test at Trent Bridge. He was economical but unpenetrative, conceding 36 runs in 36 overs without taking a wicket in a rain-affected draw. Between Tests, he removed Hutton in both innings of a match against Yorkshire, but it came at a cost; he ended with 4/186. He took match figures of 4/161 in the Second Test but England held on for a draw with three wickets in hand, as a recurrence of the knee injury while fielding intervened again. He then had an operation to remove cartilage in his right knee; this allowed him more <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> but also destabilised his knee. The same surgeon had operated on Compton's knee. After missing another month of cricket, Johnston returned with a remodelled action, and hauls of 4/51, 6/63 and 6/39 against Surrey, Glamorgan and Essex respectively, saw Johnston return for the Fifth Test at The Oval. Although the pitch was helpful for spin, a total of 74 overs in the match yielded 3/146, as Johnston was unable rekindle the form of 1948 following his knee injury. Compton and Edrich batted cautiously to ensure the victory that saw England reclaim the Ashes 1–0. He managed only seven Test wickets at 49.00, but his first-class form remained strong. After the Tests, Johnston took match figures of 11/73 and 9/124 in consecutive matches against Kent and the South of England; Australia won both by an innings. He ended with 75 wickets at 20.54 for the entire tour. His injuries were considered a major factor in Australia's loss of the series.|$|E

50|$|Individuals with {{restless legs}} {{syndrome}} have increased numbers of K-complexes and these are associated with (and often precede) <b>leg</b> <b>movements.</b> Dopamine enhancing drugs such as L-DOPA that reduce <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> do not reduce the K-complex suggesting that they are primary and the <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> secondary to them. Failure of such drugs to reduce K-complexes in spite of reducing the <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> has been suggested to be why patients after such treatment still continue to complain of non-restorative sleep. Clonazepam is another treatment for RLS; like other benzodiazepines, it inhibits REM sleep by enhancing levels of GABA. This inhibition of REM sleep significantly decreases K-complex count, and unlike L-DOPA treatment, clonazepam studies report improvement in sleep restoration. Therefore, drugs that inhibit REM sleep also decrease K-complex count.|$|R
40|$|AIM OF THE STUDY: In {{the present}} {{longitudinal}} study we investigated {{the relationship between}} prenatal motor behaviour and the postnatal neurological sequelae of infants with spina bifida aperta. METHODS AND PATIENTS: Prenatal isolated <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> and general movements of 13 fetuses/infants with spina bifida aperta were assessed by means of ultrasound recordings, and were compared with: 1. the spinal level of morphological defect (meningo-myelocele), 2. the postnatal motor behaviour, 3. the postnatal sensory function, and 4. the final motor outcome. RESULTS: In all 13 cases studied, the spinal defect was either at thoracic (n = 8) or at lumbal (n = 5) level. All fetuses displayed active <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> corresponding to the functioning of low lumbal myelum segments (L 4 - 5 in two cases or L 5 -S 1 in 11 cases), despite vertebral defects at high localisation. These <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> were of normal quality (normal in appearance) and endogenously generated, since no external stimulus was exerted to elicit them. This implies that in fetuses with spina bifida aperta active <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> can be generated at spinal segments which are located at (n = 1), or under (n = 12) the meningo-myelelocele. Postnatally, {{for a short period}} of time (mostly during the first few hours), <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> related to myelum function at (n = 1) or lower than (n = 7) the spinal defect were detected. However, only in two infants these early <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> were of normal quality and corresponded with the final motor outcome. In contrast to these early neonatal <b>leg</b> <b>movements,</b> early sensory function was strongly related to the spinal defect (r = 0. 76; P = 0. 005) and to the final motor outcome (sensory function predicted outcome in all infants of whom follow-up was performed). CONCLUSION: These data on fetuses/infants with spina bifida aperta strongly indicate that a discrepancy exists between the occurrence of prenatal <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> and the spinal localisation of the meningo-myelocele on the one hand, and between the occurrence of pre- and postnatal <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> on the other hand (quantity and quality) ...|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: Periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> {{in sleep}} (PLMS) are {{frequently}} accompanied by arousals and autonomic activation, but the pathophysiologic {{significance of these}} manifestations is unclear. DESIGN: Changes in heart rate variability (HRV), HRV spectra, and electroencephalogram (EEG) spectra associated with idiopathic PLMS were compared with changes associated with isolated <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> and respiratory-related <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> during sleep. Furthermore, correlations between electromyographic activity, HRV changes, and EEG changes were assessed. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PATIENTS: Whole-night polysomnographic studies of 24 subjects fulfilling the criteria of either periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> disorder (n = 8), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (n = 7), or normal polysomnography (n = 9) were used. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Spectral HRV changes started before all EEG changes and up to 6 seconds {{before the onset of}} all types of <b>leg</b> <b>movements.</b> An initial weak autonomic activation was followed by a sympathetic activation, an increase of EEG delta activity, and finally a progression to increased higher-frequency EEG rhythms. After movement onset, HRV indicated a vagal activation, and, the EEG, a decrease in spindle activity. Sympathetic activation, as measured by HRV spectra, was greater for PLMS than for all other movement types. In EEG, gamma synchronization began 1 to 2 seconds earlier for isolated <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> and respiratory-related <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> than for PLMS. Significant correlations were found between autonomic activations and electromyographic activity, as well as between autonomic activations and EEG delta activity, but not between higher-frequency EEG rhythms and EMG activity or HRV changes.

2500|$|The <b>leg</b> <b>movement,</b> colloquially {{known as}} the [...] "frog kick" [...] or [...] "whip kick", {{consists}} of two phases: bringing the feet into position for the thrust phase and the insweep phase. From the initial position with the legs stretched out backward, the feet are moved together towards the posterior, while the knees stay together. The knees should not sink too low, as this increases the drag. Then the feet point outward {{in preparation for the}} thrust phase. In the thrust phase, the legs are moved elliptically back to the initial position. During this movement, the knees are kept together. The legs move slower while bringing the legs into position for the thrust phase, and move very fast during the thrust phase. Again, the goal is to produce maximum thrust during the insweep phase, and minimise drag during the recovery phase. In the recovery phase the lower leg and the feet are {{in the wake of the}} upper leg, and the feet are pointed to the rear. In the thrust phase all three parts create their own wake, and the flat end of the feet acts like a hydrofoil aligned to give maximum forward thrust. The resulting drag coefficient (or more precisely the frontal area) is thus doubled in the thrust phase.|$|E

40|$|Modulatory {{descending}} neurons (DNs) {{that link}} {{the brain to}} body motor circuits, including dopaminergic DNs (DA-DNs), are thought {{to contribute to the}} flexible control of behavior. Dopamine elicits locomotor-like outputs and influences neuronal excitability in isolated body motor circuits over tens of seconds to minutes, but it remains unknown how and over what time scale DA-DN activity relates to movement in behaving animals. To address this question, we identified DA-DNs in the Drosophila brain and developed an electrophysiological preparation to record and manipulate the activity of these cells during behavior. We find that DA-DN spike rates are rapidly modulated during a subset of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> and scale with the total speed of ongoing <b>leg</b> <b>movements,</b> whether occurring spontaneously or in response to stimuli. However, activating DA-DNs does not elicit <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> in intact flies, nor do acute bidirectional manipulations of DA-DN activity affect the probability or speed of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> over a time scale of seconds to minutes. Our findings indicate that in the context of intact descending control, changes in DA-DN activity are not sufficient to influence ongoing <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> and open the door to studies investigating how these cells interact with other descending and local neuromodulatory inputs to influence body motor output...|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} the time structure of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> (LM) in {{obstructive sleep apnea}} (OSA) syndrome, in order to advance understanding of their clinical significance. LOCATION: Sleep Research Centre, Oasi Institute (IRCCS), Troina, Italy. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PATIENTS: Eighty-four patients (16 females, 68 males, mean age 55. 1 y, range 29 - 74 y). METHODS: Respiratory-related <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> (RRLM) and those unrelated to respiratory events (NRLM) were examined within diagnostic polysomnograms alone and together for their distributions within the sleep period and for their periodicity. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Patients with OSA and RRLM exhibited more periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> in sleep (PLMS), particularly in NREM sleep. A gradual decrease in number of NRLM across the sleep period was observed in patients with RRLM. This pattern was less clear for RRLM. Frequency histograms of intermovement intervals of all LMs in patients with RRLM showed a prominent first peak at 4 sec, and a second peak at approximately 24 sec coincident with that of PLMS occurring {{in the absence of}} OSA. A third peak of lowest amplitude was the broadest with a maximum at approximately 42 sec. In patients lacking RRLM, NRLM were evident with a single peak at 2 - 4 sec. A stepwise linear regression analysis showed that, after controlling for a diagnosis of restless legs syndrome and apnea-hypopnea index, PLMS remained significantly associated with RRLM. CONCLUSION: The time structure of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> occurring in conjunction with respiratory events exhibit features of periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> in sleep occurring alone, only with a different and longer period. This brings into question the validity, both biologic and clinical, of scoring conventions with their a priori exclusion from consideration as periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> in sleep.

The magnetic field stimulation method permitted sustained stimulation of statocyst receptors by mimicking body rolling. The statocyst-driven local interneurons were classified into four morphological groups (Type-I–IV). All interneurons except Type-IV projected their dendritic branches to the parolfactory lobe of the deutocerebrum where statocyst afferents project directly. Type-I interneurons having somata in the ventral-paired lateral cluster responded invariably to statocyst stimulation regardless of the leg condition, whereas others having somata in the ventral-unpaired posterior cluster showed response enhancement or suppression, depending on the cell, during <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> on a substratum, but no response change during free <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> off the substratum.

In Rana esculenta, crawling occurs during feeding, while jumping {{is used as}} an escape strategy. We examined whether a similar velocity-dependent gait shift appears in swimming R. esculenta. Typically, swimming frogs propel themselves by kicking both hind limbs simultaneously. Observations of out-of-phase <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> in swimming frogs have been reported, but were usually assumed to be associated only with directional changes.

Mathematical estimates of positive mechanical work required to move the centre of mass revealed that out-of-phase swimming is energetically less expensive than the in-phase gait at a comparable speed, but may not be ef®cient at high speeds. Possible explanations for this phenomenon are higher inertial energy losses for in-phase swimming, but at high speeds jet propulsion and an interaction effect may gain importance...|$|R
