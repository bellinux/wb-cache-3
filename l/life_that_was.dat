5|$|After the Norman Conquest, in 1066, Æthelwig {{was one of}} the few Englishmen trusted by the new King William the Conqueror, and {{was given}} {{authority}} over parts of western England. As part of his duties, he was a royal judge and held important prisoners. During the Harrying of the North in 1069–1070, Æthelwig gave aid to refugees from the north of England. He also helped the king in the rebellion of 1075, preventing one of the rebels from joining the others. Æthelwig died on 16 February in either 1077 or 1078, and was memorialised in a work on his <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> later incorporated in the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, a 13th-century history of the abbey and its abbots.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Want was {{published}} with an essay by Carlos Bulosan {{as part of}} the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.|$|E

25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle.

Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> Army. I found that the dream of continued service gave me a goal that helped me survive my years as a POW.|$|E

25|$|As {{several years}} had passed since members had left, this led to {{difficulties}} as well. Walker was unable to return, as he had taken the role as the replacement touring drummer for The Smashing Pumpkins to replace drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Lenardo initially was unable to return, as he had gotten married and had children and was living a <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> contrary to Patrick's requirements for him in the studio. However, after working through it, Patrick became more accommodating to his lifestyle, and Lenardo returned in a desire to provide for his family. Cavanaugh had been touring with Prong, but was able to return, and the band recruited new drummer Steven Gillis to replace Walker.|$|E
25|$|Honda's {{automotive}} manufacturing ambitions can {{be traced}} back to 1963, with the Honda T360, a kei car truck built for the Japanese market. This was followed by the two-door roadster, the Honda S500 also introduced in 1963. In 1965, Honda built a two-door commercial delivery van, called the Honda L700. Honda's first four-door sedan was not the Accord, but the air-cooled, four-cylinder, gasoline-powered Honda 1300 in 1969. The Civic was a hatchback that gained wide popularity internationally, but it wasn't the first two-door hatchback built. That was the Honda N360, another Kei car that was adapted for international sale as the N600. The Civic, which appeared in 1972 and replaced the N600 also had a smaller sibling that replaced the air-cooled N360, called the Honda <b>Life</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> water-cooled.|$|E

25|$|Leydig studied {{philosophy}} in Munich from 1840, and {{medicine at the}} University of Würzburg from 1842 under Martin Münz (1785–1848), Schenk, and Franz von Rinecker (1811–1883). He received his doctorate in medicine at Würzburg on August 27, 1847, becoming an assistant in the physiology department, while also teaching histology and developmental anatomy under Albert von Kölliker (1817–1905). In 1848 he became prosector at the zootomic institution in Würzburg in 1848. The following year he qualified as a lecturer, and on May 9, 1855 he was appointed professor. In the winter of 1850–1851, Leydig made a journey to Sardinia, where {{he became aware of}} the rich marine <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> to become the subject of some of his most important researches. That journey, coupled with his early preoccupation with microscopy, directed the course of his life’s work.|$|E
25|$|The {{areas that}} were {{affected}} by the strongest shaking were the outlying communities north of Los Angeles that are bounded by {{the northern edge of}} the San Fernando Valley {{at the base of the}} San Gabriel Mountains. The unincorporated districts of Newhall, Saugus, and Solemint Junction had moderate damage, even to newer buildings. The area where the heaviest effects were present was limited by geographical features on the three remaining margins, with the Santa Susana Mountains on the west, the Santa Monica Mountains and the Los Angeles River to the south, and along the Verdugo Mountains to the east. Loss of <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> directly attributable to the earthquake amounted to 58 (a number of heart attack and other health-related deaths were not included in this figure). Most deaths occurred at the Veterans and Olive View hospital complexes, and the rest were located at private residences, the highway overpass collapses, and a ceiling collapse at the Midnight Mission in downtown Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s the {{atmosphere}} in Urdu literature became very depressing. The progressive movement was almost dead and the modernist movement had started running out of ideas. But this was also the time for an upsurge of new creative forces rooted in the new <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> metamorphosing the socio-economic and political climate in the sub-continent. It was under this climate that a new era of fiction started with the publication of Paigham Afaqui's novel Makaan. Afaqui and other writers refused to be identified by any movement and displayed complete independence in using personally developed styles and techniques for writing novels and explored their own philosophy and vision of life. It was a serious departure from the theme of independence which dominated writers like Qurratulain Hyder and Abdullah Hussain and the theme of existentialism which was the benchmark of modernism. Writers like Ghazanfer and Musharraf Alam Zauqi have further widened the horizons of new themes and concerns.|$|E

His diary is full of references to Yiddish writers. Yet he was at times alienated from Judaism and Jewish life: [...] "What have I in common with Jews?
