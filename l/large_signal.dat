Bipolars are generally better {{when it comes to}} input voltage offset, and often have lower noise.

25|$|A {{vertical}} input {{goes to a}} frequency-compensated step attenuator {{to reduce}} large signals to prevent overload. The attenuator feeds a low-level stage (or a few), which in turn feed gain stages (and a delay-line driver {{if there is a}} delay). Following are more gain stages, up to the final output stage which develops a <b>large</b> <b>signal</b> swing (tens of volts, sometimes over 100 volts) for CRT electrostatic deflection.|$|E
25|$|Because CT and MRI are {{sensitive}} to different tissue properties, {{the appearance of the}} images obtained with the two techniques differ markedly. In CT, X-rays must be blocked by some form of dense tissue to create an image, so the image quality when looking at soft tissues will be poor. In MRI, while any nucleus with a net nuclear spin can be used, the proton of the hydrogen atom remains the most widely used, especially in the clinical setting, because it is so ubiquitous and returns a <b>large</b> <b>signal.</b> This nucleus, present in water molecules, allows the excellent soft-tissue contrast achievable with MRI.|$|E
25|$|Kinetic isotope {{effects are}} common in {{biological}} systems and are especially important for hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry. Kinetic effects usually result in larger fractionations than equilibrium reactions. In any isotope system, kinetic effects are stronger for larger mass differences. Light isotopes in most systems also tend to move faster but form weaker bonds. At high temperatures, entropy explains a <b>large</b> <b>signal</b> in isotope composition. However, when temperature decreases isotope effects are more expressed and randomness plays less of a role. These general trends are exposed in further understanding of bond breaking, diffusion or effusion, and condensation or evaporation reactions.|$|E

25|$|Disks around {{brown dwarfs}} {{have been found}} to have many of the same {{features}} as disks around stars; therefore, it is expected that there will be accretion-formed planets around brown dwarfs. Given the small mass of brown dwarf disks, most planets will be terrestrial planets rather than gas giants. If a giant planet orbits a brown dwarf across our line of sight, then, because they have approximately the same diameter, this would give a <b>large</b> <b>signal</b> for detection by transit. The accretion zone for planets around a brown dwarf is very close to the brown dwarf itself, so tidal forces would have a strong effect.|$|E
25|$|In general, neither {{impedance}} nor admittance can be {{time varying}} {{as they are}} defined for complex exponentials for –∞ < t < +∞. If the complex exponential voltage–current ratio changes over time or amplitude, the circuit element cannot be described using the frequency domain. However, many systems (e.g., varicaps {{that are used in}} radio tuners) may exhibit non-linear or time-varying voltage–current ratios that appear to be linear time-invariant (LTI) for small signals over small observation windows; hence, they can be roughly described as having a time-varying impedance. That is, this description is an approximation; over <b>large</b> <b>signal</b> swings or observation windows, the voltage–current relationship is non-LTI and cannot be described by impedance.|$|E
25|$|Spatially encoded {{frequency}} domain OCT (SEFD-OCT, spectral domain or Fourier domain OCT) extracts spectral information by distributing different optical frequencies onto a detector stripe (line-array CCD or CMOS) via a dispersive element (see Fig. 4). Thereby the information {{of the full}} depth scan can be acquired within a single exposure. However, the <b>large</b> <b>signal</b> to noise advantage of FD-OCT is reduced due to the lower dynamic range of stripe detectors with respect to single photosensitive diodes, resulting in an SNR (signal to noise ratio) advantage of ~10 dB at much higher speeds. This is {{not much of a}} problem when working at 1300nm, however, since dynamic range is not a serious problem at this wavelength range.|$|E

In this thesis, we conducted step by step tests to verify the performance of the HXD-II, and examinations focused on primary cosmic rays. rstly, we tested each component of Well-counter units. Then, we proceeded to the examination for a whole Well-counter unit. In the end, we investigated the response of a Well-counter unit to large singnals by primary cosmic rays, utilizing accelerated iron ions and LED pulses. We conrmed that the electronics work correctly for <b>large</b> <b>signals</b> except for possible problems about the response to extraordinary <b>large</b> <b>signals,</b> and secondary particles from Anti-counter units.

2500|$|Collector {{triggering}} input circuit: {{the input}} trigger signal is fed to the collector via a fast switching diode , possibly after being {{shaped by a}} pulse shaping network. This way of driving an avalanche transistor was extensively employed in first generation circuits since the collector node has a high impedance and also collector capacitance [...] behaves quite linearly under <b>large</b> <b>signal</b> regime. As a consequence of this, the delay time from input to output is very small and approximately independent {{of the value of}} control voltage. However, this trigger circuit requires a diode capable of resist to high reverse voltages and switch very fast, characteristics that are very difficult to realize in the same diode, therefore it is rarely seen in modern avalanche transistor circuits.|$|E
2500|$|Base {{triggering}} input circuit: {{the input}} trigger signal is fed {{directly to the}} base via a fast switching diode , possibly after being shaped by a pulse shaping network. This way of driving an avalanche transistor was relatively less employed in first generation circuits because the base node has a relatively low impedance and an input capacitance [...] which is highly nonlinear (as a matter of fact, it is exponential) under the <b>large</b> <b>signal</b> regime: this causes a fairly large, input voltage dependent, delay time, which was analyzed in detail in the paper [...] However, the required inverse voltage for the feed diode is far lower respect diodes {{to be used in}} collectior trigger input circuits, and since ultra fast Schottky diodes are easily and cheaply found, this is the driver circuit employed in most modern avalanche transistor circuit. This is also the reason why the diode [...] in the following applicative circuits is symbolized as a Schottky diode.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1985, Capital Cities Communications {{announced}} it was purchasing ABC, a move that stunned the broadcast industry since ABC was some four times larger than Capital Cities at the time. Some have said that Capital Cities was only able {{to pull off the}} deal because WPVI-TV, the company's flagship property, had become very profitable in its own right. However, the merged company almost had to sell off Channel 6 due to a <b>large</b> <b>signal</b> overlap with WABC-TV. In the FCC's view, the merger gave the new company a de facto duopoly prohibited by the regulations of the time—the same [...] "one-to-a-market" [...] rule that forced Triangle to split its newspaper/broadcast combination in Philadelphia many years earlier. Capital Cities sought a waiver of the rules to keep WPVI, citing CBS' then-ownership of WCBS-TV in New York City and WCAU-TV locally in Philadelphia. The FCC granted the waiver, and when the transaction was finalized in early 1986, WPVI-TV became an ABC owned-and-operated station. A decade later, in 1996, The Walt Disney Company purchased Capital Cities/ABC.|$|E

2500|$|The {{differential}} dynamical mode described here, {{also called}} the small signal model, is the only intrinsic small signal model of the avalanche transistor. Stray elements due to the package enclosing the transistor are deliberately neglected, since their analysis would not add anything useful {{from the point of}} view of the working principles of the avalanche transistor. [...] However, when realizing an [...] electronic circuit, those parameters are of great importance. [...] Particularly, stray inductances in series with collector and emitter leads have to be minimized to preserve the high speed performance of avalanche transistor circuits. [...] Also, this equivalent circuit is useful when describing the behavior of the avalanche transistor near its turn on time, where collector currents and voltages are still near their quiescent values: in the real circuit it permits the calculation of time constants and therefore rise and fall times of the [...] waveform. However, since avalanche transistor switching circuits are intrinsically <b>large</b> <b>signal</b> circuits, the only way to predict with reasonable accuracy their real behaviour is to do numerical simulations.

2500|$|Avalanche {{transistor}} circuits are intrinsically <b>large</b> <b>signal</b> circuits, {{so small}} signal models, {{when applied to}} such circuits, can only give a qualitative description. To obtain more accurate information about the behavior of time dependent voltages and currents in such circuits {{it is necessary to}} use numerical analysis. The [...] "classical" [...] approach, detailed in the paper [...] which relies upon the book , consists in considering the circuits as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and solve it by a numerical method implemented by a general purpose numerical simulation software: results obtained in this way are fairly accurate and simple to obtain. However, this methods rely on the use of analytical transistor models best suited for the analysis of the breakdown region: those models are not necessarily suited to describe the device working in all possible regions. A more modern approach is to use the common analog circuit simulator SPICE together with an advanced transistor model supporting avalanche breakdown simulations, which the basic SPICE transistor model does not. Examples of such models are described in the paper [...] and in the paper : the latter is a description of the Mextram model, currently used by some semiconductor industries to characterize their bipolar junction transistors.|$|E
