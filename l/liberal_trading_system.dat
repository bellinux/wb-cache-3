40|$|For {{countries}} to engage {{successfully in the}} international trading system, their industries, firms, and workers must respond continually to new conditions of competition. The continuing need to adjust arises both from policy changes approved in multilateral negotiations – e. g., implementation of trade liberalization commitments, preference erosion, or adverse terms-of-trade consequences of export subsidy elimination – and from ongoing changes in competitive pressures inherent in a <b>liberal</b> <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> – e. g., effects on comparative advantage of changes in technology or factor supplies. But the political response to a situation calling for adjustment is often a call for “safeguards ” – whether as an ex ante provision in negotiated agreements or as an ex post measure once the agreement has been signed {{and the reality of}} new conditions takes shape.

40|$|The {{trade policy}} agenda in Pacific Island Countries (PICs) has {{certainly}} become crowded, as {{the cast of}} players involved in regional trade politics and negotiations has become larger. In fact it is commonplace {{around the world that}} players such as commercial firms, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and international bodies like the World Trade Organization (WTO) are becoming actively involved in trade negotiations at the regional level. Consequently apart from the state, other voices are exerting attention-grabbing influence in the conduct of regional trade politics. While firms have always played an important role, the rise of NGOs proclaiming that they are acting in the interests of society presents an additional challenge in the move towards a more <b>liberal</b> <b>trading</b> <b>system.</b> The demonstrations by NGOs at the WTO Ministerial Conferences in Singapore (1996), Geneva (1998) and the US (1999) are well known. It is also well known that such huge interest from NGOs led the then Director-General of WTO, Renato Ruggiero, to announce an enhanced plan for cooperation with NGOs (WTO, 1998). Penjueli and Morgan (2010) argue that a regional trade agreement of PICs such as the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) Plus would not {{meet the needs of the}} PICs and that such an agreement would displace ‘... domestic production and imports from other countries and [add] further to the considerable trade imbalances [of] many Pacific countries’ (p. 219). The authors of this article represent the Pacific Network on Globalisation (PANG), a Suva based NGO. The article is in fact a response to an earlier article by Kaufmann (2009) justifying the benefits to PICs of signing PACER Plus with Australia and New Zealand. The crux of the argument by Penjueli and Morgan (2010) rests on the basic idea that a preferential trade agreement (PTA) like PACER Plus would not meet the needs of the PICs. In this paper we argue that the lines of reasoning both Kaufmann (2009) and Penjueli and Morgan (2010) have used are flawed. The paper disagrees with Kaufmann (2009) that an agreement with Australia and New Zealand will bring maximum benefits to PICs and questions the basic issue raised by Penjueli and Morgan (2010) and PANG. From the publications of PANG it is unclear whether it supports unilateral trade liberalisation, although its opposition to a regional trade agreement among PICs and Australia and New Zealand is obvious. While we agree with the opposition to such a trade agreement, the reasons PANG argues cannot go unchallenged. Such reasons could prove to be seriously detrimental if carried over to challenge unilateral liberalisation, which seems most likely to be the case for opponents of free trade. Most of the arguments raised by PANG wrap themselves up in the language of job preservation, national sovereignty and infant industries. It seems that PANG and law professor Jane Kelsey, the key author of its various reports (2004 a and 2004 b) ignore the logic of the economic case for free trade and as a consequence, end up revealing the old and now discarded mercantilist rules...|$|E
40|$|Openness or Protectionism ? Three interrelated {{developments}} are currently at work which will affect profoundly the future {{evolution of the}} financial services industry: the marketisation of finance; the securitisation of financial intermediation; and the globalisation of markets. Against this background, the viability of individual institutions will depend on two basic elements: the capacity to keep abreast of innovations and market developments {{and the capacity to}} respond quickly and efficiently to the changing requirements of customers. It is with regard to this latter factor that the attitude of authorities towards the general issue of competitive equality, both domestically and internationally, will prove of crucial importance in determining the actual degree of competitiveness of the various groups of financial institutions in the global market. In this context, the paper considers briefly three major policy issues that have acquired growing prominence in international discussions in recent years: deregulation and reregulation; levelling the playing field; and the desirability of international rules of the game. The broad interpenetration of markets worldwide and consideration relating to the international competitiveness of national financial structures militate strongly in favour of further deregulation of financial markets. But the process of reregulation of institutions - mainly, but not exclusively, {{from the point of view}} of prudential supervision - is a necessary condition for preserving the safety and soundness of institutions operating in the more competitive financial environment. There is a broad consensus about the desirability of policies which would reduce the existing heterogeneity of institutional arrangements and regulatory standards across the world. But the prospects for a move towards greater compatibility of such arrangements and standards seem to be rather mixed. Indeed, the risk exists that the growing intermingling of instruments and intermediaries may exacerbate competitive inequalities and make more difficult the adoption of a global policy approach towards financial system management. The de facto integration of financial markets needs to be accompanied by the establishment of internationally acceptable ground rules for strengthening the foundations of a <b>liberal</b> <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> in financial services and for establishing a solid framework for international cooperation in this area. Broadly-based action in this field is indispensable in order to limit the risks of the re- emergence of protectionist attitudes, which would reduce the overall efficiency of the global financial system as well as lead to further distortions and incompatibilities between institutional arrangements and market realities. Ouverture ou protectionnisme ? Trois développements, actuellement en cours et qui sont liés entre eux, influenceront profondément l'évolution future du secteur des services financiers : l'adoption d'une démarche de marketing dans le secteur financier, la « titrisation » de l'intermédiation financière et l'intégration des marchés. Dans ce contexte, la viabilité des établissements dépendra de deux éléments fondamentaux : leur capacité à ne pas se laisser distancer dans les innovations et les développements sur le marché et leur capacité à réagir de manière rapide et efficace aux exigences des clients, qui se modifient sans cesse.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 131 - 136). The {{global economy}} is nowadays undergoing a profound change. Countries {{all over the}} world are privatizing their public sectors, reforming their economies and perhaps, most importantly, liberalizing their trade. In line with this trend toward freer markets and freer trade, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was the keystone of the post-world war II international <b>trading</b> <b>system,</b> was replaced by the World Trade Organization (WTO), which has an even more ambitious agenda for liberalizing trade and indeed integrating, virtually all the local economies into one essentially capitalistic global economy. Countries, {{all over the world}}, including Lebanon, are, nowadays, concerned with the issue of joining the WTO. Thus, the idea of undertaking a study on Lebanon's accession to the WTO came as a result of the importance and significance of this topic. In Lebanon, little is known about the WTO and its agreements. Many seminars and conferences have been held on the subject have helped heighten public awareness about the WTO and the advantages and disadvantages that may results from Lebanon's accession to this international organization. In this thesis, I examine the steps adopted by Lebanon to formally acceed to the WTO. The thesis also examines the implications of the WTO provisions on Lebanon, as well as the role of the Lebanese Government in preparing Lebanon to join the WTO and be part of the international <b>liberal</b> <b>trade</b> <b>system.</b> Whether Lebanon, will be able to join the WTO, at a future date, will heavily depend on the steps to be undertaken by the Lebanese authorities to prepare the country for the challenges that lie ahead given the trend towards greater economic integration. 1 bound copy: xiii, 136 leaves; ill, tables; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R

She restricts analysis to reciprocal RTAs involving developing countries in partnership either with industrial countries (North-South RTAs) or with other developing countries (South-South RTAs). Nearly every developing country belongs to one or more RTAs, so the author develops criteria for distinguishing effective from noneffective regional blocs. She then taps into many sources of data to compare levels of restrictiveness.

40|$|Countries facing {{voluntary}} export restraints (VERS) often adopt a two-tier allocation {{system for}} export licenses to the restricted market: (1) a "basic " allocation related to export shares to the restricted market; and (2) an "open " allocation based on export shares to the nonrestricted market.

The history of VER negotiations provides a rationale for such a policy and suggests that the recent increase in antidumping cases may be partly associated with the adoption of two-tier quota allocation systems.

It starts with a short comparison of different scenarios for the development of the world economy.

It then discusses how different research avenues give rise to different expectations with regard to cooperation versus rivalry. For instance, from a long waves perspective increasing rivalry can be expected. However, an analysis of strategic alliances points in the direction of more cooperation and collective management of international economic relations. And finally, analyses that give more attention to the internal restructuring of companies lead to the hypothesis that new societal demands for a more active state will be articulated, implying more frictions at the international level. An analysis in terms of "concepts of control" points in the same direction.

40|$|The {{integration}} {{of developing countries}} into world markets, and very particularly those in Latin America, is transforming international economic relations. Increasing economic openness should be a conducive environment not just for increasing trade opportunities for developing countries, but also for an invigoration of multilateralism. However, the new economic “openness” is posing a serious challenge to the existing international system of governance created under the GATT to regulate international trade relations. Developing countries have always felt that the rules and procedures of the GATT discriminated against them, while developed countries argued that they had excluded themselves from the benefits of multilateralism by adhering to import substitution.

This paper applies the gravity model to gauge whether this "outsider" status has been affecting Russia''s export structure.

The paper discusses possible explanations of this result, including Russia''s exclusion from various WTO procedures, although own-export restrictions could have a similar effect. The model points to Russia''s further trade reorientation toward WTO members after a putative accession.

40|$|This paper furnishes robust {{evidence}} that the GATT/WTO has had a powerful and positive impact on trade. The impact has, however, been uneven. GATT/WTO membership for industrial countries {{has been associated with}} a large increase in imports estimated at about 40 percent of world trade. The same has not been true for developing country members, although those that joined after the Uruguay Round have benefited from increased imports. Similarly, there have been asymmetric effects among sectors, with WTO membership associated with substantially greater imports in sectors where barriers are low. These results are consistent with the history and design of the institution, which presided over significant trade liberalization by the industrial countries except in sectors such as food and clothing; largely exempted developing countries from the obligations to liberalize under the principle of special and differential treatment; but attempted to redress the latter by imposing greater obligations on developing country members that joined after the Uruguay Round.

The prewar regime was destroyed at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference.
