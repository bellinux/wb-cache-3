This is done by using a light source that also produces infrared radiation, and having a fourth row of sensors on the <b>linear</b> <b>CCD</b> <b>sensor.</b> Photographic film is mostly transparent to infrared radiation (no matter what the visible image contains) but dust and scratches aren't, so they show up in the IR channel. This information can then be used to automatically remove the appearance of dust and scratches in the visible channels and replace them with something similar to their surroundings. A major limitation of this technique is that it can only be used on dye-based (color and chromogenic black-and-white) films; the image-forming silver particles in most black-and-white film stocks are opaque to infrared radiation.|$|E

The DRI has previously been demonstrated with a resolution of only 250 nm over a range of 300 µm. However, because DRI is an interferometric technique, phase information {{is inherent in the}} generated spectral interferograms and nanometre resolution could be achieved if that information can be extracted efficiently from a single interferogram. This talk describes a method of phase calculation using template matching which is a technique commonly used in image processing. Template matching is used to extract high resolution phase information from an experimental DRI apparatus. Spectral interferogram templates, representing axial measurement positions are generated using a simple simulation of the optical apparatus. These templates are cross-correlated against a spectral interferogram generated from the DRI apparatus. The peak of the resulting correlogram indicates the closest matching template interferogram and allows the inference of a measured position with high resolution. The template matching phase extraction method is evaluated in terms of linearity, resolution and operating range.

The disadvantage of this light source is its complex construction and high price. This study examines usage of simpler light sources. For example a point light source can be used. When using point light source, the size of the shadow, which the measured object projects on the CCD sensor, is not the same as {{the dimension of}} the measured object. This is caused by the divergence of the light beams. The size of the projected shadow must be therefore corrected. This correction depends on the shape of measured object.

40|$|The {{distribution}} function of relaxation times in disordered dielectrics has been calculated in the random field theory framework. For this purpose, we first consider {{the dynamics of}} single two-orientable impurity electric dipole in a random electric field E created {{by the rest of}} impurities in disordered ferroelectric. This dynamics is conveniently described by Langevin equation. Relaxation time τ is then a reciprocal probability (calculated on the base of Fokker-Planck equation) of the dipole transition through barrier in a double-well potential (corresponding to two possible dipole orientations), distorted by a random fields. The obtained dependence τ (E) made it possible to obtain the expression for relaxation times {{distribution function}} F(τ) (via random fields distribution function f(E). Latter function has been calculated self-consistently in the random field theory framework. Nonlinear random field contribution and effects of spatial correlations between impurities have also been taken into account. It was shown that nonlinear contribution of random field gives asymmetric shape of F(τ), while in linear case it is symmetric. Comparison of calculated F(τ) curves with those extracted from empirical Cole-Cole (CC), Davidson-Cole (DC), Kohlrausch-William-Watts (KWW) and Havriliak-Negami (HN) functions had shown, that they correspond to mixed ferro-glass phase with coexistence of short and long-range order.

40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is the most}} common cause of death globally. To detect CAD {{noninvasively}} at an early stage before clinical symptoms occur is still nowadays challenging. Analysis of the variation of heartbeat interval (RRI) opens a new avenue for evaluating the functional change of cardiovascular system which is accepted to occur at the subclinical stage of CAD. In addition, systolic time interval (STI) and diastolic time interval (DTI) also show potential. There may be coupling in these electromechanical time series due to their physiological connection. However, to the best of our knowledge no publication has systematically investigated how can the coupling be measured and how it changes in CAD patients. In this study, we enrolled 39 CAD patients and 36 healthy subjects and for each subject the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals were recorded simultaneously for 5 min. The RRI series, STI series, and DTI series were constructed, respectively. We used <b>linear</b> cross correlation (<b>CC),</b> coherence function (CF), as well as nonlinear mutual information (MI), cross conditional entropy (XCE), cross sample entropy (XSampEn), and cross fuzzy entropy (XFuzzyEn) to analyse the bivariate RRI-DTI coupling, RRI-STI coupling, and STI-DTI coupling, respectively. Our results suggest that the <b>linear</b> <b>CC</b> and CF generally have no significant difference between the two groups for all three types of bivariate coupling. The MI only shows weak change in RRI-DTI coupling. By comparison, the three entropy-based coupling measurements show significantly decreased coupling in CAD patients except XSampEn for RRI-DTI coupling (less significant) and XCE for STI-DTI and RRI-STI coupling (not significant). Additionally, the XFuzzyEn performs best as it was still significant if we further applied the Bonferroni correction in our statistical analysis. Our study indicates that the intrinsic electromechanical coupling is most probably nonlinear and can better be measured by nonlinear entropy-based measurements especially the XFuzzyEn. Besides, CAD patients are accompanied by a loss of electromechanical coupling.

In this work, an equation was obtained to estimate the pore-water electrical conductivity (σp), which {{is closely related to}} the soil salinity in contact with plant roots, from εb and σb data, by combining the simplified dielectric mixing (SDM) model that relates εb to the soil volumetric water content (θ), with the Rhoades equation that relates θ and σb to σp. This equation was calibrated with measurements of εb and σb obtained with the Delta-T WET (FDR) and the Decagon 5 TE (<b>CC)</b> <b>sensors,</b> in 20 pots filled with a clay loam soil and arranged as combinations of four levels of soil moisture with five levels of soil salinity.

For both sensors, the SDM model on the one hand, and the Rhoades equation on the other, provided the most accurate estimations using the least number of parameters regarding their respective alternatives, i. e. the third-order polynomial and the Hilhorst equation.

We propose a novel representation of the problem, as a cyclic bipartite factor graph, composed of variable and function nodes (representing the agents states and utilities respectively). We show that such representation allows us to use {{an extension of the}} max-sum algorithm to generate approximate solutions to this global optimisation problem through local decentralised message passing. We empirically evaluate this approach on a canonical coordination problem (graph colouring), and benchmark it against state of the art approximate and complete algorithms (DSA and DPOP). We show that our approach is robust to lossy communication, that it generates solutions closer to those of DPOP than DSA is able to, and that it does so with a communication cost (in terms of total messages size) that scales very well with the number of agents in the system (compared to the exponential increase of DPOP). Finally, we describe a hardware implementation of our algorithm operating on low-power Chipcon <b>CC</b> 2431 System-on-Chip <b>sensor</b> nodes.
