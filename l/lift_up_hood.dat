40|$|The “Pop-up Engine Hood ” helps {{makes it}} {{possible}} for automobile designers to help reduce head injury during pedestrian impact while maintaining streamlined hood design. Some countries have adopted pedestrian protection regulation and there is an on-going discussion in the United Nations WP 29 about Global Technical Regulations (gtr) and there is a possibility such regulations may be enhanced in the future. Many car manufacturers have been planning to improve pedestrian safety by various technical applications. In general, pedestrian head protection is achieved by creating space between the hood (which is deformable) and the engine component (which is not). However, this concept is difficult to apply to some vehicles, especially low engine hood vehicles, such as coupes and sport cars. The “Pop-up Engine Hood System ” which has recently been used in mass production vehicles in Japan may help with this issue. This paper will describe the system outline and key technologies incorporated in the system e. g. :- Effectiveness of injury reduction mechanism (evaluated using CAE analysis and tests) when a pedestrian contacts directly above or near the actuator, which <b>lifts</b> <b>up</b> the <b>hood.</b> - Technique to help reduce the dispersion of head injury due to hood vibration during the hood raising process. - Human kinematics during system operation evaluated by using Polar-II dummy (currently available as a pedestrian full scale dummy), and human body FE model...|$|R

That all that are ungodly, and do live and die in their sins, so soon as ever they die, they go into hell: he died and was buried; 'And in hell he <b>lifted</b> <b>up</b> his eyes.' Third. That some are so fast asleep, and secure in their sins, that they scarce know well where they are till they come into hell; and that I gather from these words, 'In hell he <b>lifted</b> <b>up</b> his eyes.' He was asleep before, but hell makes him <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> his eyes.|$|R

50|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} a priest whose hands were {{deformed}} should not <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> {{his hands to}} say the priestly blessing, and Rabbi Judah said that a priest whose hands were discolored should not <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> his hands, because it would cause the congregation {{to look at him}} during this blessing when they should not. A Baraita stated that deformities on the face, hands, or feet were disqualifying for saying the priestly blessing. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said that a Kohen with spotted hands should not say the blessing. A Baraita taught that one whose hands were curved inwards or bent sideways should not say the blessing. And Rav Huna said that a man whose eyes ran should not say the blessing. But the Gemara noted that such a Kohen in Rav Huna's neighborhood used to say the priestly blessing and apparently even Rav Huna did not object, because the townspeople had become accustomed to the Kohen. And the Gemara cited a Baraita that taught that a man whose eyes ran should not <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> his hands, but he was permitted to do so if the townspeople were accustomed to him. Rabbi Johanan said that a man blind in one eye should not <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> his hands. But the Gemara noted that there was one in Rabbi Johanan's neighborhood who used to <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> his hands, as the townspeople were accustomed to him. And the Gemara cited a Baraita that taught that a man blind in one eye should not <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> his hands, but if the townspeople were accustomed to him, he was permitted. Rabbi Judah said that a man whose hands were discolored should not <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> his hands, but the Gemara cited a Baraita that taught that if most of the men of the town follow the same hand-discoloring occupation, it was permitted.|$|R
