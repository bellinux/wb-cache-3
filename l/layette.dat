60|$|Then {{comes the}} tug of war. The young wife becomes a mother, and while she is retired to her chamber, blundering Biddy rusts the elegant knives, or takes off the ivory handles by soaking in hot water; the silver is washed in greasy soapsuds, and {{refreshed}} now {{and then with a}} thump, which cocks the nose of the teapot awry, or makes the handle assume an air of drunken defiance. The fragile china is chipped here and there around its edges with those minute gaps so vexatious to a woman's soul; the handles fly hither and thither in the wild confusion of Biddy's washing-day hurry, when cook wants her to help hang out the clothes. Meanwhile Bridget sweeps the parlor with a hard broom, and shakes out showers of ashes from the grate, forgetting to cover the damask lounges, and they directly look as rusty and time-worn as if they had come from an auction-store; and all together unite in making such havoc of the delicate ruffles and laces of the bridal outfit and baby <b>layette</b> that, when the poor young wife comes out of her chamber after her nurse has left her, and, weakened and embarrassed with the demands of the newcomer, begins to look once more into the affairs of her little world, she is ready to sink with vexation and discouragement. Poor little princess! Her clothes are made as princesses wear them, her baby's clothes like a young duke's, her house furnished like a lord's, and only Bridget and Biddy and Polly to do the work of cook, scullery-maid, butler, footman, laundress, nursery-maid, housemaid, and lady's maid. Such is the array that in the Old Country would be deemed necessary to take care of an establishment got up like hers. Everything in it is too fine,--not too fine to be pretty, not in bad taste in itself, but too fine for the situation, too fine for comfort or liberty.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>layette</b> is a {{collection}} of clothing and accessories for a newborn child. The term [...] "layette set" [...] is commonly used in the United States to refer to sets of baby clothes. In the 1920s, expectant mothers or their friends and relatives frequently knitted a matching <b>layette</b> set, consisting of a blanket, hat, sweater and booties. That tradition has continued to the present day.|$|E

Openings in each airway (the equivalent of finger-holes) are uncovered by moving <b>layettes</b> (sliders) fixed in four coulisses (runners). The two lowest notes use the same airway, so cannot be played together.|$|R

Dupuy also published, with his brother Jacques, and their friend Nicolas Rigault, the History of Aug. de Thou (1620, 1626). The two brothers then bought from Rigault the post of keeper of the king's library, and drew up a catalogue of the library (Nos. 9352-9354 and 10366-10367 of the Latin collection in the Bibliothèque Nationale).|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} musettes had up to nine coulisses {{and twelve}} <b>layettes,</b> {{so that you}} could play music in a range of modes and always have a drone using the home-note of the mode. As the chalumeaux developed and became fully chromatic, so it became possible to play music in different modes but starting on the same note; fewer possible drone-notes were needed, and the bourdon was simplified. Even so, the bourdon still contains four or more separate reeds that have to be kept adjusted and in tune.|$|R
50|$|The {{members of}} the {{original}} Society of 1887 consisted of Merrick's family members and friends, growing to become fully active in distributing <b>layettes</b> and garments and answering Christmas letter requests in 1890. In 1891, Merrick hosted 41 poor children in the D.C. countryside for two weeks; this {{was the beginning of}} the Society's Fresh Air program. A Council was formed in 1894 to consist of the supervisors of different Society committees, and a Board of Managers was established in 1902. Merrick believed firmly in lay service in the Church and she founded the Christ Child Society based on that belief.|$|R

5000|$|In 1961, Geiger's {{purchased}} Jack 'n Jill, {{described as}} [...] "Ohio's largest exclusive children's shop," [...] from its founder, Theodore F. Brooks. The Lakewood unit {{was the only}} surviving store of a chain of five that Brooks had developed over 25 years. Jack 'n Jill offered a complete line of infants' and children's wear, toys and gifts and a <b>layette</b> department for newborns, managed by a registered nurse.

[...] She became widely known in Rochester for her [...] "organizing aid for young mothers, widows, and children." [...] Mrs. Crapsey helped her husband in working with boys who belonged to the mischievous gangs in the Averill Avenue district in which they lived. This work [...] "resulted in disappearance of the gangs." ...|$|R
5000|$|In March 2009, Bachelet {{launched}} the [...] "I Choose my PC" [...] program, awarding free computers to poor seventh graders with excellent academic performance attending government-subsidized schools. During 2009 and 2010 Bachelet delivered <b>layettes</b> to all babies born in public hospitals, which are about 80% of total births. In January 2010, Bachelet promulgated a law allowing {{the distribution of}} emergency contraception pills {{in public and private}} health centers, including to persons under 14, without parental consent. The law also requires high schools to add a sexual education program to their curriculum. Bachelet, who {{has been described as a}} feminist, was in 2017 seeking to loosen Chile's anti-abortion laws.|$|R

5000|$|As a teenager, Merrick {{began to}} sew {{clothing}} for poor children from her reclining position, eventually organizing a small sewing circle {{to complete a}} <b>layette</b> {{in honor of the}} [...] "Christ Child" [...] to be given to a poor infant during the Christmas season. The following year, she encouraged a child of one her family's employees who told her he was unlikely to receive a Christmas gift to write letters to the Christ Child to request one. Thereafter, children began sending letters to the Christ Child requesting Christmas gifts, and she and her friends would fill the requests, noting them [...] "from the Christ Child." ...|$|E
5000|$|The nipple-pinching gesture {{is often}} {{interpreted}} as a symbolic announcement that Gabrielle is pregnant with Henry's child, César de Bourbon. According to the Louvre's website: [...] "The oddly affectionate {{way in which the}} sister is pinching Gabrielle d'Estrées' right breast has often been taken as symbolizing the latter's pregnancy with the illegitimate child of Henry IV. This interpretation would seem to be confirmed by the scene of the young woman sewing - perhaps preparing a <b>layette</b> for the coming child - in the background." [...] The ring that Gabrielle holds is said to be Henry's coronation ring, which he supposedly gave to her as a token of his love shortly before she died.|$|E

40|$|A {{program to}} promote {{breastfeeding}} was introduced at a migrant health center in North Carolina. Strategies for promoting breastfeeding as a feeding method particularly {{suited to the}} migrant lifestyle were identified and implemented. Donated <b>layettes</b> were used to encourage attendance of prenatal patients at a class on breastfeeding. Women planning to breastfeed were given cards to alert the delivering hospital of their intention. These hospitals were provided with bilingual flipcharts to use in communicating with non-English speaking patients. Of the 158 women {{who came to the}} center for one or more prenatal visits, 101 attended a class or received individual counseling on breastfeeding; during this 13 -month period, 52 per cent of 64 women who attended the class were breastfeeding at time of their hospital discharge (Mexican-Americans 60 %, Black Americans 44 %). In a comparison of similar ethnic distribution, the corresponding rate was 10 %...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let people {{individually}} {{look around}} {{their own little}} sphere, and ask themselves if they know any woman really excelling in any valuable calling or accomplishment who is suffering for want of work. All of us know seamstresses, dressmakers, nurses, and laundresses who have made themselves such a reputation, and are so beset and overcrowded with work, that the whole neighborhood is constantly on its knees to them with uplifted hands. The fine seamstress, who can cut and make trousseaus and <b>layettes</b> in elegant perfection, is always engaged six months in advance; the pet dressmaker of a neighborhood must be engaged in May for September, and in September for May; a laundress who sends your clothes home in nice order always has all the work that she can do. Good work in any department is the rarest possible thing in our American life; {{and it is a}} fact that the great majority of workers, both in the family and out, do only tolerably well,--not so badly that it actually cannot be borne, yet not so well as to be a source of real, thorough satisfaction. The exceptional worker in every neighborhood, who does things really well, can always set her own price, and is always having more offering than she can possibly do.|$|R
50|$|The women’s {{personal}} allowance {{was the same}} as the men’s, $5 per month for personal needs in exchange for 56 - 70 hrs work per month on camp work projects. No remittance was sent back home unlike the CCC men’s allowance. The camps were located where a facility had heat, lighting and sanitary conveniences: typically summer hotels, abandoned CCC camps and vacated schools. They were administered by female camp directors, project supervisors, staff teachers and counselors. The average camp had around 100 women, with a supervisory staff of 10-20 including cooks and a nurse. Each enrollee was assigned fixed hours of work on camp assignments, including working in forest nurseries at some camps. Others were making and repairing toys and playground equipment, while some worked at creating visual training aids for public schools. Those with visual disabilities (there were camps for the blind) would make finished bedding or use natural materials to create woven products. Sewing equipment enabled the women to make their own clothing (one popular class was to make dresses from empty cloth feed bags) and no uniforms were required. WPA programs also supplied clothing, and canneries were used as teaching aids and product generation. <b>Layettes</b> and hospital sundries were made for public institutions and other WPA nursing projects. Maintenance of the barracks, housekeeping and kitchen duties (KP) along with instruction in economics and cooking were integral to the residential program which lasted 3-4 months and was not subject to re-enrollment. The Native American women were paid an additional allotment to find rental housing and travelled with the men who went off the reservation to work. No camps were established exclusively for Native American men, so many travelled as a family group. Blacks were still segregated at this time but in their camps were given the same educational opportunities.|$|R
50|$|From {{first grade}} on many {{times of the}} year(for some grades almost everyday) there are {{opportunities}} for community service. Students raise money for charities, give gifts to those less fortunate, and many other things. The older the students get the more responsibility they have. Eighth graders have a group known as E.G.O.(Eighth Grade Organization) which controls a lot (but not all) of which community service activity the school does and when certain fundraisers are. E.G.O. however doesn't control certain activities because certain activities or fundraisers are annual (such as the <b>Layette</b> program or the Ronald McDonald House Collection) and are not changed. Also, E.G.O. doesn't head every project either. For example, the first grade heads a fundraiser {{to raise money for}} Guatemala schools. A.C.T.S.(Association of Catholic Teen Services) is a program that eighth graders can join (but don't have to) which travels around the community doing acts of community service by visiting nursing homes, tutoring under privileged kids, and many other things.|$|E
50|$|Some death trains taking Jewish people, other outspoken people, gypsies, intellectuals, communists, Russian prisoners {{travelled}} through Horni Briza in the Second World War. It was on {{the route}} to Mathausen Extermination camp, further south on the Danube River. On 21 April 1945 a death train stopped here as the line was blocked. The station master intervened and organized the townspeople to cook food and bread for the about 1,000 women being taken to Mathausen - {{this was in the}} dying days of the Third Reich. The station master was Antonin Pavlicek, a devout Catholic. He asked the SS to leave the people there so the town could care for them - they refused. A townswoman gave one of the women who had just given birth her own hand-sown <b>layette</b> planned for her baby. This town was a source of Kaolin (clay). The prisoners were in open wagons and it was very cold and wet.|$|E
50|$|The Coast Guard Mutual Assistance (CGMA) is a tax-exempt {{organization}} of United States Coast Guard people assisting the Coast Guard family, including active duty, retired military, Coast Guard civilian employees, Coast Guard Reserve, Coast Guard Auxiliary, Public Health Service officers serving with the Coast Guard, and surviving family members. There {{are more than}} 400 CGMA Representatives at 97 shore units and 37 cutters based in 32 states and territories, including Puerto Rico and Guam. CGMA receives no federal funds, and relies on bequests and donations from Coast Guard people. Most assistance is provided through interest-free loans and personal grants. These include education assistance programs for members and their dependents, emergency travel, temporary living expenses, funeral expenses, loss of funds or property, disaster relief, medical and dental expenses, home studies expenses for adoptions, and debt management. The Supplemental Education Grant (SEG) program was enhanced in 2015. There is also a <b>Layette</b> Program to welcome infants.

5000|$|Relief Supplies {{formulated}} {{six different}} kits that are sent around the world. Bedding Kits consist of 2 bed sheets, 2 pillow cases, and 2 pillows. Cleaning Buckets contain 17 different items to assist people in cleaning after a flood or hurricane. Health Kits, as described above, provide hygiene supplies to areas where basic sanitary items are unaffordable or unavailable. <b>Layette</b> kits {{are made of}} diapers, baby clothing, and blankets which are {{designed to meet the}} basic non-medical supplies needed directly after childbirth. School Kits are assembled with scissors, paper, a ruler, pencil sharpener, pencils, crayons and an eraser. They are designed to promote learning in areas where educational buildings and supplies are scarce or nonexistent. The final kit that Relief Supplies creates and distributes is the Sewing Kit. Sewing Kits provide recipients with three yards of fabric, scissors, needles, threads, and buttons. Sewing kits are intended to help people learn to create their own clothing instead of simply supplying garments. This kit also promotes cultural preservation by allowing recipients to sew clothing in their own cultural styles. Kit contents change periodically.
