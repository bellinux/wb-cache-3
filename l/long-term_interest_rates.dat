25|$|In an {{open letter}} to the President, the Congress, and the American people, eighty economists, {{including}} Nobel Laureate Vernon L. Smith, stated that the FairTax would boost the United States economy. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research and Americans For Fair Taxation, GDP would increase almost 10.5% in the year after the FairTax goes into effect. Real investments could increase by as much as 76% initially and remain 15% above present levels. In addition, the incentive to work would increase by as much as 20%, the economy’s capital stock would increase by 42%, labor supply by 4%, output by 12%, and real wage rate by 8%. A study in 2007 by the Beacon Hill Institute of Suffolk University stated that within five years real GDP would increase 10.7% over the current system, domestic investment by 86.3%, capital stock by 9.3%, employment by 9.9%, real wages by 10.2%, and consumption by 1.8%. Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University finds that the shift to the FairTax would raise marginal labor productivity and real wages {{over the course of the}} century by 18.9% and long-run output by 10.6%. Further, studies of the FairTax at Boston University and Rice University suggests the FairTax will bring <b>long-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> down by as much as one third. As falling tax compliance costs lower production costs, exports would increase by 26% initially and remain more than 13% above present levels. According to Professor Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University’s Economics Department, revenues to Social Security and Medicare would double as the size of the economy doubles within 15 years after passage of the FairTax. Wall Street Journal columnist James Taranto states the FairTax is unsuited to take advantage of supply-side effects and would create a powerful disincentive to spend money.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2012, due to {{successful}} fiscal consolidation {{and implementation of}} structural reforms in the countries being most at risk and various policy measures taken by EU leaders and the ECB (see below), financial stability in the eurozone has improved significantly and interest rates have steadily fallen. This has also greatly diminished contagion risk for other eurozone countries. [...] only 3 out of 17 eurozone countries, namely Greece, Portugal, and Cyprus still battled with <b>long-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> above 6%. By early January 2013, successful sovereign debt auctions across the eurozone but most importantly in Ireland, Spain, and Portugal, shows investors believe the ECB-backstop has worked.

Some of these conceptual inputs are already available from established portfolio theory, and others represent objects of current or prospective research.

40|$|Few {{financial}} variables are more fundamental than the "risk free" real <b>long-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> because it prices {{the terms of}} exchange over time. During the past 15 years, it has dropped {{from a range of}} 4 to 5 % to a range of 0 to 2 %. By late 2011, cyclical factors had driven it close to zero. This paper explores why. Possible persistent factors are: the investment of the large savings generated by developing Asia in highly-rated bonds; accounting and valuation rules for institutional investment; and financial sector regulation. The consequences could be far-reaching: cheaper leverage; less pressure to correct fiscal deficits; larger <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> exposures in the financial industry; and a more cyclical bond market. During the financial crisis, central banks in the advanced countries have made the <b>long-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> a policy variable as Keynes had always advocated.

Because of the term premium, long-term bond yields tend to be higher than short-term yields and the yield curve slopes upward.

[...] Even if unemployment were [...] "unacceptably high," [...] he suggested that he would vote against the program continuing if inflation inched up a bit: [...] "if inflation were to move up and were to be broadly consistent with the implicit inflation target [...] in different people's minds around this room, even if unemployment were unacceptably high, I think that would be time to stop this program. If inflation expectations were {{to move out of the}} range that they have been in for a long time, that would be a reason to end this program, even if unemployment were exceptionally high and GDP were well below what we think the economy is ultimately capable of."

40|$|The {{determinants}} of <b>long-term</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{have not yet}} been fully explained by either eco-nomic theory or empirical studies. Since <b>long-term</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are the sum of <b>long-term</b> real <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and inflation expectations, any macroeconomic factor that impacts expected infla-tion, real rates or both should affect <b>long-term</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine how the dynamics of nominal bond yields is related to domestic macroeconomic funda-mentals. We consider a structural VECM where identification is achieved by imposing long-run res-trictions. A technical innovation of the paper is the identification of structural stochastic trends in a VECM including exogenous variables, which enables us to address the special features of a small-open economy like Canada. We then assess the impact of various shocks- monetary, fiscal and sup-ply shocks- on nominal bond yields. Our analysis supports the view that domestic macroeconomic policies play a determining role in the long-run dynamics of nominal bond yields. First, an unexpec-ted permanent fiscal deterioration results in large increases in <b>long-term</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Se-cond, a permanent shock to inflation results in higher nominal long rates.
