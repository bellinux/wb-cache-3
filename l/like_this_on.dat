Burnand, wrote to the composer: [...] "Magnificento!...I envy you and W.S.G. being able to place a piece <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>on</b> the stage in so complete a fashion." [...] The opera enjoyed a run longer than any of their other joint works except for H.M.S. Pinafore, Patience and The Mikado. There was a command performance of The Gondoliers for Queen Victoria and the royal family at Windsor Castle in 1891, the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be so honoured. The Gondoliers was Gilbert and Sullivan's last great success.|$|E
500|$|Black and Horn {{realize that}} the killer will have chosen the {{optician}} as his next victim, and agree to set another trap with her as the bait. Horn, more and more unhinged throughout the case, begins imagining the killer and his van at every turn. As he and Black wait for the killer to make an attempt on the optician's life, Horn admits that he cannot trust himself to be there, and is told to go home. However, he parks his car on the route towards the trap, feigning a flat tyre. When the killer's van attempts to pass, Horn attacks him, but the police arrive in time to stop him beating the killer to death. The attack renders any evidence found in the van inadmissible in court, although Black tells him enough evidence was found at the killer's home to secure a conviction. Later, Horn asks Black how he can deal with cases <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>on</b> a regular basis. [...] Black does not answer, but later comforts his daughter after another bad dream.|$|E

Something <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> <b>on</b> the league's biggest stage, on Monday night, it's just {{not good for the}} game.

The killings are generally attributed to Capone, in partnership with Frankie Yale, although these often colorful accounts are sometimes vague and inconsistent but allege that the incident was prearranged. It is {{with the death of}} Lonergan however that the White Hand Gang disappeared from the Brooklyn waterfront allowing Frankie Yale and eventually the Five Families to take control.|$|E

Harold would become only the second actress to act out a birth during a live episode of a soap opera, following Coronation Street's Jennie McAlpine (Fiz Brown) in the live 50th anniversary episode broadcast in December 2010. An insider from the show stated, [...] "No one has tried anything <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>on</b> EastEnders live before so it is a real challenge to get the emotion of the situation right.

2500|$|Among Harrison's biographers, Simon Leng {{comments}} on [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies": [...] "Even though Leonard Cohen and, later, the Smiths {{made a living}} from songs about depression, the justification for recording a piece <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>on</b> what was ostensibly an entertainment product is questionable. This {{is one of the}} few Harrisongs that would have been better left in the can." [...] Dale Allison writes: [...] "A profoundly depressing meditation on despair and suicide … One has trouble imagining anyone enjoying it." [...] Elliot Huntley considers the problem to be the musical arrangement rather than the composition itself, and laments how the Moog and ARP synthesizers [...] "seem to soak the song". Writing for the music website Something Else!, Nick DeRiso opines that, with Extra Texture, Harrison [...] "couldn't have strayed further from his religious moorings – or from the free-spirited uplift that made his initial post-Beatles projects such pleasant surprises", and he dismisses [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies" [...] as [...] "one of [...] most wrist-slashingly awful songs".|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the buildup}} to Sonya and Toadie's wedding, Moloney stated [...] "Toadie is just {{convinced}} that things don't go well {{for him on}} weddings. He's pretty right, really! Lots of things go wrong like venue changes, best men getting ill, Jade {{not being able to}} make it from New York, and all this kind of stuff." [...] Moloney believed that the explosion storyline would rival that of his wedding to Dee. Morey said that she was [...] "pretty upset" [...] when she learned that there would be an explosion on Sonya and Toadie's wedding day. She called the storyline sad, dramatic and big. She later told Vicki Power from the Daily Express, [...] "I've just watched these episodes and I have been bawling my eyes out. It's really heavy, heavy stuff. I've never seen anything <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>on</b> Neighbours."

[...] Variety noted that it was [...] "an expert telling of a supernatural horror story... The climactic {{sequences}} assault the senses and the intellect with pure cinematic terror." [...] In Castle of Frankenstein, Joe Dante called it [...] "an amazing film, and one destined to become at the very least a horror classic. Director Friedkin's film will be profoundly disturbing to all audiences, especially the more sensitive and those who tend to 'live' the movies they see... Suffice it to say, there has never been anything <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>on</b> the screen before." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film a 4-out-of-4 star review, praising the actors (particularly Burstyn) and the convincing special effects {{but at the end of}} the review wrote, [...] "I am not sure exactly what reasons people will have for seeing this movie; surely enjoyment won’t be one, because what we get here aren’t the delicious chills of a Vincent Price thriller, but raw and painful experience. Are people so numb they need movies of this intensity in order to feel anything at all?" ...|$|E
