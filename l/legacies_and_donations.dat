5000|$|The MBAL {{houses a}} {{collection}} of nearly 3,500 graphic artworks, paintings and sculptures. The collection, assembled from gifts, <b>legacies,</b> purchases <b>and</b> <b>donations</b> (notably from the Confederation and the Gottfried Keller Foundation), is spread over more than 150 years, and mainly belongs to the Société des beaux-arts et du musée du Locle. It brings together works by regional, Swiss and international artists, some dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. However, most of the collection consists of works {{from the end of}} the 19th century to the present day.|$|R
500|$|The Trust has no {{endowment}} {{and receives}} no direct government grant.

[...] This is {{in contrast with the}} larger Churches Conservation Trust, which received 70percent of its funding from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and the Church of England but which can only take into care Anglican buildings. [...] At about half of its sites the Trust has formed a volunteer local committee to organise events, arrange occasional services of worship. At others it engages volunteers as key-holders and to assist with the maintenance of sites. [...] Whenever possible and appropriate, the Trust installs modern heating and lighting, kitchens and toilets. In 2012 the Trust declared a temporary moratorium on acquiring new sites unless they are donated together with endowment funds, a policy it will review when finances allow.|$|R

50|$|The Library is {{the most}} {{important}} documentation centre open to the public. Its origins go back to the books referred to by museum technicians in Barcelona when preparing for the 1888 Universal Exhibition. In the early-20th century, the Junta de Museus (Museums Board) decided that the library should be opened to the public, and decisive impetus was given to this initiative when the Special Committee for the Library was set up in 1907. From that year onwards, the library holdings were constantly enriched by <b>legacies</b> <b>and</b> <b>donations</b> from important private libraries.|$|E
50|$|This {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and most {{important}} Florentine welfare institutions which became over the centuries very rich and powerful, thanks to the many <b>legacies</b> <b>and</b> <b>donations.</b> Besides the historical perspective, the hospital has a rich artistic legacy due to the profusion of decorations by some of the best Florentine artists over the centuries. Unfortunately, hospital needs have in many instances come into conflict with the need for conservation of artistic works. As such, there are many masterpieces in museums located nearby, such as Spedale degli Innocenti and San Marco Museum. The hospital was divided into two areas, female (woman's ward) and male (men's ward), and can accommodate about two hundred patients.|$|E
40|$|Among {{the various}} forms of help taken by the people of the Kingdom of Poland to support the poor and the sick as well as not very well-off students, {{testamentary}} <b>legacies</b> <b>and</b> <b>donations</b> were of great significance. In sources dating from 1865 to 1914, information about 170 such legacies intended to serve different charity purposes across Kalisz Province have been found. 1. 2 million roubles have been received from these legacies. There were representatives of gentry, the intellectuals, merchants and wealthy craftsmen among the legators. However, it was the representatives of grand industrial bourgeoisie, mainly of German and Jewish descent, who have made the most substantial legacies. Owing to the charity legacies, many valuable initiatives could be accomplished. In 1899, a Henryk Schlöesser’s House of Gratuitous Apartments and Support was opened in Ozorków. In 1909, a House of Love of God and Neighbour for poor members of Evangelical Church was built in Kalisz and in 1911 a shelter for the Israelites was opened. Legacies by private individuals contributed to opening hospitals in Koło and Warta. Also, several educational institutions emerged in Ozorków, Kalisz, Konin, Wieluń and Lisków. In a situation when Polish people could not expect financial help from the occupant’s administration, the creation of several shelters and educational institutions as well as emergency help for the poor appeared to be an issue of tremendous importance...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to {{works from the}} Spanish royal collection, other holdings increased and enriched the Museum with further masterpieces, such as the two Majas by Goya. Among the now closed museums whose collections {{have been added to}} that of the Prado were the Museo de la Trinidad in 1872, and the Museo de Arte Moderno in 1971. In addition, numerous <b>legacies,</b> <b>donations</b> <b>and</b> purchases have been of crucial importance for the growth of the collection. Various works entered the Prado from the Museo de la Trinidad, including The Fountain of Grace by the School of Van Eyck, the Santo Domingo and San Pedro Martír altarpieces painted for the monastery of Santo Tomás in Ávila by Pedro Berruguete, and the five canvases by El Greco executed for the Colegio de doña María de Aragón. Most of the Museum's 19th-century paintings come from the former Museo de Arte Moderno, including works by the Madrazos, José de Madrazo y Agudo and Federico de Madrazo, Vicente López, Carlos de Haes, Eduardo Rosales and Sorolla.|$|R

40|$|Taxation of bequests <b>and</b> <b>donations</b> is an {{important}} determinant of real estate prices.

We provide a general equilibrium rationalization {{in the context of}} OLG economies featuring intergenerational altruism. This has relevant policy implications. We test the predictions of our theory employing a unique policy shock: the abolition of bequest <b>and</b> <b>donation</b> taxation that took place in Italy in 2001. Considering this policy shift provides the first evidence that a drastic reduction in bequest <b>and</b> <b>donation</b> taxation significantly increased real estate prices. Our estimates suggest that the 2001 abolition of taxation on bequests <b>and</b> <b>donations</b> alone led to an appreciation of residential real estate in excess of 10 %. real estate prices, donations, bequest taxation...|$|R
