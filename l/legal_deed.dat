2500|$|The {{land policy}} of the new nation was conservative, paying special {{attention}} {{to the needs of the}} settled East. The goals sought by both parties in the 1790–1820 era were to grow the economy; avoid draining away the skilled workers needed in the East; distribute the land wisely; sell it at prices that were reasonable to settlers yet high enough to pay off the national debt; clear legal titles; and create a diversified Western economy that would be closely interconnected with the settled areas with minimal risk of a breakaway movement. By the 1830s, however, the West was filling up with squatters who had no <b>legal</b> <b>deed,</b> although they may have paid money to previous settlers. The Jacksonian Democrats favored the squatters by promising rapid access to cheap land. By contrast, Henry Clay was alarmed at the [...] "lawless rabble" [...] heading West who were undermining the utopian concept of a law-abiding, stable middle-class republican community. Rich southerners, meanwhile, looked for opportunities to buy high-quality land to set up slave plantations. The Free Soil movement of the 1840s called for low-cost land for free white farmers, a position enacted into law by the new Republican Party in 1862, offering free 160 acre (65 ha) homesteads to all adults, male and female, black and white, native-born or immigrant.|$|E

Noticing such situation andunderstanding the need to reinstate the legal framework for the regulation of social relationships with respect to the sales contract with buyback agreements, the Romanian lawgiver has dedicated it a subsection in the new Civil Code. The future civil regulation resumes {{a major part of the}} contents and meanings of the provisions of articles 1371 - 1387 of the Civil Code, currently abrogated. The different element lies in the institution of the express prohibition of sales with buyback option where the difference between the pricereceived and the price paid exceeds the level of interests set by the specific legislation. In addition, the sales where the seller has the obligation to buy back the good sold without setting the price of the good at the time of undertaking such obligation are also prohibited.

In this article, by researching Greek acts conserved in various monastic arhives, and confronting them with stipulations in the Byzantine law codes, we question the issues of consensuality of a contract, form of a <b>legal</b> <b>deed,</b> and acquisation of a real right in Byzantine private law. The nature of contracts in Byzantine law has not been sufficiently studied. Richful theoretical studies had been written {{in regards to the}} contract of purchase in Roman and Justinians law, however various and sometimes confronting information from the later Greek codes did not give definite answers to this question. Byzantine codices on this theme encompass already familiar stipulations and legal institutes.
