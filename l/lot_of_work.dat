5|$|Lighting and {{its effect}} on characters' skin was of {{particular}} importance to the Business Division 2 team, with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> going into making sure shading and transparency fitted with each character's position in a scene in relation to its lighting. Previsualization was initially going to be done entirely in-house, but the team eventually decided to bring in The Third Floor, an external company specializing in previsualization. The Third Floor ended up handling around 40% of the work. The animation was also supposed to be handled in-house using the V-Ray software, but the team found it difficult to adapt the software to their needs. As Nozue wanted to use the experience and technology of Visual Works to create Kingsglaive, they decided to bring in experienced and dedicated outside help to handle V-Ray. This resulted in the cooperation with Digic Pictures, which included former staff from Square Enix's North American branch and were highly skilled in the creation of high-quality cutscenes. For procedural environmental elements such as falling rubble, they used the Houdini animation software.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene with}} Peter in the hypnotherapist's office was censored from television, as Peter {{discusses}} his genitals and reproductive organs. When Peter {{comes to the}} realization that Francis is not his real father and when Stewie dreams about being tortured by Lois, a harp sound can be heard; MacFarlane comments that even small things like that take a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> to produce. The alcohol bottles being pushed by the airplane that Peter and Brian are traveling on were animated by computer, as is the taxi driving along the street. On the DVD commentary, MacFarlane notes that the scene would not have looked good without computer aid. He said it makes the animations seem more realistic than without a computer. The two men circling each other for fifty years and waiting for the other to throw the first punch was not broadcast for television.|$|E

25|$|These techniques, {{although}} {{they take a}} long time, involve very little operator intervention and thus are very cheap. Small tumblers (one pound capacity) are available and inexpensive for home/hobbyist use. At {{the other end of}} the scale, professionals can use very large barrels to do a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> at once. The main disadvantage of tumbling is its limited scope - stones will be smooth and have semi-random shapes (like pebbles from the beach), and metals need to be relatively simple shapes, with no fine work.|$|E

25|$|With the $38 million {{deficit of}} the Astrodome, {{control of the}} Astrodomain was passed from Judge Roy Hofheinz to GE Credit and Ford Motor Credit. This {{included}} the Astros.

Tal Smith returned to the Astros from the New York Yankees to find a team that needed a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> {{and did not have}} a lot of money.

25|$|A fervent {{champion}} of the professional cricketer's rights, Shaw did a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> {{in support of his}} contemporaries. He declined to tour with WG Grace in 1873/74 because the professionals in the squad were to be afforded only second-class facilities. In 1881, he led a strike of Notts professionals, demanding a formal contract of employment to guarantee an automatic benefit {{at the end of an}} agreed playing period. The high-handed Nottinghamshire committee thought this absolute anarchy and, apparently justified in its feeling that an amateur skipper was the way to go, dropped every member of the offending faction from the side. There was eventually a reconciliation, however, and Shaw took on the capaincy once more.|$|E

Its main issue was a second possible solution to the problem, seemingly overlooked by Corbet, that would secure nomenclatural stability. Other than suppressing the name ajax, {{it would also be}} possible to select a new type for the name, which would preserve the name for the Nearctic species to which it had been applied for some time.
