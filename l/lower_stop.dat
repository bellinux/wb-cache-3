In the 1910s both success and influence follow the ‘music concerts’ of Igor Severyanin as well as poetry accompanied by Mikhail Kuzmin. However, it was Aleksandr Blok who was influenced the most by eccentric style of an artist and even poet Savoyarov. It’s the most evident in his post-revolutionary works. According to academic Shlovsky few comprehended «The Twelve» poem and condemned it because everyone was used to take Blok seriously only. The Twelve, a portrayal of criminal revolutionary Petrograd, which was compared by Shklovsky to the Bronze Horseman by Pushkin, had brand new images:«...The Twelve is an ironical work.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} the observed Higgs boson mass in the CMSSM, the stops must either be very heavy or the mixing in the stop sector must be very large. <b>Lower</b> <b>stop</b> masses, possibly more accessible at the LHC, still give the correct Higgs mass only if the trilinear stop mixing parameter |At | is in the multi–TeV range. Recently {{it has been shown}} that such large stop mixing leads to an unstable electroweak vacuum which spontaneously breaks charge or color. In this work we therefore go beyond the CMSSM and investigate the effects of including baryon number violating operators λ′′ŪD̄D ̄ on the stop and Higgs sectors. We find that for λ′ ′ ' O(0. 3) light stop masses as low as 220 GeV are consistent with the observed Higgs mass as well as flavour constraints while allowing for a stable vacuum. The light stop in this scenario is often the lightest supersymmetric particle. We furthermore discuss the importance of the one–loop corrections involving R-parity violating couplings for a valid prediction of the light stop masses...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modular approach {{for the design}} of MMIC lumped and transversal filter with LC tuned amplifiers. The filtering improvement due to the introduction of LC tuned amplifier modules (LCTAM) as the transversal element on the conven­tional lumped and transversal structure is illustrated by comparing the performances of a single LCTAM and double LCTAM filters with a conventional one. In order to demonstrate the novel filter usefulness three filters with two transversal sections were implemented with the same typical 0. 5 um GaAs MMIC technology (a conventional, a single and a double LCTAM). It is shown that when we increase the number of LCTAM the rejection increases, however the chip area and complexity also increase. For a 1. 54 GHz centre fre­quency filter, a good compromise is the double LCTAM. This solution on the <b>lower</b> <b>stop</b> band (- 250 MHz) has 15 dB more attenuation than the other two filters and on the upper stop band (+ 250 MHz) has 17 dB and 20 dB more attenuation than the single LCTAM or conventional filter topology, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Although the {{relationship}} between obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and impulsivity has long been debated, impulsivity has not been systematically examined in clinical samples of OCD. Meanwhile, recent findings suggest that impulsivity is multi-dimensional construct that can be examined through several constructs. Therefore, this study is aimed to evaluate multiple facets of impulsivity in OCD. Method: The recruitment includes 80 OCD and 76 healthy control participants. Participants completed a test battery comprising three behavioral tasks of stop signal task (SST), delay discounting task (DDT) and balloon analog risk test (BART), and one self-report measure of the Barratt Impulsiveness scale (BIS- 11). Results: OCD subjects showed significantly <b>lower</b> <b>stop</b> signal reaction time of SST reflecting higher action impulsivity and higher delay discounting parameter of DDT suggesting increased choice impulsivity but significantly lower adjusted mean pump of BART implying lower risk taking propensity of BART than healthy control. Conclusion: Increased Action and choice impulsivity, and decreased risk taking propensities were found in OCD. These findings seem {{to be consistent with}} clinical characteristics of OCD such as greater preference for or avoid risky situations (avoidance), inability to wait tension relief may provoke safety behaviors (compulsion) and inability to stop already started behaviors (repetition) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{search for}} the pair {{production}} of supersymmetric partner of the top quark in scenario with R-parity violation is presented. The quantum number called R-parity distinguishes particles in standard model from supersymmetric particles. A scalar top quark (stop) is assumed to decay only via R{sub p}-violating supersymmetric coupling into tau lepton and b-quark. To collect events with multiple taus, a new special tau trigger (the lepton plus track trigger) is installed in Run II experiment of the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF). The goal of the lepton plus track trigger is to collect generic dilepton ({ell}{ell}, {ell}{tau}, {tau}{tau}) events with lower p{sub T} threshold (8 GeV/c) and without prescale even at high luminosity. The Z {yields} {tau}{tau} event, where one {tau}-lepton decays leptonically and the other hadronically, is a good benchmark to calibrate the lepton plus track trigger and {tau} identification. The data sample of 72 pb{sup - 1 }, collected using the electron plus track trigger, contains clear a {tau} signal from Z {yields} {tau}{tau} events. The data used in stop search correspond to 200 pb{sup - 1 }. The <b>lower</b> <b>stop</b> mass bound of 134 GeV/c{sup 2 } at a 95 % confidence level is obtained.

40|$|Due to a {{high demand}} for {{high-speed}} wireless connectivity applications, the ultra- wide-band (UWB) technology is proposed, having frequency limits of 3. 1 GHz to 10. 6 GHz and a power transmission of - 41 dBm. Since UWB systems are extremely low power, the miniaturization ofUWB systems is desirable. Normal'ry. ttre front-end passive components part (antenna, bandpass filter, and balun circuit) of the UWB systems occupy a large space. Therefore, {{the research and development}} of miniaturised UWB bandpass filters with a high performance {{is the subject of this}} thesis. Based on its attractive features; compactness and low production cost, the E-shape microstrip structure with shorted and open middle stubs is analysed and their equivalent circuits, for the first time, are presented to show their responses. Using the equivalent circuit of the E-shape microstrip structure with shorted middle stub and considering that the input/output ports are directly connected to the structure, several second-order narrow and UWB bandpass filters are researched and developed. The proposed equivalent circuit of the miniaturised E-shape micro strip structure is then generalised for the case of E-shape microstrip structures directly cascaded through very short microstrip line. Several highly compact high-order UWB bandpass filters are developed including third, fifth, and seventh-order bandpass filters. These filters are realized with one transmission zero in the upper stop band attenuation. ill order to increase the <b>lower</b> <b>stop</b> band attenuation, a new design technique generating a transmission zero in the <b>lower</b> <b>stop</b> band too is introduced. This has led to a new generation of miniaturised UWB bandpass filters. These filters are realised using two lower order bandpass filters employing E-shape microstrip structure, coupled through a top-layer providing A. / 4 tight coupling structure. All the simulated examples are fabricated and their responses from measurement, simulation and equivalent circuit are found to be in agreement as discussed in the thesis., Next, the development of notched attenuated band in the UWB pass band is studied. As a result, a novel design technique to generate single and multiple notched bands in the miniaturised UWB bandpass filters employing E-shape microstrip structures is proposed. This is achieved by using IJ 4 short-circuited micro strip resq"na or or the E-shape microstrip structure capacitively coupled to the main filter structure. Generally, the measured results of the design examples are in excellent agreement with the theoretical results. Reasons for any discrepancies are elaborated and discussed. Finally, the realisation of the balance-unbalance (balun) circuit required in UWB systems to connect the passive to active front-end is investigated. Based on a traditional Marchand balun circuit, a technique to design a miniaturised differential ·coupler for UWB bandpass application is presented. In this technique, the Marchand balun circuit is realised in a double layer structure in order to obtain tight coupling for broadband balun. The simulated results for a balun are supported by the practical realisation. The results from measurement and simulation are generally in good agreement.

40|$|Inhibitory control, {{the ability}} to stop or modify preplanned actions under {{changing}} task conditions, {{is an important component}} of cognitive functions. Two lines of models of inhibitory control have previously been proposed for human response in the classical stop-signal task, in which subjects must inhibit a default go response upon presentation of an infrequent stop signal: (1) the race model, which posits two independent go and stop processes that race to determine the behavioral outcome, go or stop; and (2) an optimal decision-making model, which posits that observers decides whether and when to go based on continually (Bayesian) updated information about both the go and stop stimuli. In this work, we probe the relationship between go and stop processing by explicitly manipulating the discrimination difficulty of the go stimulus. While the race model assumes the go and stop processes are independent, and therefore go stimulus discriminability should not affect the stop stimulus processing, we simulate the optimal model to show that it predicts harder go discrimination results in a longer go reaction time (RT), a <b>lower</b> <b>stop</b> error rate, as well as a faster stop-signal RT. We then present novel behavioral data that validate these model predictions. The results thus favor a fundamentally inseparable account of go and stop processing, {{in a manner consistent with}} the optimal model, and contradicting the independence assumption of the race model. More broadly, our findings contribute to the growing evidence that the computations underlying inhibitory control are systematically modulated by cognitive influences in a Bayes-optimal manner, thus opening new avenues for interpreting neural responses underlying inhibitory control...|$|E
40|$|The Higgs pair {{production}} in gluon fusion is a sensitive probe of beyond-Standard Model (BSM) phenomena and its detection {{is a major}} goal for the LHC and higher energy hadron collider experiments. In this work we reanalyze the possible modifications of the Higgs {{pair production}} cross section within low energy supersymmetry models. We show that the supersymmetric contributions to the Higgs pair production cross section are strongly correlated with the ones of the single Higgs production in the gluon fusion channel. Motivated by the analysis of ATLAS and CMS Higgs production data, which allows moderate deviations of the Higgs coupling to gluons with respect to its Standard Model (SM) value, we show that the Higgs pair production may be significantly increased {{with respect to the}} SM predictions. In addition, the scalar superpartner's contribution may lead to significant modification of the di-Higgs invariant mass distribution with respect to the SM predictions. These contributions, however, become small for values of the lightest scalar top-quark (stop) mass significantly above the weak scale and for small values of the stop mixing parameter. They are therefore constrained by the experimental <b>lower</b> <b>stop</b> mass bound and the vacuum stability constraints. We also analyze the combined effects on the di-Higgs production rate of a modification of the Higgs trilinear and top-quark Yukawa couplings in the presence of light stops. In particular, we show that due to the destructive interference of the triangle and box amplitude contributions to the di-Higgs production cross section, even a small modification of the top-quark Yukawa coupling can lead to a significant increase of the di-Higgs production rate.

40|$|Supersymmetry (SUSY) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{appealing}} theories, which tries to explain some of the experimental and theoretical shortcomings of the Standard Model. It tries to solve the Hierarchy problem by introducing new particles (supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model particles). The quantum corrections due to these particles cancel the divergent contribution from the SM particles to the Higgs mass calculation. The top quark couples to the Higgs maximally due to its higher mass. Therefore, particularly, the supersymmetric partner of the top quark- scalar top quark(stop) is interesting for the searches to stabilize the Higgs mass. It is not easy to single out a model in supersymmetry due to the large number of free parameters. So, theorists have come up with some simpliﬁed models, which can be tested experimentally. This thesis is based on one of such models, where a stop decays to a top quark and a neutralino, where neutralino is assumed to be the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP). It is weakly interacting and stable. Hence, it does not leave any trace in the detector contributing to the missingtransverse energy (MET) in the event. This additional source of MET differentiates the signature of tt background from the signature of the signal t̃t̃ events. Some of the popular MET based analyses have been successful in excluding stop particles upto the mass of 900 GeV. But, the lower mass regions still have weaker exclusion limits.
