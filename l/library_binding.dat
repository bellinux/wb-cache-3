25|$|Before the {{computer}} age, the bookbinding trade involved two divisions. First, there was Stationery binding (known as vellum binding in the trade) {{which deals with}} making new books {{to be written into}} and intended for handwritten entries such as accounting ledgers, business journals, blank books, and guest log books, along with other general office stationery such as note books, manifold books, day books, diaries, portfolios, etc. Second was Letterpress binding which deals with making new books intended to be read from and includes <b>library</b> <b>binding,</b> fine binding, edition binding, and publisher's bindings. A result of the new bindings is a third division dealing with the repair, restoration, and conservation of old used bindings. With the digital age, personal computers have replaced the pen and paper based accounting that used to drive most of the work in the stationery binding industry.|$|E
