40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} new edge {{enhancer}} {{based on a}} modified multilayer neural network, which is called a neural edge enhancer (NEE), for enhancing the desired edges clearly from noisy images. The NEE is a supervised edge enhancer: Through training {{with a set of}} input noisy images and teaching edges, the NEE acquires the function of a desired edge enhancer. The input images are synthesized from noiseless images by addition of noise. The teaching edges are made from the noiseless images by performing the desired edge enhancer. To investigate the performance, we carried out experiments to enhance edges from noisy artificial and natural images. By comparison with conventional edge enhancers, the following was demonstrated: The NEE was robust against noise, was able to enhance continuous edges from noisy images, and was superior to the conventional edge enhancers in similarity to the desired edges. To gain insight into the nonlinear kernel of the NEE, we performed analyses on the trained NEE. The results suggested that the trained NEE acquired directional gradient operators with smoothing. Furthermore, we propose a method for edge localization for the NEE. We compared the NEE, together with the proposed edge localization method, with a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>detector.</b> The NEE was proven to be useful for enhancing edges from noisy images.

40|$|Laser {{altimeters}} {{measure the}} time of flight of the laser pulses to determine {{the range of the}} target. The simplest altimeter receiver consists of a photodetector followed by a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>detector.</b> A time interval unit (TIU) measures the time from the transmitted laser pulse to {{the leading edge of the}} received pulse as it crosses a preset threshold. However, the ranging error of this simple detection scheme depends on the received, pulse amplitude, pulse shape, and the threshold. In practice, the pulse shape and the amplitude are determined by the target target characteristics which has to be assumed unknown prior to the measurement. The ranging error can be improved if one also measures the pulse width and use the average of the leading and trailing edges (half pulse width) as the pulse arrival time. The ranging error becomes independent of the received pulse amplitude and the pulse width as long as the pulse shape is symmetric. The pulse width also gives the slope of the target. The ultimate detection scheme is to digitize the received waveform and calculate the centroid as the pulse arrival time. The centroid detection always gives unbiased measurement even for asymmetric pulses. In this report, we analyze the laser altimeter ranging errors for these three detection schemes using the Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter (MOLA) as an example...|$|E

Three <b>edge</b> <b>detectors</b> {{based on the}} mathematical theory introduced are given. Two of the three <b>edge</b> <b>detectors</b> are suggested by the author and one is an implementation of a known <b>edge</b> <b>detector</b> called the Canny <b>edge</b> <b>detector.</b> Our implementation will differ slightly from the original Canny <b>edge</b> <b>detector</b> since in our implementation we use the wavelet transform. All three <b>edge</b> <b>detectors</b> are applied on several images {{and the result is}} discussed. The multiscale behavior of the wavelet transform makes it usefull for edge detection. For small scales it is sensitive to noise, but with good localisation of edges. For large scales it is not as sensitive to noise, but with poorer localisation. One problem when designing an <b>edge</b> <b>detector</b> is to find the scale that have the best trade-off between localisation and noise sensitivity. We suggest an algorithm that automatic selects this scale using information from the wavelet transform across larger scales. The result is an algorithm that works satisfactorily for a set of images that differs in amount of noise and contrast between objects in the image. An <b>edge</b> <b>detector</b> for one-dimensinal signals are given. This <b>edge</b> <b>detector</b> works very well for locating singularities and characterising Lipschitz regularity in one-dimensional signals. However, as an <b>edge</b> <b>detector</b> for images it does not function satisfactorily.
