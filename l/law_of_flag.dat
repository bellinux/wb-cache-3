The war left so many issues unhandled, one such issue is the theme of this thesis, and that is to analyze legal regime that is governing sunken warships. Status of warship still in service is protected by International law and national <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>flag</b> State, stipulating that warships are entitled on sovereign immunity. The question rises whether or not such sovereign immunity status follows warship wreck? Contemporary International law regulates very little considering ‘sovereign wrecks 2 ̆ 7, but customary International law, municipal court decisions and State practices are addressing issue quite profoundly, stating that even the warship is no longer in service it is still entitled on sovereign immunity status. HMAS Perth is Australian owned warship whose wreck current location is within Indonesian Territorial Sea. Recent reports show that commercial salvaging has been done, provoking outrage amongst surviving HMAS Perth 2 ̆ 7 s naval personnel and Australian historians. In order to acquire clear stand point on issue of Sovereign Wrecks legal status, especially of HMAS Perth 2 ̆ 7 s wreck, an in-depth analysis of legal material is necessary...|$|E

40|$|The {{maritime}} transport sector (henceforth shipping sector) {{can be seen}} as the backbone of globalization since it transports 80 % of the merchandise traded internationally (UNCTAD, 2008). It transported about 8. 4 billion tons of merchandise throughout the world in 2010 (UNCTAD, 2011). Needless to say, the shipping sector is a global sector. Over 170 countries are engaged as maritime states (IMO, 2013). Ships are globally mobile and can have multiple nationalities, i. e., ships can be owned and operated by different nationalities, and registered in different countries. Furthermore, ships are subject to multiple regulations, such as the United Nations Convention on the <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> the Sea (UNCLOS), the Conventions of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> the <b>flag</b> states, and the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> the coastal states (Stopford, 2009). Thus, regulating such a global sector is a challenging task. The papers presented in this cumulative dissertation deal with economic aspects of regulating this global sector in two areas of interest. Thus, the dissertation is divided into two parts. Part I (first paper) deals with regulating the transit charges of an interna-tional waterway in the context of price discrimination. Part II (second, third, and fourth paper), which is the main emphasis of the dissertation, deals with regulating CO 2 emissions of the shipping sector in the context of climate change policy...|$|R

The United States determined that the soldiers involved had acted appropriately. Italy disagreed and on February 7, 2007, Mario Lozano, an U. S.
