40|$|Background: In recent years, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has {{proposed}} implementing a standardized over-the-counter (OTC) medicine label. However, there were mixed consumer opinions regarding a label proposed in 2012 and limited evidence demonstrating the usability of the revised (2014) format. Objective: To develop {{and examine the}} usability of alternative OTC medicine <b>label</b> <b>formats</b> for standardization, and explore consumer perspectives on the labels. Materials and methods: Four alternative labels were developed for the exemplar medicine diclofenac. One {{was based on the}} Medicine Information label proposed by the TGA (‘Medicine Information’), one was based on the U. S. Drug Facts label (‘Drug Facts’), and two were based on suggestions proposed by consumers in the earlier needs analysis phase of this research (referred to as the ‘Medicine Facts’ and ‘Consumer Desires’ <b>label</b> <b>formats).</b> Five cohorts of 10 participants were recruited. Each cohort was assigned to user test one of the alternative labels or an existing label for a proprietary diclofenac product (which acted as a comparator) for diagnostic purposes. Each participant then provided feedback on all 5 labels. Each interview consisted of the administration of a user testing questionnaire, measuring consumers’ ability to find and understand key points of information, and a semi-structured interview exploring consumer perspectives. Results: Overall, all 4 alternative <b>label</b> <b>formats</b> supported consumers’ ability to find and understand key points. The existing comparator label was the poorer label with respect to participants’ ability to find and understand key points. Factors such as perceived usability, color, design, content, and/or content ordering impacted consumer preferences. The ‘Consumer Desires’ or ‘Drug Facts’ <b>label</b> <b>formats</b> were most often preferred by consumers for use as the standardized OTC label over the TGA proposed format. Conclusions: All alternative <b>label</b> <b>formats</b> demonstrated satisfactory usability and could be considered for use in OTC label standardization. User testing of OTC labels and consumer feedback received as part of the testing process can assist in the refinement of OTC labeling to ensure that implemented policies are evidence-based...|$|R
40|$|Providing {{consumers}} with usable nutrition information requires an effective <b>labeling</b> <b>format.</b> The {{objective of this}} study, which was conducted in a supermarket setting, {{was to determine whether}} consumers could, without previous instruction, make equally effective nutrition decisions using a graphic format based on nutrient density as when using the current <b>labeling</b> <b>format.</b> For comparison with other studies, a demographic, nutrition knowledge and nutrition labeling data base was collected. The questionnaire completed by each participating consumer included items regarding demographic data and shopping preferences, and questions evaluating nutrition knowledge for comparison as a data base with other studies. It also appraised the ability of the shopper to utilize two nutrition <b>labeling</b> <b>formats</b> in making nutrition decisions. Another questionnaire, completed by a researcher, assessed race, body type and build, and time taken by each participant to complete the nutrition decision questions. Six supermarkets were selected from one large Utah chain as sites for the survey. The nutrient density format produced the greatest percentage of correct responses. The difference was particularly evident when the data were analyzed for overall total correct responses. Participants who were high school graduates or had family incomes between $ 4, 000 - $ 7, 999 made more correct responses when utilizing the nutrient density format than when confronted with the other format. The nutrient density presentation also took less time for participants to complete. The graphical nutrient density format evaluated in the study is more effective than the current <b>labeling</b> <b>format</b> in assisting consumers to make valid nutritional decisions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Nutrition {{labels are}} a {{potentially}} valuable tool to assist consumers in making healthy food choices. Front-of-pack labels are {{a relatively new}} format and are now widely used across many European countries, but it is unclear which of the many formats in use are best understood by consumers. It is also unclear whether the existence of multiple formats impedes understanding and use. This article addresses this question with findings from a study commissioned by the UK Food Standards Agency to provide evidence to inform policy decisions in this area. METHODS: In-depth qualitative interviews were used to explore consumers' decision-making processes when using two different front-of-pack <b>label</b> <b>formats</b> to judge the relative healthiness {{of a pair of}} products. Participants were presented with product pairs differently labelled and a series of structured prompts were used to access their internal dialogues and to identify any difficulties encountered. RESULTS: The interviews revealed that making product comparisons using different <b>label</b> <b>formats</b> was challenging for participants and particularly for those product pairs where there was not an obvious answer. When the <b>label</b> <b>formats</b> on the product pairs lacked a common element, such as text, this also caused difficulties and misinterpretation. The comparisons also took time and effort that would be a deterrent in real-life situations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the existence of multiple front-of-pack <b>label</b> <b>formats</b> in the marketplace may impede consumer comprehension and discourage use. They suggest that a single format may encourage consumers to use front-of-pack labels in making healthy food choices...|$|R

Three types of competitive ELISA {{have been developed to}} detect the binding activity of mAb molecules. In the first <b>format,</b> <b>labeled</b> <b>Format</b> B in Fig.  2 A, specific antigens are coated on the surface of 96 -well plate. Serially diluted test mAbs are premixed with a constant labeled standard. There is a competition of binding ability between the test mAb and standard. The second competitive ELISA, <b>labeled</b> <b>Format</b> C in Fig.  2 A, uses a standard mAb as coating. A serially diluted test mAb is premixed with a labeled antigen, with an equal amount in the different wells. Both assays are useful to analyze the quality of mAbs through the measurement of IC 50 values. In addition, if an antigen-specific ligand could be achieved, a ligand blocking assay-based competitive ELISA could be established. The ligand blocking assay, <b>labeled</b> <b>Format</b> D in Fig.  2 A, is similar to Format B, but the labeled antibody is replaced with a labeled binding molecule of the ligand.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 52 - 56) The {{purpose of}} this study, modeled after {{a study conducted by}} Antonuk and Block (2006), was to investigate how the indication of the format and total caloric/nutrition contents of an entire food package on the food label affects consumers??? understanding of nutritional information and their dietary decision-making. The 100 undergraduate students who participated in this study were {{randomly assigned to one of}} six conditions. The first independent variable was the healthiness of the snack, featuring a healthy snack or a less healthy snack. The second independent variable was the label type on the package, consisting of the dual-column label, single-column <b>label,</b> and no-label <b>formats.</b> The dual-column <b>label</b> <b>format</b> contains both single- serving nutritional information as well as entire-package nutritional information, while the single-column nutrition fact label contains only single-serving nutritional information. The study involved five dependent variables: 1) comprehension level; 2) characteristic awareness level; 3) level of motivation to process the labels in the single-column and dual-column label conditions; 4) nutrition fact <b>label</b> <b>format</b> favorability; and 5) dietary choice. Each participant received a bag containing a snack as well as a questionnaire that contained a copy of the nutrition fact label from the snack. In addition, the participants were given a series of questions regarding the snacks??? nutritional information presented on the labels, and they were instructed to pay attention to the nutrition fact labels to fill out the questionnaire. After this initial exercise, the participants watched a short comedy video clip and proceeded to answer the post-test questionnaire. As was hypothesized, the dual-column nutrition label performed significantly better in terms of accurately estimating calorie and protein counts compared to those with the single-column and the no-label formats. However, the use of dual-column labels was not effective in terms of helping the participants to estimate accurate serving sizes or fat and fiber counts; thus, these findings did not support the hypothesis. In addition, unlike the initial hypothesis, the dual-column arrangement did not have a significant effect in reference to increasing the level of motivation of participants to evaluate the labels. In addition, the participants who were given the dual-column label did not eat a significantly smaller amount of snacks compared to the participants with the other <b>label</b> <b>formats.</b> The results in the current study suggest that the dual-column <b>label</b> <b>format,</b> which supplies good situational cues, is partially effective in the estimation of nutritional content but failed to show effectiveness in other areas. Future studies should assess the dual-column label???s limitations while examining the effectiveness of the dual-column label combined with other graphical and/or pictorial cues that may improve the effectiveness of the dual-column label...|$|R

Themes originating from the content analysis of the transcriptions were organised around four possible menu labelling formats: 1) numerical information on calories; 2) numerical information on calories and nutrients; 3) traffic light system plus Guideline Daily Amounts; 4) food information with ingredients list plus highlighted symbols. Results In both countries, participants preferred the ingredients list plus symbols format, considered more comprehensive and useful to make an informed food choice. Organic food and vegetarian symbols were the ones considered most important to appear on restaurant menu labels with ingredients list.
