5000|$|The Chatham {{class were}} 458 ft long overall, with {{a beam of}} 49 ft and a draught of 16 ft. Displacement was 5400 LT normal and 6000 LT full load. [...] The belt {{consisted}} of 2 in of nickel-steel on top of 1 in of high-tensile steel, tapering from 3 - 2+1/2 in forward and to 2 in aft. It covered from 8.25 - 10.5 ft above the waterline to 2.5 ft below it. This belt {{was part of the}} <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>structure</b> of the ship, reducing the overall weight of structure required. A thin armoured deck, 3/8 in over most of its length and 1+1/2 in over the steering gear, was retained, mainly as a watertight deck. The ships forecastle was again extended aft, reaching two-thirds of the length of the ship, and allowing two more guns to be raised up onto the forecastle, while the ships metacentric height was reduced, making the ships better gun platforms. Officers accommodation was moved back {{to the rear of the}} ships in this class. Machinery layout was again similar to the earlier Towns, with one ship, Southampton, having a two-shaft layout. It was rated at [...] giving a speed of 25.5 kn. While main armament again consisted of eight 6 in guns in single mountings, a new gun, the BL 6 inch Mk XII was used. This was shorter and lighter than the Mk XI guns used in earlier ships, and while range was slightly less (14000 yd compared to 14600 yd), they were much easier to handle in rough weather and were more accurate. They had larger magazines, giving up to 200 rounds per gun rather than 150 in earlier ships. The remaining armament was unchanged.|$|E

40|$|Masonry walls {{constituted}} {{of solid}} concrete blocks are used very commonly in the framed structures {{as well as}} in the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>structures</b> in various parts of Pakistan. However, very limited understanding on the characteristics and behavior of this type of masonry walls, particularly from the perspective of the seismic design and assessment, is available. This paper attempts to investigate the important characteristics, such as strength and stiffness, of the walls constructed from two grades/types of these blocks, referred as Type- 1 and Type- 2 blocks. The dimensions of Type- 1 and Type- 2 blocks are 300 x 200 x 150 mm and 300 x 200 x 100 mm, respectively. Compressive strength, bond strength, coefficient of friction, and diagonal (shear) strength of the masonry blocks and its assemblages are obtained from detailed experimental work. In the due course, the influence of the presence of the plaster on the masonry prisms made of two and three blocks subjected to compression and shear force respectively are investigated. The outcomes of the experimental investigation presented herein can be used effectively in macro and micro modelling of infill in framed structures as well as <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

40|$|DendroLight {{is a novel}} wood {{material}} primarily used as {{core material}} for furniture industry. The manufacturing of this material was started at the year 2010 in Ventspils. It is made from profiled/perforate wood boards stacked in perpendicular layers and then sliced once more in plates perpendicularly to the board’s layers. The main advantage of such a solution is significant reduction of structural weight (up to 40 %) comparing to conventional timber. Material properties are not fully assessed jet, however first experimental test runs demonstrate that it has sufficient stiffness for the use as core material in wood sandwich panels in <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>structures</b> like walls and floors[1]. For further development of <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>structures</b> with DendroLight core, reliable design methodology is needed, able to assess detailed geometry component (like profiled board web thickness) influence over the stiffness for large scale structure. In current research several numerical modeling techniques have been compared including numerical models from shell and solid elements in ANSYS and ABAQUS software. The aim is to elaborate an accurate numerical model for prediction of DendroLight structure mechanical behavior.

40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>structure</b> of {{an existing}} multi storey office building in Celje. The <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>structure</b> is made of reinforced concrete, based on strip and isolated foundation footings, slabs, columns and walls. It is analysed with the programme Tower 7, which utilises the final elements method. Two computational models of the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>structure</b> are built. The first one is used to analyse the typical ceiling construction in the building. Besides the slab, we also include some vertical load bearing elements {{above and below the}} slab into the model. To analyse the vertical load bearing elements we create a more complex three-dimensional computational model of the whole load bearing construction. The ceiling slab analysis takes into account both the dead load as well as the live load. The analysis of the whole <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>structure</b> also includes snow load and the horizontal effects of wind and earthquake. The dynamic effect is determined by the means of a linear modal analysis with a response spectrum. The core of the thesis is represented in the analysis and the dimensioning of typical load bearing elements in the building. Firstly, dimensioning of the lower and upper reinforcement is executed. The calculation results are compared to the amount of built-in reinforcement, information about which is gathered from the original project documentation that followed the old PBAB regulation. Next, is the dimensioning of wall AB and column AB. The reinforcement for both is constructed in accordance with ductile behaviour requirements. The results show that the existing wall and column reinforcements only partially satisfy the requirements of evrokod regulations currently in place...|$|E
