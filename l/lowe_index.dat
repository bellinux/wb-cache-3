[...] "A Lowe price index is distinguished from [...] Laspeyres index by the separation of the weight reference (or expenditure base) period and price reference (or link) period." [...] Lowe indexes are named for economist Joseph Lowe (economist). [...] Most CPIs and employment cost indexes from Statistics Canada, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and many other national statistics offices are Lowe indexes.|$|E

This paper focuses on whether the BLS can improve upon the headline CPI-U’s current biennial weight update process, thereby reducing the CPI-U’s growth rate and bringing the index closer to the C-CPI-U. We begin by estimating superlative price indexes for 1999 through 2007 along with indexes based on the constant-elasticity-of-substitution demand model. Our analyses confirm that the consumer expenditure data underlying the CPI imply substantial consumer substitution, implying that the CPI-U’s <b>Lowe</b> <b>index</b> formula yields higher inflation estimates than would a true COLI. Simulating feasible weight update processes, we find that a <b>Lowe</b> <b>index</b> with two-year weight reference periods but annual updating rises by about 0. 03 percentage points less per year than the CPI-U. Another 0. 01 percentage point on average is subtracted by imposing annual revision with one-year base periods. Thus, indexes with more timely weights may offer improved representation of current price change, as well as closer approximations to a COLI.

40|$|Catching {{the effect}} of {{substitution}} behaviour in a Consumer Price Index (CPI) as good as possible is a goal pursued by statistical agencies throughout the world. The difference between a CPI and a certain target cost-of-living index is called substitution bias. Balk and Diewert (2003) considered the substitution bias of a Lowe Consumer Price Index; see also CPIManual (2004 : Chapter 17). The present paper considers the substitution bias of a Cobb-Douglas (or Geometric Young) CPI, and compares the two price indices {{with respect to their}} substitution bias. It appears difficult to draw a clear-cut conclusion. Index number, cost-of-living index, <b>Lowe</b> <b>index,</b> Cobb-Douglas index, Geometric Young index...|$|E
40|$|Productivity and profitability, {{in levels}} and changes, are {{measured}} with various indices. In {{addition to the}} classic Malmquist productivity index, the 'productivity' package contains also the multiplicatively complete Fisher, Laspeyres, Paasche, Färe-Primont and <b>Lowe</b> <b>indices.</b> Färe-Primont and <b>Lowe</b> <b>indices</b> verify the transitivity property and can therefore be used for multilateral or multitemporal comparison. Malmquist, Fisher, Laspeyres and Paasche indices not transitive and are only {{to be used for}} binary comparison. All indices can also be decomposed into different components providing insightful information on the sources of productivity and profitability improvements. In the use of Malmquist productivity index, the technological change index is further decomposed into bias technological change components. In the case of the Fisher, Laspeyres, Paasche and the transitive Färe-Primont and <b>Lowe</b> <b>indices,</b> it is furthermore possible to rule out technological change. The package also allows to prohibit negative technological change. All the estimations are based on the nonparametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and several assumptions regarding returns to scale are available (i. e. CRS, VRS, NIRS, NDRS). The package allows parallel computing as an option, depending on the user's computer configuration...|$|R
40|$|Profitability {{change can}} be {{decomposed}} into {{the product of a}} total factor productivity (TFP) index and an index of relative price change. O’Donnell (2008) shows that the TFP index can be further decomposed into an index of technical change and various indexes of efficiency change – these indexes measure changes in productivity resulting from movements in the production frontier, movements by firms towards the frontier, and movements by firms around the frontier to capture economies of scale and scope. The O’Donnell decomposition methodology can be applied in any multiple-input multiple-output setting, it makes no assumptions concerning the optimising behaviour of firms or the degree of competition in product markets, and it only involves components that can be unambiguously interpreted as measures of either technical change or efficiency change. This paper uses the methodology to decompose spatially - and temporally-transitive <b>Lowe</b> <b>indexes</b> of TFP change in U. S. agriculture for the period 1960 - 2004. To implement the methodology, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to estimate separate production frontiers for each of the ten farm production regions identified by the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS). California and Florida are found to be the most profitable and productive states. In most states, the main drivers of TFP change over the 45 -year study period appear to have been technical change and scale and mix efficiency change. For example, Texas is found to have experienced a 40 % increase in productivity due to technical change and a 32 % increase in productivity due to economies of scale and scope, resulting in an overall productivity increase of 1. 40 ! 1. 32 – 1 = 85 %; in Tennessee, the combined effects of technical progress (122 %), technical efficiency improvement (1 %) and diseconomies of scale and scope (- 24 %) resulted in an net productivity increase of 2. 22 ! 1. 01 ! 0. 76 – 1 = 70 %. ...|$|R
40|$|The price indices have a {{long history}} and a large variety of uses, from the {{adjustment}} of the wages, pensions and payments included in a long-term contract, the deflation of aggregates in National Accounts, to the elaboration of economic policies. Having identified the purpose of the index, we`ll have to choose the target index and the calculation formula, this operation being carried out based on the observed prices and on the quantity and quality weights. In the statistical practice, the price index is often calculated by aggregating the elementary indices using the weighted arithmetic mean, using annual weights from a period that is previous to the reference period. In this situation, the question about the possible impact of the weights update (by prices) on the interpretation of price indices becomes legitimate, also the question about the influence of using this approach on measuring the price change. We can get a possible answer to this question using the <b>Lowe</b> and Young <b>indices</b> introduced by the Consumer Price Index international manual...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} the effects of {{different}} frequencies and implementation months of basket updates on the fixed-basket price index – the <b>Lowe</b> <b>index,</b> through theoretical analysis and empirical simulation using Canadian data from 2000 to 2013. We find that both an increased frequency of basket updates and a faster implementation of these new baskets will reduce substitution bias in the CPI. However, we also find that improvements to the method of accelerating frequency has diminishing marginal returns in practice – as each subsequent increase in the frequency with which the CPI basket is updated has a less pronounced effect; and the ideal link-month when a new basket is implemented is unpredictable, since the impact of the implementation lag depends upon the consistency between short-term price movements and long-term price trends...|$|E
40|$|Fishing fleets {{are subject}} to {{numerous}} factors that affect economic performance, making identification and attribution of such impacts difficult. This paper separately identifies the effects of changing input and output prices, fishery management, and quota allocations on total factor productivity using a <b>Lowe</b> <b>Index.</b> Indices account for technical change and decompose productivity estimates into its technical, environmental, and scale-mix components. This results in measures that reflect shifts in the production frontier, and movements by vessels toward and around the frontier, to capture economies of scale and mix after a policy shift to a catch share program that includes fishing cooperatives and a limited access fishery. The difference between cooperative and limited access vessels is exploited to compare the changes in economic performance between the groups after {{the introduction of the}} shift to catch shares and cooperative management, which allowed the vessels to improve the timing and coordination across multi-species fisheries and to decrease incidental catch of quota-limited bycatch species that had closed the target fisheries prematurely in the past. Results indicate that total factor productivity increased significantly after the move to a catch share program, largely due to increases in technical change that shifted out the production frontier of the fishery...|$|E
