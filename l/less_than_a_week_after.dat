5|$|Mason {{had long}} battled against Alexandria merchants who he felt unfairly {{dominated}} the county court, {{if only because}} they could more easily get to the courthouse. In 1789, he drafted legislation to move the courthouse {{to the center of}} the county, though it did not pass in his lifetime. In 1798, the legislature passed an authorizing act, and the courthouse opened in 1801. Most of those at Gunston Hall, both family and slaves, fell ill during the summer of 1792, experiencing chills and fever; when those subsided, Mason caught a chest cold. When Jefferson visited Gunston Hall on October 1, 1792, he found Mason, long a martyr to gout, needing a crutch to walk, though still sound in mind and memory. Additional ailments, possibly pneumonia, set in. <b>Less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>after</b> Jefferson's visit, on October 7, George Mason died at Gunston Hall, and was subsequently buried on the estate, within sight of the house he had built and of the Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, in {{an effort}} to defuse the racial {{tensions}} caused by the sit-ins, Mayor West announced the formation of a Biracial Committee to seek a solution to the city's racial strife. The committee included the presidents of two of the city's black universities, but did not include any representatives from the student movement. The committee met several times over the next month and delivered its recommendations in a report on April 5. The committee recommended to partially integrate the city's lunch counters. Each store would have one section that was for whites only and another section for whites and blacks. This solution was rejected by the student leaders, who considered the recommendations to be morally unacceptable and based upon a policy of segregation. <b>Less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>after</b> the Biracial Committee issued its report, the sit-ins resumed and the boycott of downtown businesses was intensified.|$|E

At Capitol Punishment on June 19, Orton defeated Christian to retain the title despite illegally pinning Christian. On the June 24 episode of SmackDown, Christian demanded another attempt at the title from SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long; his demand was granted {{with the proviso that}} he could defeat Kane. Christian lost the match against Kane by disqualification after interference from Mark Henry. Long then made a tag team match for later that same episode, pitting the team of Christian and Henry against Kane and Orton with a similar stipulation; Henry pinned Orton in the bout. Afterward, Long offered Henry an attempt at the title if Henry could defeat Orton again. Henry lost the match after Christian engineered a distraction. This set up a match between Orton and Christian for the title at Money in the Bank. On the July 8 episode of SmackDown, Christian's lawyers in the storyline added a stipulation to the match that if Orton was disqualified or there were poor officiating, he would lose the title to Christian.|$|E
