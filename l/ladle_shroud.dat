Several electromagnetic, thermal, or radiation sensors at the <b>ladle</b> <b>shroud,</b> tundish and mould sense the metal level or weight, flow rate and {{temperature of the}} hot metal, and the programmable logic controller (PLC) can set the rate of strand withdrawal via speed control of the withdrawal rolls.

40|$|The {{onset of}} a 'late' {{rotating}} vortex over an off-centre drain nozzle at 2 / 3 radius was studied in an 1160 -mm diameter tank. It {{was found that}} using a sloped bottom ladle could be beneficial in terms of steel yield, provided the exit nozzle is located 'centrically'. Miner modification of the nozzle (skewed nozzle) to impart a radial component of velocity to the spinning vortex core {{was found to be}} effective in making AMEPA system sensitive to early slag entrainment phenomena by diverting the core away from the central vertical axis of the nozzle. A 0. 75 scale water model was constructed to simulate the flow of liquid steel through a <b>ladle</b> <b>shroud</b> in the presence of gas infiltration. It was found that the <b>ladle</b> <b>shroud</b> slag detector could be temporarily 'blinded' by gas bubbles or permanently blinded by a standing submerged gas jet...|$|E
40|$|To further remove mini-size {{nonmetallic}} inclusions {{and improve}} surface quality {{of stainless steel}} slab at No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of Shanxi Taigang Stainless Steel Company Limited, the flow field and temperature profile of molten stainless steel in an asymmetrical T-type single-strand continuous casting tundish with a capacity of 18 - 20 tons have been investigated by both hydrodynamic and mathematical simulations. The influences of height for low-wall of turbulence inhibitor, dam height, weir depth, distance between dam and weir, submerged depth of <b>ladle</b> <b>shroud</b> and casting speed on flow field in the tundish have been studied in a 1 : 3 reduced scale hydrodynamic model. The streamlines, velocity vector fields and temperature profiles are also mathematically simulated. The hydrodynamic modelling results indicate that height for low-wall of turbulence inhibitor, dam height and weir depth are three important structural parameters on flow field of molten stainless steel in the tundish. The optimization of the three parameters can improve dispersed plug zone and reduce dead zone effectively. Changing casting speed can improve turbulent flow, and thus reduce dead zone of molten stainless steel in the tundish. As a result, five groups of optimized structural parameters of the tundish have been recommended, which can reduce volume fraction of dead zone down to 15 - 30 % and increase volume fraction of dispersed plug zone to more than 20 %. In addition, it is verified that the optimized groups of structural parameters of the tundish can maintain their advantage at different casting speeds in a narrow range. The mathematical modelling results suggest that heat losses around the tundish {{must be considered in}} order to accurately simulate the streamline, velocity vector field and temperature profile. The calculated temperature drop of molten stainless steel between inlet and outlet of the tundish is about 4. 4 K; the maximum temperature drop in the whole tundish is about 10 K, The modification of flow filed by changing structural parameters of the tundish can slightly affect temperature profile of molten stainless steel in the tundish.

The optimal structural parameters of arch hole(s) at dam bottom {{can be obtained from}} hydrodynamic modeling as that two arch holes with 30 ?mm as height and 50 ?mm as radius are symmetrically dug at dam bottom with the distance between arch hole center and dam center as 205 ?mm; or the optimal structural parameters of round hole(s) can be recommended as that one round hole with 70 ?mm as diameter is dug at left of the dam bottom with the distance between hole center and dam center as 205 ?mm. The results of mathematical simulation suggest that digging arch or round hole(s) at dam bottom with above-mentioned structural parameters cannot obviously induce negative effects on streamlines and velocity vector profiles of molten stainless steel in the tundish by short circuit flow via arch or round hole(s) at dam bottom. The calculated temperature drop of molten stainless steel between the submerged <b>ladle</b> <b>shroud</b> and submerged entry nozzle in the tundish with arch or round hole(s) at dam bottom is about 3. 0 ?K, the maximum temperature drop of molten stainless steel in the tundish is about 6. 0 ?K.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of trumpet-shaped ladle shrouds (TLS) have been frequently demonstrated over conventional straight-bore ladle shrouds (CLS) {{with respect to}} production efficiency and molten steel quality in continuous casting practices. The present study is to shed some lights on why the TLS are better than the CLS design by examining the fluid dynamics and mass transfer using large eddy simulation. The obtained numerical results were validated with particle imaging velocimetry experiments. Flow velocity, deformation, turbulent energy dissipation, and mixing kinetics of tracer were discussed. The {{results showed that the}} entering jet of the CLS flowed straight down into the tundish with a relatively high speed (average at 0. 710 to 0. 815 m/s) and turbulent kinetic energy. However, the trumpet section of a TLS intensified velocity differences, strain rates, and vortices, and promoted an increase on turbulence dissipation rate in the interior of the <b>ladle</b> <b>shroud.</b> The average speed of the entering jet to the tundish was decreased to 0. 270 to 0. 410 m/s from the 0. 708 m/s of the inlet speed. The entering jet from the TLS swung, twisted and well mixed with surrounding fluid in the tundish, and dissipated its kinetic energy. Consequently, the turbulence of the whole flow field as well as the mean skin friction coefficient of tundish wall and the velocity of free liquid surface were reduced. A tracer experiment was carried out to study mass transfer and flow mixing behavior, and the results demonstrated that the use of the TLS increased the plug volume and decreased the dead zone, thereby enhancing inclusion flotation...|$|E
