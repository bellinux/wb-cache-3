50|$|Rabbits are {{particularly}} vulnerable to the rabies virus. The virus is often contracted when attacked by other rabid animals and can incubate within a rabbit for up to 2-3 weeks. Symptoms include weakness in <b>limbs,</b> <b>head</b> tremors, nasal discharge, low of appetite, nasal discharge and death within 3-4 days. However, there are currently no vaccines available for rabbits. It is recommended that rabbits be kept indoors or enclosed in hutches outside that do not allow other animals to {{come in contact with}} them. In the 1880s, rabbits were used to develop the first rabies vaccine by Louis Pasteur.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interosseous}} sacroiliac ligament is a ligament of the {{sacroiliac joint}} that lies deep to the posterior ligament, {{and consists of}} a series of short, strong fibers connecting the tuberosities of the sacrum and ilium. It is the strongest ligament in the body. The major function of the interosseous sacroiliac ligament is to keep the sacrum and ilium together and therefore prevent abduction or distraction of the sacroiliac joint. It also helps to bear the weight of the thorax, upper <b>limbs,</b> <b>head,</b> and neck. This is performed by the nearly horizontal direction of the fibers running perpendicular from the sacrum to the ilium.|$|R

The cells were isolated from tissues by vigorously pipetting, and the trypsin was neutralized with DMEM containing 10 % FBS. After incubation at 37 °C, 5 % CO 2 for 24 – 48 h until 100 % confluence, the cells were harvested and marked as passage 0. MEF cells of passage 3 – 5 {{were used in the}} experiments.|$|R
50|$|All fighters must wear {{historical}} steel armour that encloses the torso, <b>limbs,</b> <b>head</b> & neck, & hands, {{and beneath}} this a padded layer, {{known as a}} gambeson. Helmets must be analogous {{to the rest of}} the armour, must cover the face and must be closed with a strap to prevent removal during combat. All armour must be of a style traceable to a historical period and location, no piece may date from more than 50 years of another. Fighters may wear a supplementary third layer of protective equipment beneath their gambeson, provided it is not visible and does not replace any armour above it, such as a Protective Cup or mouthguard.|$|R
5000|$|From August 1939 the Interior Ministry began {{registering}} {{children with}} disabilities, requiring doctors and midwives to report all cases of newborns with severe disabilities; the 'guardian' consent element soon disappeared. Those {{to be killed}} were identified as [...] "all children under three years of age in whom {{any of the following}} 'serious hereditary diseases' were 'suspected': idiocy and Down syndrome (especially when associated with blindness and deafness); microcephaly; hydrocephaly; malformations of all kinds, especially of <b>limbs,</b> <b>head,</b> and spinal column; and paralysis, including spastic conditions". The reports were assessed by a panel of medical experts, of whom three were required to give their approval before a child could be killed.|$|R

40|$|A unique {{behavioural}} syndrome {{in humans}} followed two separate strokes involving both parietotemporal regions. The behavioural alterations {{resemble those of}} Denny-Brown and Chambers' monkey with bilateral ablation of the parietal lobe which were characterised by strong withdrawal or refusal to be touched on the <b>limbs</b> and <b>head.</b> In both humans and animals, touch on the <b>limbs</b> or <b>head</b> elicited exaggerated withdrawal movements and refusal to be touched on the lips and tongue resulted in difficulty in feeding. These behavioural alterations {{can be interpreted as}} loss of exploratory activities towards extrapersonal space, or more positively, as rejection of contact with the environment. This rejection behaviour in which tactile, visual, and/or gustatory exploration tendencies are altered, is a counterpart of human frontal lobe syndrome and human Klüver-Bucy syndrome...|$|R

50|$|Evidence of {{exposure}} to OP pesticides during gestation and early postnatal period {{have been linked to}} neurodevelopmental effects in animals, specifically rats. Animals exposed in utero to chlorpyrifos exhibited decreased balance, poorer cliff avoidance, decreased locomotion, delays in maze performance, and increased gait abnormalities. Early gestation is believed to be a critical time period for the neurodevelopmental effects of pesticides. OP's affect the cholinergic system of fetuses, so exposure to chlorpyrifos during critical periods of brain development potentially could cause cellular, synaptic, and neurobehavioral abnormalities in animals. In rats exposed to methyl parathion, studies found reduced AChE activity in all brain regions and subtle alterations in behaviors such as locomotor activity and impaired cage emergence. Organophosphates as whole have been linked to decreases in the length of <b>limbs,</b> <b>head</b> circumference, and slower rates of postnatal weight gain in mice.|$|R

Her skeptical co-workers called her parents, who thought they rescued her the following day by physically removing her from the house; Homolka went back in, frantically searching for something. Her parents took her to St. Catharines General Hospital (where her injuries were documented), she gave a statement to the NRP that she was a battered spouse and filed charges against Bernardo. He was arrested, and later released on his own recognizance. A friend who found Bernardo's suicide note intervened, and Homolka moved in with relatives in Brampton.|$|R
