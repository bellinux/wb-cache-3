25|$|Some high-activity LLW {{requires}} shielding during {{handling and}} transport but most LLW {{is suitable for}} shallow land burial. To reduce its volume, it is often compacted or incinerated before disposal. <b>Low-level</b> <b>waste</b> is divided into four classes: class A, class B, class C, and Greater Than Class C (GTCC).|$|E
25|$|Moderate {{amounts of}} <b>low-level</b> <b>waste</b> are {{produced}} through chemical and volume control system (CVCS). This includes gas, liquid, and solid waste produced {{through the process}} of purifying the water through evaporation. Liquid waste is reprocessed continuously, and gas waste is filtered, compressed, stored to allow decay, diluted, and then discharged. The rate at which this is allowed is regulated and studies must prove that such discharge does not violate dose limits to a member of the public (see radioactive effluent emissions).|$|E
25|$|The {{half-life}} of the radioisotopes {{produced by}} fusion {{tends to be}} less than those from fission, so that the inventory decreases more rapidly. Unlike fission reactors, whose waste remains radioactive for thousands of years, most of the radioactive material in a fusion reactor would be the reactor core itself, which would be dangerous for about 50 years, and <b>low-level</b> <b>waste</b> for another 100. Although this waste will be considerably more radioactive during those 50 years than fission waste, the very short half-life makes the process very attractive, as the waste management is fairly straightforward. By 500 years the material would have the same radiotoxicity as coal ash.|$|E
