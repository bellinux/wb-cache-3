25|$|The first locks {{built on}} the Toulouse plain by Pierre-Paul Riquet were {{experimental}} and were not satisfactory. They consisted of rectangular lock with wooden stilts as foundations for the <b>side</b> <b>walls.</b> This form did not properly restrain the lateral material when the lock was empty. They then collapsed on themselves. He redefined {{the shape of his}} <b>locks</b> to rounded <b>side</b> <b>walls,</b> thicker, and more resistant to the lateral pressure of the earth. The dimensions of the locks were then large enough for the time. Because of these rounded forms, the architecture of the locks in the Canal du Midi is called Baroque style.|$|R

The first design for the locks on the canal was a {{rectangular}} shape however due to a collapse of a side-wall early in the building program (exactly which lock is not recorded), Riquet modified his plans and rebuilt both existing and new locks with an ovoid chamber. They were typically 11m wide at the midpoint and 6m at the gates with an overall length of 30.5m. Riquet also restricted the maximum rise to 2.9m so whereas previously he would have built one deep lock he instead used intermediate gates creating double, triple and sometimes quadruple chambers. During the Canal du Midi modernisation program of the 1970s several of these multiple chambers were converted into single [...] "deep" [...] <b>locks</b> with concrete <b>side</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} facade flame heights from an under-ventilated enclosure fire having an opening with <b>side</b> <b>walls.</b> A reduced-scale model, consisting of a cubic enclosure of 0. 4 m with a vertical facade <b>wall</b> and two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> was constructed for the experiments. The temperature profile inside the enclosure was measured by thermocouples whereas a CCD camera was employed to obtain the mean flame height of the ejected flames. It is found that the presence or the separation distance of the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> have {{no impact on the}} critical heat release rate of the enclosure (1500 A √H in kW). The effects of the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> on the mean flame height are pronounced for a relative larger flame than a small one having the same separation distance of the <b>side</b> <b>walls.</b> In addition as the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distance decreases, the effects become larger leading to flame heights much higher than those without sidewalls. A global dimensionless parameter K is proposed to account for the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effects, based characteristic length scales of the opening, and the distance between the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> D. The experimental data for different opening dimensions and <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distances are well correlated by this global parameter...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effects on facade flames ejected from the opening (such as a window) of an under-ventilated room fire. Experiments are carried out in a reduced-scale experimental setup, consisting of a cubic fire compartment having an opening with a vertical facade <b>wall</b> and two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> normal to the façade wall. By changing the distance of the two <b>side</b> <b>walls,</b> the facade flame heights for different opening conditions (width, height) are recorded by a CCD camera. It is found that as the distance of the two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> decreases the behavior the flame height can be distinguished into two regimes characterized by the dimensionless excess heat release rate, skew 5 dotQ_ex^ast See Formula in PDF, outside the opening: (a) for the “wall fire” (skew 5 dotQ_ex^ast See Formula in PDF ≤ 1. 3), the flame height is shown to change little with decrease of <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distance as the dominant entrainment is from the front direction (normal to the facade wall) independent of the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distances; (b) for the “axis-symmetrical fire” (5 dotQ_ex^ast > 1. 3), the flame height increases significantly with a decrease in <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distance as both the entrainment from the two side directions (parallel to the facade wall) and that from the front direction (normal to the facade wall) together apply. A global physically based non-dimensional factor K is then brought forward based on the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> constraint effect on the facade flame entrainment to characterize the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effect on the flame height, by accounting for the dimensionless excess heat release rate, the characteristic length scales of the opening as well as the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> separation distance.

In order to show {{the effects of}} the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> on the flow, two illustrative examples are given. One of them is the unsteady flow due to an applied pressure gradient in a duct of rectangular cross-section. The other is the unsteady flow in a duct of rectangular cross-section moving parallel to its length. These effects depend on the values of the aspect ratio. The variations of the velocity and the volume flux with respect to the aspect ratio show that these are appreciable effects of the walls on the flow.
