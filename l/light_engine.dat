5|$|On 16 January 1958, a {{passenger}} train {{collided with a}} <b>light</b> <b>engine</b> which was standing foul {{of the line and}} was derailed. The <b>light</b> <b>engine</b> ended up on its side. Thirteen people were injured. A signalman was blamed for the accident as he failed to ensure that the line was clear for the passenger train.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1919, a <b>light</b> <b>engine</b> {{ran into}} the rear of a {{passenger}} train due to an error by {{the driver of the}} <b>light</b> <b>engine.</b> About 20 people were injured.|$|E

5000|$|On 24 December 1910, {{an express}} {{passenger}} train {{was in a}} rear-end collision with two <b>light</b> <b>engines</b> near Moorcock Tunnel, {{to the south of}} Ais Gill summit, due to errors by the signalman at [...] and the firemen of the <b>light</b> <b>engines.</b> The train was derailed and caught fire. Twelve people were killed and seventeen were injured.|$|R
50|$|The Hawes Junction rail crash {{occurred}} at 5.49 am on 24 December 1910, {{just north of}} the Lunds viaduct between Hawes Junction and Aisgill on the Midland Railway's Settle and Carlisle main line in Westmorland (now Cumbria), England. It was caused when a busy signalman, Alfred Sutton, forgot about a pair of <b>light</b> <b>engines</b> waiting at his down (northbound) starting signal to return to their shed at Carlisle. They were still waiting there when the signalman set the road for the down Scotch express. When the signal cleared, the <b>light</b> <b>engines</b> set off in front of the express into the same block section. Since the <b>light</b> <b>engines</b> were travelling at low speed from a stand at Hawes Junction, and the following express was travelling at high speed, a collision was inevitable. The express caught the <b>light</b> <b>engines</b> just after Moorcock Tunnel near Aisgill summit in Mallerstang and was almost wholly derailed.|$|R
5|$|A minor {{accident}} occurred on 30 June 1957. A <b>light</b> <b>engine</b> travelling towards Tulse Hill {{was waiting to}} cross the south junction when it was struck from behind by an express passenger train from Victoria that had passed a signal at danger. The driver of the <b>light</b> <b>engine</b> and two passengers from the express were hospitalised but quickly discharged.|$|E
5|$|On 17 October 1885, a {{passenger}} train overran signals and {{collided with a}} <b>light</b> <b>engine.</b> One person was seriously injured, several sustained slight injuries.|$|E

5|$|On 15 September 1881, a <b>light</b> <b>engine</b> and a coal train {{collided}} {{near the}} mouth of Copenhagen Tunnel north of the station because of a signalman's error. One person was killed and another was severely injured. Bad weather contributed to flooding in the tunnels. One such incident in July 1901 suspended all traffic from the station for more than four hours, which happened at no other London terminus.|$|E

5000|$|Multi-cylinder boxer layouts {{have proved}} to be well suited as <b>light</b> {{aircraft}} <b>engines,</b> as exemplified by Continental, Lycoming, Rotax, Jabiru and Verner. [...] An important factor in aircraft use is the flat engine's absence of vibration, which allows a <b>lighter</b> <b>engine</b> mount.|$|R
5|$|There {{has been}} no serious {{accident}} in the immediate area around Victoria station. On 26 February 1884, an explosion occurred in the cloak-room of the Brighton side injuring seven staff, {{as part of the}} Fenian dynamite campaign. On 27 August 1910, an empty LB stock train derailed due to inadequate signalling arrangements, leading to four injuries. On 17 July 1946, a <b>light</b> <b>engine</b> collided with a passenger train; several people were injured. On 15 December 1959, a passenger train collided with a rake of parcels vans. At least eleven people were injured.|$|E
25|$|The Vought OS2U Kingfisher was an American catapult-launched {{observation}} floatplane. It was {{a compact}} mid-wing monoplane, {{with a large}} central float and small stabilizing floats. Performance was modest, because of its <b>light</b> <b>engine.</b> The OS2U could also operate on fixed, wheeled, taildragger landing gear.|$|E
25|$|The High Level Bridge was an {{important}} node on the railway network, and as branch line passenger services and mineral traffic built up it became a bottleneck. This was exacerbated by {{the location of the}} main locomotive depot for Newcastle being located at Gateshead; as many train services changed engines at Newcastle this generated a huge number of <b>light</b> <b>engine</b> movements to and from the depot across the bridge.|$|E

25|$|The next {{opportunity}} to see a Deltic back on the mainline and running under its own power was in April 1985 when D9000 was sent (at the request of ScotRail management) <b>light</b> <b>engine</b> from Haymarket Depot to Perth for an open day. Following newspaper comments by ScotRail's manager Chris Green around that time there was hope that D9000 might see regular work north of the border. Chris Green's move to the management team at the newly created Network SouthEast in 1986 put paid to that. However, that did not end his involvement with D9000. He arranged for Network South East depots to provide accommodation for both D9000 and D9016 and when {{he moved on to}} head up Virgin Rail Group D9000 was used on many Virgin CrossCountry service trains.|$|E
25|$|The {{very first}} Class 24 to be {{withdrawn}} was in November 1967 when a fire broke out on D5051 while it was working a train of empty coal wagons in Scotland. The damage was too severe {{for it to be}} repaired, and it was cut up at Inverurie in August 1968. It had lasted exactly 8 years. The second Class 24 {{to be withdrawn}} was also as the result of an accident in Scotland, this time at Castlecary. In this case D5122, running <b>light</b> <b>engine,</b> hit a stationary DMU at about , the impact and subsequent fire bending the main frames and completely destroying the No.2 end. The accident happened on 9 September 1968 but despite being withdrawn the same month, the locomotive was not finally cut up until March 1971. A total of 14 Class 24s were withdrawn and scrapped without receiving their TOPS number.|$|E
500|$|Also {{announced}} at the 2008 motor show was {{a version of the}} 6.0-litre V8 engine fitted with Active Fuel Management (AFM) technology, known as the L76. Originally omitted from the L98 V8, AFM aids fuel consumption under <b>light</b> <b>engine</b> loads, although it is available only when paired with the automatic transmission and power output is reduced by [...] The announcement of AFM coincided with the announcement of EcoLine, a badge highlighting Holden vehicles employing fuel saving technologies or those powered by fuels other than petrol. For the VE Commodore, both AFM and LPG-powered versions fall under the EcoLine umbrella. On 7 April 2009, Holden announced that dealerships were receiving their first deliveries of EcoLine-branded models, including the new L76 V8s.|$|E

50|$|The 1977 second series cars {{incorporated}} front suspension {{modifications to}} allow for the <b>lighter</b> <b>engine</b> along with a final drive ratio changed to 2.88:1. Other changes included improved ventilation, redesigned seats and service intervals extended to 10000 mi.|$|R
50|$|The two <b>light</b> <b>engines</b> {{were running}} at only an easy 25 mph. They had cleared Moorcock tunnel {{just over a}} mile north of Hawes Junction and were running across the Lunds viaduct 500 yd north of the tunnel when driver Bath glanced back and saw the express as it emerged from the tunnel. He opened his {{regulator}} and whistle. At the same time, driver Oldcorn on the leading engine of the express saw the red tail light on Bath's tender and applied the express's continuous brake. There was probably {{less than half a}} mile between the speeding express and the <b>light</b> <b>engines</b> so neither measure had time to take effect, and the express struck the <b>light</b> <b>engines</b> from behind. Bath's locomotive was derailed and lost its front bogie, but his and Scott's locomotives carried on for over 200 yd before Bath's locomotive came to rest against the side of a cutting. The two locomotives of the express were also derailed, and the coaches piled up behind them. The first two coaches were badly telescoped, and the twelve passengers who died were in these two coaches.|$|R
