The features of stress wave evolutions in the multilayers, including wave-front stress attenuation and strong interfacial discontinuities, are revealed by atomistic simulations.

The simulations provide insight into microplasticity behaviors including interactions between <b>lattice</b> and <b>misfit</b> dislocations.

The relationship between dislocation activity and dynamic stress wave evolution history is explored. The hybrid Lomer-Cottrell locks can dissociate under shock compression or reverse yielding. This dissociation facilitates slip transmission. The influence of coherent stress causes direction dependency in the slip transmission: a lattice dislocation is transmitted more smoothly across an interface from Ni to Cu than from Cu to Ni.
