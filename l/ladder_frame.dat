25|$|The curved-tube chassis was {{the more}} {{controversial}} of the two novel ideas. The existing Cooper 500 chassis design process {{had been one of}} evolution since the earliest production 500s rolled out of the Surbiton works in 1947, and had been based on simple, traditional twin longitudinal box-section <b>ladder</b> <b>frame.</b> With the introduction of the Mark V in 1950 this was augmented by a beefed-up and stiffened body support structure, creating a semi-space frame chassis. This was refined further over the next two years, with the Mark VI marking a switch to equally sized tubular upper and lower longerons, and the Mark VIIA introducing tubular upright sections as well. However, for 1953's Mark VIII the Coopers decided to start afresh with a completely new chassis design.|$|E
25|$|With the {{deterioration}} of the yellow Northerner stock, cars to replace these had to be found by sourcing {{from the rest of the}} NZR 56-foot carriage fleet. The change in service was marked, with a refurbished modular Mitsubishi FM van turned power-luggage van with handbrake end-mounted 11kW petrol generator, and three carriages, one from the Endeavour Express and later Southerner Express converted into a servery car seating 31 in reupholstered Addington Workshops-produced seats, in bays of four with two pairs of seats each facing into a table, arranged alcove-style, with windows over double the size of the old ones, enabling better views of the alpine scenery, reupholstered seats and carpet, and a buffet counter service, to replace refreshment stops at railway station cafeterias at Springfield and Otira. The original intention had been to replace each pair of windows with one larger window, but the final solution was to cut out the side of the cars and to insert a steel <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> to which sheets of strengthened glass were glued. The effect, of a continuous sheet of glass the length of the carriage, was spectacular and undoubtedly was a major factor in the success of the new service. The other two cars were red Picton - Greymouth cars that were refitted and repainted to the same standard but retained their smaller windows and seated 50, same seating arrangement and type as the servery car.|$|E
50|$|Prados have <b>ladder</b> <b>frames,</b> {{two-speed}} transfer {{boxes and}} rear beam axles. The J70 platform has a front beam axle while the J90, J120, and J150 platforms have front independent suspension.|$|R
50|$|All Fleetstars had <b>ladder</b> <b>frames</b> {{with the}} same three {{standard}} wheelbases, which increased slightly over the years. The exception was early model tandems, which shared their separate wheelbases. All models were available as semi-tractors, gasoline models had a Gross Combination Weight Rating (the loaded weight {{of the truck and}} any trailers) of 55,000 lb and diesel models had a 79,000 lb rating.|$|R
5000|$|Body-on-frame is an {{automobile}} construction {{method by which}} a separate body is mounted on a relatively rigid frame or chassis that carries the engine and drivetrain.

50|$|It {{is worth}} noting here a general feature of relativity: we have deduced, by {{considering}} {{the frame of the}} garage, that we do indeed trap the ladder inside the garage. This must therefore be true in any frame - it cannot be the case that the ladder snaps in one frame but not in another. From the <b>ladder's</b> <b>frame,</b> then, we know that there must be some explanation for how the ladder came to be trapped; we must simply find the explanation.|$|R

50|$|A {{truck frame}} {{consists}} of two parallel boxed (tubular) or Câ€‘shaped rails, or beams, held together by crossmembers. These frames {{are referred to as}} <b>ladder</b> <b>frames</b> due to their resemblance to a ladder if tipped on end. The rails consist of a tall vertical section (two if boxed) and two shorter horizontal flanges. The height of the vertical section provides opposition to vertical flex when weight is applied {{to the top of the}} frame (beam resistance). Though typically flat the whole length on heavy duty trucks, the rails may sometimes be tapered or arched for clearance around the engine or over the axles. The holes in rails are used either for mounting vehicle components and running wires and hoses, or measuring and adjusting the orientation of the rails at the factory or repair shop.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{move back}} to the mid-engine layout, the design of the 1950 Crown Supercoach would break many {{precedents}} in school bus construction. Although built on a steel frame, to fight corrosion, the body panels of the Supercoach were of aluminum. [...] In place of the traditional <b>ladder</b> truck-style <b>frame,</b> the Supercoach featured a monocque-style integrated frame.|$|R
50|$|The 1978 Fleetwood Brougham {{was built}} as body on frame construction. It used a <b>ladder</b> type <b>frame</b> with welded cross members.

5000|$|The Citation {{represented}} the highest trim level available within the Edsel brand. In addition to deluxe interior appointments, the Citation also received extra stainless steel details and a gold-anodized aluminum cove panel. The cove (or rear quarter-panel [...] "scallop") could be painted either {{the color of}} the body, {{the color of the}} roof, or a third color (tri-tone paint option). It used a <b>ladder</b> type <b>frame</b> with welded box side rails and independent ball-joint front suspension.|$|R
2500|$|BMW {{knew that}} it needed a four-seat family car {{to keep up with}} the rising wealth and {{expectations}} of the German people, but it could not access funding to develop a new car for this market. They therefore developed the 600, a four-seat car based on the Isetta. [...] The 600 used the front suspension, the front seats, and the front-mounted door from the Isetta, but used a new, longer <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> with a longer, four-seat body, a rear-mounted 0.6L flat-twin motorcycle engine, and a full-width rear track. [...] The 600's rear suspension was BMW's first use of the semi-trailing arm system that would be used on their sedans and coupes until the 1990s. [...] Released in 1957, the 600 could not compete against the larger, more powerful Volkswagen Beetle. [...] Production ended in 1959 after fewer than 35,000 were built.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced in 1938, the 2500 (2443cc) was {{the last}} 6C road car. World War II was coming and car {{development}} was stopped, but a few hundred 6C 2500s were built from 1940 to 1945. Postwar, the first new Alfa model was the 1946 6C 2500 Freccia d'Oro (Golden Arrow), of which 680 were built through 1951, with bodies by Alfa. The 2500 had enlarged engine compared to the predecessor model, this Vittorio Jano designed double overhead cam engine was available either one or three Weber carburetors. The triple carburetor version {{was used in the}} top of line SS (Super Sport) version. The 2443 cc engine was mounted to a steel <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> chassis, which was offered with three wheelbase lengths: [...] on the Turismo, [...] on the Sport and [...] on the Super Sport. Various coachbuilders made their own versions of the 2500, but most of the bodyworks was made by Touring of Milan.|$|E
2500|$|The OA vz. 27's armored {{body was}} {{mounted on a}} {{purpose-built}} <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> chassis. The chassis design was unusual {{as it could be}} driven in both directions as it had both forward and rear drivers. Both axles could be driven and steered, but not {{at the same time as}} the reverser lever controlled the direction of travel and which axle was being used so it was not a true four-wheel drive design[...] The forward driver sat on the right side using an observation port protected by an armored shutter with a vision slit. The assistant driver sat on the left and had his own vision port. The rear driver sat on the vehicle's left side. A heavy Schwarzlose MG vz. 07/24 water-cooled machine gun was mounted in the center of the rear hull with 72Â° of traverse. The crew accessed the fighting compartment from doors in both sides of the vehicle and a hatch in the turret. The gunner sat in a small, conical turret with 360Â° of traverse. It had an observation port in the front, vision slits on both sides and an armored searchlight on a swing arm in the rear. The turret had a Schwarzlose MG vz. 07/24 machine gun in a forward-facing ball mount and two other ball mounts were fitted on the sides of the turret. A ZB vz. 26 light machine gun was carried inside the vehicle. 5750 rounds were stored for the machine guns. The body had an internal frame of steel [...] "angle iron" [...] beams to which [...] armor plates were riveted.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced on October 15, 1959, the 1960 Edsel Ranger was now {{the only}} sedan Edsel offered, while the Edsel Villager name applied to two station wagons, a six- and a nine-passenger model. The {{decision}} was made to eliminate not only the Corsair, but the vertical grille element as well. The new grille had an [...] "hourglass" [...] appearance. By this point, the 1960 model shared so many body panels and interior trim features with the Ford, that the defining characteristics that distinguished the Edsel from the Ford were its taillights, grille, signal/parking lights and trim {{at the front of the}} sides of the fenders, and of course, name badges. It came with a <b>ladder</b> type <b>frame</b> and a 120" [...] wheelbase.|$|R
5000|$|With {{financial}} support from the brewery by whom he had been employed ten years earlier, van Doorne returned to self-employment in April 1928, establishing his own metal based manufacturing and repair business, concentrating on items such as cabinets, <b>ladders,</b> window <b>frames</b> and, increasingly, trailers {{which led to the}} business being renamed in 1932 as van Doorne's Aanhangwagenfabriek (DAF). [...] Although the business initially employed just four people, including Hub and his brother Wim, in just one year it expanded {{to the point where it}} employed 30 people. The business subsequently expanded into truck production and, during the Second World War, production of military vehicles. It was on account of the move into powered vehicles that the firmâ€™s name was changed again to Van Doorne's Automobielfabriek (DAF).|$|R
5000|$|The ZR2 {{package was}} only offered on the 2 door Blazer as the 2 door had the shorter wheelbase. It had a wider <b>ladder</b> type <b>frame</b> {{which made the}} track for the truck approx. 3.9 inches wider. It also lifted the Blazer about 3 inches which made it be able to clear 31x10.5 tires on 15 inch wheels. An {{enhanced}} front (7.25" [...] ring gear) and rear (8.5" [...] ring gear) axles w/ 3.73:1 rear-axle ratio. Larger wheel and axle bearings. A front anti-sway bar, skid plates, Bilstein shocks, and a beefier rear axle. This package was a little over $1000 and it was first introduced on the S10 pickup in 1994 and was carried over to the Blazer in 1996.|$|R
2500|$|According to Honda, [...] "Engineers {{started with}} Hondaâ€™s Global Light Truck {{platform}} and transformed 93% {{of the components}} into a mission-specific platform using approximately 44% high-strength steel across the unibody and seven high-strength steel cross members to create a fully boxed <b>ladder</b> <b>frame</b> that is fully integrated into the unibody. [...] Further differentiation included a unique suspension design with custom components, 100% unique sheetmetal and a 95% exclusive interior." [...] According to Autoweek, The Ridgeline's [...] "unibody has many braces, brackets, and reinforced areas that require more welding than traditional pickups." [...] The steel-reinforced fully boxed ladder-like unibody frame with its [...] "four-bone" [...] design and four-wheel independent suspension provided space for designers to build unique storage solutions in, around, {{and on top of}} the frame. Starting {{at the front of the}} Ridgeline, engineers crafted an aluminum hood that supports a unique cold air intake system for the engine that draws outside air from above and in front of the radiator to support torque production and deep water fording which Honda attempted to patent. [...] This hood design also allowed engineers to build environmentally protected windshield wipers that are also heated to improve winter performance. [...] Honda also incorporated large side-view mirrors to support better visibility while towing; due to their size, Honda incorporated small vortex generators on top of the mirrors to reduce air turbulence which Honda also attempted to patent. [...] In the crew-cab, the unibody frame allowed engineers to build a cabin with a flat load floor (i.e. no transmission hump) and more passenger space than other mid-size trucks. [...] At the center of the truck, the C-pillar's unique shape was specifically designed to help distribute large loads across the unibody frame and the cab so the truck could achieve its targeted payload and towing figures. [...] Also, the design of the C-pillar, rear roof garnish, and tailgate were built to maintain good aerodynamics and reduce turbulence between the cab and the tailgate while maintaining driver visibility. [...] This aerodynamic design allowed them to create a rear garnish that shields the rear glass window so when it's opened at speed there is no buffeting or rainwater intrusion. [...] The bed is built out of steel-reinforced Sheet Molding Composite (SMC) which is dent resistant, corrosion resistant, and is covered with a non-slip coating. [...] It is supported by high-strength steel crossmembers (three under the bed and two in the rear cab wall) to safely secure and support heavy loads, even under conditions that would cause the SMC to fail or during collisions that would try to force that load into the cab.|$|E

50|$|AC {{came back}} to the market after the Second World War with the staid 2-Litre range of cars in 1947, but it was with the Ace sports car of 1953 that the company really made its {{reputation}} in the post war years. Casting around for a replacement for the ageing 2-Litre, AC took up a design by John Tojeiro that used a light <b>ladder</b> type tubular <b>frame,</b> all independent transverse leaf spring suspension, and an open two seater alloy body made using English wheeling machines, possibly inspired by the Ferrari Barchetta of the day.|$|R
5000|$|Channeling is a {{modification}} {{that can be}} applied to cars with body-on-frame construction. To channel a car, its body is temporarily lifted off of its <b>ladder</b> or perimeter <b>frame.</b> After cutting the floor loose and refastening it higher inside the body, the body can then be lowered back over the frame. Thus the modification causes the entire body to rest closer to the ground without alterations to the suspension. The overall effect is to give the car's body a more massive appearance.Each automobile would have its own engineering challenges as far as modifying the various components of the chassis. Local laws may prevent making the modifications too extreme, and safety would dictate some restraint. Channeling is also popular amongst hot rod, leadsled and minitruck enthusiasts, though the latter refer to it as a [...] "body drop".|$|R
