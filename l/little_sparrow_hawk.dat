60|$|The {{giving away}} large alms {{had always been}} one of her great solaces--not that she was often {{permitted}} any personal contact with the poor: only to sit at a window watching them as they flocked into the court, to be relieved by her servants under supervision from some officer of her warders, so as to hinder any surreptitious communication from passing between them. Sometimes, however, the poor would accost her or her suite as she rode out; and she had a great compassion for them, deprived, as she said, of the alms of the religious houses, and flogged or branded if hunger forced them into beggary. On a fine spring day Sir Ralf Sadler invited the ladies out to a hawking party {{on the banks of the}} Dove, with the <b>little</b> <b>sparrow</b> <b>hawks,</b> whose prey was specially larks. Pity for the beautiful soaring songster, or for the young ones that might be starved in their nests, if the parent birds were killed, had not then been thought of. A gallop on the moors, though they were strangely dull, gray, and stony, was always the best remedy for the Queen's ailments; and the party got into the saddle gaily, and joyously followed the chase, thinking only of the dexterity and beauty of the flight of pursuer and pursued, instead of the deadly terror and cruel death to which they condemned the created creature, the very proverb for joyousness.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the poem}} the lover expresses erotic desire and the longing for {{fulfillment}} through his {{wish to be}} a <b>sparrow</b> <b>hawk</b> or, which was more prized, a goshawk {{so that he could}} fly to her. In the Middle Ages, the value of a <b>sparrow</b> <b>hawk</b> was proportional to its resemblance to the goshawk in size, strength and beauty.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of predator recognition in birds hasn't been understood well yet. There {{are two main}} hypotheses: recognition by components and particulate feature theory.

Our results suggested that birds assesss all scrambled dummies equally as a real unscrambled sparrowhawk. Therefore our results support rather the particulate feature theory...|$|R
