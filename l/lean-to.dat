5|$|A <b>lean-to</b> {{structure}} {{at the end}} of {{the north}} transept houses the heating system. There is a new western end to this building, constructed 2014, and the eastern end (which includes the entrance) can only be entered via the north door to the choir vestry.|$|E
5|$|The third door is a vestry door further right, {{leading to}} the small gabled north priests' vestry. It is of {{uncertain}} age and could be of nineteenth century origin. It now includes a modern brick chimney stack.). The priests' vestry in turn leads to the later nineteenth century choir sacristy or vestry. This is a slight <b>lean-to</b> structure, with timber glazing to the roof in two levels, and is built, none too elegantly, between {{the east end of}} the north transept and the original priests' vestry.|$|E
50|$|Adirondack <b>lean-tos</b> {{have been}} the unique {{exception}} to this clause. There are several hundred public <b>lean-tos</b> in the Adirondacks and along the Appalachian Trail. These refuges are generally {{open to the public}} on a first-come-first-served basis.|$|R

5|$|The Roger Mowry Tavern, {{also known}} {{variously}} as the Roger Mowry House, Olney House and Abbott House, was a historic stone ender house, built around 1653, in Providence, Rhode Island. Roger Mowry was a constable and operated the only tavern in the town. The tavern {{also served as}} a government meeting place, church, and jail. It was originally constructed as a -story single room house with a chamber upstairs. By 1711 the house was expanded with a two-story <b>lean-to</b> by 1711. At unknown later date, the top of the roof of the original house was raised up further. The original portion of the house was restored by Norman Isham by 1895. The Roger Mowry Tavern was the oldest house in Providence until it was demolished in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Sixty {{members and}} {{associates}} of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families {{set up for}} the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and Murphys another, and Reeds and Graveses the third. Keseberg built a <b>lean-to</b> for his family {{against the side of the}} Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, 6 of whom were toddlers or younger. Farther down the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: 6 men, 3 women, and 12 children in all. It began to snow again on the evening of November 4—the beginning of a storm that lasted 8 days.|$|E
5|$|The chapel was {{designed}} by Sir Charles Barry, shortly before he designed the Palace of Westminster. It was constructed between 1837 and 1839 out of sandstone, with a slate roof. It is in English neogothic style. The building has seven narrow bays, with buttresses and a lancet in each bay. The west end has a giant moulded archway, with an arched doorway at the ground floor with a window above. On the east end there is a rose window. The corners are square, with pinnacles. The inside of the chapel had galleries on three sides, and a ribbed, vaulted ceiling. The attached two-storey Sunday School {{is in the same}} style as the chapel, and has a triple-gabled north side, with large arched windows on the first floor. It also has a canted apse on the west end, and a <b>lean-to</b> porch. The building was listed on 3 October 1974, and is currently classed as Grade II*.|$|E
50|$|Structures {{other than}} those that {{facilitate}} recreational use, such as bridges and <b>lean-tos,</b> are generally not allowed, either.|$|R

5|$|The most {{prominent}} structure after the Holy Mother of God {{church is a}} rectangular chapel built against its western wall. The remaining section of the façade of the main church is situated immediately next to it with a ridge roof. Ivane Zakarian and his son Avak were buried inside in 1227. A small structure with a <b>lean-to</b> roof {{is attached to the}} north wall of the main church. It was used to store ceremonial items. On the north-western side of the monastery, a single nave and ridge-roofed church is located detached from the main church. Another building that hasn't survived used to be located next to it. Numerous dilapidated dwellings and auxiliary structures are scattered in the territory of the fortress such as a two-story building believed to be a residence for guards. There are traditional networks of tunnels, crypts, water reservoirs and wine cellars, found among most monasteries of medieval Armenia. Not far from the monastery one can find other medieval monuments such as the Holy Trinity monastery, Saint George church, a 13th-century spring monument, a 19th-century Russian chapel, a Greek church as well as various khachkars and chapels.|$|E
5|$|Based on a {{courtyard}} house layout, externally the harled whinstone rubble mansion {{is a combination}} of Elizabethan and Jacobean (or Gothic) design, similar to Smith's work at Slains. A spacious central courtyard is surrounded by buildings three storeys high. Within the back of the courtyard, circular towers enclose the service stairways. A large Elizabethan-style tower housing the main stairway is also set within the courtyard but sited to the front behind the reception rooms. Other external features include: canted and box bays; a variety of lofty towers that are round, square or octagonal; many different gables; and numerous diagonally set stone flues. The southeast facing front elevation lacks symmetry with the main Tudor style entranceway set off centre and extending out. A plaque commemorating the building dates of 1839–1842 and a central armorial are above the round arched entrance. There is also an eight-sided tower positioned at the front corner. A separate driveway accesses the outside kitchen yard {{at the back of the}} north west elevation. This side of the mansion is plainer, more restrained and built into the slope of the hillside. A lengthy one storey <b>lean-to</b> houses fuel supplies and servants toilets and provides additional ground support. The northeast elevation is also more architecturally reserved than the front.|$|E
5|$|Upon Mowry's death, {{his wife}} {{retained}} the house until {{selling it to}} Stephen Paine on September 5, 1671. Paine conveyed it to Samuel Whipple who resided in the house {{until his death in}} 1711. Upon his death the house was recorded as having a two-story <b>lean-to.</b> Whipple transferred the property to his wife and upon her death, which passed to their daughters Abigail and Hope Whipple. Hope Whipple would marry Robert Currie and upon her death, Robert Currie would marry her sister Abigail Whipple, and upon her death fell to Robert Currie's ownership. In 1737, Currie sold the house to William Smith, Job Whipple and John Whipple. It remained in the Whipple family until 1761 when it was sold to Captain Joseph Owen. The house would take its final name, the Abbott House, from Thomas Abbott who married Joseph Owen's daughter and resided in the house until his death in 1826. The Mowry Tavern was allegedly one of only five buildings not burned by the Indians during King Philip's War. It is believed that it was spared because Roger Williams, a friend of the Indians, held Christian worship services in the building. The house was located on Abbott Street adjacent to the North Burial Ground. The entire structure was demolished in 1900 to construct a triple decker tenement house. At the time of its demolition, it was the oldest house in Providence.|$|E

25|$|In 1976 {{the state}} {{purchased}} some more land {{along the trail}} and built another <b>lean-to</b> at , along the trail below the summit. The next year the tower's two support structures, the observer's cabin and a storage shed, were removed. These were the last significant changes to facilities on Tremper for two decades.|$|E
25|$|Two small <b>lean-to</b> {{wood and}} zinc {{structures}} were {{added a few}} years ago. The auditorium was adapted to air conditioning features, with acoustic ceiling and related fixtures having been added. In spite of it all, and probably, because of the school's imposing scale, well balanced proportions and well-kept classical detailing, the integrity {{has not yet been}} lost.|$|E
5000|$|The area {{contains}} 168 {{bodies of}} water covering 2400 acre, 78.3 mi of foot trails, and 11 <b>lean-tos.</b> The [...] Northville-Placid Trail traverses it.|$|R

25|$|A <b>lean-to</b> fire-build {{starts with}} the same pile of tinder as the tipi fire-build. Then, a long, thick piece of {{kindling}} is driven into the ground at an angle, so that it overhangs the tinder pile. The smaller pieces of kindling are leaned against the big stick so that the tinder is enclosed between them.|$|E
25|$|In 1921 {{the state}} bought {{more of the}} mountain, {{allowing}} it to designate the road as a hiking trail. By 1931 it had been extended beyond the tower as a footpath, descending the northeast {{side of the mountain}} into Hoyt Hollow to Willow. Later in the 1930s a <b>lean-to</b> was built at the summit for backpackers to camp in.|$|E
25|$|The {{facilities}} {{which have}} remained {{since the war}} and were still used {{at the end of}} the air station's operation were the hangars, the officer's mess hall and Mark. Three of the six main hangars have survived. These were standard German types. The one consisted of a <b>lean-to</b> roof supported by a truss. The other two had a semicircular arch roof. Both were built with wooden walls and roofs.|$|E
50|$|A central {{pavilion}} projects {{from the}} north. On the east a shed roof shelters the former platform both {{north and south}} of the building. Two small <b>lean-tos</b> are on the north and west.|$|R
5000|$|... 5 cabins. Each cabin has its {{own unique}} charm ranging from <b>lean-to's</b> around it (at Adirondack), newly renovated {{bathroom}} (in Penataquit), or wood burning stoves for heat (in Shinnecock, Boat House, and Tuocs).|$|R
5000|$|Construction of the three-story wood-frame First Period {{house was}} begun by Captain John Whipple in 1677 {{at the corner}} of Saltonstall and Market Streets. This initial {{construction}} consisted of a half-house timber frame with a chimney on the right side. [...] In 1690, his son Major John Whipple added a second half-house {{to the right of the}} entryway. By 1705, a series of 3-sided 1-story timber frame additions (<b>lean-tos)</b> had been added on the west side of the house, including a kitchen (the third chimney), a buttery, and sleeping quarters for the household slaves and servants. Circa 1710, the west roof of the primary house was raised and extended over the <b>lean-tos</b> creating 4 additional slope-ceiling rooms. The total room count was then 14, not including the fully usable 3rd-floor attic above the primary structure. This was a very large house then (and now), with high ceilings in all rooms except the <b>lean-tos,</b> a prominent location near the mills and with land abutting the Ipswich River. It became known as “The Mansion”, a title it retained for more than a century.|$|R
