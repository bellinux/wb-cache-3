25|$|Solon's {{laws were}} inscribed on large wooden slabs or {{cylinders}} {{attached to a}} series of axles that stood upright in the Prytaneion. These axones appear to have operated on the same principle as a <b>Lazy</b> <b>Susan,</b> allowing both convenient storage and ease of access. Originally the axones recorded laws enacted by Draco in the late 7th Century (traditionally 621 BC). Nothing of Draco's codification has survived except for a law relating to homicide, yet there is consensus among scholars that it did not amount to anything like a constitution. Solon repealed all Draco's laws except those relating to homicide. During his visit to Athens, Pausanias, the 2nd century AD geographer reported that the inscribed laws of Solon were still displayed by the Prytaneion. Fragments of the axones were still visible in Plutarch's time but today the only records we have of Solon's laws are fragmentary quotes and comments in literary sources such as those written by Plutarch himself. Moreover, the language of his laws was archaic even {{by the standards of the}} fifth century and this caused interpretation problems for ancient commentators. Modern scholars doubt the reliability of these sources and our knowledge of Solon's legislation is therefore actually very limited in its details.|$|E
500|$|Designing Contacts {{visual effects}} {{sequences}} was {{a joint effort}} among eight separate VFX companies. This team included Sony Pictures Imageworks, Peter Jackson's Weta Digital, George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic, and Effects Associates, with Pixar's RenderMan used for CGI rendering. Weta Digital, in particular, was responsible for designing the wormhole sequence. Jodie Foster admitted she had difficulty with blue screen technology {{because it was a}} first for the actress. [...] "It was a blue room. Blue walls, blue roof. It was just blue, blue, blue," [...] Foster explained.

2500|$|Estimating the target's {{course was}} {{generally}} {{considered the most}} difficult of the observation tasks. The accuracy of the result was highly dependent on the experience of the skipper. During combat, the actual course of the target was not usually determined but instead the skippers determined a related quantity called [...] "angle on the bow." [...] Angle on the bow is the angle formed by the target course and the line of sight to the submarine. Some skippers, like the legendary Richard O'Kane, practiced determining the angle on the bow by looking at IJN ship models mounted on a calibrated <b>lazy</b> <b>Susan</b> through an inverted binocular barrel.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{film that}} Foster {{directed}} was Home for the Holidays, released in 1995. It starred Holly Hunter and Robert Downey Jr. and {{was described as}} a black comedy [...] "set around a nightmarish Thanksgiving". Released in November 1995, it was a critical and commercial failure. The following year, Foster received two honorary awards: the Crystal Award, awarded annually for women in the entertainment industry, and the Berlinale Camera at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival. After Nell in 1994, Foster did not act in any new projects until 1997, aside from voicing characters in episodes of Frasier in 1996 and The X-Files in early 1997. She was in talks to star in David Fincher's thriller The Game, but its production company, Polygram, dropped her from the project after disagreements over her role. Foster sued the company, saying that she had an oral agreement with them to star in the film and had as a result taken [...] "herself off the market" [...] and lost out on other film projects. The case was later settled out of court. Foster finally made her return to the big screen in Contact (1997), a science fiction film based on a novel by Carl Sagan and directed by Robert Zemeckis. She starred as a scientist searching for extraterrestrial life in the SETI project. Due to the special effects, many of the scenes were filmed with a bluescreen; this was Foster's first experience with the technology. She commented, [...] "Blue walls, blue roof. It was just blue, blue, blue. And I was rotated on a <b>lazy</b> <b>Susan</b> with the camera moving on a computerized arm. It was really tough." [...] The film was a commercial success and earned Foster a Saturn Award and a nomination for a Golden Globe. She also had an asteroid, 17744 Jodiefoster, named in her honor in 1998.|$|E

Between 1955 and 1958, Lowen designed the SC55 and SC58, the Aluminium Shell Chair, mahogany fold-out extension table and cane back chairs. The Narvik dining and lounge ranges were released in 1961, the Fleronde (1964/65), dining setting (1966/67), desk and chair for the Australian Exhibition at Expo 67 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and Flerena in 1968.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{seems to}} have been popularized in the United States in the 1840s, after the model of earlier [...] "dumbwaiters" [...] now known as serving trays and <b>lazy</b> <b>Susans.</b> The {{mechanical}} dumbwaiter was invented by George W. Cannon, a New York City inventor. Cannon first filed for the patent of a brake system (US Patent no. 260776) {{that could be used for}} a dumbwaiter on January 6, 1883. Cannon later filed for the patent on the mechanical dumbwaiter (US Patent No. 361268) on February 17, 1887. Cannon reportedly generated a vast amount of royalties from the dumbwaiter patents until his death in 1897.|$|R

The L&N line was removed in the mid 1980s. The tracks for the Murphy Branch remain but are inoperable. It has been idle since the mid 1990s when the Great Smoky Mountain Railroad discontinued service between Murphy and Andrews. The L&N Depot remains as a community center just southwest of downtown Murphy.

40|$|Introduction The {{fact that}} many common work {{practices}} involve collaboration is driving the need for interfaces that enable sharing of digital information among groups of people. Since traditional tables naturally support group work, digital tabletop displays offer a great potential for the design and development of collaborative interfaces that provide access to digital information and media in a natural and intuitive way [Scott et al. 2003]. In addition to facilitating information sharing, interfaces for large displays should also support the creative flow that emerges during group meetings. However, problems relating to reaching items {{at the far side}} of the display, supporting mobility of people, and sharing and passing of digital information still need to be addressed. Devices such as <b>lazy</b> <b>susans,</b> conveyer belts and sushi canals have been developed to mitigate these problems in the physical world. For digital displays, the idea of dedicating a fixed narrow path at the perimete...|$|R

5000|$|Kitchens today. Modern kitchen {{design has}} {{improved}} {{partly as a}} result of ergonomic research. Functionality is important; one research study had [...] "anthropological scientists" [...] observing homeowners [...] "interact" [...] with their kitchen cabinets. Kitchens are larger and have more cabinets; some kitchens may have as many as fifty drawers and cabinet doors. New features today include deep drawers for cookware, pull-out shelves to avoid excess bending, sponge trays on the front of sink cabinets, pullout hideaway garbage/recycling containers, pull-out spice cabinets, <b>lazy</b> <b>susans</b> in corner cabinets, vertical storage for cookie sheets, full-extension drawer slides, and drawers and doors with so-called soft-close/positive-close mechanisms enabling drawers to shut quietly, or which shut fully after being pushed only partially. As housing stocks get older, many homeowners face problems with visually unappealing older kitchen cabinets; in such situations, there is a choice to buy new (most expensive), reface existing (less expensive), or to strip and refinish existing (least expensive if done by the homeowner) cabinets. By 2009, there was more emphasis on cabinets designed with environmental factors in mind. So-called [...] "green cabinets" [...] were becoming more popular. As homes in Western countries became more airtight to save on heating and cooling costs, air quality has sometimes suffered as gases which are released from resins as they cure. Resins, organic materials which convert from liquid to solid form, are used to manufacture engineered wood (e.g., particleboard) frequently used to build kitchen cabinet carcases can be a factor.

50|$|During the 1960s, when {{experimental}} theatre was generating enormous interest, Leonard Melfi {{was considered}} one of the most important artists working in the American theatre. Melfi's best-known work for the stage, Birdbath, was first produced in 1965 at La MaMa ETC in New York City, under the direction of Tom O'Horgan. When La MaMa's Ellen Stewart first collaborated with actor/producer Leslie Irons to found Corner Theatre ETC in Baltimore, that theatre's inaugural production was Melfi's Birdbath. Melfi's first produced play, <b>Lazy</b> Baby <b>Susan,</b> was likewise staged at La MaMa during its inaugural season, in 1962. Melfi was also a contributor, along with John Lennon and playwright Sam Shepard, to the notorious 1969 Broadway musical Oh, Calcutta! In all, Leonard Melfi wrote over 70 plays of various length during the course of his lifetime.|$|R

50|$|Four glasses or {{tumblers}} {{are placed}} on the corners of a square <b>Lazy</b> <b>Susan.</b> Some of the glasses are upright (up) and some upside-down (down). A blindfolded person is seated next to the <b>Lazy</b> <b>Susan</b> and is required to re-arrange the glasses {{so that they are}} all up or all down, either arrangement being acceptable, which will be signalled by the ringing of a bell. The glasses may be re-arranged in turns subject to the following rules. Any two glasses may be inspected in one turn and after feeling their orientation the person may reverse the orientation of either, neither or both glasses. After each turn the <b>Lazy</b> <b>Susan</b> is rotated through a random angle. The puzzle is to devise an algorithm which allows the blindfolded person to ensure that all glasses have the same orientation (either up or down) in a finite number of turns. The algorithm must be non-stochastic i.e. it must not depend on luck.|$|E
