40|$|ABSTRACTSignaling <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>activation</b> {{molecule}} (SLAM; CDw 150) is a 70 kDa glycoprotein. Signaling <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>activation</b> molecule is constitutively expressed {{on memory}} T cells, CD 56 + T cells, {{a subset of}} T cell receptor γδ+ cells, immature thymocytes and, at low levels, on a proportion of peripheral blood B cells. Signaling <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>activation</b> molecule is rapidly upregulated on all T and B cells after activation. Engagement of SLAM by F(ab’) 2 fragments of an anti-SLAM monoclonal antibody (mAb A 12) enhances antigen-specific T cell proliferation. In addition, mAb A 12 was directly mitogenic for T cell clones and activated T cells. T cell proliferation induced by mAb A 12 is independent of interleukin (IL) - 2, IL- 4, IL- 12 and IL- 15, but is cyclosporin A sensitive. Ligation of SLAM during antigen-specific T cell proliferation resulted in upregulation of interferon (IFN) -γ production, even by allergen-specific T helper cell (Th) 2 clones, whereas the levels of IL- 4 and IL- 5 production were only marginally affected. The mAb A 12 was unable to induce IL- 4 and IL- 5 production by Th 1 clones. Co-stimulation of skin-derived Der P 1 -specific Th 2 cells from patients with atopic dermatitis via SLAM resulted in the generation of a population of IFN-γ-producing cells, thereby reverting their phenotype to a Th 0 pattern. Signaling <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>activation</b> molecule is a high-affinity self ligand mediating homophilic cell interaction. In addition, soluble SLAM enhances both T and B cell proliferation. Collectively, these data indicate that SLAM molecules act both as receptors and ligands that are not only involved in T cell expansion but also drive the expanding T cells during immune responses into the Th 0 /Th 1 pathway. This suggests that signaling through SLAM {{plays a role in}} directing Th 0 /Th 1 development...|$|R

40|$|T {{cells from}} {{patients}} with {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) display a number of abnormalities, including increased early signaling events following engagement of the TCR. Signaling <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>activation</b> molecule family cell surface receptors and the X-chromosome-defined signaling <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>activation</b> molecule-associated protein (SAP) adaptor are important {{in the development of}} several immunocyte lineages and modulating the immune response. We present evidence that SAP protein levels are decreased in T cells and in their main subsets isolated from 32 women and three men with SLE, independent of disease activity. In SLE T cells, SAP protein is also subject to increased degradation by caspase- 3. Forced expression of SAP in SLE T cells normalized IL- 2 production, calcium (Ca(2 +)) responses, and tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins. Exposure of normal T cells to SLE serum IgG, known to contain anti-CD 3 /TCR Abs, resulted in SAP downregulation. We conclude that SLE T cells display reduced levels of the adaptor protein SAP, probably as a result of continuous T cell activation and degradation by caspase- 3. Restoration of SAP levels in SLE T cells corrects the overexcitable lupus T cell phenotype...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} basis of X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) disease has {{been attributed to}} mutations in the signaling <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>activation</b> molecule-associated protein (SAP), an src homology 2 domain-containing intracellular signaling molecule known to interact with the lymphocyte-activating surface receptors signaling <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>activation</b> molecule and 2 B 4. To investigate the effect of SAP defects on TCR signal transduction, herpesvirus saimiri-immortalized CD 4 Th cells from XLP patients and normal healthy individuals were examined for their response to TCR stimulation. CD 4 T cells of XLP patients displayed elevated levels of tyrosine phosphorylation compared with CD 4 T cells from healthy individuals. In addition, downstream serine/threonine kinases are constitutively active in CD 4 T cells of XLP patients. In contrast, TCR-mediated activation of Akt, c-Jun-NH(2) -terminal kinases, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases in XLP CD 4 T cells was transient and rapidly diminished when compared with that in control CD 4 T cells. Consequently, XLP CD 4 T cells exhibited severe defects in up-regulation of IL- 2 and IFN-gamma cytokine production upon TCR stimulation and in MLRs. Finally, SAP specifically interacted with a 75 -kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein upon TCR stimulation. These results demonstrate that CD 4 T cells from XLP patients exhibit aberrant TCR signal transduction and that the defect in SAP function is likely responsible for this phenotype...|$|R

The Edmonston strain of MV, which can use either CD 46 or SLAM as a receptor, produced comparable titers on these two types of cells.

40|$|The {{signaling}} <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>activation</b> molecule (SLAM) {{family of}} receptors and the SLAM-associated protein (SAP) family of intracellular adaptors {{are expressed in}} immune cells.

Moreover, the prototype of the SAP family, that is SAP, is mutated in a human immunodeficiency, X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) disease. In the presence of SAP-family adaptors, the SLAM family usually mediates stimulatory signals that promote immune cell activation or differentiation. In the absence of SAP-family adaptors, though, the SLAM family undergoes a “switch-of-function,” thereby mediating inhibitory signals that suppress immune cell functions.

SLAM-deficient mice did not manifest allergen-induced bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophilia, increased serum IgE, or heightened airway responses compared with wild-type mice.

40|$|The {{signaling}} <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>activation</b> molecule (SLAM), {{present on}} the surface of hematopoietic cells, can regulate some events of the immune responses.

SLAM is constitutively expressed in most of these cells, is rapidly induced after antigenic or inflammatory stimuli, and participates in the immunological synapse. Defects in the function of the SLAM-SAP pathway contribute to immunological abnormalities, resulting in autoimmune diseases, tumors of the lymphoid tissues and inadequate responses to infectious agents. Initially, the role of SLAM was investigated using an anti-SLAM monoclonal antibody (&# 945;-SLAM mAb) identified as an agonist of the SLAM-SAP pathway, which could induce the production of interferon-&# 947; and could redirect the immune response to a T helper 1 (Th 1) cell profile.

40|$|SummaryThe {{signaling}} <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>activation</b> molecule (SLAM) family includes homophilic and heterophilic receptors {{that regulate}} both innate and adaptive immunity. The ectodomains of most SLAM {{family members are}} composed of an N-terminal IgV domain and a C-terminal IgC 2 domain. NK-T-B-antigen (NTB-A) is a homophilic receptor that stimulates cytotoxicity in natural killer (NK) cells, regulates bactericidal activities in neutrophils, and potentiates T helper 2 (Th 2) responses. The 3. 0 Å crystal structure of the complete NTB-A ectodomain revealed a rod-like monomer that self-associates to form a highly kinked dimer spanning an end-to-end distance of ∼ 100 Å. The NTB-A homophilic and CD 2 -CD 58 heterophilic dimers show overall structural similarities but differ in detailed organization and physicochemical properties of their respective interfaces. The NTB-A structure suggests a mechanism responsible for binding specificity within the SLAM family and imposes physical constraints relevant to the colocalization of SLAM-family proteins with other signaling molecules in the immunological synapse...|$|R
40|$|Signaling <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>activation</b> {{molecule}} (SLAM) family receptors mediate important regulatory {{signals in}} immune cells, {{as a result}} of their exquisite ability to associate with members of the SLAM-associated protein (SAP) family of adaptors. As discussed herein, recent findings show that the SLAM and SAP families carry out pivotal functions in innate-like and conventional lymphocytes. They are critically needed for the development of innate-like lymphocytes such as NKT cells. In addition, they influence several of the functions of conventional lymphocytes, including the ability of CD 4 + T cells to secrete certain cytokines and mediate B cell help; CD 8 + T cell proliferation and cytokine production; NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity; and B cell antibody production. These unique functional properties appear to be facilitated by the ability of SLAM-related receptors to serve as self-ligands during homotypic interactions between immune cells.

40|$|X-linked {{lymphoproliferative}} disease (XLP- 1) is an often-fatal primary immunodeficiency {{associated with the}} exuberant expansion of activated CD 8 + T cells after Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. XLP- 1 is caused by defects in signaling <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>activation</b> molecule (SLAM) -associated protein (SAP), an adaptor protein that modulates T cell receptor (TCR) -induced signaling. SAP-deficient T cells exhibit impaired TCR restimulation-induced cell death (RICD) and diminished TCR-induced inhibition of diacylglycerol kinase α (DGKα), leading to increased diacylglycerol metabolism and decreased signaling through Ras and PKCθ (protein kinase Cθ). We show that down-regulation of DGKα activity in SAP-deficient T cells restores diacylglycerol signaling at the immune synapse and rescues RICD via induction of the proapoptotic proteins NUR 77 and NOR 1. Pharmacological inhibition of DGKα prevents the excessive CD 8 + T cell expansion and interferon-γ production that occur in SAP-deficient mice after lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection without impairing lytic activity.

40|$|X-linked {{lymphoproliferative}} disease (XLP) {{is characterized by}} abnormal im-mune responses to Epstein-Barr virus attributed to inactivating mutations of the SAP gene. Previous studies showed im-munoglobulin E (IgE) deficiency and low serum IgG levels in Sap-deficient mice before and after viral infections, which are associated with impaired CD 4 T-helper function. In the present work, we find that signaling <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>activation</b> molecule (SLAM) –associated protein (SAP) is expressed in B cells and this expression is down-regulated after stimu-lation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin 4 (IL- 4). We demonstrate that B cells from Sap-deficient mice exhibit reduced IgG and IgA production in vitro. This impairment correlates with de-creased circular transcript levels of I, I 2 a, I 2 b, and I 3 after stimulation, which indicate a defective Ig switch recombina-tion in Sap-deficient B cells. While XLP is believed to cause defects in T, natural killer T (NKT), and natural killer (NK) cells, our results indicate that B cells are also affected.
