40|$|The brain {{activity}} of a newborn affects postnatal adaptation, the disorder {{of which can}} cause dysfunction of organs and systems of the immature organism {{and the development of}} diseases in more distant periods of maturation. Objective: Our aim was to study the effect of <b>levocarnitine</b> on dynamics of the brain bioelectrical activity formation in term infants delivered by cesarean section. Methods. The study included term infants (gestation period 38 – 40 weeks) delivered by cesarean section, with perinatal hypoxic lesion of the central nervous system (cerebral ischemia). Children were randomized into groups of standard (recommended) treatment and standard treatment enhanced with <b>levocarnitine</b> (plus <b>levocarnitine)</b> — 30 % oral solution at a dose of 100 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks starting from the 7 th day of life. The brain bioelectrical activity was assessed with electroencephalography (EEG) of the natural sleep period on the 3 rd– 6 th day and then at 3, 6, and 12 months. Results. 45 children were randomized into groups of standard treatment and standard treatment plus <b>levocarnitine,</b> of which 44 and 40 children completed the study, respectively. Initially, the delayed formation of age-related {{brain activity}} was detected in 16 / 40 (40 %) children receiving <b>levocarnitine</b> and in 19 / 44 (43 %) in the experimental group (p = 0. 767), disturbances in the EEG sleep pattern with generation of background anomalies — in 17 (43 %) and 16 (36 %) (p = 0. 565), pathological graph elements — in 1 (3 %) and 2 (5 %) children (p = 0. 536), respectively. According to the dynamic EEG control results, it was found that after 1 year the cerebral dysfunction was registered less frequently in children receiving <b>levocarnitine</b> — in 32 (80 %) vs. 42 (96 %) children in the group of standard treatment (p = 0. 028). Conclusion. Adminisration of <b>levocarnitine</b> in the neonatal period reduces the risk of developing cerebral dysfunction {{by the end of the}} first year of life.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of {{adjuvant}} <b>levocarnitine</b> therapy on EPO resistance, oxidative stress response and inflammatory response in patients with hemodialysis. Methods: A total of 78 patients who received maintenance hemodialysis in Beijing Chaoyang District Shuangqiao Hospital between May 2015 and October 2016 were selected and randomly divided into two groups, the <b>levocarnitine</b> group received <b>levocarnitine</b> combined with conventional anemia correction therapy, and the control group accepted routine anemia correction therapy. The extent of EPO resistance, oxidative stress response and inflammatory response in two groups of patients were assessed before treatment as well as 3 months and 6 months after treatment. Results: 3 months and 6 months after treatment, the rhuEPO dosage and ERI, Nrf- 2, ARE, HO- 1 and NQO- 1 expression in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} as well as AOPP, 8 -OHdG, MDA, MCP- 1, sICAM- 1, PTX 3, IL- 4 and IL- 10 levels in serum of <b>levocarnitine</b> group had been gradually decreasing while the rhuEPO dosage and ERI, Nrf- 2, ARE, HO- 1 and NQO- 1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as AOPP, 8 -OHdG, MDA, MCP- 1, sICAM- 1, PTX 3, IL- 4 and IL- 10 levels in serum of control group were without significant change.

40|$|Several {{experimental}} {{studies have shown}} that <b>levocarnitine</b> reduces myocardial injury after ischemia and reperfusion by counteracting the toxic effect of high levels of free fatty acids, which occur in ischemia, and by improving carbohydrate metabolism. In addition to increasing the rate of fatty acid transport into mitochondria, <b>levocarnitine</b> reduces the intramitochondrial ratio of acetyl-CoA to free CoA, thus stimulating the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and increasing the oxidation of pyruvate. Supplementation of the myocardium with <b>levocarnitine</b> results in an increased tissue carnitine content, a prevention of the loss of high-energy phosphate stores, ischemic injury, and improved heart recovery on reperfusion. Clinically, <b>levocarnitine</b> has been shown to have anti-ischemic properties. In small short-term studies, <b>levocarnitine</b> acts as an antianginal agent that reduces ST segment depression and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. These short-term studies also show that <b>levocarnitine</b> releases the lactate of coronary artery disease patients subjected to either exercise testing or atrial pacing. These cardioprotective effects have been confirmed during aortocoronary bypass grafting and acute myocardial infarction. In a randomized multicenter trial performed on 472 patients, <b>levocarnitine</b> treatment (9 g/day by intravenous infusion for 5 initial days and 6 g/day orally for the next 12 months), when initiated early after acute myocardial infarction, attenuated left ventricular dilatation and prevented ventricular remodeling. In treated patients, there was a trend towards a reduction in the combined incidence of death and CHF after discharge. <b>Levocarnitine</b> could improve ischemia and reperfusion by (1) preventing the accumulation of long-chain acyl-CoA, which facilitates the production of free radicals by damaged mitochondria; (2) improving repair mechanisms for oxidative-induced damage to membrane phospholipids; (3) inhibiting malignancy arrhythmias because of accumulation within the myocardium of long-chain acyl-CoA; and (4) reducing the ischemia-induced apoptosis and the consequent remodeling of the left ventricle. Propionyl-L-carnitine is a carnitine derivative that has a high affinity for muscular carnitine transferase, and it increases cellular carnitine content, thereby allowing free fatty acid transport into the mitochondria. Moreover, propionyl-L-carnitine stimulates a better efficiency of the Krebs cycle during hypoxia by providing it with a very easily usable substrate, propionate, which is rapidly transformed into succinate without energy consumption (anaplerotic pathway). Alone, propionate cannot be administered to patients in view of its toxicity. The results of phase- 2 studies in chronic heart failure patients showed that long-term oral treatment with propionyl-L-carnitine improves maximum exercise duration and maximum oxygen consumption over placebo and indicated a specific propionyl-L-carnitine effect on peripheral muscle metabolism. A multicenter trial on 537 patients showed that propionyl-L-carnitine improves exercise capacity in patients with heart failure, but preserved cardiac functio...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of <b>levocarnitine</b> + {{coenzyme}} Q 10 adjuvant therapy on vasoactive molecules, endothelial injury and oxidative stress in patients with chronic heart failure. Methods: A total of 90 patients with chronic heart failure who were treated in the hospital between December 2014 and December 2016 were collected and divided into control group and observation group by random number table method, 45 cases in each group. Control group received conventional therapy, and observation group received <b>levocarnitine</b> + coenzyme Q 10 adjuvant therapy {{on the basis of}} conventional therapy. The differences in vasoactive molecule, endothelial injury and oxidative stress levels were compared between the two groups before and after treatment. Results: Before treatment, the differences in vasoactive molecule, endothelial injury and oxidative stress levels were not statistically significant between the two groups of patients. After treatment, serum vasoactive molecules ET- 1, AngⅡ and TXB 2 contents of observation group were lower than those of control group while NO content was higher than that of control group; endothelial function indexes FMD level was higher than that of control group; serum oxidative stress indexes SOD and T-AOC contents were higher than those of control group while MDA and ROS contents were lower than those of control group.

40|$|<b>Levocarnitine</b> acetyl has {{previously}} been found to significantly prevent axotomy-induced cell death in the spinal cord motor nucleus 9 and 12 months after section of the sciatic nerve in rats. In the present paper, the effects of <b>levocarnitine</b> acetyl on axotomy-induced cell death in the brain stem motor nuclei 90 days after section of the vagus nerve were studied. The right vagus nerve was cut at the neck. To prevent regeneration, a 5 mm-long segment of the vagus nerve was excised and the distal stump was displaced caudally. After surgery, a group of rats (n = 6) was treated with <b>levocarnitine</b> acetyl dissolved in the drinking water (75 mg/kg/day) (Group I). A second group of operated rats (n = 4) received drinking water alone. (Group II). Ninety days postoperatively, in the rats of both groups the proximal nerve stump of the vagus nerve was injected with horseradish peroxidase to label retrogradely the brain stem motoneurons of the dorsal motor vagal and the ambiguus nuclei. The brain stem nuclei were also labelled by horseradish peroxidase in three unoperated control rats (Group III).

We investigated whether restoration of the carnitine pool might improve chemotherapy-induced fatigue in non-anaemic cancer patients. Consecutive patients with low plasma carnitine levels who experienced fatigue during chemotherapy were considered eligible for study entry. Patients were excluded if they had anaemia or other conditions thought to be causing asthenia. Fatigue was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue quality of life questionnaire. Treatment consisted of oral <b>levocarnitine</b> 4 g daily, for 7 days. Fifty patients were enrolled; chemotherapy was cisplatin-based in 44 patients and ifosfamide-based in six patients. In the whole group, baseline mean Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue score was 19. 7 (± 6. 4; standard deviation) and the mean plasma carnitine value was 20. 9 [*]μM (± 6. 8; standard deviation). After 1 week, fatigue ameliorated in 45 patients and the mean Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue score was 34. 9 (± 5. 4; standard deviation) (P<. 001). All patients achieved normal plasma carnitine levels. Patients maintained the improved Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue score until the next cycle of chemotherapy. In selected patients, <b>levocarnitine</b> supplementation may be effective in alleviating chemotherapy-induced fatigue.

Results The patient presented limb weakness, difficulty in raising head and dysphagia, which were typical clinical features of lipid storage myopathy (LSM). The serum creatine kinase (CK) level and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level elevated evidently. EMG showed myogenic abnormality, and muscular pathology revealed numerous lipid droplets deposited in the fibers. ATPase staining showed predominant atrophy of typeⅠ fibers and relative increasing of the portion of typeⅡ fibers. Modified Gomori trichrome (MGT) staining did not observe ragged red fibers. Immunohistochemical staining showed positive expression of dystrophin. Sultan Ⅲ staining revealed multiple vacuolated myofibers. ETFDH gene test showed two heterozygous mutations in the patient. After treating with <b>levocarnitine</b> for several years, the patient could live a normal life. The muscular pathological result returned to normal.

40|$|Background: Centenarians are {{characterized}} by weakness, decreasing mental health, impaired mobility, and poor endurance. L-Carnitine is an important contributor to cellular energy metabolism. Objective: This study evaluated the efficacy of L-carnitine on physical and mental fatigue and on cognitive functions of centenarians. Design: This was a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, 2 -phase study. Sixty-six centenarians with onset of fatigue after even slight physical activity were recruited to the study. The 2 groups received either 2 g <b>levocarnitine</b> once daily (n = 3 D 32) or placebo (n = 3 D 34). Efficacy measures included changes in total fat mass, total muscle mass, serum triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Activities of Daily Living, and a 6 -min walking corridor test. Results: At {{the end of the}} study period, the levocarnitine-treated centenarians, compared with the placebo group, showed significant improvements in the following markers: total fat mass (9 ̆ 61. 80 compared with 0. 6 kg; P < 0. 01), total muscle mass (3. 80 compared with 0. 8 kg; P < 0. 01), plasma concentrations of total carnitine (12. 60 compared with 9 ̆ 61. 70 5 mol; P < 0. 05), plasma long-chain acylcarnitine (1. 50 compared with 9 ̆ 60. 1 5 mol; P < 0. 001), and plasma short-chain acylcarnitine (6. 0 compared with 9 ̆ 61. 50 5 mol; P < 0. 001). Significant differences were also found in physical fatigue (9 ̆ 64. 10 compared with 9 ̆ 61. 10; P < 0. 01), mental fatigue (9 ̆ 62. 70 compared with 0. 30; P < 0. 001), fatigue severity (9 ̆ 623. 60 compared with 1. 90; P < 0. 001), and MMSE (4. 1 compared with 0. 6; P < 0. 001).

Method: A literature review was conducted using the MEDLine search terms: ‘autism ’ OR ‘autism spectrum disorder’ {{with the following}} limits: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), human trials, English language. Additional articles were identified from reference information. Trials involving nutritional supplements, hormones or drugs not approved by either Health Canada or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were excluded from analysis. Results: Twenty-three RCTs that met criteria were identified. The greatest number of RCTs involved risperidone, with six of seven placebo-controlled risperidone trials reporting statistically significant improvements on the primary outcome measure. Two aripiprazole RCTs and one olanzapine RCT reported statistically significant improvement in primary outcome measures. Haloperidol was superior to both clomipramine and placebo in a head-to-head crossover trial, while risperidone was superior to haloperidol for treatment of behavioural symptoms in a separate head-to-head trial.

MethodsHigh-fat diet feeding and intraperitoneal injection of pituitrin was performed on rats in model group and CHD Model of rats was built. Rats with successful model-building were selected and divided into L-CN group and Ctrl group randomly. Rats in L-CN group were given L-CN treatment, with intraperitoneal injection of 200  mg·kg− 1 ·d− 1 and successive administration for 3  d. Rats in Ctrl group were given equal volumes of normal saline. Blood was collected from carotid artery at different time and expression quantity of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and Troponin Ⅰ (TnⅠ) in serum was detected. Rats in each group were put to death and were separated to obtain the myocardial tissue. Real-time PCR and Western Blotting hybridization were performed to detect the TIMP- 1, ICAM- 1 expression in myocardial tissue in each group. Statistical analysis was employed to explore the expression changes of TIMP- 1 and ICAM- 1, and ELISA {{test was used to}} analyze the expression changes of myocardial necrosis marker-CK-MB and TnⅠto learn {{the effect of}} L-CN and its myocardial protective effect. ResultsThe total cholesterol, triglyceride and blood glucose levels of rats in model group were significantly higher than that in control group, which indicated that due to high-fat diet feeding, blood lipid of rats in model group was obviously higher than that in control group. In myocardial tissue of rats in model group, TIMP- 1 level significantly reduced and ICAM- 1 level significantly increased (P <  0. 01). In model group, after L-CN treatment, TIMP- 1 level had double increase, while ICAM- 1 level had 43 % of decrease in L-CN group compared with Ctrl group. After L-CN intervention treatment, CK-MB and TnⅠ content in L-CN group relatively reduced compared with Ctrl group. The difference among groups was obvious (P <  0. 01).

Neurological examination demonstrated impaired orientation to time and place; hearing impairment of right ear; normal muscle force in upper limbs, proximal lower muscle force was 2 and distal was 0; normal tendon reflex in both upper limbs; diminished tendon reflex in both lower limbs; left palmomental reflex (+); bilateral Babinski sign (+). Below T 10 : diminished superficial, deep sensation and cortical sensory. Cranial MRI on admission revealed widened sulci in bilateral cleft and frontal, temporal and insular lobes, indicating brain atrophy. Spinal MRI revealed high-intensity signals of C 3 - 7 level and T 1 - 12 level. The patient was diagnosed as “neuromyelitis optica (NMO) ” at first, but cognitive impairment is really rare in NMO. It finally {{turned out to be}} “inherited metabolic diseases” with the negative results of aquaporin 4 (AQP 4), NMO-IgG, GM 1, voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) from serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The elevated level of plasm homocysteine [30. 79 mmol/L (5 - 20 mmol/L) ] and urine methylmalonic acid [0. 40 mmol/L (0. 001 mmol/L) ] ascertained the diagnosis of methylmalonic acidemia.

Hypotheses regarding cytokines and growth {{factors related to}} sickness behavior and disruption of circadian signaling have been proposed. Objectives: We prospectively examined proinflammatory cytokines (e. g., sickness behavior model) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands (e. g., circadian disruption model) in the serum of cancer patients enrolled in a clinical trial testing <b>levocarnitine</b> for fatigue. Methods: Serum samples were collected at baseline and week 4. Cytokine/growth factor analyses were performed with a Luminex analyzer. The Brief Fatigue Index and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Index were used to measure fatigue and depression severity. The association between cytokine and symptoms was examined using logistic models. Results: Among 101 analyzable patients, all ten cytokines/growth factors examined were highly elevated at baseline and all significantly decreased at week 4 (p< 0. 001) regardless of treatment intervention. At baseline, the odds of severe fatigue significantly increased for patients with higher level of interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra), whereas patients {{with higher levels of}} IL- 1 Ra, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 8, interferon-γ, transforming growth factor α, and vascular endothelial growth factor had higher odds of severe depression. At week 4, fatigue (p= 0. 023) and depression (p= 0. 007) responders had less decrease in IL- 1 level than the corresponding non-responders. Conclusion: In this correlative analysis of a fatigue clinical trial, levels of fatigue were significantly associated with levels of IL- 1 and IL- 1 Ra. Circadian-signaling pathways related to EGFR signaling were correlated with depression as were other cytokines. A major placebo effect was associated with a global decrease in cytokine and growth factors. These data provide further basis for testing hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of fatigue and depression in cancer patients.

40|$|Abstract Systemic primary {{carnitine}} deficiency (CDSP) is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder of carnitine transportation. The clinical manifestations of CDSP can vary widely {{with respect to}} age of onset, organ involvement, and severity of symptoms, but are typically characterized by episodes of hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, elevated transaminases, and hyperammonemia in infants; skeletal myopathy, elevated creatine kinase (CK), and cardiomyopathy in childhood; or cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, or fatigability in adulthood. The diagnosis can be suspected on newborn screening, but is established by demonstration of low plasma free carnitine concentration (SLC 22 A 5 gene. The incidence of CDSP varies depending on ethnicity; however the frequency in the United States {{is estimated to be}} approximately 1 in 50, 000 individuals based on newborn screening data. CDSP is caused by recessive mutations in the SLC 22 A 5 gene. This gene encodes organic cation transporter type 2 (OCTN 2) which transport carnitine across cell membranes. Over 100 mutations have been reported in this gene with the c. 136 C[*]>[*]T (p. P 46 S) mutation being the most frequent mutation identified. CDSP should be differentiated from secondary causes of carnitine deficiency such as various organic acidemias and fatty acid oxidation defects. CDSP is an autosomal recessive condition; therefore the recurrence risk in each pregnancy is 25 %. Carrier screening for at-risk individuals and family members should be obtained by performing targeted mutation analysis of the SLC 22 A 5 gene since plasma carnitine analysis is not a sufficient methodology for determining carrier status. Antenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk of CDSP is possible by molecular genetic testing of extracted DNA from chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis if both mutations in SLC 22 A 5 gene are known. Once the diagnosis of CDSP is established in an individual, an echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, CK concentration, liver transaminanses measurement, and pre-prandial blood sugar levels, should be performed for baseline assessment. Primary treatment involves supplementation of oral <b>levocarnitine</b> (L-carnitine) at a dose of 50 – 400 mg/kg/day divided into three doses. No formal surveillance guidelines for individuals with CDSP have been established to date, however the following screening recommendations are suggested: annual echocardiogram and electrocardiogram, frequent plasma carnitine levels, and CK and liver transaminases measurement can be considered during acute illness. Adult women with CDSP who are planning to or are pregnant should meet with a metabolic or genetic specialist ideally before conception to discuss management of carnitine levels during pregnancy since carnitine levels are typically lower during pregnancy. The prognosis for individuals with CDSP depends on the age, presentation, and severity of symptoms at the time of diagnosis; however the long-term prognosis is favorable as long as individuals remain on carnitine supplementation. </p...|$|E
