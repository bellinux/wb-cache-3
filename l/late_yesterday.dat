40|$|Denver has “closed” again {{due to the}} Spanish {{influenza}} epidemic. Mayor Mills and Dr. Sharpley {{issued the}} order {{on the advice of}} the city medical advisory committee. • All precautions in place during the first closure (from 10 / 6 to 11 / 11) are in effect again. Rules will be more strict during this closure. • The new closure order was decided upon suddenly and took Denver residents by surprise. • “Denver had believed the flu danger over, based on decreases in the number of cases reported and deaths. Even as <b>late</b> as <b>yesterday</b> afternoon the official information carried in the newspapers was all favorable, but the medical advisers of the city officials say that the flu was not being stamped out, and only drastic action could bring about the result. ”• “Managers of all the theaters and big moving picture houses, and employes [sic] of these houses, protested vigorously at the closing order. They pointed out that neither New York nor Chicago closed theaters, and both cities stamped out the flu. All were a unit in declaring that they were perfectly willing to observe all regulations, even to giving their patrons masks, but that they considered the order applying to them as discriminating. ”• Dr. Sharpley: “The people really brought it on themselves by the Victory celebration, but that couldn’t have been prevented and should have been. It was certain that with tens of thousands thronging the streets that there would be hundreds of influenza affected persons, and that they [?] would be distributed. It was also to be expected that the opening of the city would result in more cases. However, I sounded this warning and declared that an increase in cases could be expected but that I did not believe there was any cause for alarm {{on the part of the}} people. It is difficult to say when the ban now ordered on will be lifted. I would not hazard a guess. The lifting of this ban is wholly in the hands of the advisory committee, composed of representative Denver physicians, and I am sure that the action taken by this committee was because it was the only way the committee saw of saving life and finally stamping out the plague in Denver. ”• Visiting people who are sick with influenza is forbidden, even for family members. Anyone who is caught doing so can be arrested. “During the epidemic, the greatest trouble has been to keep relatives and friends from visiting these infected houses and it was decided that the only way to break it up was to arrest the offenders. ” The rule will be “rigidly enforced,” no matter the offender’s identity or position. • Only 65 people at a time are allowed on streetcars. This rule will be “enforced to the letter. ” The conductors are responsible for keeping track of how many passengers are in their cars. • People are required to wear masks when they enter stores. There will be an employee stationed at the door who will hand each customer a mask on their way in. If a customer refuses to wear a mask, they will have to leave the store. Clerks are not required to wear masks but health officials recommend that they do, for their own protection. All people entering factories must wear masks. This rule applies in general to the entrance of any populated place. Wearing masks on the streets is not compulsory but is recommended. Medical advisory committee recommends that people wear masks, especially on streetcars. Masks can be obtained at the Red Cross office and at the department of health. • Three emergency hospitals are being established in Denver at El Jebel temple (for men), the old Progress Club hall (for women), and the Children’s hospital (for children). This decision is meant to counteract the shortage of nurses and make sure that all residents of Denver have proper care, to prevent fatalities. Thought that the majority of the patients will come from “foreign settlements,” where influenza has hit especially hard. • All schools will be closed, even though they’ve only been open one week. • All public gatherings are strongly discouraged. Dr. Sharpley says that this rule will be strictly enforced, more so than last time. • “It is estimated by Dr. Sharpley that the number of cases could be nearly doubled for the whole period of the influenza epidemic as in the beginning it was not compulsory on the part of physicians to report. ” The compulsory order to report cases was issued when the closing ban was lifted on 11 / 11. • Names of the dead reported.

6000|$|Washington, May 13, 1864, 2 o'clock p. m. DEAREST MOTHER--I wrote you a hurried letter <b>late</b> <b>yesterday</b> {{afternoon}} {{but left}} it {{myself at the}} P. O. {{in time for the}} mail. You ought to have got it this forenoon, or afternoon at furthest. I sent you two letters yesterday. I hope the carrier brings you your letters the same day. I wrote to the Brooklyn postmaster about it. I have heard from George up to Tuesday morning last, 10th, till which time he was safe. The battle of Friday, 6th, was very severe. George's Co. K lost one acting sergeant, Sturgis, killed, 2 men killed, 4 wounded. As I wrote yesterday, I have seen here Corp. Fred Saunders of Co. K, who was wounded in side, nothing serious, in Friday's fight, and came up here. I also talked with Serg. Brown, Co. F, 51st, rather badly wounded in right shoulder. Saunders said, when he left Tuesday morning he heard (or saw them there, I forget which) the 51st and its whole division were on guard duty toward the rear. The 9th Corps, however, has had hard fighting since, but whether the division or brigade the 51st is in was in the fights of Tuesday, 10th, (a pretty severe one) or Wednesday, I cannot tell, and it is useless to make calculations--and the only way is to wait and hope for the best. As I wrote yesterday, there were some 30 of 51st reg't killed and 50 wounded in Friday's battle, 6th inst. I have seen Col. Le Gendre. He is here in Washington not far from where I am, 485 12th st. is his address. Poor man, I felt sorry indeed for him. He is badly wounded and disfigured. He is shot through the bridge of the nose, and left eye probably lost. I spent a little time with him this forenoon. He is suffering very much, spoke of George very kindly; said [...] "Your brother is well." [...] His orderly told me he saw him, George, Sunday night last, well. Fred McReady is wounded in hip, I believe bone fractured--bad enough, but not deeply serious. I cannot hear of his arrival here. If he comes I shall find him immediately and take care of him myself. He is probably yet at Fredericksburg, but will come up, I think. Yesterday and to-day the badly wounded are coming in. The long lists of previous arrivals, (I suppose they are all reprinted at great length in N. Y. papers) are of men three-fourths of them quite slightly wounded, and the rest hurt pretty bad. I was thinking, mother, if one could see the men who arrived in the first squads, of two or three hundred at a time, one wouldn't be alarmed at those terrible long lists. Still there is a sufficient sprinkling of deeply distressing cases. I find my hands full all the time, with new and old cases--poor suffering young men, I think of them, and do try, mother, to do what I can for them, (and not think of the vexatious skedaddlers and merely scratched ones, of whom there are too many lately come here).|$|E
