He said he was [...] "appalled that one in four Kentuckians now get their health insurance from Medicaid". He then advocated modifying the state's Medicaid system to require those insured by Medicaid to contribute small premiums or co-payments, citing a system similar to Indiana's. The Kentucky General Assembly would have to effect such changes through legislation, but the debate moderator told Bevin he could end the expansion entirely with an executive order. Bevin responded, [...] "And create what degree of chaos?"

[...] In the post-debate press conference, Lexington Herald-Leader columnist Sam Youngman confirmed that Bevin had said he would [...] "end" [...] the Medicaid expansion. Bevin then said, [...] "Yeah, well, here's the bottom line: We need to address the situation. We need to effectively come up with a program that works for folks." [...] At a September campaign stop at a local Dairy Queen, Bevin promised only to [...] "tweak" [...] Beshear's Medicaid expansion. Later in the month, he told a reporter [...] "e will not continue to enroll people at 138 percent of the federal poverty level ," [...] adding [...] "The bottom line is this: Even if we don't continue to enroll people at 138 percent, there will be the 850-some odd thousand that were on it before the expansion and the other 400-and some odd thousand that are on it right now. They will continue to be on it until we come up with a solution. But {{we are not going to}} re-enroll people at 138 percent."

Section 3 <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call ‘production measures’, which arise from thinking of causes as jointly sufficient for their effects. Finally, section 4 examines the important question of whether there is any sense in which an agent is more responsible for an outcome in virtue of her action being more of a cause of it. I describe a puzzle that emerges from this question, first discussed by Bernstein (2017) and Sartorio (2015), and explore various strategies for resolving it. </p...|$|R

60|$|Making speeches without {{preparation}} is no gift of mine; and I was resolved to shirk any new opportunity, {{but in the}} next and larger Sunday-school I found myself {{in the rear of the}} assemblage; so I was very willing to go on the platform a moment for the sake of getting a good look at the scholars.

They say in the Aran Islands that if you speak overmuch of the things of Faery your tongue becomes like a stone, and it seems to me, though doubtless naturalistic reason would call it Auto-suggestion or the like, that I have often felt my tongue become just so heavy and clumsy. More than once, too, as I wrote this very essay I have become uneasy, and have torn up some paragraph, not for any literary reason, but because some incident or some symbol that would perhaps have meant nothing to the reader, seemed, I know not why, to belong to hidden things. Yet I must write or be of no account to any cause, good or evil; I must commit what merchandise of wisdom I have to this ship of written speech, and after all, I have many a time watched it put out to sea with not less alarm when all the speech was rhyme. We who write, we who bear witness, must often hear our hearts cry out against us, complaining because of their hidden things, and I know not but he who speaks of wisdom may not sometimes in the change that is coming upon the world, have to fear the anger of the people of Faery, whose country is the heart of the world--'The Land of the Living Heart.' Who can keep always to the little pathway between speech and silence, where one meets none but discreet revelations? And surely, at whatever risk, we must cry out that imagination is always seeking to remake the world according to the impulses and the patterns in that great Mind, and that great Memory? Can there be anything so important as to cry out that what we call romance, poetry, intellectual beauty, is the only signal that the supreme Enchanter, or some one in His councils, is speaking of what has been, and shall be again, in the consummation of time? ...|$|E

40|$|Gendered “realness” and {{its social}} and {{political}} effects {{are at the heart}} of transgender issues. “Realness” operates both as a structure for trans intelligibility and its process of containment, for its representation and its erasure. Power works through the concept of gendered “realness” in ways that force trans people to evoke a core, stable gender identity in order to prove their social and legal legitimacy; at the same time, the slippery nature of “realness,” its cultural power, and its ability to escape the parameters of determinacy, allow it to be harnessed in social, legal and institutional contexts in ways that undermine trans identities. By <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> refer to as “the politics of the real” I analyze gendered “realness” as an operation of power which circulates throughout United States having particular concrete, material effects for trans people. Through an analysis of transgender representation in photography, popular film, feminist theory, and legal cases, I explore the paradoxical nature of “realness” and its function in both dominant culture and transgender communities. As a driving concept for transgender representation and as a strategy for resistance, “realness” needs to be analyzed and evaluated. ...|$|R

I was asked what might be the reasons why forces are facing difficulties in persuading officers to become or stay detectives. I spoke about the risks which detectives carry in a caseload, some of which will be both complex and involve crimes of an intensely distressing nature, including crimes of violence, abuse and sexual exploitation. Response and neighbourhood policing are undoubtedly stressful. Police officers and staff who deal with the many dreadful things which people do to others, or which happen to them, most certainly do not leave them behind; they take them home, and in many cases they stay with them forever. This was illustrated by some of the harrowing examples on Twitter yesterday.

40|$|Ferzan Özpetek’s {{films are}} known for overtly {{breaching}} the subject of queer identities in Italian mainstream cinema. Popular music, however, often complicates the inclusive representations claimed by films in which queer and other non-dominant identities are visible. Where these identities are positioned and which space their members can claim are other key factors for a critical appraisal of their representations. Songs and their placement can produce different associative audiovisual combinations between Italian and non-Italian music on the one hand, and queer and other non-dominant identities on the other. The few camp songs heard where queer characters are shown outside their space and their systematic aural erasure illustrate the limited ‘audibility’ these films allow for queer identities despite their visibility. In this article I discuss the interaction between popular music and space in the films of Ferzan Özpetek, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> term ‘conditions of the audible’ and considering how these audiovisual representations can situate queer identities in the shifting landscape of Italian mainstream cinema. The way these identities are spatially and musically contained, I argue, can complicate their newly-found visibility and the transnational dimension in which Özpetek’s films are often located. While Özpetek did make queer identities visible, these representations inescapably negotiate the national – a dimension where queerness remains spatially and musically contained and Othered...|$|R

In my teaching, I discovered I tried many different strategies to help my students be successful. I was very deliberate in my language and usage of vocabulary words and also in my explanations of various math concepts. As a result of this research, I plan to continue having my students use writing to communicate within the mathematics classroom. I will keep using some of the strategies I found successful. I also will be very deliberate in using vocabulary words and stress the use of vocabulary words with my students in the future...|$|R
