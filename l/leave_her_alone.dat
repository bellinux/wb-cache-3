A woman named Xiangfei {{was sent to the}} prestigious Ling-Sheng Su Temple to learn the swordplay and became supremely skilled with the jian. Following her father's passing, Xiangfei forged a forbidden romance with Kong Xiuqiang, a monk at the temple and the most prominent candidate for inheritor of the holy bo staff, the Kali-Yuga. Not until the illegitimate birth of their first daughter, Xianglian, was their love made known to the other monks who remained very strict regarding the temple's edicts and so Xianglian was taken from her parents on her second birthday. Xiangfei became too wrought with grief to remain at the temple. Han Dongxiu, a sworn brother of Xiuqiang and Xiangfei, helped Xiuqiang sneak the holy Krita-Yuga sword to his lover, to serve as a promise the two would one day meet again.
