As node processors, though, can execute more instructions concurrently, they become more sensitive to the <b>rst</b> <b>level</b> memory access latency. This paper presents a set of hardware and software techniques, collectively referred toasregister preloading, to effectively tolerate long <b>rst</b> <b>level</b> memory access latency. The techniques include speculative execution, loop unrolling, dynamic memory disambiguation, and strip-mining.

40|$|Hyperheuristics {{give us the}} {{appealing}} {{possibility of}} abstracting the solution method from the problem, since our hyperheuristic, at each decision point, chooses between different <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics rather than different solutions as is usually the case for metaheuristics. By assembling <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics from parameterised components we may create {{hundreds or thousands of}} <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics, and there is increasing evidence that this is effective in dealing with every eventuality that may arise when solving different combinatorial optimisation problem instances since at each iteration the solution landscape is amenable to {{at least one of the}} <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics. However, the large number of <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics means that the hyperheuristic has to intelligently select the correct <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristic to use, to make best use of available CPU time. This paper empirically investigates several hyperheuristics designed for large collections of <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics and adapts other hyperheuristics from the literature to cope with these large sets of <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics on a difficult real- world workforce scheduling problem. In the process we empirically investigate a wide range of approaches for setting tabu tenure in hyperheuristic methods, for a complex real-world problem. The results show that the hyperheuristic methods described provide a good way to trade off CPU time and solution quality...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the prevalence and {{factors associated with}} <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> of lumbar strength in adolescents. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study involving 601 adolescents, aged 14 to 17 years, enrolled in {{public schools in the}} western region of Santa Catarina State - Southern Brazil. Lumbar strength was analyzed by the lumbar extension test developed by the Canadian Society of Exercise Physiology, which proposes different cutoffs for boys and girls. Independent variables were sex, age, socioeconomic status, dietary habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aerobic fitness. For data analysis, univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used, with significance level of 5 %. RESULTS: The prevalence of <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> of lumbar strength was 27. 3 %. The population subgroups most likely to present <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> of lumbar strength were females (OR: 1. 54, 95 % CI : 1. 06 to 2. 23), adolescents with <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> of aerobic fitness (OR: 2. 10, 95 % CI: 1. 41 to 3. 11) and the overweight (OR: 2. 28, 95 % CI: 1. 35 to 3. 81).

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in saliency detection have utilized deep learning to obtain high level features to detect salient regions in a scene. These advances have demonstrated superior results over previous works that utilize hand-crafted <b>low</b> <b>level</b> features for saliency detection. In this paper, we demonstrate that hand-crafted features can provide complementary information to enhance performance of saliency detection that utilizes only high level features. Our method utilizes both high <b>level</b> and <b>low</b> <b>level</b> features for saliency detection under a unified deep learning framework. The high level features are extracted using the VGG-net, and the <b>low</b> <b>level</b> features are {{compared with other}} parts of an image to form a <b>low</b> <b>level</b> distance map. The <b>low</b> <b>level</b> distance map is then encoded using a convolutional neural network(CNN) with multiple 1 X 1 convolutional and ReLU layers. We concatenate the encoded <b>low</b> <b>level</b> distance map and the high level features, and connect them to a fully connected neural network classifier to evaluate the saliency of a query region. Our experiments show that our method can further improve the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning-based saliency detection methods.
