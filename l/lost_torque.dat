40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} {{installation}} behavior of high-strength bolts under friction. For this purpose an experimental program was conducted to evaluate the energy of these bolts that is dissipated due to tightening and loosening. The total number of tested specimens was 100 bolts furnished to the requirements of AASHTO specification M 253 M. The turn-of-nut tightening method is applied experimentally to evaluate the pretension and the torque for tightening and loosening of bolts. It is mentioned that a number of 56 bolts has 76 mm length while the rest is of 152 mm. The experimental preloading and the <b>lost</b> <b>torque</b> that overcomes friction are compared with the respective analytical values. It is confirmed that the K-nut factor is affected by the type of lubricant and the length of the bolt. Additionally, most of torque is going to overcome friction.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Couplings between rotating machines are typically divided into two categories: rigid and flexible. Flexible couplings allow misalignment of the two shafts but introduce potential rotordynamic instabilities to the system. Holeset couplings, a type of flexible coupling, are designed to reduce the losses to the system due to such instabilities by avoiding operation at natural frequencies of the coupling. This is accomplished by designing the coupling such that the stiffness and hence natural frequencies of the coupling change as torsion increases. Existing test devices were employed to determine the rotordynamic stiffness and damping of a selection of flexible couplings. An analytical model of a simple system employing a flexible coupling was written. The data and this model were used to determine the reduction of <b>lost</b> <b>torque</b> a Holeset coupling provides over a tire type elastomer coupling. The data collected, the programs used to collect the data, and the simulation programs are presented. One of the test rigs may be modified in order to further study the dynamic properties of flexible couplings. The design of a suitable modification is also presented...|$|E

When position sensor is faulted, some phase information of commutation will be <b>lost,</b> causes <b>torque</b> decrease, affects the system reliability. Through {{the analysis of the}} fault position signals, a real-time diagnostic method that detected the edge sequences of position signals and calculated the angle between the adjacent edges of position signals is proposed. After fault of position signal is diagnosed, fault-tolerant control is carried out immediately by taking advantage of the redundant information of position signal detection scheme and the time between the adjacent edges of position signals. The validity and practicability of fault analysis, fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control is verified by simulated fault experiments on SRM. Copyright © 2013 IFSA...|$|R
40|$|Rotator cuff tears {{disrupt the}} force {{balance in the}} {{shoulder}} and the glenohumeral joint in particular, resulting in compromised arm elevation torques. The trade-off between glenohumeral torque and glenohumeral stability is not yet understood. We hypothesize that compensation of <b>lost</b> abduction <b>torque</b> {{will lead to a}} superior redirection of the reaction force vector onto the glenoid surface, which will require additional muscle forces to maintain glenohumeral stability. Muscle forces in a single arm position for five combinations of simulated cuff tears were estimated by inverse dynamic simulation (Delft Shoulder and Elbow Model) and compared with muscle forces in the non-injured condition. Each cuff tear condition was simulated both without and with an active modeling constraint for glenohumeral stability, which was defined as the condition in which the glenohumeral reaction force intersects the glenoid surface. For the simulated position an isolated tear of the supraspinatus only increased the effort of the other muscles with 8 %, and did not introduce instability. For massive cuff tears beyond the supraspinatus, instability became a prominent factor: the deltoids were not able to fully compensate <b>lost</b> net abduction <b>torque</b> without introducing destabilizing forces; unfavorable abductor muscles (i. e. in the simulated position the subscapularis and the biceps longum) remain to compensate the necessary abduction torque; the teres minor appeared to be of vital importance to maintain glenohumeral stability. Adverse adductor muscle co-contraction is essential to preserve glenohumeral stability. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the control strate-gy of a robot manipulator system. In designing the control strategy, there will be always some differ-ence between the actual behavior of the physical system and that predicted by the mathematical model. This difference brings the unstable behavior to the system. Then, it is important to assure a deg-ree of "robustness" or immunity to uncertainty or changes in the system parameters. First, in order to implement the robust control, the model reference adaptive control theory is applied to the linearlized manipulator system. Next, through the simulation studies, it is clari-fied that the stability of the system is not lost by parameters change but <b>lost</b> under <b>torque</b> constraints. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is applied to the investigation of the influence of parameter difference from nominal values on the dynamics of a robot manipulator. Through this analysis, we can find which parameters really influence to the manipulator control and which do not...|$|R
30|$|Efficient {{wellbore}} cleaning is {{an important}} goal in a drilling operation especially in horizontal and deviated wells since it can prevent problems such as stuck pipe, <b>lost</b> circulation, high <b>torque</b> and drag, loss of control on density ECDs, and finally it can {{reduce the cost of}} the drilling operations (Ozbayoglu et al. 2003).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Our primary {{goals were}} to {{determine}} whether preexisting fear of pain and pain sensitivity contributed to post-exercise pain intensity. METHODS: Delayed-onset muscle pain was induced in the trunk extensors of 60 healthy volunteers using an exercise paradigm. Levels of fear of pain and experimental pain sensitivity were measured before exercise. Pain intensity in the low back was collected at 24 and 48 hours post-exercise. Participants were grouped based on pain intensity. Group membership {{was used as the}} dependent variable in separate regression models for 24 and 48 hours. Predictor variables included fear, pain sensitivity, <b>torque</b> <b>lost</b> during the exercise protocol, and demographic variables. RESULTS: The final models predicting whether a participant reported clinically meaningful pain intensity at 24 hours only included baseline fear of pain at each level of pain intensity tested. The final model at 48 hours included average baseline pain sensitivity and the loss of muscle performance during the exercise protocol for 1 level of pain intensity tested (greater than 35 mm of 100 mm). DISCUSSION: Combined, these findings suggest that the initial reports of pain after injury may be more strongly influenced by fear whereas the inflammatory process and pain sensitivity may play a larger role for later pain intensity reports...|$|R
40|$|Shoulder {{muscle fatigue}} {{has not been}} {{assessed}} in massive rotator cuff tear (MRCT). This study used EMG to measure fatigability of 13 shoulder muscles in 14 healthy controls and 11 patients with MRCT. A hand grip protocol was applied to minimise artifacts due to pain experience during measurement. The fatigue index (median frequency slope) was significantly non-zero (negative) for anterior, middle, and posterior parts of deltoid, supraspinatus and subscapularis muscles in the controls, and for anterior, middle, and posterior parts of deltoid, and pectoralis major in patients (p ≤ 0. 001). Fatigue was significantly greater in patients compared to the controls for anterior and middle parts of deltoid and pectoralis major (p ≤ 0. 001). A submaximal grip task provided a feasible way to assess shoulder muscle fatigue in MRCT patients, however with some limitations. The results suggest increased activation of deltoid is required to compensate for <b>lost</b> supraspinatus abduction <b>torque.</b> Increased pectoralis major fatigue in patients (adduction torque) likely reflected strategy to stabilise the humeral head against superior subluxing force of the deltoid. Considering physiotherapy as a primary or adjunct intervention {{for the management of}} MRCT, {{the findings of this study}} generate a base for future clinical studies aiming at the development of evidence-based protocol...|$|R

Torque converters are used as coupling devices in automobile powertrains involving automatic transmissions. Efficient modeling of torque converters capturing various modes of operation is important for powertrain design and simulation, (Hroval and Tobler 1, Ishihara and Emori 2) optimization and control applications. Models of torque converters are available in various commercial simulation packages, Hadi et. al. 3. The information {{about the effect of}} model parameters on torque converter performance is valuable for any design operation. In this paper, a symbolic sensitivity analysis of a torque converter model will be presented. Direct differentiation (Serban and Freeman 4) is used to generate the sensitivity equations which results in equations in symbolic form. By solving the sensitivity equations, the effect of a perturbation of the model parameters on the behavior of the system is determined. A parametric importance analysis is performed on the model: the model parameters are arranged according to their effect on the amount loss of energy during the operation of the torque converter. The radii of the pump, turbine and stator, the density of the hydraulic fluid and the exit angle of the vanes of the stator were found to have the most significant effects on the model. Using the sensitivity information, a design optimization problem is defined and solved to obtain a set of parameter values that minimizes the energy <b>lost</b> during the <b>torque</b> converter operation.

40|$|A {{mechanical}} deficit due to {{a massive}} rotator cuff tear is generally concurrent to a pain-induced decrease of maximum arm elevation and peak elevation torque. The {{purpose of this study}} was to measure shoulder muscle coordination in patients with massive cuff tears, including the effect of subacromial pain suppression. Ten patients, with MRI-proven cuff tears, performed an isometric force task in which they were asked to exert a force in 24 equidistant intervals in a plane perpendicular to the humerus. By means of bi-polar surface electromyography (EMG) the direction of the maximal muscle activation or principal action of six muscles, as well as the external force, were identified prior to, and after subacromial pain suppression. Subacromial lidocaine injection led to a significant reduction of pain and a significant increase in exerted arm force. Prior to the pain suppression, we observed an activation pattern of the arm adductors (pectoralis major pars clavicularis and/or latissimus dorsi and/or teres major) during abduction force delivery in eight patients. In these eight patients, adductor activation was different from the normal adductor activation pattern. Five out of these eight restored this aberrant activity (partly) in one or more adductor muscles after subacromial lidocaine injection. Absence of glenoid directed forces of the supraspinate muscle and compensation for the <b>lost</b> supraspinate abduction <b>torque</b> by the deltoideus leads to destabilizating forces in the glenohumeral joint, with subsequent upward translation of the humeral head and pain. In order to reduce the superior translation force, arm adductors will be co-activated at the cost of arm force and abduction torque. Pain seems to be the key factor in this (avoidance) mechanism, explaining the observed limitations in arm force and limitations in maximum arm elevation in patients suffering subacromial pathologies. Masking this pain may further deteriorate the subacromial tissues as a result of proximal migration of the humeral head and subsequent impingement of subacromial tissues. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Drilling {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} cost drivers in the finding and development of oil and gas fields. More efficient drilling reduces the overall costs and enables drilling of longer wells to reach new reservoir targets. Mechanical friction and poor hole cleaning are the main limiting factors for drilling and well completion of longer wells. Poor hole cleaning can lead to costly drilling problems such as stuck pipe, reduced ROP and higher annular pressure drop leading to <b>lost</b> circulation. Excessive <b>torque</b> and drag caused by mechanical friction, often leads to the inability of reaching the target in high-angle extended reach drilling wells (ERD). Over the years, the oil industry has attempted to stretch the hydraulics and mechanical limitations for drilling longer wells. However, currently available solutions used by the oil industry are not sufficient to overcome these challenges for drilling longer wells that will be required in the future. In addition, stretching these mechanical and hydraulic limitations is essential for improving the drilling efficiency and reducing the overall well construction costs. Drilling boreholes with non-circular geometry is a new concept with step-change potential to stretch operational limits allowing drilling longer wells and more efficient well construction. This concept is based on creating helical grooves in the borehole sidewalls to improve hole cleaning and reduce the mechanical friction. Rifle shaped spiral grooves can be made in the borehole wall with the use of a specialized tool installed as a part of the bottom hole assembly (BHA). The spiral grooves can increase the wellbore cross sectional area and reduce the drill string and formation contact area. The spiral grooves can introduce swirling flow regime in the annulus which may improve the cutting transport. Reduced contact area and improved hole cleaning may reduce the overall mechanical friction. Initial flow simulations indicated differences in the flow regime of circular and non-circular wellbore geometry with integrated helical grooves inside the annulus. More uniform fluid velocity distribution and swirling flow in the non-circular geometry indicated the potential for improving hole cleaning and cutting transport in the new geometry. The objective of this PhD study was to investigate key features and further understanding of the non-circular wellbore concept. Cutting transport and wellbore cleaning as well as mechanical friction has been investigated through flow loop experiments and in the tribology laboratory. A large scale flow loop rig with concrete borehole with rotational drill string was designed and built as the tool for the main part of the PhD work. The modern flow loop includes a 12 meter long test section with a 2 " OD freely rotating drill string inside a 4 " ID wellbore made of concrete. Solid particles were injected while circulating the drilling fluid through the test section at two inclinations; horizontal and 30 o inclined from horizontal. Test results of the big scale flow loop demonstrated the difference in the hydraulics and mechanical performance of circular and non-circular wellbores geometries. For fluid and flow conditions which are relevant for oilfield applications, the results indicated lower pressure gradients and better cuttings transport in the non-circular wellbore than in a circular wellbore. In addition, the torque measurements showed lower mechanical friction in the non-circular wellbore geometry. To support the finding of reduced friction in the non-circular geometry in the flow loop setup, the mechanical friction was also studied in a tribology lab. Test results in the pin-on-disc were consistent with the results obtained from the flow loop experiments. The experiments in the tribology lab confirmed the hypothesis that reducing contact area in the non-circular wellbore geometry can decrease the mechanical friction. Such a comparative, experimental study of hole cleaning in different wellbore geometries has to our knowledge previously never been performed. The results of the present PhD work and the experimental approach could therefore be of value for any one working in the drilling industry.
