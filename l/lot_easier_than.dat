What is not known is how consumers, and particularly low-income and vulnerable consumers, have adjusted to this changed environment. From little choice in products and suppliers twenty years ago, consumers now have an enormous range of choices available to them.

40|$|Former Title : Economic {{development}} & policy seriesFormer No. : EDP 06 - 07 There {{have been}} some studies on the measurement of tax progressivity since the innovative works of Suits (1977) and Kakwani (1977). These measurements essentially rely {{on the idea of}} the Lorenz distribution of income and tax burden and the Gini concentration of inequality. Instead of such a traditional idea, this paper proposes a new measure of tax progressivity based on the relative volatility of tax revenue vis-a-vis income. The advantage of our approach is to make it possible to assess the degree of tax progressivity and to do international comparisons without any specific information about the distribution of the income and tax burden. All we need is macro data, which is a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to obtain <b>than</b> micro data. This paper also discusses some international comparisons using the new measurement...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a study undertaken {{to investigate the}} precision, reliability and usability of {{a new type of}} humidity indicators made by Alfasensor AB. The study has been carried out both in the laboratory and in situ on construction sites. The paper also sets out the experiences gained from measurements in precast construction and in existing buildings. In the laboratory investigation, the precision of the readings given by three types of Probiks indicators, CO, BI and HU, was examined by three methods. The results showed that the readings given by the indicators were slightly temperature dependent but were otherwise reliable and had a satisfactory high precision. The investigation in 7 existing buildings showed that the indicators were reliable and are a good alternative to a traditional moisture logger. The Probiks indicators are a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to read <b>than</b> traditional loggers if one is only interested in the highest RH level during the measurement period. In addition, the indicators need no batteries and are cheaper for a property owner to buy. In new construction, the investigation showed that the indicators {{can be used in a}} number of different contexts to check that the climate is not too humid. This can serve as part of the builder’s acceptance or quality inspection. 1...|$|R

50|$|The arquebus {{was more}} {{sensitive}} to humid weather. At the Battle of Villalar, rebel troops experienced a significant defeat partially due to having {{a high proportion of}} arquebusiers in a rainstorm which rendered the weapons useless. Gunpowder also ages much faster than a bolt or an arrow, particularly if improperly stored. Also, the resources needed to make gunpowder were less universally available than the resources needed to make bolts and arrows. Finding and reusing arrows or bolts was a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> doing the same with arquebus bullets. This was a useful way to reduce the cost of practice, or resupply oneself if control of the battlefield after a battle was retained. A bullet must fit a barrel much more precisely than an arrow or bolt must fit a bow, so the arquebus required more standardization and made it harder to resupply by looting bodies of fallen soldiers. Gunpowder production was also far more dangerous than arrow production.|$|E

Jeff Gordon slipped on the restart and fell to eighth. Just ahead of the scheduled competition caution, Denny Hamlin hit the wall in turn three after a tire blowout, and caused the first caution of the race. Hamlin described his impact as [...] "definitely a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> some of the hits I've taken in the past", but was uninjured in the incident. Keselowski led the field to the green on the restart on lap 35, starting a lengthy green-flag run, before the race's second caution on lap 77, caused by Kyle Larson hitting the wall in turn 1.

50|$|Starting in 1919 Kelsey {{was talking}} to a {{successful}} Detroit manufacturer by the name of Standish Backish who showed interest in putting together an expedition to the Near East. Backish {{was talking to}} a professor, by the name of Caspar Rene Gregory, who, after he died in World War I, inspired him organize an expedition for the retrieval of biblical documents. Standish considered himself too old, so he asked Kelsey to lead it. Kelsey agreed and fundraising started, being quite a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> last time. For some reason investors found archaeology a bit more intriguing than organs. Backish would prove to be helpful through the entire process, assisting with financial issues and navigating in Europe when the World War I had just ended. This first expedition would start by ship from the East Coast to Glasgow, making its way to London, then Paris and eventually towards Constantinople, Near East, and Asia Minor. The entire expedition was expected to take two years, one for exploration and the other for writing and research which would be done between London and Paris since at the time, that is where the only copies of other ancient manuscripts were located. While originally Backish suggested that the main objective be for the retrieval of biblical texts, it was also brought up that documentation of the battlefields that Julius Caesar fought on should also be researched and heavily photographed. Overall the expedition was a huge success, Kelsey returned with Isabelle and Easton to Ann Arbor in 1921 to resume teaching and to even more renown than before. He would go on a second expedition in 1927 that would yield even more antiquities and papyrus, specifically from Egypt. Unfortunately just after returning from his last expedition he started feeling chest pains.|$|E
