It was {{for a short time}} used as a trout farm, but was {{threatened}} with demolition, as an alternative to repair. In 2003 Bath and North East Somerset council put the site up for sale or <b>long</b> <b>lease,</b> and it was added to the English Heritage Buildings at Risk Register. A trust was formed in 2005 to rescue the pool from dilapidation. In 2006 its listed building status was raised from II to II* as it is considered particularly important buildings of more than special interest.|$|E

50|$|The {{comparative}} {{rarity of}} <b>long</b> residential <b>leases</b> in Scotland was made rarer by the <b>Long</b> <b>Leases</b> (Scotland) Act 1954. Under its provisions <b>long</b> <b>leases</b> of dwelling-houses, granted prior to 10 August 1914 {{for a period}} of at least fifty years, could be converted into feus by the tenant serving notice on the landlord. As the notice had to be served within five years of the Act of 1954coming into force (i.e. before 1 September 1959) this provision is now spent. But while it was in force the number of tenants taking up the option had the effect of making <b>long</b> residential <b>leases</b> even less common than they were before.|$|R

Michael became president of the Hampstead General Hospital, to which he donated an ambulance, as well as president of the Hampstead Art Society.

25|$|The {{land that}} now makes up Edgbaston Cricket Ground was {{originally}} {{owned by the}} Calthorpe Estate, who have now sold the site onto Wylam Investments (Edgbaston Holdings) on a <b>long</b> <b>lease.</b> Calthorpe Estates had developed the manor of Edgbaston into an exclusive Birmingham suburb {{over the course of}} the 19th century, and believed that a cricket ground would be an asset that would add to the genteel image of the area. Warwickshire County Cricket Club had considered Rugby and Leamington Spa for their headquarters, but club secretary William Ansell believed that Birmingham's large population and comprehensive railway connections made it preferable – envisaging first-class status for the county and Test status for the ground.|$|E

25|$|The Act did {{not provide}} the normal {{provisions}} for raising capital for the construction, as finance could only be obtained by leasing of the tolls. When completed, the commissioners leased the tolls to Charles Chaplin, who held ten shares and was also a commissioner, for an initial period of seven years. When the lease was due for renewal, no other takers were found, and Chaplin was granted a 99-year lease, {{despite the fact that}} the Act did not authorise such an action. He collected the tolls but failed to maintain the navigation. When complaints were received, a new Act of Parliament was obtained in 1828, to alter the tolls and legalise Chaplin's <b>long</b> <b>lease.</b> The lease was transferred to two railway companies in 1847, and reverted to the commissioners in 1876. The operation was a moderate success until the beginning of the twentieth century, when there was a rapid decline in income, and the canal formally closed in 1924.|$|E

500|$|In 1953 it was {{announced}} that the fort was to be available on a <b>long</b> <b>lease,</b> and a 99-year lease on the fort was bought by The Honourable Gerald Lascelles in 1955. Lascelles was the son of Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood and Mary, Princess Royal, the only daughter of King George V and Mary of Teck. Lascelles was a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. He lived at the fort with his wife, Angela, and their son, Henry. Lascelles described the house as 'falling to pieces' {{at the beginning of his}} occupancy, and refurbished the fort, removing most traces of Edward's renovations in the process, except for the swimming pool and the battlements walk. The 30–40 rooms of the fort were reduced by the Lascelles to the [...] "equivalent of an eight-bedroom house, including quarters for three or four staff. It will be a very manageable home". Angela Lascelles remained dedicated to improving and renovating the house and maintaining the estate. The Lascelles's restoration of the fort was undertaken by the designer Stanley Peters who took three years to return it to its 18th-century state; Peters faced difficulties in removing offices added when Edward became king. A mural added by Peters in the drawing-room, and painted by Oliver Carson, depicted Peters in an incidental role, portrayed in 18th-century clothes chasing butterflies. The Lascelles later claimed the credit for Peters's designs and his career suffered irreparable damage as a result.|$|E

500|$|Because of a {{potential}} liability for £10,000 of renovation work upon the expiry of the lease, Betjeman considered the house too costly to maintain, and subsequently vacated it. From 1962 to 1966, the house stood empty and suffered vandalism and neglect. [...] A survey undertaken in January 1965 revealed that the exterior stonework was badly decayed, dry rot had eaten through the roof and the structural floor timbers, and the attics were infested with pigeons. Vandals had stripped the lead from the water tanks and had damaged the mirrors, fireplaces and carving work. The most notable loss was the theft of the carved figure of Fame from the Dining Room chimneypiece. Betjeman suggested that the owner's agents had deliberately refused to let the house, and allowed it to decline, intending to demolish it and redevelop the site. Writing in Country Life in 1966, Charles Handley-Read took a different view saying that [...] "the Ilchester Estate, upon which the house is situated, are anxious {{that it should be}} preserved and [...] entered into a <b>long</b> <b>lease</b> conditional upon the house being put into a state of good repair." [...] In March 1965, the Historic Buildings Council obtained a preservation order on the house, enabling the purchaser of the lease, Lady Jane Turnbull, daughter of William Grey, 9th Earl of Stamford, to initiate a programme of restoration the following July. These renovations were supported by grants of £4,000 from the Historic Buildings Council and £3,000 from the Greater London Council. [...] The lease was sold in 1969.|$|E
