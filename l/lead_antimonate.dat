40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the study}} is to {{understand}} how antimonate opacifying crystals were obtained throughout history. Two archaeological glass productions opacified with calcium and <b>lead</b> <b>antimonates</b> are studied in this paper, in order to rediscover ancient opaque glass technologies: Roman mosaic tesserae (1 st cent. B. C. - 4 th cent. A. D.) and Nevers lampworking glass (18 th cent. A. D.). The fine examination of crystalline phases and of the vitreous matrix is undertaken using various and complementary techniques. Results are compared with a modern reference production, for which the technological process is well known. We demonstrate that Ca-antimonate opacifiers in Roman mosaic tesserae, as well as in Nevers lampworking glass, were obtained by in situ crystallization. Nevertheless, Roman and Nevers glass would have undergone different firing processes. We propose that the addition of previously synthesized crystals or the use of "anime" could be the process used to obtain Pb-antimonate opacified glass, for both productions studied. We demonstrate that CaO, PbO and Sb 2 O 3 concentrations in the bulk compositions and in the matrices, and their evolution with the crystallinity ratio, offer robust criteria for the distinction of the opacification process used. Also, the different crystalline structures help to provide information on the experimental condition...|$|R
40|$|A {{large sample}} set of {{transparent}} and opaque glass artefacts recovered from Etruscan contexts innorthern Italy (Bologna and Spina (FE) necropoleis) and dated to a {{period between the}} 6 th and 4 thcentury BC are analysed in this paper. Samples of highly decorated beads, spindle whorls and vessels ofthe ‘Mediterranean Group I’ (Alabastron, Oinochoes, Amphoriskos) were selected in order to determinewhether these different glass artefacts were produced at the same manufacturing site. While the vesselsalmost certainly originate from Greece, the beads could derive from a more ancient local productionascertained {{at the site of}} Frattesina (Rovigo, Italy) and dated to the Bronze Age. The aims of this study are: (i) to characterise a set of Iron Age glass artefacts, thus providing newquantitative chemical data; and (ii) to identify possible differences between finds recovered fromdifferent localities and between glass vessels and beads, in order to establish whether different manufactureswere active contemporaneously. The chemical analyses of major and minor elements were performed with an electron microprobe. Thenature of the opacifying and colouring agents was determined by X-ray diffraction. The sample set isrelatively homogeneous and most of the samples can be classified as low magnesium glass. The yellowopaque decorations are rich in Pb and Sb, while only Sb is present in the white and light blue samples. The XRD analyses confirmed the presence of <b>lead</b> <b>antimonates</b> in the yellow decorations and of calciumantimonates in the white and light blue decorations...|$|R
40|$|This work {{reports the}} results of an archaeometrical {{investigation}} performed, through a multitechniqueapproach, on a series of Roman glass mosaic tesserae found in Pompeii excavations. Chemical and mineralogical analyses of mosaic tesserae of different colours were performed inorder to single out the colouring and opacifying agents employed in Roman times. Moreover, dueto the paucity of information on the production technology of mosaic tesserae, the chemical dataare compared with that of common transparent glass found at the same site, in order to evaluatewhether vessels and mosaic tiles could have been prepared with the same recipes and startingfrom the same glass batch. The chemical analyses were performed by Electron Microprobe,whereas the mineralogical investigation on the opaque samples were carried out by couplingScanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray Powder Diffraction. The results obtained show that allthe analysed samples have the typical composition of natron-based glass. The similarities with thechemical composition - {{at least in terms of}} major elements - of common translucent glass couldsuggest the use of the same raw materials for the preparation of the batch. All opaque blue andgreen tesserae contain crystalline aggregates respectively of calcium and <b>lead</b> <b>antimonates,</b> exceptone blue tessera, which contains traces of cuprorivaite and quartz (Egyptian blue pigment).

50|$|Ancient milk glasses used {{crystals}} {{of calcium}} antimonate, {{formed in the}} melt from calcium present in the glass and an antimony additive. Opaque yellow glasses contained crystals of lead antimonate; bindheimite mineral {{may have been used}} as the additive. Under oxidizing condition, lead also forms incompletely dissolved lead pyroantimonate (Pb2Sb2O7). From 2nd century BC tin oxide appears in use as opacifier, likely in the form of cassiterite mineral. Opaque yellow can be produced as lead stannate; the color is paler than the <b>lead</b> <b>antimonate</b> one. Later calcium and sodium phosphates became used; bone ash contains calcium phosphate in a high proportion. Calcium fluoride was also used, especially in China.|$|E
30|$|As the Pb 2 Sb 2 O 7 {{structure}} is of pyrochlore type, it can accommodate other cations (like Fe, Cu) {{in the main}} framework [17, 18]. The cubic Pb 2 Sb 2 O 7 structure corresponds to the bindheimite mineral which has yellow colour, therefore the opacifier colour cannot explain alone the tesserae green colour. “Copper green” colours could be result of yellow <b>lead</b> <b>antimonate</b> particles which also contain Copper and the variability of green tonality {{is due to the}} abundance of copper and contribution of bindheimite crystals (yellow <b>lead</b> <b>antimonate)</b> in varying amounts [19].|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{a series of}} {{fragments}} of Egyptian unguentaria are characterized from the chemical and physical point of view. The analysed samples were produced in {{the first step of}} the Egyptian glass production, during the new Kingdom of Egypt. The glass production in Egypt started under Thumosis III kingdom and developed until it reached its maximum during the kingdom of Amenhotep III (XVIII dinasty, 1390 - 1352 BC.) e Amenhotep IV/Akhenaton (XVIII dinasty, 1352 - 1338 BC). In this period, different glass shapes and typologies appears, and also the variety of decorations and colours increased. The analysed samples pertain to six vessels (amphoriskoi and krateriskoi) coming from Thebes area and now stored at the Egyptian Museum of Turin (Italy) after the excavation carried out at the Valley of the Queens. All these vessels, are blue with yellow, white and turquoise decorations and were produced with the core forming technique. The chemical analyses of major and minor elements were performed by Electron Microprobe (EMPA). The nature of the opacifying and colouring agents was determined by X-ray powder diffraction. Since only micro volumes were sampled from the artefacts (less than 1 mm 3), the diffraction experiments were successfully carried out using a single crystal diffractometer equipped with a CCD camera. The chemical data obtained show that all the samples contain high levels of Na 2 O. However, along with a number of glass containing rather high level of both MgO and K 2 O - thus classified as plant ash based glass - some of them show rather low levels of K 2 O along with high MgO percentages. Most of these low-potassium high-magnesium samples are Al- rich Co-bearing blue glass: this seems to indicate they were probably coloured with the addition of Co-bearing alum. This is also consistent with the high level of MnO present in these samples. This situation suggests the use of two different kinds of flux for the production of these glass: an organic source (for the production of most of yellow, white and turquoise glass) and an inorganic one (leading to lower levels of K and Mg) used for the production of the Co-bearing samples. Yellow opaque decorations are rich in Pb and Sb, while only Sb is present in the white and light blue ones. This is consistent with the results of the X-ray powder diffraction analyses, that confirmed the presence of <b>lead</b> <b>antimonates</b> in the yellow decorations and of calcium antimonates in white and light blue ones. No crystalline phases were detected in dark blue, black and violet bulk glass...|$|R
40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to the {{characterization}} ofa suite of very rare, highly decorated and coloured glass vesselsand beads from the VII to the IV century BC. The most seriousdifficulty in developing this study was that any sampling –even micro-sampling – was absolutely forbidden. As a consequence,themineralogical and chemical nature of chromophoresand opacifiers present in these Iron Age finds were identifiedby means of the following synchrotron-based, strictly nondestructive,techniques: micro X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF),FeK-edge micro X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (μ-XANES) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). The μ-XRFmapping evidenced high levels of Pb and Sb in the yellow decorationsand the presence of only Sb in the white and light-blueones. Purple and black glass show high amounts of Mn andFe, respectively. The XRPD analyses confirmed the presenceof <b>lead</b> and calcium <b>antimonates</b> in yellow, turquoise and whitedecorations. FeK-edge μ-XANES spectra were collected in differentcoloured parts of the finds, thus enabling the mapping ofthe oxidation state of these elements across the samples. In mostof the samples iron is present in the reduced form Fe 2 + in thebulk glass of the vessels, and in the oxidized form Fe 3 + in thedecorations, indicating that these glass artefacts were producedin at least two distinct processing steps under different furnaceconditions...|$|R

Moreover, the mixture of calcium antimonate and <b>lead</b> <b>antimonate</b> were used as opacifier in the green glaze. In addition, green, turquoise, blue, and orange colors were achieved by the dissolution of copper, cobalt, and iron-bearing materials in an alkali glaze. A black glazed line, whose color was obtained by copper and iron oxides, was used to separate the colored glazes.

40|$|Three {{types of}} antimony-based, opaque ceramic colours {{were used in}} the faience {{workshop}} of Le Bois d'Épense during {{the first decades of the}} 19 th century; that is, yellow, tawny and green. Yellow is generated by <b>lead</b> <b>antimonate</b> crystals (Naples Yellow), which are incorporated into an uncoloured glass matrix. According to SEM–EDS measurements, these pigments contain iron. The tawny colour is the optical result of the combined presence of similar yellow, iron-bearing <b>lead</b> <b>antimonate</b> particles in a Fe-rich, brownish glass matrix. The green opaque colour is produced by the combination of a blue cobalt glass and yellow Pb–Sn–Fe-antimonate crystals.

40|$|For {{the first}} time, 18 th-century glass mosaics from the Capela de São João Baptista (Chapel of St. John the Baptist, Lisbon) were {{analysed}} by Raman microscopy (RM). This masterpiece in baroque mosaic art {{had one of}} its major contributors the most famous glassmaker in Rome, Alessio Mattioli. Mattioli was celebrated because of the opacity of his mosaics and the astonishing number of hues {{he was able to}} produce for mosaic decorating Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. This study had two goals in mind: (1) characterising the materials involved in the manufacture of these glass mosaics and (2) lengthening the understanding of what was left of Mattioli's glassmaking records. As expected the mosaics presented a high ratio of crystalline phases, making RM the ideal technique for non-destructive analysis. The mosaics contained a white ‘background’ or opacifier added identified as Ca 2 Sb 2 O 7.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the origin, supply pattern and {{production}} technology of Byzantine glass mosaic tesserae. In this study, we have analysed forty-eight glass tesserae from Sagalassos (Asia Minor) of different colours and from two archaeological contexts that were stratigraphically dated to the sixth century CE. The main aim was to identify the raw materials, colourants and opacifiers as well as secondary working practices that are reflected in the composition (EPMA, LA-ICP-MS analyses) and the microstructure (XRD, SEM-BSE) of the tesserae. The set of samples retrieved from the Roman Baths complex at Sagalassos is compositionally very homogeneous, representing possibly a single commission, and can be tentatively dated to the late Roman period. In contrast, the assemblage associated with the construction of a Byzantine church {{around the turn of the}} sixth century CE is more diverse, suggesting that these tesserae were produced from more than one silica source. This highlights a diversification in the supply and manufacture of glass tesserae during the Byzantine period. Although all analysed samples are natron-type soda-lime-silica glasses, a strong correlation between MgO, K 2 O, P 2 O 5 and CaO was observed, pointing to the contamination of the glass batch through fuel ash either intentionally in case of the red tesserae or accidentally as regards the green, peacock and white samples. The degree of contamination reflects differences in the duration of the secondary production stage according to the colour, which is also evidenced by the shapes and sizes of the opacifying crystals present in the opaque tesserae. X-ray diffraction measurements identified calcium antimonate (in the blue, peacock and white tesserae) and <b>lead</b> <b>antimonate</b> (green and yellow) as the main opacifying agents. The morphological analysis suggests that the calcium antimonate particles crystallised in situ, whereas a <b>lead</b> <b>antimonate</b> pigment was synthesised prior to its addition to the glass melt. Taken together, the compositional and microstructural characteristics clearly demonstrate different production processes that are related to the colours of the tesserae, thus indicating colour-specific secondary workshop practice...|$|E

30|$|The glaze studied {{turned out}} to be a very {{complicated}} system. In order to unveil the secrets of its production we used a set of analytical methods. The morphology of the interface layer together with the composition of the glassy matrix and ceramic body clearly show that the glaze was applied on the dried clay body and fired in the kiln at one step at the temperature less than 1000  °C, but certainly more than 800  °C. The silica–lead glaze applied on the ceramic tile was colored with copper and iron ions and opacified/colored using the artificially prepared pigments—white (cassiterite SnO 2 melted with PbO before adding to the glass), yellow (mixture of Naples yellow and lead tin oxide type I), copper filings (most probably in the form of oxides as burnt copper). The originally added yellow and white pigments were transformed into new phases, such as Sb-doped tin oxide (Sn 0.5 Sb 0.5 O 2) or monimolite (Pb 3 (SbO 4) 2). Tin-opacified glazes have a long history. We observed some similarities between Malbork’s glaze with Zaragoza glazes from 11 th c. (Si/Pb ratio) and also with Italian maiolica (Si/Pb ratio, copper oxide and <b>lead</b> <b>antimonate</b> mixture). The technologies used confirmed the medieval origin of the green glazed tiles.|$|E

The scientific investigation was performed on fragments detached from seven maiolicas attributed to the Castelli production (Abruzzi region) and one majolica from the Ascoli Piceno production (Marche region). The Castelli artifacts (late sixteenth–early eighteenth century) belong to the decorated style known as ‘‘compendiario. ’’ The piece from Ascoli Piceno recalls the decoration style of the other considered objects and is attributable to the ‘‘Paci’’ manufacture (first half of the nineteenth century). The selected objects were investigated by fiber optics reflectance spectroscopy, micro-X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy coupled with electron-dispersive X-ray spectrometry. The ceramic bodies of all objects are calcareous, whereas the glazes are lead-alkali type opacified by tin dioxide. Blue and purplishred decorations were obtained by cobalt and manganese compounds dissolved in the glaze, respectively. Yellow and orange decorations were obtained by particles of <b>lead</b> <b>antimonate</b> and hematite. Finally, black decorations were obtained using compounds rich in manganese and iron. The study contributes to knowledge on the production of Castelli ceramics and presents first archaeometric data on the maiolica production from Ascoli Piceno.

40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} results of archaeometric {{characterisation}} of the opaque tesserae, intentionally coloured with antimony- or phosphorus-based opacifiers, coming {{from one of the}} two only palaeo- Christian glass mosaics known in the Veneto region (Italy), i. e., the mosaic which decorated the votive chapel of St. Prosdocimus in Padova. In particular, 55 tesserae belonging to glass types “White”, “Blue”, “Yellow”, “Green” and “Brown” are examined here. The multi-methodological approach (SEM-EDS, EMPA, XRPD, imaging spectroscopy coupled, in some cases, with XAS) gave valuable insights into the complexities of palaeo-Christian glass mosaic production technologies. Two main groups are identified, one characterised by glassy matrixes and opacifiers (calcium or <b>lead</b> <b>antimonate)</b> typical of the Roman period and comprising all “White”, “Blue”, and “Yellow” tesserae and some “Green” ones, and the other characterised by glassy matrixes and an opacifier (calcium phosphate) typical of the 6 th century AD, composed of “Green” and “Brown” tesserae. This suggests that, during that century there was a gradual change from older to “new” production technologies: although new opacifiers such as calcium phosphate started to be used, the frequent use of antimony-based ones (43 / 55 samples) supports the hypothesis that their systematic use was extended until the 6 th century, although re-using old tesserae cannot be completely excluded. In addition, comparisons with compositional groups already identified in the “gold” tesserae of the same mosaic and tesserae from Ravenna demonstrate that both the same “base compositions” of the glass were used to produce transparent and opaque glass. This evidence, coupled with {{the results of}} the historical-artistic study, suggests technological connections between Padova and Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine mosaics in Italy. Micro-structural observations and chemical analyses of the Paduan antimonybased opacified glass demonstrate that different processes and raw materials were used in their production. Both in situ and ex situ crystallisation can be identified for calcium and <b>lead</b> <b>antimonate</b> in Paduan tesserae, whereas the production of tesserae opacified with calcium phosphate generally appears to be highly standardised. Although the opacifiers used in the Paduan tesserae support technological transitions, the colouring elements identified here, i. e., iron and manganese for white, yellow, brown and some green tesserae, cobalt for blue, and copper for blue and green, suggest continuity, because their use is widely testified in the production of both transparent and opaque glass artefacts dating from the Bronze Age until Medieval times, from whichever archaeological site the samples come. Peculiar relationships among the oxidation states of colouring elements, their contents in the glassy matrix, the types of opacifiers used, and the final colour of tesserae were identified. In addition, the correlations of cobalt and/or copper with other elements, together with identification of relics of colouring and “metallic” droplets, allow us to speculate on possible sources and production technologies. Lastly, identification of newly formed crystalline inclusions in tesserae also yields information on kiln temperatures, which ranged between 900 and 1150 °C, a range easily reached in the furnaces of the 6 th century AD...|$|E

Results for the transparent samples show that they are all silica-soda-lime glasses. Most of them, independently of colour, have compositions close to those of typical Roman glass, produced with natron as flux. No relationships were identified among chemical compositions, types or production techniques, but a dependence on bulk composition was identified for some particular colours, revealing the careful and intentional selection of raw materials. This is the case of Sb-colourless glass, produced with sand of high purity, a group of intensely coloured objects, mainly emerald green and black, produced with soda ash as flux, and some blue examples produced with various sources of sand or soda ash as flux. Two main types of opacifiers were identified for the opaque samples: calcium antimonate for white, mauve and blue glasses, and <b>lead</b> <b>antimonate</b> for the yellow ones; in one case, a yellow lead-tin antimonate was also identified. As regards the opaque glasses, most of the samples opacified with calcium antimonate are silica-soda-lime in composition, similar to the typical Roman glass. Instead, samples opacified with lead and/or lead-tin antimonates are lead glasses, suggesting different production technologies...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} laser {{cleaning}} of soiled natural stone surfaces possibly with unde rlying polychromy was studied {{by means of}} laboratory samples and during the cleaning of a Gothic tympanum at St Martins Church in Brunswick, Germany. Paint layers with pigments (1) frequently encountered in historic polychromies and (2) applied with different binders to cardboard strips and stone tablets (and subse quently coated with an artificial black gypsum crust) were irradiated. Laser light at different wavelengths and fluences was used to (a) determine fluence thre shold values for pigment alteration, and (b) {{to determine if the}} artificial gyps um crust can be ablated from the paint layers without discolouring them. The wavelength-dependent diffuse reflection and scattering of light were measured for the chosen pigment/binding medium combinations and turned into absorption coefficients according to the KubelkaMunk theory. These data served as a basis for theoretical considerations about the laserpigment interaction with respect to less critical wavelength regimes. For the pigments under investigation, the following sequence in order of sensitivity to laser irradiation from highest to lowe st was found: vermilion, massicot, <b>lead</b> <b>antimonate</b> (Naples yellow), minium, malachite, red ochre, yellow ochre, azurite, smalt, green earth. In the case of mal achite, azurite, minium, and vermilion, the chemical reaction which brings about the colour change was deduced from the X-ray diffraction curves of irradiated and altered pigment powders. Observations made during trial laser cleanings in the laboratory and on-site suggest that historic polychromies are more endanger ed by the loss of pigment flakes than by discoloration. The role that the binding medium and ageing effects play in the interaction of the laser with polychromies must be the subject of further investigations...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{a total of}} 114 glazed decorations of 42 ceramic floor tiles, {{manufactured}} in Sicily fromthe 16 th to 19 the 21 th AD, were investigated. The micro sampling method, proposed by us, using a cotton swab soaked in hydrofluoric acid, includes advantages of high sensitivity, high selectivity, simplicity, speed, not expensive and can be considered non-destructive because the point of sampling remains invisible to the human eye. ICP-OES technique {{was used in this}} study. Twenty-four elements (Al, As, B, Be, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Si, Sn, Ti, V and Zn) were determined in each colored enamel. Enameled decorations in Sicilian tiles were varied in tones and chromatic effects, obtained with a limited 25 number compounds of cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, tin, and in the artifacts following the year 1920, also titanium. An important remark {{is that some of the}} colors, such as black, orange, purple and brown were prepared using the same metals, while white, light blue, blue and green were obtained with different elements. The adoption of different recipes for the same color suggests the presence of several laboratories of ceramists working in Sicily who had preferences for different methods for the production of their enameled artifacts. Concerning the opacifier, the high amounts of lead and antimony, only in a case, indicate the use of <b>lead</b> <b>antimonate</b> (Pb 2 Sb 2 O 7). Black decorations were present in several of the analyzed samples and in most of them were identified mixtures of black iron and manganese oxides. The green decorations appear to have been prepared with copper oxide; lighter hue samples contained additional amounts of zinc and/ or barium compounds. Considering all the samples, meanly, iron predominates in yellow decorations, only a sample contains large amounts of Cd, Zn and very little Sb, which suggests the use of the pigments ZnO as white) and CdS as cadmium yellow. For all samples, except one, we can exclude the use of pigments containing chromium...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{preparation}} of yellow pigments (lead-tin yellow type I and II, lead antimoniate yellow and lead-tin-antimony yellow), which are affected by terminological confusion in the historical references. Through the centuries, yellows of different compositions, based on lead, tin and antimony, have been used either as agents that turn glasses, glazes and majolica opaque or as paint-pigments. Some types of yellow pigments were described in written sources. These sources are very hard to discover because production methods and formulas of artistic compounds were handed down to new generations in oral way. Sometimes, they were collected in secret books of pigments. In addition, artists and writers, during the utilization and production of lead-tin-antimony yellows, introduced some changes both in recipes and terminologies. All this produced great confusion in the nomenclature that changes the country tradition and, sometimes, for the writer’s inaccuracies. By analyzing the various recipes concerning lead-tin-antimony yellows, {{it was possible to}} reconstruct the original production methods of these pigments. We produced lead-tin yellow type I (Pb 2 SnO 4) and lead-tin yellow type II (PbSnO 3 or PbSn 1 -x SixO 3) following the indication of the recipes 272 and 273 of the fifteenth century Bolognese Manuscript, <b>lead</b> <b>antimonate</b> yellow, called Napoli yellow, according to the treatises written by Piccolpasso, Passeri and Mariano from Pesaro, and lead-tin-antimony yellow from the Darduin, Mariani da Pesaro and other recipes authors. The production of lead-tin-antimony based yellow pigments was obtained by pure chemicals oxides (PbO, Pb 3 O 4, SnO 2 and Sb 2 O 3). In synthesizing the yellow pigments, the effects produced by changes in stoichiometric ratios, in melting temperatures and in the crucible typologies were tested. The obtained products were characterized by SEM-EDS, XRD and micro-Raman analyses. To evaluate colour changes due to different melting temperatures and stoichiometric ratios, the colour measurements were taken in CIE 1931 and CIE 1976 coordinates. The results are analysed and discussed in terms of correlations among chemical compositions, melting conditions and colour hue. The study of these pigments, produced in laboratory with the ancient procedure, is also useful for investigations on similar materials used in the works of art. Indeed, it is very probable that the artists chose their painting materials by selecting not only the colour hue of the pigments but also the production method. Therefore, it is important to state a correlation between chemical compositions, ancient production methods, and the final colour hue of the produced yellow pigments...|$|E
