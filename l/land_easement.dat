40|$|The {{literature}} on optimizing conservation selection traditionally {{assumes that the}} conservation agency makes selections based on a single funding source. However, {{the reality is that}} conservation groups often piece together their selections by combining funds from multiple sources. This paper shows that, when conservation programs apply multiple-??knapsack optimization (also referred to as simultaneous binary integer programming), substantial increases in social benefits, acreage, and number of parcels preserved can be achieved. In particular, we show that applying a simultaneous optimization model can generate substantially greater benefits than three other approaches: benefit targeting, cost-??effectiveness analysis, and sequential optimization. By applying these four methods to data collected from 118 <b>land</b> <b>easement</b> applications in Baltimore County, Maryland, for 2007 through 2009, we show that simultaneous binary integer programming provides greater conservation benefits and preserves more acres of land. This study is the first to use data collected from an ongoing conservation program to quantify the increase in benefits of using a simultaneous optimization approach to achieve truly cost-effective conservation.

30|$|In the Maasai steppe, key {{habitats}} {{such as the}} Simanjiro plains are partially {{protected by}} traditional dry season grazing reserves. For example, Terrat village, which holds {{about one-third of the}} Simanjiro plains within its village land boundaries, traditionally allows livestock onto the plains from July up until around January (Nelson et al. 2010). In January, if rain has fallen, wildebeest usually begin calving on the plains, and livestock move away until the dry season grazing period begins again in July (approximately). To the west and southwest, Loiborserrit and Emboreet villages situate their dry season grazing reserves along the eastern border of Tarangire National Park, in an area that provides extensive habitat for buffalo, elephant, and other large mammals moving {{back and forth across the}} unseen park boundary. As in Loliondo, these local customary land management practices serve to conserve a large expanse of wildlife habitat adjacent to the park, effectively extending the area conserved and preventing the encroachment of agriculture against the park boundary. During the last 20 years, these traditional designations have been reinforced by a range of formal local governance and conservation measures, including local land use plans and by-laws, community tourism concession agreements with private operators, and, in Terrat village, a unique <b>land</b> <b>easement</b> agreement which pays the village to maintain their portion of the Simanjiro plains as dry season grazing reserve and to formally prohibit agriculture (Sachedina and Nelson 2010).|$|E

30|$|Our {{main results}} are {{provided}} in Table  2.

These results probably represent a tradeoff between population and land resources, and then provide an incentive to define land rights or to provoke the disputes (Buoye, 2000).|$|R

As such he {{introduced}} legislation to raise {{the price of the}} Federal Duck Stamp by $10 to $25, bringing the stamp in line with inflation as an increase had not occurred for many years. The purpose of the legislation was to preserve habitat in critical migratory waterfowl flyways to allow duck populations to grow. The legislation was supported by hunting groups, including Ducks Unlimited, the National Rifle Association, and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. The Fleming Duck Stamp bill passed the House and Senate by voice vote and was signed into law by President Obama on December 18, 2014, as it had broad bipartisan support. Hunters and conservationists liked it as it generated more revenue to preserve habitat for waterfowl. Conservatives supported it because all additional revenues were dedicated to <b>land</b> <b>easements</b> rather than federalizing private land.|$|R
