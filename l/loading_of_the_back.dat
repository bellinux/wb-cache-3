40|$|A {{prospective}} experimental study. To {{investigate the}} potential of serum keratan sulfate (KS) {{as an indicator of}} biochemical changes in intervertebral discs induced by physical <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> By providing objective information on exposure and effects at the tissue level, biomarkers may enable us to improve our understanding of the intermediate steps between exposure to physical loading and the occurrence of back disorders. Serum KS has been proposed as a potential biomarker of the molecular changes in intervertebral discs that occur because of physical loading and are a potential cause of back disorders. Thirty-two nonimpaired men volunteers {{with a mean age of}} 22. 5 +/- 2. 3 years participated in the experimental condition, a manual lifting task, as well as in the control condition, lying on the back. Serum KS levels were measured immediately before and after both conditions, as well as 24 hours and 1 week later. No significant changes in serum KS levels were found after exposure to physical loading (mean SD serum KS before, 287. 4 +/- 83. 9 ng/mL; immediately after, 279. 5 +/- 65. 5 ng/mL; 24 hours after, 266. 6 +/- 71. 9 ng/mL; and 1 week after, 268. 9 +/- 79. 3 ng/mL), and no significant changes were found after lying on the back for 8 hours (mean+/-SD serum KS before, 273. 0 +/- 94. 3 ng/mL; immediately after, 261. 6 +/- 68. 9 ng/mL; 24 hours after, 277. 3 +/- 68. 9 ng/mL; and 1 week after, 274. 5 +/- 68. 5 ng/mL).

40|$|In-shoe loading {{patterns}} {{were examined in}} each foot (back and front) separately during two types of tennis serve [first (or flat) and second (or twist) serve] and two service stance styles [foot-up (back foot is moved forward next to front foot for push-off) and foot-back (feet remain at the same relative level) ]. Ten competitive tennis players completed five trials {{for each type of}} serve and service stance style in random order. Plantar pressure distribution was recorded using Pedar insoles divided into nine areas for analysis. Mean and peak pressures (+ 15. 2 %, P < 0. 01 and + 12. 8 %, P < 0. 05) as well as maximal forces (+ 20. 2 %, P < 0. 01) were higher under the lateral forefoot of the front foot in first than in second serves, while mean forces were higher (+ 17. 2 %, P < 0. 05) under the lesser toes. Relative load was higher on the lateral forefoot (+ 20. 4 %, P < 0. 05) but lower (- 32. 5 %, P < 0. 05) on the medial heel of the front foot with foot-up compared with foot-back stance. Using a foot-up stance, <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> foot was higher (+ 31. 8 %, P < 0. 01) under the lateral mid-foot but lower (- 29. 9 %, P < 0. 01) under the medial forefoot.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{determinants of}} peak trabecular bone density, we studied {{the role of}} androgens, estrogen, and aerobic exercise in 30 women from 18 to 22 years old. The women were divided into three groups: Sedentary, 11 normal women who did not exercise regularly; eumenorrheic, 10 athletes with normal menstrual function; and oligomenorrheic, 9 athletes with exercise-induced oligomenorrhea. All athletes participated in aerobic sports that did not involve selective resistance <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> Serum free and albumin-bound testosterone (fab T), androstenedione (A), and estradiol (E 2) were measured on four separate occasions at consecutive 7 day intervals and averaged. Trabecular density was measured by quantitative computed tomography of the lumbar spine. Peak trabecular bone density was related to fab T (r = 0. 48, p = 0. 007), A (r = 0. 40, p = 0. 03), and E 2 (r = 0. 40, p = 0. 04). When taken in combination, androgens and estrogen each accounted independently for significant portions {{of the variance in}} bone density [fab T and E 2 (R 2 = 0. 38, p = 0. 002) and A and E 2 (R 2 = 0. 27, p = 0. 01) ]. Bone density (mg/ml, mean +/- standard error of the mean, SEM) in the sedentary group (174 +/- 6) was not significantly different from that in the eumenorrheic (183 +/- 12, p = 0. 47) or oligomenorrheic (161 +/- 11, p = 0. 32) subjects. We conclude that androgens and estrogen function as independent and additive determinants of peak trabecular bone density in young women. The quantitative impact of aerobic exercise (without resistance loading) and exercise-induced menstrual dysfunction appears to be less important than that of the hormones...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{epidemiological}} {{studies show that}} pushing and pulling increase <b>the</b> risks <b>of</b> shoulder complaints and not necessarily of low <b>back</b> complaints. Moreover, <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exerted hand forces during pushing and pulling is poorly related to <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanical <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low <b>back</b> and <b>the</b> shoulder. In light of that, this paper combines results of several studies to present an approach for evaluating not only the exerted hand forces, but also <b>the</b> low <b>back</b> and shoulder load during pushing and pulling in practice. The approach specifies, based on scientific evidence, that (1) in order to validly obtain exposure (frequency and duration) to pushing and pulling, 10 workers should be observed during eight periods of 30 min; (2) how the exerted hand forces and <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low <b>back</b> and shoulder can be estimated in practice based solemnly on <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object, one-handed or two-handed pushing or pulling, and <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> handle; and finally, (3) how these outcomes can be evaluated in combination with existing guidelines regarding exerted hand forces, compression forces on <b>the</b> low <b>back</b> and <b>the</b> moments at the shoulder.

40|$|Asymmetric lifting is {{associated}} with an increased risk of low back disorders. Especially in lifting movements, characterized by a small amount of asymmetry, it is still the question if asymmetric lumbosacral torques occur, or if subjects try to avoid asymmetric back loading by twisting their pelvis with respect to the feet. An increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lifting speed or the box weight might amplify the lumbar torques but might also result in an attempt to limit further increase of asymmetric torques by increasing pelvic twist. In the current study, asymmetrical lifting movements were analyzed with <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> a 3 D linked segment model, using cuffs mounted to the body segments. Eight subjects performed lifting movements with five different asymmetry conditions, ranging from 0 to 90 °lifting asymmetry with respect to the sagittal plane, using two lifting speeds and two box weights. A significant increase in lateral flexing and twisting low back torque was found for each increase in asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lifting movement. Pelvic twist accounted more or less constantly for about 25 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lifting asymmetry and was hardly influenced by lifting speed or box weight. Even for 10 or 30 °of lifting asymmetry, subjects did not twist their pelvis far enough to avoid asymmetric <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low <b>back.</b> Assuming that asymmetric <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low <b>back</b> is more strenuous to the spine than symmetric loading, the current results indicate that even small deviations of a lifting movement from the sagittal plane can explain an increased risk of low back disorders...|$|R

40|$|Sudden, {{unexpected}} loading on <b>the</b> low <b>back</b> {{is associated}} with a high incidence of low back pain. Experiments in which sudden loading was applied during standing revealed increased compression forces on the spine and increased trunk angle, which may cause injury to the spine and hence explain this association. During a more dynamic daily activity, i. e. lifting, this could not be demonstrated, which may be due to experimental constraints. We therefore reinvestigated <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low <b>back</b> when subjects were lifting an unexpectedly heavy object. Ten males lifted boxes, weighing 1. 6 or 6. 6 kg, at a self-selected lifting velocity. In some trials <b>the</b> mass <b>of</b> these boxes was unexpectedly increased by 10 kg. The ground reaction forces, body movements and trunk muscle activity were measured and from these, the L 5 /S 1 torques and compression forces were estimated. Underestimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mass did not lead to an increase in low back loading. This finding was independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mass the subjects were expecting to lift. In conclusion, no evidence was found to support inference regarding causality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> association between sudden loading and low back pain during whole body lifting movements.

40|$|Reason for {{performing}} study: During trot, the rider call either {{rise from the}} saddle during every stride or remain seated. Rising trot is used frequently because it is widely assumed that it decreases <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equine <b>back.</b> This has, however, not been demonstrated in an objective study. Objective: To determine <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> rising and sitting trot on <b>the</b> movements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horse. Hypothesis: Sitting trot has more extending effect on <b>the</b> horse's <b>back</b> than rising trot and also results in a higher head and neck position. Methods: Twelve horses and one rider were used. Kinematic data were captured at trot during over ground locomotion under 3 conditions: unloaded, rising trot and sitting trot. Back movements were calculated using a previously described method with a correction for trunk position. Head-neck position was expressed as extension and flexion of 0, C 3 and C 6, and vertical displacement of C 1 and the bit. Results: Sitting trot had an overall extending effect on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> horses {{when compared to the}} unloaded situation. In rising trot: <b>the</b> maximal flexion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> was similar to the unloaded situation, while the maximal extension was similar to sitting trot; lateral bending <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> was larger than during the unloaded situation and sitting trot; and the horses held their heads lower than in the other conditions. <b>The</b> angle <b>of</b> C 6 was more flexed in rising than in sitting trot. Conclusions and clinical relevance: <b>The</b> <b>back</b> movement during rising trot showed characteristics of both sitting trot and the unloaded condition.

40|$|Lifting is {{a common}} task that many people face every day. Some jobs, like manual garbage collecting, require {{considerably}} more frequent lifting. Heavy weight, improper posture and repetition can apply excessive forces to different body parts, especially on <b>the</b> lower <b>back,</b> which is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most affected parts during lifting. The current study focuses on infrequent, symmetric lifting. A box, weight 2, 60, or 130 N, is picked {{up from the floor}} and lifted to different heights using either knee or hip lifting.

To {{get a more}} detailed knowledge concerning the risk factor {{in the health care}} sector, the working postures and <b>the</b> mechanical <b>load</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low <b>back</b> were measured during nine commonly used patient handling tasks. Further the variation in the load between the different tasks was compared with the variation between subjects when they perform the same tasks. The study includes 10 female nurses with no special education or course in patient handling technique and a male stroke patient. The load during the different tasks were quantified from the net moment at L 4 iL 5 joint calculated by use of a 3 D biomechanical dynamic multi-segment model, the measured muscle activity (EMG) in erector spinae muscles and <b>the</b> kinematics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low <b>back.</b> Significant differences in the mean values for all the dependent variable both between tasks and between subjects were found.

40|$|Mechanical <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low <b>back</b> during lifting is {{a common}} cause of low back pain. In this study two-handed lifting is {{compared}} to one-handed lifting (with and without supporting the upper body with the free hand) while lifting over an obstacle. A 3 -D linked segment model was combined with an EMG-assisted trunk muscle model to quantify kinematics and joint loads at the L 5 S 1 joint. Peak total net moments (i. e., the net moment effect of all muscles and soft tissue spanning the joint) {{were found to be}} 10 ± 3 % lower in unsupported one-handed lifting compared to two-handed lifting, and 30 ± 8 % lower in supported compared to unsupported one-handed lifting. L 5 S 1 joint forces also showed reductions, but not <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same magnitude (18 ± 8 % and 15 ± 10 %, respectively, for compression forces, and 15 ± 17 % and 11 ± 14 % respectively, for shear forces). Those reductions <b>of</b> low back <b>load</b> were mainly caused by a reduction <b>of</b> trunk and <b>load</b> moment arms relative to the L 5 S 1 joint during peak loading, and, in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> hand support, by a support force of about 250 N. Stretching one leg backward did not further reduce low back load estimates. Furthermore, one-handed lifting caused an 6 ± 8 ° increase in lateral flexion, a 9 ± 5 ° increase in twist and a 6 ± 6 ° decrease in flexion. Support with the free hand caused a small further increase in lumbar twisting. It is concluded that one-handed lifting, especially with hand support, reduces L 5 S 1 loading but increases asymmetry in movements and moments about the lumbar spine. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Olson Continuous <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low <b>back</b> tissues {{results in}} {{modified}} neuromuscular and kinetic output during trunk extension efforts. It {{is believed that}} <b>the</b> viscoelastic behavior <b>of</b> these low back tissues is modified, but <b>the</b> ramifications <b>of</b> these <b>loading</b> schemes needs further study for longer durations. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this research project was to observe force output and muscle activation pattern changes during trunk extension efforts before and up to 60 minutes after passive cyclic <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lumbar spine during trunk flexion-extension exercise. Sixteen healthy male and female volunteers (20. 3 ± 2. 1 yrs, 1. 63 ± 0. 04 m, 50. 2 ± 9. 3 kg) participated in the study. An isokinetic dynamometer was used in performing a 10 min set of cyclic trunk flexion-extension at a preset velocity of 0. 17 rad/s through each participant’s range of trunk flexion from seated upright position. Participants performed maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) trunk extension efforts before, immediately after, and at 15 minute intervals (T 15 – T 60) for 60 min after cessation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passive <b>loading</b> scheme. Maximum and average torque output, as well as surface electromyography (EMG) from thoracic (TP) lumbar paraspinal (LP), rectus abdominis (RA) and external oblique (EO) muscles (bilaterally), were recorded. One way ANOVAs were used to identify changes at each time period of testing compared to baseline values. Alpha was set at 3 ̆c 0. 05. Maximum and average torque measures did not change over time (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). Rate of force development did not change over time (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). Average EMG did not change over time (p 3 ̆e 0. 05) in TP,LP and RA muscles. There was significant difference across time for the LEO muscle (p 3 ̆c 0. 04). Average EMG at T 15 and T 30 were {{significantly lower than the}} initial pre-loading values. Similarly, a significant difference was present in the right EO over time (p 3 ̆c 0. 01). Average EMG values at T 15, T 30 and T 45 were significantly lower than at the initial pre-loading values. All peak EMG data during recovery were significantly reduced compared to the initial value all (p 0. 05) Range of motion did not significantly change from pre to post trials. These data provide inconclusive results as to the force output and EMG modifications when the passive viscoelastic tissues are cyclically loaded in flexion-extension.
