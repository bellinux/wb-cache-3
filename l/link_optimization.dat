Ericsson is using its own multi-core system (EMCA) for various high performance mobile network systems. EMCA, like most embedded multiprocessor systems, is a memory constrained system. Each core has limited amount of local and shared memory for code and data. To achieve high computational density on the system, it is very important to optimize code size to reduce both shared memory access and context switching costs for each computation node.

The objective of this work is to provide an insight {{on the development of the}} wireless machine to machine (M 2 M) application, and a systematic approach for improving the application reliability on radio link level by end users. As a specific case, ABB Robotics’ Remote Service concept is examined to check whether the selection of cellular technology as its wireless access method and the choice of standard radio link components are able to satisfy the application requirement under different circumstances. Several modifications of the radio link components and topologies, e. g. repeater system, combiner, etc, are proposed for the enhancement of radio link reliability. Theoretical evaluations of these options are based on detailed radio link calculation and MATLAB simulation using propagation model dedicated for industrial environment. Furthermore, on site test is carried out to validate the theoretical evaluations. The M 2 M market investigation is also included in the task, in order to select the most cost-effective components from different suppliers. While walking through the radio <b>link</b> <b>optimization</b> process of the specific case, necessary information and knowledge common to all wireless M 2 M application are explained.
