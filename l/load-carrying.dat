5|$|The Blackburn Firebrand was a British {{single-engine}} strike fighter for the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy designed during World War II by Blackburn Aircraft. Originally {{intended to}} serve as a pure fighter, its unimpressive performance and the allocation of its Napier Sabre piston engine by the Ministry of Aircraft Production for the Hawker Typhoon caused it to be redesigned as a strike fighter to take advantage of its <b>load-carrying</b> capability. Development was slow and the first production aircraft was not delivered until {{after the end of the}} war. Only a few hundred were built before it was withdrawn from front-line service in 1953.|$|E
25|$|For this, some pads are {{inserted}} into or under all major <b>load-carrying</b> {{elements in the}} base of the building which should substantially decouple a superstructure from its substructure resting on a shaking ground.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, U.K. cyclists {{began to}} shift from road-only {{bicycles}} to all-terrain models such as the mountain bike. The mountain bike's sturdy frame and <b>load-carrying</b> ability gave it additional versatility as a utility bike, usurping the role previously filled by the roadster. By 1990, the roadster was almost dead; while annual U.K. bicycle sales reached an all-time record of 2.8 million, {{almost all of them}} were mountain and road/sport models.|$|E
25|$|The Marine Corps {{eventually}} {{concluded that}} both the RON, and the competing Hiller ROE were too heavy and too difficult to fly and abandoned the project. The United States Navy, however, had noticed the compact size and high <b>load-carrying</b> capacity of the RON, and in 1960 awarded a contract to Gyrodyne to produce a radio-controlled drone version of the Rotorcycle, {{to be used as}} an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) platform. Using the dynamic components of the RON, this was eventually developed as the Gyrodyne QH-50.|$|E
25|$|Royal Mail {{is famous}} for its custom <b>load-carrying</b> {{bicycles}} (with the rack and basket built into the frame), made by Pashley Cycles since 1971. Since 2000, old delivery bicycles have been shipped to Africa by the charity Re~Cycle; over 8,000 had been donated by 2004. In 2009, Royal Mail announced it was beginning to phase out bicycle deliveries, to be replaced with more push-trolleys and vans. A spokesman said that they would continue to use bicycles on some rural routes, {{and that there was no}} plan to phase out bicycles completely.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, bicycle designs have trended towards {{increased}} specialization, as {{the number}} of casual, recreational and commuter cyclists has grown. For these groups, the industry responded with the hybrid bicycle, sometimes marketed as a city bike, cross bike, or commuter bike. Hybrid bicycles combine elements of road racing and mountain bikes, though the term is applied {{to a wide variety of}} bicycle types. Hybrid bicycles and commuter bicycles can range from fast and light racing-type bicycles with flat bars and other minimal concessions to casual use, to wider-tired bikes designed for primarily for comfort, <b>load-carrying,</b> and increased versatility over a range of different road surfaces. Enclosed hub gears have become popular again - now with up to 8, 11 or 14 gears - for such bicycles due to ease of maintenance and improved technology.|$|E
25|$|When a {{structure}} {{is subjected to}} compressive stress, buckling may occur. Buckling {{is characterized by a}} sudden sideways deflection of a structural member. This may occur even though the stresses that develop in the structure are well below those needed to cause failure of the material of which the structure is composed. As an applied load is increased on a member, such as a column, it will ultimately become large enough to cause the member to become unstable and it is said to have buckled. Further loading will cause significant and somewhat unpredictable deformations, possibly leading to complete loss of the member's <b>load-carrying</b> capacity. If the deformations that occur after buckling do not cause the complete collapse of that member, the member will continue to support the load that caused it to buckle. If the buckled member {{is part of a larger}} assemblage of components such as a building, any load applied to the buckled part of the structure beyond that which caused the member to buckle will be redistributed within the structure.|$|E
25|$|On 5 August 2008, two {{pilots and}} seven firefighters {{assigned}} to the Iron Complex fire in California's Shasta-Trinity National Forest, were killed when Carson Helicopters S-61N N612AZ crashed on takeoff. Of the 13 people reportedly on board, one other pilot and three firefighters survived the crash with serious or critical injuries. The NTSB determined that the probable causes were the following actions by Carson Helicopters: 1) the intentional understatement of the helicopter’s empty weight, 2) the alteration of the power available chart to exaggerate lift capability, and 3) the use of unapproved above-minimum specification torque in performance calculations that, collectively, resulted in the pilots’ relying on performance calculations that significantly overestimated <b>load-carrying</b> capacity and without an adequate performance margin for a successful takeoff; and insufficient oversight by the U.S. Forest Service and the Federal Aviation Administration. Contributing factors were the flight crew's failure to address {{the fact that the}} helicopter had approached its maximum performance capability on two prior departures from the accident site as they were accustomed to operating at its performance limit. Contributing to the fatalities were the immediate, intense fire due to a fuel spillage upon impact from the fuel tanks that were not crash-resistant, the separation from the floor of the cabin seats that were not crash-resistant, and the use of an inappropriate release mechanism on the seat restraints.|$|E
500|$|The Latin epithet onustusa means [...] "charged, <b>load-carrying,</b> burdened", and {{a regular}} {{adjective}} derived from onus, [...] "burden" [...] (the same word that gave the English [...] ). A.onusta {{is commonly known as}} the [...] "loaded Lepidella", or the [...] "gunpowder Lepidella".|$|E
500|$|Gonsales's <b>load-carrying</b> {{birds have}} also left their mark. The Oxford English Dictionarys entry for gansa reads [...] "One {{of the birds}} (called {{elsewhere}} 'wild swans') which drew Domingo Gonsales to the Moon in the romance by Bp. F. Godwin". For the etymology it suggests ganzæ, found in Philemon Holland's 1601 translation of Pliny the Elders Natural History. Michael van Langren ("Langrenus"), the 17th-century Dutch astronomer and cartographer, {{named one of the}} lunar craters for them, Gansii, later renamed Halley.|$|E
500|$|The fixed {{armament}} of four [...] T-31 autocannon {{was fitted}} {{in the center}} section, adjacent to the outer wing panels with 200 rounds per gun. A centerline hardpoint {{and a pair of}} outer hardpoints were installed on the center section and rated to take bombs, fuel tanks or torpedoes up to [...] in weight. The outer hardpoints could also carry an AN/APS-4 search radar in a pod. A dozen hardpoints could be installed on the outer wing panels to carry [...] bombs or [...] high velocity aircraft rockets. In service, the Mauler earned the nickname [...] "Able Mable" [...] because of its remarkable <b>load-carrying</b> ability, once lifting [...] of ordnance (three [...] torpedoes, a dozen 250-pound bombs plus its 20mm guns and their ammunition) on 30 March 1949, perhaps the heaviest load ever carried by a single-engine, piston-powered aircraft.|$|E
500|$|The Germans also {{continued}} to supply second-line aircraft to the ZNDH, including between nine and 12 exotic Fieseler Fi 167 biplane torpedo bombers. These had been originally designed and {{intended for use}} aboard the German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin, which was never completed. After that they were sold to the NDH, where their short-field and <b>load-carrying</b> abilities made them ideal not only for attack missions, but also for transporting ammunition and other supplies to besieged army garrisons. Many of these missions were flown between their arrival in September 1944 {{and the end of}} the War (under the right conditions, the aircraft could descend almost vertically). During one such mission, near Sisak on 10 October 1944, an Fi 167 of the ZNDH [...] was attacked by five P-51 Mustang Mk IIIs of 213 Squadron RAF. The crew of the Fieseler (piloted by an ex-HZL eight-kill Flying ace), exploiting the aircraft's extreme maneuverability to the fullest, had the distinction of shooting down one of the Mustangs before itself being shot down; possibly one of the last biplane [...] "kills" [...] of the war.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of [...] "light cars", a tax {{was placed on the}} size of these vehicles called the Light Motor Vehicle Tax. The amount charged for the size of [...] "passenger cars" [...] (the largest of the three classifications recognized in Japan) is ¥29,500, with passenger cars and trucks with a <b>load-carrying</b> capacity of 1,000kg or more at ¥13,200. The car tax on [...] "light cars" [...] below 1,000 cc is ¥7,200, or ¥4,000 for commercial vehicles (some local governments may charge more based on local regulations).|$|E
2500|$|Alternative names include haversack {{from the}} German Hafersack meaning [...] "oat sack", (which more {{properly}} describes a small cloth bag on a strap worn {{over one shoulder}} and originally referred to the bag of oats carried as horse fodder), Kraxe (a German rucksack with a rigid framework), and bergen (a large <b>load-carrying</b> rucksack, from a design issued by the British Army during the Second World War). In fact, Britons used to call Alpine-style backpacks [...] "Bergen rucksacks", maybe from {{the name of their}} creator, Norwegian Ole F. Bergan, combined with the name of the Norwegian city of Bergen.|$|E
2500|$|When the UK {{canceled}} its {{order for}} the F-111K in 1968, components for the 48 F-111Ks in manufacturing were diverted to FB-111A production. The FB-111A featured longer F-111B wings for greater range and <b>load-carrying</b> ability. [...] The bomber variant had a redesigned aft fuselage and its maximum speed was limited to Mach 2. Its fuel capacity was increased by 585 gallons (2,214 L) and it used stronger landing gear {{to compensate for the}} higher maximum takeoff weight of 119,250lb (54,105kg). All but the first aircraft had the Triple Plow II intakes and the TF30-P-7 with 12,500lbf (56kN) dry and 20,350lbf (90kN) afterburning thrust.|$|E
2500|$|In the UK and Japan, the {{standard}} wheels are 19inch alloy wheels (...) with [...] (eXtraLoad) high performance tyres. [...] This 19" [...] wheel and tyre package was {{an option for}} the North American, and some European markets. [...] Factory supplied tyres included Continental SportContact 3, Michelin Pilot Sport PS2, or Pirelli P-Zero Rosso — although many owners have questioned the <b>load-carrying</b> abilities of the Pirellis (from unexplained sidewall failures and dubious dynamic stability), opting for the more durable Michelins at replacement time. [...] A no-cost option of 18inch alloy wheels (...) with [...] tyres was also available, and these are standard in North American markets. [...] A winter wheel and tire package was also available as an option, and included [...] Dunlop SP WinterSport 3D tyres.|$|E
2500|$|The 1948 car {{featured}} radial tyres, {{which had}} just been commercialised; front-wheel drive; {{rack and pinion steering}} mounted inside the front suspension cross-tube, away from a frontal impact; rear fender skirts (the suspension design allowed wheel changes without removing the skirts); bolt-on detachable front and rear wings; detachable doors, bonnet (and boot lid after 1960), by [...] "slide out" [...] P-profile sheet metal hinges; flap-up windows, as roll up windows were considered too heavy and expensive.; and detachable full length fabric sunroof and boot lid, for almost pickup-like <b>load-carrying</b> versatility. Ventilation in addition to the sunroof and front flap windows was provided by an opening flap under the windscreen. The car had load adjustable headlights and a heater (heaters were standardised on British economy cars in the 1960s).|$|E
2500|$|On 7 May 1942 Hitler ordered {{development}} of a simple, low-speed, half-track, <b>load-carrying</b> vehicle for use on the Eastern Front. Büssing-NAG was selected {{to develop a new}} [...] tractor (Zgkw. 5t neuer Art) to replace the earlier 5 tonne Sd.Kfz. 6 and [...] Sd.Kfz. 11 half-tracks, as well as the various lesser-known vehicles of the same class. Production started in December 1943 at Büssing-NAG. Early examples used a truck-like, unarmored cabin similar to the earlier half-tracks it replaced, while later examples featured an armored cabin and engine compartment that looked similar to the Sd.Kfz. 251 armored personnel carrier. Like the earlier Demag-designed Sd.Kfz. 10, the sWS's suspension system consisted of five double roadwheels per side, overlapping and interleaved in the [...] layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. One idler wheel, mounted at the rear end of each track unit, was used to control track tension.|$|E
2500|$|DNC paratroopers wore {{dark blue}} {{fatigues}} (other sources {{described it as}} black), whose cut followed closely that of the US Army OG-107 jungle utilities, to distinguish them {{from the rest of}} the Royal Lao Armed Forces (FAR). [...] Service headgear consisted on a badgeless black beret worn American-style, pulled to the right – in contrast to the FAR, where berets were still being worn pulled to the left in typical French fashion – reflecting the influence of the training cadres received from the Thai PARU in 1962; in the field, the beret was often replaced by a US M-1C jump helmet. Regulation footwear were the calf-length French M1950 or M1950/53 TAP (French: Bottes de saut modéle 1950 et 1950/53) black leather jump-boot models and the US Army M-1962 [...] "McNamara" [...] black leather combat boots. Web gear was a mix of US M-1945 and M-1956 <b>Load-Carrying</b> Equipments (LBE), respectively in khaki and Olive Green cotton canvas and standard issue in the FAR.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the course}} of the war, the UH-1 went through several upgrades. The UH-1A, B, and C models (short fuselage, Bell 204) and the UH-1D and H models (stretched-fuselage, Bell 205) each had {{improved}} performance and <b>load-carrying</b> capabilities. The UH-1B and C performed the gunship, and some of the transport, duties {{in the early years of}} the Vietnam War. UH-1B/C gunships were replaced by the new AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter from 1967 to late 1968. [...] The increasing intensity and sophistication of NVA anti-aircraft defenses made continued use of UH-1 gunships impractical, and after Vietnam the Cobra was adopted as the Army's main attack helicopter. [...] Devotees of the UH-1 in the gunship role cite its ability to act as an impromptu Dustoff if the need arose, as well as the superior observational capabilities of the larger Huey cockpit, which allowed return fire from door gunners to the rear and sides of the aircraft. In air cavalry troops (i.e., companies) UH-1s were combined with infantry scouts, OH-6 and OH-58 aero-scout helicopters, and AH-1 attack helicopters to form several color-coded teams (viz., blue, white, red, purple, and pink) to perform various reconnaissance, security, and [...] "economy of force" [...] missions in fulfilling the traditional cavalry battlefield role.|$|E
50|$|Modernized <b>Load-Carrying</b> Equipment, {{also known}} as M-1967 Modernized <b>Load-Carrying</b> Equipment or MLCE, was {{introduced}} into United States Army service in 1968 during the Vietnam War. The M-1967 MLCE was not specifically designed to replace the canvas and cotton duck M-1956 <b>Load-Carrying</b> Equipment (which was the then-current United States Army <b>load-carrying</b> system), but instead it was designed for use in tropical environments.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of this lightweight rucksack led to an informal inquiry by officers of the infantry community as {{to the possibility of}} reducing the weight of the M-1956 <b>Load-Carrying</b> Equipment (LCE). As a result of this interest, the army produced a set of LCE in 1962, substituting available nylon materials for the cotton canvas duck. This set of nylon <b>load-carrying</b> equipment weighed slightly more than 3 lb as opposed to 5 lb for the cotton canvas duck items. These two items, the lightweight rucksack and the set of nylon LCE, formed the basis for that portion of the LINCLOE Quantitative Material Requirement dealing with <b>load-carrying</b> equipment. Annex A to the Quantitative Material Requirement set a goal of 3.3 lb for the individual <b>load-carrying</b> equipment and 3 lb for the rucksack. Officials decided that the design of the new <b>load-carrying</b> equipment would follow that of the standard <b>load-carrying</b> equipment with material changes from cotton canvas duck to nylon duck and replacement of the brass and steel hardware with aluminum or plastic items.|$|E
50|$|Testing of {{this new}} <b>load-carrying</b> system, known as the LINCLOE <b>Load-Carrying</b> Equipment (LCE), began in July 1969 at Fort Benning; September 1969 at Fort Clayton; October 1969 at Fort Greely; and November 1969 at Fort Lee.|$|E
50|$|Even {{after the}} {{adoption}} of the MLCE in 1967, developments continued under the LINCLOE program. The MLCE was envisioned for use strictly in tropical environments {{and the development of a}} standard <b>load-carrying</b> equipment system to replace all <b>load-carrying</b> equipment systems continued.|$|E
50|$|Modern wiring methods assume {{two or more}} <b>load-carrying</b> {{conductors}} {{will lie}} very near each other, as for instance in standard NM-2 cable. Since the <b>load-carrying</b> wires are in proximity, when they heat up, the heating is shared across the wires, limiting the overall current load they can support. Since the <b>load-carrying</b> wires in K&T wiring are widely spaced, the wires can carry higher currents than the same conductors in proximity. When installed correctly, the K&T wires are held away from the structural materials by ceramic insulators.|$|E

The M-1956 LCE came at a period when the United States Army {{was in the process of}} adopting a new service rifle, and thus the system is very general-purpose in nature, designed to accommodate ammunition and cartridge magazines for a number of standard issue small arms.
