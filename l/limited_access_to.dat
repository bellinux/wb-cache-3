5|$|The {{development}} of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> education, poverty amongst women, inequalities {{and human rights}} abuses.

Most of the funding for the sport in Africa comes from FIFA, not from national football federations.|$|E

5|$|Portugal's wars against {{independence}} guerrilla {{fighters in}} its 400-year-old African territories began in 1961 with Angola. In Mozambique, the conflict erupted in 1964 {{as a result}} of unrest and frustration amongst many indigenous Mozambican populations, who perceived foreign rule to be a form of exploitation and mistreatment, which served only to further Portuguese economic interests in the region. Many Mozambicans also resented Portugal's policies towards indigenous people, which resulted in discrimination, traditional lifestyle turning difficult for many Africans, and <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Portuguese-style education and skilled employment.|$|E

5|$|The Burundi women's {{national}} football team represents Burundi in women's inter{{national football}} competitions. The team, however, has not competed in a match recognised by FIFA, the sport's international governing body.

Further development of football in the country faces challenges found across Africa, including inequality and <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> education for women.

5|$|The {{development}} of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> education, poverty amongst {{women in the}} wider society, and fundamental inequality present in that society that occasionally allows for female-specific human rights abuses.

5|$|The {{development}} of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> education, poverty amongst women, inequalities {{and human rights}} abuses targeting women.

5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power because they have <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> education, formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E
5|$|Following {{complaints}} from local media over <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Goldschmidt's public papers stored at the Oregon Historical Society (OHS), the state archivist announced May 29 that Goldschmidt would seize the 256 boxes of documents to guarantee public access {{as defined in}} a state law passed in 1973. That law required that public access to such records be maintained, but did not specify where the records be kept. Following Goldschmidt's decision to put the documents {{in the care of}} the OHS, the state legislature passed a law requiring future governors to leave their documents in the state archives. Many records were published on the state archives' Web site in early 2005.|$|E

40|$|Abstract * This review {{analyzes}} a body {{of research}} conducted by Lester and his colleagues {{in the last ten years}} on the effects of <b>limiting</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> lethal methods for suicide and for homicide. Results provide evidence that <b>limiting</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a preferred method of committing suicide and homicide has a preventive effect, more clearly so for suicide than for homicide. However, there was also evidence that some switching of method may take place after <b>limiting</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> one method, again more clearly for suicide than for homicide. However, the body of research as a whole indicates that this line of investigation may prove fruitful in the future for documenting the impact of restricting <b>access</b> <b>to</b> lethal implements in the prevention of crime, and of other social and public health problems...|$|R
5|$|Hyde Park {{was created}} for hunting by Henry Vlll in 1536 after he {{acquired}} the manor of Hyde from the Abbey. It was enclosed as a deer park and remained a private hunting ground until James I permitted <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> gentlefolk, appointing a ranger to take charge. Charles I created the Ring (north of the present Serpentine boathouses), and in 1637 he opened the park to the general public. It quickly became a popular gathering place, particularly for May Day celebrations. At {{the start of the}} English Civil War in 1642, a series of fortifications were built along {{the east side of the}} park, including forts at what is now Marble Arch, Mount Street and Hyde Park Corner. The latter included a strongpoint where visitors to London could be checked and vetted.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Watts {{settled in}} Durham, N.C. with his wife, Constance Merrick Watts, {{a native of}} the town. He opened a private clinic in general surgery for poor people and African Americans, as blacks had very <b>limited</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> medical services. In 1965, he was the chief of surgery at the Lincoln Hospital, {{which was one of the}} city's few {{hospitals}} to serve blacks. The hospital consisted of 150 beds. The hospital was also one of the few hospitals in America at that time which allow African American doctors to perform surgery. While working as chief of surgery Watts also served as a trainer for the hospital's interns. In the 1970s he played a major role in establishing the Lincoln Community Health Center.|$|E
5|$|The country became {{independent}} in 1977. Fédération Djiboutienne de Football {{was founded in}} 1977 and joined FIFA in 1994. Football {{is one of the}} most popular sports in the country.

When high level women's players are developed, many leave the country seeking greater opportunity in Northern Europe or the United States. Another issue facing women's football in Africa is that most of the money for the game does not come from national football federations but instead from FIFA.|$|E
