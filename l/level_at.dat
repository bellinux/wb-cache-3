40|$|Introduction: Plasma imatinib levels {{vary widely}} in {{patients}} with the chronic myeloid leukemia-chronic phase, and studies have shown improved hematological, cytogenetic, and molecular responses {{in patients with}} the higher trough imatinib levels. Materials and Methods: We analyzed 50 consecutive patients with the chronic myeloid leukemia-chronic phase and performed plasma imatinib <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> 1 month and 12 months and correlated them with complete hematological response at 3 months and molecular response at 12 months, respectively. Results: Trough plasma imatinib <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> 1 month correlated well with complete hematological response at 3 months (P = 0. 007) and <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> 12 months correlated with molecular response at 12 months (P = 0. 04). Compliance to imatinib also significantly correlated with imatinib <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> 1 month (P = 0. 0008) and imatinib <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> 12 months (P = 0. 0002). Conclusion: Plasma imatinib levels may be of benefit in patients not achieving desired response at defined time intervals. The plasma level monitoring also helps {{in the assessment of}} drug compliance...|$|R
