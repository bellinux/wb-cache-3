[...] Bill Lamb of About.com praised the song, and called it [...] "the most instantly engaging song from the album Rated R", and that [...] " [...] projects a dominant female image {{that is exactly what}} was needed to move past the unfortunate Chris Brown chapter in her career".

Bell also explains that Elle {{is one of the few}} characters with abilities that embrace their power and is almost on the verge of being addicted to her ability. Elle [...] "enjoys the emotional power it gives her over other people". She is described as one who is [...] "always out to get what she wants" [...] and someone who [...] "doesn’t have many boundaries".

Edmonton Journal Sandra Sperounes wrote that on [...] "No Love Allowed" [...] Rihanna plays with the Barbadian accent on {{the same way she}} did on her 2005 debut single [...] "Pon de Replay". According to a reviewer of Billboard, Rihanna's cry to the love police in the song, can be heard in the lines, [...] "Broken heart was the case / go'on and put him away / He's the only one one one / I let get the best of me." [...] BBC Music's Natalie Shaw wrote that some of the song's lyrics like [...] "Like a bullet your love hit me to the core / I was flying ‘til you knocked me to the floor", are uncomfortably balanced between true love and awkward acrimony. According to Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly, the up stated lines [...] "doesn’t sound <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> forgiven" [...] Chris Brown for the 2009 domestic violence case.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, Body Language received an average score of 62 based on 17 reviews {{which indicates that}} the album received [...] "generally favourable reviews". Chris True from AllMusic complimented Minogue for expanding her [...] "horizons" [...] and felt that the album was consistent {{and worked as a}} [...] "piece", calling it [...] "stylish without being smarmy, retro without being ironic". He favoured the overall production of the album and praised Minogue for displaying a [...] "sense of class", which he felt was lacking in the work of female artists like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Madonna; he concluded by labelling Body Language a [...] "near perfect pop record" [...] and [...] "what may well be the best album of her [...] career". Keith Caulfield from Billboard was also positive in his review and complimented Minogue for selecting a talented creative team, saying [...] "The sexy, solid set is glued together by danceable beats and Minogue's knack for picking great songs and producers." [...] The Irish Times review of the song called the album a [...] "worthy successor to 2001's smash hit Fever, a supremely danceable collection of electro-pop songs that's clearly in thrall to the 80s" [...] and complimented Minogue's versatile vocal delivery. Ethan Brown from New York was greatly impressed by opening track [...] "Slow", and commented that most of the songs on the album [...] "mimic its sound, none of the other songs on Body Language comes close to the achievement of [...] "Slow"". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt Body Language was a better album than Fever, calling it [...] "less immediate and more experimental, a midway point between the alternative/electronica of 1997's Impossible Princess and Minogue's more mainstream post-millennium work", and praised it for being cohesive. He also complimented Minogue's [...] "willingness to try something new – even if it's within the confines of dance-pop – is what's made her an international sensation 15 years running". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone favoured the sensual nature of the album, calling it [...] "fantastic" [...] and that [...] "At thirty-five, she's ten times hotter than she was ten years ago – on Body Language, Kylie Minogue definitely sounds <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a few more tricks stored on her hard drive than Britney [...] or Christina [...] ".|$|E

In an interview with Davina McCall shortly afterwards, Goody said she was [...] "disgusted with self" [...] after seeing a video of the alleged bullying. Her much-publicised return to the Big Brother house was called [...] "a terrible decision" [...] by publicist Max Clifford: [...] "It looks <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> ruined a very lucrative career". At this time Goody was a supporter of the anti-bullying charity Act Against Bullying, which dropped her.

On February 8, 2015, during his Grammy Awards red carpet interview, American rapper Kanye West announced, that he will be the executive producer of Anti.

However, in January 2016, in a Twitter reply message to a fan, Rihanna wrote that West is no longer executive producer of the album and both of them are working on different projects. Instead, Rihanna served as the executive producer of Anti and worked with several producers.|$|E

Big Boi told his friend Sean Combs about Monáe, whom at the time Combs had not yet heard. Combs soon visited Monáe's MySpace page and according to a HitQuarters interview with Bad Boy Records A person Daniel 'Skid' Mitchell, Combs loved it straight away: [...] " [...] loved her look, loved that you couldn't see her body, loved {{the way she was}} dancing, and just loved the vibe. He felt <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> something that was different – something new and fresh." [...] Monáe signed to Bad Boy in 2006. The label's chief role was in facilitating her exposure on a much broader scale rather than developing the artist and her music, because in the words of Mitchell, [...] "She was already moving, she already had her records – she had a self-contained movement." [...] Combs and Big Boi wanted to take their time and build her profile organically and allow the music to grow rather than put out [...] "a hot single which everyone jumps on, and then they fade because it's just something of the moment".|$|E
2500|$|On February 8, {{during his}} Grammy Awards red carpet interview, West {{explained}} how the collaboration came to fruition: [...] "I'm {{executive producer of}} Rihanna's album, and I said I'd done a few songs with Paul McCartney and she couldn't get past this record. She had to have it on her album... So now we at the Grammys doing it". West further compared Rihanna's vocals on the song to that of Scottish singer Annie Lennox: [...] "I feel <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> this type of energy in her vocals. And she even brought it to another level of like soul and heart and artistry". In an interview with V magazine, Rihanna revealed, [...] "The thing that made me {{fall in love with}} [...] is the juxtaposition of the music and the lyrics. When you read the lyrics it's a completely different song than what you are hearing. The music is easygoing, but the lyrical content is very loud and in your face." [...] Although it is a first collaboration by the trio, they have collaborated separately. West and McCartney collaborated on the 2014 single [...] "Only One", a track dedicated to West's daughter North. Rihanna and West previously collaborated on Jay-Z's 2009 single [...] "Run This Town" [...] — which became a commercial success and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart — and West's 2011 single [...] "All of the Lights", a track featuring backup vocals by John Legend, Fergie, and Elton John among others.|$|E
2500|$|Kahlo's {{paintings}} often feature root imagery {{with roots}} {{growing out of}} her body to tie her to the ground, reflecting in a positive sense the theme of personal growth; in a negative sense of being trapped in a particular place, time and situation; and finally in an ambiguous sense of how memories of the past influence the present for either good and/or ill. In My Grandparents and I, Kahlo painted herself as a ten-year holding a ribbon that grows from an ancient tree that bears the portraits of her grandparents and other ancestors while her left foot is a tree trunk growing out of the ground, reflecting Kahlo's view of humanity's unity with the earth, and her own sense of unity with Mexico itself. In Kahlo's paintings, trees serve as symbols of hope, of strength and of a continuity that transcends generations. Additionally, hair features {{as a symbol of}} growth and of the feminine in Kahlo's paintings and in Self Portrait with Cropped Hair, Kahlo painted herself wearing a man's suit and shorn of her long hair, which she had just cut off. Kahlo holds the scissors with one hand menacingly close to her genitals, which can be interpreted as a threat to Rivera whose frequent unfaithfulness infuriated her and/or a threat to harm her own body just <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> attacked her own hair, a sign of the way that women often project their fury against others onto themselves. Moreover, the picture reflects Kahlo's frustration not only with Rivera, but also her unease with the patriarchal values of Mexico as the scissors serve as a symbol of a malevolent sense of masculinity that threatens to [...] "cut up" [...] women, both metaphorically and literally. In Mexico, the traditional Spanish values of machismo were widely embraced, and as a woman, Kahlo was always uncomfortable with machismo.|$|E

Lynsey can not rest as she is thinking about the challenge, she is losing sleep and she has already lost her friends over her claims. It {{is a lot to}} have [...] "resting on her shoulders - she knows that somebody's life is in her hands. Lynsey tries to stand up to Silas, but he outwits her at every turn". At her [...] "lowest ebb", Lynsey confides in Doug Carter (PJ Brennan) whose girlfriend, Jenny (Daisy Turner), was killed by Silas. Hassan {{explained that}} Lynsey takes a big risk in confiding in Doug but Lynsey trusts him to keep it a secret. Lynsey feels like she should not be bringing Doug in to the dangerous situation but she realises that she needs someone to help her. Her portrayer went on to add that Doug believes Lynsey and shows her a lot of kindness and friendship. Lynsey is given clues by Silas to help her identify his next victim, although they leave Lynsey feeling <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> no way of figuring the potential victim's identity out as the clues seem to fit everyone. Hassan said that by the time Halloween arrives Lynsey feels [...] "totally tired and exhausted". Silas reveals that Lynsey is the woman he intended to kill but she escapes. Silas kills a woman dressed as Catwoman, initially believing it to be Lynsey until he realises it is his daughter, Heidi Costello (Kim Tiddy). Lynsey soon after exposes Silas who is arrested. Hassan said that she had enjoyed seeing Lynsey show gumption during the storyline and hoped to see more of this side of her character. Reflecting on the storyline, Hassan said the storyline was amazing and added that she was enthusiastic to play the storyline. She said that previous to the storyline she had known she could show a feistier side and more depth to Lynsey which she was always aware existed.|$|E

Speaking on This Morning, Fox said she was stopped in the street by people who praised the storyline as being true to life which she said was [...] "overwhelming". Dawson felt the storyline was being [...] "very true to life" [...] as the scenes are [...] "what people go through. It's nice that they're holding onto that and it doesn't just end there.

2500|$|In season 4, Peyton {{discovers that}} she has a {{half-brother}} named Derek. With prompting from Lucas, she agrees to meet with him. However, unknown to Peyton and everyone else, the guy she meets is not her half-brother but rather an Internet stalker who is the owner of the WATCHMEWATCHU emails and has been taking pictures of her, listening to her podcast, watching her on her webcam, and even {{going so far as to}} get a tattoo of Ellie's drawing of her on his back, making a prostitute dress like Peyton before they have sex. Unaware of all this, and in an attempt to be more trusting, Peyton accepts him. Lucas, on the other hand, soon grows suspicious of this 'Derek' when he catches him sniffing Peyton's hair during a hug and finds Peyton's jacket, which had gone missing, on the beaten prostitute still dressed as Peyton. Peyton soon realizes the truth, and, in a terrifying encounter, is manhandled and nearly raped by Psycho Derek. Lucas and the real Derek come to her rescue, pushing him out a window; by the time the police show up, he has disappeared. This series of events causes Peyton to withdraw from society, becoming scared and even skipping school and getting four locks on her bedroom door. Derek, who is in the Marine Corps and is unwilling to care too deeply due to having watched too many loved ones die, avoids Peyton until Lucas comes and talks to him about her. He and Peyton develop a healthy sibling relationship and he helps her come to terms with her fear, not only of Derek but of confessing her feelings to Lucas. Peyton is unwilling to ruin the friendship that she and Lucas have, especially until she is sure that he and Brooke are over. At Derek's encouragement, she asks Lucas to a banquet to honor Whitey, only to find out he is going with Brooke. Disappointed, she takes Derek instead. Derek tells her that he is being deployed to Iraq. That night, Lucas comes over to Peyton's to tell her that it is finally over between him and Brooke. She immediately confesses that she is in love with him, to which Lucas just says [...] "Oh." [...] It is not until after winning the state championship that Lucas realizes that it has always been Peyton he wants. Lucas declares Peyton his girlfriend, but their happiness is short-lived when Lucas has a heart attack that same night and almost dies. Peyton fears she will lose him <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> lost everyone else. However, Lucas [...] "comes back to the living" [...] for Peyton, and to tell her he loves her. She and Lucas soon decide to just be happy. They decide to make love, for the first time, during a party in the room where Peyton first rejected him, but they are interrupted when Peyton hears everyone cat-calling at what she thinks is a sex tape of her and Nathan. When Lucas and Peyton rush out to put an end to the tape, they, and everyone else, discover that it is in fact, of Nathan and Brooke. Peyton is enraged at Brooke and punches her, giving her a black eye.|$|E
