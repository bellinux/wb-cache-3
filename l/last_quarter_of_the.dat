5|$|Alexander and {{his paper}} vocally {{supported}} the old governing {{class of the}} former Confederate States of America and were rabid in {{their opposition to the}} policies of Reconstruction imposed upon the South by the Northern-based Republican Party. Such views were {{out of step with the}} majority of Oregonians, however, with the Republicans coming to dominate Oregon politics during the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19thcentury. Alexander was forced to liquidate his stake in his money-losing newspaper in 1868.|$|E
5|$|Federal Reconstruction in Mobile {{began after}} the Civil War and {{effectively}} ended in 1874 {{when the local}} Democrats gained control of the city government. The <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century {{was a time of}} economic depression and municipal insolvency for Mobile. One example can be provided by the value of Mobile's exports during this period of depression. The value of exports leaving the city fell from $9 million in 1878 to $3million in 1882.|$|E
5|$|Mannerism is {{the name}} {{sometimes}} given to the period in art history during which the late Renaissance coexisted with the early Baroque, in Poland the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 16th century and {{the first quarter of}} the 17th century. Polish art remained influenced by the Italian centers, increasingly Rome, and increasingly by the art of the Netherlands. As a fusion of imported and local elements, it evolved into an original Polish form of the Baroque.|$|E

5|$|Martin Nyrop {{was one of}} {{the main}} proponents of the National Romantic style. The main aim was to use {{distinctive}} Nordic motifs from the distant past, as is clearly demonstrated in Copenhagen City Hall which was completed in 1905. The City Hall is certainly Copenhagen's most monumental and most original building from the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century with its impressive facade, the golden statue of Absalon just above the balcony and its tall, slim clock tower. It was inspired by the Siena City Hall.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{under the}} Aros settlement's defences indicate {{the site was}} a town {{as early as the}} <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 8thcentury, considerably earlier than had been generally supposed. Discoveries after a 2003 archaeological dig unearthed half-buried longhouses, firepits, glass pearls and a road dated to the late 700s. Archaeologists have conducted several excavations in the inner city since the 1960s revealing wells, streets, homes and workshops. In the buildings and adjoining archaeological layers, everyday utensils like combs, jewellery and basic multi-purpose tools from approximately the year 900 have been found.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{findings}} show human use of ivory to date {{back more than}} 35,000 years. It has been exported to Europe since at least Classical antiquity, but exporting accelerated during the Age of Exploration and colonisation of Africa. At its peak, {{at the end of}} the 19th century and early 20th century, with the rise of mass production, well over 1000 tons of ivory were exported to Europe yearly. In the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, the city of Sheffield, England alone imported 180 tons just for cutlery handles. In the 1970s, Japan became the largest consumer of ivory, accounting for about 40% of all trade worldwide, with Hong Kong acting as the largest trade hub.|$|E

5|$|Belief in the {{existence}} of water bulls persisted in Scotland until at least the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century. As with many mythological creatures, descriptions are imprecise. The water bull is able to shapeshift into human form, and live on land or in water. It can be a monstrous, malevolent black beast, especially when described as a tarbh uisge, but not as nasty as the each uisge or water horse. It can also be amiable and sometimes helpful. It differs from the Manx tarroo ushtey, which {{is more likely to be}} a resident of marshland.|$|E
5|$|During its rule, Spain quelled various {{indigenous}} revolts. There {{were also}} several external military challenges from Chinese and Japanese pirates, the Dutch, the English, the Portuguese and the Muslims of Southeast Asia. Those challengers were fought off despite the hostile forces having encircled the Philippine archipelago in a crescent formed from Japan to Indonesia. British forces occupied Manila from 1762 to 1764 in {{an extension of}} the fighting of the Seven Years' War. Spanish rule was restored following the 1763 Treaty of Paris. The Spanish–Moro conflict lasted for several hundred years. In the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, Spain conquered portions of Mindanao and the Moro Muslims in the Sulu Sultanate formally recognized Spanish sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th {{century the}} gardens and grounds were {{restored}} and replanted. The house and village have often featured as locations for films. Several {{scenes of the}} 1995 film version of Jane Austen's novel Sense and Sensibility were filmed at Montacute, as were scenes from the 2004 film The Libertine. The house was used as Baskerville Hall for a version of The Hound of the Baskervilles filmed in 2000 for Canadian television. In May–June 2014 the house was used {{as one of the}} locations for the BBC's adaption of Hilary Mantel novel Wolf Hall.|$|E
25|$|Leavitt's {{first love}} was {{mathematics}} and astronomy. Something of a pure scientist, Leavitt contributed scientific papers to societies until <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his life, often {{having to do}} with astronomy and physics. <b>The</b> annual conventions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Philosophical Society often heard presentations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latest <b>of</b> Leavitt's findings. Nor were Leavitt's <b>the</b> musings <b>of</b> some crackpot New Hampshire hermit. In an 1811 paper concerning astronomy addressed to the President and membership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Academy <b>of</b> Arts and Sciences, for instance, Leavitt outlined his New and short Method <b>of</b> calculating <b>the</b> times <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First and <b>Last</b> <b>Quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{a relationship}} between unemployment and crime. I test a hypothesis whether unemployment affects crime indirectly through an immediate negative opportunity effect and delayed positive motivation effect. <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> unemployment is analyzed in respect of 11 categories <b>of</b> crime. <b>The</b> analysis was performed using fixed effects on quarterly panel data for 14 regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic from <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> 2005 to <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> 2012. <b>The</b> negative opportunity effect and positive motivation effect proved to be statistically significant in <b>the</b> model <b>of</b> property crimes and total crime. However, size of both effects is very small...|$|R
50|$|The {{most extreme}} tidal range occurs when <b>the</b> {{gravitational}} forces <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> Sun and Moon are aligned (syzygy), reinforcing {{each other in}} the same direction moon or in opposite directions moon. This type of tide is known as a spring tide. During neap tides, when the Moon and Sun's gravitational force vectors act in quadrature (making a right angle to the Earth's orbit), the difference between high and low tides is smaller. Neap tides occur during <b>the</b> first and <b>last</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon's phases. The largest annual tidal range can be expected around <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equinox, if coincidental with a spring tide.|$|R
5|$|Ermanaric's great-nephew, Vinitharius, who disliked {{being under}} Hun rule, withdrew his forces and marched against the Antes {{in order to}} defeat them and to show his courage. This {{took place in the}} <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4th century, {{possibly}} around 380. Boz, the king of the Antes (rex Antorum), had organized an alliance to defend the Antes, and managed to defeat Vinitharius in their first encounters, however, Vinitharius fought valiantly and managed to capture and crucify Boz, together with his sons and 70 of his chiefs (primates). Vinitharius left their bodies hanging to induce fear in those who had surrendered. These conflicts constitute the only pre-6th century contacts between Germanics and Slavs documented in written sources.|$|E
5|$|From 1774 until 1858, Madras {{was a part}} of British India and {{was ruled}} by the British East India Company. The <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th century was a period of rapid expansion. Successful wars against Tipu Sultan (1782–99), Velu Thambi, Polygars and Ceylon added vast areas of land and contributed to the {{exponential}} growth of the Presidency. Newly conquered Ceylon formed part of the Madras Presidency between 1793 and 1798. The system of subsidiary alliances originated by Lord Wellesley as Governor-General of India (1798–1805) also brought many princely states into the area militarily subordinate to the Governor of Fort St George. The hill tracts of Ganjam and Visakhapatnam were the last places to be annexed by the British.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century heavy {{industry}} {{was replaced by}} service-based activities including data processing, call centres, hi-tech electronics and IT companies. The town retains some traditional industries employing people in paper-manufacturing, packaging, textiles, transportation, steel foundries and building materials. Missiles were produced at the British Aerospace (BAe) factory in Lostock, now closed. The Reebok brand's European headquarters are located at the Reebok Stadium. Bolton is also {{the home of the}} family bakery, Warburtons, established in 1876 on Blackburn Road. On 13 February 2003, Bolton was granted Fairtrade Town status.|$|E

5|$|In {{the twelfth}} century {{education}} in the Faroe Islands {{was provided by the}} Catholic Church. The Church of Denmark took over education after the Protestant Reformation. Modern educational institutions started operating in the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century and developed throughout the twentieth century. The status of the Faroese language in education was a significant issue for decades, until it was accepted as a language of instruction in 1938. Initially education was administered and regulated by Denmark. In 1979 responsibilities on educational issues started transferring to the Faroese authorities, a procedure which was completed in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Maibaum kept {{on making}} rewrites as filming progressed. Red Grant {{was added to}} the Istanbul scenes just prior to the film crew's trip to Turkey—a change that brought more focus to the SPECTRE plot, as Grant started saving Bond's life there (a late change during {{shooting}} involved Grant killing the bespectacled spy at Hagia Sophia instead of Bond, who ends up just finding the man dead). For the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movie, Maibaum added two chase scenes, with a helicopter and speedboats, and changed the location of Bond and Klebb's battle from Paris to Venice.|$|E
5|$|Many {{indigenous}} communities did not evenly {{share in the}} benefits of the economic boom Taiwan experienced during the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century. They often lacked satisfactory educational resources on their reservations, undermining their pursuit of marketable skills. The economic disparity between the village and urban schools resulted in imposing many social barriers on aborigines, which prevent many from moving beyond vocational training. Students transplanted into urban schools face adversity, including isolation, culture shock, and discrimination from their peers. The cultural impact of poverty and economic marginalization has led to an increase in alcoholism and prostitution among aborigines.|$|E
