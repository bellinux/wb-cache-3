It was a thought experiment that took {{on a life of}} its own." [...] Miller continued that at the time, he and Stentz thought they were writing Olivia-focused episodes, but [...] "In retrospect, we really wrote a four-part story about Walter, his relationship to children, and the struggle between Walter-who-was and Walter-who-is. If you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> his decision at the end of 'Northwest Passage' becomes the moment where he reconciles those things. He doesn't resolve them, but he comes to grips with them. Once again in retrospect, I think that's what the supermarket breakdown was really about. This happens — you think a scene is about one thing when you're in the middle of it, and realize it's something else entirely when you look back. Characters can be sneaky motherfuckers that way." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2008, NFL draft expert Mel Kiper Jr. named Ringer as {{the best}} back {{in the class of}} 2009. However, when Mel Kiper revised his 2009 draft choices in February 2009, Ringer was not listed among Kiper's top five running backs. It was {{revealed}} Ringer has been playing on a torn lateral meniscus, which he had surgery on six days after the season ended. Ringer has said he has worked out at the combine with his knee at [...] "80%". Ringer skipped the 2009 Senior Bowl because of his injury. Despite the injury, Ringer chose to participate in the 40-yard dash at the NFL combine. He clocked in at 4.59. Ringer was quoted as saying [...] "I personally was disappointed because I know I'm a lot faster than that. But I was able to do that just coming off knee surgery, so if I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> I'm happy." [...] He finished third among running backs in the 20-yard shuttle (4.11 seconds) and fifth in the three-cone drill (6.87 seconds). During the combine, Ringer said he interviewed with 12 teams. ESPN.com ranked him as the 8th best running back in the draft. When Scouts Inc. graded Ringer, they gave him a 1 (Exceptional) in Character. They said of Ringer, [...] "No off-the-field issues we are aware of. Coaches and teammates have only positive things to say about him. Outstanding intangibles." [...] Ringer was a projected 3rd Round pick. Another site lists him as a mid-second round draft choice. Ringer has drawn comparisons to NFL players Mike Hart and Chester Taylor. His strengths are listed as build, toughness, and patience, while his weaknesses are listed as height, breakaway speed, open field elusiveness, and injuries. A Dayton Daily News article states that Ringer is [...] "Still projected as a 2nd-rounder", despite the injury. The same article states that Ringer interviewed with the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals at the NFL combine.|$|E

60|$|And {{yet there}} is nothing at all {{wonderful}} in {{the appearance of the}} real boomerang.

60|$|Evidence of my {{literary}} success, if you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> {{may have}} lain in {{an invitation to}} dine at Andrew Carnegie's, but a suspicion that I was being patronized made me hesitate.

Certainly to be forever weary and worried, to be endlessly soiled with thankless labor and to grow old before one's time soured and disappointed, is not the whole destiny of man! ...|$|E

6000|$|My mother, {{like most}} of her neighbors, still cooked and served meals in our one living room during the winter but moved into a [...] "summer kitchen" [...] in April. This change always gave {{us a sense of}} luxury--which is pathetic, if you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Our front room became {{suddenly}} and happily a parlor, and was so treated. Mother at once got down the rag carpet and gave orders for us to shake out and bring in some clean straw to put under it, and when we had tacked it down and re-arranged the furniture, it was no longer a place for muddy boots and shirt-sleeved shiftlessness, it had an air of being in perpetual Sabbath leisure.|$|E

6000|$|At first I didn't understand--because Mr. Peters {{hesitated a}} good deal in telling me about it--that if Uncle gets this appointment, it will mean that he will sell things in the street.

So I was much surprised to find that when Uncle came in he didn't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> at all.

[...] And there was a little lead spoon with [...] "Souvenir of the Bowery" [...] that he made the second class. He started arranging and rearranging all the things in the box, just as he used to arrange the orders and decorations at the Palace. Only those were REAL things such as the Order of the Red Feather, and The Insignia of the Black Duck, and these were only poor tin baubles. But I could see that Uncle no longer knows the difference, and as his fingers fumbled among these silly things he was quite trembling and eager to begin, like a child waiting for to-morrow.|$|E
6000|$|DOOLITTLE. Don't say that, Governor. Don't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> What am I, Governors both? I ask you, what am I?

If there's anything going, and I put in {{for a bit of}} it, it's always the same story: [...] "You're undeserving; so you can't have it." [...] But my needs is as great as the most deserving widow's that ever got money out of six different charities in one week for the death of the same husband. I don't need less than a deserving man: I need more. I don't eat less hearty than him; and I drink a lot more. I want a bit of amusement, cause I'm a thinking man. I want cheerfulness and a song and a band when I feel low. Well, they charge me just the same for everything as they charge the deserving. What is middle class morality? Just an excuse for never giving me anything. Therefore, I ask you, as two gentlemen, not to play that game on me. I'm playing straight with you. I ain't pretending to be deserving. I'm undeserving; and I mean to go on being undeserving. I like it; and that's the truth. Will you take advantage of a man's nature to do him out of the price of his own daughter what he's brought up and fed and clothed by the sweat of his brow until she's growed big enough to be interesting to you two gentlemen?

She'd like scent of that kind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her, with a little {{jessamine}} mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Good conductor, is it? Or bad? Light too. Suppose there's some connection. For instance {{if you go into}} a cellar where it's dark. Mysterious thing too. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure. Suppose it's ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It's like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like {{what do you call it}} gossamer, and they're always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to everything she takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little kick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too. Reminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There or the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes and corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something. Muskrat. Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for years. Dogs at each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> We're the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period. Come near.
