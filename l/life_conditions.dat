Coleman overcame challenging <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> after being enrolled in youth wrestling classes. As a high school senior for Oak Park and River Forest High School finished third in the state wrestling championships. On several occasions, Coleman executed a takedown by jumping over his opponent and grabbing him as he flew over his back. Coleman is sometimes referred to as the Flying Squirrel for this takedown move that he has made famous.|$|E

To perform such a monitoring, a technique based on charge-based capacitance measurement has been developed, by which all DC, AC measurements and stress are implemented in sequence on a device. Measurement, stress and re-measurement are repeated on a logarithmic time sequence, and key parameters for the <b>life</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring are extracted from the measured curves. The degradation of the key parameters is characterized as a measure for the <b>life</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring. The technique is accurate, flexible and with lower cost...|$|R
40|$|Background Recent {{estimates}} of the number of children and young people with <b>life</b> limiting <b>conditions</b> derived from routine inpatient data are higher than earlier estimates using death record data. Aim To compare routine inpatient data and death records as means of identifying <b>life</b> limiting <b>conditions</b> in children and young people. Design Two national cohorts of children and young people with a <b>life</b> limiting <b>condition</b> (primary cohort from England with a comparator cohort from Scotland) were identified using linked routinely collected healthcare and administrative data. Participants 37563 children and young people with a <b>life</b> limiting <b>condition</b> in England who died between 1 April 2001 and 30 March 2015 and 2249 children and young people with a <b>life</b> limiting <b>condition</b> in Scotland who died between 1 April 2003 and 30 March 2014. Results In England, 16642 (57 %) non-neonatal cohort members had a <b>life</b> limiting <b>condition</b> recorded as the underlying cause of death; 3364 (12 %) had a <b>life</b> limiting <b>condition</b> -related condition recorded as the underlying cause and 3435 (12 %) had <b>life</b> limiting <b>conditions</b> recorded only among contributing causes. 5651 (19 %) non-neonates and 3443 (41 %) neonates had no indication of a <b>life</b> limiting <b>condition</b> recorded in their death records. Similar results were seen in Scotland (overall, 16 % had no indication of <b>life</b> limiting <b>conditions).</b> In both cohorts, the recording of <b>life</b> limiting <b>condition</b> was highest amongst those with haematology or oncology diagnoses and lowest for genitourinary and gastrointestinal diagnoses...|$|R

25|$|The kinetic {{process of}} destabilisation can be rather long (up to several {{months or even}} years for some products) and it is often {{required}} for the formulator to use further accelerating methods in order to reach reasonable development time for new product design. Thermal methods are the most commonly used and consists in increasing temperature to accelerate destabilisation (below critical temperatures of phase inversion or chemical degradation). Temperature affects not only the viscosity, but also interfacial tension in the case of non-ionic surfactants or more generally interactions forces inside the system. Storing a dispersion at high temperatures enables to simulate real <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> for a product (e.g. tube of sunscreen cream in a car in the summer), but also to accelerate destabilisation processes up to 200 times.|$|E

These new reguengo villages (royal villages under direct royal political and economical control, and administered by their autonomous city councils), each one usually known as a burgo due to its walled circuits, constituted important attraction points for peasants, who could find better <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> under the direct protection of the king than abroad {{under the authority of}} a bishop, a monastery or a nobleman; but they also attracted foreigners, most notably artisans and merchants, who brought new trends and knowledges. These burgs supposed a revolution in the social structure of the time, leading to economic diversification, removing the dominant autarky of the previous centuries, and facilitating the development of fishing and pre-industrial activities oriented toward the mass production of some resources, especially salted and dried fish, fish oil, and wine, marketed through the seaports north to England, and south to the Mediterranean.|$|E

The central government tried to reform the self-management system and create an open market economy with considerable state ownership of major industrial factories, but strikes in major plants and hyperinflation have held back progress.

2500|$|This was {{fiercely}} {{criticized by}} Marx and the Young Hegelians, {{who claimed that}} Hegel {{had gone too far}} in defending his abstract conception of [...] "absolute Reason" [...] and had failed to notice the [...] "real" [...] —i.e. undesirable and irrational— <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> of the working class. By turning Hegel's idealist dialectics upside-down, Marx advanced his own theory of dialectical materialism, arguing that [...] "it is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness." [...] Marx's theory follows a materialist conception of history and space, where the development of the productive forces is seen as the primary motive force for historical change, and according to which the social and material contradictions inherent to capitalism inevitably lead to its negation—thereby replacing capitalism with a new rational form of society: communism.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{important}} events succeeded {{such as the}} arrival of Abdelaziz Thâalbi from exile.

Likewise, Bourguiba had {{to keep up with}} his school work to keep his ranks and be selected. On 32 students who started their first year with him, only 14 passed the exam for their final year. Bourguiba, internal and scholarship owner, must be careful with the final year results even though he was far from being one of the studious. His wretched <b>life</b> <b>conditions</b> worsened with his brother's marriage to Memia Saheb Ettabaâ, daughter of a former minister. She wanted revenge on him for this misalliance with a poor family and made of his life a real hell. Even Bourguiba's entourage, full of wealthy beldis, were aware of social inequalities. In 1917, he failed his Arabic brevet which permitted him to access an administrative office. Despite his strictness and rigidity, the headmaster permitted him to remake the sixth and last year of high school in the 1919–1920 school year. But the cold of winter and junk food caused by deprivation on the initiative of the school headmaster who supported a War effort, worsened the boy's health. In addition, Bourguiba was hospitalized because of a primary infection, which led him to abandon high school and remain at the hospital. During the 1973 conference he held, he described that illness he had saying: [...] "The sixth year was the final one, the diploma year of deliverance.
