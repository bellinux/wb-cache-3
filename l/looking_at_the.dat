The way I would perform songs was always about the lyrics and always about trying to speak to everybody and make them watch and believe what I'm saying and I suppose I'm essentially doing that here but I'm not <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> audience I'm obviously <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> other actors.|$|E

5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared attention. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> object. Dyadic joint attention involves mutual gaze between the parent and infant. Mutual gaze is marked by both the parent and infant looking at each other's face. If two individuals are simply looking at an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.|$|E

5|$|Merrifield opens The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic by {{discussing}} how archaeologists have understood magic and ritual practices in past societies, opining {{that on the}} whole {{it had been a}} neglected area of study. <b>Looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> archaeological evidence for ritual activity in the pre-Roman Iron Age and the Roman Iron Age of Britain, he discusses animal and human sacrifice, as well as the offering of votive deposits in rivers and other bodies of water. He moves on to explore the rituals surrounding death and burial, suggesting areas where this ritual activity is visible in the burial record of multiple societies. Merrifield goes on to discuss the archaeological evidence for ritual practices in Christian Europe, highlighting areas of ritual continuance from earlier pagan periods, in particular the deposition of metal goods in water. <b>Looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> evidence for foundation deposits in European buildings that likely had magico-religious purposes, he then looks at several examples of written charms and spells which have survived in the archaeological record.|$|E
5|$|Methods of male {{birth control}} include condoms, vasectomies and withdrawal. Between 25 and 75% of males who are sexually active would use {{hormonal}} birth control {{if it was}} available for them. A number of hormonal and non-hormonal methods are in trials, {{and there is some}} research <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> possibility of contraceptive vaccines.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his career, and {{increasingly}} in later years, Richardson {{was known for}} his eccentric behaviour on and off stage. He was often seen as detached from conventional ways of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> world, and his acting was regularly described as poetic or magical.|$|E
5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared attention. For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint attention it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing their attention on each other. Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> object.|$|E
5|$|A quick cut later, the costumed {{character}} is <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camera again with hands at its sides. After {{a few more}} jump cuts in which they turn {{to the right and}} back again, the figure stands still, then looks to its left slowly. The figure looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the wall, with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E

5|$|According to legend, Murasaki {{retreated to}} Ishiyama-dera at Lake Biwa, {{where she was}} {{inspired}} to write The Tale of Genji on an August night while <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moon. Although scholars dismiss the factual basis {{of the story of}} her retreat, Japanese artists often depicted her at Ishiyama Temple staring at the moon for inspiration. She may have been commissioned to write the story and may have known an exiled courtier in a similar position to her hero Prince Genji. Murasaki would have distributed newly written chapters of Genji to friends who in turn would have re-copied them and passed them on. By this practice the story became known and she gained a reputation as an author.|$|E
5|$|Another {{brute force}} {{approach}} is to match up the frequency distribution of the letters. By graphing the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot {{the value of the}} shift by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> displacement of particular features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. For example, in the English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E
5|$|Another way of {{estimating}} {{the age of}} the cluster is by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lowest-mass objects. In normal main-sequence stars, lithium is rapidly destroyed in nuclear fusion reactions. Brown dwarfs can retain their lithium, however. Due to lithium's very low ignition temperature of 2.5 × 106 K, the highest-mass brown dwarfs will burn it eventually, and so determining the highest mass of brown dwarfs still containing lithium in the cluster can give an idea of its age. Applying this technique to the Pleiades gives an age of about 115 million years.|$|E

5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) entertains her parents, William Scully (Don Davis) and Margaret Scully (Sheila Larken), {{shortly after}} Christmas. After they leave, she falls asleep on her sofa. Several hours later, {{she wakes up}} to see her father sitting across from her, {{speaking}} silently. The telephone rings, and after <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> phone, she finds the chair empty again. She answers the call—from her mother, who tells her that her father {{died of a heart}} attack an hour earlier.|$|E
5|$|Fuseli painted other {{versions}} of The Nightmare following {{the success of}} the first; at least three survive. The other important canvas was painted between 1790 and 1791 and is held at the Goethe Museum in Frankfurt. It is smaller than the original, and the woman's head lies to the left; a mirror opposes her on the right. The demon is <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> woman rather than out of the picture, and it has pointed, catlike ears. The most significant difference in the remaining two versions is an erotic statuette of a couple on the table.|$|E

5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision {{that allowed him to}} conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. He used to say that he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E
5|$|He {{explains}} that the assassin was not hired to kill Warren St. Claire, but to kill the bodyguard instead. When Vasquez had discovered that Lloyd was embezzling campaign funds, he approached the bodyguard about murdering Vasquez. As the bodyguard refused {{to carry out the}} murder, Lloyd had him killed. To prove his theory, Monk shows a photograph of Lloyd <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> direction of the shooter just after the shots were fired. Monk proves that Lloyd's sight line was obstructed, and that the gunshot's echo would have masked the direction of the shot. As such, it was impossible that Lloyd could have known where the shots were coming from unless he already knew where the gunman would be.|$|E
5|$|He {{wrote for}} series {{five of the}} BBC2 impressionist sketch show Dead Ringers, and voiced Mitch in the Disney {{animated}} series Phineas and Ferb. He also narrated the reality show Beauty and the Geek. Following the success of Channel 4's Alternative Election Night in 2010, which Mitchell hosted with Jimmy Carr, Charlie Brooker and Lauren Laverne, the four presented 10 O'Clock Live, a series of live shows <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> week's affairs. Mitchell has a solo segment entitled Listen to Mitchell. The show has run for three series.|$|E
