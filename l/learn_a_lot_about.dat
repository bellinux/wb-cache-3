25|$|Viagem ao Céu ("Voyage to the Sky"). Pedrinho befriends an {{invisible}} magic being nicknamed Feather, {{which he has}} to wear in the head so people can disguise where he is. This being travels throughout space and time using a powerful magic powder, the Pirlimpimpim, and Pedrinho finds himself in possession of some as Feather forgets (or intentionally leaves) his knapsack on Pedrinho's bed. Using the powder, Pedrinho and the others take a trip through the Solar System and <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> the planets and get to meet several mythical beings.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Wood was {{the third}} fastest runner in Taylor County and was scouted by coach Leslie “Fats” Cranfill from Hardin-Simmons University, who offered Wood a partial {{athletic}} scholarship to Hardin-Simmons. After some convincing, Wood's father gave him his blessing and set his son up living with a friend in Abilene. Eventually, Wood earned a full scholarship, and the University provided him with room and board. At Hardin-Simmons, Wood played football and basketball, ran track, and boxed {{in order to maintain}} his scholarship. Despite nearly flunking out his first semester, Wood did well in college. He was never a star athlete at the university, but he did <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> sports and coaching. It was at Hardin-Simmons that Wood decided {{he wanted to be a}} coach.|$|E
500|$|Miss Rosa {{played a}} minor role {{throughout}} the first season. Rosenblat had {{admitted that she}} only appeared sporadically and did not get to portray much. But the actress was eager to return for the show's second season. But during the second season the role was expanded which surprised Rosenblat. The actress told a reporter from Indiewire, [...] "I learned where Miss Rosa is from I learned why she's in prison. You're going to <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> her, a lot that I was desperate to know, and it helps." [...] In March 2014, series creator Jenji Kohan told Jessie Katz (The Hollywood Reporter) that viewers would be introduced to Miss Rosa's backstory. When the writers had planned a backstory episode for the character, Rosenblat was delighted. But the development left her unsure how Miss Rosa's story would fit into main storyline of Orange Is the New Black.|$|E

500|$|It was in Socha Na Tha (2004) that Kukunoor noticed Ayesha Takia {{and until}} then he assumed {{her to be}} a glamor doll. After getting {{convinced}} about her acting skills, she was roped in for the character of Meera. Takia said that though her character emotionally drained her, it was not tough to portray and that she could <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> life. She further said that, [...] "Dor was indeed an exciting challenge for the actor in me. I am happy that it was also a very exciting role, which not many actors get to portray at such a young age." [...] She said that with Dor, she was not only in the film industry for glamor, but also for her acting prowess. While filming, Kukunoor bonded so well with Takia that he requested her to be his sister. Since she did not have a brother in real life, she got quite emotional with Kukunoor's brotherly proposal. This affection eventually solemnized {{in the form of a}} rakhi symbolically.|$|E
500|$|When Stengel {{reported}} to the Giants on July 1, 1921, they were managed, {{as they had been}} for almost 20 years, by John McGraw. Stengel biographer Robert W. Creamer said of McGraw, [...] "his Giants were the most feared, the most respected, the most admired team in baseball." [...] Stengel biographer Marty Appel noted, [...] "McGraw and Stengel. Teacher and student. Casey was about to <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> managing." [...] Stengel had time to learn, playing in only 18 games for the Giants in 1921, mostly as a pinch hitter, and watched from his place on the bench as McGraw led the Giants from a 7 game deficit on August 24 to the National League pennant. Although he was on the 25-player postseason roster, Stengel did not appear in the 1921 World Series against the Yankees, as McGraw used only 13 players (4 of them pitchers) [...] in beating the Yankees, five games to three. The only contribution Stengel made to the box score was being ejected from Game 5 for arguing.|$|E
2500|$|The 1909 {{season was}} played under changed rules. The rule changes for 1909 {{included}} reducing {{the value of}} a field goal (whether by drop kick or place kick) from four points to three points. [...] Michigan's Board in Control of Athletics also re-established a freshman football team in 1909 after the freshman football program had been ceased four years earlier. [...] Michigan head coach Fielding H. Yost said at the time, [...] "It is to the freshmen that we must look for our future Michigan teams and I am glad that it has been decided to allow us to have such a team. [...] Under competent coaching such as they will have the men will <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> the Michigan style of playing and this will be invaluable when they come up for the Varsity team in future years." [...] Prentiss Douglass was hired as the coach of the freshman team, and he led the freshman to a 5-0 record.|$|E

60|$|Ballantyne's style often {{gives rise}} to two or even three stories {{continuing}} simultaneously, {{and here we have}} the adventures of one Rooney Machowl, an Irishman who decides to move from his ship's carpenter trade to that of diving. In fact divers should always have another trade, or they wouldn't be much use under the water. In addition there is the aspiration of Edgar Berrington to win the hand of a fair young lady, there are the events happening to the young lady's father, and then again the events happening to the young lady's companion. So it is all fairly convoluted. But you'll certainly <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> diving, as the art stood in 1876. It is rather strange that Ballantyne, having written this book, which ran to several printings, did not much mention diving in any other of his books.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I {{ought to}} feel very miserable," [...] {{he said to}} himself. [...] "I can't make out why I don't. Here am I shut up with about a hundred as villainous-looking fellows as one could want to see--something like half of them murderers, all desperate criminals. I ought to be down in the dumps. It seems unnatural that I shouldn't be. I suppose I {{have a sort of}} Mark Tapley disposition, and get jolly under difficulties. Of course I should feel it more if I hadn't made up my mind to escape somehow. The colonel seems a good sort of fellow, and even the prisoners speak well of him. Then it is a comfort to hear that all that talk about the {{quicksilver}} mines was a lie, and the work is going to be no worse than a gold-digger would have in California or a navvy at home. There is no great hardship about that, at any rate for a time. If it was not for the thought of how horribly anxious they must be at home about me, I should not mind. It will be something to talk about all one's life. The first thing for me to do is to learn from the others as much as possible about the country. I have learned a lot about the geography of Siberia from Alexis, and have got a good idea about all the rivers. I dare say I shall learn a good deal more from some of these men. Another thing is to pick up as much of their language as I can from these Tartar fellows. They seem to be scattered pretty well all over the country. At least I have seen some of them all the way I have gone. I know there are other tribes. Those fishing chaps they call Ostjaks are the ones I should have most to do with. I expect one could get on with them if one happened to get them in the right vein. I suppose they speak some sort of dialect like that of these Tartars. At any rate I should think it would be sure to be near enough for the natives to understand each other. I believe Russian helps with all these languages, for the Russians are themselves only civilized Tartars. At any rate {{one of the first things}} to be done is to learn to speak the language, and I should be able to <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> the country from them too. I have got eight or nine months before one can think of making a start, for of course it must be done in the spring. It is the end of September now, though I have lost all account of the days of the month." ...|$|E
