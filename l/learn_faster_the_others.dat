40|$|We {{present a}} method for the {{classification}} of multi-labelled text documents explicitly designed for data stream applications that require to process a virtually infinite sequence of data using constant memory and constant processing time. Our method is composed of an online procedure used to efficiently map text into a low-dimensional feature space and a partition of this space into a set of regions for which the system extracts and keeps statistics used to predict multi-label text annotations. Documents are fed into {{the system as a}} sequence of words, mapped to a region of the partition, and annotated using the statistics computed from the labelled instances colliding in the same region. This approach is referred to as clashing. We illustrate the method in real-world text data, comparing the results with those obtained using other text classifiers. In addition, we provide an analysis about the effect of the representation space dimensionality on the predictive performance of the system. Our results show that the online embedding indeed approximates the geometry of the full corpus-wise TF and TF-IDF space. The model obtains competitive F measures with respect to the most accurate methods, using significantly fewer computational resources. In addition, the method achieves a higher macro-averaged F measure than methods with similar running time. Furthermore, the system is able to <b>learn</b> <b>faster</b> than <b>the</b> <b>other</b> methods from partially labelled streams...|$|R
40|$|Augmentative {{communication}} systems that utilize {{a combination of}} unaided and aided modalities provide augmented communicators potential advantages that are not available in single modality systems. One potential advantage is that individuals are provided the opportunity to utilize the modality or combination of modalities that is most suited to their style of language learning. For children with intellectual disabilities, the augmentative modality of choice has traditionally been manual sign language. However, success in using this approach has been limited to teaching single word vocabularies, with few reports {{in the literature of}} the development of multiword combinations. The aim {{of the present study was}} to teach two word combinations to two subjects (one with a mild and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> with a moderate level of intellectual disability) who had extensive single word repertoires in sign. The study compared the effectiveness of two augmentative communication techniques: (a) unimodal, which was manual sign language alone; and (b) multimodal, which was manual sign language plus the use of an electronic communication aid. The results indicated that treatment, overall, was effective in teaching two word combinations and that one subject <b>learned</b> <b>faster</b> than <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> However, <b>the</b> subjects showed differences in the comparative effectiveness of the two augmentative communication techniques. For one subject, both treatments were equally effective, but his subject showed a preference for using the aided over the unaided modality for all responses. For <b>the</b> <b>other</b> subject, <b>the</b> multimodal technique was found to be more effective than the unimodal technique, but this subject showed preferences for the two modalities that varied across experimental contexts. The results suggest that the two subjects adopted different language learning styles, and that these styles are similar to those that have been identified in children who are nondisabled. ...|$|R

Background {{is presented in}} the next section. In the following section, a simula-tion model for this case is investigated. Then a proposed process reengineering is considered. This case is adapted from Jarmain (1963), Problem 3. 3. 1. 1 Quality Image Future Electronics Company is a medium-sized ® rm producing a line of special-ized integrated circuits. Because of the delicate production processes involved, only 30 to 50 percent of the items produced prove usable. Therefore, all units produced must undergo testing before sale. The management of Future has for some time been worried about their quality image. From time to time they have heard such statements from customers as: are generally quite satis ® ed with your quality, and consider you one of our highest quality suppliers, but are bothered by some of the variations which occur. Every so often, we receive a series of poor shipments from you. These create a disruption of our production, and we are forced to ® nd a supplier whose quality is more dependable, even if their best is not as good as yours. " While customers are not always so outspoken, Future has noticed that at times customers return many defective units, but at other times these same customers return very few defectives. The management of Future is quite sensitive to this situation and upon notic-ing increased complaints and returns, they hire more people to increase the thoroughness of the testing procedure. They base their hiring decision on the number of testers presently employed and on the frequency of complaints. Learning the complex testing procedure requires several months training, al-though some trainees <b>learn</b> <b>faster</b> than <b>others.</b> <b>The</b> testers in training do not test parts for shipment, since Future does not wish to take the chance that inex-perienced testers might let bad units get through. The new people are trained by experienced employees. An experienced tester assigned to the training of...|$|R

40|$|In the {{extensive}} literature on learning curves, scholars have ignored outcome measures of organizational performance evaluated by customers. We explore whether customer dissatisfaction follows a learning-curve pattern. Do organizations learn to reduce customer dissatisfaction? Customer dissatisfaction occurs when customers' ex ante expectations about {{a product or}} service exceed ex post perceptions about the product or service. Because customers can increase expectations over time, customer dissatisfaction may not decline even when the product or service improves. Consequently, it {{is an open question}} whether customer dissatisfaction follows a learning-curve pattern. Drawing from the literatures on learning curves and organizational learning, we hypothesize that customer dissatisfaction follows a U-shaped function of operating experience (Hypothesis 1), that focused airlines <b>learn</b> <b>faster</b> to reduce customer dissatisfaction than full-service airlines (Hypothesis 2), and that organizational learning curves for customer dissatisfaction are heterogeneous across airlines (Hypothesis 3). We test these hypotheses with quarterly data covering 1987 to 1998 on consumer complaints against the 10 largest U. S. airlines. We find strong support for Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 3. Hypothesis 2 is not supported {{in the sense that the}} average focused airline did not <b>learn</b> <b>faster</b> than <b>the</b> average full-service airline. However, we do find that the best focused airline <b>learns</b> <b>faster</b> than <b>the</b> best full-service airline.
