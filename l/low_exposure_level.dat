40|$|Abstract: Recently {{many studies}} on {{the health effects of}} workers who exposed to low-concentration styrene have been published. In this paper firstly we {{mentioned}} the reasons why nervous system was critical organ for evaluating the toxicity of organic solvents both in the acute and chronic exposure phases. Then we indicated how neurobehavioral test batteries were useful to detect subclinical adverse health effects of workers exposed to organic solvents. Secondly we reviewed many epidemiological {{studies on the}} impairment of neurobehavioral function, i. e., perceptual speed, memory, cognition, personality and mood, and the loss of color vision among styrene workers. Finally, we showed our recent data on the relationship between color vision loss and the concentration of urine metabolites among styrene workers. It can conclude that styrene may cause damage on nervous system, even at the <b>low</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level</b> such as 50 ppm which used to be the Threshold Limit Valu...|$|E
40|$|F- 344 rats {{were exposed}} 6 hours/day, 5 days/week {{for up to}} 24 months to 1 mg/cubicmeter SiO 2 or 5 mg/cubicmeter TiO 2. A third group of rats inhaled {{filtered}} air. No treatment-related effects on life span or causes of deaths were observed. The final sacrifices started 6 weeks {{after the end of}} the exposure interval. The lung weight of the silica-exposed animals doubled, while the TiO 2 -treated animals had lung weights similar to those of the control group. An incidence of 18 % of lung tumors was observed in the silica exposed animals. Tumors were first observed after 21 months in the study. The incidence of lung tumors in the control and TiO 2 -exposed groups was 2 - 3 %. The significance of the results is that the silica-induced tumors were detected after a relatively <b>low</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level.</b> The small particle size with corresponding large surface area of the silica used may be one factor for the increased tumor rate observed...|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} microcystins {{in blood}} from {{people at risk}} for swallowing water or inhaling spray while swimming, water skiing, jet skiing, or boating during an algal bloom. We monitored water samples from a small lake as a Microcystis aeruginosa bloom developed. We recruited 97 people planning recreational activities in that lake and seven others who volunteered to recreate in a nearby bloom-free lake. We conducted our field study {{within a week of}} finding a 10 -ÃŽÂ¼g/L microcystin concentration. We analyzed water, air, and human blood samples for water quality, potential human pathogens, algal taxonomy, and microcystin concentrations. We interviewed study participants for demographic and current health symptom information. Water samples were assayed for potential respiratory viruses (adenoviruses and enteroviruses), but none were detected. We did find low concentrations of Escherichia coli, indicating fecal contamination. We found low levels of microcystins (2 ÃŽÂ¼g/L to 5 ÃŽÂ¼g/L) in the water and (< 0. 1 ng/m 3) in the aerosol samples. Blood levels of microcystins for all participants were below the limit of detection (0. 147 ÃŽÂ¼g/L). Given this <b>low</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level,</b> study participants reported no symptom increases following recreational exposure to microcystins. This is the first study to report that water-based recreational activities can expose people to very low concentrations of aerosol-borne microcystins; we recently conducted another field study to assess exposures to higher concentrations of these algal toxins...|$|E

40|$|We studied {{exposure}} to asbestos, pulmonary fibrosis, fiber count, and fiber size {{in relation to}} the lobar origin of lung cancer in 90 consecutive patients. Among the 32 patients with a history of occupational {{exposure to}} asbestos, 22 were construction workers. The proportion of lower-lobe tumors increased with the duration of exposure from 45 % in those working less than 15 years to 82 % in those working 15 years or more in the construction trade, as compared with 25 % in patients who were probably not exposed. The location of the tumor in the lower lobe was explained by the high number of total fibers [odds ratio (OR) = 9. 0, CI = 2. 3 - 34. 6), of fibers 3 microns and longer (OR = 22. 1, CI = 3. 9 - 125), and fibers of anthophyllite (OR = 14. 6, CI = 2. 4 - 83. 4) and crocidolite (OR = 7. 0, CI = 1. 2 - 41. 2) when the effect of smoking and fibrosis was adjusted in the logistic regression analysis. The location of the tumor did not correlate with fibrosis, pack-years smoked, or the number of short (< 3 microns) fibers. Our findings suggest that asbestos causes an excess of lower-lobe tumors at a relatively <b>low</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level,</b> independently of pulmonary fibrosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether the effects of dust overload are reversible upon cessation of subchronic exposure to test toner. Female rats were exposed 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 3 months to a test toner at 0, 10, and 40 mg/m 3. The retained quantity of test toner in the lungs at the end of exposure was 0. 4 and 3. 0 mg for the low and high exposure groups, respectively. Fifteen months later, the corresponding values were 0. 12 and 2. 65 mg in the lungs. Alveolar clearance of tracer aerosols as well as cytologic and enzymatic parameters in the bronchoalveolar fluid was investigated at the end of exposure and subsequently up to 15 months later. The alveolar clearance of 59 Fe 2 O 3, 51 Cr-polystyrene, and 85 Sr-polystyrene tracer aerosols was slightly retarded at the low and substantially impaired at the high exposure level. At the <b>low</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level,</b> there was some recovery in the clearance behavior up to 6 months after exposure. In contrast, at the high exposure level there was no indication of a reversal of the impaired clearance. For the beta-glucuronidase activity and the number of polymorphonuclear cells, the pattern of the effects was similar to the effects on the half-time tracer particle clearance. In conclusion, the dust overload at a lung burden of 3 mg test toner in rats was persistent for at least 15 months after termination of exposure...|$|E
40|$|Exposure {{measurements}} {{from several}} countries indicate {{that humans are}} routinely exposed to low levels of bisphenol A (BPA), a synthetic xenoestrogen widely used {{in the production of}} polycarbonate plastics. There is considerable debate about whether this exposure represents an environmental risk, based on reports that BPA interferes with the development of many organs and that it may alter cognitive functions and mood. Consistent with these reports, we have previously demonstrated that BPA antagonizes spine synapse formation induced by estrogens and testosterone in limbic brain areas of gonadectomized female and male rats. An important limitation of these studies, however, is that they were based on rodent animal models, which may not be representative of the effects of human BPA exposure. To address this issue, we examined the influence of continuous BPA administration, at a daily dose equal to the current U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's reference safe daily limit, on estradiol-induced spine synapse formation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of a nonhuman primate model. Our data indicate that even at this relatively <b>low</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level,</b> BPA completely abolishes the synaptogenic response to estradiol. Because remodeling of spine synapses may {{play a critical role in}} cognition and mood, the ability of BPA to interfere with spine synapse formation has profound implications. This study is the first to demonstrate an adverse effect of BPA on the brain in a nonhuman primate model and further amplifies concerns about the widespread use of BPA in medical equipment, and in food preparation and storage...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether the effects if lung overloading are reversible upon cessation of a subchronic exposure to test toner. Female SPF F- 344 rats were exposed 6 hrs/day 5 days/week for 3 months to test toner at 0, 10 and 40 mg/m 3. Alveolar clearance of an 85 Sr-polystyrene tracer aerosol, and retention of the toner in lungs and lymph nodes were evaluated at the end of exposure and subsequently up to 15 months later. The retained quantity of test toner in the lungs at the end of exposure was 0. 4 and 3 mg for the low and high exposure groups, respectively. 15 months later the corresponding values were 0. 12 and 2. 65 mg in the lungs. The alveolar clearance of the tracer aerosol was slightly retarded at the low and substantially impaired at the high exposure level. At the <b>low</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level,</b> there was some recovery in the slowed clearance behaviour sixmonths post exposure. In contrast, at the high exposure level, there was no indication of a reversal of the im paired clearance. A kinetic model was developed to describe retention of test toner and of labelled particles in the lungs and in the lymph nodes. The assumptions are the following: The lung is divided into two compartments, which contain mobile and immobile macrophages, respectively. Macrophages with a particle burden above a critical volume are immobilized. By chemotaxis the nearest macrophages can migrate into the compartment of immobile macrophages. With this model all experimental data can be fitted well by only 5 parameters...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{systematically}} reviewed epidemiologic {{studies on}} ambient {{air pollution and}} congenital anomalies and conducted meta-analyses {{for a number of}} air pollutant–anomaly combinations. Data s o u r c e s a n d extraction: From bibliographic searches we extracted 10 original epidemiologic studies that examined the association between congenital anomaly risk and concentrations of air pollutants. Meta-analyses were conducted if at least four studies published risk estimates for the same pollutant and anomaly group. Summary risk estimates were calculated for a) risk at high versus <b>low</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level</b> in each study and b) risk per unit increase in continuous pollutant concentration. Data synthesis: Each individual study reported statistically significantly increased risks for some combinations of air pollutants and congenital anomalies, among many combinations tested. In meta-analyses, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) exposures were related to increases in risk of coarctation of the aorta [odds ratio (OR) per 10 ppb NO 2 = 1. 17; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 00 – 1. 36; OR per 1 ppb SO 2 = 1. 07; 95 % CI, 1. 01 – 1. 13] and tetralogy of Fallot (OR per 10 ppb NO 2 = 1. 20; 95 % CI, 1. 02 – 1. 42; OR per 1 ppb SO 2 = 1. 03; 95 % CI, 1. 01 – 1. 05), and PM 10 (particulate matter ≤ 10 µm) exposure was related to an increased risk of atrial septal defects (OR per 10 μg/m 3 = 1. 14; 95 % CI, 1. 01 – 1. 28).

40|$|Estuarine {{bivalves}} {{are exposed}} {{to a variety of}} chemical pollutants present in the water column and fixed in sediments. Chemicals including (xeno) oestrogens have endocrine disrupting effects, which can affect the reproduction of organisms. This paper examines the reproductive cycles of two Cerastoderma edule populations over a six month period to assess reproductive condition and intersex. In addition, a further study of ten native sites from SW England was conducted at peak reproductive season to identify the presence of intersex. Exposure experiments were carried out on field populations with dissolved and sediment-bound endocrine disruptors. Intersex was revealed in eight out of ten native populations of C. edule, whereas laboratory exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals did not induce intersex in C. edule. However there was a significant departure from normal sex ratio when exposed to 17 –β oestradiol (10 μg l- 1). Scrobicularia plana exposure resulted in intersex at both exposure levels (0. 18 μg g- 1 and 1. 8 μg g- 1) of bisphenol– A and the <b>low</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level</b> showed a marked departure from the normal 1 : 1 sex ratio. There was a significant difference between low and high bisphenol–A sex ratios compared to the native population but not to the control exposure group. These results reinforce the concerns linked to the effects of endocrine disruptors and suggest that endocrine disrupting chemicals could be contributing factors towards the development of intersex in ecologically and commercially important species of bivalves. This study highlights the need to understand the effects and mechanisms of endocrine disruption and serves as a reference for future research on the environmental implications of pollution in estuarine systems...|$|E

40|$|A unique echelle {{spectrometer}} system employing charge injection device (CID) array detectors {{for use in}} inductively coupled plasma atomic {{emission spectroscopy}} (ICP-AES) is described. The echelle spectrometer described offers numerous advantages over previous systems including improved light throughput and extended wavelength coverage including the vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) down to 165 nm. Several improvements in CID array detector technology are also described. <b>Low</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level</b> linearity is improved and full well capacity is increased by fabricating the CIDs with silicon as opposed to silicon. Low sensitivity in the far-ultraviolet (far-UV) has been considered a major disadvantage when using silicon based detectors due to absorbance in the overlying gate structure of the devices. The problem has been circumvented by utilizing a wavelength conversion phosphor to improve the effective sensitivity in the far-UV. The read noise of the CID has been reduced {{by a factor of}} 3 by utilizing a preamplifier on every row of the device. Utilization of this system for ICP-AES yields numerous advantages over conventional photomultiplier tube (PMT) based systems. Elemental detection limits comparable to or better than those obtained on PMT based instrumentation are achieved in the UV and visible regions. Sensitivities at wavelength less than 200 nm are degraded by a factor of 5 relative to PMT based systems due to decreased echelle grating efficiency in that wavelength region. In most cases, the advantages of continuous wavelength coverage provided by CID array detectors outweighs any loss in sensitivity. Operating parameters including precision, resolution and background correction are also discussed. Analysis of both the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Materials (SRM) 1643 b and 1646 demonstrates that the system is capable of the simultaneous determination {{of a large number of}} elements at a large number of wavelengths with a high degree of accuracy even in spectrally complex matrices...|$|E

The associations between traffic related health effects have been 13 reported mostly for European and North America, but very few for densely populated urban environments in Asia. Objective: To assess traffic related health effects in the population of Hong Kong. Methods: Residential locations of persons who died during 2010 were documented in 209 Tertiary Planning Units (TPU) of Hong Kong. The 2010 Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data were retrieved from traffic census reports. Three indicators of trafficrelated exposure by TPU were computed using ArcGIS (version 9. 2) : (i) Road Density (RD) = total length of roads divided by area; (ii) Traffic Density (TD) = RD times AADT; and (iii) Vehicle Density (VD) = AADT divided by area. They were further categorizing into three levels by tertile: low, middle and high. Poisson regression models of standardized mortality ratios were fitted with adjustment for ethnicity, marital status, education level, housing type and income. Results: The ranges of risk ratios (95 % CI) of mortality for high or middle relative to <b>low</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level</b> were: for all-nature causes 1. 17 (1. 13 - 1. 21) - 1. 32 (1. 27 - 1. 36), cardiovascular 1. 16 (1. 09 - 1. 23) - 1. 27 (1. 19 - 1. 37), respiratory 1. 30 (1. 20 - 1. 42) - 1. 44 (1. 33 - 1. 56), and cancer 1. 08 (1. 02 - 1. 14) - 1. 28 (1. 20 - 1. 36). The risk ratios were the highest for the middle level of TD or VD, but increased from middle to high level of RD. Conclusions: Traffic related exposures measured at the neighborhood levels are associated with mortality. Investigations at individual levels are necessary to account for confounding...|$|E

40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} study {{was aimed at}} reconstructing the exposure to gasoline in 102 petrol station attendants by environmental and biological monitoring of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) and biomonitoring of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). Airborne BTEX were higher for manual refuelers than self-service assistants and were highly correlated with each other. Significant relationships were found between airborne BTX and the corresponding urinary solvents (U-BTX) and beween airborne B and urinary MTBE (U-MTBE). Smokers eliminated higher values of U-B, trans,trans-muconic (t,t-MA) and S-phenylmercapturic (S-PMA) acids but not U-MTBE. All these biomarkers were, however, significantly raised during the shift, independently from smoking. Linear regression confirmed that occupational exposure was a main predictor of U-MTBE, U-B and S-PMA values, both the latter confounded by smoking habits. The study supports the usefulness of biomonitoring even at <b>low</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} the risk of hydrocarbon-induced chronic nephropathy is negligible at <b>low</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels.</b> The first {{purpose of the study}} was to test this hypothesis by selecting a population slightly exposed to hydrocarbons. Moreover, as hypertension might be associated with an increased excretion of nephrotoxic mercapturates, the association between blood pressure and urinary concentration of S-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) was also examined. Lifetime exposure assessment, main tests of subclinical kidney damage, and statistical approach were taken from a previous study that had included primarily moderately or heavily exposed workers and had found hydrocarbon-induced nephrotoxic effects. No nephrotoxic effect of exposure could be ascertained in the present study. S-PMA concentration was not increased in hypertensive workers. Thus, the risk of hydrocarbon-induced chronic nephropathy might be extremely low in workers slightly exposed to hydrocarbons. The negative results of some studies might be due to the <b>low</b> lifetime hydrocarbon <b>exposures</b> of the study populations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Due to {{the present}} {{evidence}} for reproductive toxicity of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) among female personnel in health care, exposure of 17 female workers employed in two post-anesthesia care units was evaluated. Geometric mean concentration of nitrous oxide for six recovery room personnel was 3. 1 ppm versus 1. 17 ppm for eleven employees in surgical nursing units. The longest time needed to reach zero concentration of nitrous oxide in postoperative nursing units was 9. 5 h. The result of correlation analysis did neither show any association between duration of nitrous oxide exhaled from patients and patient-related factors. It is very unlikely that these <b>low</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> can cause any adverse health effect among pregnant PACU employees. However, for those institutions that seek extra protective measures, reassignment of pregnant employees needs to be extended for several hours after a patient is admitted in the PACU units...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory-generated animal {{bioassay}} data often {{serve as}} the basis for estimating potential human cancer risk. However, there is no single procedure that has been universally accepted as the method of choice for extrapolating experimentally observed results to the <b>low</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> that are generally of public health concern. All of the models proposed to date suffer from various limitations. Therefore, the most prudent approach may be to rely primarily on the more conservative procedures such as linear extrapolation until a better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the process of carcinogenesis is attained. In addition to the choice of an extrapolation model, there are a variety of other factors, such as the incorporation of background cancer rates, the potential for synergistic reactions, differential pharmacokinetic effects and differences in exposure regimen, that can have a significant bearing on the extrapolation of animal carcinogenicity data to man...|$|R
