5|$|A second joint {{appearance}} {{took place}} in Beverly Hills. According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold, Douglas arrived late, while Nixon was already speaking. Nixon ostentatiously <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch, provoking laughter from the audience. The laughter recurred as Nixon, sitting behind Douglas as she spoke, fidgeted to indicate his disapproval {{of what she was}} saying; she appeared bewildered at the laughter. Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again, but she did not stay to listen.|$|E

5|$|Aiyer sent Ramanujan, {{with letters}} of introduction, to his {{mathematician}} friends in Madras. Some of them <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> work {{and gave him}} letters of introduction to R. Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore {{and the secretary of}} the Indian Mathematical Society. Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable Bombay mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a phony. Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent series, which Rao said ultimately converted him to a belief in Ramanujan's brilliance. When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research, with Rao's financial aid taking care of his daily needs. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, Rommel {{received}} a promotion from Hitler {{to the rank}} of Generalmajor ahead of more senior officers. Showalter notes that even at this early stage, Hitler already regarded Rommel {{as a model for the}} fusion of Germany's new and old orders. With an intervention by Hitler, Rommel was subsequently able to obtain command of an armoured (Panzer) division despite having been turned down by the army's personnel office, which had offered him command of a mountain division. Rommel's unprofessional conduct was noted by his fellow officers and added to his growing reputation as one of Hitler's favoured commanders. After the Fall of France, Rommel sent to him a specially prepared diary on the 7th Division, Rommel {{received a}} letter of thanks. Unknown to Rommel though, Hitler had barely <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> diary and the letter was written by an adjutant. Remy remarks that by this time, Hitler still did not treat Rommel as a significantly important person.|$|E

[...] Trump's ambitions may have spawned earlier. The America We Deserve co-writer Dave Shiflett said Trump first thought about running in late 1998, when he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> political advantages in money and name recognition, and concluded that he was [...] "at least as competent" [...] as then President Bill Clinton. According to Shiflett, this prompted Trump to ask top aide Roger Stone to find the [...] "most eminent hack writer in America" [...] to put Trump's political ideas into a book. [...] Stone reached out to Shiflett, a contributor to The American Spectator. In spring 1999, Shiflett met with Trump about the project that would later become The America We Deserve. [...] During the initial meeting, Shiflett claims Trump raised concerns about a suitcase bomb destroying Manhattan.|$|E

2500|$|Garcia {{experienced}} several tragedies {{during his}} youth. At age four, while {{the family was}} vacationing in the Santa Cruz Mountains, two-thirds of Garcia's right middle finger was accidentally cut off. Garcia and his brother Tiff were chopping wood.

After his mother wrapped his hand in a towel, Garcia's father drove him over 30 [...] miles to the nearest hospital. A few weeks later, Garcia — who had not <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> finger since the accident — was surprised to discover most of it missing when the bandage he was wearing came off during a bath. Garcia later confided that he often used it to his advantage in his youth, showing it off to other children in his neighborhood.|$|E
2500|$|Captain Joseph Hazelwood, who {{was widely}} {{reported}} to have been drinking heavily that night, {{was not at the}} controls when the ship struck the reef. However, as the senior officer, he was in command of the ship even though he was asleep in his bunk.

At the helm, the third mate never would have collided with Bligh Reef had he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> RAYCAS radar. But the radar was not turned on.

It's segregation, I thought, just like a Negroes' Department. I turned around and walked out. That was the start of my open protests. That same year I organized a demonstration in Ashkelon against Ben-Gurion's racist policies and 10,000 people turned out." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1887, prematurely {{gray and}} badly ailing, Holliday {{made his way}} to the Hotel Glenwood, near the hot springs of Glenwood Springs, Colorado. [...] He hoped to take {{advantage}} of the reputed curative power of the waters, but the sulfurous fumes from the spring may have done his lungs more harm than good. As he lay dying, Holliday is reported to have asked the nurse attending him for a shot of whiskey. When she told him no, he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> bootless feet, amused. The nurses said that his last words were, [...] "This is funny." [...] He always figured he would be killed someday with his boots on. Holliday died at 10am on November 8, 1887. He was 36. [...] Wyatt Earp did not learn of Holliday's death until two months afterward. Horony later said that she attended to him in his final days, and one contemporary source appears to back her claim.|$|E

[...] However, Flidhais was overcome with guilt as she looked in Oilill's unblinking all-knowing eyes and she was horrified at {{what had happened to her}} husband.

The troops retrieved Oilill's body and when Flidhais <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> body, gashed all over and covered in blood, she was again filled with such remorse she began to recount his every worthy action during his lifetime. [...] Tradition maintains that Oilill is buried just north of Inver in a tumulus which is marked on today's maps as a 'mound'.|$|E

Collatio laureationis) is {{the formal}} public speech of {{acceptance}} by {{him of the}} title poet laureate on April 8, 1341 (Easter Sunday), {{for his work on}} Africa about Cornelius Scipio. Petrarch's speech, given {{in the form of a}} medieval sermon, demonstrates the gradual transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. It is considered the first manifesto of the Renaissance. Petrarch <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> laureateship as political. In his grand speech he said of the description of his laurel that it was ...equally appropriate of Caesars and poets. It was a triumphal event where trumpets were blared. King Robert gave Petrarch a special robe to wear in honor of this event. He was given the titles of [...] "poet," [...] "master," [...] "professor" [...] of poetry and history and [...] "the most famous private citizen then living." [...] At the time of the coronation, the Africa consisted of just a few books (maybe four out of the nine written).|$|E

He had lost consciousness {{the day before and}} died with his wife, children, and sisters at his side. His sister, Mona Simpson, described his death thus: [...] "Steve's final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times. Before embarking, he'd <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life's partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them. Steve's final words were: 'Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.'" [...] He then lost consciousness and died several hours later. A small private funeral was held on October 7, 2011, the details of which were not revealed out of respect for Jobs's family. At the time of his death, his biological mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, was living in a nursing home and suffering from dementia. She was not told that he died.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1968, {{their first}} album Truth was released; by October it {{had risen to}} number 15 on the US albums chart but failed to chart in the UK. The album {{featured}} Beck's masterly guitar technique and manipulated sounds as Stewart's dramatic vocalising tackled the group's varied repertoire of blues, folk, rock, and proto-heavy metal. Stewart also co-wrote three of the songs, and credited the record for helping to develop his vocal abilities and the sandpaper quality in his voice. The group toured America again {{at the end of}} the year to a very strong reception, then suffered from more personnel upheaval (something that would continue throughout Beck's career). In July 1969, Stewart left, following his friend Wood's departure. Stewart later recalled: [...] "It was a great band to sing with but I couldn't take all the aggravation and unfriendliness that developed.... In the two and a half years I was with Beck I never once looked him in the eye – I always <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> shirt or something like that." ...|$|E
