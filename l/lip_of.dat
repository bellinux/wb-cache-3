5|$|Experiments {{investigating}} the splash dispersal of peridioles {{have shown a}} maximum horizontal distance for peridiole ejection of , less than that observed for other Cyathus species.

5|$|Saratoga {{received}} a RCA CXAM-1 {{early warning radar}} in February 1941 during a refit in Bremerton. The antenna was mounted on the forward <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> the funnel with its control room directly below the aerial, replacing the secondary conning station formerly mounted there. She also received two FC (Mk 3) surface fire-control radars in late 1941, although these were both removed along with her main armament in January 1942. The new dual-purpose guns were controlled by two Mk 37 directors, each mounting an FD (Mk 4) anti-aircraft gunnery radar. When the 1.1-inch guns were replaced by 40mm guns in 1942, the directors for the smaller guns were replaced by five Mk 51 directors. A small SC-1 early warning radar was mounted on the rear <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> the funnel during 1942. A SG surface-search radar was mounted on the foremast at the same time.|$|E

5|$|A {{study from}} 2008 {{indicates}} that sexual dimorphism occurs early during this species' ontogeny. L.canarium males reach sexual maturity at a shorter shell length {{when compared to}} females. Individuals {{are considered to be}} adult by the time the outer <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> their shell is noticeably thickened and flared; growth to adult size takes about a year. The maximum life span of the dog conch differs between sexes; it is estimated at 2 and 2.5 years for females and males, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Before, Beyoncé's {{approach}} to heartbreak was always literal, {{her voice and}} her words declaiming her feelings with a studied earnestness that at times was difficult to believe, let alone connect with. 'Irreplaceable' is the first song in which Beyoncé lies to herself, and the way her voice perfectly betrays that lie (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff upper <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated and her most honest performance to date.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{and goats}} are closely related: both {{are in the}} {{subfamily}} Caprinae. However, they are separate species, so hybrids rarely occur, and are always infertile. A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a sheep-goat hybrid (only a single such animal has been confirmed), and {{is not to be}} confused with the sheep-goat chimera, though both are known as geep. Visual differences between sheep and goats include the beard of goats and divided upper <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> sheep. Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or docked, while the short tails of goats are held upwards. Also, sheep breeds are often naturally polled (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially). Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during the rut, whereas rams do not.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is from August to January, though dependent on local conditions. The nest site is {{usually in the}} drooping foliage of a tall shrub or low tree, such as Casuarina, Melaleuca, Acacia, and mallee eucalypts. The site is sometimes near to or overhanging water, and the nest is usually constructed {{at the end of}} a drooping branch, suspended from twigs or foliage. The striped honeyeater often nests in the vicinity of a nesting butcherbird. It builds a deep cup-shaped or bag-shaped nest, with thick walls and the <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> the opening turned slightly inwards. The nest is made from thin dry grass and coated with plant down, feathers or wool, the coating often completely obscuring the grass framework. It is lined with spider webs, hair, wool or rootlets, and on occasion flowers and tissue paper. The striped honeyeater will commonly re-use material from previous nests.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, it was nature, not {{political}} maneuvering, {{that led to}} the filling of New Melones Lake. The winter and spring rainy season of 1982 was one of the wettest recorded in the 20th century. The Stanislaus River swelled to such high levels that it exceeded what could be safely released through the dam's outlets, and the reservoir rapidly surpassed the temporary limit. The winter of 1983 was even wetter and pushed water so high that it reached the <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> the emergency spillway (but did not flow over it), a level that has not been surpassed since. With the lake full, the state of California lifted the temporary limit in March, 1983. A deciding factor in the rescinding of the water-level limit was the prevention of $50 million in damages by New Melones Dam in 1982 and 1983, which demonstrated the dam's value for flood control.|$|E

25|$|St. Anthony Falls {{are made}} up of a hard {{limestone}} cap over soft sandstone. 10,000 years ago the falls were located near present-day Fort Snelling, Minnesota {{at the mouth of the}} glacial River Warren.
