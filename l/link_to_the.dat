5|$|Instead of {{continuing}} to use the side-scrolling perspective introduced to the series by , A <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Past reverts to an overhead perspective {{similar to that of}} the original. While A <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Past still uses mechanics and concepts from the original game, it also introduces new elements and innovations. For instance, arrows are now separate items, as bombs are in the original, instead of using a Rupee to fire an arrow. A <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Past also takes concepts from The Adventure of Link, such as the magic meter, which is used by items such as the Lamp. Control of Link is more flexible than in previous games, as he can walk diagonally and can run with the aid of the Pegasus Boots (Pegasus Shoes in the GBA version),although he cannot use the Pegasus boots diagonally. Link's sword attack was improved to swing sideways instead of merely stabbing forward; this gives his sword a broader range and makes combat easier. Link swings his sword as the default attack in future Zelda games, although stabbing is also possible in the later 3D incarnations.|$|E
