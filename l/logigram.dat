40|$|This {{software}} is a simulator of security system developed with Java {{and providing a}} graphic interface built with Java Swing. This simulator {{is bound to be}} used to check an existing system or a system being currently devised. A security system is represented by a <b>logigram.</b> A <b>logigram</b> consists of events linked by rules. The rules stand for triggering links between the events. The simulator provides a set of processes on security systems. Circuit search and useless rules search (subsuming rules) check the topology of the system. Two search through methods simulate the flow of triggering on events. The forward chaining stands for the simulation of the actual behavior of the system. The backward chaining looks for possible causes of the occurrence of an event. The simulator permits, thanks to those functionalities, the exhaustively check the design of a security system. Furthermore, the graphic display makes data handling user-friendly and ensures better understanding. Key-words: Simulation, <b>logigram,</b> resolution, forward and backward chainin...|$|E
