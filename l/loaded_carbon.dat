5000|$|In water {{treatment}} plants, organic halides are adsorbed using GAC or PAC in agitated tanks. The <b>loaded</b> <b>carbon</b> is separated using a membrane {{made out of}} materials like polypropylene [...] or cellulose nitrate. Measuring the AOX levels {{into and out of}} the treatment zone shows a drop in organic halide concentrations. Some processes use a two-step GAC filtration to remove AOX precursors, and thus reduce the amount of AOX in treated waters. A two step filtration process consists of two GAC filters in series. The first filter is loaded with exhausted GAC, while the second filter is loaded with fresh GAC. This set up is preferred for its increased efficiency and higher throughput capacity. The GAC is replaced cyclically and the extracted organic halide-carbon mixture is then sent for subsequent biological or chemical treatment such as ozonation to regenerate the GAC. Often, these chemical treatments, while effective, pose economical challenges to the treatment plants.|$|E
5000|$|A void is a pore {{that remains}} unoccupied in a {{composite}} material. A void is typically {{the result of}} an imperfection from the processing of the material and is generally deemed undesirable. Because a void is a non-uniformity in a composite material, it can affect the mechanical properties and lifespan of the composite. [...] Voids can act as a crack nucleation site as well as allow moisture to penetrate the composite and contribute to anisotropy of the composite [...] [...] This is an issue because crack formation and propagation can create unpredictable behavior in the laminate. For aerospace applications, a void content of approximately 1% is appropriate for performance while other grades of composites can have between 3%-5% void content. A small change in the percentage of void content may not seem like a large problem however for a <b>loaded</b> <b>carbon</b> fiber laminate composite, a 1%-3% increase in void content can reduce the mechanical properties of the composite by up to 20% [...] Void content in composites is represented as a ratio, also called void ratio, where the volume of voids, solid material, and bulk volume are taken into account. Void ratio can be calculated by the formula below where e is the void ratio of the composite, Vv is the volume of the voids, and Vt is the volume of the bulk material.|$|E

Carboxen 1012 (BET surface area of 1500 m 2 /g) powder exhibited the greatest maximum adsorption of ACT (up to 62 % by mass). The maximum ACT adsorption was correlated with surface area and porosity.

Calcium loaded chars were more microporous than potassium loaded chars. Iron loaded cellulose produced a Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) pattern with two linear regions.
