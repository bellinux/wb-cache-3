5|$|After {{finishing}} {{writing the}} dialogue, Takumi was called into another meeting with Inaba, {{and was told}} to add a new gameplay mechanic to the investigations. Takumi {{wanted to keep the}} gameplay simple enough for his mother {{to be able to play}} it, and keep it focused on the core concept of finding lies; according to him, he immediately had a vision of the psyche <b>lock</b> <b>system</b> during the meeting with Inaba, but still asked for three days to come up with an idea. He found it easy to formulate the idea, but it took over a month to create the system; the biggest problem was how to visually represent the psyche locks. Takumi also drew storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consisted of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening. He also drew rough sketches of cut-in illustrations; it was only decided after all the text had been written what scenes would have illustrations made for them. While the game's opening features the judge, it was originally supposed to have featured a demon instead; this was because Takumi was playing Devil May Cry at the time, and had liked its opening. As Takumi wanted the first three Ace Attorney games to be part of one larger work, he did not want the first game to look outdated in comparison to later ones, so it was decided to keep the same graphics for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth throughout all their appearances, and not make updates to them. The game's music was composed by Naoto Tanaka under the pseudonym Akemi Kimura.|$|E

25|$|The Willamette Falls Canal and Locks Company (later renamed Portland General Electric) {{was formed}} in 1868 to build a {{navigation}} route around the falls.

The locks opened on January 1, 1873, as the first multi-lift navigation locks in the United States at a cost of $560,000, and had been in continuous use until 2008. Maria Wilkins, a steamship, was the first vessel to use the locks. The Army Corps of Engineers purchased the <b>lock</b> <b>system</b> from Portland General Electric in 1915 for $375,000.

30|$|The main {{difference}} between analog and digital DLLs is the <b>locking</b> <b>system,</b> or {{sometimes called the}} control module as it is responsible for controlling the delay of the delay line based on {{the output of the}} PD.

However, in analog DLLs, a CMOS CP with an analog integrated filter is used to implement the <b>locking</b> <b>system</b> (Nuyts et al. 2014; Xanthopoulos 2009). Moreover, analog DLLs generally have smaller footprints as well as better delay resolution, linearity, and jitter performance than digital DLLs.|$|R
40|$|A passive {{decomposition}} {{framework for}} the formation and maneuver controls for multiple rigid bodies is proposed. In this approach, the group dynamics of the multiple agents is decomposed into two decoupled systems: The shape system representing internal group formation shape (formation, in short), and the <b>locked</b> <b>system</b> abstracting the overall group maneuver as a whole (maneuver, in short). The decomposition is natural in that the shape and <b>locked</b> <b>systems</b> have dynamics similar to the mechanical systems, and the total energy is preserved. The shape and <b>locked</b> <b>system</b> can be decoupled {{without the use of}} net energy. The decoupled shape and <b>locked</b> <b>systems</b> can be controlled individually to achieve the desired formation and maneuver tasks. Since all agents are given equal status, the proposed scheme enforces a group coherence among the agents. By abstracting a group maneuver by its <b>locked</b> <b>system</b> whose dynamics {{is similar to that of}} a single agent, a hierarchical control structure for the multiple agents can be easily imposed in the proposed framework. A decentralized version of the controller is also proposed, which requires only undirected line communication (or sensing) graph topology. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 2764507...|$|R

25|$|For {{the first}} time, in situ {{analysis}} of the atmosphere of another planet was performed and the data sent back to Earth; the analysis included chemical composition, temperature and pressure. The measured ratio of carbon dioxide to nitrogen of about 13 corrected the previous estimates so much (an inverse ratio was expected in some quarters) that some scientists contested the observations. The main station detected no radiation belts; relative to Earth, the measured magnetic field was 3000 times weaker, and the hydrogen corona was 1000 times less dense. No atomic oxygen was detected. All the data suggested that water, {{if it had been}} present, had leaked from the planet long before. This conclusion was unexpected considering the thick Venusian clouds.

25|$|Concord grew in {{prominence}} {{throughout the}} 18th century, {{and some of}} its earliest houses survive at the northern end of Main Street. In the years following the Revolution, Concord's central geographical location made it a logical choice for the state capital, particularly after Samuel Blodget in 1807 opened a canal and <b>lock</b> <b>system</b> to allow vessels passage around the Amoskeag Falls downriver, connecting Concord with Boston by way of the Middlesex Canal. In 1808, Concord was named the official seat of state government. The 1819 State House is the oldest capitol in the nation in which the state's legislative branches meet in their original chambers. The city would become noted for furniture-making and granite quarrying. In 1828, Lewis Downing joined J. Stephens Abbot to form Abbot and Downing. Their most famous coach was the Concord Coach, modeled after the coronation coach of King George III. In the 19th century, Concord became a hub for the railroad industry, with Penacook a textile manufacturing center using water power from the Contoocook River. Today, the city is a center for health care and several insurance companies. It is also home to Concord Litho, one of the largest independently owned commercial printing companies in the country.|$|E

500|$|After Portland was {{incorporated}} in 1851, quickly growing into Oregon's largest city, Oregon City gradually lost its importance {{as the economic}} and political center of the Willamette Valley. Beginning in the 1850s, steamboats began to ply the Willamette, {{despite the fact that they}} could not pass Willamette Falls. As a result, navigation on the Willamette River was divided into two stretches: the [...] lower stretch from Portland to Oregon City—which allowed connection with the rest of the Columbia River system—and the upper reach, which encompassed most of the Willamette's length. Any boats whose owners found it absolutely necessary to get past the falls had to be portaged. This led to competition for business among steam portage companies. In 1873, the construction of the Willamette Falls Locks bypassed the falls and allowed easy navigation between the upper and lower river. Each lock chamber measured [...] long and [...] wide, and the canal was originally operated manually before it switched to electrical power. Today, the <b>lock</b> <b>system</b> is little used.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel control {{framework}} for the formation flying of multiple spacecraft. With the passive decomposition, group dynamics of the multiple spacecraft is decomposed into two decoupled dynamics: the shape system representing the internal group formation shape (formation, in short), and the <b>locked</b> <b>system</b> describing the total group maneuver (maneuver, in short). Then, some desired formation and maneuver of the group can be simultaneously achieved by controlling the shape and <b>locked</b> <b>systems</b> individually.

By connecting all group agents via bi-directional controls so that slower agents are prevented from being left behind, the proposed scheme enforces a coherence among the agents as one group.
