5|$|Boisselier {{became the}} {{scientific}} director of Clonaid, an organization founded by Raël {{that sought to}} clone humans, in 1997. That year, Boisselier was interviewed by Le Monde about her role in Clonaid, and she lost her position with Air <b>Liquide</b> after the company learned of this. Air <b>Liquide</b> stated that her termination was due to her holding dual employment, {{and that she was}} strained by her Clonaid service. She filed a lawsuit against Air <b>Liquide,</b> arguing that she was the victim of religious discrimination. Her suit was successful: in 1999, she won a judgment of about US$30,000.|$|E
5|$|Brigitte Boisselier (born 1956), {{also known}} as Brigitte Roehr, is a French chemist and Raëlian {{religious}} leader {{best known for her}} claim to have overseen the creation of the first human clone. A native of Champagne-Ardenne, she studied chemistry in France and the United States, earning two PhDs. From 1984 to 1997, she lived near Paris and worked as a research chemist and a sales manager for Air <b>Liquide.</b> She embraced Raëlism in 1992; the group was unpopular in France and her conversion led to tensions with those around her. Five years later, she joined Clonaid, a Raëlian organization that sought to clone a human. After her service as their scientific director was publicized, she lost her position with Air <b>Liquide</b> and focused on cloning full-time.|$|E
5|$|Boisselier {{returned}} to France in 1984 {{to work for}} Air <b>Liquide,</b> an industrial gas company, where she remained for 13 years.

25|$|It was {{not until}} December 1942 that the demand valve was {{developed}} to the form which gained widespread acceptance.

Gagnan, employed at Air <b>Liquide,</b> had miniaturized and adapted a Rouquayrol-Denayrouze regulator used for gas generators following severe fuel restrictions due to the German occupation of France; Cousteau suggested it be adapted for diving, which in 1864 was its original purpose.|$|E

25|$|In 1942, {{during the}} German {{occupation}} of France, Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Émile Gagnan designed {{the first successful}} and safe open-circuit scuba, known as the Aqua-Lung. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure air tanks. Émile Gagnan, an engineer employed by the Air <b>Liquide</b> company, miniaturized and adapted the regulator to use with gas generators, in response to constant fuel shortage that was a consequence of German requisitioning. Gagnan's boss, Henri Melchior, knew that his son-in-law Jacques-Yves Cousteau was looking for an automatic demand regulator to increase the useful period of the underwater breathing apparatus invented by Commander le Prieur, so he introduced Cousteau to Gagnan in December 1942. On Cousteau's initiative, the Gagnan's regulator was adapted to diving, and the new Cousteau-Gagnan patent was registered some weeks later in 1943.|$|E

25|$|Pau {{experienced}} an important economic boom {{based on the}} discovery of the giant deposit of natural gas in Lacq. Discovered in the 1950s (by engineer Jean Féger), it was then the largest terrestrial deposit of gas in Europe and helped France to be self-sufficient in gas for almost thirty years. The Société Nationale des Pétroles d'Aquitaine (SNPA) was born at Lacq in 1941, after merger with ELF in 1976 it became part of the Elf Aquitaine group, then Total during its integration into the Group TotalFinaElf (in Lacq, known now the SNEAP, Société Nationale Elf Aquitaine Production). Oil and focussed businesses (Total Exploration Production France, Total SA, Total infrastructure Gaz France (TIGF), Schlumberger, Halliburton) and chemical (Arkema, Air <b>Liquide)</b> settled in Pau or the surrounding area (in Lacq at the Chemparc chemical park but also in Pardies and Artix).|$|E
500|$|Neon's {{scarcity}} precluded its prompt {{application for}} lighting {{along the lines}} of Moore tubes, which used nitrogen and which were commercialized in the early 1900s. After 1902, Georges Claude's company, Air <b>Liquide,</b> produced industrial quantities of neon as a byproduct of his air liquefaction business. In December 1910 Claude demonstrated modern neon lighting based on a sealed tube of neon. Claude tried briefly to sell neon tubes for indoor domestic lighting, due to their intensity, but the market failed because homeowners objected to the color. In 1912, Claude's associate began selling neon discharge tubes as eye-catching advertising signs and was instantly more successful. Neon tubes were introduced to the U.S. in 1923 with two large neon signs bought by a Los Angeles Packard car dealership. The glow and arresting red color made neon advertising completely different from the competition. The intense color and vibrancy of neon equated with American society at the time, suggesting a [...] "century of progress" [...] and transforming cities into sensational new environments filled with radiating advertisements and [...] "electro-graphic architecture." ...|$|E

The same year Air <b>Liquide</b> created a division called La Spirotechnique, to develop and sell regulators and other diving equipment. To sell his regulator in English-speaking countries Cousteau registered the Aqua-Lung trademark, which was first licensed to the U.S. Divers company (the American division of Air <b>Liquide)</b> and later sold with La Spirotechnique and U.S. Divers to finally become the name of the company, Aqua-Lung/La Spirotechnique, currently located in Carros, near Nice.|$|E
