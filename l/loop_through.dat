5|$|In 1953, {{the initial}} eastern bypass of Saginaw was {{built as a}} two-lane highway, and the former routing through {{downtown}} was redesignated Bus. US23. This bypass was upgraded in 1961 to a full freeway as part of I-75/US23, and the business <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> downtown was redesignated Business Loop I-75.|$|E
5|$|Business M-43 (Bus. M-43) was a {{business}} <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> the city of Grand Ledge. It ran east along Jefferson Street. The street curves to the southeast at {{a bend in the}} Grand River. M-100 merges in from the northeast at Bridge Street. The two highways ran concurrently south to Saginaw Highway. There, Bus. M-43 ended at the intersection with M-43 while M-100 continued south.|$|E

5|$|Business M-78 (Bus. M-78) was a {{business}} <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> the city of Lansing. It ran from an interchange between US27/M-78 and I-96 on the southwest side of Lansing along US27 (Lansing Road) into downtown. From there, it ran east on Main Street and north on Larch Street. At Saginaw Street, Bus. M-78 turned east to reconnect to M-78.|$|E
5|$|The routing of US223 {{was changed}} through Adrian in 1935, {{shifting}} the highway along different streets through town. Another change in 1942 through Adrian {{led to the}} creation of the first business <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> the city. This version of the business loop lasted until the main highway was moved a second time in 1956. With this subsequent move, the business loop designation was shifted to its current location.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} three business routes {{in the state}} of Michigan derived from M-numbered highways. The other two are in Hillman and Niles for M-32 and M-60 respectively. In the past, two other business routes for M-28 existed in Newberry and Marquette, but they have since been retired. The extant Bus. M-28 designation remains for the <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> Ishpeming and Negaunee.|$|E

5|$|Business US Highway 23 (Bus. US23) was a {{business}} <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> downtown Bay City. It started {{at the intersection of}} where US23 turned off Broadway Street westward onto Lafayette Avenue. From this point, Bus. US23 ran east on Lafayette Avenue for two blocks and then turned northward onto Garfield Avenue, running parallel to, but inland from, the Saginaw River into downtown Bay City. As it approached downtown, the business loop jogged off Garfield onto Washington Avenue. At the intersection with 7th Street, Bus. US23 turned westward to cross the Saginaw River. On the opposite side, the business loop followed Jenny Street westbound and Thomas Street eastbound along a one-way pairing of streets. At the intersection with US23 (Euclid Avenue), the business loop terminated.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway127 (Bus. US127) is a {{business}} <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> St. Louis. The highway starts at an interchange with US127 south of St. Louis at exit114. From there, it follows State Road northward through farmland into {{the southern edge of}} town. There, Bus. US127 follows Main Street through residential areas into downtown. At the intersection with M-46 (Washington Street), the business loop turns westerly along the other highway, running concurrently. The combined highway crosses the Pine River and runs through residential areas as it exits the town. As Bus. US127/M-46 approaches US127, it passes several businesses. The business loop terminates at exit127A near the northern terminus of the Bus. US127 for Alma.|$|E
5|$|Dating back to {{the early}} days of the state highway system, M-50 was first signed in the southeastern corner of the state in 1919. During the 1920s, the highway was {{extended}} to the Grand Rapids area and beyond to Lake Michigan, making it a trans-peninsular route connecting that Great Lake with Lake Erie. A rerouting of highways including M-50 through Grand Rapids in the 1950s created Business M-50 (Bus. M-50), a business <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> that city that lasted for eight years. Additional changes made during the 1960s rerouted M-50 to replace its business loop until the highway was shortened to its present western terminus south of Lowell. A pair of truncations in Monroe in 1996 and 2006 are responsible for the present-day eastern terminus.|$|E

5|$|I-96 {{has four}} related, {{auxiliary}} Interstate highways that connect the main freeway to downtowns and other cities. I-196 {{is a relatively}} long freeway spur, beginning at I-96 east of downtown Grand Rapids and heading west through downtown to Holland, and then south to I-94 near Benton Harbor. The unsigned I-296 connects I-96 north of downtown Grand Rapids with I-196 in downtown, and is signed as US131. I-496 is a <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> downtown Lansing, which I-96 bypasses to the south, and I-696 is a northern bypass of Detroit, connecting I-96 in Novi with I-75 in Royal Oak and I-94 in St. Clair Shores.|$|E
5|$|Passing through rural Osceola County and {{providing}} access to rural communities such as Le Roy and Tustin, US131 approaches {{the south side of}} Cadillac in Wexford County. At exit176, M-55 leaves a concurrency with M-115 and joins the US131 freeway around the east side of Cadillac. This bypass was built in the early 21st century and the old routing is now a business <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> downtown. M-55 follows the freeway to exit180 while US131 continues around the east side of Cadillac and north around the east side of Manton. The lowest freeway traffic counts along US131, 7,455cars and 709trucks in 2009, are on the northeast side of Manton, as the trunkline transitions back to a two-lane undivided highway before meeting the north end of Manton's business loop.|$|E
5|$|St Kilda is {{adjacent}} to the mangrove forest bordering Barker Inlet, part of the largest tidal estuary of Gulf St Vincent. Late in the 19th Century embankments were constructed through the mangroves {{in an effort to}} reclaim land for pasturing. With the construction of the banks of the adjacent saltfields maintenance of the embankments ceased and the mangroves began to reclaim them. One of these embankments is used as the beginning of a boardwalk through the mangroves which forms a 1.7km <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> the samphire saltmarsh flats and mangroves reaching the border between the ocean and forest.|$|E

5|$|There are {{currently}} eight business routes of Interstate 94 (I-94) in the US state of Michigan. These business routes connect I-94 to the downtown business districts of neighboring cities. These eight routes are all business loops which bear the Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) designation. These loops are former routings of I-94's two predecessors in Michigan: US Highway12 (US12) or US25. The westernmost BL I-94 {{runs through the}} twin cities of Benton Harbor and St. Joseph along the former routing of US12 and US31/US33 that now includes {{a section of the}} Lake Michigan Circle Tour in the state. The loops in Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Marshall, Albion, and Jackson were also formerly segments of US12 which were later designated as separate version of Business US Highway12 (Bus. US12) through their respective cities before becoming BL I-94s in 1960. The route of the business <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> Ann Arbor was previously US12 and then later M-14 before receiving its current moniker. The BL I-94 through Port Huron was previously US25 and then Business US Highway 25 (Bus. US25).|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 10 {{business}} routes of US Highway127 {{in the state}} of Michigan. The business routes are all sections of state trunkline highway that run through the central business districts of their respective towns connecting them to the mainline highway outside of those downtown areas. These various business routes were formerly part of the routing of US Highway127 (US127) or its predecessor in Central Michigan, US27, before the construction of highway bypasses. The southern two, in Jackson and Mason were previously parts of US127, while seven of the northern eight (Lansing, St. Johns, Ithaca, St. Louis, Mount Pleasant, Clare and Harrison) were originally part of US27, a highway which was replaced on its northern end by US127 in 2002. The business <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> Alma was once numbered US27A.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} six {{business}} routes of Interstate 96 (I-96) in the US state of Michigan. There are two business loops designated Business Loop Interstate 96 (BL I-96): one through Lansing and one through Howell. Both follow the old route of US Highway16 (US16), with appropriate connections to I-96. There are three former business spurs that were designated Business Spur Interstate 96 (BS I-96). One {{connected to the}} carferry docks in Muskegon, running concurrently with part of Business US31 (Bus. US31) along former US16, {{but it has been}} eliminated. The second spur ran into downtown Portland until it was decommissioned in 2007. Two routes in the Detroit area—a <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> Farmington and a spur into Detroit—both using Grand River Avenue, and meeting at the temporary end of I-96 near Purdue Avenue, were eliminated when I-96 was moved to the completed Jeffries Freeway in 1977. These Detroit-area business routes are still state-maintained as unsigned highways.|$|E

5|$|US131 {{runs through}} a {{business}} corridor {{along the west}} side of Three Rivers. M-60 runs concurrently along this part of US131 until the two highways meet {{the south end of the}} business <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> town. The main road curves to the northeast as it leaves town, and M-60 turns east to follow Business US131 (Bus. US131) into downtown. The trunkline runs parallel to a branch of the Grand Elk Railroad. North of the other end of the business loop, US131 follows a four-lane surface highway through rural farmland in northern St. Joseph County. The highway has at-grade junctions with cross roads, but otherwise has limited access from adjoining property. This arrangement ends on the south side of Schoolcraft, where the highway transitions to follow Grand Street through town. North of town US131 returns to an expressway as the highway continues through southern Kalamazoo County farmland.|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was signposted in 1919, the north–south highway through Saginaw {{was part of}} the {{original}} M-10. This highway was later redesignated as part of US23 when the United States Numbered Highway System was created in 1926. US23 was initially routed on the western side of the Saginaw River through the city, but it was moved in 1929 to run along the eastern side. In 1953, the initial eastern bypass of Saginaw was built as a two-lane highway, and the former routing through downtown was redesignated Bus. US23. This bypass was upgraded in 1961 to a full freeway as part of I-75/US23, and the business <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> downtown was redesignated BL I-75. In 1971, I-675 was completed, and BL I-75 was decommissioned through Saginaw. The segments of the business loop that were concurrent with M-13, M-46 or M-81 remained part of those state highways, but the rest of BL I-75 was returned to local control.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway127 (Bus. US127) is a {{business}} loop of US127 through Jackson that is wholly concurrent with M-50. Its southern end is at an interchange in a rural section of Summit Township. From exit34 on US127, the business loop runs north and northwesterly, crossing the Grand River. North of the river, the roadway is bounded by businesses as it runs along Cooper Street through residential areas on the southeastern side of Jackson. In the downtown area, Bus. US127/M-50 merges with Business Loop Interstate94 (BL I-94) and splits to follow a one-way pairing of streets that form a <b>loop</b> <b>through</b> downtown. Northbound traffic continues along {{the eastern side of}} this loop on Cooper Street and crosses the Grand River again. At the intersection with Michigan Avenue, BL I-94/Bus. US127/M-50 turns westward onto Louis Glick Highway around the northern side of downtown. The business loop crosses the Grand River a third and final time along Louis Glick. On the western side of downtown, the business loop angles southwesterly as Louis Glick Highway merges into Michigan Avenue. (At the same time, the southern half of the one-way loop, Washington Street, also splits from Michigan Avenue.) BL I-94/Bus. US127/M-50 follows Michigan Avenue westward through residential neighborhoods to an intersection with West Avenue, where Bus. US127/M-50 turns northward, separating from BL I-94 (Michigan Avenue). As the business loop approaches its parent highway, it transitions into a commercial area. The northern terminus of Bus. US127 is at the same interchange northwest of Jackson in Blackman Township where the US127 and I-94 freeways merge.|$|E
