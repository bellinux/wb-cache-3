40|$|Nursing care of {{restless and}} {{aggressive}} patients, despite the unstoppable progress, can hardly {{do without the}} use of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> in all cases. In order to provide quality nursing care and to ensure the patient´s safety even with the application of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures,</b> it is necessary to determine the level of professional quality, or the introduction of nursing standards at all wards where <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> are used. The aim of this thesis was to verify if the <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> in psychiatric inpatient units and inpatient wards of other medical disciplines are being used in accordance with the standard of nursing care of patients who are restrained in bed, and analyze the current standards of nursing care determining the use of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures.</b> Another objective was to find out nurses´ attitudes to application of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> and to survey their feelings while applying <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures.</b> On the base of the objectives hypotheses were formulated with regard to data in literature and my own clinical practice, which also includes the use of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures.</b> The nursing research was conducted through a questionnaire at the wards where <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> are applied. The respondents were nurses working in these units. The results provided clear evidence that not only worldwide, throughout Europe, but also within medical facilities of the Czech Republic, the care of psychiatric patients is inconsistent in terms of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures,</b> and therefore, standardization of this care is highly desirable.

40|$|Aim: Research {{suggests}} that <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> {{are widely used}} with adolescents with mild intellectual disabilities (ID). <b>Restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> are defined as all measures that limit the freedom of a person. We investigated staff perspectives {{on the use of}} <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> with adolescents with mild ID in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} current Dutch policies on reduction. Method: We surveyed a nationally representative sample of Dutch care professionals. 195 staff members working in settings providing care for people with ID filled out the survey (response 68. 7 %). Results: If there is danger, physical aggression or sexually abusive behavior almost all (87. 8 – 96. 8 %) staff members consider the use of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures.</b> The most often mentioned goals of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> are averting or avoiding danger (90. 4 % and 83. 0 %). Furthermore 63. 8 % of staff members use <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> to calm adolescents. Very few staff were able to express how they could reduce the use of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures.</b> Conclusion: Physical and mechanical restrictions are generally considered most intrusive, but the results show awareness of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> on pedagogical grounds (e. g. limiting the use of mobile phones and social media). Current policies do not address these ‘pedagogical’ measures, making staff members question the lawfulness of their actions.

This article addresses whether this increase was mediated by changes in belief {{about the effectiveness of}} <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> and belief about the harm caused by drinking. Method: The data were derived from five surveys conducted during the period 2005 – 2009 (N 7244). In each survey, we used identical measures of attitudes towards regulation of price and availability, belief in the effectiveness of such measures and belief in the association between overall consumption and harm. Results: During the period, there was an increase in support for restrictive policymeasures; in belief in the effectiveness of thesemeasures and in belief in the harm caused by drinking. Increased support for <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> was partly mediated by changes in beliefs in terms of statistically significant indirect effects from both belief in the effectiveness of such measures and belief in the harm caused by drinking. Half of the increased support for <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> could be attributed to changes in beliefs.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis elaborates {{the theme}} of ?The Health and Social Service Employees´ Views of the Problems Concerning the <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Measures</b> Imposed Upon Social Facilities Providing Accommodation?. <b>Restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> {{can be defined as}} a means used to restrict movement of the social services users. These measures can be applied only to the situations defined by Act No. 108 / 2009 Sb. *, on Social Services. This act stipulates even the precise procedure for the process of applying these <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures.</b> The theoretical part of this bachelor thesis is focused on the characteristics of the social facilities providing accommodation, their users and employees, on determining the <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> including the related duties of social service providers, as well as characteristic features of the dementia syndrome, since the person living with this syndrome are a target group of users of the social facility providing accommodation in which this research has been carried out. The main aim of the practical part of the thesis was to find out what opinion the employees carrying out professional activities had on the <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> imposed upon the Čížkovice Pensioners´ Home, which serves as an example of such social facility. The strategy of qualitative research has been applied to the implementation of the research, in particular the enquiry method and the technique of the half-structured interview. Afterwards the main research question was formulated. For answering this question three partial research questions had to be determined. They were focused on the degree of social employees´ knowledge of these <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures,</b> on the care for persons with the dementia syndrome and on the employees´ reaction to problematic behaviour of these persons. This bachelor thesis will be made use of as a feedback for the above mentioned employees, i. e. those carrying out professional activities in the Čížkovice Pensioners´ Home, where the research has been carried out...|$|R

40|$|The {{functioning}} of the European Union (EU) has been explored extensively in recent years. The dominant prism through which {{to look at the}} EU is still one of locus: i. e. whether decisions are made in the capitals of its member states or in Brussels. This debate is contained in the dualism between intergovernmentalism and supranationalism, but drawing the boundaries between the two concepts is still undone. This article attempts to contribute to solving this problem by investigating the <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> policy of the EU in order to identify three conditions under which intergovernmentalism should be used. First, when EU institutions are dependent on EU member states for information and expertise; second, when decision-making powers rest mainly in EU capitals; and three, when there are no exclusive fora for decision-making in Brussels. The study of the <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> of the European Union does not meet any of these three conditions; therefore the article argues that the concept of supranational intergovernmentalism offers useful insights to understand the EU security governance of CFSP sanctions. The article is divided into four parts. The first introduces the debate on security governance and justifies the selection of this specific approach to the study of sanctions. The second part presents the <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> policy of the European Union and justifies its pertinence to the field of security. The third part of the article investigates the emerging patterns in security governance by testing the three conditions on the decision-making process for EU <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures.</b> Finally, the conclusion summarises the main argument and indicates ways forward in the study of EU sanctions from a governance perspective...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The use of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> such as {{quarantine}} draws {{into sharp}} relief the dynamic interplay {{between the individual}} rights of the citizen {{on the one hand}} and the collective rights of the community on the other. Concerns regarding infectious disease outbreaks (SARS, pandemic influenza) have intensified the need to understand public perceptions of quarantine and other social distancing measures. Methods We conducted a telephone survey of the general population in the Greater Toronto Area in Ontario, Canada. Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) technology was used. A final sample of 500 individuals was achieved through standard random-digit dialing. Results Our data indicate strong public support for the use of quarantine when required and for serious legal sanctions against those who fail to comply. This support is contingent both on the implementation of legal safeguards to protect against inappropriate use and on the provision of psychosocial supports for those affected. Conclusion To engender strong public support for quarantine and other <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures,</b> government officials and public health policy-makers would do well to implement a comprehensive system of supports and safeguards, to educate and inform frontline public health workers, and to engage the public at large in an open dialogue on the ethical use of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> during infectious disease outbreaks. </p...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, the European Union (EU) has {{increasingly}} relied {{on the use of}} <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> in its external action; however, this has not been accompanied by an attentive evaluation of their effectiveness. In this Issue Paper, Francesco Giumelli and Paul Ivan focus on the case studies of Iran, Belarus, Syria and Myanmar (Burma) and explore ways of understanding the effectiveness of EU <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> by providing a framework for assessment which looks at: the role of sanctions in an overall foreign policy strategy; the purpose and goals of the policy in terms of coercing, constraining and signalling; the impact of sanctions and the costs incurred by the EU; and the sanctions’ comparative utility. After evaluating the four case studies, the authors argue that <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> positively contribute to shaping the EU’s external relations but {{that there is a need}} for a careful evaluation of what sanctions are supposed to achieve in order to build the proper expectations upon which their effectiveness can be judged. In order to improve the monitoring mechanisms of sanctions at the EU level, the authors recommend the creation of an EU panel of experts who would be tasked with monitoring sanctions, a measure which would enhance the evaluation of sanctions and could potentially improve the way in which they are integrated into the EU external action...|$|R

The vast literature on this topic in different fields, especially in International/nLaw, proves its relevance and complexity.

To analyze the efficacy of these measures, it is first important to understand their content, their purpose and their target.

Finally, the political and economic consequences need to be examined with regards to the purposes {{and the nature of the}} <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures,</b> which were designed to coerce and constrain, but above all to signal the position of the initiators and their rejection to the responsible actors’ actions.

The article aims to provide a legal assessment of these measures and their consequences from the perspective of international and EU law. The selected <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> employed by the Member States in relation to or post- 2015 refugee ‘crisis’ that are analysed in the article, relate to restrictions in the area of border controls: reintroduction of Schengen control at EU internal borders; physical barriers built along the borders of EU Member States and closure of external borders; other restrictions through legislative changes related to fast-track procedures and the increased use of detention. The research demonstrates that the <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> analysed have already caused and will raise concerns resulting in legal actions at national, as well as European courts, the latter being far less favourable to accepting the arguments of “unexpected migration flow”, protection of national security or public order as justification for such measures.
