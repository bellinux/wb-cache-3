40|$|Abstract. Recently the {{application}} of <b>lever</b> <b>cam</b> ass’y made of the high-functional polymer is increasing internationally to improve the productivity and weight reduction. But {{the application}} of injection molding of <b>lever</b> <b>cam</b> ass’y in our country is not reported yet {{because of the lack}} of the optimal selection technique of proper material and the optimal design of injection parameter. In order to solve the problem, the injection molding simulation is used. The modification of gate position and rib thickness was done and the parameters like injection time, injection temperature, packing pressure and cooling time were changed. As a result, the comparison between models was done and the optimal shape of <b>lever</b> <b>cam</b> ass’y was developed...|$|E
50|$|Ascender - These {{are used}} to ascend ropes. Devices that used <b>lever</b> <b>cams</b> were once used, though these have now been {{overtaken}} in popularity by toothed cam devices which slip less. A minimum of two ascenders are used, one attached to the harness at waist level, and another attached to a footloop and moved by hand. A third ascender may be attached to {{a foot and a}} ropewalking technique used.|$|R

50|$|Cam {{fasteners}} are {{a simple}} type of fastener that use a cam to push {{down on the}} webbing that is passed through the cam and prevent the webbing from slipping back through the fastener. The edge of the <b>cam</b> <b>lever</b> that faces the webbing is usually knurled to provide a firmer grip on the webbing. Tension is added by pulling the excess webbing through the fastener until the necessary tension is achieved and then releasing the <b>cam</b> <b>lever</b> to lock the webbing in place.|$|R
50|$|A {{quick release}} skewer is a {{mechanism}} for attaching a wheel to a bicycle. It consists of a rod threaded on one end and with a <b>lever</b> operated <b>cam</b> assembly on the other. The rod is inserted into the hollow axle of the wheel, a special nut is threaded on, and the lever is closed to tighten the cam and secure the wheel to the fork. Wheels equipped with quick release mechanisms can {{be removed from the}} bicycle frame and replaced without using tools by opening and closing the <b>cam</b> <b>lever,</b> thus more quickly than wheels with solid axles and nuts. On the negative side, a quick-release hub renders a wheel more vulnerable to theft and care must be taken to ensure that the mechanism is properly tightened.|$|R
2500|$|The Fulmer tension meter is {{a device}} for measuriing {{the tension in}} ropes and cables. A fixed length of cable is {{displaced}} at right angles using a <b>lever</b> and <b>cam.</b> The tension in the cable is arrived at by measuring the consequent displacement {{in the frame of}} the meter. [...] In 1971 Fulmer set up a joint company with the sponsor of this development and subsequently acquired all the shares. The meter continues to be produced and marketed by a successor company.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} design a new {{manipulative}} system with intermittent motion, an analysis of purely mechanical solutions with possibilities for adjustment of output displacement is performed. Solutions are chosen based on simple <b>lever</b> and <b>cam</b> mechanisms combined with one-way clutch. In order to evaluate those mechanisms for the proposed task a calculation of regulation characteristics for various mechanisms with different regulation parameter, different output motion interval and design parameters is performed. Attention is also payed on working coefficient change which occurs during the regulation...|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{machine guns}} use gas-operated reloading. A recoil {{actuated}} machine gun uses recoil energy to first unlock and then operate the action. Machine guns {{such as the}} M2 Browning and MG42, are of this type. A <b>cam,</b> <b>lever</b> or actuator absorbs part of {{the energy of the}} recoil to operate the bolt.|$|R
5000|$|A cam and groove {{coupling}}, {{also called}} a cam lock fitting or <b>cam</b> <b>lever</b> coupling, [...] {{is a kind}} of quick connect coupling usually used in industries as a hose connection to avoid leakage. This kind of coupling is popular because it is a simple and reliable means of connecting and disconnecting.|$|R
25|$|A counter faller {{under the}} thread {{was made to}} rise {{to take in the}} slack caused by backing off. This could be used with the top faller wire to guide the yarn to the correct place on the cop. These were {{controlled}} by <b>levers</b> and <b>cams</b> and an inclined plane called the shaper. The spindle speed was controlled by a drum and weighted ropes, as the headstock moved the ropes twisted the drum, which using a tooth wheel turned the spindles. None of this would have been possible using the technology of Crompton's time, fifty years earlier.|$|R
5000|$|The Flak 18 {{was mounted}} on a {{cruciform}} gun carriage. A simple-to-operate [...] "semi-automatic" [...] loading system ejected fired shells, allowing it to be reloaded by simply inserting a new shell into a tray. The gun would then fire, recoil, and, during the return stroke, the empty case would be thrown backward by <b>levers,</b> a <b>cam</b> would then engage and recock the gun. This resulted in firing rates of 15 to 20 rounds a minute, which was better than similar weapons of the era. High explosive ammunition was used against aircraft and personnel, andarmour-piercing and high-explosive anti-tank against tanks and other armored vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|The gauge {{consists}} of a beam, a headstock, and a scribing or marking implement, typically a pin, knife, pen or wheel. The headstock slides along the beam, and is locked in place by various means: a locking screw, <b>cam</b> <b>lever,</b> or a wedge. The marking implement is fixed to {{one end of the}} beam.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{original}} products designed and introduced by AGD, the 6Pak+ was a <b>lever</b> and <b>cam</b> operated 12-gram changer capable of holding six 12-gram gas cartridges in a spring-operated magazine and another in the gun adapter (seven cartridges total {{and the reason for}} the '+' in the name). Offered as an effective alternative to pump gun players who were unwilling, or prevented by tournament rules, to make the switch to 'constant air' (large capacity air tanks), the SixPak+ sold out its initial run upon being introduced at the Lively Masters national event. Today, this system is very expensive to buy and can rarely be found new.|$|R
5000|$|As the cam {{continues}} to rotate, the spring-loaded lever pushes on the pin {{to move it}} toward home position, but if the key is still down, the cam (now out of contact with the power roll) stalls because the projection on the cam catches on {{another part of the}} release <b>lever.</b> The <b>cam</b> stalls until the key is released. When released, the lever catches the projection so the cam is now in home position. This is like a simple clock escapement, and prevents repeated typing. (The [...] "key-down" [...] anti-repeat stop can be removed, so that fast repetitive typing can be done, but this change is difficult to undo.) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{modification}} {{has been}} made in the mating halves of a cam-and-groove hose coupling to prevent rapid separation of the halves in the event that the <b>cam</b> <b>levers</b> are released while the fluid in the hose is pressurized. The need for this modification arises because commercial off-the-shelf cam-and-groove hose-coupling halves do not incorporate safety features to prevent separation in the pressurized state. Especially when the pressurized fluid is compressible (e. g., steam or compressed air), the separated halves can be propelled with considerable energy, causing personal injury and/or property damage. Therefore, one purpose served by the modification is to provide for venting to release compressive energy in a contained and safe manner while preventing personal injury and/or property damage. Another purpose served by the modification, during the process of connecting the coupling halves, is to ensure that the coupling halves are properly aligned before the <b>cam</b> <b>levers</b> can be locked into position...|$|R
50|$|The Stringbike is {{a bicycle}} {{that uses a}} rope and pulley drive system instead of a {{traditional}} bicycle chain and sprockets. It uses two Dyneema ropes attached to pulleys attached to swinging <b>lever</b> and <b>cam</b> mechanisms, {{one on each side}} of the bike. These mechanisms replace the round sprockets found on chain-driven bikes. Unlike some traditional 10-speed gears using a derailleur, there is no slippage when changing gear ratios. The Stringbike uses a 19 gear ratio system with no duplicates and a total gear range of 3.5 to 1. The transmission ratio can be changed with a shifting knob located on the right-side handle grip. Gear ratios can be changed even when the bicycle is almost stationary.|$|R

50|$|Hot cutting is {{performed}} {{by means of}} a thermal torch (plasma or oxyfuel) and is mounted to the last axis of a multi-axis machine. The axes of the multi-axis machine are powered by electric motors and are synchronized to create a path for the torch and pipe that yield a desired profile. The synchronization of axes is accomplished either mechanically, via <b>cams,</b> <b>levers</b> and gears, or electronically, via microprocessors and controllers.|$|R

The resulting speed difference between mainshaft and reverse idler gear produces gear noise grinding. The reverse gear noise reduction system employs a cam plate which {{was added to the}} reverse shift holder. When shifting into reverse, the 5th/reverse shift piece, connected to the shift <b>lever,</b> rotates the <b>cam</b> plate. This causes the 5th synchro set to stop the rotating mainshaft.

50|$|The Valjoux 7750 uses a three-plane cam system, the coulisse-lever escapement, {{rather than}} the {{traditional}} chronograph mechanism, the column wheel. It is constructed of a mainplate, calendar plate, and chronograph top plate. <b>Levers</b> push a <b>cam</b> back and forth, driving the stopwatch mechanism of the Valjoux 7750. In the 1980s, many companies began using the Valjoux 7750 because {{it was easier to}} mass-produce and distribute in high-volume.

50|$|In contrast, {{desmodromic}} drive uses two cams per valve, {{each with}} separate rocker arm (lever tappets). Maximum valve acceleration being limited by cam-to-tappet galling stress, {{is governed by}} moving mass and cam contact area. Rigidity and contact stress are best achieved with conventional flat tappets and springs whose lift and closure stress is unaffected by spring force, both occurring at the base circlewhere spring load is minimum and contact radius is largest.Curved (<b>lever)</b> tappetsof desmodromic <b>cams</b> cause higher contact stress than flat tappets for the same lift profile, thereby limiting rate of lift and closure.|$|R
50|$|A camstrap is a {{piece of}} webbing with a buckle that is used to secure a {{cylinder}} or scuba tank to a buoyancy compensator or backplate. The name is derived from the cam action of the buckle to tighten and secure the strap. Also known as a cam band or tank strap. Cam straps are also typically used in whitewater rafting to tie rowing frames to the rafts. However, the cam buckle used in rafting cam straps is very different from one used in diving. The rafting cam strap has a self-locking <b>cam</b> <b>lever</b> that cannot be accidentally released. A thumb released cam locks the webbing in place and its locking action even allows tightening one handed.|$|R
50|$|The Valjoux 7750 is {{different}} from most other chronograph movements, using the three-plane cam system rather than the column wheel.

The Valjoux 7750 can be created in several different displays, including adding or eliminating a date window or adding or subtracting a subdial. Watch companies can purchase the movement and alter it in house if they desire.|$|R
50|$|In 1937 SIG {{licensed}} {{this design}} from the French and created their model SIG P210 Handgun series of handguns. When examining the Browning 1926 prototype, the French Model l935 and the Sig P210 is may be {{noticed that the}} slide mechanisms of all three appear very similar. Like the M1911A1 Colt pistol the breech locking mechanism {{was a series of}} grooves in the barrel which matched similar grooves in the slide which were <b>levered</b> or <b>cammed</b> upward to engage thus creating a locked breech action. Only after the slide and barrel assembly had recoiled due to the energy of expelling the bullet from the barrel was it possible for the link to pivot downward, tilting the barrel and unlocking the action. The velocity of movement as high enough to push the slide against its recoil spring to its rear most position. From there the spring was strong enough to push the slide forward, where it would strike the base of an unfired cartridge in the magazine which had risen after the breech block had moved rearward, thus pushing the unfired cartridge into the chamber, effecting the semi-automatic reloading process.|$|R
50|$|Early {{versions}} of the cam systems used a Gibbs-style type 1 ascender placed in an inverted position attached to a soloer's sit harness opposite to the manufacturer's intended use. The combination of a climber's body position in a fall and friction between the ascender frame and the rope provides the activating leverage for the cam to grab the rope. Fall forces generated using this device and the cam profile can be enough to damage a rope due to the high clamp loads induced by the <b>cam</b> <b>lever</b> arm. The main drawback to this system {{is that it is}} like the prussik knot system where the soloer also has to feed out an estimate amount of rope in order to reach a stance point.|$|R
40|$|The {{key element}} of robot is its gripper system, which can {{accommodate}} a variety of work pieces. Two finger grippers sometimes of <b>lever</b> type, <b>cam</b> type, gear type or mixed type are very common for many industrial applications. The present paper aims at the design and development of a four-fingered dextrous gripper with suitable electrical actuator system for transferring and transmitting flexural motions of the articulated fingers with suitable mechanical structures and tendons. Various hardware elements have been designed, constructed and evaluated for the dextrous hand. Each finger is having distal, proximal and metacarpophalangeal joints having three degrees of freedom so as to open and close with different postures for manipulating the objects with electric tendon actuation system. As a first step towards achieving pretension, optimal flexibility, high performance and well-behaved characteristics of the gripper, a multiple degree-of-freedom dextrous hand has been designed, constructed and evaluated. Various tactile and non-tactile sensors have been designed and mounted on the fingers with necessary control. During the execution of tasks, slip sensors provide information for grasping and manipulating the objects with certainty. The force sensors provide the magnitude of optimum force during grasping without slip. Thus the prototype gripper {{has been found to}} be capable of grasping the objects of different shapes with an optimal force...|$|R
5000|$|Thru axle - a {{removable}} axle with a threaded end that is inserted {{through a hole}} in one fork leg, through the hub, and then screwed into the other fork leg. Some axles have integrated <b>cam</b> <b>levers</b> that compress axle elements against the fork leg to lock it in place, while others rely on pinch bolts on the fork leg to secure it. Diameters for front thru axles include 20 mm, 15 mm (most common), and 9 mm. Rear axles typically have diameters of 10 or 12 mm. Most thru axles are found on mountain bikes, although some cyclocross and road bikes are using them. Thru axles repeatable locate the wheel in the fork or frame, which is important to prevent misalignment of brake rotors when using disc brakes. Unlike other axle systems (except Lefty), the thru axle is specific to the fork or frame, not the hub. Hubs/wheels do not include axles, and the axle is generally supplied with the fork or frame.|$|R
2500|$|The Isle of Man Examiner {{newspaper}} described Stanley Woods as an [...] "enthusiastic amateur" [...] {{and started}} the 1922 Junior TT with the number 40 entered by Cotton. After being delayed at the start to stop to recover dropped spark-plugs which had fallen-out of his pocket, Stanley Woods still managed to make good-time and lapped in 40minutes and 50 seconds despite clipping the kerb at Governor's Bridge on lap 1. At Sulby on lap 2, Stanley Woods slipped off the motor-cycle and continued but hit the same kerb again at Governor's Bridge which removed part of the exhaust. A fire in the pits at the TT Grandstand followed which was extinguished by pit-attendants and Stanley Woods using an overcoat. Further problems occurred at Braddan Bridge when Stanley Woods had to stop to re-place an exhaust valve after the inlet push-rod had broken.

5000|$|The {{sides of}} the can were marked with cross-like {{indentations}} that strengthened the can while allowing the contents to expand, as did an air pocket under the handles when the can was filled correctly. This air pocket allowed the container to float if dropped in water. Rather than a screw cap, the containers used a <b>cam</b> <b>lever</b> release mechanism with a short spout secured with a snap closure and an air-pipe to the air pocket which enabled smooth pouring (which was omitted in some copies). The interior was also lined with an impervious plastic, first developed for steel beer barrels {{that would allow the}} can to be used for either water or gasoline. The can was welded and had a gasket for a leak-proof mouth. The British used cans captured from the [...] "Jerries" [...] (Germans) — hence [...] "jerrycans" [...] — in preference to their own containers as much as possible. Later in 1940, Pleiss was in London and British officers asked him about the design and manufacture of the jerrycan. Pleiss ordered the second of his three jerrycans flown to London. After the second capture of Benghazi at the end of 1941, large numbers of Axis jerrycans were captured, sufficient to equip some units such as the Long Range Desert Group.|$|R
