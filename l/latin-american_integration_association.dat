However, its situation makes it a potentially economically and politically interesting region, because it lies in the proximity of USA, has ties to East Asia and is historically and culturally linked to Europe.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the EU and the Latin-American region belongs to the logics of interregionalism.

In this way, in a first moment, a conceptual panorama (from the academic implications of region, regionalism and interregionalism, among others) is offered. By {{the means of the}} documentary method, the existence of an EU’s interregional strategy and its possible Americanization was verified. The obtained results showed: the existence of the UE interregional strategy as well as its concretization in the negotiation of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) EU – CAN. The two major conclusions of this article were: First, there is a slight Americanization of this interregional European strategy. The second conclusion is that a deepening of the international presence of Europe as regional actor is observed. It means the deepening of the EU’s soft power. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this document is to establish if the UE {{can be considered as}} an actor of the <b>Latin-American</b> regional <b>integration.</b> The method of the current research is qualitative. The different aspects of the interregional European strategy for regional integration towards Latin America (E. I. S. R. I. – L. A.) are analyzed as follows. First, the discourse that places regional integration as one of the priorities of the given strategy is studied. Second, the economic actions responsible of materializing that priority are checked. Third, the political actions of the E. I. S. R. I. – L. A. are introduced. The results of the analysis make it evident that although EU appears to be an actor of the <b>Latin-American</b> regional <b>integration,</b> its influence seems to be restricted. Nevertheless, this affirmation should be relativized because this lack of influence can be due to an absence of mechanisms of measurement of results in terms of regional integration.
