In somatic mammalian cells, the majority of CpG sites are methylated. However, CpG sites located in regions of increased CG density, known as CpG islands, generally have low levels of CpG methylation [2]. On the molecular level, it is well known that CpG methylation leads to X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprint-ing, and suppression of transposable elements. Disrup-tion of DNA methylation patterns is associated with diseases, and particularly with cancer [3]. Key regulators that are essential for establishing and maintaining the epigenomic landscape are frequently mutated and can drive cancer development via alterations of DNA methy-lation and histone modifications [4].

During embryonic development of the mouse, <b>progenitors</b> of B <b>lymphocytes</b> arise in fetal liver at day 13 of gestation (1 - 4), then develop into precursor (pre) B cells, which consequently rearrange the gene segments of the sIg V regions ofHchains, followed by those of the L chains (5, 6). The early stages of progenitor proliferation and induction to Ig gene rearrangements have been found to depend on interactions with cells ofthe environment called stroma (7 - 15). At least in part, the effects ofstromal cells on B cell development appear to be mediated by soluble cytokines, notably IL- 3 or- 7 (16 - 21). Productive rearrangements of both H and L chain V genes allow the expression of Ig on the surface ofpre-B cells, detectable from day 16 of gestation onwards in fetal liver of the mouse (22). 2 d later, these slg+ B cells become reactive to polyclonal activators (1 - 3), so that upon stimulation with LPS, they develop into clones of IgMsecreting plasma cells, which can be detected in a plaque assay (23, 24).

40|$|Abstract Background Cigarette smoke (CS) is {{the main}} cause in the {{development}} of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the pathogenesis of which is related to an extended inflammatory response. In this study, we investigated the effect of low and high doses of gas phase cigarette smoke (GPS) on cultured <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells,</b> using techniques to assess cell viability and to elucidate whether cells die of apoptosis or necrosis upon exposure to different doses of GPS. Methods In our approach we utilised a newly-established system of exposure of cells to GPS that is highly controlled, accurately reproducible and simulates CS dosage and kinetics that take place in the smokers' lung. This system was used to study the mode of cell death upon exposure to GPS in conjunction with a range of techniques widely used for cell death studies such as Annexin V staining, activation of caspase - 3, cytoplasmic release of cytochrome C, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation. Results Low doses of GPS induced specific apoptotic indexes in CCRF-CEM cells. Specifically, cytochrome C release and cleaved caspase- 3 were detected by immunofluorescence, upon treatment with 1 - 3 puffs GPS. At 4 h post-exposure, caspase- 3 activation was observed in western blot analysis, showing a decreasing pattern as GPS doses increased. Concomitant with this behaviour, a dose-dependent change in Δψ m depolarization was monitored by flow cytometry 2 h post-exposure, while at 4 h Δψ m collapse was observed at the higher doses, indicative of a shift to a necrotic demise. A reduction in DNA fragmentation events produced by 5 puffs GPS as compared to those provoked by 3 puffs GPS, also pointed towards a necrotic response at the higher dose of GPS. Conclusion Collectively, our results support that at low doses gas phase cigarette smoke induces apoptosis in cultured T-lymphocytes, whereas at high doses GPS leads to necrotic death, by-passing the characteristic stage of caspase- 3 activation and, thus, the apoptotic route. </p...|$|R

Furthermore, we provide evidence that D � induces V L to J L rearrangements. During B cell differentiation, the genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the immunoglobulin molecules are assembled from germline gene segments in an ordered fashion (1, 2). Initially, a DH segment is joined to a JH segment in the heavy chain locus on both chromosomes. Subsequently, a VH gene segment is rearranged to the DHJH complex.

The reduction in the B-cell compartment included reduced percentages and numbers of pro-B, pre-B, and immature B cells in the absence of STAT 3, whereas the number of pre-pro-B cells was increased. We found that pro-B and pre-B-cell populations lacking STAT 3 were hyporesponsive to IL- 7 because of a decreased number of IL- 7 -responsive cells rather than decreased expression or signaling of IL- 7 R. Moreover, STAT 3 -deficient mice displayed enhanced apoptosis in the pro-B population when deprived of survival factors, suggesting that at least 2 mechanisms (impaired differentiation and enhanced apoptosis) are involved in the mutant phenotype. Last, BM transplantation confirmed that impaired B lymphopoiesis in the absence of STAT 3 was caused by a cell autonomous defect. In sum, these studies defined a specific role for STAT 3 in early B-cell development, probably acting at the pre-pro-B transition by contributing to the survival of IL- 7 -responsive progenitors...|$|R

Experimental animal {{studies suggest that}} bone marrow-derived <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> (PCs) also mobilize in response to sympathetic stimulation. Here we tested the effects of acute psychological stress and brief pharmacological β-adrenergic (βAR) stimulation on peripheral PC numbers in humans. Methods In two studies, we investigated PC mobilization {{in response to an}} acute speech task (n = 26) and βAR-agonist (isoproterenol) infusion (n = 20). A subset of 8 participants also underwent the infusion protocol with concomitant administration of the βAR-antagonist propranolol. Flow cytometry was used to enumerate <b>lymphocyte</b> subsets, total <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells,</b> total haematopoietic stem cells (HSC), early HSC (multi-lineage potential), late HSC (lineage committed), and endothelial PCs (EPCs).

Psychological stress also induced a modest, but significant, increase in total PCs, HSCs, and EPC numbers in peripheral blood. However, infusion of a βAR-agonist did not result in a significant change in circulating PCs. Conclusion PCs are rapidly mobilized by psychological stress via mechanisms independent of βAR-stimulation, although the findings do not exclude βAR-stimulation as a possible cofactor.

SDF- 1 alpha binds to the CXCR 4 receptor on cell surfaces and to heparan sulfate in cell membranes and the extracellular matrix. We hypothesized that SDF- 1 alpha is {{an important}} mediator of tumor vasculogenesis, recruiting bone marrow-derived endothelial <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> to tumors. We evaluated the role of SDF- 1 alpha in the adhesion of bone marrow-derived lineage-negative cells to the murine Lewis lung adenocarcinoma (LLCaB subclone), both in vitro and in vivo. LLCaB lung and liver metastases expressed significantly elevated levels of SDF- 1 alpha compared to normal tissue from naive controls and primary tumors. SDF- 1 alpha expression inversely correlated with tumor size, implicating involvement in early tumor development. SDF- 1 alpha was detected on ~ 30 % of blood vessels in primary and metastatic tumors by double immunocytochemistry staining and on endothelial cells within primary cultures of dissociated LLCaB tumors (DTC). Lineage-negative BMC enriched for Sca 1 +cKit+ (LSK) <b>cells,</b> including endothelial <b>progenitors</b> and CXCR 4 + cells, were used for subsequent adhesion studies. LSK cells preferentially adhered in vitro to DTC, compared to other target cell types. Pre-incubation with anti-CXCR 4 antibody or the CXCR 4 antagonist AMD 3100 decreased adhesion of LSK cells by 50 %. Biolocalization of adoptively-transferred EGFP-Lineage-negative BMC in tumor-bearing wild-type mice was evaluated by qPCR for the egfp-transgene. A significantly greater number of Lineage-negative BMC localized to metastases 2 - 3 days after intravenous injection than to adjacent healthy tissue, normal organs, or primary tumors. Control CXCR 4 -negative EGFP-dermal fibroblasts showed significantly less tumor localization. One-week post-injection, Lineage-negative BMC were still detected in every metastasis, suggesting that BMC were retained and/or had replicated.

Neither interleukin 5 nor thrombopoietin significantly altered the number or total cell content of blast colonies or <b>progenitor</b> <b>cell</b> numbers in blast colonies from those stimulated by SCF alone. No correlation was observed between total <b>progenitor</b> <b>cell</b> content and {{the presence or absence}} of either eosinophil or megakaryocyte progenitors in either type of blast colony. The data argue against a random process as being responsible for the formation of particular committed <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> or the possibility that lineage-specific regulators merely enhance survival of such committed <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> formed in developing blast colonies...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} supports {{the role of}} stem and <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> in vascular regeneration or injury. Following tissue ischemia, <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> are mobilized from their bone marrow or peripheral niches into circulation, adhere at sites of vascular lesion and differentiate {{into a variety of}} mature cell types according to their origin and the local environment. Impairment in this pathophysiological process due to either low numbers of circulating <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> or dysfunctional <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> leads to inadequate vascular repair and upon co-existence with different cardiovascular risk factors to vascular injury and atherosclerosis. Vascular repair is a complex process which includes mobilization, chemotaxis, adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells.</b> The common cardiovascular risk factors can impair this process resulting into inhibition of vascular healing and enhancement of inflammatory pathways which ultimately leads to atherosclerosis. Although homing of <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> into bone marrow has been extensively studied, domiciliation of precursor cells into peripheral tissues and differentiation into mature cells are poorly understood so far. Recently, the role of platelets in domiciliation and subsequent differentiation of <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> has been highlighted. Adherent platelets recruit circulating <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro and in vivo and induce differentiation of the latter into endothelial cells or macrophages and foam cells. Although further studies are needed to describe the mechanisms that lie underneath these observations, it seems that platelet interaction with <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> is an essential step in both vascular regeneration and injury.

In particular, endothelial <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> {{have been shown to}} have a strong influence on the growth of tumor blood-vessels. This finding was published in the journals Science (2008) and Genes and Development (2007) together with the fact that endothelial <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> are critical for metastasis and angiogenesis. A publication in Cancer Research (August 2010) confirmed the importance of endothelial <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> in tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. This seminal paper demonstrated that endothelial <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> can be marked using the Inhibitor of DNA Binding 1 (ID1). This novel finding meant that investigators gained the ability to track endothelial <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> from the bone marrow to the blood to the tumor-stroma and even incorporated in tumor vasculature. This finding of endothelial <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> incorporated in tumor vasculature proves the importance of this cell type in blood-vessel development in a tumor setting and metastasis. Furthermore, ablation of the endothelial <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> in the bone marrow can lead to a significant decrease in tumor growth and vasculature development.

40|$|Hepatocellular adenoma is {{a benign}} tumor {{of the liver}} that has a small but not {{negligible}} risk of malignant transformation into hepatocellular carcinoma. In analogy with the established role of oval cells in hepatocarcinogenesis in rodent models, human hepatic <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> may have a function {{in the development of}} liver tumors. To investigate this issue, we performed immunohistochemistry on biopsies of 10 consecutively resected hepatocellular adenomas using markers for hepatic <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells.</b> Sections of paraffin-embedded and frozen biopsies were stained using antibodies against cytokeratins 7, 8, 18, and 19, chromogranin-A, OV- 6, and neural cell adhesion molecule. Hepatic <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> were observed in five of 10 hepatocellular adenomas. These five tumors also contained cells with an immunohistochemical phenotype intermediate between hepatic <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> and hepatocytes. Hepatic <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> and intermediate hepatocyte-like cells were scattered throughout the tumors with a density that varied from area to area. Ultrastructural examination confirmed the presence of hepatic <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells.</b> Our study shows that hepatic <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> are present in a considerable proportion of hepatocellular adenomas, supporting the hypothesis that human hepatic <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> can {{play a role in the}} development of hepatocellular tumors. status: publishe...|$|R
