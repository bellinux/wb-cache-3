40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the plasma lipid-independent antiatherogenic effect of estrogen and <b>levormeloxifene,</b> a partial estrogen receptor agonist. 85 rabbits were ovariectomized and balloon-injured in the middle thoracic aorta. The rabbits were fed a cholesterol-enriched diet supplemented with 17 beta-estradiol, <b>levormeloxifene,</b> or placebo, either alone, or together with 160 microg/ml NG-nitro- -arginine methyl ester (-NAME), an NO synthase inhibitor, in their drinking water for 12 wk. Plasma cholesterol was maintained at 25 - 30 mmol/liter by individualized cholesterol feeding. In the undamaged aorta, the extent of atherosclerosis in the estrogen group was only one-third that in the placebo group. Simultaneous administration of -NAME, however, significantly reduced the antiatherogenic effect of estrogen (P < 0. 01). There was no significant difference between the placebo group given -NAME and the group treated with placebo alone. At the previously endothelium-denuded site, estrogen had no effect on atherosclerosis development, whereas -NAME combined with estrogen significantly increased atherogenesis (P < 0. 05). The effects of <b>levormeloxifene</b> were almost similar to those of estrogen. Active vascular concentrations of -NAME were demonstrated in an additional study, in which maximal aortic/coronary endothelium-dependent relaxation was significantly inhibited in rabbits given -NAME. Thus, in this study a considerable part of the plasma lipid-independent antiatherogenic effect of estrogen was mediated through its effect on endothelial NO in cholesterol-fed rabbits. The results for <b>levormeloxifene</b> suggest a common mechanism of action for estrogen and partial estrogen receptor agonists on atherogenesis...|$|E

It {{is available from}} [URL] Doi: 10. 1093 /molehr/gam 090 Metadata only entryFailure of ligamentous support of the genital tract to resist intra-abdominal pressure is a plausible underlying mechanism {{for the development of}} pelvic organ prolapse, but the nature of the molecular response of pelvic tissue support remains unknown. We hypothesized that the expression of genes coding for proteins involved in maintaining the cellular and extracellular integrity would be altered as a result of mechanical stretch. Therefore, cDNA microarrays were used to examine the difference in transcriptional profile in RNA of primary culture fibroblasts subjected to mechanical stretch and those that remained static. Out of 34 mechano-responsive genes identified (P < 0. 05), four were coding for regulation of actin cytoskeleton remodelling, and its interaction with the extracellular matrix proteins; these are phosphatidyl inositol- 4 -phosphate 5 -kinase (PIP 5 K 1 C), the human signal-induced proliferation associated gene- 1 (SIPA- 1), TNFRSF 1 A-associated via death domain (TRADD) and deoxyribonuclease 1 -like 1 (DNase 1 -L 1). The transcriptosomal changes led us to investigate the phenotypic consequences of stretch, <b>levormeloxifene</b> and estradiol (E 2) on the cytoskeleton of cultured fibroblasts. The percentage of cells with abnormal F-actin configuration was significantly higher in fibroblasts subjected to stretch compared with the static model (P < 0. 0001). <b>Levormeloxifene</b> caused similar significant alterations in actin morphology of the static fibroblasts. The use of E 2 did not reverse the process or protect the cells from the effect of stretch, but significantly increased the rate of fibroblast proliferation, suggestive of a role in healing process. Mechanical stretch and/or <b>levormeloxifene</b> disturb the fibroblasts ability to maintain the cytoskeleton architecture and we speculate that they may disrupt ligamentous integrity and result in clinical prolapse...|$|E
40|$|The high {{incidence}} of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) observed in postmenopausal women and in those used <b>levormeloxifene</b> suggested an aetiological role for the hypoestrogenic state. Further, the oestrogen-related molecular and structural changes in hip and knee ligaments, regulation of oestrogen action by extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and the high expression of steroid receptors in the mechanically failed connective tissue were previously reported. These observations led to the hypotheses of changed ECM composition with compensatory increase in steroid receptors expression in the prolapsed cardinal ligaments. A series of immunohistochemical studies proved {{the assumption that the}} prolapsed cardinal ligaments would have higher expression of collagen III (p= 0. 001), tenascin (p= 0. 001), oestrogen receptor α (p= 0. 09), androgen receptor (p= 0. 004), progesterone receptor (p= 0. 03), and lower expression of elastin (p= 0. 004) when compared to non-prolapsed ligaments, irrespective of menopausal status. Unpredictably, collagen I expression was directly related to the menopausal status rather than prolapse, and the prolapsed ligaments showed lower expression of oestrogen receptor β (p= 0. 02). HRT was assumed to rectify the prolapse-related changes in postmenopausal women, but it had only partial ameliorating effect by reducing collagen III (p= 0. 001) and androgen receptor (p= 0. 06) expression in the prolapsed ligaments to levels similar to the normal ones. Given the immunohistochemical findings, it was hypothesised that a number of genes representing the altered ECM proteins and gonadal steroids receptors would be modified. The stretch model was used assuming that the ffect of long duration mechanical stretch on primary cultures of fibroblasts derived from cardinal ligaments in vitro would be similar to the effect of chronic stretch associated with prolapse in vivo. cDNA microarray identified genes coding for regulation of actin remodelling, but it fell short of identifying alterations in gene expression commensurate with the findings of immunohistochemistry. This might be attributed to the differences between the in vivo and in vitro environment and/or the design of the stretch model used in this experiment. The cDNA microarray findings led to the hypothesis that mechanical strain e. g. in cases of increased intra-abdominal pressure and <b>levormeloxifene</b> could cause POP by destroying the cytoskeleton of the fibroblasts. To test this hypothesis, the effect of mechanical stretch and <b>levormeloxifene</b> on the morphology of the cytoskeleton of those fibroblasts grown in primary cultures was studied using fluroprobe technology. The effect of 17 β-oestradiol was also investigated assuming that it would prevent and/or reverse the effect of <b>levormeloxifene</b> and stretch. Stretch caused major phenotypic alterations in actin morphology (p= 0. 0001), and <b>levormeloxifene</b> caused similar changes in the static fibroblasts (p= 0. 0001). Nonetheless, the use of oestradiol did not protect the cytoskeleton, but significantly increased cell proliferation (p= 0. 02), which was reduced by stretch (p= 0. 001), suggesting a beneficial role in the healing process. By submitting this thesis and the publication of this set of articles, it is hoped that the area of prolapse will be opened up for further objective assessment of cell-matrix interactions, and additional opportunities for creative exploration will be catalysed.

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the differential effects of estrogen (E) compared to raloxifene (Ral), a selective estrogen receptor mod-ulator (SERM), following estrogen receptor (ER) binding in gy-necological tissues was conducted using gene microarrays, Northern blot analysis, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 activity studies. We profiled gene expression in the uterus fol-lowing acute (1 day) and prolonged daily (5 wk) treatment of E and Ral in ovariectomized rats. Estrogen regulated twice as many genes as Ral, largely those associated with catalysis and metabolism, whereas Ral induced genes associated with cell death and negative cell regulation. Follow-up studies confirmed that genes associated with matrix integrity were differentially regulated by Ral and E at various time points in uterine and vaginal tissues. Additional experiments were conducted to de-termine the levels of MMP 2 activity in uterus explants from ovariectomized rats following 2 wk of treatment with E, Ral, or one of two additional SERMs: lasofoxifene, and <b>levormeloxifene.</b> Both E and lasofoxifene stimulated uterine MMP 2 activity to a level twofold that of Ral, whereas <b>levormeloxifene</b> elevated MMP 2 activity to a level 12 -fold that of Ral. These data show that one of the significant differences between E and Ral sig-naling in the uterus is the regulation of genes and proteins as-sociated with matrix integrity. This may be a potential key dif-ference between the action of SERMs in the uterus of postmen-opausal women. estradiol receptor, female reproductive tract, mechanisms of hor-mone action, uterus, vagin...|$|E
