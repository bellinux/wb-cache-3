40|$|In this research, drying {{characteristics}} and product quality of Coulomb-force-assisted heatpump and oven dried <b>lemon</b> <b>slices</b> were studied. <b>Lemon</b> <b>slices</b> with 3 mm thickness each, were dried using oven and Coulomb-force-assisted-heatpump dryer {{with and without}} auxiliary heater at different drying conditions. It {{was found that the}} drying rate of the <b>lemon</b> <b>slices</b> dried by all drying methods showed only falling rate states, which indicates the drying kinetics were controlled by internal moisture diffusion. Oven drying of <b>lemon</b> <b>slices</b> at 60 °C showed the highest drying rate among all, followed by oven dried slices at 50 °C, Coulomb-force-heater-assisted-heatpump (CF-HT-HP) dried slices at 31 °C, Coulomb-force-assisted-heatpump (CF-HP) dried slices at 22 °C, oven dried slices at 40 °C and heatpump dried slices at 22 °C. The average effective moisture diffusivity value for the slices dried with these drying methods was found in the range of 16. 2 to 63. 8 ´ 10 - 4 mm 2 min - 1. In terms of quality assessment, CF-HP dried <b>lemon</b> <b>slices</b> retained the highest amount of Vitamin C as compared to the <b>lemon</b> <b>slices</b> dried by other drying methods. However, it retained relatively lower amount of total phenolic content (TPC) as compared to oven dried products. Among of all, CF-HP drying method produced dried <b>lemon</b> <b>slices</b> with the highest Vitamin C (6. 74 mg AA / g dry weight) whereas oven dried <b>lemon</b> <b>slices</b> at 50 °C preserved most of the TPC in the dried slices, which recorded as 13. 76 mg GA / g dry weight...|$|E

A soufflé cup is usually set {{in the middle of the}} platter of oysters along with a cocktail fork and a <b>lemon</b> <b>slice.</b> Often, the bottles of ketchup and other sauces are grouped together in stations every couple of feet along the counter, but in some oyster bars, patrons are served with their own ingredients.|$|R
