30|$|The {{sequential}} {{series of}} 46 total patients experiencing painful symptomatic total knee arthroplasty deemed revisable without a past medical history of {{an allergic reaction}} to a metal implant. Index implants included nickel containing devices {{from a variety of}} name brand companies including Zimmer Biomet, Smith & Nephew®, and Stryker®. Each patient was evaluated with anterior/posterior, lateral, and individual component spot view radiographs to assess for implant malposition, patients with concern for instability underwent stress radiographs to rule out ligament instability. Experimental subjects included patients whose findings were merely discomfort, swelling, instability including fibrosis restricting range of motion, or functional dissatisfaction without significant radiographic findings and were classified as “non-radiographic” meaning that these patients were unsatisfied with their implants without a specific radiographic cause. We chose for comparison this group of patients because we hypothesized that the unexplained, non-radiographic failure could be explained by an allergic response to the implant in the nickel sensitive group. 28 patients were assigned to the nickel sensitive group according to the results of an LTT demonstrating reactive nickel sensitivity. 18 patients had no to low reactivity of the LLT and were classified as controls. Those patients who demonstrated excessive wear byproducts by radiographically-significant polyethylene wear or arthroplasty usages of greater than 2  years were excluded from comparison, as high concentrations of wear byproducts may increase the background cellular reactivity of the CD 8 + cell line to overshadow the increase in the CD 4 + cell <b>line,</b> <b>masking</b> metal reactivity. 7 such patients were excluded in the nickel sensitive group and 4 were excluded in the control group.

40|$|Conclusion We have {{demonstrated}} that poor-quality etch masks on the InP wafer surface can be a cause of defective tching profiles such as vertical sidewalls and extra mask under-cutting.

Along a <b>line</b> <b>mask</b> defect, the downward etching process changes the v-grooves to vertical sidewalls without extra undercutting. For v-grooves aligned along the direction, defects on the etch mask give a signif-icant extra undercutting without changing the etching profile.

These deficits were unrelated to impaired visual acuity, impaired sensitivity to dot density, and differential positional uncertainty between the eyes of our observers. The deficits were also unlikely to be due to CSF losses due to abnormal low-spatial-frequency filters involved in detecting long chains of collinear dots. Instead, the results of simulations indicate that the inefficiency in utilising large numbers of dots is due to deficits of global, integrative processes in strabismic amblyopes. These simulations also show that while neither undersampling nor positional uncertainty of inputs into integrative processes can themselves account for the amblyopic deficits, if such abnormal inputs lead to the development of stunted integrative processes then impaired sensitivity to long chains of collinear dots is indeed predicted...|$|R

More specifically, photo-embossing is used to generate the relief structures and to generate a non-contact process without etching procedures which could eventually be applied in high-speed and continuous spinning lines. Typically, a photopolymer mixture consisting of a polymeric binder, a monomer and a photo-initiator is directly spun into a monofilament fibre. The rheological properties of the photopolymer mixture are measured, and it is shown that the photopolymer mixture is visco-elastic at elevated temperatures. Fibres are prepared from the photopolymer mixture, and surface relief {{structures are}} generated perpendicular to the fibre axis by photo-embossing using a mask exposure. Optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are employed to study the surface morphology of the fibres.

40|$|In {{this article}} we discuss the design and {{implementation}} of a novel microstrip resonator which allows for the absolute control of the microwaves polarization degree for frequencies up to 30 GHz. The sensor is composed of two half-wavelength microstrip line resonators, designed to match the 50 Ohms impedance of the lines on a high dielectric constant GaAs substrate. The line resonators cross each other perpendicularly through their centers, forming a cross. Microstrip feed lines are coupled through small gaps to three arms of the cross to connect the resonator to the excitation ports. The control of the relative magnitude and phase between the two microwave stimuli at the input ports of each line allows for tuning the degree and type of polarization of the microwave excitation {{at the center of}} the cross resonator. The third (output) port is used to measure the transmitted signal, which is crucial to work at low temperatures, where reflections along lengthy coaxial <b>lines</b> <b>mask</b> the signal reflected by the resonator.

Furthermore we discuss special numerical techniques like domain decomposition algorithms and high order finite elements and their importance for fast and accurate solution of the inverse problem.

40|$|The {{composition}} of a stimulus may affect how cues are combined. A thin luminance ring surrounding a uniform chromatic test facilitates contrast detection {{as much as}} a uniform luminance pedestal (Cole, Stromeyer & Kronauer, 1990, JOSA A, 7 (1), 128 - 140). This could suggest that there is a specific facilitatory relationship between luminance lines and chromatic edges that is not present in other combinations. Therefore, combining luminance lines and chromatic edges could also improve performance in edge detection tasks. Here we use a novel task, perturbation detection, target gratings were sinusoidally perturbed in space and subjects were asked to detect which of two stimuli was not straight. Perturbation thresholds, were measured for chromatic and luminance defined line and square-wave gratings alone and in combination. The introduction of a <b>line</b> <b>mask</b> produced increased thresholds in all conditions. However, the introduction of a chromatic square-wave mask improved perception of perturbation in luminance lines, whereas the introduction of a luminance defined square-wave mask has little effect on the perturbation thresholds for chromatic lines. This could suggest that when a luminance line is presented with a chromatic edge, such as the chromatic boundaries in a square-wave grating, the chromatic information becomes ‘tied’ to the luminance information. The perceived location of the chromatic edge may be determined by the location of the luminance line...|$|R
