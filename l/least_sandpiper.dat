5|$|Various {{insects and}} arachnids reside around the Petitcodiac River. Among them is the stonefly, the mayfly, the caddisfly, the simulium, the {{subfamily}} of tanypodinae, and the Hydracarina. Non-native species, such as the black-footed spider, the beech scale, the white-marked tussock moth, and the mountain ash sawfly have also made their home in the Petitcodiac River watershed. At the southern extremities of the watershed, 50 to 90percent of the world's semipalmated sandpipers feed on the mud shrimp at Shepody Bay. Around 269,445 stop there before migrating to South America, a number which accounts for at least 7.7percent of the total population. Among others, the semipalmated plover (around 2percent of the North American population), the short-billed dowitcher, the red knot, the sanderling, and the <b>least</b> <b>sandpiper</b> are also known for migrating through the Important Bird Area.|$|E

40|$|Many {{shorebirds}} are long-distance migrants and {{depend on}} the energy gained at stopover sites to complete migration. Competing hypotheses have described strategies used by migrating birds; the energy-selection hypothesis predicts that shorebirds attempt to maximize energy gained at stopover sites, whereas the time-selection hypothesis predicts that shorebirds attempt to minimize time spent at stopover sites. The energy- and time-selection hypotheses both predict that birds in better condition will depart sites sooner. However, numerous studies of stopover duration have found little support for this prediction, leading to the suggestion that migrating birds operate under energy and time constraints for {{only a small portion}} of the migratory season. During fall migration 2002, we tested the prediction that birds in better condition depart stopover sites sooner by examining the relationship between stopover duration and body condition for migrating <b>Least</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> (Calidris minutilla) at three stopover sites in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley. We also tested the assumption made by the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley Migratory Bird Science Team that shorebirds stay in the Mississippi Valley for 10 d. The assumption of 10 d was used to estimate the amount of habitat required by shorebirds in the Mississippi Valley during fall migration; a period longer than 10 d would increase the estimate of the amount habitat required. We used multiple-day constancy models of apparent survival and program MARK to estimate stopover duration for 293 individually color-marked and resighted <b>Least</b> <b>Sandpipers.</b> We found that a four-day constancy interval and a site x quadratic time trend interaction term best modeled apparent survival. We found only weak support for body condition as a factor explaining length of stopover duration, which is consistent with findings from similar work. Stopover duration estimates were 4. 1 d (95 % CI = 2. 8 - 6. 1) for adult <b>Least</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> at Bald Knob National Wildlife Refuge, Arkansas, 6. 5 d (95 % CI = 4. 9 - 8. 7) for adult and 6. 1 d (95 % CI = 4. 2 - 9. 1) for juvenile <b>Least</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> at Yazoo National Wildlife Refuge, Mississippi, and 6. 9 d (95 % CI = 5. 5 - 8. 7) for juvenile <b>Least</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> at Morgan Brake National Wildlife Refuge, Mississippi. Based on our estimates of stopover duration and the assumption made by the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley Migratory Bird Science Team, there is sufficient habitat in the lower Mississippi Valley to support shorebirds during fall migration...|$|R

40|$|Declines in avian {{populations are}} a global concern, {{particularly}} for species that migrate between Arctic-temperate and tropical locations. Long-term population studies offer opportunities {{to detect and}} document ecological effects attributable to long-term climatic cycles such as the El Ni~no/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In this study, we report possible population-level effects of such climatic cycles on shorebird species that use two non-breeding season sites in Ecuador (Santa Elena peninsula area, near La Libertad). During our 9 -year study period (1991 / 1992 e 1999 / 2000), there was a particularly strong ENSO warm phase event during 1997 / 1998. Population trend data for three species of shorebird, Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri), Semipalmated Sandpipers (C. pusilla), and <b>Least</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> (C. minutilla), indicated abundances gener-ally declined during the 1990 s, {{but there was an}} increase in the proportion of first-year birds and their abundance in the years following the 1997 / 1998 ENSO warm phase. There was some support for variation in apparent survivorship associated with the onset of the ENSO warm phase event in our population models, based on captureemarkerecapture data. Following the 1997 / 1998 ENSO event onset, individuals for all three species were significantly lighter during the non-breeding season (F 1, 3789 6. 6, p 0. 01). Least-squares mean mass (controlling for size, sex and day of capture) for first-year birds dropped significantly more than for adults following ENSO (first-year mass loss 0. 69 0. 12 g; adult mass loss 0. 34 0. 11 g, F 1, 3789 5. 31, p 0. 021), and least-squares mean mass dropped most during the period when sandpipers prepare for northward migration by gaining mass and moulting into breeding plumage. <b>Least</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> may have declined the most in mean mass follow-ing ENSO (0. 76 0. 19 g), whereas Semipalmated Sandpipers were 0. 52 0. 12 g lighter, and Western Sandpipers 0. 40 0. 13 g lighter, bu...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine how}} habitat use by {{sandpipers}} (Calidris spp.; Baird’s <b>sandpipers,</b> dunlin, <b>least</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> pectoral sandpipers, semipalmated sandpipers, stilt sandpipers, and white-rumped sandpipers) varies {{across a broad}} suite of environmental conditions, we conducted surveys at wetlands throughout the spring migratory period in 2013 and 2014 in 2 important stopover regions: the Rainwater Basin (RWB) in Nebraska, USA, and the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) in South Dakota, USA. Because providing adequate energetic resources for migratory birds is {{a high priority for}} wetland management, we also measured invertebrate abundance at managed wetlands in the RWB to determine how food abundance influences the occupancy and abundance of sandpipers on wetlands throughout the migratory period. To quantify habitat use, we surveyed wetlands every 7 – 10 days in both regions and visually estimated wetland attributes. Our results indicate that invertebrate abundance predicted occupancy, but not abundance, of sandpipers at wetlands in the RWB. The wetland vegetation characteristics that predict sandpiper occupancy are similar in both regions, but wetlands in the PPR support a higher abundance of sandpipers than wetlands in the RWB. Our results suggest that sandpipers make stopover decisions that balance local and regional wetland conditions. Managers should maintain the cues (i. e., mudflat) and ecological conditions beyond invertebrate abundance that predict sandpiper habitat use to successfully provide resources for sandpipers during migratory stopover if that is a goal of wetland management...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Conservation {{of habitat}} for {{flagship}} species, such as birds, {{aids in the}} protection of biodiversity in critical ecosystems. Extensive mats of macroalgae stimulated by nu-trient input to estuaries threaten critical successes in conser-vation made by legislation that reduces habitat destruction. Macroalgae can cover intertidal mudflats that are key foraging grounds for obligate visual foragers such as black-bellied plovers (Pluvialis squatarola), as well as foragers that rou-tinely switch from visual to tactile foraging such as <b>least</b> <b>sandpipers</b> (Calidris minutilla), western sandpipers (Calidris mauri), and willets (Tringa semipalmata), and predominately tactile foragers such as marbled godwits (Limosa fedoa). We hypothesized that macroalgae would affect shorebirds directly by altering foraging behavior and indirectly by reducing prey availability. Mats reduced visual foraging (pecking) for sand-pipers and marbled godwits and caused them to probe more often. Willets spent overall less time foraging than sandpipers and marbled godwits and did not alter their foraging strategy due to macroalgae. While foraging, black-bellied plovers, marbled godwits, and willets avoided macroalgae while sand-pipers did not select between habitat types. This suggests macroalgae may have negative effects on plovers, marbled godwits, and willets by reducing foraging area but that sand-pipers may utilize both macroalgae and bare sediments. Macroalgal mats indirectly influenced shorebirds by enhanc-ing variability in prey availability across the mudflat land-scape. By quantifying avoidance of or preference for mats, foraging behavior, and variation in prey availability, we showed that macroalgae have differential effects across shore-bird foraging guilds...|$|R

All of the winter finches on the Nebraska list (except for Hoary Redpoll) appeared, most notably Pine Grosbeak, represented by two birds. One of these was in the southwest (Kansas had several reports) but the other was in the east, suggesting either multiple points of origin, or, as suggested by some in Kansas, northern rather than western origin. Also in good numbers were Red-breasted Nuthatches, but Harris 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrows were scarce. Black-capped Chickadees remained in very low numbers in southern Nebraska west of the Missouri River Valley.

40|$|Williams, Christopher K. I {{conducted}} {{my research}} on Chickaloon Flats, Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, {{which is a}} tidal mudflats located along {{the northern part of}} the Kenai Peninsula in upper Cook Inlet, Alaska, 2009 ??? 2010. It is a protected coastal estuary stopover area along the Pacific Flyway, covering 7 % of the total estuarine intertidal area of Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. Almost one-third (23 of 73) of shorebird species recorded in Alaska use this stopover during spring and/or fall migrations. My objectives included 1) creating a current vegetation classification map and quantify vegetation changes from 1975 to 2005, 2) identify the driving factors of ephemeral pool presence, 3) document avian use of Chickaloon Flats during migration periods, and 4) conduct a multi-isotopic approach to estimate probable breeding and/or wintering origins of six species of shorebirds using Chickaloon during spring and fall migration of 2009 and 2010. I analyzed Hydrogen (dD), Carbon (d 13 C), and Nitrogen (d 15 N) isotopes from feathers and performed a likelihood-based assignment to inform North American (NA) and South American (SA) origins of six shorebird species. Only lesser yellowlegs feathers (Tringa flavipes) indicated wintering (n= 4, coastal SA) and breeding (n= 26, central Alaska) ranges. Estimated wintering ranges for <b>least</b> <b>sandpipers</b> (Calidris minutilla, n= 13) occurred in southern NA to northern SA, long-billed dowitchers (Limnodromus scolopaceus, n= 8) occurred in Mexico, and pectoral sandpipers (Calidris melanotos, n= 11) occurred in northeastern SA. Estimated breeding ranges for greater yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca, n= 67) occurred in southwest Alaska, and short-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus caurinus, n= 26) occurred in south-central Alaska. The analysis of stable isotopes to infer molt origins of birds is a useful and important tool in migration and conservation studies. I determined probable origins of long-distance shorebird migrants, some of high conservation concern, using an Alaskan stopover site, which identified habitats and previously unknown areas used by Alaskan breeding shorebirds. I observed 95 bird species throughout the spring and fall of 2009 and 2010, with 26 of those species breeding on Chickaloon. I observed several pulses of total birds during spring migration, and a more protracted fall migration with variable smaller pulses of birds. Estimated maximum daily shorebird numbers are 5, 638 during spring migration, and 20, 297 during fall migration. I created a recent vegetation classification of 7 vegetation types on Chickaloon Flats using 2005 Landsat TM imagery. I also quantified change of 3 mud/vegetation cover types from 1975 ??? 2005. The vegetated community type remained relatively stable over the 30 -year period, while the mud and mixed mud/vegetation cover types closest to Cook Inlet showed a relatively-small amount of change over time. The greatest change was an increase in mud area, indicating that the vegetated areas of Chickaloon may be slowly converting to a less productive mud community type. My research highlights the overall importance and value of Chickaloon Flats as a stopover and breeding grounds for a diversity of avian species, and long-distance migrant shorebirds in particular.
