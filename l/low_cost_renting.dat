One of his most interesting contributions was his scheme for abolishing slum areas, written in 1935. Boot proposed two new satellite towns comprising around 50,000 houses and re-housing around 250,000 people; one was to be near Waltham Abbey and the other near Dagenham. The transport proposed for the new towns was the “Railplane” the technical description sounding like the ill-fated Bennie Railplane. Sadly, neither the new towns nor the Railplane came to pass.|$|R

To meet the challenge of these <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> airlines, several ‘legacy’ or full service carriers (FSCs) around the world have created their own <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> subsidiary. The most notable example in the UK was Go, initially a <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> subsidiary of British Airways (BA) that was subsequently sold to its senior management team and then bought by easyJet, the UK's leading <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> airline. For <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> subsidiaries to survive and prosper, ‘matching’ models of human resource management (HRM) predict that they need to create a <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> employment system, which will be very {{different from that of the}} parent company. However, cost is only one variable in the competitive equation. In a ‘customer facing’ industry such as civil aviation a minimum level of service quality is also required and there is clearly scope for ‘low frills’ (e. g. Southwest Airlines) as opposed to ‘no frills’ (e. g. Ryanair). Moreover, there is always the danger that (well organized) employee groups will take umbrage at walking the ‘low road’ of employee relations, especially when their colleagues in the parent airline are walking the ‘high road’. Although competing head on with well-established <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> airlines such as Ryanair and easyJet, Go was able to forge a distinctive management style that combined <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> operations with high road employment relations.

Traditional “legacy“ carriers have been challenged by new no/low-frills, <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> carriers. While these new airlines have a relatively long history in North America, more recently they successively emerged in markets such as Europe, Asia, Oceania and Africa. The business model of <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> carriers has revolutionized air travel, and both media and academics paid ample attention to these in America and Europe.

However, {{for the most part}} <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> carriers have only operated on short haul routes. This paper carries out a qualitative assessment on the <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> short haul business model and a quantitative analysis on whether or not it can be successfully transferred to the long haul market. Taking Ryanair {{as an example of a}} very successful <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> short haul carrier, this dissertation develops a feasibility study, including a profitability analysis, on the applicability of Ryanair’s <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> short haul model to a long haul route. The results of this research show that some but not all of the main elements of the <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> carrier model can be successfully transferred to long haul airline operations. The results highlight that the move for a <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> carrier, in this instance Ryanair, to long haul operations appears to require substantial cost reduction, a large injection of capital and considerable cultural change. Another important finding of the study is that if Ryanair were to move to long haul operations it would no longer be able to adhere as rigidly to the <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> carrier model. Instead the evidence suggests that it would probably be transformed into a type of hybrid model between a full service and <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> carrier, such as a network specialist, product specialist or pricing specialist.
