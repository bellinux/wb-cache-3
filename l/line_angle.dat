25|$|Drifting {{competitions}} {{are judged}} based on <b>line,</b> <b>angle,</b> speed, style and show factor. Line involves taking the correct line, {{which is usually}} announced beforehand by judges. The show factor is based on many things, such {{as the amount of}} smoke, how close the car is to the wall or designated clipping point, and the crowd's reaction. Angle is the angle of a car and more importantly the turned wheels in a drift, speed is the speed entering a turn, the speed through a turn, and the speed exiting the turn; faster is better. Style is scored on a combination of a rate-to-angle during the initiation, how fluid the car looks through the course, and how committed the driver is through the course. The rate-to-angle is how quickly during initiation or Furidashi (振り出し:starting point) and transitions or Furikaeshi (振替し:transfer) a car gets to its sliding angle. Fluidity is how smoothly a driver maneuvers their car around the course, taking into account the amount of correction that a driver applies through the turn(s), and the smoothness with which the car transitions from one corner to the next. Commitment is about how much throttle the driver applies, and the confidence and dedication the driver shows when approaching track edges and barriers. That is the quicker the driver is able to come to angle, the more speed and angle they can carry through the course, the fewer corrections they apply through the course and the closer they drive to the track edges or barriers, the higher the style score.|$|E

Jarrett later pinned Eric Young in order to qualify for the King of the Mountain match, however Young attacked Jarrett after the match in storyline. The following week, Jarrett called out Young and offered to turn the other cheek, but instead Young provoked him by saying that he pays more attention to wrestling than his own daughters just like his father Jerry which resulted in Jarrett slapping Young and assaulting him. Jarrett also would accidentally punch referee Earl Hebner while Hebner was trying to separate the two. On the June 11 episode of Impact!, Mick Foley kayfabe fined and suspended Jarrett and threw him out of the arena as a punishment. The following week, Foley threw a party for Jarrett and welcomed his return to TNA in order to have him on his side at Slammiversary. At Slammiversary, Jarrett refused to give Foley the belt in the King of the Mountain match, which was won by Kurt Angle after assistance from Samoa Joe. Shortly after Slammiversary, Jarrett once again disappeared from TNA programming. During his hiatus, it was reported that Jarrett had lost all of his backstage power in TNA and would return only as a wrestler.|$|E

5000|$|Qualifying is {{then held}} with the {{competitors}} allowed two passes to try {{qualify for the}} Top 32 competition. The drivers are judged based on <b>line,</b> <b>angle,</b> and style. Line involves taking a predetermined line set by the judges at drivers briefing. The line generally includes apexing each corner, or [...] "inside clip", and may include [...] "outside clip" [...] points. The closer to these points, the higher the line score. Angle means maintaining an aggressive angle throughout the judged section and aggressive direction switches (aka transitions). Style refers to how aggressive the driving is during the run, the amount of smoke produced, how hard the car is pushed and {{the presentation of the}} vehicle.|$|E

50|$|Compasses on sailboats {{may have}} {{additional}} lubber lines at forty-five {{degrees from the}} centerline. This represents about {{as close to the}} wind as the average boat will sail. These lubber lines may be used when sailing close hauled to see if you are on the closest course to your destination, without having to add or subtract the 45 degrees every few minutes, or recalculate your required heading every time you tack. The main line on the compass reads your current (close-hauled) heading and the leeward lubber line will read the bearing to your destination, regardless of whether you are on port or starboard tack. Lubber lines also help you to see windshifts when racing. If you are sailing close-hauled with good trim and you notice that your bearing to the windward mark starts to drift outside the lubber <b>line</b> (<b>angle</b> becoming greater than 45 degrees) you are being headed, and should consider tacking.|$|E
5000|$|In Book VII Euclid introduces, {{as another}} type of {{magnitude}} alongside his geometric ones of <b>line,</b> <b>angle</b> and figure, the concept of “arithmos”. This is {{to be understood as}} “a multitude of units” where a unit is “that by which we call something a one”. With some reservations about the status of singletons and the empty set, the Greek notion of “arithmos” is thus essentially the modern notion of “set”. Mayberry notes that it struck him with the force of a revelation that the significance of Euclid’s Common Notion 5, - “the whole is greater than the part” - when applied to arithmoi is that an arithmos cannot be congruent, where this word is understood following Heath as “can be placed upon with an exact fit”, to any proper part of itself, or, in other words, that a set is finite in the modern sense of there being no 1-1 correspondence between the set and a proper subset of itself. The fact that Greek arithmetic, and in particular Euclid Books VII-IX, is really the study of finite sets has been obscured by the ubiquitous translation of “arithmos” as “number” and the transformation in the notion of number from its original “arithmos” meaning to [...] "ratio" [...] that occurred in the 17th century. The transformation in meaning was given clear expression by Newton in his Lectures.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an elementary {{analysis on the}} difference and similarity between upslope fire and jump fire, {{by a series of}} experiments performed in laboratory. The rate of spread (ROS), fire <b>line</b> <b>angle</b> (separation angle of the two fire lines), angular velocity of fire line, flame residence time and non-dimensional radiant heat transfer for the two kinds of phenomena are investigated. For upslope fire, it is found that ROS remains almost steady for line ignition, while it increases with time for point ignition. For upslope fires with line ignition, the fire <b>line</b> <b>angle</b> decreases with time from the initial 180 o to a steady small value, while for point ignition, the initially generated fire <b>line</b> <b>angle</b> remains steady. The angular velocity of fire line does not depend on slope angle in an upslope fire with line ignition. For jump fire, the ROS first increases sharply and then decreases gradually, and it depends on slope angle more significantly than the initial fire <b>line</b> <b>angle.</b> The fire <b>line</b> <b>angle</b> increases with time, and the angular velocity of fire line varies with slope angle. For upslope fires with line ignition, the flame residence time increases with slope angle, while it remains almost constant for upslope tests with point ignition. For jump fire, under one specific initial fire <b>line</b> <b>angle,</b> the overall mean residence time increases with increasing slope angle. Non-dimensional heat radiation for fuel preheating is calculated which effectively explains the ROS development in upslope fire with line ignition and jump fire...|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} supposed {{that there is}} a single, hierarchically organized pathway dedicated to form processing, in which complex forms are elaborated from simpler ones, beginning with the orientation-selective cells of V 1. In this psychophysical study, we undertook to test another hypothesis, namely that the brain’s visual form system consists of multiple parallel systems and that complex forms are other than the sum of their parts. Inspired by imaging experiments which show that forms of increasing perceptual complexity (<b>lines,</b> <b>angles</b> and rhombuses) constituted from the same elements (lines) activate the same visual areas (V 1, V 2 and V 3) with the same intensity and latency (Shigihara and Zeki, 2013; 2014), we used backward masking to test the supposition that these forms are processed in parallel. We presented subjects with <b>lines,</b> <b>angles</b> and rhombuses as different target-mask pairs. Evidence in favour of our supposition would be if masking is the most effective when target and mask are processed by the same system and least effective when they are processed in different systems. Our results showed that rhombuses were strongly masked by rhombuses but only weakly masked by <b>lines</b> or <b>angles,</b> but <b>angles</b> and <b>lines</b> were well masked by each other. The relative resistance of rhombuses to masking by low-level forms like <b>lines</b> and <b>angles</b> suggests that complex forms like rhombuses may be processed in a separate parallel system, whereas <b>lines</b> and <b>angles</b> are processed in the same one...|$|R

40|$|Background/purpose: In the {{fabrication}} of casting post and core or inlay the <b>line</b> <b>angle</b> of the cavity floor {{can be seen}} even when the internal axial walls are parallel or slightly convergent. It is conceivable that more sighted distance will be required for internal axial walls evaluation compared with external axial walls evaluation. The aim {{of the study is}} to derive a practical and convenient method and data for the evaluation of the divergent angle of internal axial walls. Materials and methods: Through a scientific analysis, this study derived a practical and convenient method and data for the evaluation of the divergent angle of internal axial walls. The sighted distance between occlusal <b>line</b> <b>angle</b> and the cavity floor <b>line</b> <b>angle</b> at 30 -cm distance was calculated by an established formula and expressed in 6 °, 12 °, and 18 ° of internal axial walls divergent angle respectively. Results: Tables 1 – 3 show the value of sighted distance with cavities of 6 °, 12 °, and 18 ° tapering. Based on the data, if more divergent angle is prepared; more sighted distance will be observed. Conclusion: Compared with the teeth preparation of external axial wall in a single crown, the sighted distance at 30 -cm distance in the internal axial wall is 1. 5  × wider. More sighted distances are required to prevent undesired undercuts...|$|E
40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the trochanteric fracture line in terms of the fracture <b>line</b> <b>angle</b> and anatomical location. METHODS: The preoperative AP radiographs of 164 randomly selected patients with trochanteric fractures were obtained. Measurements were made of: (1) the angle between the mid-shaft femoral axis and the fracture line, (2) the intersection point of the fracture line with the greater trochanter. RESULTS: An increase in comminution correlated with an increased fracture <b>line</b> <b>angle.</b> The angle of the fracture line relative to the femoral shaft showed a mean of 43 º (SD 10), but a range from 19 º to 146 º. DISCUSSION: This study provides information on the fracture line properties of trochanteric fractures and demonstrates a massive range in fracture line inclination and fragment size. Theoretical Engineering modelling studies have indicated that the measurements described in this study will have a major bearing on fracture stability. These findings can be applied to improve classifications for stable and unstable trochanteric fractures...|$|E

The present study examined the impact of two methodological factors (the angle size of the stimulus and the participant’s gender) on deviations of the SVV caused by head tilt. Forty healthy participants (20 men and 20 women) were asked to make visual vertical adjustments of a light bar with their head held vertically or roll-tilted by 30 ° to the left or to the right. <b>Line</b> <b>angle</b> sizes of 0. 95 ° and 18. 92 ° were presented. Results: The SVV tended to move in the direction of head tilt in women but away from the direction of head tilt in men. Moreover, the head-tilt effect was also modulated by the stimulus ’ angle size. The large angle size led to deviations in the direction of head-tilt, whereas the small angle size had the opposite effect.
