40|$|The {{conventional}} {{understanding of}} the <b>liaison</b> <b>interpreter</b> views the professional as a language broker between two or more individuals not speaking the same language. The manner in which this language gap is bridged, according to the conventional understanding, is through copying verbatim what is said in one language (the source language) and pasting it (into the target language). The conventional {{understanding of the}} profession and its professionals neglects the multi-faceted nature of the profession along with the many challenges with which its professionals are faced. A <b>liaison</b> <b>interpreter</b> is a professional who forms a bridge between languages, people and culture. When viewed through this lens, new meaning and understanding are gained regarding {{the work of the}} <b>liaison</b> <b>interpreter</b> whilst, similarly, unveiling the complexity of the profession. As such, new questions may be raised pertaining {{to the role of the}} <b>liaison</b> <b>interpreter</b> in dialogue settings. This mini-dissertation seeks to shed new light on an age old profession whilst unveiling these hidden factors to highlight the benefits of factoring cultural training into interpreter training to better train student interpreters, and equip them with a unique set of skills to assist them in overcoming the unique set of challenges with which liaison interpreters often grapple.

40|$|Intercultural {{communication}} is by nature a complex activity. In a multilingual society like ours, it will inevitably {{surface in the}} health care sector. The services of an interpreter are often considered to break the impasse in this communication process. The communication problem between the two parties, the service provider and client/ patient, is often {{not simply a matter of}} language but societal factors of which the <b>liaison</b> <b>interpreter</b> should be aware of also plays a major role for effective extended communication. This article focuses on some of the problems in rendering an oral source text in multilingual and multicultural societies such as South Africa in which there are heterogeneous target audiences for interpreting. It is pointed out that interpreters in such societies must take into account the heterogeneity of the target audiences, or otherwise interpreting will only be symbolic gestures, empty of value, and thus not communicate the message intended. In the process the limitations of the interpreter and how the presence of the interpreter can be facilitated, is also highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the end of}} the sixties, {{numerous}} Japanese contractors {{have been}} active in heavy industry work in Algeria and other North African countries. This has opened a large market for Japanese-French <b>liaison</b> <b>interpreters.</b> Such interpreters are hired by specialized agencies in Europe and Japan. With one or two exceptions, they are Japanese nationals. Most of them are young and have no previous experience as interpreters. Neither are they properly briefed before they are sent to the site, but they become proficient in their work with experience. Their tasks range from interpreting at various levels to translation and even participation in negotiations and report drafting. Material working conditions are comparatively good, but the duration of contracts is short and long-term stability of employment is uncertain. The precariousness of interpreting jobs and the temporary nature of the Japanese companies' contracting work in North Africa make this activity a provisional and highly volatile one. Japanese <b>liaison</b> <b>interpreters</b> in North Africa do not feel like professional interpreters and do not aspire to become professionals...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{interactional}} management of question-answer sequences in interpreter-mediated business encounters and discusses didactic applications for interpreter training. A close analysis of transcripts from authentic audiotaped data reveals how the turn-taking {{system in the}} translational mode is particularized to contextual needs, i. e., as talk progresses, the business partners, rather than addressing one another, take turns being ‘bystanders’ as the other one communicates with the interpreter respectively. The interpreter takes and is given responsibilities to make the question-answer sequences work, especially as far as respecting conditional relevances is concerned. This system seems to be fully functional for a professional management of such situations and thus {{could be used as}} an analytical tool in training future <b>liaison</b> <b>interpreters...</b>|$|R

5|$|The first {{recorded}} account of Japanese contact in Palau occurred in 1820, when a coastal sailing ship was blown off course and eight surviving men {{spent five years}} in Palau until 1825. Japanese traders began to establish settlements from the mid-19th century onwards, and by 1890 two Japanese trading stations had been established. Many of these traders married the daughters of local chieftains and raised local families. When Japan annexed Palau from Germany in 1914, Japanese settlers and their descendants acted as state <b>liaison</b> officials and <b>interpreters</b> for the Japanese military administration.|$|R
40|$|In Belgium at Lessius University College, the Master in Interpreting is {{the first}} to train {{students}} in liaison interpreting. Until than (i. e. 2007 - 2008) there hasn’t been an academic program for liaison interpreting. Students could (and can still) become conference interpreters in a postgraduate class of 1 year. In our presentation we want to discuss several problems that we have been dealing with in this new Master namely aptitude, training and research. Should we introduce aptitude tests at Master level already (while now tests are compulsory only in the postgraduate program) ? Researchers (Gerver, Gringiani, Russo, Pippa, Dodds, Moser-Mercer, Salaets-Timarova) has shown that aptitude is not “apt" yet to give satisfying results. The symposium on aptitude in Antwerp (may 2009) has shown that there {{is still a long way}} to go in aptitude: we’ll give some results of our research and try to give some possible solutions to do better in the future. As for training and research, the academic status of the Master in Interpreting clearly shows the need for a link between research, training and practice (Hale, 2007). A connection has to be made between basic and applied research and it needs to have outcomes in practice: the situation of practitioners (in their training and profession) must improve. How can we realize that? Students need to know both foreign languages and mother tongue very well and have to learn interpretation techniques to become good practitioners but they also have to reflect critically on their profession and their performances: interpreting studies, intercultural interaction, conversation analysis and - especially in business liaison - business discourse are some examples of academic disciplines that are of great interest for <b>liaison</b> <b>interpreters.</b> The trainer however often is not able to combine all of these disciplines, at least not at a highly scientific level, so how can we ask our students to do so? Most trainers are experienced practitioners and did not receive a research-based training, others are academics who are not on the market (anymore) because the combination of prac-teacher (i. e. teacher and professional interpreter) and researcher is a very rare one. We will explain how we try to manage anyway to gather knowledge by doing interdisciplinary research and to offer our students the badly needed practice to become a professional ready for the market. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|When World War II broke out, General Wladyslaw Sikorski - the Premier of the Polish {{government}} in exile - asked Szeryng, who was fluent in seven languages, {{to serve as}} his <b>liaison</b> officer and <b>interpreter.</b> Szeryng took these positions and discontinued his studies, although he continued to perform on the violin, giving over 300 concerts for Allied troops all over the world. When he accompanied Sikorski {{on a mission to}} Mexico in 1941 seeking a home for 4,000 Polish refugees, the positive reception moved Szeryng so deeply that he decided to become a Mexican naturalized citizen, and did so in 1946. In 1945 he accepted the request (made in 1943) that he head the string department of National University of Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Two {{submarines}} were sighted on 11 October 1942 about 800 mi off {{the coast}} of Washington as I-25 was returning to Japan. I-25 fired its last torpedo at the lead submarine, which sank in 20 seconds with the loss of all hands. I-25 reported sinking a U.S. submarine, but the submarine was actually Soviet L-16 which was sailing with L-15 en route from Vladivostok to the Panama Canal via Unalaska, Alaska and San Francisco. United States Navy Chief Photographer's Mate Sergi Andreevich Mihailoff of Arcadia, California, was aboard L-16 as a <b>liaison</b> officer and <b>interpreter,</b> and was killed with the remainder of the submarine crew. The United States Navy Western Sea Frontier denied loss of any submarine and withheld information about the Soviet loss because, at the time, the Soviet Union was officially neutral in the war between Japan and the United States.|$|R
5000|$|After school, Maze {{worked for}} his father's {{importing}} firm in Hamburg and Liverpool {{for ten years}} before moving to Canada for a year. [...] He then had a brief stint as a sailor. At the outbreak of World War I, Maze returned to France and attempted to join the French army but was deemed unfit. Determined to serve, Maze {{made his way to}} Le Havre and offered his services to the British and became an interpreter with the British cavalry regiment, the Royal Scots Greys. During the retreat from Mons, Maze became separated from the Royal Scots and narrowly avoided being captured by the Germans but was taken prisoner by a British unit. Maze's position with the Royal Scots Greys was unofficial and his lack of documentation and his odd uniform led the British to think he was a spy. Maze was summarily sentenced to death. On his way to face the firing squad, Maze was recognised by an officer from the Royal Scots Greys who happened to be passing and who quickly secured his release. Maze joined the staff of General Hubert Gough, initially as a <b>liaison</b> officer and <b>interpreter</b> but increasing as a military draughtsman undertaking reconnaissance work. Maze would go to advanced positions, often forward of the British trenches, to produce accurate drawings of enemy positions and other military objectives. The work was very dangerous and Maze was wounded three times in four years. He was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal and Military Medal by the British, and the Croix de Guerre and Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur by the French. His book, A Frenchman in Khaki (1934), detailed his experiences of the action that he saw on the Western Front. Churchill wrote the foreword to his book.|$|R
