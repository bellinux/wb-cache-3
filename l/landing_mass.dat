Tests were made with a 1 / 20 -scale model in order to determine behavior patterns and accelerations imparted to the ditching vehicle. Ditchings were made with different configurations of weight and gear position. Also the effects of different water surface conditions were investigated. The test results indicated that the favorable conditions for ditching usually involve a landing attitude of 12 deg. Smooth ditchings were always associated with the landing-gear retracted and never with the landing-gear extended.

Full scale AEDL Flight Tests {{can and should be}} done at Earth (need to get fast turn around between multiple tests). Do we need a Full Scale Validation Flight Test at Mars? Answer: Not, specifically, but the AEDL community is very uncomfortable with the notion of the very first full scale AEDL being piloted. The full scale unpiloted AEDL advance cargo mission that immediately precedes the human landing could do the trick. What kind of precursor AEDL Flight Tests are needed at Mars?

40|$|Supersonic retropropulsion (SRP) {{is the use}} of {{retrorockets}} {{to decelerate}} during atmospheric flight while the vehicle is still traveling in the supersonic/hypersonic flight regime. In the context of Mars exploration, subsonic retropropulsion has a robust flight heritage for terminal landing guidance and control, but all supersonic deceleration has, to date, been performed by non-propulsive (i. e. purely aerodynamic) methods, such as aeroshells and parachutes. ^ Extending the use of retropropulsion from the subsonic to the supersonic regime has been identified as an enabling technology for high mass humans-to-Mars architectures. However, supersonic retropropulsion still poses significant design and control challenges, stemming mainly from the complex interactions between the hypersonic engine plumes, the oncoming air flow, and the vehicle’s exterior surface. These interactions lead to flow fields that are difficult to model and produce counter intuitive behaviors that are not present in purely propulsive or purely aerodynamic flight. ^ This study will provide an overview of the work done in the design of SRP systems. Optimal throttle laws for certain trajectories will be derived that leverage aero/propulsive effects to decrease propellant requirements and increase total useful <b>landing</b> <b>mass.</b> A study of the mass savings will be made for a 10 mT reference vehicle based on a propulsive version of the Orion capsule, followed by the 100 mT ellipsoid vehicle assumed by NASA’s Mars Design Reference Architecture. ...|$|E

40|$|The Triton Hopper is {{a concept}} for a global hopper vehicle which uses a {{radioisotope}} rocket engine and In-situ propellant acquisition to explore the surface of Neptune's moon, Triton. The current Triton Hopper concept stores heated Nitrogen in a spherical tank {{to be used as}} the propellant. The aim of the research was to investigate the benefits of storing propellant at ambient temperature and heating it {{through the use of a}} thermal block during engine operation, as opposed to storing gas at a high temperature. Lithium, Lithium Fluoride and Beryllium were considered as possible materials for the thermal block. A heat energy analysis indicated that a lithium thermal mass would provide the highest heat energy for a temperature change from 900 Celsius to - 100 Celsius. A heat transfer analysis was performed for Nitrogen at - 100 Celsius flowing through 1000 passages inside a 1 kg lithium thermal block at a temperature of 900 Celsius. The system was analyzed as turbulent flow through a tube with constant surface temperature. The analysis indicated that the propellant reached a maximum temperature of 877 Celsius before entering the nozzle. At this exit temperature, the average specific impulse [I(sub sp) ] of the engine was determined to be 157 s. Previous studies for the stored heated gas concept suggest that the engine would have an average I(sub sp) of approximately 52 s. Thus, the use of a thermal block concept results in a 200 percent engine performance increase. In addition, a tank sizing study was performed to determine if the concept is feasible in terms of mass requirements. The mass for a spherical carbon fiber COPV storing 35 kg of nitrogen at an initial temperature of - 100 Celsius and a pressure of 1000 psia, was determined to be 7. 2 kg. The specific impulse analysis indicated that the maximum engine performance is obtained for a mass ratio of 5 kg of Nitrogen per every 1 kg of lithium thermal mass. Thus for 35 kg of Nitrogen the total thermal mass would be 7 kg. This brings the total mass of the system to 49. 2. kg which is less than the 56 kg landing payload capacity of the Triton Hopper. Finally, an insulation analysis using 10 mm of MLI insulation indicated that a total of 22 watts of heat are lost to the environment. With the heat loss known, the power required to heat the thermal mass to 900 Celsius in 24 days was determined to be 2. 15 watts. The study's results allowed us to conclude that the thermal mass concept is the better option due to the performance increase provided, the low power requirement and its compliance with the <b>landing</b> <b>mass</b> requirement of the Triton Hopper...|$|E
40|$|This final thesis {{project is}} {{done at the}} Control Laws EXPERTISE Team at the Auto Flight Control Systems Department of THALES Avionics in Toulouse. The {{division}} currently works for both aircraft and helicopter manufacturers. An autopilot (AP) for use in commercial aircrafts must be certified by national authorities; in the EU this body is named European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). For landing there are different certification standards. The first standard is called CAT I which is used when weather conditions prevents the pilot from seeing the runway during the initial approach. The CAT IIIa {{on the other hand}} is the standard needed when the weather conditions are so adverse that the pilot cannot see the runway markings until 50 ft over the ground. This project aims to investigate the possibility to upgrade a given aircraft from a CAT IIIa to a CAT IIIb EASA certification. The CAT IIIb includes the CAT IIIa with an AP controlled runway rollout. The work includes the following: System analysis Proposition of a control law Implementation in non linear Simulink model Mock-up: Simulation visualization with synchronized Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) and Primary Flight Display (PFD) The primary objective is not to search for the optimal solution for a CAT IIIb upgrade but rather to identify the eventual problems that will be encountered due to system architecture and rollout dynamics. First a system analysis is done. Here important information about the architecture is found. For example there is no connection between the nose wheel command and the auto flight system, which will be necessary, and some parts in the Fly-By-Wire (FBW) system have to be disconnected during the rollout. Also important is an analysis of the ground reaction model made by the client i. e. calculation of friction coefficients and forces. Next step is to develop a control law and a linear model for the rollout is therefore made. The absolute speed {{is supposed to be the}} rudder and the nose wheel, we obtain a 2 nd degree state space model with the yaw rate r [rd/s] and the lateral speed Vy [m/s] (AC - coordinates) states. Since the rudder only gives effect at relatively high speeds (over ≈ 100 knots) and the nose wheel due to stability only can be used at low speeds (under ≈ 50 kn) this can be seen as two different systems and one control law can be developed for each command. The commands are then distributed proportionally between these speeds. The maximal deviation from the runway for the nominal flight case with 15 knots of crosswind is acceptable. However, it does not converge until rather late in the rollout. Simulations with stronger crosswind and head wind have been made with good results. Wet runways or less <b>landing</b> <b>mass</b> seem to be the most degrading cases. At touch down a yaw bar appears in the FPD and shows the control target of the AP. The FMA is complemented with the mode rollout during that phase. The connection with the simulator makes it possible for the viewer to understand the relation between the different phases and the AP logics. The control law is stable for the nominal case and even for different masses and runway conditions. However, when these variables are changed simultaneously unstable behavior appears. The phase just after touchdown should be improved. The FMA and PFD with proper annunciation synchronized with the flight simulator enable the uninitiated to understand the CAT IIIb operation...|$|E
