Sixty-one arrived at the {{destination}} airfield. Ten pilots that encountered head winds, instead of the forecast tail wind (the only fuel reserve on the 1200-mile, six- to seven-hour over water flight) were forced to land in Portugal where they were interned. One more landed in Portugal after losing all electrical systems. One flight that broke up in a severe <b>line</b> <b>squall</b> over the Bay of Biscay lost one pilot (KIA)—he was flying alone, probably still on the deck, at max range cruise settings (165 to 175 MPH), when he was likely ambushed, and was shot down by a patrolling Junkers Ju 88 pilot of KG 40 of Fliegerführer Atlantik who claimed the kill; one pilot, after closing on the French coast to determine his location, ended up short of fuel and crash-landed in Spain, where he was interned; another pilot on that flight became lost and crash-landed in Ireland while attempting to return to England.|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} {{aviation}} industry in Nigeria {{and the increased}} adoption of air transportation {{as one of the}} best means of transport have been obstructed by various weather hazards. There is a greater need for aviation weather forecasters to deliver quality forecasts. It is therefore necessary to identify the most dangerous and most common weather hazards which are detrimental to the aviation industry so as to enhance the expertise on addressing them. This paper examined various weather hazards which include thunderstorm, fog, dust haze and <b>line</b> <b>squall</b> that affect flight operation such as flight delays, diversion and cancellation. The study revealed that fog accounted for 13. 2 % of flight cancellation at the airport and <b>line</b> <b>squall</b> similarly accounted for 10. 1 % of delays, 8. 4 % of diversion and 20 % of cancellation from 2000 - 2009 at the airport. The paper recommends that with the aid of improved forecasting tools such as Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) and Radar network which provides different images of clouds every fifteen minutes, it becomes much easier to identify dangerous clouds and give prior warning to the aviation industry...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a {{sequence}} of numerical weather prediction efforts utilizing the special observations from the GARP Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE). These observations, along with those available from the World Weather Watch, provide a unique opportunity to carry out numerical weather prediction (NWP) studies over portions of West Africa and the eastern Atlantic ocean utilizing high resolution limited area models. The present study reports on the results of 34 short-range numerical weather prediction experiments, with two simple models, designed to study the westward propagation of African waves. In the time frame of 24 to 48 hours, predictions at 700 mb (the level of maximum amplitude of these waves, and the level of non-divergence) show extremely promising results. These results are comparable to fine-mesh predictions in higher latitudes. Errors in phase speed and vector root mean square (RMS) wind errors are summarized for the third phase of GATE. A second part of this study deals with the problem of specification of the West African squall line with respect to the position of the predicted trough line of the African wave. A body of recent literature provides useful obser-vational statistics relating the position of African waves, certain geographical regions, the time of day and the formation of <b>line</b> <b>squall</b> systems. These studies also provide information on the relative speeds of westward motion of the squall line and the wave trough. The decay of the squall lines during their westward propagation away from the trough is also 8 part of these observational statistics. Based on these observations, an empirical set of selection rules may be defined to specify the squall lines with respect to the predicted motion field. Successful results were obtained in the time frame of 24 to 48 hours for these experiments, the results of which are summarized below. 1...|$|E

50|$|During the {{southwest}} monsoon, southwesterly winds {{pass over the}} mountains of Sumatra and creates mountain waves on the leeward {{side of the mountain}} thus creating an unstable atmosphere. As the atmosphere becomes highly unstable, the thunderstorms begin to merge into each other forming a <b>squall</b> <b>line.</b> This <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> is then steered by {{the southwest}}erly winds causing the storm to move northeastwards and moving into the Straits of Malacca. When this <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> moves offshore to the Straits of Malacca, it is usually night and thus, warmer air rising over the Straits of Malacca would cause the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> to intensify. As the abundance of moisture over the Straits of Malacca condenses, it releases huge amounts of latent heat of condensation and this helps the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> maintain its strength and intensify even more. This <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> then moves towards the coast of Peninsular Malaysia or Singapore. As this <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> moves inland, it is deprived of latent heat of condensation and hence, dissipates rapidly.|$|R
25|$|A <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> is an {{organized}} line of thunderstorms. It {{is classified as}} a multi-cell cluster, meaning a thunderstorm complex comprising many individual updrafts. They are also called multi-cell <b>lines.</b> <b>Squalls</b> are sometimes associated with hurricanes or other cyclones, {{but they can also}} occur independently. Most commonly, independent squalls occur along front lines, and may contain heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, dangerous straight line winds, and possibly funnel clouds, tornadoes and waterspouts. <b>Squall</b> <b>lines</b> require significant low-level warmth and humidity, a nearby frontal zone, and vertical wind shear from an angle behind the frontal boundary. The strong winds at the surface are usually a reflection of dry air intruding into the line of storms, which when saturated, falls quickly to ground level due to its much higher density before it spreads out downwind. Significant <b>squall</b> <b>lines</b> with multiple bow echoes are known as derechos.|$|R

Despite having a precipitation pattern similar to the conceptual model of an asymmetric <b>squall</b> <b>line,</b> the development and evolution of the storm system was considerably different from previous asymmetric <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> studies. Dual-Doppler data collected on 24 - 25 May 1997 during the TEXACAL field campaign revealed that the asymmetric <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> developed from the merging of two distinct <b>squall</b> <b>lines</b> oriented parallel to each other. The development of the trailing stratiform precipitation region and the evolution of the convection within the southern part of the convective line were influenced by the merging <b>squall</b> <b>lines.</b> The trailing stratiform region formed as dissipating convection in the northern portion of the western <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> merged with the developing stratiform precipitation region associated with the eastern <b>squall</b> <b>line.</b> Intense storm-relative rear inflow was present at the rear of the northern portion of the western <b>squall</b> <b>line.</b> A pronounced anticyclonic circulation associated with a bow echo along the leading edge of the southern portion of the western <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> affected the intensity of convection in the southern part of the domain as the flow entered the rear of the convective line and accelerated towards the leading edge causing intense upward motion and strong convection...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of surface {{conditions in the}} form of changing surface temperatures on fully developed mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) is investigated using a cloud system resolving setup of the ICON model (1 km grid spacing). The simulated MCSs take the form of <b>squall</b> <b>lines</b> with trailing stratiform precipitation. After the <b>squall</b> <b>lines</b> have reached a quasi steady-state, secondary convection is triggered ahead of the <b>squall</b> <b>line,</b> resulting in an increase of <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> propagation speed, also known as discrete propagation. The higher propagation speed is then maintained {{for the remainder of the}} simulations because secondary convection ahead of the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> acts to reduce the environmental wind shear over the depth of the <b>squall</b> <b>line’s</b> cold pool. The surface conditions have only a marginal effect on the <b>squall</b> <b>lines</b> themselves. This is so because the surface fluxes cannot significantly affect the cold pool, which is continuously replenished by mid-tropospheric air. The mid troposphere remains similar given the use of identical initial profiles. The only effect of the surface fluxes consists in an earlier acceleration of the <b>squall</b> <b>line</b> due to earlier initiation of secondary convection with higher surface temperature. Finally, a conceptual model to estimate the change in surface temperature needed to achieve a change in onset time of pre-frontal secondary convection and the associated discrete propagation events given environmental conditions is presented...|$|R

The first, an isentropic model of airflow over and around the Alps, is used to investigate flow patterns favourable for the initiation of deep con-vection in the region.
