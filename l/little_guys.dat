500|$|After {{the court}} issued its decision, some {{commentators}} praised the Court's ruling for [...] "further individual liberty by striking down a government’s unjustified censorship of protected speech". David A. Cortman, counsel for Good News Community Church, said the Court's ruling was an [...] "important victory {{for all the}} <b>little</b> <b>guys</b> who have ever found their speech silenced by the strong arm of government". Likewise, Nina Totenberg reported that one consequence of the Court's decision is that [...] "the government has much less power to regulate how other people speak." [...] However, other commentators criticized the majority opinion's methodology; Hadley Arkes, for example, wrote that the Court's decision [...] "revealed the unlovely spectacle of the conservatives talking themselves ever deeper into a genuine moral relativism in the regulation of speech". Some analysts also claimed the majority's opinion left open unanswered questions within the Court's First Amendment jurisprudence. Lyle Denniston, for example, suggested that after the Court issued its decisions in Reed and Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, [...] "the meaning of the First Amendment, in general, became somewhat more confusing". Eugene Volokh also suggested the Court's opinion {{is likely to be}} litigated again in lower courts.|$|E

2500|$|Edwards {{was hired}} as {{athletic}} director and head football coach at Wittenberg, his alma mater, in 1955. He put in a pro-style offense and focused on passing because his players were smaller than many opponents. [...] "We had small players, but <b>little</b> <b>guys</b> can throw the football and <b>little</b> <b>guys</b> can catch it, whereas you need big guys to block for a running game," [...] he said in 1973. Under Edwards, the Wittenberg Tigers were a major success, amassing a 98–20–4 record in 14 seasons and winning the NCAA College Division national championship poll in 1962 and 1964. Edwards's teams were unbeaten three times and lost one game in five of his seasons there. He was named Ohio College Football Coach of the Year in 1957 by his fellow coaches. The American Football Coaches Association named him {{coach of the year}} in 1963 and 1964, when the Tigers won all of their games. He was called [...] "a combination of Genghis Khan and Santa Claus" [...] by Sports Illustrated for being both tough and sympathetic to his players.|$|E

[...] Sanchez further noted that seeing the swarmites die was [...] "strangely satisfying and totally hilarious." [...] IGN's Colin Moriarty called the swarmite deaths [...] "saddening and necessary," [...] but added that players will [...] "never grow tired of seeing it happen." [...] Ben Reeves of Game Informer also enjoyed the game's humor, but felt that there was not enough variety to keep a player's interest. [...] "It may be fun to watch these <b>little</b> <b>guys</b> die, but there were too many moments where I wanted to kill the power to my console." ...|$|E

[...] O'Neal signed a two-year contract with the Celtics for the 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 season for the league minimum of $1.3 million and adding to the Celtics–Lakers rivalry. Bill Simmons of ESPN speculated that O'Neal wanted to tie Bryant with five titles and that still [...] "Shaq hates Kobe and Kobe hates Shaq." [...] O'Neal said he didn't [...] "compete with <b>little</b> <b>guys</b> who run around dominating the ball, throwing up 30 shots a night – like D-Wade, Kobe." [...] O'Neal added that he is only competing against Tim Duncan: [...] "If Tim Duncan gets five rings, then that gives some writer the chance to say 'Duncan is the best,' and I can't have that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the legal}} suits, {{development}} proceeded and in April 2008, Guillermo del Toro {{was hired to}} direct the film. DelToro has {{said he was a}} fan of Jackson's trilogy and had discussed directing a film adaptation of Halo with him in 2005. Though that project stalled, they kept in contact. In a 2006 interview, delToro was quoted saying [...] "I don't like <b>little</b> <b>guys</b> and dragons, hairy feet, hobbits, [...] I don't like sword and sorcery, I hate all that stuff". After he signed on to direct in April 2008, DelToro posted on TheOneRing.net forums that he had been enchanted by The Hobbit as a child, but found that Tolkien's other books [...] "contain geography and genealogy too complex for my prepubescent brain". [...] In taking the job of director, delToro was now [...] "reading like a madman to catch up with a whole new land, a continent of sorts—a cosmology created by brilliant philologist turned Shaman". [...] He also posted that his appreciation of Tolkien was enhanced by his knowledge of the fantasy genre and the folklore research he had undertaken while making his own fantasy films.|$|E
2500|$|O'Neal said he didn't [...] "compete with <b>little</b> <b>guys</b> who {{run around}} {{dominating}} the ball, throwing up 30 shots a night—like D–Wade, Kobe." [...] O'Neal {{added that he}} was only competing against Duncan: [...] "If Tim Duncan gets five rings, then that gives some writer the chance to say 'Duncan is the best,' and I can't have that." [...] Publicly, he insisted he did not care whether he started or substituted for the Celtics, but expected {{to be part of the}} second unit. Privately, he wanted to start, but kept it to himself. O'Neal missed games throughout the season due to an assortment of ailments to his right leg including knee, calf, hip, and Achilles injuries. The Celtics traded away center Kendrick Perkins in February partially due to the expectation that O'Neal would return to fill Perkins' role. The Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury, and they were 19–3 in games that O'Neal played over 20minutes. After requesting a cortisone shot, O'Neal returned April 3 after missing 27games due to his Achilles; he played only five minutes due to a strained right calf. It was the last regular season game he would play that year. [...] O'Neal missed the first round of the 2011 playoffs. He insisted on more cortisone shots and returned in the second round, but he was limited to 12minutes in two games as the Heat eliminated the Celtics from the playoffs.|$|E
