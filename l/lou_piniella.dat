5|$|Four Yankees GMs are {{enshrined}} in the National Baseball Hall of Fame: Ed Barrow, George Weiss, Larry MacPhail, and his son, Lee MacPhail. Ralph Houk, Gene Michael, <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella,</b> and Bob Watson were former Yankees players. Houk, Michael and Piniella served as field managers for the Yankees before becoming GM.|$|E
5|$|Several {{managers}} {{have won the}} award in a season when they led their team to 100 or more wins. <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> won 116 games with the Seattle Mariners in 2001, the most by a winning manager, and Joe Torre won 114 with the New York Yankees in 1998. Sparky Anderson and Tony La Russa finished with identical 104–58 records in 1984 and 1988, respectively. Three National League managers, including Dusty Baker, Whitey Herzog, and Larry Dierker, have exceeded the century mark as well. Baker's San Francisco Giants won 103 games in 1993; Dierker's 1998 Houston Astros won 102 and Herzog led the Cardinals to 101 wins in the award's third season.|$|E
5|$|On April 16, 1981, the New York Yankees made {{a stop in}} Nashville to play an {{exhibition}} game against the Sounds. The 10–1 Yankees victory was played {{in front of a}} standing-room only crowd of 17,318spectators. Some Yankees present at the game included owner George Steinbrenner, coach Yogi Berra, and players Reggie Jackson, Bucky Dent, <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella,</b> Bobby Murcer, Goose Gossage, Tommy John, and Johnny Oates. The Yankees returned for another game against the Sounds on April 28, 1983. Former Sound Don Mattingly, as well as Yankees manager Billy Martin and pitcher Goose Gossage were in attendance. The Sounds, who trailed the Yankees, 4–0, going {{into the bottom of the}} ninth inning, scored five runs to beat the Yankees, 5–4, before a crowd of 13,641.|$|E
50|$|October 14 - The Yankees {{even the}} Series with the Dodgers 2-2 when <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella's</b> 10th-inning single scores Roy White with {{the winning run}} in a 4-3 Yankees victory.|$|R
50|$|He was a {{first cousin}} of Dan Carnevale, a minor league manager who made the majors in 1970 with the Kansas City Royals as a first base coach (in <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella's</b> rookie year there).|$|R

5|$|The Manager of the Year Award is {{an honor}} given {{annually}} since 1983 to the best managers in the American and National Leagues. The winner is voted on by 28 members of the BBWAA. Each places a vote for first, second, and third place among the managers of each league. The manager with {{the highest score in}} each league wins the award. In 1991, Bobby Cox became the first manager to win the award in both leagues, winning with the Atlanta Braves and having previously won with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1985. Tony La Russa, <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella,</b> and Jim Leyland have since won the award in both leagues. Joe Girardi is the only manager to win the award with a fourth-place team (2006 Florida Marlins); he is also the only manager to win the award after fielding a team with a losing record.|$|E
5|$|On April 16, 1981, the New York Yankees made {{a stop in}} Nashville to play an {{exhibition}} game against the Sounds. The 10–1Yankees victory was played {{in front of a}} standing room only crowd of 17,318fans. Also on hand for the game were Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, coach Yogi Berra, and players Reggie Jackson, Bucky Dent, <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella,</b> Bobby Murcer, Goose Gossage, Tommy John, and Johnny Oates. The Sounds won {{the second half of the}} season and went on to win the Western Division championship after defeating the Memphis Chicks in three straight games. The team suffered in the best-of-five league championship series, falling to the Orlando Twins, 3–1. Nashville compiled an 81–62 record during the season under Stump Merrill. Jamie Werly won the Southern League Most Outstanding Pitcher Award after leading the circuit with 18complete games and 193strikeouts. Don Mattingly and Willie McGee, who both played for the Sounds in 1981, were later promoted to the major leagues. In 1985, Mattingly was named the American League Most Valuable Player and McGee named the National League MVP.|$|E
5|$|The Tampa Bay Rays, {{originally}} {{named the}} Devil Rays, joined Major League Baseball at its last expansion in 1998. The team's inaugural manager was Larry Rothschild, {{who spent his}} entire managerial career with the Rays. He managed the team for parts of four seasons and accrued a 205–294 record. Rothschild was replaced during the 2001 season by Hal McRae. Before the 2003 season, McRae was replaced by <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella,</b> who led the team for three seasons. After 2005, Piniella departed {{and was replaced by}} Joe Maddon, who has statistically been the most successful manager in franchise history. Maddon is the only manager to lead the Rays to the postseason, accumulating an 8–8 record and leading his team to the 2008 World Series. He leads all Rays managers in games managed (648), regular season wins (308) and losses (340), and winning percentage (.475). Maddon also won the 2008 and 2011 American League Manager of the Year Award. Maddon opted out of his contract in late October 2014. On December 5, 2014, the Rays hired former Cleveland Indians bullpen coach Kevin Cash to replace Maddon.|$|E

50|$|Pagán {{returned}} in May 2007, being recalled {{in place of}} Matt Murton, who had struggled somewhat and was not getting regular at-bats. Pagán then became a regular outfielder and enjoyed modest success until his season was cut short due to a bout with colitis. On June 2, 2007, Pagán was called out at third base trying to move up after a wild pitch, which led to <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella's</b> most infamous meltdown.|$|R
50|$|Dave Righetti faced Mike Caldwell in Game 2. The Brewers {{needed to}} win this game to stay in {{contention}} and it certainly looked good with Caldwell having allowed only run in the fourth on <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella's</b> homer. But the decision to allow Caldwell pitch the ninth proved costly as he surrendered a two-run homer to Reggie Jackson. Dave Winfield collected three hits while Righetti pitched a dominant four-hit shutout for six innings and Goose Gossage got his second consecutive save.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} season, Barrett {{made headlines}} {{again when he}} {{got into a fight}} with teammate Carlos Zambrano. During a game against the Atlanta Braves on June 1, 2007, tensions began to rise between the two players when the Cubs allowed the Braves to score five runs in the fifth inning. The Braves recorded 20 hits, en route to winning 8-5. However, their productivity became overshadowed by the scuffle between Zambrano and Barrett. As the two returned to the dugout, they had an exchange of words, which escalated into a small fight. After <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> dismissed the two from the game, another fight ensued within the Cubs’ clubhouse, and Zambrano punched Barrett's lip. The wound required Barrett {{to go to the hospital}} immediately and receive stitches. Zambrano remorsefully admitted he was at fault after the ordeal, and Barrett later stated they had resolved their differences. Both players received fines for undisclosed amounts of money.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} 37seasons since Durocher, the Cubs have had 22 managers. Jim Frey and Don Zimmer {{led the team}} to the National League Championship Series (NLCS) in 1984 and 1989, respectively. In both of those seasons, the team's manager won a Manager of the Year Award. Jim Riggleman managed the team for five years from 1995 through 1999, earning the team's first and only wild card playoff spot in 1998. Dusty Baker's Cubs lost in the 2003 NLCS {{during the first year}} of a {{four-year}} managing tenure. Baker's successor, <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella,</b> led the team to two consecutive National League Central Division titles during his first two years with the team and was awarded the 2008 Manager of the Year Award. On July 20, 2010, Piniella announced his intention to retire as manager of the Cubs following the end of the season. However, on August 22, 2010, Piniella announced he would resign after that day's game with the Atlanta Braves, citing family reasons. Third base coach Mike Quade would finish the rest of the season as manager. The Cubs' current general manager is Jed Hoyer, who replaced Jim Hendry.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 19 {{managers}} {{in the history of}} the Seattle Mariners Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. The Mariners franchise was formed in 1977 as a member of the American League. Darrell Johnson was hired as the first Mariners manager, serving for just over three seasons before being replaced during the 1980 season. In terms of tenure, <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> has managed more games and seasons than any other coach in their franchise history. He managed the Mariners to four playoff berths (1995, 1997, 2000 and 2001), led the team to the American League Championship Series in 1995, 2000 and 2001, and won the Manager of the Year award in 1995 and 2001. Piniella is the only manager in Mariners history to lead a team into the playoffs, with one of those times after a 116-win season, tying the record for most wins in a season. None of the previous managers had made it to the playoffs before. Piniella, however, managed the team in 34 playoff games, winning 15, and losing 19. Dick Williams is the only Mariners manager to have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E

He stayed with the Reds through Piniella's departure in , after which he left for his fourth stint in Texas (1993-1994, during the managerial tenure of Kevin Kennedy), followed by three seasons as bench coach for the Colorado Rockies {{on the staff of}} Don Baylor.|$|R

5|$|There {{have been}} fifty-nine {{different}} {{managers in the}} team's franchise history: four while it {{was known as the}} Cincinnati Red Stockings (1882–1889), four while it was known as the Cincinnati Redlegs (1953–1958) and the other fifty-one under the Cincinnati Reds (18821952, 1959–present). In baseball, the head coach of a team is called the manager, or more formally, the field manager. Pop Snyder was the first manager of the Reds and managed from 1882 to 1884. Sparky Anderson is the franchise's all-time leader in regular-season games managed (1,450) and regular-season game wins (863). He is followed by Bill McKechnie in both categories with 1,386 and 744, respectively. Anderson is the only Reds manager to have won the World Series twice, in 1975 and 1976. Pat Moran, <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella,</b> and McKechnie have one World Series victory each; Moran was the manager during the Black Sox Scandal, which refers to the events {{that took place in the}} 1919 World Series. McKechnie led the team to the championship in 1940, while Piniella led the team to it in 1990. Jack McKeon is the only manager to have won the Manager of the Year Award with the Reds, which he won in 1999. The most recent manager of the Reds is Bryan Price, and the current owner is Robert Castellini.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, the American League {{decided to}} adopt the {{designated}} hitter rule. On April 6, opening the season at Fenway Park, Ron Blomberg of the Yankees became the first designated hitter in Major League history. Red Sox pitcher Luis Tiant walked Blomberg in his first plate appearance of the game. Later that year at Fenway Park, with the score tied 2–2 {{in the top of}} the ninth, Yankees catcher Thurman Munson attempted to score from third base on a missed bunt by Gene Michael. He crashed into Red Sox catcher Carlton Fisk resulting in a fight with Munson punching Fisk in the face. The rivalry intensified in the 1970s with the fans too, as just a year later in 1974 at Fenway Park, Yankees first baseman Chris Chambliss was struck in the right arm with a dart thrown from the stands after hitting an RBI ground-rule double. Two years later, Yankee outfielder <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> would crash into Fisk feet first in an attempt to score in the sixth inning of a game at Yankee Stadium. The two benches cleared while Piniella and Fisk brawled at home plate. After the fight apparently died down and order appeared to be restored, Sox pitcher Bill Lee and Yankee third baseman Graig Nettles and center fielder Mickey Rivers began to exchange words, resulting in another fight. Lee suffered a separated left shoulder from the tilt and missed the next 51 games of the 1976 season. He would continue to pitch until 1982. The 1976 season saw the Yankees win the pennant, but lose to the Big Red Machine in the 1976 World Series, just like the Red Sox had done a year prior in the 1975 World Series in which Carlton Fisk hit his famous home run off of the left field foul pole at Fenway Park.|$|E

25|$|New York Mets manager Willie Randolph and San Diego Padres manager Bud Black were {{selected}} as coaches by manager Clint Hurdle. Randolph was later replaced by Chicago Cubs manager <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> after Randolph {{was fired by}} the Mets on June 16.|$|E
25|$|After the Cubs fired Dusty Baker in 2006, {{the rivalry}} {{was raised by}} another notch as they {{replaced}} him with <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella.</b> Coincidentally, Piniella and La Russa both grew up in Tampa and faced {{each other in the}} 1990 World Series as managers of the Cincinnati Reds and Oakland Athletics, respectively.|$|E
25|$|On August 6, {{the entire}} Yankee team {{attended}} Munson's funeral in Canton. Teammates <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> and Bobby Murcer, who were Munson's best friends, gave eulogies at {{the gathering of}} seven hundred at the civic center. That night before a national viewing audience on ABC's Monday Night Baseball, the Yankees beat the Orioles 5-4 in New York, with Murcer driving in all five runs with a three-run {{home run in the}} seventh inning and a two-run single {{in the bottom of the}} ninth.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, the Angels {{suffered}} the worst collapse in franchise history. In {{first place in}} the AL West by 11 games in August, the team again lost key personnel (particularly shortstop Gary DiSarcina) and went on an extended slide during the final stretch run. By season's end, they were in a first-place tie with the surging Seattle Mariners, prompting a one-game playoff for the division title. The Mariners, managed by <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> and led by pitching ace Randy Johnson, laid a 91 drubbing on the Angels in the playoff game, clinching the AL West championship and forcing the Angels and their fans to endure yet another season of heartbreak and bitter disappointment.|$|E
25|$|In , {{the start}} of ABC's Monday Night Baseball {{coverage}} was moved back to June, due to poor ratings during the May sweeps period. In place of April and May prime time games, ABC began airing Sunday Afternoon Baseball games in September. The network also aired one Friday night game (Yankees at Angels) on June 13 of that year. On August 6, 1979 the entire Yankee team attended team captain/catcher Thurman Munson's funeral in Canton, Ohio. Teammates <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> and Bobby Murcer, who were Munson's best friends, gave eulogies. That night (before a national viewing audience on ABC's Monday Night Baseball) the Yankees beat the Baltimore Orioles 5–4 in New York, with Murcer driving in all five runs with a three-run {{home run in the}} seventh inning and a two-run single {{in the bottom of the}} ninth.|$|E
500|$|Later that month, Cub manager <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> told Bradley {{to leave}} the dugout and go home after he [...] "went after" [...] a Gatorade cooler in {{frustration}} after flying out in another interleague game, against the Chicago White Sox. Piniella and Bradley later confronted {{each other in the}} locker room and exchanged words. Piniella later apologized to Bradley, and reinserted him back into the line-up during the team's next start.|$|E
500|$|The Mariners' late season comeback, {{their first}} {{division}} title in franchise history, {{and ultimately the}} Double, brought the Seattle fan base back to life and sparked a desire to keep the team in town. <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella,</b> the Mariners' manager from 19932002, called Martinez's hit and the 1995 postseason [...] "the hit, the run, the game, the series and the season that saved baseball in Seattle." [...] Soon after the events of October 8, the Washington State Legislature held a special session and approved an alternative funding package to enable {{the building of a}} new ballpark, which culminated in the construction of Safeco Field.|$|E
500|$|In , Lemon {{guided the}} Royals {{to their first}} winning season since the {{franchise}} began as an expansion team in [...] Lemon {{finished second in the}} Associated Press AL Manager of the Year voting. Before the 1972 season, Lemon talked about the team's chances, saying [...] "Five clubs could win it, including ourselves." [...] However, the Royals finished 76–78 in Lemon's last year with the club. Royals owner Ewing Kauffman fired Lemon as manager and stated that he wanted a younger person to fill the position and [...] "did not want to lose Jack McKeon", who was named as Lemon's replacement. Royals outfielder <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> was one of several players who disagreed with Kauffman's decision, saying, [...] "...Lemon deserved to manage the club next year." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 8, Zito {{became the}} first pitcher in the AL to win 20 games when he pitched seven innings and allowed no earned runs against the Minnesota Twins. [...] "I'm not {{pitching}} for the Cy Young", Zito said. [...] "I'm pitching to get the Oakland A's into the playoffs and to the World Series." [...] In his next start, against the Seattle Mariners, Zito took a no-hitter into the eighth inning before John Olerud singled to leadoff the inning. Seattle manager <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> said if he could vote for the Cy Young Award winner, [...] "It would go to that young man who pitched for the Oakland team. There are other deserving pitchers, but [...] has won 21 games and he competes well." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{managers}} have had multiple tenures with the Yankees. Billy Martin served five terms as Yankee manager. Before {{his death in}} 1989, Martin was rumored to be {{in line for a}} sixth term if the Yankees started the 1990 season poorly. Yogi Berra, Houk, Bob Lemon, Gene Michael, <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> and Dick Howser each served two terms as the Yankees' manager. Howser's first term lasted only a single game, as interim manager in 1978 between Martin's firing and Lemon's hiring. Howser also managed a full season in 1980, leading the team to the playoffs, but was fired after the Yankees failed to advance to the World Series. Howser has the highest career winning percentage among all Yankee managers at [...]632.|$|E
500|$|In 1987 {{he had a}} below-average {{season by}} his standards, fueling {{criticism}} from the New York media, which had never covered Henderson or his eccentricities kindly. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner issued a press release claiming that manager <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> wanted to trade Henderson for [...] "jaking it" [...] (playing lackadaisically). Still, Henderson had his best on-base percentage to that point in his career (.423), with a [...]291 batting avg., was fifth in the AL in stolen bases (41) and hit 17 home runs despite playing only 95 games. It was the only season from 1980 to 1991 in which Henderson did not lead the AL in steals. Seattle's Harold Reynolds led the league with 60 steals; Reynolds {{tells the story of}} getting an impish phone call from Henderson after the season: ...|$|E
500|$|Barrett {{was unable}} {{to live up to}} {{expectations}} in the 2007 season. He {{was unable to}} replicate his statistical figures from the previous season, and finished May with a [...]244 batting average and only seven home runs. Barrett infamously made headlines when he was involved in a nationally televised dugout altercation with pitcher Carlos Zambrano. <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> dismissed both players for the afternoon, while the League proceeded to fine both players. Nearly two weeks later, a television camera caught Barrett engaging in a heated argument with Rich Hill over a pitch that resulted in an RBI. The tensions caused Barrett to lose his role as the Cubs' everyday starting catcher. While Barrett increased his batting average over the next few games, his career with the Cubs began to come to a close near the middle of June.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{to their}} {{division}} counterparts, the Cincinnati Reds were established as the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1882, and have employed 59 managers under 3 different names since that time. The team's first manager was Pop Snyder, {{who led the}} team to an American Association championship in their inaugural season. His [...]648 winning percentage is highest among Reds managers who have led the team {{for more than one}} complete season. Seven managers have led the franchise to the postseason, while four have won World Series: Pat Moran in 1919; Bill McKechnie in 1940; Sparky Anderson in 1975 and 1976; and <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> in 1990. Anderson is the franchise's all-time leader in regular-season games managed (1,450) and regular-season game wins (863). Jack McKeon is the only manager to win the Manager of the Year Award with the team, and the current manager is Bryan Price who was hired in October 2013 for the 2014 season. Dusty Baker was the previous manager whom was ultimately fired after the loss in the 2013 playoffs to the Pittsburgh Pirates.|$|E
500|$|Torrez {{was removed}} from the game after walking Mickey Rivers. [...] Reliever Bob Stanley came in, and after Rivers stole second Thurman Munson drove him in with a double. In the eighth inning, a home run by Reggie Jackson made the score 5–2 in favor of the Yankees. [...] The Red Sox cut New York's lead to just one run {{in the bottom of the}} eighth against closer Goose Gossage on RBI singles by Fred Lynn and Yastrzemski. [...] But the Yankees would hold off the Red Sox, thanks in part to a heads-up {{defensive}} play by right fielder <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> with one out in the bottom of the ninth. [...] With Burleson on first base, Jerry Remy hit a line drive to Piniella in right field, but Piniella was blinded by the late afternoon sun and could not see the ball. However, he pretended to field the play normally, pounding his glove as though he would easily catch the ball. [...] This prevented Burleson from advancing to third base. [...] When Jim Rice followed with a deep fly to the outfield, Burleson could only move up to third base instead of scoring the tying run.|$|E
500|$|The Chicago Cubs {{franchise}} {{began as}} the Chicago White Stockings in 1876, with Albert Spalding as the franchise's inaugural manager. The team's second manager, Cap Anson, set team records in games managed (2,194), seasons managed (18), and wins (1,242). Frank Chance, {{part of the}} famous Tinker to Evers to Chance double-play combination—all of whom managed the franchise at some point—has the best winning percentage in club history (.664), led the Cubs franchise to World Series victories in 1907 and 1908. During the early 1960s, owner Philip K. Wrigley utilized a [...] "College of Coaches", using a rotating system of multiple managers rather than a single field leader. <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> managed the Cubs from 2007–2010 and led the team to consecutive postseason appearances in 2007 and 2008, becoming the first manager to lead the team to multiple postseasons since Charlie Grimm's four appearances from 1932–1935. Dale Sveum was hired for the 2012 season and let go {{at the end of}} the 2013 season. After firing Sveum, Rick Renteria was hired as manager. Renteria was replaced as the manager of the Cubs by Joe Maddon formerly of the Tampa Bay Rays. Maddon was introduced to the press on Nov. 3, 2014.|$|E
500|$|In the 1990 National League Championship Series, the Reds {{faced the}} Pittsburgh Pirates in a best-of-seven game series. In Game 1, the Reds, the home team, {{opened up a}} 3–0 lead but trailed 4–3 as the game entered {{the bottom of the}} ninth inning. Todd Benzinger led off the inning with a pinch-hit single against Bob Patterson. Patterson walked the next batter, Eric Davis, but forced an out at third base when Ron Oester tried to {{sacrifice}} Davis over. Manager <b>Lou</b> <b>Piniella</b> put Bates into the game as a pinch runner for Oester. Davis, at second, tried to steal third, and Bates followed; while Davis was safe, Pirates catcher Mike LaValliere threw to second and Bates was out by three feet, which made the second out in the inning. Speaking about himself, Bates said he thought he [...] "had a better jump than [...] did", and added that he should not have attempted the steal. The Reds failed to score that inning and lost the game. Bates' next postseason appearance came in Game 3, when he pinch ran for Joe Oliver and scored a run as the Reds won 6–3. Cincinnati ultimately defeated the Pirates and moved on to the World Series, where they would play the Oakland Athletics for the league championship.|$|E
