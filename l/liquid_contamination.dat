40|$|When {{drilling}} ice cores {{deeper than}} ∼ 100 m, drill liquid {{is required to}} maintain ice-core quality and to limit borehole closure. Due to high-pressure air bubbles in the ice, the ice core can crack during drilling and core retrieval, typically at 600 – 1200 m depth in Greenland. Ice from this 'brittle zone' can be contaminated by drill liquid as it seeps through cracks into the core. Continuous flow analysis (CFA) systems are routinely used to analyse ice for chemical impurities, so the detection of drill liquid is important for validating accurate measurements and avoiding potential instrument damage. An optical detector was constructed to identify drill liquid in CFA tubing by ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy at a wavelength of 290 nm.

One of the disadvantages of this technique is that dentists or dental technicians that wish to label using this technique require the computer hardware and software discussed in our study. Another limitation of this technique is that it must be performed carefully to prevent <b>liquid</b> <b>contamination.</b> However, the use of microchips allows the stored data to be modified or new information to be added. This method, which has been used to label implant-supported fixed dentures, can also be used to label removable dentures. Microchips can be placed in a protective capsule and inserted in an area that is not visible. Advantages of this labelling technique include a data storage capacity of 16, 000  kb, which is sufficient to store all information regarding a patient’s dental and medical histories, as well as information regarding the physician. The microchips used in our studies do not undergo deformation in the range from −[*] 40 [*]°C to 120 [*]°C, as recommended by the manufacturer. In addition, the microchips will not resist fire when used for labelling of a removable prosthesis, although the restoration, cement, and abutment may have an insulating effect by increasing heat resistance. There will likely be negative effects on the structural integrity of the prosthesis since the microchips are located within the dental implant abutment. However, the advantage of this technique is that it will not affect plaque retention since it is isolated from the oral environment. However, further studies are required to assess bioaccumulation, patients’ expectations, and aesthetic views, which can be demonstrated within the limitations of our study (Clement et al. 2006; Stavrianos et al. 2007).|$|E

40|$|Soil is a complex, {{potentially}} heterogeneous, lossy, and dispersive medium. Modeling {{the propagation}} and scattering of electromagnetic (EM) waves in soil is, hence, more challenging than in air {{or in other}} less complex media. This chapter will explain fundamentals of the numerical modeling of EM wave propagation and scattering in soil through solving Maxwell’s equations using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The chapter will explain how: (i) the lossy and dispersive soil medium (in both dry and fully water-saturated conditions), (ii) a fourth phase (anomaly), (iii) {{two different types of}} transmitting antennae (a monopole and a dipole), and (iv) required absorbing boundary conditions can numerically be modeled.

Consequently, this has implications for the development of toxic signs and for treatment onset. In the present study, clinical signs, toxicokinetics and effects on respiration, electroencephalogram and heart rate were investigated in hairless guinea pigs after percutaneous exposure to 500 μg/kg VX. We found that full inhibition of AChE and partial inhibition of BuChE in blood were accompanied by the onset of clinical signs, reflected by a decline in respiratory minute volume, bronchoconstriction and a decrease in heart rate. Furthermore, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of a single dose of atropine, obidoxime and diazepam, administered at appearance of first clinical signs, versus that of repetitive dosing of these drugs on the reappearance of signs. A single shot treatment extended the period to detrimental physiological decline and death for several hours, whereas repetitive administration remained effective as long as treatment was continued.

40|$|It {{has been}} some 20 years since I {{published}} my first paper on organic <b>liquid</b> <b>contamination</b> of the subsurface. That article {{was among the first}} to model the infiltration of organic solvents into aquifer systems. Before the mid- 1980 s, the importance of separate phase liquid pollutants was not appreciated, and most investigations into groundwater contamination had focused on solute (dissolved constituent) transport. Since that time, substantial resources have been dedicated to research on the behavior of what have become known as nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs). Within 5 – 10 years of those first articles, practitioners started to identify particular classes of NAPLs on the basis of their environmental persistence and ease of subsurface detection. The two most common classes are a) NAPLs composed of fuel hydrocarbons that are lighter (LNAPLs) than water and, thus, more easily detected, because they tend to remain within the unsaturated zone or capillary fringe areas of an aquifer; and b) organic solvent or dense NAPLs (DNAPLs) that tend to migrate deep into formations, becoming entrapped in irregular finger-like structures or pooled on low permeability strata. Laboratory evidence, coupled with a series of careful field case studies, soon revealed that fuel hydrocarbon plumes emanating from LNAPL contamination sites tended to stabilize with time, due to a series of microbial transformation processes (commonly termed “natural attenuation”). As a consequence of these investigations, monitored natural attenuation has become an accepted environmental management strategy for plumes at man...|$|E

40|$|Oil {{condition}} and contamination {{can be a}} major issue in lubrication systems such as aircraft, automobiles etc. Lubricating or cooling oil contamination occurs when metallic or non-metallic particles are produced due to wear of machine components and these are not captured by the filter system. Furthermore, thermal stressing causes oxidation and thereby degradation of the oil. <b>Liquid</b> <b>contamination</b> can occur from water condensation or fuel from heat exchangers. These can cause degradation of the oil and reduce the lubricating properties and clogg oil paths and accelerate the wear of moving parts. On-line oil condition monitoring systems are important for preventive maintenance especially for aircraft engine bearings, aviation gearboxes etc. Current on-line oil condition monitoring sensors are mainly eddy current, optical based. These sensors have a major drawback that they are prone to surface contamination and non-linearity. The gauges are also not sensitive enough to detect extremely small particulates or are prone to false detection such as trapped bubbles. A new sensor has been developed using thin film heat transfer sensors that can detect any form of contamination in oil such as metal, nonmetals, oxidation, liquids etc. The sensor works on the principle of measuring the thermal product of the material, as the composition of the material in contact with the sensor changes the thermal product changes and can be detected. The sensor can be used for both on-line and in-line condition monitoring and has been demonstrated to be robust. Initially, lab based tests were carried out to optimise the system for sensitivity and signal to noise ratio. The sensor has been demonstrated to detect 0. 25 % of contaminants by mass. Experiments were carried out by seeding metallic and non-metallic particles of various sizes to an engine oil system to validate its performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} {{bioactive}} compounds from natural sources has been on-going for centuries. The synthesis and/or isolation of these valuable compounds make them reasonably expensive; in addition their production is often wasteful given the quantities of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) often used. In recent years research in ionic liquids (ILs) and biomass dissolution has increased due to the ' beauty' of this relatively novel solvent to effectively break down the hard matrix of difficult biopolymers. This positive step in biomass dissolution offers the possibility of completely separating lignocellulosic biomass into its major polymeric components: cellulose, lignin and hemicelluloses. We can therefore apply this knowledge to the extraction of bioactive compounds,from biomass. Herein two types of biomass were considered; land biomass (cinnamon bark) and aquatic biomass (macroalgae). This project involved two major phases. Firstly, evaluating the effect of IL pre-treatment {{of these types of}} biomass against conventional methods such as autoclave extraction, Soxhlet extraction, hot and cold maceration, hydrodistillation and supercritical carbon dioxide extraction. These methods were compared in terms' of the percentage yields of. the extract recovered and their overall feasibility. As this project specifically targeted higher value materials particularly. from macroalgae another major part of this project was the development of an experimental protocol for the evaluation of the biological activity of extracts recovered from the brown algae. The tests chosen were the antioxidant and anti-diabetic properties and again were evaluated after the protocols were developed. These tests were chosen for their growing importance to society., It has been shown that the extracts recovered from the ionic liquid & solution were higher than that from the conventional methods employed. Nevertheless the extracts from the conventional methods had higher biological activity than those from the ionic liquid.

40|$|Flexible {{packaging}} is {{a growing}} successful market {{and the majority of}} flexible package applications are for the food industry. The demand for process optimization and reduced production costs, has led to an increase in flexible packaging. However, fast production lines can result in contamination in the seal area. For flexible food packaging, contamination is considered any food particle or substance trapped in the seal area. Current quality control processes can detect contamination in the seal area, but it is not determined if seal contamination affects seal quality. Oil-based and sodium based snack foods are two common categories that can be packaged on a horizontal form fill and seal (HFFS) flow-wrap machine. The study uses vegetable oil and a salt water solution to simulate the effect of <b>liquid</b> <b>contamination</b> along the T-point of flexible pouches made on an HFFS. The T-point refers to where the fin seal meets the end seal and requires the seal jaw to seal through four layers of film, which is the most difficult point to seal. The study tests a combination of different sealing temperatures and dwell time to determine the optimal sealing condition for a hermetic seal. A quality hermetic seal provides an enclosed seal with no leaks due to successful polymer chain entanglement between the two sealant layers. The different test categories of the study are non-contaminated (control), salt water solution for salt based foods, and vegetable oil for oil-based foods. Given the test parameters of the study, 140 ⁰C sealing temperature and 0. 3 seconds dwell time are considered to be the optimal sealing condition for all three test categories. For Phase 1 of the study, salt water had a lower Hermeticity pass rate compared to vegetable oil and non-contaminated seals. In addition, the effect of refrigerated storage temperature and ambient storage temperature did not show to be significant for any of the test categories. However, refrigerated conditions showed a higher Hermeticity pass rate, but it was not statistically different. The findings for seal strength indicated no test category had higher or lower seal strength over the 14 day test period. Overall, the study shows there is no effect of liquid contaminant on Hermeticity and seal strength for flexible film with LLDPE sealant layer...|$|E

Contaminated groundwater threatens many valuable water resources which may have adverse human health consequences. Groundwater contamination often goes unnoticed as it occurs underground and it is often impossible to, and often very expensive to rehabilitate. Groundwater pollution originating from industrial sites is a general problem in many industrialized countries, but also in developing countries such as South Africa. Among the various types of groundwater contamination, DNAPL (Dense Non-Aqueous Phase <b>Liquids)</b> <b>contamination</b> is a common one.

This dissertation will present {{the preparation}} of ultrafine structures and functional surfaces over large areas utilizing a combination of top-down lithography technique and bottom-up wrinkling method. First, a simple, scalable and cost-effective spacer lithography approach utilizing polydopamine coating technique was developed for the fabrication of well-controlled nanopatterns with feature size in the sub- 20 nm scale. Briefly, a thin layer of polydopamine (PDA) was conformally deposited on the sidewalls of pre-patterned poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) features to form a spacer layer. After etching the PDA film on the horizontal surfaces and removing the PMMA resist, only the PDA spacer was left on the substrate, forming a new pattern. The pattern density of the new features was doubled and the feature size was well tuned to a sub- 20 nm scale. We also utilized a bottom-up wrinkling technique to spontaneously pattern and functionalize polymer films. Through a reactive silane-infusion induced surface instability, wrinkled patterns with tunable wavelengths were easily produced over large areas and the surface chemical functionality of the wrinkles was well-tuned by the infusion of different functional silanes. Hierarchically wrinkled patterns with micro/nano structure were achieved by combining wrinkling with nanoimprint lithography. The hierarchically wrinkled surfaces exhibited superhydrophobicity with water contact angles higher than 160 °and water sliding angle lower than 5 °. To scale up these patterned functional surfaces over large areas, roll-to-roll nanoimprint lithography technique was investigated for the continuous fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces and lubricant infused patterned surfaces based on hierarchically wrinkled surfaces. These functionally patterned surfaces displayed self-cleaning properties to a variety of <b>liquid</b> <b>contaminations</b> and anti-biofouling properties when challenged with Escherichia coli bacteria.

Surfactant treatmentwas conducted at low flow rates with Tween® 80. Sparging {{was conducted by}} air injection but at a lowflow rate of 1 mL min 1. Finally several columns were thermally treated at a temperature of 80 C. Theresults showed high removal (> 90 %) for all techniques used, although only thermal treatment on BTEX(Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene and Xylenes) reached 100 % efficiency. The main limiting factors of eachtechnique were: (i) for oxidation, the solubility of the substance limited the removal; (ii) for surfactantboth the solubility in the surfactant {{and the type of}} surfactant are important; (iii) for sparging, the mainfactors are contaminant vapor pressure and porous media grain size; (iv) for thermal treatment, thelimitation arises from the contaminant vapor pressure and the medium hydraulic conductivity. Acomparison with literature data shows that the results are consistent with most of the studies conductedon one technique...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the past}} decades, {{subsurface}} non-aqueous phase <b>liquid</b> (NAPL) <b>contamination</b> {{has been recognized}} as one of the most widespread and challenging environmental problems. Thus, researchers have focused their efforts on developing and testing the efficiency of remediation methodologies, able to address the unique nature of these contaminants. Recently, in-situ flooding techniques for the accelerated removal of NAPLs trapped in the subsurface have been proposed, where additives are injected together with water upgradient of the NAPL-contaminated area in order to alter the physio-chemical properties of the contaminants, such as interfacial tension, and enhance their solubilities. In this work, the efficiency of ethanol enhanced NAPL remediation is addressed. To this end, a non-linear, multi-objective optimization strategy is developed by combining a multiphase flow simulation model with evolutionary algorithms. Two conflicting optimization objectives are considered: minimizing operation cost and maximizing remediation efficiency, while preventing uncontrolled NAPL mobilization. More specifically, the first objective involves the operation cost of the procedure, which is directly proportional to the pumping rate, duration and ethanol volume used. The second represents the environmental considerations of the problem that, in this work, are described by the maximization of free product removal and the prevention of DNAPL vertical spreading...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2004 Dense Non-Aqueous Phase <b>Liquid</b> (DNAPL) <b>contamination</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{environmental}} concerns today. DNAPL can remain in significant quantities as residual contaminants in the low permeability zones even after the bulk phase has been removed. As the drive fluid sweeps through the aquifer it follows the path of least resistance, which is the high permeability zone. Thus the contaminants trapped in the low permeability zones remain as residuals and serve as a source for prolonged contamination. Conventional remediation techniques are ill-equipped to deal with the heterogeneities of the aquifers. Various techniques to enhance the efficiency of the conventional methods are tried without significant success. Reducing the temperature of soil formations can modify aquifer flow paths. The natural freezing of soils in winter may be used effectively to modify the flow paths. In summer, permeability modification can be accomplished by emplacement of microbial polymer gels. In this thesis, we have investigated using a laboratory scale one dimensional column experiment, a novel technique to reduce the volume of residual DNAPL using a combination of natural freezing in winter and biopolymer in summer...|$|R
