50|$|Spacecraft {{trajectory}} - During early Apollo program {{missions to}} the Moon, the spacecraft {{was put on}} a free return trajectory — if the engines had failed at <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion,</b> the craft would have safely coasted back to Earth.|$|R

50|$|The {{major event}} of day 4 was <b>Lunar</b> <b>Orbit</b> <b>Insertion</b> (LOI).

50|$|Thrusters aboard each {{spacecraft}} {{were capable}} of producing 22 N. Each spacecraft was fueled with 103.5 kg of hydrazine {{to be used by}} the thrusters and main engine to enable the spacecraft to enter <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> and transition to the science phase of its mission. The propulsion subsystem consisted of a main fuel tank and a Re-repressurization system which were activated shortly after <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Gemini {{spacecraft}} {{would have}} rendezvoused with stacked Centaur and Agena upper stages in low Earth orbit. The Centaur would have placed the Gemini and Agena onto a circumlunar trajectory, along {{which they would}} coast {{until they reached the}} Moon.

40|$|The Lunar Prospector {{mission is}} the first {{dedicated}} NASA lunar mapping mission since the Apollo Orbiter program which was flown over 25 years ago. Competitively selected under the NASA Discovery Program, Lunar Prospector was launched on January 7, 1998 on the new Lockheed Martin Athena 2 launch vehicle. The mission design of Lunar Prospector {{is characterized by a}} direct minimum energy transfer trajectory to the moon with three scheduled orbit correction maneuvers to remove launch and cislunar injection errors prior to lunar insertion. At lunar encounter, a series of three <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> maneuvers and a small circularization burn were executed to achieve a 100 km altitude polar mapping orbit. This paper will present the design of the Lunar Prospector transfer, <b>lunar</b> <b>insertion</b> and mapping <b>orbits,</b> including maneuver and orbit determination strategies in the context of mission goals and constraints. Contingency plans for handling transfer <b>orbit</b> injection and <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> anomalies are also summarized. Actual flight operations results are discussed and compared to pre-launch support analysis...|$|R
50|$|As {{of spring}} 2010, ARTEMIS P1 (THEMIS B) has {{performed}} two Lunar flybys and one Earth flyby, and was approaching insertion into a Lissajous <b>orbit</b> around a <b>Lunar</b> Lagrange point. <b>Lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> was targeted for April 2011. ARTEMIS P2 (THEMIS C) completed a Lunar flyby {{and was on}} the inbound leg of the first of three deep space excursions on its way to a Lissajous orbit and was targeted for <b>Lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> in April 2011.|$|R
25|$|During {{the three-day}} trans-lunar coast, the four-man crew would monitor the Orion's systems, inspect their Altair {{spacecraft}} and its support equipment, and correct their flight path {{as necessary to}} allow the Altair to land at a near-polar landing site suitable for a future lunar base. Approaching the lunar far side, the Orion/Altair combination would orient the Altair's engines forward and make the <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> (LOI) burn.|$|R
40|$|Planetary {{protection}} {{has been}} an important consideration during the process of designing the Mars Observer mission. It affected trajectory design of both the interplanetary transfer and the orbits at Mars; these in turn affected the observation strategies developed for the mission. The Project relied mainly on the strategy of collision avoidance to prevent contamination of Mars. Conservative estimates of spacecraft reliability and Martian atmosphere density were used to evaluate decisions concerning the interplanetary trajectory, the <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>phase</b> at Mars, and operations in orbit at Mars and afterwards. Changes in the trajectory design, especially in the <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>phase,</b> required a refinement of those estimates...|$|R
40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is {{currently}} developing mission architectures, vehicle concepts and flight hardware {{to support the}} planned human return to the Moon. During Phase II of the 2006 Lunar Lander Preparatory Study, a team from the Langley Research Center was tasked with developing and refining two proposed Lander concepts. The Descent-Assisted, Split Habitat Lander concept uses a disposable braking stage to perform the <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> maneuver {{and most of the}} descent from <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> to the surface. The second concept, the Cargo Star Horizontal Lander, carries ascent loads along its longitudinal axis, and is then rotated in flight so that its main engines (mounted perpendicular to the vehicle longitudinal axis) are correctly oriented for <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> and a horizontal landing. Both Landers have separate crew transport volumes and habitats for surface operations, and allow placement of large cargo elements very close to the lunar surface. As part of this study, lightweight, efficient structural configurations for these spacecraft were proposed and evaluated. Vehicle structural configurations were first developed, and preliminary structural sizing was then performed using finite element-based methods. Results of selected structural design and trade studies performed during this activity are presented and discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{last major}} event before <b>Lunar</b> <b>Orbit</b> <b>Insertion</b> (LOI) {{was a second}} mid-course correction. It was in {{retrograde}} (against direction of travel) and slowed the spacecraft down by 2.0 ft/s, effectively lowering the closest distance that the spacecraft would pass the moon. At exactly 61 hours after launch, about 24200 mi from the Moon, the crew burned the RCS for 11 seconds. They would now pass 71.7 mi from the lunar surface.|$|R

5000|$|They {{began their}} return to Earth on Christmas Day with a rocket burn made on the Moon's far side, out of radio contact with Earth. (For this reason, the <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> and trans-Earth {{injection}} burns were the two most tense moments of this first lunar mission.)

40|$|A simple {{strategy}} is identified to generate ballistic transfers between the Earth and Moon, i. e., transfers that perform two maneuvers: a trans-lunar injection maneuver to depart the Earth and a <b>Lunar</b> <b>Orbit</b> <b>Insertion</b> maneuver to insert into orbit at the Moon. This {{strategy is}} used to survey the performance of numerous transfers between varying Earth parking orbits and varying low <b>lunar</b> target <b>orbits.</b> The transfers surveyed include short 3 - 6 day direct transfers, longer 3 - 4 month low energy transfers, and variants that include Earth phasing <b>orbits</b> and/or <b>lunar</b> flybys...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the guidance targeting techniques for the Apollo command module and launch vehicle is discussed for four types of maneuvers: (1) translunar injection, (2) translunar midcourse, (3) <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion,</b> and (4) return to earth. The {{development of}} real-time targeting programs for these maneuvers and the targeting procedures represented are discussed. The material is intended to convey historically the {{development of the}} targeting techniques required to meet the defined target objectives and to illustrate the solutions to problems encountered during that development...|$|R
40|$|The Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission {{successfully}} completed mapping the Moon's gravity field {{to an unprecedented}} level for {{a better understanding of}} the internal structure and thermal evolution of the Moon. The mission success was critically dependent on the success of the <b>Lunar</b> <b>Orbit</b> <b>Insertion</b> (LOI). In this paper we establish a set of LOI criteria to meet all the requirements and we use these criteria to establish Go/No-Go boundaries of the last, statistical Trajectory Correction Maneuvers (TCM- 5 s) for operations...|$|R
50|$|The first {{spacecraft}} {{to fly a}} circumlunar trajectory was Luna 3. Circumlunar trajectories were also used by Apollo missions prior to <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion,</b> to provide a free return to Earth {{in the event of}} a propulsion system malfunction on the way to the Moon. This was used on Apollo 13, when an oxygen tank rupture necessitated return to Earth without firing the Service Module engine, although a number of course corrections using the Lunar Module descent engine were required to maintain this trajectory.|$|R
5000|$|The LADEE {{spacecraft}} {{made three}} [...] "phasing orbits" [...] of Earth before it accomplished a <b>Lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> (LOI), which occurred at perigee {{of the third}} orbit using a three-minute engine burn. The target orbit for the third Earth orbit had a perigee of 200 km, an apogee of 278000 km and an inclination of 37.65 degrees. The planned argument of perigee is 155 degrees, while its characteristic energy, C3 is -2.75 km2/s2.The novel trajectory using orbital phasing loops was done for four main reasons: ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>orbit</b> {{support for}} <b>Lunar</b> Prospector (LP) {{consists}} of three main areas: (1) cislunar orbit determination, (2) rapid maneuver assessment using Doppler residuals, and (3) routine mapping orbit determination. The cislunar phase consisted of two trajectory correction maneuvers during the translunar cruise followed by three <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> burns. This paper will detail the cislunar orbit determination accuracy and the real-time assessment of the cislunar trajectory correction and <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> maneuvers. The non-spherical gravity model of the Moon is the primary influence on the mapping orbit determination accuracy. During {{the first two months}} of the mission, the GLGM- 2 lunar potential model was used. After one month in the mapping orbit, a new potential model was developed that incorporated LP Doppler data. This paper will compare and contrast the mapping orbit determination accuracy using these two models. LP orbit support also includes a new enhancement - a web page to disseminate all definitive and predictive trajectory and mission planning information. The web site provides definitive mapping orbit ephemerides including moon latitude and longitude, and four week predictive products including: ephemeris, moon latitude/longitude, earth shadow, moon shadow, and ground station view periods. This paper will discuss the specifics of this web site...|$|R
40|$|As of late-July 2011, the ARTEMIS {{mission is}} {{transferring}} two spacecraft from Lissajous orbits around Earth-Moon Lagrange Point # 1 into highly-eccentric <b>lunar</b> science <b>orbits.</b> This paper presents the trajectory {{design for the}} transfer from Lissajous <b>orbit</b> to <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion,</b> the period reduction maneuvers, and the science orbits through 2013. The design accommodates large perturbations from Earth's gravity and restrictive spacecraft capabilities to enable opportunities {{for a range of}} heliophysics and planetary science measurements. The process used to design the highly-eccentric ARTEMIS science orbits is outlined. The approach may inform the design of future planetary moon missions...|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> for Apollo missions {{was planned}} as a nominal 60 nmi km circular orbit above the Moon's surface. Initial <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> was an ellipse with a perilune of 60.0 nmi km and an apolune of 168.5 nmi km, at an inclination of 12° from the lunar equator. This was then circularized at 60.7 nmi km by 59.7 nmi km, with an orbital period of 128.7 minutes. The effect of lunar mass concentrations ("masscons") on the orbit {{was found to}} be greater than initially predicted; {{over the course of the}} twenty-hour mission, the orbit was perturbated to 63.6 nmi km by 58.6 nmi km.|$|R
40|$|Launch and arrival {{parameters}} for the Radio Astronomy Explorer-B mission were revised to provide better tracking station {{coverage of the}} transfer trajectory. It is shown that changing the launch azimuth and flight time is sufficient to provide postinjection tracking by Tananarive and Carnarvon, and redundant <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> coverage by command stations. These changes {{can be made with}} no significant influence on the other parameters and without sacrificing many launch opportunities. All acceptable launch opportunties during the RAE-B launch period are tabulated together with pertinent launch and arrival parameters...|$|R

5|$|One {{of these}} {{proposals}} was the Gemini <b>Lunar</b> <b>Orbit</b> Rescue Vehicle, {{which was designed}} to retrieve the crew of an Apollo spacecraft stranded in orbit around the Moon. It was to have used a stretched reentry module to accommodate the three astronauts who would have been aboard the Apollo. This would have been attached to a modified Equipment Module. The Equipment Module contained engines which would be used for <b>Lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> and trans-Earth injection, as well as life support equipment to keep the crew alive until they returned to Earth. Launch and trans-Lunar injection would have been performed by a Saturn V. Once the spacecraft was in <b>Lunar</b> <b>orbit,</b> the Apollo crew would have boarded it by means of an EVA.|$|R
40|$|The Lunar Observer mission {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the moon in its global context. Motivation for this project comes from scientific interest {{and the need for}} robotic precursor missions in the proposed Space Exploration Initiative. The multiple roles to be performed by this mission mean that the trajectory design process promises to be quite complex and unique. The choice of launch vehicle, launch opportunity and daily launch window are affected by the selection of the translunar transfer trajectory, as well as the arrival conditions desired at <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion.</b> The length of the mission and the tight <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> control requirements determine the design of the circumlunar portions of the Lunar Observer mission...|$|R
50|$|The N1-L3 {{version was}} {{developed}} {{to compete with the}} United States Apollo-Saturn V to land a man on the Moon, using the same <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> rendezvous method. The basic N1 launch vehicle had three stages, which was to carry the L3 lunar payload into low Earth orbit with two cosmonauts. The L3 contained an Earth departure stage; another stage used for mid-course corrections, <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion,</b> and powered descent initiation; a single-pilot LK Lander spacecraft; and a two-pilot Soyuz 7K-LOK lunar orbital spacecraft for return to Earth. The Apollo spacecraft was able to carry three astronauts (landing two on the Moon), and relied on the Saturn V's third stage for Earth departure.|$|R

5000|$|After liftoff, Chang'e 1 {{made three}} orbits around the Earth, a burn at perigee {{extending}} the orbit's apogee further each time, until a final translunar injection burn {{placed it on}} course for the Moon on October 31, 2007. Another burn placed it in a polar orbit around the Moon, with burns at the periselenium {{of the first three}} orbits decreasing the aposelenium until it entered a final circular <b>orbit.</b> <b>Lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> was achieved on the November 5, 2007.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the analysis performed on the <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> and some of the possible contingencies for the European Student Moon Orbiter (ESMO). Originally scheduled for launch in 2014 – 2015 as a piggyback payload, it was the only ESA planned mission to the Moon. By way of a weak stability boundary transfer, ESMO is inserted into an orbit around the Moon. Propellant use is at a premium, so the operational orbit is selected to be highly eccentric. In addition, an optimization is presented to achieve an orbit that is stable for 6 months without requiring orbit maintenance. A parameter study is undertaken to study the sensitivity of the <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion.</b> A database of transfer solutions across 2014 and 2015 is used to study the relation between the robustness of weak capture and the planetary geometry at lunar arrival. A number of example recovery scenarios, where the <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> manoeuver partially or completely fails, are also considered...|$|R
50|$|The N1 was a {{very large}} rocket, {{standing}} 105 m tall with its L3 payload. The N1-L3 consisted of five stages in total: the first three (N1) for insertion into a low Earth parking orbit, and another two (L3) for translunar injection and <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion.</b> Fully loaded and fueled, the N1-L3 weighed 2750 t. The lower three stages were shaped to produce a single frustum 17 m wide at the base, while the L3 section was mostly cylindrical, carried inside a shroud 3.5 m (estimated) wide. The conical shaping of the lower stages {{was due to the}} arrangement of the tanks within, a smaller spherical kerosene tank on top of the larger liquid oxygen tank below.|$|R
