40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 4 th Annual Symposium on Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects (GRASP) held at the Hughes Metropolitan Complex, Wichita State University, April 25, 2008. Research completed at the Department of Aerospace Engineering, College of EngineeringFatigue cracks and corrosion damage are critical issues for aircraft, especially for the aging fleet still in use today. The most frequent area of damage is on the aircraft skin, more specifically the joint regions. A structural health monitoring system is being sought after as a system of sensors to detect and localize damage during flight, {{reducing the amount of}} time spent in ground inspections and amount of ground inspections overall. Currently, studies from companies and universities are being done, using a variety of different sensing methods, including acoustic emission (AE) testing, ultrasonic testing (UT), and by optical fiber with fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) as strain gages. AE and FBG sensors are passive systems by ‘listening’ to cracks growth or measuring stiffness change around the crack, respectively. These two methods can be combined to form an active network, checking the other methods in real-time by using guided waves of UT. This study looks at analyzing the abilities of AE and FBG sensors to work as both passive and active systems, comparing results to one another. Due to temperature problems in skewing responses of guided waves, a network of sensors is formed as well to use a correlation in baseline approach, negating this effect, and is tested for fatigue damage on a <b>metal</b> <b>lap</b> joint configuration over cyclic loading. FBG sensors are found to be more directional based and can work in replacing strain gages, while AE sensors can be used well in conjunction with active UT...|$|R
40|$|Der Schwerpunkt dieser Arbeit liegt auf der präzisen Beschreibung von geschweißten einschnittigen Überlappverbindungen aus Metall / Faser-Kunststoff-Verbunden unter mechanischer Belastung. Durch Synergieeffekte von optischen und thermischen Messverfahren kann das Deformations- und Dehnungsverhalten verschiedenste Probeformen charakterisiert werden. Zunächst wird ein kurzer Überblick über die genutzten optischen und thermischen Messverfahren gegeben. Vor- und Nachteile der Verfahren werden hierbei detailliert erläutert. Nachfolgend geraten Ultraschallgeschweißte einschnittige Überlappverbindungen in den Fokus der Betrachtungen. Dabei kommen statische, dynamische und schlagartige Beanspruchungen zum Einsatz. Das Deformations- und Dehnungsverhalten wird jeweils mit einem geeigneten Messverfahren beschrieben. Vor- und Nachteile der einzelnen Messverfahren werden, für eine spätere Nutzung von Synergieeffekten, durch Messungen an demselben Probekörper deutlich herausgearbeitet. Im letzten Kapitel der Arbeit wird eine Finite Element Simulation der einschnittigen Überlappverbindungen erstellt. Es wird gezeigt, dass unter zu Hilfenahme der ortsaufgelösten Deformations- und Dehnungsmessungen die Genauigkeit der FE - Simulation deutlich verbessert werden kann. Die wichtigsten Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit sind zusammenfassend dargestellt: -Kopplung von Grauwertkorrelation und Scanning Acoustic Microscopy zur Dehnungsdarstellung in optisch nicht zugänglichen Bereichen -Verbesserung der FE-Simulation durch genaueste Dehnungsmessungen -Kopplung verschiedener optischer Systeme zur Dehnungsmessung über mehrere Größenordnungen -Vergleich von Grauwertkorrelation und Elektronischer Speckle Pattern Interferenz -Erklärung des thermoelastischen Spannungssignals mittels FE-SimulationThe {{main focus}} of this thesis {{is to get a}} precise {{description}} of welded single <b>lap</b> joints of <b>metal</b> and fibre reinforced plastic while mechanically deformed. This is done by using the synergy-effects of three different optical and thermal measurement systems for the characterisation of different specimen. Initially the thesis gives a brief overview of the provided thermal and optical measurement systems, including their specific errors and their limits of use. The measurements are done with plane joints of metal and reinforced plastic. Their deformation behaviour is described qualitative and quantitative. Afterwards the geometric more complex ultrasonic welded joints of AlMg 3 and CF-PA 66 become focus of the research. Depending on the load type, the appropriate measurement system is selected. Static, dynamic and crash loads are used to describe the complex specimen reaction. It is displayed, that the use of one measurement system is often enough for a basic understanding of the strain and stress distributions when different loads are applied. To acquire exact knowledge of the comparability of the different measurement methods the strain distribution of a single specimen was measured by all systems. Thus, the advantages and limits of the different measurement systems can be described in detail. Applying this basic knowledge all measurement systems can be used synergistically. The last chapter deals with a finite element analysis of the problem (single lap joint in tension test), which allows the comparison of all measurement methods. It is demonstrated, that the use of the measured strains can help to improve the accuracy of the finite element simulation. The main task of this dissertation is to describe the exact strain and stress distribution of the specimen in tensile test. Using all the results of the measurements and their combination, the complex welded single lap joint is described in detail. To obtain the best results, the following steps are realized: -Coupling of the digital image correlation with the scanning acoustic microscopy. There for a measurement of the strains in the not visible interface layer between metal and fibre reinforced plastic can be done. -Using the most accurate results of the strain measurements to improve the finite element simulation. -Combining the electronic speckle pattern interferometry with the digital image correlation to measure the strains {{in a wide range of}} load situations. -The subsequent comparison of digital image correlation and electronic speckle pattern interferometry. -The finite element simulation, improved by the results of the measurements, is used to explain the measured signal of the following thermoelastic stress analysis. Concluding it is necessary, to use the advantages of different measurement systems to achieve a precise understanding and exact description of the strain distributions. The combination of thermal, optical and ultrasonic measurement systems gives more precise information of the stressed areas, than only one of the measurement system with the highest accuracy...|$|R
