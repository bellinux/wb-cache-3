25|$|EMS {{systems such}} as HSST/Linimo can provide both {{levitation}} and propulsion using an onboard <b>linear</b> <b>motor.</b> But EDS systems and some EMS {{systems such as}} Transrapid levitate but do not propel. Such systems need some other technology for propulsion. A <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> (propulsion coils) mounted in the track is one solution. Over long distances coil costs could be prohibitive.|$|E
25|$|The new Innovia Metro still offers <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> {{propulsion}} as the advantageous {{option but}} an electric rotary propulsion version {{is also an}} option. The first rotary-powered Innovia Metro 300 system is being implemented in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.|$|E
25|$|Aérotrain S44 was a {{full-size}} passenger-carrying car intended for suburban commuter service at speeds of 200km/h (in particular links between city centres and airports).

50|$|Many designs {{have been}} put forward for <b>linear</b> <b>motors,</b> falling into two major categories, low-acceleration and high-acceleration <b>linear</b> <b>motors.</b> Low-acceleration <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> are {{suitable}} for maglev trains and other ground-based transportation applications. High-acceleration <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> are normally rather short, and are designed to accelerate an object to a very high speed, for example see the coilgun.|$|R
50|$|<b>Linear</b> <b>motors</b> {{are widely}} used. One {{of the major}} uses of <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> is for {{propelling}} the shuttle in looms.|$|R
50|$|Outside {{of public}} transportation, {{vertical}} <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> {{have been proposed}} as lifting mechanisms in deep mines, {{and the use of}} <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> is growing in motion control applications. They are also often used on sliding doors, such as those of low floor trams such as the Citadis and the Eurotram. Dual axis <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> also exist. These specialized devices have been used to provide direct X-Y motion for precision laser cutting of cloth and sheet metal, automated drafting, and cable forming. Most <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> in use are LIM (<b>linear</b> induction <b>motor),</b> or LSM (<b>linear</b> synchronous <b>motor).</b> <b>Linear</b> DC <b>motors</b> are not used due to higher cost and linear SRM suffers from poor thrust. So for long run in traction LIM is mostly preferred and for short run LSM is mostly preferred.|$|R
25|$|The Rohr prototype, officially {{called the}} Urban Tracked Air Cushion Vehicle (UTACV) and colloquially the Rohr Aerotrain, was {{propelled}} by <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> and {{was designed to}} carry 60 passengers at 150mph (240km/h). It had a length of 94ft (28m) and an empty weight of 46,000 pounds (20.8 metric tons).|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the British {{electrical}} engineer Eric Laithwaite, {{a professor at}} Imperial College London, developed the first full-size working model of the linear induction motor. He became professor of heavy electrical engineering at Imperial College in 1964, where he continued his successful development of the <b>linear</b> <b>motor.</b> Since linear motors do not require physical contact between the vehicle and guideway, they became a common fixture on advanced transportation systems in the 1960s and 70s. Laithwaite joined one such project, the Tracked Hovercraft, although the project was cancelled in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Another recent {{roller coaster}} {{development}} by Intamin is the ZacSpin, {{a type of}} 4th Dimension roller coaster that was first seen in 2007. The Green Lantern at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California, is the first ZacSpin in the United States and opened July 1, 2011. It has individual cars, each with 8 seats, arranged in two pods coming off {{the sides of the}} car, each with 2 seats facing forward and two facing backward. This car is either lifted to the highest point by a conventional chain lift, or propelled around the course at a constant speed by a <b>Linear</b> <b>Motor</b> system.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> in use are LIM (<b>linear</b> {{induction}} <b>motors)</b> or LSM (<b>linear</b> synchronous <b>motors).</b> <b>Linear</b> DC <b>motors</b> are {{not used}} as it includes more cost and linear SRM suffers from poor thrust. So for long run in traction LIM is mostly preferred and for short run LSM is mostly preferred.|$|R
50|$|However, {{because of}} end effects, <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> cannot 'run light' -- normal {{induction}} motors {{are able to}} run the motor with a near synchronous field under low load conditions. In contrast, end effects create much more significant losses with <b>linear</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{the need}} for speed and {{precision}} in modern manufacturing technologies increases, <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> are attracting considerable research attention. Heat management and thermal deformation associated with <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> comprise a major concern tied to the demand for machining accuracy. Here we describe a three-dimensional finite-element simulation analysis method that utilizes a three-phase <b>linear</b> synchronous <b>motor</b> for thermally characterizing a feed-driven system. We also present results from simulations and experiments aimed at verifying system thermal time constants and temperature distributions. These results demonstrate that the proposed analytical method is capable of making accurate and useful predictions of temperature and thermal behavior distributions for <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> in terms of conventional heat generation in various transient and steady-state phases. It is our hope that these results will support future efforts to design modern feed-driven systems equipped with <b>linear</b> <b>motors...</b>|$|R
25|$|The linear {{motors and}} {{steerable}} axles used in Innovia Metro trains are relatively rare, although similar Japanese designed <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> propulsion technologies {{are also used}} {{on a number of}} subway lines in East Asia, such as the Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line, Toei Ōedo Line and Guangzhou Metro Line 5. However, the Innovia Metro system has a number of competitors in the field of automated light metros, including the VAL technology developed by Matra for the Lille Metro in France (and now owned by Siemens) and the Meteor technology used by Paris Métro Line 14 (which is built to high-capacity, full metro standards). Furthermore, the CITYFLO and SelTrac signaling technologies are not specific to the Innovia Metro, but can also equip most conventional railway lines regardless of propulsion technology or carrying capacity.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> was {{naturally}} {{suited to}} use with maglev systems as well. In the early 1970s, Laithwaite discovered a new arrangement of magnets, the magnetic river, that allowed a single <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> to produce both lift and forward thrust, allowing a maglev system to be built with a single set of magnets. Working at the British Rail Research Division in Derby, along with teams at several civil engineering firms, the [...] "transverse-flux" [...] system was developed into a working system.|$|E

Innovia Metro is compatible with Bombardier's own CITYFLO 650 integrated transit automation system and is offered in variants compatible with both <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> and electric rotary propulsion. [...] Bombardier now markets the Innovia Metro alongside the larger Movia Metro and has touted its system versatility.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the public}} imagination, [...] "maglev" [...] often evokes {{the concept of}} an {{elevated}} monorail track with a <b>linear</b> <b>motor.</b> Maglev systems may be monorail or dual rail and not all monorail trains are maglevs. Some railway transport systems incorporate linear motors but use electromagnetism only for propulsion, without levitating the vehicle. Such trains have wheels and are not maglevs. Maglev tracks, monorail or not, can also be constructed at grade (i.e. not elevated). Conversely, non-maglev tracks, monorail or not, can be elevated too. Some maglev trains do incorporate wheels and function like linear motor-propelled wheeled vehicles at slower speeds but [...] "take off" [...] and levitate at higher speeds.|$|E
2500|$|The Transrapid maglev {{system uses}} a {{synchronous}} longstator <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> for both propulsion and braking. It {{works like a}} rotating electric motor whose stator is [...] "unrolled" [...] along {{the underside of the}} guideway; instead of producing torque (rotation) it produces a linear force along its length. The electromagnets in the maglev vehicle which lift it also work as the equivalent of the excitation portion (rotor) of this linear electric motor. Since the magnetic travelling field works in only one direction, if there were to be several maglev trains on a given track section, they would all travel in the same direction thereby reducing the possibility of collision between moving trains.|$|E

In contrast to conventionell feed drives {{they offer a}} lot of advantages, such as high dynamics, low friction and simple design. But <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> are also well suited for ultraprecision purposes, which was tested at the Fraunhofer IPT and will be introduced in this paper...|$|R
50|$|In {{this design}} {{the rate of}} {{movement}} of the magnetic field is controlled, usually electronically, to track {{the motion of the}} rotor.

2500|$|High-speed {{transportation}} patents {{were granted}} to various inventors throughout the world. Early United States patents for a <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> propelled train were awarded to German inventor Alfred Zehden. The inventor was awarded [...] (14 February 1905) and [...] (21 August 1907). [...] In 1907, another early electromagnetic transportation system {{was developed by}} F. S. Smith. A series of German patents for magnetic levitation trains propelled by linear motors were awarded to Hermann Kemper between 1937 and 1941. An early maglev train was described in , [...] "Magnetic system of transportation", by G. R. Polgreen (25 August 1959). The first use of [...] "maglev" [...] in a United States patent was in [...] "Magnetic levitation guidance system" [...] by Canadian Patents and Development Limited.|$|E
2500|$|The {{drag force}} {{can be used}} to the {{electrodynamic}} system's advantage, however, as it creates a varying force in the rails that {{can be used as a}} reactionary system to drive the train, without the need for a separate reaction plate, as in most <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> systems. Laithwaite led development of such [...] "traverse-flux" [...] systems at his Imperial College laboratory. Alternatively, propulsion coils on the guideway are used to exert a force on the magnets in the train and make the train move forward. The propulsion coils that exert a force on the train are effectively a linear motor: an alternating current through the coils generates a continuously varying magnetic field that moves forward along the track. The frequency of the alternating current is synchronized to match the speed of the train. The offset between the field exerted by magnets on the train and the applied field creates a force moving the train forward.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{a million}} was {{originally}} budgeted {{to heat the}} third rail to prevent ice buildup, but later removed as a cost-cutting move. It was believed that the rapid operation (short headways) would keep the rail free of snow as the passing cars heated the rail. This proved not to work, and in operations at just the wrong conditions close to freezing the opposite occurred; when the train passed and heated the rail, microscopically thin layers of snow would be melted, and if the rail was below zero as a whole, the water would freeze to the rail and cause ice buildup. [...] Another retrofit was required to solve this problem, by adding wooden covers over the rail, a system used throughout Toronto's subway system. Even with these covers in place, the line can be shut down with any heavy snowfall that covers the fourth rail to a depth that fills {{the distance between the}} rail and the <b>linear</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
