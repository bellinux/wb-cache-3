We pour liquid plaster into the bucket and set it in constant rotational motion relative to the earth. A liquid substance assumes a parabolic profile when spinning at constant angular velocity relative to an inertial frame under the influence of an uniform vertical gravitational field. By keeping the bucket under rotation for a long time, the plaster solidifies into a parabolic format. We utilize this solidified plaster paraboloid as a model to construct a counter-mould of glass fibre and resin.

40|$|As product {{miniaturization}} {{is becoming}} widely popular, many microparts are being produced by microforming of sheets/foils, whose strength {{needs to be}} able to maintain structural stability of the micro-components. In addition, their strength and ductility of foils generally reduce with a reduction in the thickness due to the size effect. In this paper, we report the fabrication of an aluminum <b>laminate</b> <b>foil</b> using a combined process of accumulative roll bonding (ARB) and asymmetric rolling (AR). It was found that this improves both strength and ductility. TEM results show that the laminate structures produced by ARB develop an inhomogeneous microstructure with nanoscale grains and abnormal coarsening in some grains during AR processing. Both these effects result in an improved ductility and strength. Using these rolled products, micro-cups of very small wall thickness/cup diameter ratio (1 / 200) have been successfully fabricated by micro-deep drawing without the need for annealing...|$|R

A {{study on}} the germination and seedling development from pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) seeds following storage in different packaging materials was carried out at the Institute of Agricultural Research for Development (IRAD), Njombe Multipurpose Research Station in Cameroon. Germination tests were conducted at 30 days intervals during 24 weeks of seed conservation in the laboratory at ambient temperature. Seeds were prepared from 4 pepper varieties (Safi, Big sun, Thailande and Local) and stored in 5 packaging materials (glass vial, plastic vial, <b>laminated</b> aluminium <b>foil</b> packet, paper and plastic envelope). The experiment was {{laid out in a}} 4 x 5 factorial design (4 varieties of pepper x 5 packaging materials) making 20 treatments in 5 replications. At each germination test, germinated seeds were counted everyday during 15 days. To estimate seedling development, 5 seedlings from each pepper variety issued from each packaging material was grown during each germination test in a polythene bag filled with local topsoil. Each sample was repeated 10 times. Thirty days after sowing, observations were made on seedling development parameters. The results obtained show that germination rate is higher immediately after seed preparation for all pepper varieties.

Also, seedlings issued from seeds stored in <b>laminated</b> aluminium <b>foil</b> packets are more vigorous than those issued from seeds stored in paper and polythene envelopes during seed conservation period (6 months). The rapid loss of viability in pepper seeds stored in the two last packaging materials could be attributed to their permeability to air and humidity which accelerates seed ageing and deterioration...|$|R

40|$|The {{determination}} of the dynamic characteristics of joints connecting structural components is a not yet solved problem of great importance when one intends to establish a theoretical model of the dynamic behaviour of a complex structure.

40|$|In this paper, a {{developed}} textile design method combining {{laser engraving}} and foil lamination was explored. With the <b>foil</b> <b>laminating,</b> {{the surface of}} denim fabric shows shinning effect. After that, the foil-laminated denim samples were treated with laser engraving by adjusting the parameters, including resolution (dots per inch, dpi) at 20, 30, 40 and 50 dpi and the pixel time (microsecond, μs) at 120 and 180 μs to melt and evaporate the aluminum foil and some surface fibers. The properties of the laser-engraved foil-laminated denim fabric, including weight, tearing strength, air resistance, surface observation, color appearance, colorfastness and abrasion resistance, and some low-stress mechanical properties, were investigated. The experimental results revealed that the changes in these properties are mainly related to the melted and evaporated surface <b>laminated</b> aluminum <b>foil</b> and different sizes of cracks, wrinkles and pores formed on the fiber surface with the increment of laser energy applied. This study also revealed the potential of pattern creation with different values and reflective appearance for the embellishment of denim fabric combining the aluminum <b>foil</b> <b>laminating</b> method through the laser engraving process. With lower resolutions, engraved vague patterns with small laser beam dots can be achieved. While the treatment resolution increased, clear patterns could be performed.

40|$|Space {{electronic}} systems employ enclosures to shield sensitive components from space radiation. The purpose of shielding is to attenuate {{the energy and}} the flux of ionizing radiation as they pass through the shield material, such that the energy per unit mass (or dose) absorbed in silicon is sufficiently below the maximum dose ratings of electronic components. The received radiation amount varies significantly depending on several variables that include mission parameters (orbit, altitude, inclination and duration), spacecraft design (spacecraft wall thickness and panel-enclosure location). To achieve the optimum shielding with the minimum weight, all these variables {{have to be considered}} in the design. Energetic particles, mainly electrons and protons, can destroy or cause malfunctions in spacecraft electronics. The standard practice in space hardware is the use of aluminium as both a radiation shield and structural enclosure. Composite structures show potential for significant mass savings. However, conventional graphite epoxy composites are not as efficient shielding materials as aluminium because of their lower density, that is, for the same mass, composites provide 30 to 40 % less radiation attenuation than aluminium. A solution is to embed high density (atomic weight) material into the laminate.

Reel-to-reel fabrication differs from wafer processing, commonly used {{for research in}} organic devices mainly in two ways: Only flexible substrates, generally polymer foils, can be considered and coating or patterning {{has to be done}} in direction of the material flow. For solution based deposition spin coating is an often used method for fabrication of thin layers, but is no suitable way to achieve a continuous process flow. In this investigation spin coated layers of the soluble polymer semiconductor poly 3 -hexylthiophene (P 3 HT) are compared to layers, which are fabricated with reel-to-reel compatible methods like drop casting and blading. Influences on saturation current, carrier mobilities and threshold voltage can be observed and are related to the processing conditions. Another crucial step in fabrication of a polymer transistor is the deposition of a gate dielectric, which has to be thin, but shows high dielectric strength and has to be manufactured without pinholes.
