2500|$|In PAR 64s, Raylite reflectors and two {{pin base}} lamps {{are often used}} as a cheaper {{alternative}} as the lamp is replaced but the reflector remains. Lamps such as the 500 watt A1/244 can {{be as much as}} half the price of the sealed beam units. Par 64s also often run at 120V, in two-pair series channels, with a [...] "y" [...] Splitter at the dimmer. [...] Narrow, medium and wide Raylite reflectors are quite readily available. The two-blade (pin) Mogul <b>lamp</b> <b>connector</b> need not be replaced — this is integral to the Raylite reflector, although some Raylite reflectors have [...] "tails" [...] which then require connection to the mains flex {{with the use of a}} ceramic connector block (ideally fixed to the can's body).|$|E

50|$|Non-integrated CFLs {{have the}} ballast {{permanently}} {{installed in the}} luminaire, and usually only the fluorescent tube is changed at its end of life. Since the ballasts are placed in the light fixture, they are larger and last longer compared to the integrated ones, and they don't {{need to be replaced}} when the tube reaches its end-of-life. Non-integrated CFL housings can be both more expensive and sophisticated. They have two types of tubes: a bi-pin tube designed for conventional ballast, and a quad-pin tube designed for an electronic ballast or a conventional ballast with an external starter. A bi-pin tube contains an integrated starter, which obviates the need for external heating pins but causes incompatibility with electronic ballasts.Non-integrated CFLs can also be installed to a conventional light fixture using an adapter containing a built-in magnetic ballast.
