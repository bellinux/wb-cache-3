40|$|Device-related {{infection}} {{remains a}} major {{barrier to the}} use of biomaterial implants as <b>life-saving</b> <b>devices.</b> This study aims to examine the effectiveness and mechanism of action of surface attached dihydropyrrolones (DHPs), a quorum sensing (QS) inhibitor, against bacterial colonization. DHPs were covalently attached on glass surfaces via copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC) click reaction. The covalent attachment of DHP surfaces was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle measurements, and the antimicrobial efficacy of the DHP coatings was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and image analysis. The results demonstrated that covalently bound DHP compounds are effective in reducing the adhesion by up to 97 % (p < 0. 05) for both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, using the green fluorescent protein (Gfp) -based reporter technology, it is demonstrated that surface attached DHPs were able to repress the expression of a lasB-gfp reporter fusion of P. aeruginosa by 72 % (p < 0. 001) without affecting cell viability. This demonstrates the ability of the covalently bound QS inhibitor to inhibit QS and suggests the existence of a membrane-based pathway(s) for QS inhibition. Hence, strategies based on incorporation of QS inhibitors such as DHPs represent a potential approach for prevention of device-related infections. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Implantable {{cardiac rhythm}} {{management}} devices (CRMDs) such as permanent pacemakers and internal car-dioverter defibrillators (ICDs) utilize embedded computers and radios to monitor chronic disorders and treat patients. <b>Life-saving</b> <b>devices</b> like ICDs, for instance, include pacemaker tech-nology and {{are designed to}} communicate wirelessly with a nearby external device programmer (EDP) that can remotely read data and change settings {{without the need for}} surgery. An ICD implanted in a patient can sense a rapid heartbeat and administer an electric shock to restore normal heart rhythm. It is has been shown that current ICDs in the market can be reverse engineered and are prone to software radio-based attacks. The ICDs can be remotely disabled or be made to administer an electric shock at random. Existing defense mechanisms include a simple cryptographic approach where a symmetric-key based challenge-response protocol is used between the ICD and an authorized EDP. This approach does not scale. In the real world, large scale deployment and management of shared key material amongst various entities such as CRMDs, EDPs, hospitals, clinics, and ambulances is a major issue. In this paper, we investigate security policy issues applicable to the CRMD ecosystem and issues for architectures that enforce the policy. Given the nature of this domain, these solutions will need to balance security, privacy and risk. For instance, an unauthorized EDP may need to issue a command to the ICD in emergency situations...|$|E

40|$|It is envisaged {{that in our}} technologically {{advanced}} society, every person would have a biomedical device or implant in their life time. However, bacterial infections on these <b>life-saving</b> <b>devices</b> have emerged as a major problem. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop biomaterial surfaces which resist bacterial adhesion and colonisation. Melimine is a synthetic cationic peptide with excellent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Further, this peptide is not cytotoxic at active concentrations and is readily heat-sterilizable. In this study, we explored the ability of Melimine to prevent bacterial adhesion when covalently tethered on glass and FEP using two attachment strategies: non-specific attachment via azide linkers and site-directed attachment via maleimide linker. The melimine coated surfaces showed excellent activity against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus with up to 40 -fold reduction in bacterial adhesion compared to the untreated samples in vitro. The influence of tethering parameters were also examined, peptide concentration, orientation and linker reactivity {{were found to be}} important factors to consider for optimal activity. In vivo efficacy of melimine was also demonstrated with a 1 -log reduction in viable bacteria compared with the controls in a subcutaneous mouse model.

40|$|An {{automated}} external defibrillator (AED) is one of {{the greatest}} advancements in defibrillator technology in the past several decades. Its purpose is to treat sudden cardiac arrest, the leading cause of death in this country. An AED checks the heart’s rhythm and will dispatch an electric jolt when needed to reestablish the organ’s normal electrical pattern. The magic of this portable device is that anyone can use it and it is relatively inexpensive to purchase. Studies have shown that access to AEDs can improve the odds of surviving a cardiac arrhythmia outside of the hospital and the American Heart Association estimates that an AED can improve a person’s chances of surviving the cardiac event by 49 – 75 %. Not everyone shares the same enthusiasm for the widespread availability of AEDs. There is a patchwork of statutes, rules, and regulations concerning the use of AEDs, and a number of entities are fearful of liability issues. While airlines are mandated to have AEDs on commercial aircraft, and Congress encourages the placement of these <b>life-saving</b> <b>devices</b> in federal buildings, private industries have resisted most proposed laws that require the installation of an AED on their premises. Health clubs, shopping centers, hotels, and country clubs are examples of businesses in this category. Various theories have been advanced to defeat any proposed law that requires mandatory installation, but the bottom line seems to be a liability concern. This article will explore the history of AEDs, the legislation on the topic, and the cases that have arisen in an attempt to impose liability against an entity for the failure to have an AED on the premise during a cardiac event...|$|E
40|$|Literature review: Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) {{has been}} associated with reduced psychosocial functioning, and such reductions may be influenced by illness perceptions. Although one published review has explored the relationships between illness perceptions and emotional wellbeing in AF patients, it had a narrow focus and lacked robust quality appraisal. Thus, the aims of the current review were to systematically review relationships between illness perceptions and broader psychosocial outcomes in AF patients, and to quality appraise the available literature. Thirteen studies were elicited. Although findings were equivocal, studies identified that particular illness perceptions were related to and, in some cases, appeared to predict poorer psychosocial functioning in terms of reduced emotional wellbeing, poorer quality of life (QOL) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL), adjustment, and treatment seeking delay. It is recommended that the illness perceptions of AF patients are assessed, and modified where indicated. Further research is warranted and suggestions are provided. Empirical Study: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are potentially <b>life-saving</b> <b>devices.</b> However, ICD recipients and their partners may experience negative psychosocial consequences following implantation and any isolated device activations. Furthermore, ICDs may activate multiple times, with three or more activations within 24 hours being classed as an electrical storm (ES). Although ESs have been shown to cause psychological difficulties for ICD recipients, no studies have investigated the impact of ESs on partners. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six participants who had witnessed their partner suffering an ES. The data were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) and four superordinate themes were identified: ‘Feeling overwhelmed during the ES (all at sea) ’, ‘Challenges in post-ES adjustment’, ‘Trying to cope (not being becalmed) ’, and ‘Living and growing’. There is a need for professionals to engage with partners and support them prior to, and following ESs. Further research is warranted and suggestions are provided...|$|E

40|$|Cardiovascular implantable {{electronic}} devices (CIEDs) are <b>life-saving</b> <b>devices</b> programmed to detect cardiac arrhythmias and intervene with pacing or shocks to avoid cardiac death. Currently, {{three to four}} million Americans rely on CIEDs and this number is growing rapidly with approximately 400, 000 new device implantations each year. Worldwide, around one million new device implantations are performed annually. CIEDs consist of battery-powered pulse generators connected to the heart {{by one or more}} electrode wires, called "leads," embedded within a patient's vein. To achieve the maximum possible clinical benefit, modern CIEDs can automatically transmit data to the clinician's office through various media, such as email and text messaging, to allow for remote monitoring. This dissertation concentrates on improving the quality of care of patients with CIEDs, i. e., maximizing the expected lifetime of these patients, by focusing on three major challenges inherent to these devices: (i) cardiac leads fail stochastically and {{it is not clear whether}} to abandon them or to extract them, either immediately or at a later time; (ii) the average life span of CIED batteries is not as long as the average patient's expected lifetime and it is not clear when to replace the battery-powered pulse generators; (iii) the remote monitoring of CIEDs can adversely affect the battery's remaining lifetime and it is not clear how frequently the remote transmissions should be performed. We use methodologies including Markov decision processes as well as applied probability and statistics to formulate and analyze decision models that enable clinicians to provide patients with better quality of care. Using clinical data and expert opinion, we carefully calibrate the models concerning challenges (i) and (ii); for (iii), we provide insightful numerical examples for a stylized model. Our results suggest that behaving optimally can significantly extend patients' lives while simultaneously decreasing the burden on the healthcare system by reducing the number of surgeries, in-office visits, and so on, without compromising the patients' well-being...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular implantable {{electronic}} devices (CIEDs), such as pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices, {{have become the}} treatment of choice for cardiac rhythm disorders in subgroups of patients with heart disease. Due to the expanding indications for CIEDs {{and the availability of}} data supporting the clinical effectiveness of these devices, the number of CIED implants has increased significantly over the past decades. While in the past mortality reduction was the primary goal of CIED therapy, in recent years increasing attention has been paid towards assessing the impact of these <b>life-saving</b> <b>devices</b> on patients’ lives. Despite increased focus on the patient perspective, there are still several knowledge gaps that need to be filled in order to optimize the management and care for patients with a CIED. In the first two parts of the current dissertation, the course and determinants of patient-reported health status following CIED implantation and the impact of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) on prognosis in ICD and heart failure patients was explored. Findings indicate that levels of (disease-specific) health status vary considerably across subgroups of patients receiving an ICD or CRT-defibrillator device. Depending on the health status component that was measured, 4 - 7 different outcome trajectories were identified in the first 12 - 14 months after implantation. The different health status trajectories generally showed an initial small to large improvement between device implantation and short-term follow-up, followed by stabilization between short- and long-term follow-up. Overall, poorer health status was particularly associated with patients’ psychological profile (i. e., negative affectivity, anxiety, depression, use of psychotropic medication and Type D personality) and less with their clinical status (except for NYHA classification), which is consistent with earlier research. Furthermore, this dissertationcorroborates that PROs not only compromise the well-being of patients but also increase their risk of adverse clinical outcomes including premature death. In the third part of this dissertation, current and previous research on the effects of optimization of ICD programming on (unnecessary) ICD therapy and PROs was reviewed. In recent years, a series of important clinical trials have led to a shift in ICD programming towards less early and aggressive arrhythmia termination using in-device detection algorithms, prolonged detection duration, and no therapy delivery for slower and stable ventricular tachyarrhythmias, allowing them to terminate spontaneously. These efforts have significantly reduced the incidence of inappropriate ICD shocks (i. e., approximately 2 % at 1 -year). However, with respect to reducing appropriate but unnecessary antitachycardia pacing and shocks, there are still gains to be made. The ENHANCED Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator programming to reduce therapies and improve quality of life study (ENHANCED-ICD study), a prospective, single-arm safety monitoring study which was designed together with Tilburg University and implemented in the University Medical Center Utrecht, showed that programming a number of intervals to detectof 60 / 80 instead of 30 / 40 for ventricular tachyarrhythmia/ventricular fibrillation detection was safe for patients (N = 60) receiving a first-time ICD or CRT-defibrillator due to a primary or secondary prevention indication...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for approving medical devices [...] such as catheters and artificial hearts [...] to provide reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness. As part of this responsibility, FDA, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), reviews applications submitted by medical device companies for devices they wish to market in the United States, including devices that are new or those that constitute modifications to already approved devices. Prior to 2002, members of Congress, representatives of the medical device industry, and others expressed concern that FDA lacked the resources necessary to complete such reviews {{in a timely manner}} to ensure that patients have access to useful, possibly <b>life-saving,</b> <b>devices.</b> In response, Congress enacted the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA), which authorizes FDA to charge user fees for some device applications and not others. Revenues from the user fees, together with additional appropriations that were also authorized by MDUFMA, were intended to provide additional resources to FDA for improving the timeliness of device review. To help ensure that user fees are not financially prohibitive for small medical device companies, MDUFMA provides that companies qualifying as small businesses in a given fiscal year can receive fee discounts and, in certain cases, fee waivers. To qualify as a small business under MDUFMA, a company must submit information to FDA demonstrating that its annual revenues [...] including the revenues of any affiliate, partner, or parent firm [...] are at or below a certain threshold. MDUFMA originally set the threshold for small business qualification at $ 30 million, and in 2005, the threshold was increased to $ 100 million by the Medical Device User Fee Stabilization Act of 2005 (MDUFSA). All companies qualifying as small businesses under the $ 100 million threshold pay reduced fees when submitting applications subject to user fees. Originally, MDUFMA also provided that companies qualifying as small businesses receive a fee waiver the first time ever they submit one of certain applications that generally have higher fees. While MDUFSA raised the small business threshold to $ 100 million, it provided that only companies with annual revenues of $ 30 million or less could continue to receive fee waivers. FDA's authority to collect user fees will sunset October 1, 2007. Congress asked us to provide annual revenue information for companies participating in the MDUFMA user fee program to assist Congress as it determines whether changes to the threshold for small business qualification are needed. Revenue information is available for companies that qualify as small businesses, which submit annual revenue information to FDA, and publicly traded companies, which register securities with, and submit annual revenue information to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In this report, we provide revenue information for (1) companies that qualified as small businesses under the MDUFMA user fee program in fiscal year 2006 and (2) companies publicly traded in the United States that submitted device applications subject to user fees and did not qualify as small businesses under MDUFMA in fiscal year 2006. ...|$|E

For many people this can lead to depression, despite the fact that their physical medical condition is being successfully treated. As a result, I explored a wearable design concept for a patient-facing dashboard, which would help to alleviate some of these effects by (1) communicating to patients what is happening physically within their bodies, (2) promoting a sense of ownership over their bodies and their treatment, and (3) inspiring a feeling of control over their treatment outcomes and their lives...|$|R

40|$|The implantable cardioverter {{defibrillator}} (ICD) {{is often}} used in treatment and prevention of lethal cardiac arrhythmias in at-risk patients. Despite its established effectiveness, ICD therapy is associated with ongoing physical, emotional, and psychosocial distress that can impact patients' quality of life (QoL). For many patients living with chronic illness, religiosity may be central {{to dealing with the}} physical and psychosocial challenges they encounter. It is hypothesized that ICD patients who are more religious will demonstrate improved QoL. To date, there are no studies that have examined the influence of religiosity on general and disease-specific QoL in the ICD population.   The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between religiosity and QoL in ICD patients. Select variables (demographic, clinical, ICD specific, psychosocial, and religiosity) of the ICD population were explored to determine predictors of general (physical and mental health) and disease-specific QoL (patient acceptance of the device). Frankl's Motivational Theory of Meaning (1962) and Wilson and Cleary's Quality of Life Model (1995) provided the conceptual framework for this study.   Using a descriptive correlational design with purposive sampling, data were collected from 101 ICD recipients who were patients at a cardiology clinic in a southeastern state. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to assess relationships between study variables and identify the best predictors of QoL.   Study measures of religiosity did not relate to general QoL. However, there were significant correlations between religiosity and disease-specific QoL. Physical health (PH) was significantly correlated with number of comorbidities, age, and depression scores, with depression the strongest predictor of PH. Both anxiety and depression scores were identified as significant predictors of mental health (MH). Regarding disease-specific QoL, study findings indicated sixty-seven percent of the variability in patient acceptance was predicted by race, age, number of comorbidities, shock anxiety, depression, knowledge of device, and importance of religion.   Overall, ICD patients in this study who were more religious reported a greater acceptance of their implantable device. Religiosity, as well as other psychosocial variables in the ICD population, could prove effective coping strategies to adjustment with this <b>life-saving</b> <b>device</b> and provide a model for interventions.

Ours was the only ship that had this device; we were very proud of it, and had been anxious to give its powers a practical test. This thing was lashed to the garboard-strake of the main-to'gallant mizzen-yard amidships,[19] and {{there was nothing to do}} but cut the lashings and heave it over; it would do the rest. One day the cry of 'Man overboard!' brought all hands on deck. Instantly the lashings were cut and the machine flung joyously over. Damnation, it went to the bottom like an anvil! By the time that the ship was brought to and a boat manned, I was become but a bobbing speck on the waves half a mile astern and losing my strength very fast; but by good luck there was a common seaman on board who had practical ideas in his head and hadn't waited to see what the patent machine was going to do, but had run aft and sprung over after me the moment the alarm was cried through the ship. I had a good deal of a start of him, and the seas made his progress slow and difficult, but he stuck to his work and fought his way to me, and just in the nick of time he put his saving arms about me when I was about to go down. He held me up until the boat reached us and rescued us. By that time I was unconscious, and I was still unconscious when we arrived at the ship. A dangerous fever followed, and I was delirious for three days; then I come to myself and at once inquired for my benefactor, of course. He was gone. We were lying at anchor in the Bay and every man had deserted to the gold-mines except the commissioned officers. I found out nothing about my benefactor but his name--Burton Sanders--a name which I have held in grateful memory ever since. Every time I have been on the Coast, these twelve or thirteen years, I have tried to get track of him, but have never succeeded. I wish I could find him and make him understand that his brave act has never been forgotten by me. Harte, I would rather see him and take him by the hand than any other man on the planet." ...|$|R
40|$|Plastics - {{they are}} everywhere. " The first {{sentence}} {{of this book}} hints at the problem it seeks to address. The shear diversity of plastics materials has led to their use in products as varied as disposable packaging, <b>life-saving</b> medical <b>devices,</b> giant wind-turbine blades and tiny electronic components. Their prices and properties vary as widely, {{and they can be}} moulded, extruded, blown, formed, and shaped in many other ways. Traditionally made from petrochemicals, designers can now also choose from a range of natural materials. Performance will depend on chemical constitution, but also on the selection of processing aids and property modifiers which can be added to the basic material. For years, people have asked for a simple book to help them understand this complex subject. This is that book! Managers, sales personnel, industry newcomers, designers and end-users are all confronted with a bewildering range of technology and terminology by their colleagues, customers and suppliers. The Instant Expert: Plastics, Processing and Properties provides clear descriptions of the wide range of plastic materials, and explanations of the basic shaping and finishing processes. The author also talks about materials properties and testing, and provides some simple examples of why particular plastics are used in common or more challenging applications. Common abbreviations are explained. Readable from cover-to-cover, or easily referred to when questions arise, this book will be indispensible...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{electronic}} pacemakers are <b>life-saving</b> medical <b>devices,</b> their long-term performance in pediatric patients can be problematic owing to the restrictions imposed by a child's small size and their inevitable growth. Consequently, there is a genuine need for innovative therapies designed specifically for pediatric patients with cardiac rhythm disorders. We propose that a conductive biological alternative consisting of a collagen-based matrix containing autologously-derived cells could better adapt to growth, {{reduce the need for}} recurrent surgeries, and greatly {{improve the quality of life}} for these patients. In the present study, we describe a procedure for incorporating primary skeletal myoblast cell cultures within a hydrogel matrix to fashion a surgically-implantable tissue construct that will serve as an electrical conduit between the upper and lower chambers of the heart. Ultimately, we anticipate using this type of engineered tissue to restore atrioventricular electrical conduction in children with complete heart block. In view of that, we isolate myoblasts from the skeletal muscles of neonatal Lewis rats and plate them onto laminin-coated tissue culture dishes using a modified version of established protocols [2, 3]. After one to two days, cultured cells are collected and mixed with antibiotics, type 1 collagen, Matrigel™, and NaHCO 3. The result is a viscous, uniform solution that can be cast into a mold of nearly any shape and size [1, 4, 5]. For our tissue constructs, we employ type 1 collagen isolated from fetal lamb skin using standard procedures [6]. Once the tissue has solidified at 37 °C, culture media is carefully added to the plate until the construct is submerged. The engineered tissue is then allowed to furthe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background: Prospective {{comparative}} studies {{to predict the}} risk of hemodynamic deterioration in patients referred for transplantation were performed {{on the basis of}} standard invasive and non-invasive data and new wave intensity (WI) parameters. Methods and results: Study Group 1 consisted of 151 consecutive outpatients (age 48. 7 ± 12 years; 110 men) with end-stage dilative cardiomyopathy. Group 2, consisting of 11 consecutive patients (age 50 ± 11 years; 6 men) with sinus rhythm and “true ” decompensation, was used to create “critical values ” of WI. There were no demographic or somatic (weight and height) differences between the groups. The follow-up period of ambulatory patients was 31 ± 8 months. Non-invasive WI was studied in the common carotid artery. Complete invasive and non-invasive data were also recorded on the day of investigation. During follow-up 44 pts were lost; there were 15 cardiac deaths (10 %), <b>life-saving</b> ventricular assist <b>device</b> implantation in 10 (6. 6 %) and transplantation in 19 (12. 7 %). For statistical purposes this group was named the “events ” Group B (n = 44). A predisposing factor for events (death, “true ” decompensation and “urgent ” transplantation in ambulatory patients) was low first peak (“cut-off value ” assessed in Group 2 < 4100 mmHg*s) (OR 45. 6...|$|R
40|$|In groundbased {{tactical}} {{situations and}} prehospital settings, the tourniquet {{is used as}} a <b>life-saving</b> hemorrhage control <b>device.</b> It must completely stop blood flow, must be fast and simple to self-apply, and must require minimal training. However, an improperly designed or used tourniquet can cause loss of the limb, compromised limb salvage, and systemic effects harmful to the patient; all may result from excess tourniquet pressure, excess tourniquet time, or a tourniquet that is too narrow. Most existing prehospital tourniquets use technology from the 1800 ’s: mechanically tightened narrow bands that apply uncontrolled pressures (e. g. Spanish Windlass). In contrast, the modern pneumatic tourniquet is considered indispensable in common surgical procedures, and is now used thousands of times each day to completely occlude arterial blood flow in limbs continuously throughout surgeries lasting several minutes to several hours, and longer using appropriate techniques. Injury or compromise of limb recovery due to pneumatic tourniquet use in surgery is rare. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test a newly developed prehospital pneumatic tourniquet, which is based on proven surgical tourniquet designs. The new device has an inflatable bladder, a manual inflator, and a locking clamp. It weighs 220 g, packs to 570 cm 3, and fits arms and thighs up to 85 cm circumference. To demonstrate effectiveness at safe pressures, the new tourniquet was applied to adult volunteers. Arteria...|$|R

Less powerful predictors of the risk of deterioration were pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP), diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and E/A mitral wave relation (p = 0. 05). Conclusions: The new ventricular-arterial coupling parameter 1 st peak of WI can potentially be used to distinguish patients at high risk for true deterioration and death. This parameter can be used to predict the need for assist device implantation...|$|R
