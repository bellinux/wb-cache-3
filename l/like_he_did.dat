5|$|The Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that Wiggins had experienced marital strife, {{but that he}} would not entertain the thought of divorce; he wanted to ensure that his children did not grow up in a single-parent household <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{off-season}} Shero {{decided that the}} team would be more successful if he coached them like he had coached his minor league teams. Upon being elevated to the NHL, he {{had decided not to}} employ systems <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in the minors, stating that he had too much respect for NHL players. However, he decided that since he had the same kind of players on the Flyers as he did in the minors, he would use the same systems, becoming the first coach to employ systems.|$|E
5|$|Development {{started in}} early 2010 {{with the goals}} of {{reworking}} the character Falco Lombardi to mechanically play <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in Melee and increasing the accessibility of the gameplay style, but the project quickly evolved to a full-scale reworking of Brawl. The game's first demo build was released on February 7, 2011, and development continued until December 1, 2015, when the PMDT announced it would cease further development of Project M. The game has received positive comments from reviewers, amassed a player base of over 500,000, surpassed three million downloads, and been played in many professional tournaments.|$|E

5|$|Morgan {{had waited}} until her {{academic}} rank was secure before becoming pregnant. She {{had a son}} in 1923, {{the same year that}} she became a full professor. Colleagues were surprised when she had the baby, as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid the physical evidence of her pregnancy with her long laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague when she told him the news; he said if she had five children <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> she would have hardly noticed the new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her and cared for the baby so that Morgan could work uninterrupted.|$|E
5|$|In late 1916 he was {{approached}} by Fasih al-Ayyubi in hope that Quwatli could help him secure an escape route for his ailing father, Shukri al-Ayyubi, who was arrested by the Ottomans, <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> for Nasib al-Bakri. However, despite Quwatli's refusal to help, Ottoman authorities tracked down the contact and arrested both men. Quwatli was subjected to further torture to coerce him to reveal the names of his al-Fatat colleagues. In an attempt to prevent himself from surrendering the names, Quwatli tried to commit suicide. After cutting his wrists, Quwatli's life was saved {{at the last minute}} by fellow inmate, al-Fatat member and practicing doctor, Ahmad Qadri. He spent four more months in jail, before being released on bail by his relative, Shafiq al-Quwatli, who served as a deputy at the Ottoman Parliament, on 28 January 1917. His experience in jail and the story about his attempted suicide turned Quwatli into a nationalist hero in Syria.|$|E
5|$|Project M {{first began}} as a {{development}} project to rework the character Falco to play <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in Melee. The designers' goal {{at the time was}} for the game to be accessible to newcomers and encourage people to get better at the game, which was accomplished by creating a character roster that is more balanced. The mod's first demo was announced on January 15, 2011, with a release date of late January or early February in time for the Pound 5 tournament, where it was featured. It featured 14 of the 39 characters in Brawl, as well as new stages Brawl had not included. It was later given a solid date of February 7, 2011. A patch was later created to fix the demo's bugs and fine-tune the player's control of their movement direction after being attacked.|$|E

On 4 November 2009, Babel scored the opening goal against Lyon in a Champions League game, a strike from 25 yards in a 1–1 draw. Former Liverpool player Alan Hansen called upon Babel to play <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> against Lyon, as he still possessed {{the ability to be}} a 'top player'.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} points may be partly correct in themselves, but they leave {{unanswered}} {{the question of}} why Beck acted <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> A possible explanation is that he needed to repair his reputation: He was a politician and had during the First War of Schleswig 15 years earlier been passed over for promotion for criticism by Colonel Læssøe, and would probably suffer the same again, for in February during the battle of Sankelmark he left his unit while it was in battle.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the second}} championship-deciding {{collision}} in two years, Jackie Stewart interviewed Senna at the 1990 Australian Grand Prix (where Senna won pole and led for 61 laps before gearbox trouble {{forced him to}} slide off into a tyre barrier) and brought up a number of controversial collisions in which Senna had been involved {{over the last few}} years, stating that Senna had made more contact with other cars and drivers {{in the last four years}} than all the champions before him. An irritated Senna questioned how someone like Stewart, himself a triple world champion, could ask questions <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> knowing the pressure under which drivers raced.|$|E

In the final moments of the episode, Charles Xavier reveals that he witnessed the future in the mind of Apocalypse, and among the visions he saw was Magneto becoming an ally of the X-Men and training the New Mutants, <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in the comics.|$|E
25|$|Frankie Laine was {{somebody}} that everybody knew. He {{was a kind}} of a household word like Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin or Peggy Lee or Ella Fitzgerald—Frankie Laine {{was one of the great}} popular singers and stylists of that time…And his style…he was one of those artists who had such a unique stamp—nobody sounded <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> You could hear two notes and you knew who it was and you were right on the beam with it right away. And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability. — John Williams.|$|E
25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

25|$|Dungeon Keeper was {{announced}} in August 2013, although development began the previous year. It was scheduled for a winter release, and designed for touchscreens. According to senior producer Jeff Skalski, Mythic Entertainment had to make significant changes to Dungeon Keeper for mobile platforms, although there were aspects of the original games from Bullfrog Productions they wanted to keep, such as the humour. The intention was to give players an experience of the original Dungeon Keeper. Despite this, he stated {{that they were not}} trying to recreate the original games, or the cancelled Dungeon Keeper 3, but rather a mobile game for mobile systems. The colour palette was expanded to make the creatures easier to see on mobile phones. The role of traps was increased, and gameplay was made to focus as much on offence as defence. According to Skalski, the god-view facilitated the porting to touch-screen devices. The development team took into account feedback from fans on the internet, and their goal was to make the game free so many people could play it. Skalski emphasized that the game is built for typical mobile game patterns, which meant that {{it is supposed to be}} played for brief periods multiple times per day. He disagreed with assertions that it lacks the humour of the original, due to Richard Ridings (who, according to him, is a fan-favourite) providing the voice-overs <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> with the original Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2, which included over 500 lines of dialogue.|$|E
25|$|Sagan {{started his}} {{season at the}} Tour of Qatar, taking his first podium spot of the season on Stage 4 by {{finishing}} second. He finished second again the next day. He concluded the race first in the youth classification to win the white jersey. He subsequently headed to the Tour of Oman, failing to get his first season victory. He then participated to Tirreno–Adriatico, finishing second {{of the first and}} second stage. On Stage 6, Sagan took his first victory under the Tinkoff-Saxo colors in a flat stage which featured a lot of rain and breaks in the peloton. He finished the stage race in first in the points classification to earn the red jersey. He went on to compete in the Monument race Milan–San Remo, where he sprinted to a fourth position. In E3 Harelbeke, Sagan got clear of the main group with Geraint Thomas and Zdenek Stybar on the Oude Kwaremont with 41 kilometers left, but faded badly as Thomas attacked with 4 kilometers to go and finished 30th. Two days later, he finished tenth of Gent–Wevelgem, as only 39 riders finished the race. In April, he awarded himself the fourth place of the Tour of Flanders. He was chasing the leading duet with Greg Van Avermaet, but cracked in the finale, just <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in the E3 Harelbeke. At Paris-Roubaix, he was in a group chasing the leaders, but had a mechanical problem with his shifter and had to change his bike in the final 10 kilometers, costing him precious time. He finished 23rd.|$|E
