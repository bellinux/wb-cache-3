5|$|Racing back to {{the camp}}, she <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> on the camp from a tree, {{suddenly}} stopped by the voices of Tigerstar and his Clanmates. Soon she becomes frightened after Tigerstar discusses his plans to rule the forest with his Clanmates, including hiring BloodClan and setting a pack of dogs on ThunderClan. Extremely scared and changing her mind, Sasha flees, but before she can get far she is approached by Tigerstar who asks if she will join ShadowClan.|$|E
5|$|A quick cut later, the costumed {{character}} {{is looking at}} the camera again with hands at its sides. After a few more jump cuts in which they turn to the right and back again, the figure stands still, then looks to its left slowly. The figure <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the wall, with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E
5|$|His films also {{typically}} {{end with}} a death, which is portrayed not as a tragedy, but as a happy moving on where the deceased <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> happily at the world below. Between Heaven and Earth ends with a birth, but it is similarly handled the passing of a character into a new world. This pattern is continued in Mr. Nobody, where two deaths open the film and a unique twist on death {{at the end of}} the film conveys a wistful sense of happiness.|$|E

5|$|Marilena and Giani {{were in fact}} in her apartment; {{the girl}} goes to the {{restroom}} for a minute. Andrei manages to sneak into the apartment, and watches how, while still talking to Giani, Marilena cuts her jugular vein. After realizing what had happened, Giani becomes frightened and runs away; the pimp sees him leaving in a rush, so {{he goes to the}} apartment to see what happened. Meanwhile, Andrei goes into the room and <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> at Marilena who is lying down, with blood spilled over her. The news about Marilena's suicide spread fast around the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|The {{singer is}} in the dark behind a busy highway, sobbing and peeling petals off a white rose {{in a game of}} He loves me... he loves me not as a montage is playing of images of Selena and her former lover. Selena then sings on a {{staircase}} in a white dress, accompanied by an orchestra. She considers crashing her ex-lover's beach wedding, but instead runs away in tears. Selena's ex-lover and his new wife kiss, and a video plays in which he kisses Selena's hands. He then embraces his wife as Selena <b>looks</b> <b>down,</b> sobbing.|$|E
5|$|In the foreground, {{a drunken}} freemason, {{identified}} by his apron and set square medallion as the Worshipful Master of a lodge, is being helped home by his Tyler, as {{the contents of}} a chamber pot are emptied onto his head from a window. In some of the prints, a woman standing back from the window <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> on him, suggesting that his soaking is not accidental. The freemason is traditionally identified as Sir Thomas de Veil, {{who was a member of}} Hogarth's first Lodge, Henry Fielding's predecessor as the Bow Street magistrate, and the model for Fielding's character Justice Squeezum in The Coffee-House Politician (1730). He was unpopular for his stiff sentencing of gin-sellers, which was deemed to be hypocritical as he was known to be an enthusiastic drinker. He is supported by his Tyler, a servant equipped with sword and candle-snuffer, who may be Brother Montgomerie, the Grand Tyler.|$|E

5|$|The mural {{painted on}} {{the dome of the}} apse (pictured right) depicts Jesus seated on a cloud, red and golden rays {{radiating}} out of his golden halo. God the Father, pictured as a white-bearded man with triangular halo, <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> from a cloud above Jesus. A dove with a white halo, representing the Holy Spirit, flies just below God, wings outstretched, completing the Trinity. Above Jesus fly four cherubim. Seated to Jesus' right is Mary, his mother, and to his left Saint John the Baptist. On the same cloud as Jesus, three angels flank on each side. Slightly below Jesus, Mary, and John, two more flanking angels are depicted kneeling on their own clouds and swinging censers. Under the entire scene, a banner displays Gloria in Excelsis Deo.|$|E
5|$|The way the {{painting}} shows {{the progress of}} time is also without precedent in Western art. The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome {{is seen in the}} corpse of a man, splayed {{on the ground in the}} lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible. The victim is portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> on the mutilated body.|$|E
5|$|Victorious after {{defeating}} the King in the war, Meliara returns to Tlanth {{to improve its}} dilapidated castle with the family's new riches. One day, Bran visits her, accompanied by his new fiance Lady Nimiar Argaliar and the Marquis of Shevraeth, who is preparing to take the throne of Remalna. Now accustomed to the fine fashions of court, Bran expresses dismay at finding Mel dressed in old clothes - she never before cared about her appearance. Mel becomes shy and embarrassed about her lack of courtly finesse and grace, and avoids the visitors, especially Shevraeth, who she fears <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> on her. Nimiar convinces Mel to return with them to court, and begins to teach her the essential of life there, including its customs, clothing styles, and hand fan language.|$|E

5|$|A {{young boy}} named Cooper and his girlfriend, Amber, are seen searching frantically for {{civilisation}} after {{they take a}} wrong turn. They are caught in a storm and head to a nearby mansion to seek shelter. Once outside, Cooper checks his map, but is unaware that someone is watching. Baron von Ghoul, the game's main antagonist, <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> from his window and orders two gargoyles to retrieve Cooper and Amber. Amber is kidnapped by the gargoyles and is taken into the Ghouly Mansion, with Cooper in pursuit. Once inside the mansion, Cooper realises that Amber {{is nowhere to be}} seen in the Grand Hallway. Crivens, the mansion's butler, tells him to go to the archives where Amber is held. On the way, a huge group of boxing skeletons challenge Cooper to a boxing match, with Cooper emerging victorious. Upon reaching the archives, Cooper finds Amber being held hostage by a mad scientist named Dr. Krackpot. Krackpot then shoots Amber with his laser rifle and she transforms into a horrible creature.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{is invited}} by her boss Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to spend Christmas {{with him to}} help him deal with a visit from his mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). Liz finds it strange that Jack's fiancée Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) will not spend the holiday with him and {{immediately}} realizes that Jack has not told his mother about Avery's pregnancy. Avery becomes angry, but she and Liz convince him to tell her which he promises to do. Jack tells Colleen about the news {{but she is not}} excited about the pregnancy as Jack and Avery are not married. To get back at her, Jack calls his biological father Milton Greene (Alan Alda), the father she never told him he had, and invites him to spend Christmas with him, and does not inform him that Colleen will be present. The next day, Milton arrives and Jack explains the reason for his visit is so that he can ambush Colleen as she <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> on his relationship with Avery. Later, Avery arrives and is angered about what Colleen said about her relationship with Jack. Liz tries to warn Colleen about Jack's plan but to no avail. She is shocked to see Milton, but immediately figures out what Jack is up to. Colleen gets even with Jack by faking a heart attack, which causes Milton and Avery to feel sorry for her thus abandoning their plan to reprimand Colleen. At the hospital, Avery reveals that she and Jack had planned to elope over New Year's and extends an invitation to everyone. After the announcement, Liz leaves and travels to White Haven, Pennsylvania to spend Christmas with her family.|$|E
