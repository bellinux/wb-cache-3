5|$|Many of {{the strongest}} {{recorded}} tropical cyclones weakened prior to their eventual landfall or demise. However, three of the storms remained intense enough at landfall to be considered some {{of the strongest}} landfalling hurricanes– three of the eleven hurricanes on the list constitute the three most intense Atlantic landfalls in recorded history. The 1935Labor Day hurricane made landfall at peak intensity, making it the most intense Atlantic landfall. Though it weakened slightly before its eventual landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula, Hurricane Gilbert maintained a pressure of 900mbar (hPa; 26.58inHg) at landfall, making its landfall the second strongest. Similarly, Hurricane Dean made landfall on the peninsula, though it did so at peak intensity and with a higher barometric pressure; its <b>landfall</b> <b>marked</b> the third strongest in Atlantic hurricane history.|$|R

50|$|On 18/19 April the Luftwaffe {{prepared}} {{an attack}} on London using the same approach as the Bristol operation. I./KG 6 and II./KG 2 marked the target area from 8 and 6,000 ft respectively. The bomber stream was ordered to converge on the Funkfeuer at Noordwijk on the Dutch coast. <b>Landfall</b> was <b>marked</b> at Leiston and six lux buoys were dropped on route to mark the bomber's path. A turning point was ordered at Newmarket. The bomb run was to take place at 10,000 ft with a gradual descent to Dymchurch and over to Boulogne. Two kickebein stations at Den Helder and Bergen supported the operations. The Caen, Cherbourg and Morlaix stations were also in use for this operation as the Luftwaffe made greater attempts to improve navigation.|$|R
5|$|About {{six hours}} after Lam moved ashore, Cyclone Marcia made {{landfall}} along Queensland, {{making it the}} first time on record that two storms of at least Category4 intensity struck Australia on the same day. Lam was the first severe tropical cyclone to strike Northern Territory since Cyclone Monica in April 2006. In addition, Lam's <b>landfall</b> on February19 <b>marked</b> the third latest date for Australia to receive its first landfall, and the latest since 1988.|$|R
5|$|When Megh passed near Socotra, {{residents}} {{were just beginning}} to return after the previous cyclone, and many had to evacuate again. Additional heavy rainfall and high winds lashed the island, which destroyed 500homes and damaged another 3,000. The consecutive storms damaged 785fishing boats, left 80% of the roads impassible, and caused an island-wide power outage. Megh killed 18people on Socotra and injured another 60. The heavy damage on the island prompted nearby countries and international organizations to deliver relief goods and medical teams. Later, Megh brought torrential rainfall and high waves to northern Somalia, killing livestock and damaging schools. The storm's final <b>landfall</b> in Yemen <b>marked</b> little rainfall or effects.|$|R
5000|$|With {{his friends}} Alex Calder and Roger Horrocks, Davis co-edited the {{magazine}} And which ran for four issues between 1983 and 1985. This provided {{a platform for}} some of New Zealand’s most experimental prose and poetry writers, and also broke new ground in literary criticism by applying post-structuralist theory to local literature and art. The magazine “made a considerable impact on contemporary New Zealand literary studies” according to Hugh Lauder, editor of <b>Landfall.</b> [...] And <b>Mark</b> Williams wrote in The Journal of New Zealand Literature: “And went further towards initiating that long awaited renovation of local literary habits than any previous New Zealand little magazine since Freed, and perhaps since Phoenix.” ...|$|R

5|$|Allison {{remained}} somewhat disorganized, as no eye was visible, {{even when}} Reconnaissance flights confirmed {{that it was}} at hurricane intensity. The storm maintained itself as a minimal hurricane throughout the day on June 4 before it began {{to turn to the}} northeast, in response to southwesterly shear. Late that evening, the storm began to weaken, dropping back to tropical storm intensity as it approached the Florida Big Bend area. The intensity leveled off on June 5 until it made landfall that morning. Allison made its first landfall at about 10:00 am EDT (1400 UTC) near Alligator Point, Florida as a high-end tropical storm with 70mph (110km/h) winds. It briefly re-emerged over Apalachee Bay and made another <b>landfall</b> near St. <b>Marks,</b> Florida about one hour later with 65mph (100km/h) winds. Operationally, Allison was considered a hurricane until it made landfall, and was considered the earliest hurricane landfall in the United States for some time.|$|R
50|$|A {{tropical}} depression developed near Turks and Caicos Islands on June 26. Moving west-northwestward, the depression struck Great Inagua Island in the Bahamas. By 12:00 UTC the following day, the storm curved northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm. While situated near Andros around 12:00 UTC on June 28, the cyclone peaked with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). About eight hours later, it made landfall near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico near Cedar Key early on June 30, before making <b>landfall</b> near St. <b>Marks</b> close to 14:00 UTC with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). Although the system quickly weakened to a {{tropical depression}}, it remained a tropical cyclone while {{moving in a}} semicircular path across the Southeastern United States. Early on July 3, the storm emerged into the Atlantic near Beaufort, South Carolina. Around this time, Charleston observed a barometric pressure of , the lowest {{in relation to the}} system. The storm moved east-southeastward and continued weakening, until dissipating between Bermuda and Grand Bahama late on July 4.|$|R
50|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic {{from the west}} coast of Africa between August 16 and August 17. The wave failed to develop for several days due to its quick movement and dry air. Deep convection eventually consolidated and a circulation finally developed by August 28, with a tropical depression developing at 18:00 UTC, about 60 mi (100 km) south-southeast of Key West, Florida. Initially, the depression moved westward, until a break in a ridge caused it to move northeastward early on August 31. Around that time, the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Hermine. The storm steadily intensified into an 80 mph (130 km/h) Category 1 hurricane by early on September 2, becoming the first hurricane to form in the Gulf of Mexico since Ingrid in 2013. Hermine made <b>landfall</b> near St. <b>Marks,</b> Florida, at 05:30 UTC. After moving inland, Hermine quickly weakened and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 3 near the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The remnant system meandered offshore the Northeastern United States before dissipating over southeastern Massachusetts on September 8.|$|R

Late on September 5, Frances picked up speed due to a strengthening high pressure system to its north and crossed the Florida Peninsula, emerging over the Gulf of Mexico near Tampa as a tropical storm. After a short trip over the Gulf of Mexico, Frances made a second <b>landfall</b> near St. <b>Marks,</b> Florida. Frances headed inland, weakening to a tropical depression and causing heavy rainfall over the southern and eastern United States. As Tropical Depression Frances turned northeast, United States meteorologists at the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center continued issuing advisories on the system until it crossed the Canada–United States border into Quebec, where heavy rainfall also fell.|$|R
