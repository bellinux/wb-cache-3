50|$|The {{mechanism}} of seed dispersal via animal link vectors (endozoochoric dispersal) may explain how most Burseraceae {{were able to}} expand their range so efficiently across the globe. Beiselia, Boswellia, and Triomma have dry fruits better suited for wind dispersal, but most Burseraceae have fleshy, edible fruit that is eaten by many animal dispersers. The seeds may provide a high reward in fat (24-73%) and protein (2.7-25.9%) if digested, but many animals eat just the fleshy part of the fruit and either discard the endocarp right away or excrete it some time later. Some known Burseraceae fruit consumers include hornbills (Buceros bicornis, Ceratogyma atrata, C. cylindricus, Penelopides panini), oilbirds (Steatnoris caripensis), fruit pigeons, warblers, vireos, orioles, flycatchers, tanagers, woodpeckers, loeries, primates (Cercopithecus spp., <b>Lophocebus</b> albigena), lemurs (Varecia variegate subsp. variegate), and sun bears (Helarctos malayanus).

50|$|The {{crowned eagle}} {{occupies}} a unique niche, {{as it is}} the only bird in which primates are the most commonly taken prey at the species level. While at least a dozen other accipitrids opportunistically hunt small or young monkeys, only the harpy eagle and, possibly, crested eagle of the neotropics have diets where primates may locally outnumber other prey. However, New World monkeys are generally smaller and less formidable than Old World monkeys. Also, both other eagles may prefer different prey where available: harpy eagles primarily take sloths, which can be as heavy as a colobus or mangabey but are much slower and less able to defend themselves, while crested eagles take a variety of tropical birds and arboreal mammals. Other large eagles have been confirmed to hunt adult Old World monkeys, including martial eagles, Verreaux's eagles, mountain hawk-eagles and Philippine eagles, whose generic scientific name and old common was even the monkey-eating eagle, but all are believed to rely on non-primate prey for the majority of their diet. The favored group in the crowned eagles diet is certainly the Cercopithecus genus. In Kibale National Park, Uganda, the red-tailed monkey (Cercopithecus ascanius) was the most represented prey species, making up 40% of the remains. Slightly larger monkeys, such as western red colobus (Piliocolobus badius), mantled guereza (Colobus guereza) and grey-cheeked mangabey (<b>Lophocebus</b> albigena) were secondary in the prior study and, altogether, primates made up 82.2% of the remains from two nests there. A total of 88% of the remains found around crowned eagle nests in the Ituri Rainforest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were from primates: blue monkey (Cercopithecus mitis), red-tailed monkey, Wolf's mona monkey (C. wolfi), western red colobus and a mixture of mangabeys and black-and-white colobus. In 16 nests in the Ivory Coast's TaÃ¯ Forest, more than 60% of remains around the eyries were monkeys and more than 45% of remains were from Cercopithecus monkeys. About half of the Cercopithecus remains were from Diana monkey (C. diana; 44 items from 28 adults and 16 immatures), with the other half from Campbell's mona monkey (C. campbelli) and lesser spot-nosed monkey (C. petaurista), which were indistinguishable as remains. Other represented monkeys in the TaÃ¯ Forest included the Western red colobus, the olive colobus (Procolobus verus) and the king colobus (Colobus polykomos). The diet is, by necessity, more diverse in Kiwengwa/Pongwe Forest Reserve in the Matumbi Hills of Tanzania but the blue monkey was still the most represented prey species, making up 20% of the remains. In one nest in the prior study, the Blue monkey made up more than 90% of the remains. Where they overlap in range, the vervet monkey can be quite prominent as prey for crowned eagles, as their relatively small size, diurnal and terrestrial habits may make them more vulnerable.|$|E
40|$|Numerous biomolecular {{studies from}} the past 20 years have {{indicated}} that the large African monkeys Papio, Theropithecus, and Mandrillus have a diphyletic relationship with different species groups of mangabeys. According {{to the results of}} these studies, mandrills and drills (Mandrillus) are most closely related to the torquatusâ€“galeritus group of mangabeys placed in the genus Cercocebus, whereas baboons (Papio) and geladas (Theropithecus) are most closely related to the albigenaâ€“aterrimus mangabeys, now commonly placed in the genus <b>Lophocebus.</b> However, there has been very little morphological evidence linking mandrills {{on the one hand and}} baboons and geladas on the other with different groups of mangabeys.

Morphological findings are compared with genetic measures on the same populations. Papionine biological diversity has received extensive study recently. Unlike recurrent taxonomic rearrangements of disjunct Linnaean categories, our investigations focus on comparisons of phenostructure and zygostructure (Jolly 1993) {{in order to test}} hypotheses concerning broader patterns of early hominin evolutionary continuity (Henneberg and Thackeray 1995, Henneberg 1997, Henneberg and de Miguel 2004, Eckhardt 2000). Our primary data set comprises â‰¤ 66 measurement points on 1348 cranial specimens distributed among 42 nominal species and genera of papionine primates (with taxon sample sizes ranging from 1 to 88); data collection is continuing and being extended to elements of the postcranial skeleton. Given the large and expanding size of our data set, only selected findings are reported here. For example, a maximum parsimony tree of mitochondrial COII (Disotell 1992) groups Cercocebus with Mandrillus, while <b>Lophocebus</b> is placed closer to the pairing of Theropithecus with Papio. However, a matrix of distances between cranial vault points normalized by geometric means shows that Cercocebus differs by â‰¥ 5 % from Mandrillus in three times as many comparisons as Cercocebus differs from <b>Lophocebus,</b> and six times as many comparisons as <b>Lophocebus</b> in turn differs from Mandrillus. Clearly, morphometric differences can misrepresent genetic distances drastically.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In 2005, a new primate {{species from}} Tanzania, the kipunji, was {{described}} and {{recognized as a}} member of the mangabey genus <b>Lophocebus.</b> However, molecular investigations based upon a number of papionins, including a limited sample of baboons of mainly unknown geographic origin, identified the kipunji as a sister taxon to Papio and not {{as a member of}} <b>Lophocebus.</b> Accordingly, the kipunji was separated into its own monotypic genus, Rungwecebus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compare available mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data from the voucher specimen of Rungwecebus to other papionin lineages, including a set of geographically proximal (parapatric) baboon samples. Based on mitochondrial sequence data the kipunji clusters with baboon lineages that lie nearest to it geographically, i. e. populations of yellow and chacma baboons from south-eastern Africa, and thus does not represent a sister taxon to Papio. Nuclear data support a Papio+Rungwecebus clade, but it remains questionable whether Rungwecebus represents a sister taxon to Papio, or whether it is nested within the genus as depicted by the mitochondrial phylogeny. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study clearly supports a close relationship between Rungwecebus and Papio and might indicate that the kipunji is congeneric with baboon species. However, due to its morphological and ecological uniqueness Rungwecebus more likely represents a sister lineage to Papio and experienced later introgressive hybridization. Presumably, male (proto-) kipunjis reproduced with sympatric female baboons. Subsequent backcrossing of the hybrids with kipunjis would have resulted in a population with a nuclear kipunji genome, but which retained the yellow/chacma baboon mitochondrial genome. Since only one kipunji specimen was studied, it remains unclear whether all members of the new genus have been impacted by intergeneric introgression or rather only some populations. Further studies with additional Rungwecebus samples are necessary to elucidate the complete evolutionary history of this newly-described primate genus...|$|E
40|$|WOS: 000246646500010 International audienceThe authors {{examined}} the effects of task complexity and posture on laterality and compared lateralization during different tasks in 9 captive grey-cheeked mangabeys (<b>Lophocebus</b> albigena) during spontaneous food processing and 3 experimental tasks. Comparisons with data of red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus torquatus; semiterrestrial species) were used. Less than half the monkeys were lateralized for simple everyday activities, but 6 were lateralized for complex daily activities. Moreover, all the monkeys were lateralized when performing experimental tasks. Laterality at the group level was found for the bipedal task: Mangabeys were right-handed.

40|$|Seasonal {{fluctuations}} in resource abundance often cause primates {{to change their}} feeding behavior and ecology. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the response of a largely frugivorous monkey, the grey-cheeked mangabey (<b>Lophocebus</b> albigena), to seasonal variations in fruit abundance. We used 15 -min scan sampling to quantify feeding, activity, and habitat use by monkeys between February and December 1998 in the Dja Reserve, Cameroon. L. albigena were found to have omnivorous feeding habits, consuming the fruits, seeds, leaves, and flowers of 132 plant species. Although monkeys fed from many plant species, only five plant species accounted for 45 % of all feeding records. The number of feeding observations on a plant species was significantly correlated with its fruit production. L. albigena responded to fruit-lean periods by shift-ing from a diet dominated by fruit to one dominated by seeds, flowers, and young leaves. This diet shift coincided with greater use of swamp habitat and higher dietary diversity. L. albigena spent the greatest per...|$|E

Here we present results from a 9 -yr (2004 â€“ 2012) study of female reproductive performance in relation to motherâ€™s age and rank, presence of immigrant males, rainfall, and fig fruit abundance in four groups of gray-cheeked mangabeys (<b>Lophocebus</b> albigena) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We found that females had a rank- and age-specific reproductive pattern, with high-ranking females maturing earlier, having their first births earlier, and exhibiting significantly slower reproductive aging than low-ranking females. We also found that both immigrant and resident males were associated with higher birth rates. Finally, we found that reproduction was aseasonal and did not correlate with rainfall, but that births correlated positively with the abundance of fruits of Ficus spp. Our results show broad similarities between arboreal, forest-dwelling gray-cheeked mangabeys and their more terrestrial, open habitat-dwelling papionin relatives {{in the importance of}} dominance rank in estrous cycle initiation, first reproduction, and reproductive aging...|$|E
40|$|Frugivorous forest {{primates}} face {{a continual}} challenge to locate ripe fruit {{due to the}} poor visibility characterizing a heavily vegetated habitat and the spatial and temporal unpredictability of their fruit sources. We present two hypotheses regarding fruit finding in gray-cheeked mangabeys (<b>Lophocebus</b> albigena). The first hypothesis is that mangabeys monitor nonfruiting fig trees by visiting and checking them for fruit {{at a higher rate}} than control trees that do not produce preferred fruit. We test this hypothesis by comparing rates of visitation to focal fig trees and control trees. The second hypothesis is that mangabeys use sym-patric frugivore loud calls to locate fruit sources. We test this hypothesis (1) observationally, by comparing the rates at which mangabeys visit calling sites of sympatric frugivores and matched control areas; and (2) experimentally, by following mangabey responses to playbacks of tape-recorded calls: the black-and-white-casqued hornbill (Bycanistes subcylindricus) long call, the great blue turaco (Corythaeola cristata) rattling kok, the adult male mangabey whoopgobble, and the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) pant hoot.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Among social vertebrates, immigrants may incur a substantial fitness cost when {{they attempt to}} join a new group.

We here examine whether dispersing males tend to move into groups containing fathers or brothers in gray-cheeked mangabeys (<b>Lophocebus</b> albigena) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We sampled blood from 21 subadult and adult male mangabeys in 7 social groups and genotyped them at 17 microsatellite loci. Twelve genotyped males dispersed to groups containing other genotyped adult males during the study; in only 1 case did the group contain a probable male relative. Contrary to the prediction that dispersing males would follow kin, relatively few adult male dyads were likely first- or second-degree relatives; opportunities for kin-biased dispersal by mangabeys appear to be rare.

40|$|The {{power stroke}} of {{mastication}} has been traditionally {{divided into two}} parts, one which precedes centric occlusion, and the other which follows it- 2 Ì† 2 Phase I 2 Ì† 2 and 2 Ì† 2 Phase II, 2 Ì† 2 respectively. Recent studies of primate mastication have called into question the role of Phase II in food processing, as they have found little muscle activity or accompanying bone strain following centric occlusion. That said, many researchers today look to Phase II facets to relate diet to patterns of dental microwear. This suggests the need to reevaluate microwear patterns on Phase I facets. Here we use texture analysis to compare and contrast microwear on facets representing both phases in three primate species with differing diets (Alouatta palliata, Cebus apella, and <b>Lophocebus</b> albigena). Results reaffirm that microwear patterns on Phase II facets better distinguish taxa with differing diets than do those on Phase I facets. Further, differences in microwear textures between facet types for a given taxon may themselves reflect diet. Some possible explanations for differences in microwear textures between facet types are proposed...|$|E
