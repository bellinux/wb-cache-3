The electrostatics were designed by David Williamson, and the company's founder, Peter Walker, from a principle elaborated by Edward W. Kellogg for General Electric that was granted a patent in 1934. However, more immediately, a book published in the US in 1954 extolling the scientific merits of the electrostatic [...] transducer inspired Walker to develop an electrostatic <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>of</b> his own; this was technologically enabled by the Mylar film developed by Dupont that came to market in 1949. Walker demonstrated a prototype electrostatic panel speaker (with exceptional clarity in the midrange), and a full-frequency infinite baffle speaker (with ample bass response) at the British Sound Recording Association Annual Exhibition in May 1955. After more research, the large panel speaker with better response over the whole frequency range was demonstrated to the Physical Society in March 1956. The ESL entered commercial production in 1957, and was discontinued only in 1985.|$|E

The number <b>of</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> at head-height, the number <b>of</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> not at head-height, and the relative level between head-height and non-head-height layers were all found to be statistically significant in terms of perceived diffuseness.
