40|$|Motivated by {{the search}} for {{geometric}} observables in nonperturbative quantum gravity, we define a notion of coarse-grained Ricci curvature. It {{is based on a}} particular way of extracting the local Ricci curvature of a smooth Riemannian manifold by comparing the distance between pairs of spheres with that of their centres. The quantum Ricci curvature is designed for use on non-smooth and discrete metric spaces, and to satisfy the key criteria of scalability and computability. We test the prescription on a variety of regular and random piecewise flat spaces, mostly in two dimensions. This enables us to quantify its behaviour for short <b>lattices</b> <b>distances</b> and compare its large-scale behaviour with that of constantly curved model spaces. On the triangulated spaces considered, the quantum Ricci curvature has good averaging properties and reproduces classical characteristics on scales large compared to the discretization scale.

30|$|The {{observed}} arrays {{are due to}} {{the microscopic}} structure of the microemulsion phase where the nanocrystals have been grown and to the deposition-drying process. The chosen, high-conductivity microemulsion where the synthesis takes place is composed {{of a network of}} long cylinders, which explains the high value of conductivity κ. As the reduction reaction takes place in the confined space defined by these channels, the resulting nanoparticles do not randomly disperse in the volume of the sample, but instead they remain aligned following the geometry of the micelles. When the samples are deposited on a substrate, the nanoparticles follow the ordering the microemulsion acquires. As isooctane evaporates, the ethylene glycol-rich cylinders pack in a hexagonal structure, with the particles in the core of the aggregates (Figure  1). Thus, the order observed in Figure  3 a,b,c,d is reminiscent of the order in the microemulsion structure. This conclusion is confirmed by an estimation of the <b>lattice</b> <b>distance</b> a, in terms of the micelle volume fraction ϕmic in a hexagonal array. On geometrical grounds, it is straightforward to show that ϕ_mic=π/ 2 √(3)(d/a)^ 2, where d is the micelle diameter (it corresponds roughly to the diameter of the nanoparticle lines). If we evaluate the <b>lattice</b> <b>distance</b> from this expression using the experimental value for d and ϕmic, we find a = 63 nm. The agreement is reasonably good with the experimental value a = 70 nm.|$|E

By {{employing the}} infinite matrix product state representation with the infinite time evolving block decimation method, a finite string correlation for extremely large <b>lattice</b> <b>distances</b> is directly observed, contrast to an extrapolated extreme value for finite size chains. We {{find that a}} topological quantum phase transition occurs between two different phases separated and characterized by two different long-range string orders {{in the space of}} bond-alternating interactions. Also, the critical exponent β from the long-range string orders is obtained as β= 1 / 12 and the central charge at the critical point is obtained as c ≃ 1, which shows that the topological phase transition belongs to the Gussian universality class. In addition, it is shown that, for the topological quantum phase transition, the phase boundary can be captured by the singular behavior of the von Neumann entropy and the pinch point of the fidelity per site.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{strategy}} for large volume non-perturbative renormalization which alleviates the window problem by reducing cut-off effects. We perform a proof-of-concept study using position space renormalization scheme and the CLS N_f= 2 + 1 ensembles generated at 5 different lattice spacings. We show that in the advocated strategy results for the renormalization constants are to a large extend independent of the specific lattice direction used to define the renormalization condition. Hence, very short <b>lattice</b> <b>distances</b> become accessible even on coarse lattices and the contact with perturbation theory can be performed at much higher energy scales. Our results include non-perturbatively estimated renormalization constants for quark bilinear operators in the scalar, pseudoscalar and axial-vector channels using position space renormalization scheme which we subsequently translate to the MS scheme perturbatively at 1. 5 GeV.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} known that there exist short paths between vertices {{in a network}} showing the small-world effect. Yet vertices, for example, the individuals living in society, usually {{are not able to}} find the shortest paths, due to the very serious limit of information. To theoretically study this issue, here the navigation process of launching messages toward designated targets is investigated on a variant of the one-dimensional small-world network (SWN). In the network structure considered, the probability of a shortcut falling between a pair of nodes is proportional to r^-α, where r is the <b>lattice</b> <b>distance</b> between the nodes. When α = 0, it reduces to the SWN model with random shortcuts. The system shows the dynamic small-world (SW) effect, which is different from the well-studied static SW effect. We study the effective network diameter, the path length {{as a function of the}} <b>lattice</b> <b>distance,</b> and the dynamics. They are controlled by multiple parameters, and we use data collapse to show that the parameters are correlated. The central finding is that, in the one-dimensional network studied, the dynamic SW effect exists for 0 ≤α≤ 2. For each given value of α in this region, the point that the dynamic SW effect arises is ML^'∼ 1, where M is the number of useful shortcuts and L^' is the average reduced (effective) length of them.

40|$|Integration of {{proximity}} {{and good}} continuation cues is analyzed as a probabilistic inference problem in contour grouping. A Bayesian framework was {{tested in a}} multistable dot lattice experiment. In rectangular <b>lattices,</b> <b>distance</b> ratio and global orientation of rows and columns were manipulated. Discollinearity was introduced by imposing zigzag in one orientation, by either fixed or stochastic displacement of elements. Results indicate that proximity and good continuation are generally treated as independent sources of information, added to prior orientation log-odds to produce the odds of grouping percepts. Distance likelihood is well captured by a power law, and discollinearity likelihoods by generalized Laplace distributions, with higher kurtosis for stochastic zigzag. While observers prefer vertical over horizontal orientations, the exact prior distribution is idiosyncratic. Perceptual grouping along cardinal axes is less affected by distance, but more by discollinearity, than along oblique orientations. Results are qualitatively and quantitatively compared to ecological statistics of contours (J. H. Elder & R. M. Goldberg, 2002).

40|$|Non-local orders, {{entanglement}} entropy, and quantum fidelity are {{investigated in}} an infinite-size bond-alternating Ising chain with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction by employing the infinite matrix product state representation with the infinite time evolving block decimation method. Directly computing two distinct types of finite string correlations for very large <b>lattice</b> <b>distances,</b> {{in contrast to}} an extrapolated extreme value for finite size chains, reveals two topologically ordered phases. As the bond alternation varies, a topological quantum phase transition with continuously variable critical exponents along the phase boundary occurs between the two Haldane phases for the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction stronger than the Ising interaction, while a topological quantum crossover between them happens through an intermediate antiferromagentic phase demonstrated with the quantum fidelity for the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction weaker than the Ising interaction. The critical exponents of the order parameters and the central charges from the entanglement entropy quantify the universality classes of the phase transition points. Anisotropic Heisenberg types of spin chains with bond alternations are finally discussed to share the same criticality. Comment: 5 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
