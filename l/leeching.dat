25|$|Policy {{concerning}} the prevention and reduction of eutrophication {{can be broken}} down into four sectors: Technologies, public participation, economic instruments, and cooperation. The term technology is used loosely, referring to a more widespread use of existing methods rather than an appropriation of new technologies. As mentioned before, nonpoint sources of pollution are the primary contributors to eutrophication, and their effects can be easily minimized through common agricultural practices. Reducing the amount of pollutants that reach a watershed can be achieved through the protection of its forest cover, reducing the amount of erosion <b>leeching</b> into a watershed. Also, through the efficient, controlled use of land using sustainable agricultural practices to minimize land degradation, the amount of soil runoff and nitrogen-based fertilizers reaching a watershed can be reduced. Waste disposal technology constitutes another factor in eutrophication prevention. Because a major contributor to the nonpoint source nutrient loading of water bodies is untreated domestic sewage, it is necessary to provide treatment facilities to highly urbanized areas, particularly those in underdeveloped nations, in which treatment of domestic waste water is a scarcity. The technology to safely and efficiently reuse waste water, both from domestic and industrial sources, should be a primary concern for policy regarding eutrophication.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION:  Leeches are blood sucking parasites of the phylum Amelida {{subgroup}} Hirudinea.  Leech infestation {{is known}} as hirudiniasis. Endoparasitic infestation by <b>leech</b> is rarely reported in literature. The parasites enter the body by bathing or drinking infected water. They attach to the mucosa of the aerodigestive tract and suck blood whereby greatly increasing in size, with resultant clinical symptoms. CASE REPORT: A 52 year male presented with unilateral epistaxis and nasal obstruction. Nasal examination revealed a live <b>leech.</b> The <b>leech</b> was found lodged in the nasopharynx. The patient {{was unaware of the}} <b>leech</b> in his body. The <b>leech</b> was removed alive {{with the use of a}} nasal endoscope under local anaesthesia.   DISCUSSION : <b>Leech</b> infestation is a rare cause  of epistaxis. Absence of pain and difficult visualisation make the diagnosis difficult and delayed. There are various methods described in literature to remove <b>leeches</b> from the body. General anaesthesia may be required for its removal especially in children and when the <b>leech</b> is lodged in the tracheobronchial tree. CONCLUSION : The aim of presentation is to report a rare unusual cause of epistaxis, <b>leech</b> infestation of the nasopharynx and method of removal of the <b>leech</b> safely under local anaesthesia...|$|R
