40|$|Objectives: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to compare two mini-incision {{techniques}} and judge the impact on the quality of life, pain, and safety of living kidney donors. Patients and methods: From March through September 2003, a prospective randomized study with 60 donors had nephrectomy performed - 30 through a <b>lombotomy</b> and another 30 patients underwent subcostal mini-incisions. the same anesthetic procedure was used for both groups. All patients were evaluated from baseline (T 0) to day 90 after surgery. Pain evaluation included visual analog scale (VAS) and drug usage. To assess quality of life (QOL), the questionnaire SF- 36 was used and surgical outcomes were also checked. Results: Sixty patients (41. 6 +/- 8. 9 yr old) were included in the protocol. Regarding incision length and blood loss, no statistical difference was observed. However, irrespective to the site of the mini-incision, patients with body mass index (BMI) higher than 25 kg/m(2) had significantly longer incision length as well as higher blood loss. There were no complications. No significant difference in tramadol or in pain perception was observed between groups. QOL was also not different between groups, however, there was a significant loss with subsequent return to baseline levels. Conclusion: the position of the mini-incision (<b>lombotomy</b> or subcostal) has no significant impact on surgical outcomes, pain perception, and QOL of living kidney donors. Mini-incision techniques represent fast and safe approaches to perform nephrectomy in the healthy population. Special care must be taken in obese patients in order to minimize surgical complications.

40|$|Renal {{histology}} {{remains the}} keystone of diagnosis in most parenchymal renal diseases {{and especially in}} glomerulopathies [1 – 3]. Sampling of renal tissue by percutaneous needle biopsy was described by Iversen and Brun in 1951 [4]. This procedure is usually safe, provided contraindications are respected [5 – 10]. Such contraindications include uncontrolled hypertension and/or bleeding disorders, which can favor severe perirenal hematoma. Even when these contraindications are heeded, systematic computerized tomography (CT) showed {{that the incidence of}} perirenal hematoma discovered by CT scan (irrespective of its clinical manifestation) is 57 to 85 % [11, 12]. In the absence of contraindications, there are patients in whom the slightest possibility of a complication necessitating <b>lombotomy</b> for hemostasis would be ethically incompatible with renal biopsy. This is the case, for instance, in patients with morbid obesity or with chronic respiratory insufficiency, in whom general anesthesia might represent a considerable hazard. Finally, there are cases where the size or the anatomical location of the kidney makes renal tissue sampling difficult or impossible. Ultrasound or CT scan-guided biopsy [13 – 15] does not always obviate such pitfalls. Other, more invasive methods have been proposed to sample kidney tissue, for instance by means of a short <b>lombotomy</b> [16 – 21], but this approach, which in addition necessitates the use of an operating room and several days of hospitalization, is similarly inapplicable in a patient with severe bleeding disorder or morbid obesity. We have described a novel technique of renal biopsy using the transjugular route, inspired from that used for liver biopsy in patients with clotting disorders in whom the percutaneous route would similarly be precluded [22 – 24]. This new technique was published in abstract form [25], and we reported our preliminary results on 50 cases [26]. The goal of this Technical Note is to analyze our present experience on 200 procedures carried out in 195 patients...|$|E
