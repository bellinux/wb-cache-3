5|$|The Zelda team, however, had {{exhausted}} its {{ideas for}} this style and format. Aonuma hated the demo, finding it derivative of past Zelda games. The team explored other directions until designer Yoshiki Haruhana created a cartoonish {{drawing of a}} young Link that caught their eye. Design manager Satoru Takizawa drew up an enemy Moblin in a similar style, and the team seized on the new gameplay and combat possibilities afforded by the stylized cartoon aesthetic. To achieve this <b>look,</b> <b>they</b> used cel shading on 3D models, giving the look of an interactive cartoon. The developers built the game with Alias/Wavefront's Maya 3D tool and a custom game engine.|$|E
5|$|For the box set release, Quatermass and the Pit was {{extensively}} restored. A {{process called}} VidFIRE {{was applied to}} all of the scenes originally broadcast live, restoring the fluid interlaced video <b>look</b> <b>they</b> would have had on transmission, but which was lost during the telerecording process. For the pre-filmed scenes, most of the high-quality original 35mm film inserts still existed, as they had been spliced into the 1959–60 compilation repeat version in place of the lower-quality telerecorded versions of the same sequences. As this compilation also survived in the BBC archives, these film sequences were able to be digitally remastered and inserted into the newly restored episodic version for the DVD release. The compilation used a separate magnetic soundtrack, and although the original had decayed a safety copy had survived. This yielded better sound quality than the optical soundtracks accompanying the original episodes, and was therefore the main source for the audio remastering except in the case of scenes that were not in the compilation, and in a few cases where faults on the magnetic tracks necessitated their replacement by the optical versions.|$|E

60|$|They {{listened to}} her with adoring attention. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> genteel. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> ironed-out. <b>They</b> coughed politely, and crossed their legs with quietness, and in {{expensive}} linen handkerchiefs they blew their noses with a delicacy altogether optimistic and refined.|$|R

25|$|The fish dishes {{along with}} the meats are often {{accompanied}} by wrinkly potatoes (papas arrugadas).

25|$|Upon signing, {{they agreed}} {{that they did not}} want to follow the current trend of pop music but wanted to create an {{original}} sound that combined jazz music, jazz singing, and be-bop music. In search of a visual style for their act, they remembered the poverty of their childhood and their ability to improvise, and used their experience to assemble a collection of vintage 1940s clothes from thrift shops, that would comprise their costumes and give them the distinctive <b>look</b> <b>they</b> were searching for.|$|E
25|$|Uniforms - For {{the last}} of series one, uniform is {{investigated}} by Trinny and Susannah where the duo want to promote wearing fashionable uniforms to work. They set out to prove that uniforms can improve morale and make a workforce feel better about themselves. Trinny and Susannah both accompany their pink box around the country, {{to get a better}} idea of how the nation's uniforms <b>look.</b> <b>They</b> then descend upon the annual Somerfield supermarket manager's meeting. Trinny and Susannah then persuade the managers to let them do a re-design of the whole of supermarket's uniform.|$|E

25|$|The {{family owned}} and resided in a villa suburbana on the Caelian Hill, {{fronting}} the same street (now the Via di San Gregorio) {{as the former}} palaces of the Roman emperors on the Palatine Hill opposite. The north of the street runs into the Colosseum; the south, the Circus Maximus. In Gregory's day the ancient buildings were in ruins and were privately owned. Villas covered the area. Gregory's family also owned working estates in Sicily and around Rome. Gregory later had portraits done in fresco in their former home on the Caelian and these were described 300 years later by John the Deacon. Gordianus was tall with a long face and light eyes. He wore a beard. Silvia was tall, had a round face, blue eyes and a cheerful <b>look.</b> <b>They</b> had another son whose name and fate are unknown.|$|E
25|$|Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor and Rose reminisce {{about their}} travels {{in front of}} Mickey, who feels left out. Suddenly the TARDIS is jolted and comes to a sudden stop. The Doctor tells them they have fallen out of the time vortex and that the TARDIS's power cell is dead. The Doctor fears they are trapped in the Void, but Mickey opens the TARDIS doors {{to see that they}} are in London. Heading outside to <b>look,</b> <b>they</b> quickly realise that they are in London on a {{parallel}} Earth. The Doctor finds a small power cell in the TARDIS that still works, and he energises it with some of his own lifeforce. The cell needs time to recharge, so they decide to explore the alternate world. Rose is shocked to see a billboard with her father's picture on it, and the Doctor warns her not to seek him out because he is not her real father. Mickey decides to head off on his own and try to find his grandmother, who died in his universe. The Doctor and Rose discover that most of the population of London wear EarPod devices that feed information directly into the wearer's brain.|$|E
25|$|According to his accounts, Cooper {{realized}} that these men, who {{on a regular}} basis have seen experimental aircraft flying and landing around them as part of their job of filming those aircraft, were clearly worked up and unnerved. They explained how the saucer hovered over them, landed 50 yards away from them using three extended landing gears and then took off as they approached for a closer <b>look.</b> <b>They</b> took photographs and film. There was a special Pentagon number to call to report such incidents: called and soon was reported up the chain of command until he was instructed by a general to have the film developed, but to make no prints of it, and send it right away in a locked courier pouch. As he had not been instructed to not look at the negatives before sending them, he did. He said the quality of the photography was excellent as would be expected from the experienced photographers who took them. What he saw was exactly what they had described to him. He did not see the film before everything was sent away. He expected {{that there would be a}} follow up investigation since an aircraft of unknown origin had landed in a highly classified military installation, but nothing was ever said of the incident again. He was never able to track down what happened to those photos. He assumed that they ended up going to the Air Force's official UFO investigation, Project Blue Book, which was based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.|$|E

500|$|The {{appearance}} of the ratings icons themselves have been updated several times; originally carrying a stylized, pixelated <b>look,</b> <b>they</b> were first updated in 1999 to carry a cleaner appearance. In 2013, the rating icons were streamlined, with the textual name of the rating becoming black text on white, the [...] "content rated by" [...] tagline removed entirely, and trademark symbols moved to the bottom-right corner. The changes were intended to increase their clarity at smaller sizes (such as on mobile devices), reflecting {{the growth in the}} digital distribution of video games.|$|E
500|$|Wellard's {{name is a}} {{portmanteau}} of [...] "well hard", meaning [...] "very tough". The {{character was}} originally played by a Belgian Shepherd (Tervuren) named Zenna, who was cast {{at the age of}} one. Producers had envisioned Wellard as a [...] "rough, tough mongrel", and Zenna's owner, dog-handler Gill Raddings, explained: [...] "She had the <b>look</b> <b>they</b> wanted and the ability to do what was needed on command." [...] EastEnders producers were initially unaware that Zenna was female, and had to find a canine double to serve as temporary replacement in 1996 when it transpired that she was pregnant, going on to deliver 10 puppies. Zenna was retired in 1998, as she was [...] "losing her looks".|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the video}} the {{isolated}} and sad men depart with the doors closing on them. As the final chorus breaks into dance grooves, Madonna comes out of the theater and gives the boy a quick kiss on his lips. Both are clad in loose-fitting gray suits, which gives Madonna an androgynous <b>look.</b> <b>They</b> stroll away playfully in the sunrise, reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Jack Coogan in The Kid with the old boss pursuing them and shouting [...] "Come back, come back, we still need you" [...] in Italian. The tension between the visual and the musical dimensions of the video is extremely unsettling according to author Nicholas B. Dirks. Only when she disappears from the carousel and reappears to run away from her patriarchal boss with the young boy, then the music and visuals become comparable.|$|E

500|$|Richard H. Kline {{served as}} the film's cinematographer. Working from sketch artist Maurice Zuberano's concepts, Wise would judge {{if they were on}} the right track. Kline and Michelson would then discuss the <b>look</b> <b>they</b> wanted (along with Weldon, if effects were involved.) Each {{sequence}} was then storyboarded and left to Kline to execute. The cinematographer called his function to [...] "interpret [...] preplanning and make it indelible on film. It's a way of everybody being on the same wavelength." [...] Kline would recall that {{there was not a single}} [...] "easy" [...] shot to produce for the picture, as each scene required special consideration. The bridge, for example, was lit with a low density of light to make the console monitors display better. It was hard to frame shots so that reflections of the crew in monitors or light spilling through floor grilles were not seen in the final print.|$|E
500|$|Abrams {{chose to}} shoot the film in the {{anamorphic}} format on 35 mm film after discussions about whether the film should be shot in high-definition digital video. Cinematographer Dan Mindel and Abrams agreed the choice gave the film a big-screen feel and the realistic, organic <b>look</b> <b>they</b> wanted for the film setting. Abrams and Mindel used lens flares throughout filming to create an optimistic atmosphere and a feeling that activity was taking place off-camera, making the Star Trek universe feel more real. [...] "There's something about those flares, especially in a movie that potentially could be incredibly sterile and CG and overly controlled. There's just something incredibly unpredictable and gorgeous about them." [...] Mindel would create more flares by shining a flashlight or pointing a mirror at the camera lens, or using two cameras simultaneously and therefore two lighting set-ups. Editor Mary Jo Markey later said in interview {{that he had not}} told her (or fellow editor Maryann Brandon) this, and initially contacted the film developers asking why the film seemed overexposed.|$|E
500|$|Vicious Cycle then {{submitted}} the concept to art company Massive Black Studios to develop initial character sketches. [...] Massive Black's artists {{were allowed to}} use their imagination while developing Fred, but the one stipulation Vicious Cycle made from the beginning was Fred's head—the developers {{wanted it to be}} a liquid-filled jar with the detective's brain and eyes floating around inside. [...] Massive Black came up with several different versions of Fred, including some with guns, which lead designer Adam Cogan had already decided the game would not include. [...] After receiving the sketches, Vicious Cycle chose several that portrayed Fred with a squat, childlike appearance that retained some of the youthful focus of the scrapped Geo project. [...] The publisher, D3, decided to present all of the concept art to a test group. [...] To the developers' surprise, the test group was much more interested in a darker, more intimidating portrayal of Fred than the cartoonish, playful <b>look</b> <b>they</b> had chosen. [...] The developers decided to flesh out the concept and took the chosen sketches back to Massive Black. [...] This time the art came back darker, with similarities to Dirty Harry and The Matrix and The Evil Dead, and a Norman Rockwell-inspired look that would influence the game's art style towards a more violent theme.|$|E

500|$|Abi was {{introduced}} into the series in 2006, by executive producer Kate Harwood. The character and her casting was announced on 25 May 2006. She and her immediate family, father Max (Wood), mother Tanya (Joyner) and older sister Lauren (Duggan, recast to Jossa in 2010), are {{an extension of the}} Branning family, who have appeared in EastEnders since 1993. Fitzgerald, in her first major television role, began filming for the soap in May 2006 and made her first on-screen appearance in July. Fitzgerald's mother commented on her daughter's casting: [...] "Personally, I feel I want to show how proud we are of her and to thank everyone who has prayed for her and helped her in any way. At first, it is just the <b>look</b> <b>they</b> go for. Then it is more intensive and she had to read from a script. By the second audition, she was still up against 60 or 70 people. You start thinking about it when she gets to the third audition, but when the agent rang up and said she had got the part it was an overwhelming feeling. You don't know what it means until that point". Fitzgerald was offered the part about three months after her final audition. As Fitzgerald was only 10 years old when she got the part, she was required to balance her filming requirements with schooling in Northampton, and learning lines. In 2012, she told Inside Soap that she thought she had messed up her audition, and did not realise how big the show was until she was older. In 2014, she told BBC Radio 1 that when she met Wood and Joyner, her on-screen parents, she realised it did not matter that she had messed up her lines in her last audition, because she looked like them both. Fitzgerald was required to cry on her first day of filming, and admitted in 2014 that this was embarrassing, and she was unable to produce tears, but was [...] "just making noises". Fitzgerald was chaperoned by her mother until she was 16.|$|E
2500|$|The Law & Order episode [...] "Remand" [...] (1996), is {{loosely based}} on the Genovese case, as is the [...] episode [...] (2015). In the season 1 Law & Order episode, [...] "The Violence of Summer" [...] (1991), Detective Logan remarks: [...] "It is the post-Kitty Genovese era, nobody wants to <b>look,</b> <b>they</b> think they'll get involved", when lamenting the lack of {{witnesses}} to a rape.|$|E
2500|$|In {{yet another}} change in appearance, Shinhwa's image matured from the preppy style in Perfect Man {{to a more}} {{sophisticated}} <b>look.</b> <b>They</b> began wearing black suits, which was rather uncommon among boy bands at that time. Although they previously dyed their hair in various colors (from purple to silver), in Brand New they stopped completely, leaving their hair in either brown or black. They trimmed their hair to a neat style or cut it short, which was uncommon among boy bands because [...] "shaggy hair" [...] was in style.|$|E
