25|$|The energy {{spectrum}} of an electron {{moving in a}} periodical potential of rigid crystal lattice consists of allowed and forbidden bands and {{is known as the}} Bloch spectrum. An electron with energy inside an allowed band moves as a free electron but has an effective mass that differs from the electron mass in vacuum. However, a crystal lattice is deformable and displacements of atoms (ions) from their equilibrium positions are described in terms of phonons. Electrons interact with these displacements, and this interaction is known as electron-phonon coupling. One of possible scenarios was proposed in the seminal 1933 paper by Lev Landau, which includes the production of a <b>lattice</b> <b>defect</b> such as an F-center and a trapping of the electron by this defect. A different scenario was proposed by Solomon Pekar that envisions dressing the electron with lattice deformation (a cloud of virtual phonons). Such an electron with the accompanying deformation moves freely across the crystal, but with increased effective mass. Pekar coined for this charge carrier the term polaron.|$|E

Three <b>lattice</b> <b>defect</b> levels have been detected.

As a result of thermalization in the doped crystal the efficiency of energy transfer to Ce s+ is increased, but only at the expense of introducing a long afterglow into the Ce 8 + decay near room temperature. The temperature-dependent interactions between different centers in the lattice are adequately described by a simple kinetic model.

40|$|The quasicontinuum (QC) {{method is}} a {{multiscale}} approach {{that aims to}} reduce the computational cost of discrete lattice computations. The method incorporates smallscale local lattice phenomena (e. g. a single <b>lattice</b> <b>defect)</b> in macroscale simulations. Since the method works directly and only on the beam lattice, QC frameworks do not require the construction and calibration of an accompanying continuum model (e. g. a cosserat/micropolar description). Furthermore, no coupling procedures are required between the regions of interest in which the beam lattice is fully resolved and coarse domains in which the lattice is effectively homogenized. Hence, the method is relatively straightforward to implement and calibrate. In this contribution, four variants of the QC method are investigated for their use for planar beam lattices which can also experience out-of-plane deformation. The different frameworks are compared to the direct lattice computations for three truly multiscale test cases in which a single <b>lattice</b> <b>defect</b> is present in an otherwise perfectly regular beam lattice...|$|E
