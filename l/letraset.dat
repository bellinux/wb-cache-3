5|$|During {{the early}} and mid-20th century, print and media became a noted {{industry}} in Ashford. The Headley Brothers, a printing services company, was founded in 1881 and by the mid-1950s printed and exported over 2 million books. The <b>Letraset</b> company set up an arts material factory in Ashford in the 1960s. It closed in 2013, following the decline of <b>Letraset</b> and the company's decision to relocate works abroad.|$|E
5|$|A humanist {{sans-serif}} {{based on}} the letterforms of Jannon's type, created by Alan Meeks and published by <b>Letraset</b> and later ITC.|$|E
5|$|A logical {{extension}} of the humanist sans-serif concept is the font superfamily: a serif font and a matching humanist sans-serif with similar letterforms. Martin Majoor's FF Scala Sans is a popular example of this influenced by Gill's work, as are Charlotte Sans and Serif by Michael Gills for <b>Letraset</b> and Mr and Mrs Eaves by Zuzana Licko, {{which are based on}} Baskerville. Indeed, Monotype themselves released Joanna Sans in 2015, as a screen-optimised sans-serif font intended to complement (but not exactly match) Gill's serif design Joanna. It is intended for use at smaller sizes than Gill Sans.|$|E
50|$|The name is {{also often}} used to refer generically to sheets of dry {{transfer}} lettering of any brand. This technique was very widespread for lettering and other elements {{before the advent of}} the phototypesetting and laser computer techniques of word processing and desktop publishing. Currently, <b>Letraset's</b> line of print patterns and textures are more commonly used than its lettering.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, the {{production}} of Action Transfers was transferred to <b>Letraset's</b> Italian factory, Sodecor, where offset litho printing was used with transfers for the first time. The impetus for the move was a joint venture undertaken with Gillette to produce Action Transfers under the name Kalkitos. These were widely distributed around the world, with the brand name occasionally differing; in the US, they were known as PrestoMagiX.|$|R

Without overindulging in any of them, de Bruyn uses animation, optical illusions, time lapse, solarization, hand tinting, flash frames, refilming and flicker effects, accompanied by a dense atmosphere of word puns, dialogue, primal screams, music and even recycled and <b>letraseted</b> soundtracks...|$|R
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like <b>Letraset</b> had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E
25|$|Caslon 540 was {{a second}} American Type Founders version with {{shortened}} descenders to allow tighter linespacing. The italic was distributed by <b>Letraset</b> with a matching set of swashes. As a result, this often became sold or used without the regular or roman style of this revival.|$|E
25|$|Terry Nation {{had done}} well financially from {{commercial}} {{exploitation of the}} Doctor Who Daleks, and recognised the potential for merchandise related to Blake's 7. Nation and his agent Roger Hancock discussed this with Ray Williams of BBC Merchandising in December 1976. By May 1977, twenty-seven items of merchandise had been proposed for release by companies including Palitoy, <b>Letraset</b> and Airfix. However, only a small quantity of these was ever made available.|$|E
50|$|Unusually, URW has {{two main}} digitisations, Futura and Futura No. 2. Futura 1 has the larger range of weights with some unusual {{versions}} like stencil and shadowed designs, while Futura No. 2 has, amongst other differences, a conventional 'j' {{in all the}} non-condensed weights apart from demi-bold, but no italics except in some bold weights. According to URW, No. 2 is based on <b>Letraset's</b> version. It has also released some styles as Futura 3 and 7.|$|R
50|$|Permanent Headline’s highly compact, tightly spaced and {{industrial}} design is a prominent {{example of the}} aggressive, menacing style of graphic design that despite its poor legibility was popular in the 1960s and 70s, and was often used for purposes besides newspapers, such as book covers. It resembles other condensed designs (both typefaces and custom lettering) of the period, such as Schmalfette Grotesk (and its successor Haettenschweiler), Linotype’s Helvetica Inserat and other German designs. Similar British designs from the period include <b>Letraset’s</b> Compacta, Stephenson Blake’s Impact and Matthew Carter’s masthead for Private Eye.|$|R
25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the first Macintosh, alongside the Apple logo, Apple used a typeface called Motter Tektura, which was designed in Austria by Othmar Motter of Vorarlberger Graphik in 1975 and distributed by <b>Letraset</b> (and also famously used by Reebok). At the time, the typeface was considered new and modern. One modification to the typeface was the removal of the dot over the i. The s was also modified for the label on the Disk II 5.25-inch floppy disk drive.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} desktop {{publishing}} and CAD in the 1980s brought {{a dramatic change}} to the art supply industry. Prior to that period an art supply retail business could expect up to 65% of sales from commercial sources, which included business from advertising, engineering and architectural firms. Layouts and designs were created manually using materials such as drafting supplies and rub-on lettering (see <b>Letraset).</b> When those processes shifted onto computers, a traditional source of revenue quickly dried up and art supply businesses had to adapt.|$|E
25|$|These were {{initially}} {{drawn by hand}} on tracing paper using one sheet {{for each of the}} five colours; the various dot or line screens being added using dry transfer screens, for example Letratone manufactured by <b>Letraset</b> in the UK. The map was drawn at twice final map scale, and photographically reduced to produce the five film positives for printing. This was a simple process that required very few specialist tools. Draughting film has replaced tracing paper. This is a plastic waterproof material etched on one side so that the ink will hold.|$|E
500|$|In 1974 Kujau {{rented a}} shop {{into which he}} placed his Nazi memorabilia; the outlet also became the venue for late-night {{drinking}} sessions with friends and fellow collectors, including Wolfgang Schulze, {{who lived in the}} US and became Kujau's agent there. Kujau inflated the value of items in his shop by forging additional authentication details—for example a genuine First World War helmet, worth a few marks, became considerably more valuable after Kujau forged a note indicating that Hitler had worn it at Ypres in late October 1914. In addition to notes by Hitler, he produced documents supposedly handwritten by Bormann, Rudolf Hess, Heinrich Himmler, Hermann Göring and Joseph Goebbels. He forged passable imitations of his subjects' genuine handwriting, {{but the rest of the}} work was crude: Kujau used modern stationery such as <b>Letraset</b> to create letterheads, and he tried to make his products look suitably old by pouring tea over them. Mistakes in spelling or grammar were relatively common, particularly when he forged in English; a supposed copy of the 1938 Munich Agreement between Hitler and Neville Chamberlain read, in part: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{magazine}} proper {{began when}} Usborne learned {{of a new}} printing process, photo-litho offset, which meant that anybody with a typewriter and <b>Letraset</b> could produce a magazine. The publication was initially funded by Osmond and launched in 1961. It was named when Osmond looked for ideas in the well-known recruiting poster of Lord Kitchener (an image of Kitchener pointing with the caption [...] "Wants You") and, in particular, the pointing finger. After the name Finger was rejected, Osmond suggested Private Eye, {{in the sense of}} someone who [...] "fingers" [...] a suspect.|$|E
2500|$|Much {{has been}} made over {{the years of the}} unusual {{question}} mark suffix to the band's name. In early interviews the band said that the name was [...] "really deep" [...] and intended to raise the question [...] "do you need therapy?", but in a 1992 interview guitarist Andy Cairns admitted that it was a chance design when he was working on band's first record sleeve. Working with <b>Letraset</b> transfers, Cairns misaligned the band's name, and used the [...] "?" [...] icon to fill the space to the right. [...] "And then we thought, well maybe we can bluff our way through when people start reading into it." ...|$|E
50|$|Since 2001, Mark {{has been}} making {{drawings}} with <b>Letraset,</b> the dry transferrable lettering format. Mark makes her drawings by applying “countless dry transfer characters individually to matte board.” Mark’s abstract <b>Letraset</b> compositions “suggest an unseen source material such as aerial mapping, sewing patterns or convoluted text-based bar code”. Mark’s <b>Letraset</b> drawings {{have been used as}} source material for tattoos by a number of people. The Swedish funk/r&b band Dance Academy used one of Mark’s <b>Letraset</b> drawings for the cover of their CD Boogietime.|$|E

50|$|The {{first four}} issues of Baseline were {{published}} by TSI (Typographic Systems International Ltd.). Following TSI, issues 5-18 {{had been published}} by <b>Letraset,</b> a graphics product company, but as the magazine flourished <b>Letraset</b> faced difficult times. Mike Daines, Jenny Daines and Hans Dieter Reichert, Veronika Reichert formed Bradbourne Publishing Ltd. and bought the magazine from <b>Letraset</b> in 1994. The magazine varies in frequency but is typically published three times a year.|$|E
50|$|<b>Letraset</b> was {{a company}} known mainly for {{manufacturing}} sheets of typefaces and other artwork elements {{that can be}} transferred to artwork being prepared. <b>Letraset</b> has been acquired by the ColArt group and become part of its subsidiary Winsor & Newton.|$|E
50|$|<b>Letraset</b> saw {{a decline}} in the sales of their {{materials}} in the early 1990s so moved into the desktop publishing industry, releasing software packages for the Macintosh such as ImageStudio and ColorStudio. These never saw widespread success. However, as <b>Letraset</b> held the rights to their fonts that had been popular on the dry transfer sheets, it made sense to enter the digital font market (see, for example, Charlotte Sans). <b>Letraset</b> thus began releasing many fonts in formats such as PostScript.|$|E
50|$|MacPublisher {{was sold}} in 1986 to Esselte <b>Letraset,</b> whose {{business}} in press-down dry transfer lettering was evaporating with competition from laser printers, notably Apple's pioneering LaserWriter printer. It was briefly sold as LetraPage, but dropped from the market when <b>Letraset</b> subsequently acquired Ready,Set,Go! from Manhattan Graphics.|$|E
5000|$|In 1979 Gibbons {{was bought}} by <b>Letraset</b> for £19 million {{in an attempt to}} diversify away from their dry-lettering business, but the {{acquisition}} did not go smoothly and like Flying Flowers later, <b>Letraset</b> faced difficulties integrating Gibbons into its core business. The Chairman of <b>Letraset</b> blamed [...] "indiscriminate expansion" [...] and [...] "imprudent" [...] investment decisions for the problems at Gibbons and was quoted in The Times as saying [...] "We significantly overpaid for what we got." [...] The US$10 million paid by Gibbons for the Marc Haas collection was also questioned.|$|E

50|$|Later, in 1961, {{the process}} was much {{simplified}} and a dry transferable lettering system was developed, {{and it was this}} that made <b>Letraset</b> a household name. The range of available typefaces became extensive, incorporating both classic and contemporary type designs of the period, and each style was usually available {{in a wide range of}} type weights and sizes. <b>Letraset</b> sheets were used extensively by professional and amateur graphic designers, architects and artists in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. For the first time amateurs could produce affordable and attractive artwork of professional appearance. As a result, and because of its ease of use, it also came to be used by printers, design studios and advertising agencies. In the late 1980s <b>Letraset</b> started to be replaced by desktop publishing. Today <b>Letraset</b> sheets are traded on Ebay and elsewhere, and sometimes used so that a designer can avoid a digital look.|$|E
