5|$|Rathnavelu {{used the}} 435 Xtreme camera and also wrote a 1,600-page manual, {{in which he}} listed all of the {{possible}} angles from which the characters played by Rajinikanth could be filmed. Legacy Effects and the Hong Kong-based visual effects companies Kinomotive Studios and Menfond Electronics took responsibility for the film's CGI work. To create the robots with Rajinikanth's appearance, a complete scan of his face in 3Ddigital format in all possible lighting conditions was conducted using the Doom <b>Light</b> <b>Stage,</b> so that his face could be replicated on the mannequins. The technique, according to Shankar, was previously used in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008). The robot Chitti featured in the film was a mannequin made by a Legacy Effects team of 100technicians in Los Angeles. For every robotic mannequin used, six puppeteers were employed to control the mannequin's movements.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1998, the company's show {{installed}} {{into new}} stores, {{referred to as}} [...] "Studio C", consists of a single animated Chuck E. Cheese character created by Garner Holt alongside large television monitors, lighting effects, and interactive elements. The other characters appear as puppets on the TV screens. The control system dubbed [...] "Cyberstar" [...] was re-designed {{from the ground up}} and produced by Dave Philipsen. In some markets, the company has also tried a new store concept that omits the animated show entirely. This is the Circle of Lights stage which either consists of a live Chuck E. Cheese costume character or an animatronic in a futuristic <b>light</b> <b>stage</b> with large television monitors. In 2017, the Chuck E. Cheese announced that animatronic shows would be removed in favor of a modernized dance floor. The move is being piloted in a handful of locations prior to being implemented company-wide.|$|E
