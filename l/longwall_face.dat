40|$|In {{recent years}} uncomfortably high {{ventilation}} temperatures {{have become more}} common on <b>longwall</b> <b>faces</b> in Australian coal mines. Increasing strata temperatures at relatively shallow depths in combination with high surface ambient temperatures, particularly in Queensland, have led to high intake temperatures. These have approached trigger levels that introduce reduced face operator exposure times. With the addition of heat from coal breakage and goaf caving on high production <b>longwall</b> <b>faces</b> the working environment has become uncomfortable and continuous exposure over a shift is potentially injurious to health. Typical strata temperatures at 200 m depth are 35 ºC increasing to 38 ºC at 350 m depth. The added heat from broken coal and rock on the face and in the goaf together with heat from machinery, that has been progressively increasing in capacity, results in wet bulb temperatures exceeding 30 ºC and humidity of 95 % to 100 % on <b>longwall</b> <b>faces.</b> Management plans have introduced controls to limit continuous working times for personnel on <b>longwall</b> <b>faces</b> in the hot and humid conditions. This impacts on productivity and in some situations requires additional personnel in the panel crews. Increased ventilation quantities are a partial solution because evaporative cooling rates and reduction in effective temperatures are minimal in high humidity conditions and less effective in the already high air velocity currents on faces. High air velocities also introduce other face environment problems with dust, increased pressure differentials and goaf leakage quantities which re-enter as additional warm air back onto the face. Spontaneous combustion risks also increase in thicker seam environments. Depending on seam conditions more attractive approaches can be used such as three heading longwall development allowing a back return airway using the goaf as a partial heat sink {{and the introduction of}} direct cooling of air in the longwall panels by spray systems without disrupting the passage of employees and equipment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the conceptual model of primary rock failure mechanisms {{in the floor}} ahead of the longwall coal mining face based on underground observations and numerical modelling. During longwall mining, the stress fields and displacements of strata are constantly changing. High stress concentrations ahead of the <b>longwall</b> <b>face</b> can initiate fractures in the rock floor that can, under unfavourable stress conditions, develop into secondary floor failure, where large displacements of strata can occur. Severely broken floor strata or floor heave can seriously interfere with mining operations. Underground observations indicate that the sub-vertical shear fractures and the shear failure along the bedding planes in stratified rock {{are the most common}} fracture types observed in the rock floor below the <b>longwall</b> <b>face.</b> To explain how these fractures occur, basic principles of rock failure mechanism are applied to an overstressed rock subject to stress concentrations typically found at the <b>longwall</b> <b>face.</b> The computational simulation of the progressive longwall mining operations was undertaken in stratified rock to model complex stress distributions ahead of the <b>longwall</b> <b>face</b> and to simulate the rock failure in the mining floor.

Results of the numerical simulation show that when the width of the section pillar increases to 24 m, there is an 8 m wide elastic zone in the coal pillar and a saddle-shaped vertical stress distribution, which shows that the coal pillar can maintain its stability. So the reasonable width of the coal pillar is 24 m, which is close to the result of theoretical calculation (23 m).

40|$|During {{the last}} ten years, {{longwall}} mining systems have undergone many changes. Panel widths and lengths have increased. <b>Longwall</b> <b>faces</b> have become more automated. Average production from individual longwall panels has increased from 1, 000 to 3, 600 tons per shift. To control the dust generation resulting from the higher production, longwall dust control systems have integrated various dust control techniques. Systems designed to control dust generated at the crusherjstageloader, shearer, and supports are common to most <b>longwall</b> <b>faces.</b> A survey {{was made of the}} dust controls that are currently in place on all the longwalls in the U.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines has {{conducted}} a rock mechanics study to monitor deformation of near-seam strata above a longwall {{panel in the}} Pittsburgh Coalbed.

40|$|Longwall mining is the {{dominant}} form of underground coal mining methods in Australia. As production increases {{there is also a}} need for increased face ventilation rate for gas dilution and dust mitigation. The behaviour of gas emission and respirable dust in a <b>longwall</b> <b>face</b> is a complex process {{because of the nature of}} longwall operations. The generation, dispersion and transport of airborne dust and gas are governed mainly by the spatial velocity and the movement pattern of the ventilation air. To understand the gas and dust behaviour in a complex longwall mining environment and to evaluate the effectiveness of various dust control techniques, numerical modelling has become a necessity to supplement laboratory experiments and field studies.

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} establish a physical relationship between applied stress and permeabilities of different coals. Seven different coals, ranging from medium volatile to high volatile bituminous, were tested for stress-permeability relationship under simulated subsurface stress conditions. Prior to the experimental investigations, the stress conditions around a working <b>longwall</b> <b>face</b> were considered {{in order to achieve}} an accurate simulation of the stresses experienced underground. Laboratory stress-permeability experiments were carried out by passing nitrogen gas through a triaxially stressed cylindrical coal specimen. A slightly modified conventional triaxial testing apparatus was used for this purpose. The stress conditions employed simulated the stresses created in the front abutment zone, the crushing zone, the stress relief zone and the recompaction zone of a working <b>longwall</b> <b>face.</b> A number of specimens of the seven different coals were tested under such stress conditions and stress-permeability curves were obtained for each specimen.

40|$|AbstractFugitive dust on longwalls {{has always}} been an issue of concern for production, safety and the health of workers in the {{underground}} coal mining industry globally. Longwall personnel can be exposed to harmful dust from multiple dust generation sources. With the increase in production created from the advancement in longwall equipment, dust loads have also increased and this has resulted in an increase in exposure levels to personnel. Control processes in place for the mitigation of dust vary from mine to mine, with each individual mine having a dust mitigation setup that is only effective for that particular mine operation. While the focus in the past has quite correctly been on improving the controls on dust exposure, the future lies in identifying the efficiency of installed controls on operating longwalls, evaluating them through robust and quantitative sampling methods to ensure the most effective controls are in place to prevent occupational disease from occurring. This paper will examine the current controls for dust mitigation on longwalls and propose a new testing methodology to determine dust mitigation efficiency (DME) of installed controls for both respirable and inhalable dust. The main objective of this proposed sampling method is to identify dust loads at independent sources of dust generation in mg/tonne produced on <b>longwall</b> <b>faces</b> and quantify the efficiency of installed controls for the mitigation of produced dust on <b>longwall</b> <b>faces...</b>|$|R

Despite extensive research into the development of dust control techniques, it is still difficult to achieve Australian statutory standard of 3. 0 mg/m 3 at the face without loss of production. {{is because of the}} complex nature of longwall mining, its environment and the introduction of high capacity machines. The objective of this thesis 2 ̆ 7 research has to address this problem and advance respirable dust control in longwall mining through {{the development of a new}} dust control technique. Major aspect of the research has been to provide a better understanding of the air velocities and respirable dust behaviour, through field studies and mathematical modelling, to assist in the development of new control techniques. This research has co-ordinated several elements in developing a dust control technique and in understanding respirable dust behaviour. They are: (i) A literature review dust control on longwall faces (ii) Field investigations in longwall faces to develop fundamental data set on respirable dust distribution (iii) A new 2 ̆ 7 multi-scrubber 2 ̆ 7 to control dust levels along the walkway of the face; the design and development of compact prototype scrubber and field tests of the scrubber system in operating longwall faces, and (iv) Mathematical modelling of a <b>longwall</b> <b>face,</b> using finite element techniques to simulate air flow patterns, dust distribution and to assist in the evaluation of dust control methods; field investigations to validate the modelling results. EThe first series of field investigations in four longwall faces were conducted to data on respirable dust levels, the spatial and temporal behaviour of dust in the face, and to provide input data for mathematical modelling.
