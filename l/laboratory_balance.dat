This method is more expensive than the more common gravimetric method, given the cost of the colored reagents, and is recommended when optimal accuracy is required. It is also recommended for extremely low-volume pipette calibration, in the 2 microliter range, because the inherent uncertainties of the gravimetic method, performed with standard <b>laboratory</b> <b>balances,</b> becomes excessive. Properly calibrated microbalances, capable of reading in the range of micrograms (10−6 g) can also be used effectively for gravimetric analysis of low-volume micropipettes, but only if environmental conditions are under strict control.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the laboratory effect of Er:YAG laser on ablation rate and morphological changes in human enamel and dentin with varying water flow. Methods: 23 human third molars were sectioned in mesio-distal and buccal-lingual directions. The slabs were flattened and weighted on an analytical <b>laboratory</b> <b>balance</b> (control). A 4 -mm(2) area was demarcated and {{the samples were}} randomly assigned into three groups according to water flow employed during the laser irradiation (1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0 mL/minute). An Er:YAG laser was used to ablate enamel (80. 22 -J/cm(2), 300 mJ/ 4 Hz) and dentin (96. 26 -J/cm(2), 250 mJ/ 4 Hz). After irradiation, the samples were immersed in distilled water for 1 hour and then weighted again. The final mass was obtained and laser-irradiated substrate mass loss was calculated by {{the difference between the}} initial and final mass. Afterwards, specimens were prepared for SEM. Results: Data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey's test (P< 0. 05). It was observed that the 2. 0 mL/minute resulted in a higher mass loss, 1. 0 mL/minute showed a lower mass loss, and 1. 5 mL/minute demonstrated intermediate results (P< 0. 05). The increase of water flow promoted less melting areas and cracks. Furthermore, dentin was more ablated than enamel. It may be concluded that the water flow of Er:YAG laser and the substrates affected the ablation rate. Among the tested parameters, 2. 0 mL/minute improved the ability of ablation in enamel and dentin, with less morphologic surface alteration. (Am J Dent 20 12; 25 : 332 - 336) ...|$|E

Design: A randomised controlled trial model. Setting: Neurological Disorders, Ageing and Balance Clinic, Department of Physiotherapy, The University of Queensland. Subjects: 73 males and females over 60 years, living independently in the community and who had fallen in the previous year were recruited. Methods: All subjects received a falls risk education booklet and completed an incident calendar for the duration of the study. Treatment sessions were once a week for 10 weeks. Subject assessment before and after intervention and at 3 months follow-up included number of falls, co-morbidities, medications, community services and activity level, functional motor ability, clinical and <b>laboratory</b> <b>balance</b> measures and fear of falling. Results: All participants significantly reduced the number of falls (P < 0. 000).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} cross-sectional and longitudinal {{differences in}} static and dynamic standing balance measures and lower limb muscle strength {{in patients who}} are treated chronically with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). METHODS: Twenty-six AED exposure-discordant same-gender twin and sibling pairs were studied. Clinical and <b>laboratory</b> <b>balance</b> examinations were conducted twice, separated by at least 1 year. The mean within-pair differences in balance measures were calculated cross-sectionally at baseline and follow-up, and longitudinally. RESULTS: No significant mean within-pair difference was found at baseline in age (44 years), weight, and height (p > 0. 05). Between study assessments, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) interval was 3. 0 (2. 1 - 4. 3) years in users and 2. 9 (2. 0 - 4. 4) years in nonusers. The median duration of AED therapy was 19 (11 - 21) years. At baseline and follow-up, cross-sectional sway measures from posturography (Chattecx Balance System) and clinical static balance tests showed poorer performance in users compared to nonusers on several test conditions (p = 0. 002 - 0. 032). At follow-up, the users took longer than nonusers to complete the Four-Square-Step Test (p = 0. 005) and Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test (p = 0. 018). A greater annual rate of deterioration in sway was found in users compared to nonusers using posturography on the anteroposterior tilting platform task with distraction (p = 0. 032). In both groups, higher baseline sway predicted greater annual deterioration in sway in all platform conditions (β = 0. 3 - 0. 5, p < 0. 001 - 0. 013). The annual change in measures did not differ between groups in the clinical balance and lower limb strength assessments. SIGNIFICANCE: In this longitudinal twin and sibling study, chronic AED users had poorer standing balance compared to nonusers. Users showed greater deterioration in postural sway with one dynamic platform condition. AEDs may progressively impair balance mechanisms, although this requires further investigations. Repeated dynamic posturography could {{provide a basis for}} preventive trials for maintaining or improving balance. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
40|$|Soil Moisture Characteristic (SMC) curves {{are widely}} used in {{unsaturated}} soil mechanics and agricultural engineering. A SMC curve is {{the relation between the}} soil suction (tension in the pore water) and the water content (ratio of amount of water to solid particles, preferably by mass). Until now, the methods used to obtain the SMC have involved obtaining point measurements along the SMC curve, which can take weeks to gather, and then fitting a curve through these points. Recently at MIT, a much faster technique for obtaining a complete, continuous SMC curve has been developed. A digital <b>laboratory</b> <b>balance</b> and an MIT tensiometer, both monitored by a data acquisition computer, obtain continuous water content and soil suction data, respectively. As any other invention, advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of this device and technique need to be assessed and improved. Along the course of this research, some of these assessments or improvements were made, while attempting to extend a correlation developed recently at MIT, as well as to understand the effect of the grain size distribution on the SMC. While measurement capacity of the tensiometer was not improved, the latest version is significantly more serviceable than its predecessors. Although intended, it has not been possible to compare the tensiometer readings to theoretically induced suction values by relative humidity of the environment. Only comparative study was by capillary rise tests. Numerous parameters that affect the experiments, such as compaction and heterogeneity of the specimen, data acquisition cables, mass balance sensitivity and temperature of the environment, were discovered and their effects were minimized. The newly repeatable procedure was used to observe grain size distribution effects on the SMC curve, and to correct the past understanding of grain size-SMC relationship, which was based on biased test results for neglecting some of the affecting parameters listed above. by Nabi Kartal Toker.

40|$|Human skin has various pathologies in {{the form}} of acute and chronic diseases. Some are only {{cosmetic}} diseases which are not harmful for life but they can affect mental health and disrupt daily activities. Hyperhidrosis is one of these cosmetic diseases which may be caused by diabetes, infections, or thyroid hyper activity, or can be inherited. There are some examinations for testing hyperhidrosis, e. g. gravimetric and minor starch-iodine test. There are some devices that can measure sweat but are not specifically used or even intended for use on hyperhidrosis. A non-invasive prototype instrument called Electronic Sudometer using the principle of electrical impedance measurement has been developed. The philosophy behind this prototype is to make an instrument which can detect hyperhidrosis during homeostasis as well as in pathological condition. The device injects a sinusoid electric current and detects the ensuing voltage, which is proportional to the impedance of sweat on top of the skin during hyperhidrosis. For this prototype, the electrode system is made of brass rings mounted on a handle. The signal is then processed in electronic assembly. Processed output is transferred to a Laptop with specially made connecting wire. Computer having Sound Card Oscilloscope (Lab View based software) plots the signal and shows voltage level corresponding to sudor level. The signal output can also be displayed on a SmartPhone having software called Osciprime, requiring another specially made interface. Laboratory test results {{in the form}} of a plot of output voltage vs. impedance show accuracy of the device. The impedance results can be translated to sweat level because impedance decreases with increasing sweat during hyperhidrosis. The Sudometer was also calibrated using fixed precision resistors over its working range. Laboratory tests were carried out using an artificial skin at various sweat levels and to a yeast tissue model. Hydration of the artificial skin was quantified by weighing precision cut samples on a <b>laboratory</b> <b>balance.</b> Results from two test persons (the author and a student friend) are also included in this Master Thesis. During these experiments, the laptop computer and SmartPhone, respectively, were on internal battery to eliminate electric hazard. Any clinical device must be validated for accuracy and evaluated for safety before applying it on patients – the latter has not been done with the prototype. The author is aware of potential electrical risks, and thus the whole system was disconnected from mains 230 V during measurements on himself and a student friend. The device output seems to be well correlated to sweat level although electrolytes were not taken into account. Being a palmar hyperhidrosis patient himself, the author applied the Electronic Sudometer on his palms and the results look quite promising. At different environmental temperatures, the author checked elicited sweat responses. Patient safety is always a concern for clinicians regarding new devices. For this reason, the device itself has been made battery operated, and a new version will be entirely powered from a SmartPhone...|$|E
