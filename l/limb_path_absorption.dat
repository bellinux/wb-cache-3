40|$|The {{infrared}} limb {{spectra of}} the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) {{on board the}} Envisat satellite include detailed information on tropospheric clouds and polar stratospheric clouds (PSC). However, no consolidated cloud product is available for the scientific community. Here we describe a fast prototype processor for cloud parameter retrieval from MIPAS (MIPclouds). Retrieval of parameters such as cloud top height, temperature, and extinction are implemented, {{as well as of}} microphysical parameters, e. g. effective radius and the integrated quantities over the <b>limb</b> <b>path</b> (surface area density and volume density). MIPclouds classifies clouds as either liquid or ice cloud in the upper troposphere and polar stratospheric clouds types in the stratosphere based on statistical combinations of colour ratios and brightness temperature differences. Comparison of limb measurements of clouds with model results or cloud parameters from nadir looking instruments is often difficult due to different observation geometries. We therefore introduce a new concept, the limb-integrated surface area density path (ADP). By means of validation and radiative transfer calculations of realistic 2 -D cloud fields as input for a blind test retrieval (BTR), we demonstrate that ADP is an extremely valuable parameter for future comparison with 3 -D model data of ice water content, when applying limb integration (ray tracing) through the model fields. In addition, ADP is used for a more objective definition of a cloud detection threshold. Based on BTR, a detection threshold for ADP of 10 7 μm 2 cm− 2 and an ice water content of 10 &minus; 5 g m− 3 is estimated, depending on the horizontal and vertical extent of the cloud. Intensive validation of the cloud detection methods shows that the limb-sounding MIPAS instrument has a sensitivity in detecting stratospheric and tropospheric clouds similar to that of space- and ground-based lidars, with a tendency for higher cloud top heights and consequently higher sensitivity for some of the MIPAS detection methods. For the high cloud amount (HCA, pressure levels below 440 hPa) on global scales the sensitivity of MIPAS is significantly greater than that of passive nadir viewers. This means that the high cloud fraction will be underestimated in the ISCCP dataset compared to the amount of high clouds deduced by MIPAS. Good correspondence in seasonal variability and geographical distribution of cloud occurrence and zonal means of cloud top height is found in a detailed comparison with a climatology for subvisible cirrus clouds from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) limb sounder. Overall, validation with various sensors shows the need to consider differences in sensitivity, and especially the viewing geometries and field-of-view size, to make the datasets comparable (e. g. applying integration along the <b>limb</b> <b>path</b> through nadir cloud fields). The simulation of the <b>limb</b> <b>path</b> integration will be an important issue for comparisons with cloud-resolving global circulation or chemical transport models...|$|R

40|$|We {{establish}} {{the extent to}} which photons and dileptons are penetrating probes of hot hadronic matter by computing mean free <b>paths.</b> <b>Absorption</b> is indeed negligible for real photons as mean free paths are roughly tenths of öms. However, vector dominance effects, which provide rich structure in virtual photon mass spectra, introduce nonnegligible reabsorption and rehadronization resulting in mean free paths of the order of tens of femtometers. Consequences are illustrated by considering the net dilepton yield near the rho peak via thermal ππ annihilation from a short-lived hadronic fireball. Results suggest that disappearance of the rho in heavy-ion collisions can be due in part to reabsorption/rehadronization rather than solely due to collective effects.

40|$|A new {{off-line}} {{instrument to}} quantify peroxides in aerosol particles using iodometry in long <b>path</b> <b>absorption</b> spectroscopy {{has been developed}} and is called peroxide long <b>path</b> <b>absorption</b> photometer (Peroxide-LOPAP). The new analytical setup features important technical innovations compared to hitherto published iodometric peroxide measurements. Firstly, the extraction, chemical conversion and measurement of the aerosol samples are performed in a closed oxygen-free (~ 1 ppb) environment. Secondly, a 50 -cm optical detection cell is used for an increased photometric sensitivity. The limit of detection was 0. 1 μM peroxide in solution or 0. 25 nmol m − 3 with respect to an aerosol sample volume of 1 m 3. The test reaction was done at a constant elevated temperature of 40 °C and the reaction time was 60 min. Calibration experiments showed that the test reaction with all reactive peroxides, i. e. hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), peracids and peroxides with vicinal carbonyl groups (e. g. lauroyl peroxide) goes to completion and their sensitivity (slope of calibration curve) varies by only ± 5 %. However, very inert peroxides have a lower sensitivity. For example, tert -butyl hydroperoxide shows only 37 % sensitivity compared to H 2 O 2 after 1 h. A kinetic study revealed that even after 5 h only 85 % of this inert compound had reacted. The time trends of the peroxide content in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from the ozonolysis and photo-oxidation of α-pinene in smog chamber experiments were measured. The highest mass fraction of peroxides with 34 % (assuming a molecular weight of 300 g mol − 1) was found in freshly generated SOA from α-pinene ozonolysis. Mass fractions decreased with increasing NO levels in the photo-oxidation experiments. A decrease of the peroxide content was also observed with aging of the aerosol, indicating a decomposition of peroxides in the particles...|$|R

50|$|Atmospheric radio {{occultation}} {{relies on the}} detection {{of a change in}} a radio signal as it passes through a planet's atmosphere, i.e. as it is occulted by the atmosphere. When electromagnetic radiation (light) passes through the atmosphere, it is refracted (or bent). The magnitude of the refraction depends on the gradient of refractivity normal to the path, which in turn depends on the density gradient. The effect is most pronounced when the radiation traverses a long atmospheric <b>limb</b> <b>path.</b> At radio frequencies the amount of bending cannot be measured directly; instead the bending can be calculated using the Doppler shift of the signal given the geometry of the emitter and receiver.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} number of remote sensing satellites using the GPS radio occultation technique for atmospheric sounding, the estimation of higher order ionospheric effects and their mitigation have become relevant and important. Due to long ionospheric <b>limb</b> <b>paths,</b> GPS signals are strongly affected by ionospheric refraction during radio occultation. Standard dual-frequency GPS measurements may be used to estimate the first order term of the refractive index.

Analysing selected CHAMP-GPS occultation events different higher order ionospheric terms are estimated and their effects on dual-frequency range estimation and total electron content (TEC) estimation are discussed. We have found that the separation between the GPS L 1 and L 2 ray paths exceeds the kilometer level during occultation for a vertical TEC level of more than 160 TEC units.
