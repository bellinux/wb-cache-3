5|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, {{judgments}} handed down by the courts are considered a source of law. Judgments may interpret statutes or subsidiary <b>legislation,</b> <b>or</b> develop principles of common law and equity laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes.|$|E
5|$|In {{a number}} of countries, mainly in Asia, <b>legislation</b> <b>or</b> {{corporate}} practice has introduced formal menstrual leave to provide women with either paid or unpaid {{leave of absence from}} their employment while they are menstruating. Countries with policies include Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea. The practice is controversial due to concerns that it bolsters the perception of women as weak, inefficient workers, as well as concerns that it is unfair to men.|$|E

5|$|No {{subsidiary}} legislation made under an Act of Parliament may be {{inconsistent with the}} provisions of any Act.

5|$|Professional divers may be {{required}} by <b>legislation</b> <b>or</b> industry codes of practice to carry sufficient reserve gas {{to enable them to}} reach a place of safety, such as the surface, or a diving bell, based on the planned dive profile. This reserve gas is usually required to be carried as an independent emergency gas supply (EGS), also known as a bailout cylinder, set or bottle. This usually also applies to professional divers using surface-supplied diving equipment.|$|E
5|$|Violence {{against women}} may take many forms, {{including}} physical, sexual, emotional and psychological and may occur throughout the life-course. Structural violence may be embedded in <b>legislation</b> <b>or</b> policy, or be systematic misogyny by organisations against groups of women. Perpetrators of personal violence include state actors, strangers, acquaintances, relatives and intimate partners and manifests itself across a spectrum from discrimination, through harassment, sexual assault and rape, and physical harm to murder (femicide). It may also include cultural {{practices such as}} female genital cutting.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature {{there is no need for}} contracts, <b>legislation,</b> <b>or</b> acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.|$|E
