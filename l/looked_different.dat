25|$|Katarina {{first met}} the Seventh Doctor {{when she was}} a little girl. As the Doctors <b>looked</b> <b>different,</b> she was unaware that they were the same person. She spoke to him of her {{ambition}} to serve as a handmaid to a priestess because her poor family could not afford to feed her any longer. The Doctor gave her family a gold coin, which would feed them for a year. However, on learning Katarina's name, the Doctor realized that she would die young as he has already witnessed it in his personal timeline.|$|E
25|$|The St. Pauli {{quarter was}} well known as being an area where prostitutes were to be found, and was {{dangerous}} for anyone that <b>looked</b> <b>different</b> than the usual clientele. The stage of the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood balanced {{on the top of}} beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to who {{would be the first to}} break it. After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano, it finally broke. Storm's guitarist, Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne, remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around Storm. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen with coshes, who beat the musicians as punishment. Horst Fascher was Koschmider's nightclub bouncer, whose career as a boxer had been cut short (he had unintentionally killed a sailor in a street fight) although he later became a friend of The Beatles, and protected them.|$|E

500|$|Thayer then {{returned}} to his business in 1847. Ives needed another print run of The Mansion Of Happiness that year. So Thayer needed two new litho stones, resulting in the fourth edition. Thayer again printed one color in black and one color in green and changed the endspace back to a green octagon. The entire game board <b>looked</b> <b>different</b> from his first two print runs. Thayer's first and second edition litho stones were either no longer usable or ground down and redrawn for other lithographs.

500|$|Other {{significant}} obstacles for {{law enforcement}} were Bundy's generic, essentially anonymous physical features, and a curious chameleon-like ability to change his appearance almost at will. Early on, police complained of the futility of showing his photograph to witnesses; he <b>looked</b> <b>different</b> in virtually every photo ever taken of him. In person, [...] "his expression would so change his whole appearance that there were moments that you weren't even sure {{you were looking at}} the same person", said Stewart Hanson, Jr., the judge in the DaRonch trial. [...] "He [...] really a changeling." [...] Bundy was well aware of this unusual quality and he exploited it, using subtle modifications of facial hair or hairstyle to significantly alter his appearance as necessary. He concealed his one distinctive identifying mark, a dark mole on his neck, with turtleneck shirts and sweaters. Even his Volkswagen Beetle proved difficult to pin down; its color was variously described by witnesses as metallic or non-metallic, tan or bronze, light brown or dark brown.|$|E

500|$|In 1796, {{the plain}} {{on both sides}} of the river, some [...] wide, was dotted with villages and farms. At both far edges of the flood plain, {{especially}} on the eastern side, the old mountains created dark shadows on the horizon. Tributaries cut through the hilly terrain of the Black Forest, creating deep defiles in the mountains. The tributaries meandered in rivulets through the flood plain to the river.

In 1790, though, the river was wild and unpredictable, in some places four or more times wider than in the twenty-first century, even under regular (non-flood stage) conditions. Its channels wound through marsh and meadow, and created islands of trees and vegetation that were periodically submerged during floods. It was crossable at Kehl, by Strasbourg, and Hüningen, by Basel, where systems of viaducts and causeways made access reliable.|$|E
500|$|The St. Pauli {{quarter of}} Hamburg, where the Indra club was located, {{was well known}} as an area where prostitutes were to be found, and was a {{dangerous}} place for anyone that <b>looked</b> <b>different</b> from the usual clientele. McCartney's father, Jim McCartney, was reluctant to let his teenage son go to Hamburg, but relented after a visit from Williams, who {{told him that he}} [...] "shouldn't worry". Lennon's aunt, Mimi Smith, was also reluctant to allow Lennon to go to Hamburg, wanting Lennon to continue his studies, but Lennon placated her by exaggerating the amount he would earn. Best had an audition in Williams' Jacaranda club on 15 August 1960, and travelled to Hamburg the next day {{as a member of the}} group. Williams later admitted that the audition with Best was not needed, as they had not found any other drummer willing to travel to Hamburg, but did not tell Best in case he asked for more money. The group were to be paid about £100 per week, which was much more than promoters in Liverpool paid. Williams drove the group and their equipment in his Austin J4 minibus which was loaded by crane onto a ferry at Harwich on 16 August 1960, and landed at the Hook of Holland.|$|E
500|$|The host {{performed}} each {{episode in}} front of a [...] "blue screen", with animation added later. The show's digital design department combined high-tech and low-tech methods by creating and photographing three-dimensional objects, then cutting them out and placing them into the background. This made the objects look more real and added perspective and depth. Their animation technique was at that time a new technology. Johnson hired artist Dave Palmer and production company Big Pink to create the animation from simple materials like fabric, paper, or pipe-cleaners, and scan them into a Macintosh computer so that they could be animated using inexpensive computer software such as Media 100, Ultimatte, Photoshop and After Effects, instead of being repeatedly redrawn as in traditional animation. The result was something that <b>looked</b> <b>different</b> from anything else on television at the time, and the producers were able to animate two episodes in eight weeks, as compared to the sixteen weeks necessary to create a single episode by traditional methods. Their process looked like traditional cut-out animation, but was faster, more flexible, and less expensive, and it allowed them to make changes based on feedback from test audiences. Unlike traditional animation environments, which tended to be highly structured, the animators were given information about the characters and goals of the scenes they would animate, and then given the freedom to work out the timing and look of each scene themselves, as long as their creations were true to the characters and to the story. By 1999, the show's animation department consisted of Palmer, 20 animators, 11 digital designers, and 5 art directors and model makers. By 2002, Nickelodeon had built a [...] "state-of-the-art" [...] $6 million digital animation studio that housed 140 people, including 70 animators.|$|E

Between 1927 and 1975, the construction of a canal allowed the control of the water level.

2500|$|Del Toro met concept artists John Howe and Alan Lee, Weta Workshop head Richard Taylor, and {{make-up artist}} Gino Acevedo {{in order to}} keep {{continuity}} with the previous films, and he also hired comic book artists to complement Howe's and Lee's style on the trilogy, including Mike Mignola and Wayne Barlowe, who began work around April 2009. He has also considered looking at Tolkien's drawings and using elements of those not used in the trilogy. As Tolkien did not originally intend for the magic ring Bilbo finds to be the all-powerful talisman of evil it is revealed to be in The Lord of the Rings, delToro said he would address its different nature in the story, but not so much as to draw away from the story's spirit. Each Dwarf would need to look different from the others. DelToro would have redesigned the Goblins and Wargs and the Mirkwood spiders would also have <b>looked</b> <b>different</b> from Shelob. DelToro felt the Wargs had to be changed because [...] "the classical incarnation of the demonic wolf in Nordic mythology is not a hyena-shaped creature".|$|E

In 1790, though, the river was wild and unpredictable, in some places more than four or more times wider than the twenty-first century, even under regular (non-flood) conditions. Its channels wound through marsh and meadow and created islands of trees and vegetation that were periodically submerged by floods.

2500|$|For the 1973 model year, Chargers {{received}} new {{sheet metal}} (though {{at first glance}} only the rear roof [...] "C-Pillars" [...] <b>looked</b> <b>different)</b> and were in fact longer, wider, and slightly taller than the 1971-72 cars. Also new were vertically slatted taillights and new grilles. Hidden headlights were dropped, even as an option. The 318 was still standard, with the 340 (available only on the Rallye), 360 (2-barrel only), 400 (low power 2-barrel/single exhaust and high performance 4-barrel/dual exhaust) and 440 remaining as options. The SE models had a new roof treatment that had a [...] "triple opera window" [...] surrounded by a canopy-style vinyl roof.

Total sales this year were around 108,000 units, the highest ever for the 1971-74 Charger generation, though more than 60 percent of the cars had the non-high performance engines. The 1973 Chargers, and all Chrysler products, were equipped with 5mph bumpers, front and rear.|$|E
2500|$|Davis {{learned to}} dance {{from his father}} and his [...] "uncle" [...] Will Mastin. Davis joined the act as a child and they became the Will Mastin Trio. Throughout his career, Davis {{included}} the Will Mastin Trio in his billing. Mastin and his father shielded him from racism, such as by explaining race-based snubs as jealousy. However, when Davis served in the United States Army during World War II, he was confronted by strong prejudice. He later said: [...] "Overnight the world <b>looked</b> <b>different.</b> It wasn't one color any more. I could see the protection I'd gotten all my life from my father and Will. I appreciated their loving hope that I'd never need to know about prejudice and hate, but they were wrong. It was as if I'd walked through a swinging door for 18 years, a door which they had always secretly held open." [...] At age 7 Davis played the title role in the film Rufus Jones for President, in which he sang and danced with Ethel Waters. He lived for several years in Boston's South End, and reminisced years later about [...] "hoofing and singing" [...] at Izzy Ort's Bar & Grille.|$|E
