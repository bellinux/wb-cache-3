2500|$|Towards the center, {{at the end}} of the groove, {{there is}} another wide-pitched section known as the lead-out. At the very end of this section the groove joins itself to form a {{complete}} circle, called the lock groove; when the stylus reaches this point, it circles repeatedly until lifted from the record. On some recordings (for example Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles, Super Trouper by ABBA and Atom Heart Mother by Pink Floyd), the sound continues on the <b>lock</b> <b>groove,</b> which gives a strange repeating effect. Automatic turntables rely on the position or angular velocity of the arm, as it reaches the wider spacing in the groove, to trigger a mechanism that lifts the arm off the record. [...] Precisely because of this mechanism, most automatic turntables are incapable of playing any audio in the <b>lock</b> <b>groove,</b> since they will lift the arm before it reaches that groove.|$|E
50|$|Note: Each track {{ends in a}} <b>lock</b> <b>groove,</b> {{the tracks}} on side two are {{separated}} by wide bands etched with {{the title of the}} previous track.|$|E
5000|$|On the {{original}} vinyl release, after the record needle pans across the run-out groove to the <b>lock</b> <b>groove,</b> {{there is a}} recording of Harper saying [...] "Hup hup" [...] over and over again. Some subsequent CD releases have included this recording as a separate track, [...] "Hup Hup Spiral".|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a live album with a <b>locked</b> <b>groove</b> is Eagles Live: The applause {{at the end of}} side 4 would {{continue}} into the <b>locked</b> <b>groove,</b> rather than fading out like on the other sides.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} many techno records {{featuring}} loops as recorded <b>locked</b> <b>grooves,</b> which will continuously repeat the beats and musical phrases, which {{can then be}} utilized by a DJ. Warp20, the 20th anniversary box set from Warp Records, features two 10-inch <b>locked</b> <b>groove</b> albums, each containing 20 looped tracks from the record label's most popular artists. Both album sleeves contain correct turntable pitch speed settings for each track. Another example is Luke Slater's [...] "Diesel Drudge," [...] from his 1994 EP Planetary Funk Vol 4, which also ends in a <b>locked</b> <b>groove.</b> Speedy J's 2002 album Loudboxer was released on CD with 15 songs segued together, but the double LP version consists of 200 <b>locked</b> <b>grooves,</b> {{each with its own}} four-letter title.|$|R

50|$|A {{cardboard}} {{record was}} {{a type of}} cheaply made phonograph record made of plastic-coated thin paperboard. These discs were usually small, had poor audio quality compared to vinyl or acetate discs, and were often only marginally playable due to their light weight, slick surface, and tendency to warp like a taco shell. Playability could be improved by placing a coin between the <b>lock</b> <b>groove</b> and the spindle hole to add weight and stability. These records are distinct from both flexi discs, which are sturdier, and {{from many of the}} old home-recording discs since cardboard discs were mass-produced for a specific purpose.|$|E
5000|$|Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements is {{the second}} album by British group Stereolab, {{originally}} released in August 1993. The majority of the first 1500 vinyl copies had to be destroyed because of bad pressing quality. The third track [...] "Pack Yr Romantic Mind" [...] had to be re-recorded because it used a George Harrison sample which the band was unable to receive permission to use. The {{end of the last}} track, [...] "Lock-Groove Lullaby", extends into a <b>lock</b> <b>groove</b> repeating a phrase sampled from Perrey and Kingsley's [...] "The Savers" [...] on their album Kaleidoscopic Vibrations: Spotlight on the Moog.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the best-known}} {{examples}} of this technique was The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). Many UK copies featured a multi-layered collage of randomized chatter in their run-off loops. However, two variations were made: the original British pressing (black label with gold logo) has the [...] "inner groove" [...] play through the entire <b>locked</b> <b>groove</b> and {{does not include the}} laughter {{at the beginning of the}} piece. The re-issue of the British pressing (black label with silver logo) starts playing the [...] "inner groove" [...] long before the needle reaches the <b>locked</b> <b>groove,</b> includes the laughter and, once the needle hits the <b>locked</b> <b>groove,</b> the listener only hears the last two seconds of the piece played over and over again. The Who responded by putting a musical <b>locked</b> <b>groove</b> at the end of their 1967 album The Who Sell Out.|$|R

50|$|Most {{records have}} a <b>locked</b> <b>groove</b> {{at the end}} of each side or {{individual}} band. It is usually a silent loop which keeps the needle and tonearm from drifting into the label area. However, it is possible to record sound in this groove, and some artists have included looping audio in the <b>locked</b> <b>groove.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} released by SST Records on <b>lock</b> <b>groove</b> vinyl, which allowed the listener {{to listen to}} the remaining few seconds of each composition {{for as long as they}} desired. On the original vinyl recording, Ranaldo created a few of the tracks directly in the mastering studio where the cutting of the original vinyl version took place. In addition to the locked grooves, the LP was mastered at 45 RPM (although the vinyl's record label also gave a [...] "varispeed" [...] designation, suggesting that the record could be enjoyed at any speed) and also contained on the album's second side an engraving of the serpent designed by Savage Pencil, which was given its own track number, title, and facetious [...] "infinity" [...] track length.|$|E
5000|$|We Hate You South African Bastards! was {{the second}} album from the Irish band Microdisney. It was re-issued on CD with the title Love Your Enemies to reflect post-Apartheid South Africa. The album {{consists}} of early recordings of Microsdisney before they moved from Cork to London. Tracks 7 and 1 were the respective A- and B-sides of their first 7" [...] single (Kabuki, # kamd2, 1982). Tracks 5 and 4 were the respective A- and B-sides of their second 7" [...] single (Kabuki, # kamd4, 1983). Tracks 9-11 appear only on the CD re-issue and were originally released as the 12" [...] EP In This World (Rough Trade, # RTT175, 1985). The rest were all previously unreleased songs. Track 8 ended in a <b>lock</b> <b>groove</b> on the original vinyl release.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{example of}} {{recorded}} locked groove record is Godspeed You! Black Emperor's debut album F#A#∞ (pronounced F-sharp, A-sharp, Infinity). At {{the end of}} the song [...] "Bleak, Uncertain, Beautiful ..." [...] there is a string phrase recorded on the locked groove. The title's [...] "infinity" [...] refers to this phrase. The Stereolab album Transient Random Noise Bursts With Announcements ends with the song [...] "Lock Groove Lullaby" [...] which, as the name suggests, extends into the locked groove. Nail by Scraping Foetus Off The Wheel (1985) features a recorded <b>lock</b> <b>groove</b> on the final song ("Anything") which results in the final note of the album slowly repeating itself. Portugal. The Man's 2008 album Censored Colors contains a locked groove at {{the end of the}} first disc repeating the words [...] "turn me over." [...] The second side of the live King Crimson album, USA has a locked groove that contains the first few seconds of applause after they finish playing [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man." [...] The first Kissing the Pink album, Naked, features a recorded locked groove at the end of side one which continuously plays the last note of [...] "The Last Film." [...] The Otto Von Schirach album Pukology is pressed on two 7-inch colored discs (one yellow, one transparent brown), all four sides end in recorded locked grooves. One side ends with repeated burping, one side ends with repeated toilet flushing, one side ends with what sounds like tape/record scratching, and one side ends with repeated vomiting.|$|E
50|$|Original vinyl {{copies of}} Sell Out end with an audio oddity that repeats into a <b>locked</b> <b>groove</b> (In {{response}} to The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band).

50|$|An anti-record is {{a musical}} vinyl record {{which has been}} treated (melted, drilled, painted, etc.) so that it becomes a noise record. While this term was first used by Laylah Records on {{conventional}} vinyl releases by Current 93, Nurse With Wound and others, Ron Lessard of RRRecords applied the term {{to a series of}} physically altered records released by RRR in 1988. Anti-records can also be records featuring strange configurations or pressing, such as extra or unusually sized holes, <b>locked</b> <b>grooves,</b> and parallel grooves. One notable noise anti-record was Pagan Muzak, created by noise artist Boyd Rice, which contained <b>locked</b> <b>grooves</b> as well as multiple center holes. RRRecords also published a record containing 500 <b>locked</b> <b>grooves</b> by various artists.|$|R
5000|$|Vinyl {{records are}} easily {{scratched}} and vinyl readily acquires a static charge, attracting dust {{that is difficult}} to remove completely. Dust and scratches cause audio clicks and pops and, in extreme cases, they can cause the needle (stylus) to skip over a series of grooves, or worse yet, cause the needle to skip backwards, creating an unintentional <b>locked</b> <b>groove</b> that repeats the same 1.8 seconds (at 33⅓ RPM) or 1.3 seconds (at 45 RPM) of track over and over again. <b>Locked</b> <b>grooves</b> are not uncommon and are even heard occasionally in broadcasts. The <b>locked</b> <b>groove</b> gave rise to the expression [...] "broken record" [...] referring to someone who continually repeats the same statement with little if any variation.|$|R
