25|$|In 207 BCE, Xiang Yu's army {{advanced}} towards Julu {{and he sent}} Ying Bu and Zhongli Mo to {{lead the}} 20,000 strong vanguard army to cross the river and attack the Qin forces led by Zhang Han, while he followed behind with the remaining majority of the troops. After crossing the river, Xiang Yu ordered his men to sink their boats and destroy all but three days worth of rations, in order to force his men to choose between prevailing against overwhelming odds within three days or die trapped before {{the walls of the}} city with no supplies or any hope of escape. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Chu forces scored a great victory after nine engagements, defeating the 300,000 strong Qin army. After the battle, other rebel forces, including those not from Chu, came to join Xiang Yu out of admiration for his martial valour. When Xiang Yu received them at the gate, the rebel chiefs were so fearful of him that they sank to their knees and did not even dare to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Dane {{leaned forward}} a little, and {{forced her to}} <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{flashed a}} {{grateful}} <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{and saw that}} he knew her secret.|$|E
60|$|Gudrun <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> white, childlike, mute with trouble.|$|R
60|$|LINA. [writing] T-a-r-l-e-t-o-n. Er--? [She <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> inquiringly].|$|R
60|$|Her eyebrows were faintly contracted. She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> pathetically.|$|R
60|$|Accustomed to {{his voice}} and his caressing hand, the {{astonished}} creatures seemed to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in surprise.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she felt}} the man's hand on her shoulder, {{and that he was}} {{compelling}} her to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Though {{she did not}} <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> she started. There was a {{difference}} between the proposition and the covenant, which she had felt only too quickly.|$|E
60|$|Hesitating, {{she touched}} the towel, then <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> anxiously.|$|R
60|$|Gudrun <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a luminous, roguish, unknown face.|$|R
60|$|Wingate laughed softly. She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with {{twinkling}} eyes.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the last}} {{sounds of the}} {{voluntary}} had died away, and the congregation had gone, she ventured again to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and say, 'I am so glad!' ...|$|E
6000|$|VALENTINE (pausing, {{with his}} hand on the lever, to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and say). What do you bet that I don't get that tooth out without your feeling it? ...|$|E
60|$|So {{the magician}} again waved his paw and chuckled and gurgled and blinked, until Twinkle {{suddenly}} found {{she had to}} <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as he squatted on his mound.|$|E
60|$|He obeyed mutely. She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with bright, unquailing eyes.|$|R
60|$|And she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> half smiling, half pouting; {{altogether}} bewitching.|$|R
60|$|She {{closed the}} book and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with {{twinkling}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|Blakeney paid no heed {{seemingly}} to the other's hesitation. He did {{not even}} <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> but quietly drew pen and paper towards him, and made ready to write.|$|E
6000|$|Olga, lying {{faint and}} {{bleeding}} on the hearth rug, was just able to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> imploringly and utter {{in a sharp}} cry of alarm the one word [...] "Niaz." ...|$|E
60|$|Alton {{seemed to}} shiver, {{but his eyes}} were fixed on her steadily, and next moment he had laid his hand upon her {{shoulder}} and forced her to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} brooding. She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{suddenly}} in surprise.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{with her}} grey eyes, humiliated and lonely.|$|R
60|$|Meriem <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in surprise. The Hon. Morison grinned sheepishly.|$|R
6000|$|She seemed {{still to}} <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> but now more serenely. [...] "I made out you were sure--and that helped it to come. So you see," [...] she continued, [...] "we do get on." ...|$|E
60|$|Percy strode up {{and down}} the room. Once or twice he stopped before me, as if he would speak, but he did not. I was crying freely now, and I could not <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|June saw Irene <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{through her}} screen of blossoms. It {{was not the}} look of a coquette, but--far worse to the {{watching}} girl--of a woman fearful lest that look should say too much.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Emma <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> horrified. All her {{firmness}} {{was gone}} now.|$|R
60|$|She ceased bathing his arm, and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{suddenly}} quite pale.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> almost for {{the first}} time since her entrance.|$|R
6000|$|Bartley was {{addressing}} for {{the mail}} the papers {{which one of}} the girls was folding. [...] "What {{are you going to do}} about it?" [...] he demanded of his sympathizer with whimsical sullenness, not troubling himself to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|It stung {{him into}} venturing further {{than he had}} ever gone with her before. Not too gently, he took her head in both his hands and forced her to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> She {{submitted}} without a protest. She was disdainful, but helpless.|$|E
60|$|The {{smile with}} which she {{answered}} him was so provocative, attested so easy a virtue, that Mr. Hutton took fright. He {{was on the brink}} once more--on the brink. He must draw back, oh! quickly, quickly, before it was too late. The girl continued to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> shyly, {{yet with}} unmistakable love transfiguring her countenance.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with {{a little}} grimace and patted his hand.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with an {{expression}} of pleading in her eyes.|$|R
