5|$|Bhairava {{then takes}} Mithra, his soldiers, and his caretakers to the Bhairavakona temple atop a cliff to seek blessings from God. Mithra demands Bhairava admit {{his love for}} her. When he does not respond, she upsets the sacred items they have brought for the puja and, using her own blood, paints an image on a nearby rock of Bhairava leaving his true <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his duty. An injured soldier arrives to tell Bhairava that Ranadev and Sher Khan's army have killed Vikram Singh and are now rushing toward them. They arrive shortly, and Sher Khan {{challenges}} Bhairava to battle his soldiers. Bhairava boldly accepts the challenge and kills a hundred soldiers, but is severely injured in the process. Sher Khan, impressed by Bhairava's bravery, has a change of heart. However, Ranadev continues attacking, eventually wounding Mithra fatally, but he is in turn killed by Bhairava. A dying Mithra asks Bhairava to confess his love, but before he can respond, she dies and falls off the cliff. Distraught, he follows her and falls to his own death.|$|E

500|$|Satire {{and comedy}} {{are a major}} aspect of Tenacious D's lyrical content. Gass said of their approach: [...] "I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the {{straight}} music thing, but that's kind of against our mission, which is to rebel against the serious singer-songwriter mentality." [...] Their songs evoke heavy metal clichés of bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. In particular, the song [...] "Dio" [...] pokes fun {{at the idea of}} a torch being passed. Songs like [...] "Friendship" [...] parody the lack of real friendship, as well as point out the [...] traits in rock groups with the lyric [...] "As long as there's a record deal, we'll always be friends". Tenacious D also employs the technique of deliberate backmasking on [...] "Karate", a technique employed by other metal bands like Slayer, who recorded a message in Hell Awaits.|$|E
500|$|Since no new Futurama {{projects}} were in production, the movie Into the Wild Green Yonder {{was designed to}} stand as the Futurama series finale. However, Groening had {{expressed a desire to}} continue the Futurama franchise in some form, including as a theatrical film. In an interview with CNN, Groening said that [...] "we have a great relationship with Comedy Central and we would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more episodes for them, but I don't know... We're having discussions and there is some enthusiasm but I can't tell if it's just me". Comedy Central commissioned an additional 26 new episodes, and began airing them in 2010.

500|$|In 2005, Constantine was released, {{a feature}} film that {{did not use the}} same title as the comic book, in order to avoid {{confusion}} with the Hellraiser horror franchise. The only links to the character of John Constantine were the name and a plotline loosely based on the [...] "Dangerous Habits" [...] story arc (Hellblazer #41–46). DC Comics announced a sequel to the 2005 Constantine movie was in the works, with producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura linked to the project. He stated: [...] "I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it...We want to do a hard, R-rated version of it. We're going to scale back the size of the movie to try and persuade the studio to go ahead and make a tough version of it."

500|$|Because of her tour of North Vietnam {{during wartime}} and the {{subsequent}} rumors circulated about her visit, resentment against her among some veterans and currently serving U.S. military still exists. For example, when U.S. Naval Academy cadets, {{who had not yet}} been born when Fonda protested against the Vietnam war, shouted out [...] "Goodnight, Jane Fonda!", the company replied [...] "Goodnight, bitch!" [...] This practice has since been prohibited by the academy's Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures. In 2005, Michael A. Smith, a U.S. Navy veteran, was arrested for disorderly conduct in Kansas City, Missouri, after he spat chewing tobacco in Fonda's face during a book-signing event for her autobiography, My Life So Far. He told reporters that he [...] "consider it a debt of honor", adding [...] "she spit in our faces for 37 years. It was absolutely worth it.

500|$|Prior to Carey signing {{her record}} deal with Columbia, she and Margulies had written and {{produced}} fourteen songs {{over a three-year}} period, seven of which made the final track listing of her self-titled debut studio album (1990), including [...] "Someday".

Carey explained the process behind the song's conception, saying that Margulies would play different notes on an electric keyboard with Carey directing him on chord changes, and provided the lyrics, chorus and melody. Producer Ric Wake later recalled that [...] "Someday" [...] was his favorite song from the beginning of recording sessions for the album, saying [...] "I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it {{if you want to do}} it.'

500|$|Dave McKean drew {{most of the}} {{principal}} art, {{as well as the}} cover art of the graphic novel. In illustrating the story, McKean blends paintings, drawings, photography, and mixed-media collage to come up with striking page designs, and dense symbols. He has said that he was [...] "trying to make the book despite the subject, rather than because of it. At the end of the day, if you really <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> Batman comics, then that's probably the best thing to do. Not liking them, and then trying to make something out of them is just a waste of time." [...] He also came to think that [...] "overpainted, lavish illustrations in every panel just didn't work. It hampers the storytelling." [...] McKean liberally uses symbolism, imagery, and surrealism, and many scenes involve the use of symbols to denote a particular psychological device. For example, a Greek inscription can be seen scratched on the doorway of Maxie Zeus's electroshock chamber, which translates into [...] "Discover thyself." [...] Much of this symbolism was later explained and expanded upon by the release of the 15th Anniversary Edition containing Morrison's annotated script.|$|E
500|$|The film {{features}} a musical score by Aaron Zigman, {{who was hired}} after Alison Krauss {{backed out of the}} job. Zigman mentioned that there are similarities between the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia and the film Flicka in that [...] "...at times there's a bit of a Celtic influence but not much", but he also {{went on to say that}} there was a more modern feel to the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia. He did so as Csupó requested him to do not compose [...] "your typical Hollywood Score"; he then mixed up orchestral melody with [...] "a bit of a modern flavor." [...] The score he composed for the film is described as [...] "very large" [...] compared to his other work, and Zigman commented that [...] "Aside from the minimalist stuff and coloring that I <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> I also like big orchestral stuff, and want to do more of that, and this film enabled me to spread my wings out a bit." [...] The official soundtrack for the film was released as Music from and Inspired by Bridge to Terabithia by Hollywood Records on February 13, 2007.|$|E
