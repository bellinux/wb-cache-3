The ‘cultivated ’ {{nature of}} the Chinese science parks, against the {{background}} of a transitional economy, differentiates them from spontaneous and cooperative Western models, and is a phenomenon deserving close examination. We study the dynamics and features of the so-called Optics Valley of China (OVC) in Hubei, aiming to explore the characteristics of an embryonic local innovation system constructed in a <b>less-favoured</b> <b>region.</b> The results show that institutional factors are the leading forces in a cultivated science park like the OVC. However, along with the shifting focus of the local government, the OVC’s industrial scale has remained small and its industrial chain has remained incomplete. Moreover, the lack of trust and interactions between various components in this innovation system has been highly noticeable. All these features may be seen as warnings to the OVC that a revision of this innovation system is needed {{in order to avoid the}} fate of becoming an ‘optical illusion’...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. British regional policy has emphasised 'locally-bounded' innovation processes dependent upon regional knowledge bases, downplaying {{the role of}} global inter-linkages and inter-dependencies. Consequently, regional policy tends to {{stress the importance of}} endogenous capacity through the promotion of regional specialisation and competitiveness by constituting the region as the site of innovation drawing on the social, institutional and knowledge assets that are spatially embedded in particular places. These regions are seen as simultaneously competing in the global economy, although the focus on the concentration of innovation processes obscures the distribution of knowledge across regions and countries in the globalising, knowledge economy. This research project is designed to address these issues by using global commodity chain and global production network approaches to explore the life sciences industry in a <b>less-favoured</b> <b>region</b> (Scotland) where the policy emphasis on local capabilities and capacities raises a number of concerns. In particular, it will consider how innovation processes and knowledge operate across different locations and especially how they are both concentrated and dispersed throughout the commodity chain. Thus it will question why certain places are less 'successful' at attracting and embedding such processes than others, especially less-favoured regions suffering from the effects of industrial restructuring and uneven development...|$|E

40|$|As an {{increasing}} amount of manufacturing employment has relocated to the Global South, the developed {{economies of the}} Global North have sought new ways of competing within the global economy. In part {{they have done so}} through the promotion of the so-called ‘knowledge-based economy’ (KBE) constituted by innovations and new markets in high-tech industries like telecommunication, information technology, and the life sciences. A KBE discourse has become a central plank of policy at the national and European levels. This raises a series of questions, however, about the ability of <b>less-favoured</b> <b>regions</b> to compete for knowledge-based activities, given existing conditions of uneven development and the unequal distribution of knowledge assets between regions in the developed economies. In this respect, particularly critical to regional outcomes are the forms of economic coordination and governance that emerge in knowledge-based commodity chains. Engaging with recent debates concerned with global commodity chains, this paper builds on the idea that economic governance is increasingly alliance driven, entailing a diverse set of geographies and trust-based relationships between a variety of organisations that include small innovative firms, large multinational corporations, and national (and subnational) policy actors. These forms of governance open up new opportunities for <b>less-favoured</b> <b>regions,</b> although these continue to be constrained by already existing power relations between regions. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the implications of}} the alleged rise of the `knowledge economy' for regional economic change in Europe. In particular, it is concerned with `postindustrial' trajectories of <b>less-favoured</b> <b>regions,</b> in both the Western and Eastern parts of the `New Europe'. In doing so, the thesis critically engages with the `new regionalism' economic geography approaches that draw on institutional/evolutionary economics, and on the `knowledge economy' or 'learning economy' discourses. These approaches invariably identify localised forms of knowledge production and learning and various supporting institutions as key factors behind regional prosperity. Considered as the most important organisational units of contemporary global knowledge-intensive capitalism, economically successful regions are understood as `learning regions' acting as collectors and repositories of knowledge, and displaying the ability to learn and innovate, while being supported by regional `institutional thickness'. <b>Less-favoured</b> <b>regions</b> are themselves claimed to have a capacity to improve their own economic fortunes by becoming `learning regions'. These claims are exposed to a theoretical scrutiny that reveals serious conceptual weaknesses in the `knowledge economy' and `learning region' paradigms and the thesis suggests an alternative conceptualisation of regional economic change. This alternative conceptualisation places emphasis on the `socio-spatial divisions of labour' and the accompanying `socio-spatial value chains/networks' as a useful prism through which increasingly uneven regional development in Europe can be understood. The case studies of two former industrial region-states are then presented - one in the `Western' periphery (Scotland) and one in the `Eastern' post-socialist periphery (Slovakia) of the `New Europe' - both attempting a transformation to the high value-added `knowledge-based' economy. The empirical evidence supports the view that, although institutions can {{play an important role in}} economic development of regions, their room for manoeuvre is nevertheless significantly constrained by their own historical legacies and the wider neo-liberal political economy.

40|$|Despite all {{the talk}} of knowledge-driven, knowledge-based, and {{learning}} economies, it is not always clear or self-evident whether all countries, let alone regions, will share the spoils of emerging technological trends and changes. In particular, <b>less-favoured</b> <b>regions</b> (LFRs) like Scotland face a number of difficulties as a consequence of this emerging knowledge-based economy (KBE) and the strategies necessary to overcome their existing uneven position in order to adapt to new global economic imperatives. More specifically, the KBE agenda invokes strategies that do not adequately address the existing uneven development of LFRs in relation to “growth” regions that have the institutional infrastructure and arrangements necessary to attract and embed new forms of employment, new knowledge capacities, and new industrial sectors. However, this article will explore the institutional grounding of the life sciences sector in Scotland in order to consider how particular institutional arrangements that may appear disadvantageous can also lead to new, potentially advantageous arrangements that can help LFRs to avoid continuing economic stagnation or decline...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the spatial {{implications}} for Europe of major structural and institutional changes affecting the production system are examined. The concern {{is to establish}} whether these changes are enabling a greater localisation or globalisation of intrafirm and interfirm relations and, associated with this, greater scope for local economic development. The paper begins with a critical survey of an influential paradigm {{in which it is}} sustained that the transfer from Fordism to post-Fordism implies a return to regional economies. It is then argued that contemporary restructuring in Europe is very much a matter of a global extension of old and new forms of industrial organisation [...] a process which does not augur well for self-sustaining development at the local level. This thesis is further sustained and elaborated through a consideration, {{in the second half of}} the paper, of the implications for <b>less-favoured</b> <b>regions</b> related to the transition to market forms of spatial governance at the level of the nation-state, and, at the level of the European Community, the policy reforms connected to the completion of the Single European Market. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to shed light on the identification of the internal and external factors that affect the attitudes towards innovation of companies located in regions situated on the periphery of economic centres. The main research questions are as follows: (1) What are the internal factors that predispose companies to seek access to innovation? (2) To what extent do external factors such as location and technological opportunities condition or stimulate favourable attitudes towards innovation? To test the hypotheses put forward to answer these questions, we formulate and estimate econometric specifications, taking a sample of more than 2000 companies situated in Andalusia (one of the <b>less-favoured</b> <b>regions</b> in Spain). Our results show that the cost of innovation and the level of indebtedness of a company have a statistically significant and negative effect on attitudes to innovation, whereas the technical qualifications of the employees, the propensity to export, and the company size (measured by the number of employees) have a significant and positive effect on a company's attitude towards innovation. Furthermore, technological opportunities and location exert positive effects on attitudes towards innovation. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper offers}} some {{insights}} into scientific collaboration (SC) {{at the regional}} level by drawing upon two lines of inquiry. The first involves examining the spatial patterns of university SC across the EU- 15 (all countries belonging to the European Union between 1995 and 2004). The second consists of extending the current empirical analysis on regional SC collaboration by including the economic distance between regions in the model along with other variables suggested by the extant literature. The methodology relies on co-publications {{as a proxy for}} academic collaboration, and in order to test the relevance of economic distance for the intensity of collaboration between regions, we put forward a gravity equation. The descriptive results show that there are significant differences in the production of academic scientific papers between <b>less-favoured</b> <b>regions</b> and core regions. However, the intensity of collaboration is similar in both types of regions. Our econometric findings suggest that differences in scientific resources (as measured by R&D expenditure) between regions are relevant in explaining academic scientific collaborations, while distance in the level of development (as measured by per capita GDP) does not appear to play any significant role. Nevertheless, other variables in the analysis, including geographical distance, specialization and cultural factors, do yield significant estimated coefficients, and {{this is consistent with the}} previous literature on regional SC...|$|R

Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} a tremendous academic and political {{appeal to the}} regional scale as the key with which to rear economic and social revitalization. Learning from exemplars such as Baden W?rttemberg, certain proponents of a purported ?new regionalism? advocate that the economic and democratic deficit in <b>less-favoured</b> <b>regions</b> may be revitalized by fostering a series of interacting social, economic and institutional networks. This paper provides a discussion {{of some of the}} more sophisticated approaches heralding a regional renaissance. These are then deployed through a case study of the restructuring and rescaling of England's economic governance in the late 1990 s via the establishment of Regional Development Agencies (RDAs). Focusing on the experience of the North-West region, their analysis reveals that, whilst useful as a form of contextualizing regional transformation and governance, the new regionalist approaches are unable to provide a rigorous framework through which to consider England's own peculiar regional ?resurgence?. In turn, the authors call for a serious consideration of the state as a critical animateur in both structuring and scaling economic and civic life. The paper concludes that in future research, a lack of sensitivity to situated path-dependent regional economic and political geographies may serve to reproduce the ?fantasies? inherent in some earlier (post-Fordist) ?transition models'.

40|$|Broadband {{access is}} {{indispensable}} for advanced Internet services, because voluminous data transfers have recently become popular in developed societies. Although broadband access {{has spread to}} a certain degree in developed countries/regions, geographical gaps in broadband access (the so-called “geographical digital divide”) remain. Based on three case studies in less-favoured areas of Japan (Hokkaido, Nagano Prefecture and Mie Prefecture), we examined how the geographical digital divide is being bridged, and the contributions that national and local government policies make to this process. Several implications were apparent. First, integrating communication infrastructures with manifold digital services, such as cable television services and broadband access, is an effective way to extend broadband to less-favoured areas. The Japanese government has promoted the construction of digital cable television networks, and they have {{played a significant role in}} the completion of universal broadband services. The challenge of digitizing terrestrial television broadcasting has been behind these policies. Another effective means of extending broadband has been the pressure exerted by local governments (under the national policy scheme) on private cable television companies to bring their services to even the least populated regions. Finally, in those areas where private digital network services are unprofitable, the establishment of a publicly funded cable business (using a budget-transfer scheme, for example) may be an effective option for extending broadband services. In general, the challenge of bridging the geographical digital divide should be tackled with a broad set of regional promotion policies for <b>less-favoured</b> <b>regions...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{products}} bearing a Geographical Indication (GI) has increased steadily in recent years. The EU Commission considers GIs {{as a useful}} tool in fostering simultaneously the production of high-quality food products as well as rural development in <b>less-favoured</b> <b>regions.</b> However, GIs {{are by no means}} a self runner. In order to be successful consumers have to value GIs. So far empirical evidence with respect to consumers' knowledge, expectations and WTP towards GI products is rather mixed and mainly focused on Mediterranean countries. The present paper addresses both sides of the market, i. e. producers' motivations to establish a GI and consumers' expectations towards GI products by representing results from a German case study, i. e. Hessian apple wine. In November 2008, an online-survey with 741 Hessian consumers was carried out. In the same month, an in-depth interview with one of the leading producers of Hessian apple wine, who was directly involved in the PGI application process, was conducted. The results indicate that the most important motivation to apply for a PGI is to secure the established reputation against misuse by competing producers in order to ensure the quality level of Hessian apple wine. Hessian consumers' awareness and knowledge about GIs is very limited. Moreover, it is found that the quality-dimension is not as important as the local-economy support dimension and perceived authenticity of the product.

40|$|The {{issue of}} ‘equity gaps’ has loomed large in recent discussions of {{enterprise}} formation and development, {{both in the}} United Kingdom and in Germany. One particularly intriguing, but highly elusive, aspect of this issue {{is the question of}} whether equity gaps have a regional dimension: are certain regions at a systematic disadvantage with respect to the provision of equity capital? In this paper, we explore this question {{in the context of the}} UK and German venture capital industries, drawing both on unpublished industry data and on information obtained from original surveys of venture capital firms in the two countries. We report clear evidence that the venture industries in both countries are spatially constituted. Despite important national differences, venture capital firms tend to be concentrated in identifiable clusters and their investment outcomes show clear evidence of spatial proximity effects; investment is disproportionately concentrated in those regions that also contain the major clusters of venture capital firms. However, how far this spatial form produces regional equity gaps is hard to determine. Venture capitalists themselves argue that they do not intentionally discriminate between regions in their decisionmaking, and many acknowledge the existence of funding and deal-size gaps but not regional gaps per se. But their perception of project risk is, nevertheless, regionally sensitive. We argue that the notion of a simple supply gap overlooks the way in which the localised form of the industry is based on a dynamic learning process in which demand and supply processes combine with their embeddedness in social networks and individual perceptions in a mutually reinforcing way. <b>Less-favoured</b> <b>regions,</b> with low investment rates, few local venture capital firms, and a dearth of experienced specialist intermediaries, may thus be trapped in a situation of both depressed demand for and supply of venture capital investment. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the role of social capital and {{institutional}} networks in determining the capacity for learning and adaptation of the regional systems of governance within the European regional policy environment, by facilitating collective action among the actors and by shaping the local institutional interactions through the processes of exchange and socialization. The main hypothesis is that, although the Europeanization of public policy has a positive impact on the processes of institution-building, learning and adaptation at the local level, and particularly in the <b>less-favoured</b> <b>regions</b> of Europe, pre-existing qualitative features of the local institutional infrastructure play the most important role in the bottom-up learning and adaptation processes. In particular, the presence of dense institutional networks between public and private actors and social capital endowments that enable them {{to be involved in the}} provision of public goods and services facilitates the learning process, that is the capacity of institutional networks to adapt their structure and policies to meet the changing politico-economic conditions (European environment). The research compares the response of two regions of Greece (Southern and Northern Aegean Islands) -similar in physical resources and financial support provided by the national and European regional policy-to the challenges of Europeanization. Chapter one establishes the general theoretical framework of the thesis, linking social capital, institutional networks and learning within the theory of regional development. Chapter two defines learning and adaptation in European regional policy and establishes the main theoretical hypotheses of the thesis, the methodology for measuring specific structural features of the networks and social capital, and criteria for assessing the learning capacity. Chapter three presents the structural and cultural specificities of the Greek socio-political system, as well as the main aspects of the national regional policy. Chapters four and five map the institutional infrastructure in both regions, drawing their political, economic, institutional and cultural features. Chapters six and seven examine the processes of institutional and policy adaptation to European structural policy in both regions and evaluate their learning capacity. Finally, chapter eight compares the two cases and draws general conclusions regarding the role of social capital and institutional networks in facilitating learning and adaptation within European regional policy and extracts main implications for integration theory...|$|R
40|$|In {{the era of}} {{knowledge}} society many regions and local communities/ towns are trying to compete with larger, growing cities over the knowledge and intellectual capital resources. Regional or local knowledge environment has become more important. Building innovation capacity and the institutional capacity as one part of {{it could be a}} development tool to some lagging behind-regions, (which are called as <b>less-favoured</b> <b>regions)</b> and quite often do not have universities of their own or successful industries. There are regions, which are building their institutional base by forming university-industry collaborated knowledge transfer institutions and models through networking. Furthermore, these institutions are taking part in the local networks shaping the technological change or transformation in the region. For the beginning {{there is a need for}} structures and institutional base strong enough to create critical mass or capabilities. Further there is a need for relationships, which are many times in the forms of networks, between both organisational and non-organisational, formal and informal institutions. Thirdly, the process of institutionalisation is also a crucial element of the development in the less favoured regions (see Healey et al. 1999, Amin & Thrift 1995, Henry 2001). The aim of this paper is to study what kind of collaboration models research and development institutions and actors have formed in the less favoured region for technology transfer and further improving local innovation capacity and technological change. Further the aim is to describe the possible transformation actions appeared in these case regions. The paper is about a process tracking of industrial, technology and innovation development processes in Sein 4 joki and Pori town regions. Sein 4 joki and Pori sub-regions are the examples of disadvantaged regions in Finland (either peripheral areas or without clear university based education or research), which are building a strong institutional base of higher education (and research) institutions and university-based knowledge transfer systems in order to promote innovations and business development. The category of industrial development to be applied in these cases is a diversification of industries that are already present in the region, from traditional manufacturing to applying new technologies. The studied technology areas are certain parts of automation technology, more particularly intelligent products and systems (mechatronics and applied software).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project is to understand {{the link between the}} adoption of ICT tools and the economic development of a peripheral region. This study is focused on the current status of adoption of ICT tools by a sample of SMEs operating in a peripheral island, the Autonomous Region of Madeira, Portugal. The overt optimism propagated by supra-national organisations such as the EU, stresses that the adoption of ICT tools constitutes one of the key strategic weapons in overcoming the peripheral/remote character and competitiveness problems of <b>less-favoured</b> <b>regions.</b> This argument is based on evidence (core region based) that suggests a causal link between investment in ICTs and economic growth. However, {{there is no evidence to}} prove such a linkage in peripheral regions. The argument developed in this thesis is that a large scale adoption of ICT tools may have neutral or even negative effects on regional development prospects, in the specific context of remote island economies. The development of this new line of reasoning assumes that the examination of the potential contribution of ICTs in increasing growth prospects should be based on: an indepth analysis of the territorial dynamics of the region under analysis; the growth options available in such a specific territory; the degree of preparedness to embrace ICT tools; and the local firms' response to the on-going technological revolution. It is concluded, in line with the expectations developed in the thesis, that the large scale adoption of sophisticated ICT tools - namely, the adoption of complex e-commerce platforms - has not occurred in Madeira. It is also evident that the widespread adoption of ICT tools cannot provide a short term answer to island development problems. The current growth path is strongly conditioned by geographical constraints and by specialisation in traditional sectors, which cannot be reversed overnight. However, although the adoption of ICT tools such as the Internet has not impacted upon the macro-economy level, it does have consequences at the micro (firms) level for those firms making intensive use of Internet functionalities. This study, although based on quite a specific geographical and economic context, may provide interesting theoretical insights to be explored further. In fact, it is suggested that the traditional EU approach focused on increasing levels of general awareness should be reoriented towards a more promising focal point such as increasing the levels of effective use of ICT tools. Finally, {{this research}} project provides evidence to suggest that in the absence of a favourable macroeconomic environment, the adoption and use of ICT tools only increases the 'selection mechanism' at work (ie which firms survive, and which fail). As larger firms have the greater capacity to adopt complex ICT tools, any advantage arising from the adoption of such technologies will be concentrated on those firms already at an advantage. In the end it can be asserted that the traditional development strategies (personified by investments in transport and other 'hard' infrastructures) should continue to be pursued for the time being, in order to avoid the negative consequences of reduced income transfers in the period until a new cycle of development can be established in islands such as Madeira.

40|$|Background of the {{document}} With the 6 th Framework Programme (FP 6) having entered into its second half, preparations are underway for FP 7 {{which is due to}} be launched in late 2006. The multi-annual framework programmes are an important instrument for the implementation of the European Research Area, and the activities in the area of "Human Resources and Mobility", i. e. the Marie Curie Actions, are an essential part of this. At a "Stakeholders Meeting" in Brussels on 20 December 2004, the European Commission presented its ideas and proposals regarding the future of the Marie Curie Actions to a selected group of participants. The Chair of the MCFA attended this meeting on behalf of the Association. Shortly before the meeting the Commission sent a number of (draft) documents to the participants in order to prepare the discussions. These documents were declared "confidential" so that the MCFA did not have the chance to conduct a broad consultation of its members regarding the Commission's plans for the Marie Curie Actions in FP 7. However, following internal discussions the MCFA Administrative Board and Advisory Board prepared a document in reply to the proposals discussed at the meeting. This document was sent to the Commission in early January 2005. Marie Curie Actions in FP 7 - proposals by the European Commission 	"Individual Marie Curie fellowships for life-long training and career development" For the Individual Marie Curie Fellowships the European Commission suggests the co-funding of regional, national or international programmes which are corresponding to the Framework Programme objectives. The individual applicants would then submit their proposals to the co-funded programme under a joint Marie Curie fellowship action and the programme's label. During a transitional period the current application mode would remain in existence. However, the idea is to phase out the current (Intra-European) Individual fellowships completely and to switch entirely to a co-funding mechanism. 	"Marie Curie Networks (MCN) for early-stage researchers" The European Commission plans to merge the actions Early Stage Research Training (EST) and Research Training Networks (RTN) to one single action, the "Marie Curie Networks" (MCN) in FP 7. This action would be implemented through the selection of small- to medium sized networks with typically not less than 3 and not more than 10 partners. 	"Expanding the industry dimension in Marie Curie Actions in FP 7 " The participation of industry in the Marie Curie Actions will receive special attention in FP 7. In order to achieve this, the Commission proposes a new Industry-Academia partnership scheme, similar to the one currently implemented in FP 6, but with more flexible rules concerning the criteria for the eligibility of researchers to be recruited within this scheme. 	"Realising the full research potential of EU 25 : The “XXXX” scheme" The main objective of this new scheme is to expand the collaborations between research centres/researchers from <b>less-favoured</b> <b>regions</b> in Europe and other EU research centres. It includes special measures to fight brain-drain from the less favoured regions of the EU and to encourage the return of nationals from these regions having left their country. 	"The international dimension of Marie Curie Actions in FP 7 " (draft) Under this header the Incoming/Outgoing International Fellowships are discussed, which will be continued but with more flexible conditions. It is proposed that the International Reintegration Grants shall become available to researchers having left Europe for three years (instead of the current five years).
