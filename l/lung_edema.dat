25|$|Zinc {{chloride}} {{is extremely}} {{detrimental to the}} lungs, and pulmonary exposure to zinc chloride smoke resulted in ten fatalities. Inhalation of fumes of zinc, zinc oxide, or zinc chloride leads to pulmonary edema and metal fume fever. Onset occurs within 4–6 h and may be delayed up to 8 h. Symptoms include rapid breathing, dyspnea, cough, fever, shivering, sweating, chest and leg pain, myalgias, fatigue, metallic taste, salivation, thirst, and leukocytosis, which can last from 24 to 48 h. In cases of fume inhalation, cortisone preparations should be applied immediately (e.g., by inhalation of Auxiloson) to avoid development of <b>lung</b> <b>edema.</b>|$|E
25|$|Opium {{contains}} two main groups of alkaloids. Phenanthrenes such as morphine, codeine, and thebaine {{are the main}} psychoactive constituents. Isoquinolines such as papaverine and noscapine have no significant central nervous system effects, and are not regulated under the Controlled Substances Act. Morphine is the most prevalent and important alkaloid in opium, consisting of 10–16 percent of the total, and is {{responsible for most of}} its harmful effects such as <b>lung</b> <b>edema,</b> respiratory difficulties, coma, or cardiac or respiratory collapse. Morphine binds to and activates mu opioid receptor in the brain, spinal cord, stomach and intestine. Regular use can lead to drug tolerance or physical dependence. Chronic opium addicts in 1906 China or modern-day Iran consume an average of eight grams of opium daily.|$|E
25|$|Methyl {{isocyanate}} (MIC) {{is extremely}} toxic. The {{threshold limit value}} set by the American Conference on Government Industrial Hygienists is 0.02 ppm. MIC is toxic by inhalation, ingestion and contact in quantities as low as 0.4 ppm. Exposure symptoms includes coughing, chest pain, dyspnea, asthma, irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, as well as skin damage. Higher levels of exposure, over 21 ppm, can result in pulmonary or <b>lung</b> <b>edema,</b> emphysema and hemorrhages, bronchial pneumonia and death. Although the odor of methyl isocyanate cannot be detected at 5 ppm by most people, its potent lachrymal properties provide an excellent warning of its presence (at a concentration of 2–4 parts per million (ppm) subject's eyes are irritated, while at 21 ppm, subjects could not tolerate the presence of methyl isocyanate in air).|$|E

2500|$|Phenol and its vapors are {{corrosive}} to the eyes, the skin, and {{the respiratory}} tract. Its corrosive effect on skin and mucous membranes {{is due to}} a protein-degenerating effect. Repeated or prolonged skin contact with phenol may cause dermatitis, or even second and third-degree burns. [...] Inhalation of phenol vapor may cause <b>lung</b> <b>edema.</b> The substance may cause harmful effects on the central nervous system and heart, resulting in dysrhythmia, seizures, and coma. The kidneys may be affected as well. Long-term or repeated exposure of the substance may have harmful effects on the liver and kidneys. There is no evidence that phenol causes cancer in humans. Besides its hydrophobic effects, another mechanism for the toxicity of phenol may be the formation of phenoxyl radicals.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{vascular}} permeability characterizes <b>lung</b> injury pulmonary <b>edema</b> and renders fluid {{balance in}} the injured lung especially sensitive to changes in hydrostatic pressure. Pulmonary edema {{is often associated with}} increased sympathetic nervous system activity which can lead to pulmonary venoconstriction. This postcapillary venoconstriction could raise microvascular pressure and might therefore increase edema in the injured lung. We produced <b>lung</b> injury <b>edema</b> in dogs with oleic acid and directly measured small (less than 2 mm) pulmonary vein pressure. We found that the small pulmonary vein pressure was increased from 9. 8 +/- 0. 5 mmHg to 12. 6 +/- 0. 5 mmHg (n = 10) by oleic acid injury edema. The increase was not due to a rise in left atrial pressure since the small pulmonary vein-left atrial pressure gradient also increased. To test if this increase in the postcapillary pressure gradient was sympathetically mediated, we either unilaterally ablated the stellate ganglion or produced unilateral alpha adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine before giving oleic acid. Both of these "antisympathetic" interventions prevented the increase in pulmonary vein pressure caused by oleic acid edema in the protected lung but not in the intact contralateral lung. These interventions produced a 30 +/- 6. 8 % reduction in the amount of edema caused by oleic acid. Restoring the increase in small vein pressure by inflating a balloon in the left atrium of dogs with bilateral stellate ganglion ablations abolished the reduction in edema produced by antisympathetic treatment. However, the decrease in edema was not significantly correlated with the reduction in pulmonary vein pressure. Thus, the mechanism of the effects of these antisympathetic interventions remains unclear. We conclude that <b>lung</b> injury <b>edema</b> causes sympathetically mediated pulmonary venoconstriction and that antisympathetic interventions significantly reduce <b>lung</b> injury <b>edema</b> and microvascular pressure...|$|R

5000|$|Pulmonary edema is fluid {{accumulation}} in {{the tissue}} and air {{spaces of the}} lungs. It leads to impaired gas exchange and may cause respiratory failure. It is due to either failure of the left ventricle of the heart to remove blood adequately from the pulmonary circulation (cardiogenic pulmonary edema), or an injury to the lung parenchyma or vasculature of the <b>lung</b> (noncardiogenic pulmonary <b>edema).</b> Treatment is focused on three aspects: firstly improving respiratory function, secondly, treating the underlying cause, and thirdly avoiding further damage to the <b>lung.</b> Pulmonary <b>edema,</b> especially acute, can lead to fatal respiratory distress or cardiac arrest due to hypoxia.

40|$|The basic {{phospholipase}} A(2) (VRV-PL-VIIIa) from Vipera russelli venom induces multiple toxic effects including neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, edema and hemorrhage. This phospholipase A(2) {{has been}} extensively characterized for its pharmacological properties except for hemorrhagic activity. In the present investigation, the lung hemorrhagic activity was assayed using lung dye diffusion method. The investigations to understand the mechanism of lung hemorrhage induction by VRV-PL-VIIIa was followed by chemical modification studies and also by interaction with an antihemorrhagic factor p-anisic acid (4 -methoxy benzoic acid). In presence of 1 : 2 mol:mol PLA(2) : anisic acid, the <b>lung</b> hemorrhagic and <b>edema</b> inducing activities were completely neutralized in experimental animals; however, catalytic and anticoagulant activities were not neutralized. Carbamylation of VRV-PL-VIIIa resulted {{in the loss of}} <b>lung</b> hemorrhage and <b>edema</b> inducing activities. In contrast, carbamylation of VRV-PL-VIIIa in the presence of anisic acid could not neutralize the <b>lung</b> hemorrhage and <b>edema</b> inducing activities. The anticoagulant and enzyme activities were only partially neutralized when carbamylated both in the presence and absence of anisic acid. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
