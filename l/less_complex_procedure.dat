40|$|AbstractBackground/PurposeSoft tissue {{necrosis}} {{after the}} repair of a ruptured tendo Achillis {{is a difficult}} problem commonly encountered by orthopaedic surgeons. Such wounds are difficult to manage because of the tenuous blood supply and the characteristic anatomical features of the area. Flaps such as the reverse sural flap, medial plantar flap, gastrocnemius flap and free flaps cover such wounds with a good success rate. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} the use of a dorsalis pedis artery (DPA) -based flap to cover a wound over the tendo Achillis insertion area. MethodsWe report a series of 11 patients in whom wounds over the tendo Achillis insertion area were covered with a DPA-based flap. Between 1995 and 2012, 11 patients (nine men and two women), who were referred to us with a nonhealing wound over the tendo Achillis because of soft tissue necrosis after the open repair of a ruptured tendon, were selected for soft tissue coverage of the wound by using a DPA-based flap. ResultsThe average follow-up period was 2. 4 years (range, 1 – 6 years). The mean operative time was 1. 7 hours (range, 1. 5 – 2. 0  hours).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ultrasound {{screening}} for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) {{has been shown}} to decrease aneurysm related mortality. Likely by providing an opportunity to intervene while the aneurysm is still intact, but possibly also when and the anatomy still relatively uncomplicated which would provide a <b>less</b> <b>complex</b> <b>procedure.</b> Our aim was to retrospectively investigate the complexity of repair for screening-detected AAAs in a cohort of 65 -year-old men. METHODS: All screening detected AAA cases that underwent repair between Sept 2010 and June 2014 in the most southern region of Sweden were included. Procedures were classified as either standard or complex. A standard procedure was defined as either standard EVAR (endovascular aneurysm repair) within the manufacturers Instructions For Use (IFU) or open repair with infrarenal clamping followed by a tube graft repair. All other types of procedures were defined as complex. The prevalence rate of AAA, screening compliance, short-and midterm outcome of the operations were reported. RESULTS: From the 35513 men invited to screening, 27 951 (78. 7 %) attended screening with ultrasound. AAA 30 mm was found in 561 cases, yielding a prevalence rate of 2. 0 %. Forty-eight patients underwent AAA repair. A percentage of 43. 8 % of these were classified as complex procedures. These consisted mostly of branched/fenestrated EVAR or EVAR with simultaneous exclusion of common iliac aneurysm. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms contemporary prevalence rates of AAA. Almost half (43. 8 %) of screening-detected AAA required complex operations, a significant proportion. The complex aneurysms were, on average, larger than the non-complex cases and {{they were more likely to}} be cases that required surgery immediately after screening detection. Our data suggests that the nature of AAA is heterogenous, even in the screening-detected group requiring operation. This should spur interest in more studies to investigate this issue...|$|E
40|$|Introduction : Kinesiology-style {{manual muscle testing}} (kMMT) is a {{non-invasive}} {{assessment method}} used by various types of practitioners to detect {{a wide range of}} target conditions. It is distinctly different from the muscle testing performed in orthopaedic/neurological settings and from Applied kinesiology. Despite being estimated to be used by over 1 million people worldwide, the usefulness of kMMT has not yet been established. The aim of this thesis was to assess the validity of kMMT by examining its accuracy and precision. Methods : A series of 5 diagnostic test accuracy studies were undertaken. In the first study, the index test was kMMT, and the target condition was deceit in verbal statements spoken by Test Patients (TPs). The comparator reference standard was a true gold standard: the actual verity of the spoken statement. The outcomes of the muscle tests were interpreted consistently: a weak result indicated a Lie and a strong result indicated a Truth. A secondary index test was included as a comparator: Intuition, where Practitioners used intuition (without using kMMT) to ascertain if a Lie or Truth was spoken. Forty-eight Practitioners were recruited and paired with 48 unique kMMT-naïve TPs. Each Pair performed 60 kMMTs broken up into 6 blocks of 10, which alternated with blocks of 10 Intuitions. For each Pair, an overall percent correct was calculated for both kMMT and Intuition, and their means were compared. Also calculated for both tests were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. The second study was a replication of the first, using a sample size of 20 Pairs and a <b>less</b> <b>complex</b> <b>procedure.</b> In the third study, grip strength dynamometry replaced kMMT as the primary index test. In the fourth study, the reproducibility and repeatability of kMMT were examined. In the final study, TPs were presented with emotionally-arousing stimuli in addition to the affect-neutral stimuli used in previous studies, to assess if stimuli valence impacted kMMT accuracy. Results : Throughout this series of studies, mean kMMT accuracies (95 % Confidence Intervals; CIs) ranged from 0. 594 (0. 541 – 0. 647) to 0. 659 (0. 623 - 0. 695) and mean Intuition accuracies, from 0. 481 (0. 456 - 0. 506) to 0. 526 (0. 488 - 0. 564). In all studies, mean kMMT accuracies were found to be significantly different from mean Intuition accuracies (p ≤ 0. 01), and from Chance (p < 0. 01). On the other hand, no difference was found between grip strength following False statements compared to grip strength following True statements (p = 0. 61). In addition, the Practitioner-TP complex accounted for 57 % of the variation in kMMT accuracy, with 43 % unaccounted for. Also, {{there was no difference in}} the mean kMMT accuracy when using emotionally-arousing stimuli compared to when using affect-neutral stimuli (p = 0. 35). Mean sensitivities (95 % CI) ranged from 0. 503 (0. 421 - 0. 584) to 0. 659 (0. 612 - 0. 706) while mean specificities (95 % CI) ranged from 0. 638 (0. 430 - 0. 486) to 0. 685 (0. 616 - 0. 754). Finally, while a number of participant characteristic seemed to influence kMMT accuracy during one study or another, no one specific characteristic was found to influence kMMT accuracy consistently (i. e. across the series of studies). Discussion : This series of studies has shown that kMMT can be investigated using rigorous evidence-based health care methods. Furthermore, for distinguishing lies from truths, kMMT has repeatedly been found to be significantly more accurate than both Intuition and Chance. Practitioners appear to be an integral part of the kMMT dynamic because when replaced by a mechanical device (i. e. a grip strength dynamometer), distinguishing Lies from Truth was not possible. In addition, since specificities seemed to be greater than sensitivities, Truths may have been easier to detect than Lies. A limitation of this series of studies is that I have a potential conflict of interest, in that I am a practitioner of kMMT who gets paid to perform kMMT. Another limitation is these results are not generalisable to other applications of kMMT, such as its use in other paradigms or using muscles other than the deltoid. Also, these results suggest that kMMT may be about 60 % accurate, which is statistically different from Intuition and Chance; however it has not been established if 60 % correct is "good enough" in a clinical context. As such, further research is needed to assess its clinical utility, such as randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of whole kMMT technique systems. Also, future investigators may want to explore what factors, such as specific Practitioner and TP characteristics, influence kMMT accuracy, and to investigate the validity of using kMMT to detect other target conditions, using other reference standards and muscles other than the deltoid. Summary : This series of diagnostic test accuracy studies has found that kMMT can be investigated using rigorous methods, and that kMMT used to distinguish Lies from Truths is significantly more accurate that both Intuition and Chance. Further research is needed to assess kMMT’s clinical utility. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|E

Clinical and environmental outbreak-related isolates showed closely related amplicon patterns. Eleven strains of unrelated origins displayed 10 distinct patterns.

Legionella pneumophila strains isolated from a hospital water system and from patients involved in a nosocomial outbreak {{were found to be}} clonally related and distinct from control strains by several genotypic methods (5). However, most of the genotypic typing assays have specific experimen-tal drawbacks, and <b>less</b> <b>complex</b> <b>procedures</b> are required.

The epidemiologic usefulness of PCR fingerprinting requires evaluation of its reliability on the basis of epidemiologic evidence and comparisons with other molecular typing methods.

40|$|Nowadays {{laparoscopic surgery}} is the {{standard}} procedure for many abdominal diseases. Compared with open surgery, laparoscopic surgery offers several advantages, such as reduction of postoperative pain, faster postoperative recovery and shorter admission times to the hospital. The continuous drive to further improve the surgical technique resulted {{in the development of}} new less invasive techniques like single-port laparoscopy. Single-port laparoscopic procedures are laparoscopic procedures using only one incision, which is usually transumbilical. At the site of this single incision a multiport device is placed, instead of multiple incisions with multiple ports through which the surgical instruments can be introduced. All instruments can be introduced in the abdomen through this multiport device. By using only one incision surgical trauma is further minimized and thereby further reducing postoperative pain and fasten postoperative recovery which is accompanied by a better cosmetic result. The first single-port laparoscopic procedure, an appendectomy, was performed in 1992. Five years later the first single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. After several years the technique was introduced in the Netherlands. In 2010 the first single-port laparoscopic procedure was performed in the Jeroen Bosch Hospital. In the first three studies (Chapter II, III and IV) of this thesis the results of single-port laparoscopic procedures during the first years of its use in the Jeroen Bosch Hospital are described. The single-port technique was primarily introduced in <b>less</b> <b>complex</b> <b>procedures.</b> The fourth study presented in this thesis (Chapter V) describes the results of a cost-analysis of single-port laparoscopic procedures in the treatment of malignant colorectal diseases. Not only the single-port technique has been introduced to minimize surgical trauma, also robotics have been introduced. In the last study (Chapter VI) the results of the use of robotics in single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomies are presented. The use of robotics is feasible, but is encountered by technical challenges. Also high rates of incisional herniation were seen. The use of robotics is quite expensive. With the lack of convincing benefits and the high costs, the use of robotics cannot be justified for single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Further research is needed for the use of robotics in more <b>complex</b> <b>procedures.</b> Single-port laparoscopy is becoming more accepted in the treatment of various diseases. The influence of single-port laparoscopy on cosmetic outcome and quality of life should be investigated as well as the cost effectiveness technique.

The existence of hundreds of theoretical and real pattern recognition devices forms an ideal basis for research on the structures of various approaches and their comparison. The task of pattern recognition is to select a hypotheses out of a set (e. g. : figures 0, …, 9) on the basis of given data (e. g. the black and white points of a digitized picture). There exists an ideal classifier to solve this problem as the theorem of Bayes provides a logically perfect connection between the input data and the result.

40|$|Advances in {{technology}} have shaped {{the history of}} surgical procedures. Recent developments have allowed surgical procedures to become less invasive than traditional open procedures. The transition to Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) has resulted in decreased recovery times, improved cosmetic results, and reduced costs. For these reasons, there is interest in further reducing the invasiveness of surgical procedures by accessing the abdominal cavity through a single incision, such as with Laparoendoscopic Single-Site (LESS) surgery. Added complexities, such as unintuitive controls and limited dexterity, prevent the widespread adoption of <b>LESS</b> for <b>complex</b> surgical <b>procedures.</b> Multi-functional in vivo surgical robots {{have been designed to}} overcome the issues associated with LESS procedures. Three different generations of four-degree-of-freedom (4 -DOF) miniature in vivo surgical robots have been designed, analyzed, and tested to determine their feasibility for LESS procedures. The robotic platform consists of a two-armed robotic prototype and a remote surgeon interface. For surgical procedures, each arm of the robot is completely inserted individually through a small incision and then assembled within the abdominal cavity. Benchtop tests and in vivo surgical procedures have been used to demonstrate the efficacy of using a robotic platform over traditional laparoscopic tools. The robotic systems have shown significant benefits including access to all quadrants in the peritoneal cavity, improved visualization and dexterity, and intuitive controls...|$|R
