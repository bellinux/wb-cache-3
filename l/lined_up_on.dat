5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, all the cars <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the grid per FIA race procedure. As Charlie Whiting signalled the green light to start the {{formation}} lap, a full field of twenty cars set off as normal for a single lap before forming the starting grid. At the banked Turn 13, the entrance to the pit lane (and the turn that was the centre of the controversy), all teams that ran Michelin tyres returned to their pits, leaving just six cars from the three Bridgestone teams (Ferrari, Jordan, and Minardi) to start the race.|$|E
5|$|Kubica had {{problems}} when running the soft compound tyre managing seventh but {{was happy with}} his lap in the final part of qualifying. He was ahead of Massa in the faster of the two Ferrari cars. Petrov secured ninth in the slower Renault car. Kobayashi rounded out the top ten fastest qualifiers. Sutil was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session in eleventh; his best time of 1:27.525 was eight tenths of a second slower than Vettel's pace in the second session. Alonso recorded the twelfth fastest time and could not secure {{a position in the}} final session as his car touched a white line under braking on the circuit, causing his car to slide. Nevertheless, Alonso thought that the error did not cost him time. He was followed by Pedro de la Rosa in the other Sauber car in 13th, who in turn, was ahead of Sébastien Buemi for Torro Rosso and Williams driver Rubens Barrichello. This formation continued on the eighth row of the grid, which was occupied by Jaime Alguersuari in the second Torro Rosso and Nico Hülkenberg in the other Williams. Vitantonio Liuzzi failed to move beyond the first session; the Force India driver qualified in 18th. The Lotus cars of Heikki Kovalainen and Jarno Trulli lined up in 19th and 20th respectively. Timo Glock and Bruno Senna <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the eleventh row of the grid, with their teammates Lucas di Grassi and Karun Chandhok qualifying {{at the rear of the}} field.|$|E

25|$|It {{is known}} as the Battle of Split Allegiances among the Camerons.

25|$|On July 7, 2017, Air Canada Flight 759, an A320-200 was {{instructed}} by {{air traffic control}} to go around after overflying Taxiway C for 0.25 miles (400 m) while on visual approach for 28R. The A320 overflew the first two aircraft <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Taxiway C by roughly 100 feet (30 m). The pilots landed the aircraft afterwards without incident. A total of three wide-body aircraft and one narrow-body aircraft were lined up awaiting takeoff on Taxiway C. The NTSB is investigating.|$|E
25|$|The purges {{affected}} {{the leadership of}} the VVS. In June 1941, 91 per cent of major formation leaders had been in place for just six months. With the exception of Major General Aleksandr Novikov, commanding the Leningrad District, most would fail in their posts and pay for that failure with their lives. A critical operational omission of the VVS was the failure to disperse its aircraft. Soviet aircraft was left closely ‘bunched’ into groups, and <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> airfields, making a very easy target for the Germans.|$|E

25|$|At the time, {{the players}} ascended a podium {{to receive their}} medals and then <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the ice for the playing of the {{national}} anthem, as the podium was only meant to accommodate one person.

Today, podiums are not used for ice hockey; the teams line up on their respective bluelines after the final game.|$|E
25|$|A small {{mortuary}} structure building used {{to stand}} at the entrance of the cemetery. Following this structure, small mausoleums, crypts and niches were <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a central pathway that led to a small chapel located {{at the center of the}} cemetery. The cemetery was totally enclosed by very high walls that still remain. Most mausoleums and crypts were constructed following the neo-classical style trend that prevailed at the time. Thick walls and piers were used as the main structural system. These were constructed using brick/"argarnasa", stone and mortar.|$|E
25|$|Nondisjunction usually {{occurs as}} the result of a {{weakened}} mitotic checkpoint, as these checkpoints tend to arrest or delay cell division until all components of the cell are ready to enter the next phase. If a checkpoint is weakened, the cell may fail to 'notice' that a chromosome pair is not <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the mitotic plate, for example. In such a case, most chromosomes would separate normally (with one chromatid ending up in each cell), while others could fail to separate at all. This would generate a daughter cell lacking a copy and a daughter cell with an extra copy.|$|E
5000|$|Linebackers: The jack linebacker <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> {{the outside}} {{shoulder}} of the strong tight end and, like a defensive lineman, <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the <b>line</b> of scrimmage. He ensures nothing gets outside of him on the run. He can do multiple coverages on the pass or he can blitz. The charley linebacker will <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the <b>line</b> of scrimmage and on the inside {{shoulder of the}} tight end, to cover the tight end or {{making it difficult for}} the tight end to release easily. The middle linebacker will <b>line</b> <b>up</b> about four to four and a half yards off the line of scrimmage and {{directly in front of the}} strong offensive tackle.|$|R

50|$|Requirements for {{defensive}} tackles {{are highly}} dependent on the version of the defense being played. For example, the 4-4 of Joe Roman requires quickness, size, and a player no taller than 6' 4". In the 4-4 Split of Roman, the defensive tackles <b>line</b> <b>up</b> heads <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the offensive guard, or perhaps on their outside shoulder. In the 'G front' of Frank Beamer's teams, the weak side tackle <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the inside shoulder of the offensive guard, and the strong side tackle <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the outside shoulder of the offensive guard.|$|R
25|$|Xu {{returned}} to Beijing, {{where he received}} a hero's welcome arranged by the Anhui clique. By December, {{he was back in}} Urga to organise a formal ceremony for the transfer of authority: soldiers were <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> either side of the road to the Bogd Khaan's palace; the portrait of the President of China was borne on a palanquin; the flag of the Chinese republic followed, and after it a marching band. Mongols were required to prostrate themselves repeatedly before these symbols of Chinese sovereignty. That night, some Mongolian herdsmen and lamas gathered outside the palace and tore down the flags of the Chinese Republic hanging from the gate.|$|E
25|$|At Jericho Mills, Warren {{found the}} river ford unprotected. He ordered Brig. Gen. Charles Griffin's {{division}} to wade across {{and establish a}} beachhead. By 4:30p.m., {{the rest of the}} corps crossed on pontoon bridges. Hearing from a prisoner that Confederates were camped nearby at the Virginia Central Railroad, Warren arranged his men into battle lines: the division of Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the left, Griffin's on the right. Brig. Gen. Lysander Cutler's division then began moving onto Griffin's right. General Lee convinced his Third Corps commander, A.P. Hill, that Warren's movement was simply a feint, so Hill sent only a single division, commanded by Maj. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox, along with artillery commanded by Col. William J. Pegram, to deal with Warren's supposedly minor threat.|$|E
25|$|However, the Thai {{artillery}} strongpoint at Ban Na {{had come}} under siege {{during the opening}} of Campaign 74B. Now the 165th Regiment from the 312th Division joined the attack. However, weather {{was not the only}} hindrance to close air support for the Thais; U.S. tactical air was also being diverted to bomb North Vietnam. Instead, BC 605 and BC 606 were tasked with seizing Hill 1663, four kilometers southwest of Ban Na. On 29 March, they <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the landing zone for insertion into a landing zone at the foot of Hill 1663. Forty troopers from BC 605 deserted rather than load up; they walked back to Long Tieng. The dutiful Thai troops were stalled {{at the base of the}} hill after they landed, fended off by a lightly manned PAVN defense.|$|E

25|$|It was March 1968 at a minor club meeting when 17-year-old racer Barry Sheene <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the {{starting}} grid, on a works 125cc Bultaco, {{for his first}} race. It was an impressive debut by anyone's standards. Sheene had {{worked his way up}} to second place and threatening the leader, Mike Lewis, when the bike seized and spat its rider off over the handlebars. A rostrum position in the day's 250cc race was a great achievement, but an even better wasn’t very far away. Just one week later, and again at Brands, Sheene took his first race win, and he did it is style by an incredible 12 seconds. And the best was yet to come, for he dominated a field of 350cc machines, riding special 250cc Bultaco (with an enlarged 280cc capacity).|$|E
25|$|On April 15 {{humanitarian}} aid organizations were granted {{access to the}} camp {{for the first time}} since the invasion had begun. Palestinian Red Crescent Society and International Committee of the Red Cross staff entered the camp, accompanied by the IDF. Officials from the Red Crescent told lawyer Hassan Jabareen that the IDF did not allow them to move around the camps freely, and that advanced decomposition, as well as the enormous destruction in the camp, made it impossible to find and retrieve bodies without the proper equipment. That same day Adalah and LAW, the Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment, filed a petition asking the Court to order the IDF to immediately hand over the bodies of Palestinians to the Red Cross or the Red Crescent, saying that the bodies of dead Palestinians were being left to rot in the camp. On April 19, a day after Israeli troops withdrew from the camp, journalists reported counting about 23 bodies that were <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the outdoor grounds of the clinic, before being quickly buried by Palestinians.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Nicholas Meyer {{was brought}} in to direct the sixth film in the series: [...] Roddenberry and he clashed creatively, as Roddenberry felt that having the Enterprise crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer {{described}} a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying:His guys were <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> one side of the room, and my guys were <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> {{the other side of the}} room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically, I came out of it feeling not very good, and I've not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of the day, I was going to go out and make the movie. I didn't have to take him on. Not my finest hour. In Joel Engel's biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a [...] "good job". [...] In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner's memoirs report that after the screening he called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused.|$|E

500|$|Schulz {{returned}} to coaching in 1913 as the line coach and chief assistant coach for Fielding H. Yost at Michigan. [...] He held that position for three seasons from 1913–1915. [...] While {{working as an}} assistant coach at Michigan, Schulz has been credited with introducing the technique of overshifting a lineman on defense. [...] In 1913, Schulz developed a new blocking technique by shifting one of the linemen. [...] Coach Yost was unconvinced until Schulz performed a demonstration using Michigan's left guard Royce Traphagen. [...] Schulz first put Traphagen in the line position designated by Yost, Schulz <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> {{the other side of the}} line and charged, [...] "almost wrecking Traphagen". [...] Then, Schulz had the groggy Traphagen line up in the spot designated by Schulz, and when Schulz charged he missed. [...] Schulz implemented the overshift technique during the 1913 season.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{was fascinated}} by the Zeus debate, {{especially}} the way that scientists were <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> diametrically opposed positions for or against the system. He commented to Wiesner, [...] "I don’t understand. Scientists are supposed to be rational people. How can there be such differences on a technical issue?" [...] His fascination grew and he eventually compiled a mass of material on Zeus which took up one corner of a room where he spent hundreds of hours becoming an expert on the topic. In one meeting with Edward Teller, Kennedy demonstrated that he knew more about the Zeus and ABMs than Teller. Teller then expended considerable effort to bring himself up to the same level of knowledge. Wiesner would later note that the pressure to make a decision built up until [...] "Kennedy came to feel that the only thing anybody in the country was concerned about was Nike-Zeus." ...|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, {{the second}} barrage {{of the fort}} began on 1 June; by then, Bergholtz had 13 {{additional}} cannon at his disposal. The barrage lasted until 6 June, {{as a result of}} which [...] "there was made a great breach, that two battalions were <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> either side to take the city". During those six days, there were a total of 2,975 mortar shots and 1,539 from cannon. The Swedish fired 7,464 shots from cannon and 394 from mortars. Both the first and second barrages had a similar number of shots fired, but the second barrage was a lot more devastating to the Swedish. This was due to several factors; the shots fired during the second bombardment used higher-caliber ammunition and did greater damage per round, and the rate of fire was much more intense. The first bombardment took a month, whereas the second only took six days.|$|E
