25|$|On 24 November Childers was {{executed}} by firing squad. Childers was the Republican head of propaganda {{and it was}} widely speculated that seven low-ranking Republicans were shot before Childers {{so that it would}} not <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been singled out to be executed.|$|E
500|$|Eight years later, Dr. B. Brookes Lee {{was arrested}} in Portland, Oregon. He {{had been accused of}} {{treating}} Sharkey to make it appear that he had been fouled by Fitzsimmons. Lee admitted it was true. [...] "I fixed Sharkey up to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been fouled. How? Well, that is something I do not care to reveal, but I will assert that it was doneâ€”that is enough. There is no doubt that Fitzsimmons was entitled to the decision and did not foul Sharkey. I got $1,000 for my part in the affair." ...|$|E
500|$|Showrunner and episode writer Steven Moffat {{wanted the}} episode to be [...] "big" [...] {{and say that}} [...] "we are turning {{it up to a}} level, we are really going mad with it". Atmospheric {{lighting}} was added by director of photography Stephan Pehrsson, who wanted to give it a movie feel. Moffat chose Stonehenge as the primary location for the episode because the monument was large and important enough to be suitable for the fall of someone as powerful as the Doctor. Filming was done at the real Stonehenge in Wiltshire on the night of 2 February 2010. The cast and crew had to abide by regulations; they were not allowed to touch the stones, bring heavy equipment in, and the lighting had to be done from the floor. They could only afford to shoot during one night and spent the only hour of daylight in the morning shooting a three-minute dialogue sequence. This proved to be a challenge, as it typically took {{an hour and a half}} to film similar scenes. The rest of the scenes set at Stonehenge were filmed with a lightweight replica set up in Margam Country Park called [...] "Foamhenge" [...] over four nights. Director Toby Haynes thought that they had [...] "established" [...] Stonehenge at the real site and now could get away with seeing less of it. The Doctor's speech to the alien spaceships was filmed 3 February, while Rory shooting Amy was shot on 4 February. The weather conditions were very cold with wind and rain which caused difficulties as it was hard to communicate over the wind. Haynes wanted the Doctor's speech to be his [...] "big, pop-star moment" [...] and to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was addressing a large site such as Wembley Stadium.|$|E

60|$|Rollo did not answer, but <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{were not}} convinced.|$|R
60|$|The quailing Leaf {{tried to}} <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had lived nowhere at all.|$|E

60|$|Creech <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had {{not heard}} aright. Bostil {{repeated}} the offer.|$|R

60|$|Eachin listened, with a <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would fain have {{believed}} {{the words of}} the comforter.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Dick--with {{rather a}} scared <b>look,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had {{forgotten}} it--returned a hasty {{answer in the}} affirmative.|$|E
60|$|It {{certainly}} <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had guessed correctly, and Jet {{drew his}} revolver.|$|R
60|$|The hotelkeeper {{pursed his}} lips and <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were solving a hard problem.|$|R
60|$|James {{shook his}} head. The {{midshipman}} <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had not understood the question.|$|R
60|$|He had no {{ground for}} imagining that Agatha {{would be willing}} to marry him; but if she were, it would <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> meant to share her riches when he offered his help. In fact, it would <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> meant to take {{advantage}} of her ignorance about mining matters and her trust. It would not disturb him if outsiders thought this, but she might come to think so.|$|E
60|$|Joe {{expressed}} his gratitude to Providence for this favourable dispensation, {{and tried to}} <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't wonder where Dolly was.|$|E
6000|$|... "He doesn't <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{belonged to}} this crowd," [...] was Dick's comment. [...] "He {{looks as if}} he might be a {{thorough}} gentleman." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{doctor was}} silent, {{and the old}} Director turned towards him his white-bearded, ruddy face, with a <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were groping in the dark.|$|E
6000|$|... "I never {{expected}} to hear that my nephew Bailey did anything so sensible as to take regular exercise. He does not <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'And {{so easily}} guarded,' replied Herries, with a <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would have {{penetrated}} my very thoughts,--'that, doubtless, you think horseback better calculated for an escape.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{assistant}} auctioneer {{came forward}} upon this. His face wore a troubled <b>look,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did not relish the duty {{he was called}} upon to perform.|$|E
