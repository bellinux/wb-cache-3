5|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{more quickly than}} the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be {{lower than that of}} the land, establishing a <b>land</b> <b>breeze,</b> as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it.|$|E
5|$|Rainbands spawned {{near and}} ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which {{are able to}} produce tornadoes. Rainbands {{associated}} with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front's orientation due {{to the formation of}} a low-level barrier jet. Bands of thunderstorms can form with sea breeze and <b>land</b> <b>breeze</b> boundaries, if enough moisture is present. If sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front, they can mask the location of the cold front itself.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, {{and may be}} preceded by squall lines and dry lines. Cold fronts are sharper surface boundaries with more significant horizontal wind shear than warm fronts. When a front becomes stationary, it can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind speed, known as a shear line, though the wind direction across the front normally remains constant. In the tropics, tropical waves move {{from east to west}} across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins. Directional and speed shear can occur across the axis of stronger tropical waves, as northerly winds precede the wave axis and southeast winds are seen behind the wave axis. Horizontal wind shear can also occur along local <b>land</b> <b>breeze</b> and sea breeze boundaries.|$|E

5|$|The {{diversion}} {{of the boats}} to Pompée prevented Saumarez from launching a planned amphibious assault against Isla Verda with the squadron's Marines, and in the fitful breeze, both Caesar and Audacious were beginning to drift dangerously close to the shoals around the island: if they grounded, then they would share Hannibals fate {{directly in front of}} the island's batteries. Observing the failure of his planned attack on the French squadron, Saumarez raised the signal at 13:35 for his ships to withdraw to Gibraltar. Pompée was already well on the way thanks to the towing boats, and Caesar and Audacious were able to cut their remaining anchors and limp out of the bay with the assistance of a sudden <b>land</b> <b>breeze</b> that carried them rapidly out of reach of the French and Spanish guns. They were joined by Venerable and Spencer as they left, the battered squadron retiring to Gibraltar leaving the almost dismasted hulk of Hannibal grounded in Algeciras harbour.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal was now {{isolated}} at {{the northern}} end of the British line, under heavy fire from Formidable as well as the Spanish shore batteries and gunboats and unable to manoeuvre or effectively respond. Ferris attempted to notify Saumarez of his ship's precarious position, but his signal halyards had been torn away by shot and it was sometime before assistance could be organised. The rest of the squadron was ordered to provide ship's boats to attempt to tow Hannibal off the shoal but the attempt failed, Caesars pinnace sinking in the process after being struck by a cannonball. Ultimately, Hannibal was left stranded as the last of the seabreeze disappeared, preventing any of the other British ships from coming to Ferris' assistance. There was however a light <b>land</b> <b>breeze</b> from the northwest that initially favoured the outnumbered and battered French squadron, Linois immediately ordering his ships to sever their anchor cables and use the breeze to manoeuvre slowly into stronger defensive positions closer inshore. His flagship Formidable successfully completed the manoeuvre, but neither Indomptable nor Desaix could be brought back under control in time, and both grounded, Desaix directly in front of Algeciras and Indomptable northeast of Isla Verda with her bow facing out to sea.|$|E
25|$|A lake moderates the {{surrounding}} region's temperature and climate because water {{has a very}} high specific heat capacity (4,186 J·kg−1·K−1). In the daytime a lake can cool the land beside it with local winds, resulting in a sea breeze; in the night it can warm it with a <b>land</b> <b>breeze.</b>|$|E

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2010. Includes bibliographical references. This study {{focuses on}} the diurnal {{variations}} of rainfall and winds over Malaysia. Data from 35 ground stations, combined with other remote-sensing products, are analyzed. Rainfall distribution has large spatial variations with higher rainfall on the windward side, especially during the winter northeast monsoon season. The timing {{of the season with}} heaviest rainfall occurs when the northeast monsoon has the largest impinging angle on the coastal mountain ranges. The driest season occurs during the southwest monsoon season, with low total precipitable water over the area, and when the monsoon trough is farthest to the north over the South China Sea. Land-sea breezes and/or upslope-downslope winds occur throughout the year for most areas. The timing of the diurnal rainfall maximum and horizontal rainfall distributions is closely related to terrain, local winds and the interaction of the diurnally driven winds with the prevailing flow. On the windward side, sea breezes/upslope winds combine with the prevailing flow resulting in a rainfall maximum during the late afternoon due to orographic lifting. On the leeside, sea breezes/upslope winds result in a secondary rainfall maximum during the late afternoon. The afternoon rainfall maximum mainly occurs near the foothills of the mountain ranges and propagates inland during the late afternoon/early evening. Over the northwest coast of East Malaysia, nocturnal rainfall is most significant during the late northeast monsoon season due to convergence of <b>land</b> <b>breezes</b> and the northeasterly monsoon flow. Throughout the year, convergence between <b>land</b> <b>breezes</b> and the prevailing flow or between <b>land</b> <b>breezes</b> {{from both sides of the}} coast within the strait results in nocturnal rainfall over the coastal areas. Over the east coast of West Malaysia, <b>land</b> <b>breezes</b> are evident, except during the early northeast monsoon season under strong northeasterlies (7 ~ 8 m s- 1). During the early northeast monsoon season, nocturnal rainfall is most significant due to the orographic blocking of the strong northeasterly monsoon flow. Flow deceleration of the incoming northeasterly monsoon flow is most significant in the early morning...|$|R
25|$|If the Santa Anas are strong, {{the usual}} day-time sea breeze may not arise, or develop weak {{later in the}} day because the strong {{offshore}} desert winds oppose the on-shore sea breeze. At night, the Santa Ana Winds merge with the <b>land</b> <b>breeze</b> blowing from land to sea and strengthen because the inland desert cools more than the ocean due to differences in the heat capacity and because there is no competing sea breeze.|$|E
25|$|The {{people of}} the coast, who are called Yligueynes, {{believed}} that the heaven and earth had no beginning {{and that there were}} two gods, one called Captan and the other Maguayen. They believed that the breeze and the sea were married; and that the <b>land</b> <b>breeze</b> brought forth a reed, which was planted by the god Captan. When the reed grew, it broke into two sections, from which came a man and a woman. To the man they gave the name Silalac, and that is the reason why men from that time on have been called lalac; the woman they named Sicavay, and henceforth women have been called babaye...|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} the tea season was {{during the early stages}} of the South-West monsoon in the China Sea, so head winds would be experienced, and very light or {{variable}} winds together with sudden squalls. Many captains sailing for the Sunda Strait therefore chose to head westward to the coast of Annam (present day Vietnam) to pick up land breezes. This involved tacking at the most favourable moment to be close inshore for the {{start of the}} <b>land</b> <b>breeze,</b> often in the middle of the night. Crossing to the Annam coast meant passing the Paracels, an area of low-lying islands and reefs which presented obvious dangers. From the coast of Annam, the usual route was to head south to the coast of Borneo, again to take advantage of land and sea breezes.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these winds, there is daily pattern of <b>land</b> <b>breezes</b> in the morning, followed by the onset of south-westerly sea breezes in the afternoon. This pattern is caused by temperature differences between {{the land and the}} ocean, and is not as strong in the Houtman Abrolhos as on the mainland, but is present nonetheless.|$|R
50|$|Frequent light north-westerly land breezes: When north-westerly <b>land</b> <b>breezes</b> are {{the strongest}} winds {{of the day}} they have a cooling effect on sea surface temperature.

25|$|In {{the opinion}} of the council it was deemed {{advisable}} to sail to Santo Domingo and to return to Florida in March of the following year. But Menéndez thought otherwise. His presence was already known to the enemy, four of his ships were so crippled by the gale that they could not make good time, and he believed that if the French should give chase to his fleet, they could outsail it. He concluded that it was better to attack at once, and, having beaten them, to return to St. Augustine and await reinforcements. His advice prevailed, so the Spaniards proceeded on their way. When within half a league of the French a thunderstorm passed over them, followed by a calm, and they were compelled to lie still until ten o'clock in the evening, then a <b>land</b> <b>breeze</b> sprang up, and they again got under way. Menéndez had given orders to approach the French ships bow to bow, and then to wait and board them at daybreak, for he feared they would set fire to their own vessels and thus endanger his, and would then escape to land in their rowboats.|$|E
500|$|During the afternoon, air {{pressure}} decreases {{over the land}} as the warmer air rises. The relatively cooler air over the sea rushes in to replace it. [...] The result is a relatively cool onshore wind. This process usually reverses at night where the water temperature is higher relative to the landmass, leading to an offshore <b>land</b> <b>breeze.</b> However, if water temperatures are colder than the land at night, the sea breeze may continue, only somewhat abated. This is typically the case along the California coast, for example.|$|E
500|$|The {{strength}} of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea. [...] If an off-shore wind of [...] exists, the sea breeze {{is not likely to}} develop. [...] At night, the land cools off more quickly than the ocean due to differences in their specific heat values, which forces the daytime sea breeze to dissipate.

50|$|Mountain and valley breezes form {{through a}} process similar to sea and <b>land</b> <b>breezes.</b> During the day, the sun heats up {{mountain}} air rapidly while valley remains relatively cooler. Convection causes it to rise, causing a valley breeze. At night, the process is reversed. During the night the slopes get cooled and the dense air descends into the valley as the mountain wind. These breezes occur mostly during calm and clear weather.|$|R

During the {{afternoon}} of the 21st we had an hour's fair wind, which soon changed into a heavy squall with rain, and my clumsy men let the mainsail get taken aback and nearly upset us, tearing the sail; and, what was worse, losing an hour's fair wind. The night was calm, and we made little progress.|$|R

On this day, the park breeze phenomenon was greatest at the intersection of <b>land</b> and sea <b>breezes,</b> and a slow air current intersected perpendicularly with {{the outer edge of the}} park towards an urban area within the whole park area. Although the park breeze phenomenon was observed even for sea and <b>land</b> <b>breezes</b> of only 1. 0 m/s, wind direction disorder of the park breeze might arise in response to the influence of wind, resulting in the lack of park breeze on the windward side...|$|R
500|$|Daytime {{heating and}} {{nighttime}} cooling of the hilly slopes lead to day to night {{variations in the}} airflow, similar {{to the relationship between}} sea breeze and <b>land</b> <b>breeze.</b> [...] At night, the sides of the hills cool through radiation of the heat. [...] The air along the hills becomes cooler and denser, blowing down into the valley, drawn by gravity. [...] This is known a katabatic wind or mountain breeze. [...] If the slopes are covered with ice and snow, the katabatic wind will blow during the day, carrying the cold dense air into the warmer, barren valleys. [...] The slopes of hills not covered by snow will be warmed during the day. The air that comes in contact with the warmed slopes becomes warmer and less dense and flows uphill. This is known as an anabatic wind or valley breeze.|$|E
500|$|Rainbands spawned {{near and}} ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which {{are able to}} produce tornadoes.

[...] Bands of thunderstorms can form with sea breeze and <b>land</b> <b>breeze</b> boundaries, if enough moisture is present. [...] If sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front, they can mask the location of the cold front itself. [...] Banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an extratropical cyclone can yield significant amounts of rain or snow. [...] Behind extratropical cyclones, rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the Great Lakes. [...] If the atmosphere is cold enough, these rainbands can yield heavy snow.|$|E
500|$|Convective rainbands {{can form}} {{parallel}} to terrain on its windward side, due to lee waves triggered by hills just upstream of the cloud's formation. [...] Their spacing is normally [...] to [...] apart. [...] When bands of precipitation near frontal zones approach steep topography, a low-level barrier jet stream forms parallel to and {{just prior to}} the mountain ridge, which slows down the frontal rainband {{just prior to the}} mountain barrier. If enough moisture is present, sea breeze and <b>land</b> <b>breeze</b> fronts can form convective rainbands. [...] Sea breeze front thunderstorm lines can become strong enough to mask the location of an approaching cold front by evening. [...] The edge of ocean currents can lead to the development of thunderstorm bands due to heat differential at this interface. [...] Downwind of islands, bands of showers and thunderstorms can develop due to low level wind convergence downwind of the island edges. [...] Offshore California, this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts.|$|E

500|$|Along the California coast, {{the cooler}} water {{sets up a}} surface marine layer that is much cooler than inland areas during the summer. [...] At the same time, the intense heating inland creates a {{pronounced}} thermal trough aligned with the Great Central Valley and typically linked to the broader thermal low across the North American deserts. [...] As a consequence, a strong pressure gradient is created which draws cool marine air landward. [...] As temperatures plummet, fog and stratus stream in and through the gaps of the Coast Ranges, and especially through the Golden Gate at San Francisco (see San Francisco fog). [...] The same thermal trough is sometimes pushed toward the coast, especially in late Fall as higher pressure develops to the east due to cooling further east.

2500|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{faster than the}} ocean due to {{differences}} in their heat capacity, which forces the dying of the daytime sea breeze as the temperature of the land approaches that of the ocean.

If there is sufficient moisture and instability available, the <b>land</b> <b>breeze</b> can cause showers, or even thunderstorms, over the water. Overnight thunderstorm development offshore due to the <b>land</b> <b>breeze</b> can be a good predictor for the activity on land the following day, {{as long as there are}} no expected changes to the weather pattern over the following 12–24 hours.
