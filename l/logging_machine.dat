But each type of <b>logging</b> <b>machine</b> has its shortcomings and therefore it is need to develop a combination of tracked and wheeled <b>logging</b> <b>machine.</b> This logging mechanism takes the form of tracked feet while preserving the flexibility of wheeled <b>logging</b> <b>machine,</b> and also it has the obstacle-crossing ability of tracked harvester. The most important indicator of the performance of this new <b>logging</b> <b>machine</b> is its trafficability in soft and uneven road. This thesis uses multi-body dynamic simulation analysis software RecurDyn to build up the 3 D model of such four feet tracked <b>logging</b> <b>machine,</b> and analyzes its dynamical process when meeting ditch.

A cross-sectional study was completed among Virginia loggers. Participants (n = 122) completed a self-administered questionnaire focusing on aspects of safety and health related to logging equipment.

Few (15. 6 %), however, perceived their jobs to be dangerous. Based on the opinions and suggestions of respondents, three priority areas were identified for interventions: struck-by/against hazards, situational awareness (SA) during logging operations, and visibility hazards. To address these hazards, and to have a broader and more substantial positive impact on safety and health, we discuss the need for proactive approaches such as incorporating proximity technologies in a <b>logging</b> <b>machine</b> or personal equipment, and enhancing <b>logging</b> <b>machine</b> design to enhance safety, ergonomics, and SA...|$|E

The ability of the machines to operate in the terrain was also good, even in rough terrain. These machines can also be used for other jobs, such as ditch digging, road building, and road maintenance. The machines then function more as carriers for attachments rather than custom-built backhoe loaders. By more careful planning of operations, the machines can be used to a higher degree and more effectively.

Protecting audit logs on a physically unprotected machine in hostile environments is a challenging task, especially in the presence of active adversaries. It is critical for such a system to have forward security and append-only properties such that when an adversary compromises a <b>logging</b> <b>machine,</b> she cannot forge or selectively delete the log entries accumulated before the compromise. Existing public-key-based secure logging schemes are computationally costly. Existing symmetric secure logging schemes are not publicly verifiable and open to certain attacks. In this article, we develop a new forward-secure and aggregate signature scheme called Blind-Aggregate-Forward (BAF), which is suitable for secure logging in resource-constrained systems. BAF is the only cryptographic secure logging scheme that can produce publicly verifiable, forward-secure and aggregate signatures with low computation, key/signature storage, and signature communication overheads for the loggers, without requiring any online trusted third party support. A simple variant of BAF also allows a fine-grained verification of log entries without compromising the security or computational efficiency of BAF.

The additional cost of these implements is very small, but they offer significant benefits when extracting timber under {{the conditions of}} small-scale forestry. The authors developed a productivity model for skidding timber with wheeled farm tractors, equipped with winch and sulky. The origin data pool contained over 300 individual skidding cycles, extracted from 8 separate tests. Statistical {{analysis of the data}} allowed calculating a simple mathematical relationship for estimating skidding productivity as a function of significant work conditions, such as: piece size, winching distance, tractor power, skidding distance and crew size. This model can provide useful directions to prospective users, contributing to operation planning, costing and optimization. It can predict {{a large proportion of the}} variability in the data and was successfully validated using reserved cycle records, extracted from the same data pool and not used for model development. Depending on tractor power and piece size, the average turn volume and productivity can exceed respectively 2 m 3 per cycle and 4 m 3 per Scheduled Machine Hour (SMH). Top performance can reach 8 m 3 SMH - 1, with heavy tractors and large logs. © 2011 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn...|$|E

SCA Forest supplies the Munksund sawmill with pine timber. Periodically the sawmill experiences problems related to bucking splits in their logs. The purpose {{of this study was to}} find an available method to measure the occurrence of splits directly on incoming timber. The ambition was also to gain some knowledge about possible variations between different logging crews in terms of split frequency.

The properties of inbound sawlogs are decisive for {{the output of}} sawn products {{and the cost of}} raw material contributes substantially to the cost of the final product. Increasing customer orientation and new demands from powerful customers in the building and retail sectors entail new or accentuated demands on management of procurement. Managing raw material procurement and communicating needs to suppliers and <b>logging</b> <b>machine</b> operators are vital issues for sawmills in order to be competitive. The purpose of the thesis is to explore how purchasing sawmills manage procurement of sawlogs. The results are based on 46 in-depth interviews with people involved in the procurement process at seven softwood sawmills in Denmark, Finland and Sweden. The thesis identifies various types of supply uncertainties as well as process improvement and buffer activities that reduce uncertainties. However, the major obstacle in the procurement process is the power/dependence balance in the relationships with suppliers. Beyond doubt, it restricts the manageability of procurement and particularly bucking. The results suggest {{that there are a number}} of ways to improve management of procurement, which are currently not fully employed. The thesis provides four key strategic dimensions of the procurement process and suggests a general conceptual model of wood procurement to purchasing sawmills.

The importance of the identified strategic dimensions of the procurement process needs to be quantified in order to provide normative suggestions...|$|E

As a consequence of this, it is important that self-protecting systems have {{the ability to}} completely and automatically roll back malicious activity which has occurred. As the cost of human resources currently dominates the cost of CPU, network, and storage resources, we contend that computing systems should be built with automated analysis and recovery as a primary goal.

40|$|This study {{examined}} methods for increasing seatbelt usage in {{one type of}} heavy <b>logging</b> <b>machine</b> (the skidder). This machine is used extensively for extracting felled trees and transporting them from where they are cut down to a central processing area. Preliminary investigations suggested that the operators of these machines failed to wear their seatbelts because they were poorly designed and because the operators simply forgot. A survey {{of the literature on}} increasing safety behaviours found that the two most powerful techniques were behaviour modification and human factors engineering (or ergonomics). Therefore, these were the two techniques used here. The standard seatbelts were redesigned to make them easier to use and an orange flashing reminder light was installed into the machines of seven full-time skidder operators. These machines were operating in either Kaingaroa, Rotoehu, Tahorakuri or Te Whakao Forests in the central North Island of New Zealand. The experiment used a multiple baseline single subject design, with the subjects receiving each treatment twice. With the installation of the redesigned seatbelt, mean seatbelt usage for six subjects rose from 21 % to 31 %. One subject refused to wear a seatbelt throughout the experiment. Installing the reminder light increased seatbelt usage by a further 1 %. Removing the new seatbelt design caused usage to drop 16 %. A further decrease of 5 % occurred with the return to baseline phase when the reminder light had also been removed. The second introduction of the new seatbelt resulted in an increase in usage from 10 % to a mean level of 46 %. This was increased a further 22 % with the reintroduction of the reminder light. The results showed that an easier to use seatbelt in combination with a reminder light can increase the level of seatbelt usage. The results also provide further evidence of the power of both behaviour modification techniques and human factors engineering in the field of occupational safety...|$|E

Vilenus [18] applied trajectory {{sensitivity analysis}} to the valve-controlled cylinder system of the <b>logging</b> <b>machine</b> and the mathematical model of this system was simplified to fifth order model where the servo valve flow-pressure nonlinearity and dead zone nonlinearity were taken into consideration. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of ten main parameters containing viscous damping coefficient, conversion mass, internal leakage coefficient of servo cylinder, effective piston area of servo cylinder, effective bulk modulus, servo valve gain, nature frequency of servo valve, damping ratio of servo valve, conversion coefficient and system supply oil pressure is obtained with parameters change 1 % under single working condition. The sensitivity analysis {{results indicated that the}} sensitivity of piston rod area of the servo cylinder, servo valve gain, conversion flow coefficient and system supply oil pressure is large and that of viscous damping coefficient, internal leakage coefficient of the servo valve, damping ratio of servo vale and nature frequency of the servo valve is relatively small under the same working condition. Furthermore, Farasat et al. [19] founded the fourth order linear mathematical model of the valve-controlled cylinder position control system where the servo valve flow-pressure nonlinearity is linearized partially. The sensitivity of other parameters, such as servo valve torque motor constant, servo valve area constant, orifice opening of metering valve, system return oil pressure, supply oil volume, return oil volume and input signal voltage, is given with parameters change 1 % under single working condition by four sensitivity evaluation methods including VILENUS method, revised VILENUS method, Entirety index method and Individual characteristics method. The analysis results indicated that the sensitivity of effective piston area of servo cylinder, flow coefficient, conversion mass and input signal voltage is relatively small. Kong et al. [20 – 22] first established the fifth linear order mathematical model for the hydraulic drive unit of quadruped robot and derived the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis. Aimed at the imprecise conclusion of sensitivity analysis obtained from the linear model, some nonlinear models are also established. Besides, the sensitivity mathematical expressions with nonlinear and time-varied parameters are derived under the trotting gait working conditions. Kong et al. [23] derived the mathematical model of the second order trajectory sensitivity analysis based on the mathematical model of the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis. Therefore, the situation where the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis accuracy of some parameters is not high is improved. Then the experimental verification is conducted.|$|E

In an attempt to weigh the benefits of tillage against possible damage done to residual trees during tillage, a study was set up to look at both immediate and long-term effects of various treatments in a second-growth Douglas-fir thinning. Designated skid trails were laid out 46 m apart prior to ground-based logging with a rubber-tired skidder and a small crawler iractor. Pre-logging analysis consisted of penetrometer transects used to obtain a general indication of soil strength; during <b>logging,</b> <b>machine</b> movements along trails and turn characteristics were recorded. After logging, four of seven trails were tilled and approximately 40 trees were selected as study trees in each of three populations: (1) trees near untilled trails, (2) trees near tilled trails, and (3) trees away from any trails (control). Bulk density changes were measured in soil near trees in each population using a dual probe nuclear densimeter. In addition, tree and site characteristics, root and stem damage from logging and adjacent competition were recorded for each tree. Untilled irails showed average increases in soil bulk density over control of 17. 8 and 11. 2 percent for 10. 2 - and 20. 3 -cm depths, respectively, but a decrease of 2. 7 percent at the 30. 5 -cm depth. Tilled trail average bulk density showed a difference of 6. 1 percent greater than control at 10. 2 cm and 2. 2 and 3. 6 percent less than control for 20. 3 cm and 30. 5 cm, respectively. Stepwise multiple regression used to explore associations between slope, number of vehicle turns, cumulative ground pressure, slash characteristics on trails, and interactions of all these variables showed no significant associations with bulk density changes due to logging. Analysis of Variance did reveal greater mean bulk densities at the 10. 2 - and 20. 3 -cm depths near trees on untilled Irails where slash did not exist as compared to where slash did exist. Root damage due to tillage was assigned to low, moderate or high damage classes based on length and diameter of roots exposed above ground after tillage. Ana[ysis by regression showed that these root damage classes had significantly different tree diameters, revealing a possible trend of higher root damage for larger trees along trails being tilled. A rough economic ana[ysis estimated tillage for this project cost the Bureau of Land Management approximately 600 /mile or 400 /acre of tilled trail area. These figures are unusually high due to several factors including the small amount of work done for high move-in costs, complications brought on by research demands, and operator inexperience...|$|E

Much progress has been made in the preparation of the experimental set-up for testing Polyox drag reduction in CLP in the 8 -inch-diameter test loop. The Polyox dissolution/injection tank has been built and tested. Test procedures for injecting and measuring Polyox concentration have been developed. Fluorescent dye (Rhodamine B) are being tested for possible use to determine Polyox concentration in water (Gangwei Wu under Dr. John Miles). 11. Hydrodynamic equations have been derived to determine the behavior of capsule trains entering and leaving a slope. A commercially available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program (FLUENT) was used to determine the pressure field around a capsule in the turbulent regime (Xiang Gao under Dr. Henry Liu). 12. Five different biomass materials (sawdust, wood chips, alfalfa, soy bean hulls and cottonseeds) were compacted successfully into logs (1. 94 -inch-diameter solid cylinders) at room temperature without use of binder. Compaction ratios of these materials range from 2 to 8. The result looks promising (Chris Yates under Dr. Tom Marrero. Future Research (Plan for Next Quarter) : 1. Complete construction of the coal <b>log</b> <b>machine</b> by Gundlach Company, installation of the machine in Columbia, and preliminary testing [...] debugging (Gundlach Company). 2. Completion of the metal building to house the coal <b>log</b> <b>machine</b> (Campus Facilities. 3. Complete preliminary tests to check the equations for predicting coal log compaction, and revising of equations if needed (Dr. Liu/Gao). 4. Conduct a set of more detailed tests on the effect of water temperature on coal log wear and breakage in pipe (Dr. Liuffao). 5. Conduct rapid compaction test (3 -second compaction time) by using the new 1. 9 -inch mold and the new alignment fixture (Dr. Gunnink/Li). 6. Compare small log wear (in Columbia) with large log wear (in Rolla) using logs made under similar conditions except for the size of the mold (Dr. Wilson/Zhao) 7. Complete design of the Pilot Plant pipeline system (Dr. Lenau). 8. Complete design and selection of the sensors and automatic control system for operating the pilot plant pipeline system automatically (Dr. Nair/Du). 9. Make resin logs for drag reduction study in 8 -inch-diameter pipeline. Conduct drag reduction tests with Polyox, capsules but without fiber (Dr. Miles/Wu). 10. Complete CFD study of stationary capsule (comparing FLUENT results with Liu and Graze's 1980 measurements) (Dr. Liu/Dr. Miles/Gao). 11. Continue biomass with an estimate of the compaction cost (Dr. Marrero/Yates).

40|$|A radical, new {{innovation}} {{with regards}} to forestry machines is {{the design of a}} cab suspended from an arched column connected to a swiveling socket. The purpose of the design is to reduce the amountofskewedandtwistedworkpostures,which are often frequent among operators of <b>logging</b> <b>machines.</b> The ability to sit straight is whatmost operators point {{out to be the most}} desirable feature of the self-leveling and swiveling cab. The low noise level is also appreciated, as is the ability to swivel the cab around on its vertical axis. The swiveling ability of the cab gives better visibility and also helps reduce the amount of head rotations. Furthermore, jarring motions and extreme swing due to uneven terrain are much less bothersome than in a conventional cab design. Vibration levels at the operator's seat in the self-leveling cab are equal to those measured in conventional rigid cabs. This new cab design provides comfort to the operator and improves the operator's ability to work at a sustained [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{recent and}} coming {{development}} of forestry practices in Northwest Russia includes fast implementation of cut-to-length (CTL) harvesting, transfer of technology, introduction of commercial thinnings and energy wood harvesting. The market size for industrial and energy wood harvesting machinery was assessed for the Leningrad region. The <b>logging</b> <b>machines</b> fleet consisted of about 700 machines for traditional tree-length technology and 120 harvesters and forwarders for CTL technology. The domestic machinery fleet is obsolete; manufacture of domestic forest machinery has dropped in both quantity and models, and thus imported CTL machinery is replacing domestic tree-length machinery. The {{results indicate that}} the market for CTL machinery could be 21 harvesters, 32 forwarders and 26 short-wood trucks per year and could increase to up to 30 – 40 machines each in the future. The maximum need for the machinery in the Leningrad region could be 50 – 60 harvesters, forwarders and short-wood trucks per year if allowable cut and commercial thinnings were realized in full scale. The market for energy wood harvesting machinery could be 4 biomass forwarders, 11 mobile chippers and 13 wood chip trucks per year and could be 6 and 15 – 20 machines per year in the future, respectively. The maximum need could be 30 – 40 biomass forwarders, mobile chippers and wood chip trucks per year. Only one third of the logging enterprises in the region had enough leased forest resources for applying the highly productive mechanized CTL technology. These 41 forest enterprises would need 270 machines, consisting of 90 harvesters, 100 forwarders and 80 short-wood trucks. Thirty-seven enterprises would need about 50 biomass forwarders and chippers and 60 wood chip trucks for energy wood harvesting. Sixty percent of the forest leasers had enough forest resources and could be users of Nordic CTL technology if allowable cut was utilized completely and if commercial thinnings were done in full scale. These 68 enterprises would need about 500 conventional <b>logging</b> <b>machines,</b> consisting of 160 harvesters, 190 forwarders and 150 short-wood trucks, and about 300 energy wood harvesting machines, consisting of 100 biomass forwarders, 100 chippers, and 110 wood chip trucks. In addition, the ten largest enterprises would need half of the total fleet...|$|R
