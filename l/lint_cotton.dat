40|$|Tribolium castaneum Herbst (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) is {{a common}} stored grain pest for which {{a wide range of}} {{suitable}} resources has been recorded. These beetles are facultatively fungivorous and their resource range may extend to fungi associated with non-grain resources (e. g. cotton seed) and other decaying plant matter. Little is known with respect to fungi in terms of resource location by these beetles in the field. We, therefore, conducted a series of experiments in laboratory arenas, glasshouse cages and the field to determine how beetles respond to grain resources in relation to cotton seed (together with its lint stubble and associated fungal flora). Results from the tests conducted in relatively small arenas and cages in the laboratory and glasshouse reveal that the responses of T. castaneum adults to food resources were twice as strong when walking as when flying (as measured by the proportion of the released beetles that were trapped). Also, a clear preference for <b>linted</b> <b>cotton</b> seeds was evident in walking T. castaneum, especially in small-scale arenas in the laboratory, where at least 60 % of beetles released preferred <b>linted</b> <b>cotton</b> seeds over wheat and sorghum. Similarly, in cages (1 m 3) they responded five times more strongly to <b>linted</b> <b>cotton</b> seed than to conventional grain resources. However, this pattern was not consistent with those obtained from field trapping over 20 m and the beetles did not show any particular preference to any of the resources tested above. Our results suggest a focus on walking beetles in trapping studies for population estimations and, for developing effective food-based trapping lures, the potential use of active volatiles from the fungi associated with <b>linted</b> <b>cotton</b> seed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

The experiment was carried out in a strip plot design with four replications. The vertical plots were occupied with three sowing dates. The horizontal plots were assigned to three ridge width.

Most of the cotton ginning operations are performed by using double roller (DR) ginning machines which serve {{an important role in the}} cotton ginning industries. The rollers used in these industries are made of Chrome Composite Leather-Cladding (CCLC) covering fixed to a shaft. The CCLC coverings contain about 18 000 to 36 000 mg/kg (ppm) as total chromium of trivalent and hexavalent forms which are toxic and carcinogenic to human health. When the seed-cotton is processed in DR ginning machines, the <b>lint</b> <b>cotton</b> is contaminated with chromium of about 140 to 1990 ppm as against the safety limits of 0. 1 ppm. During the cotton ginning process due to persistent rubbing of leather over stationary knife the chromium particles are carried into <b>lint</b> <b>cotton</b> such that the spun yarns and cotton by-products contain about 100 to 200 ppm, which according to world environmental standards should not be more than 0. 1 ppm.

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the main}} hurdles {{standing}} in the way of optimal cleaning of <b>cotton</b> <b>lint</b> is the lack of sensing systems that can react fast enough to provide the control system with real-time information as to the level of trash contamination of the <b>cotton</b> <b>lint.</b> This research examines the use of programmable graphic processing units (GPU) as an alternative to the PC’s traditional use of the central processing unit (CPU). The use of the GPU, as an alternative computation platform, allowed for the machine vision system to gain a significant improvement in processing time. By improving the processing time, this research seeks to address the lack of availability of rapid trash sensing systems and thus alleviate a situation in which the current systems view the <b>cotton</b> <b>lint</b> either well before, or after, the cotton is cleaned. This extended lag/lead time that is currently imposed on the cotton trash cleaning control systems, is what is responsible for system operators utilizing a very large dead-band safety buffer in order to ensure that the <b>cotton</b> <b>lint</b> is not undercleaned. Unfortunately, the utilization of a large dead-band buffer results in the majority of the <b>cotton</b> <b>lint</b> being over-cleaned which in turn causes lint fiber-damage as well as significant losses of the valuable lint due to the excessive use of cleaning machinery.

We evaluated the relative attraction of T. castaneum and R. dominica to wheat, sorghum and cotton {{seeds in the}} field, near grain storage facilities and well away from storages in southern and central Queensland using multiple trapping techniques. The results show that T. castaneum is more strongly attracted to <b>linted</b> <b>cotton</b> seed relative to wheat, whereas R. dominica {{did not respond to}} cotton seed at all and was attracted only to wheat. Significantly more adults of T. castaneum (10 - 15 times) were attracted to traps placed on the ground, near grain storage, than to equivalent traps that were suspended (1. 5 m above the ground) nearby. These results suggest that Tribolium beetles detect and respond to resources towards the end of their dispersal flight, after which they localize resources while walking. By contrast R. dominica was captured only in suspended traps, which suggests they fly directly onto resources as they localize them. The ability of both species to colonize and reproduce in isolated resource patches within the relatively short time of 1 month is illustrated by the returns from the traps deployed in the field (at least 1 km from the nearest stored grain) even though they caught only a few beetles. The results presented here provide novel insights about the resource location behaviours of both T. castaneum and R. dominica. In particular, the relationship of T. castaneum with non-cereal resources that are not conventionally associated with this species suggests an emphasis on these other resources in investigating the resource location behaviour of these beetles.

The cotton roller ginning process is the mechanical separation of cotton fibres from their seeds by means of one or more rollers to which fibres adhere while the seeds are impeded and struck off or pulled loose. Most of the cotton ginning operations are done using roller gins. The roller coverings contain about 18000 to 30000 mg/kg (ppm) as total chromium of trivalent and hexavalent forms which are toxic on human health. When the seed-cotton is ginned, the ginned <b>lint</b> <b>cotton</b> adsorbs with it about 140 to 1990 mg/kg (ppm) as total chromium of trivalent and hexavalent forms.
