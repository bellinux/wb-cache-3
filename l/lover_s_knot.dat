40|$|This paper {{analyses}} Shakespeare's {{treatment of}} love from the theoretical {{vantage point of}} Roland Barthes's entry on "gossip" in A <b>Lover.</b> <b>s</b> Discourse: Fragments. According to Barthes, love narratives are the effect of "gossip" third person counterfeits of a discourse of desire that in its purest form can only be addressed by a first to a second person. As the pronoun of gossip, the third person is the "wicked pronoun". Shakespearean drama displays the dialectics of <b>lover.</b> <b>s</b> discourse and love story, the contrast between a discourse of desire and a discourse about others, desires. This contrast is registered in the transformation of a referential universe which exhausts itself in "I" and "you" (the lover's) into forms of discourse where the lover becomes "he" or "she", a "theme" rather than the subject of desire. Shakespeare constructs a heroics of love whose main feature is the lovers, resistance to be narrated by others. But this resistance usually {{ends up in the}} lovers, final yielding to third-person narratives, sometimes told by others, sometimes by themselves. The analysis of pronominal forms in Twelfth Night (1601), Troilus and Cressida (1602), and Anthony and Cleopatra (1607) constitutes the basis for a wider concern with the effects of third-person narratives upon the shaping of erotic identity in these plays...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{view of the}} self-linking invariant, {{the number}} |K | of framed <b>knots</b> in <b>S</b> 3 with given {{underlying}} knot K is infinite. In fact, the second author previously defined affine self-linking invariants and used them to show that |K| is infinite for every knot in an orientable manifold unless the manifold contains a connected sum factor of S 1 × <b>S</b> 2; the <b>knot</b> K need not be zero-homologous and the manifold {{is not required to}} be compact. We show that when M is orientable, the number |K | is infinite unless K intersects a non-separating sphere at exactly one point, in which case |K | = 2; the existence of a non-separating sphere implies that M contains a connected sum factor of S 1 × <b>S</b> 2. For <b>knots</b> in nonorientable manifolds we show that if |K | is finite, then K is disorienting, or there is an isotopy from the knot to itself which changes the orientation of its normal bundle, or it intersects some embedded S 2 or RP 2 at exactly one point, or it intersects some embedded S 2 at exactly two points {{in such a way that}} a closed curve consisting of an arc in K between the intersection points and an arc in S 2 is disorienting...|$|R
40|$|The WFPC 2 of the HST {{has been}} used to obtain {{high-resolution}} images of NGC 4038 / 4039 that go roughly 3 magnitudes deeper in V than previous observations made during Cycle 2 (- 14 < M_V < - 6). To first order the luminosity function (LF) is a power law, with exponent α = - 2. 12 +/- 0. 04. However, after decoupling the cluster and stellar LFs, which overlap in the range - 9 < M_V < - 6, we find an apparent bend in the young cluster LF at approximately M_V = - 10. 4. The LF has a power law exponent - 2. 6 +/- 0. 2 in the brightward and - 1. 7 +/- 0. 2 in the faintward. The bend corresponds to a mass 10 ^ 5 M_, only slightly lower than the characteristic mass of globular clusters in the Milky Way (2 x 10 ^ 5 M_). The star clusters of the Antennae appear slightly resolved, with median effective radii of 4 +/- 1 pc, similar to or perhaps slightly larger than those of globular clusters in our Galaxy. However, the radial extents of some of the very young clusters (ages < 10 Myr) are much larger than those of old globular clusters. A combination of the UBVI colors, morphology, and GHRS spectra enables us to age-date the clusters in different regions of The Antennae. We find two groups of young star clusters with ages < 20 Myr and 100 Myr, as well as an intermediate-age group (500 Myr) and a handful of old globular clusters from the progenitor galaxies. Age estimates derived from GHRS spectroscopy yield 3 +/- 1 Myr for Knot K (just south of the nucleus of NGC 4038) and 7 +/- 1 Myr for <b>Knot</b> <b>S</b> in the Western Loop, in good agreement with ages derived from the UBVI colors. Effective gas-outflow velocities from <b>Knots</b> <b>S</b> and K are estimated to be about 25 - 30 km/s.
