40|$|The {{changes of}} the European {{regulatory}} space propose new questions concerning the identity and the liability of regulators. The increasing use of self-regulation, co-regulation and delegated self-regulation in different fields have empowered private regulators. They have been playing an increasing strategic role in defining the features of market regulation and integration at European and national level. To ensure effectiveness and accountability of these regulatory strategies a European coordinated regime of conflict of interest and liability becomes crucial. This essay focuses on liability of private regulators for (1) failure to regulate or (2) failure to control regulatees’ compliance and for defective regulation and control. A set of principles concerning liability of private regulators should be tailored, paying attention to field specificity. The analysis suggests {{that there should be}} a significant difference between <b>liability</b> <b>regimes</b> concerning pure private regulators and those related to private regulators acting within a coordinated framework of co-regulation and delegated self-regulation. Furthermore it is claimed that a stronger correlation between models of regulation (i. e command and control, responsive regulation, market incentives) and models of liability is needed while today’s national legal systems mainly associate <b>liability</b> <b>regimes</b> to the organizational model of the private regulator (association, foundation, company, consortium etc.). The design of <b>liability</b> <b>regimes</b> for private regulator should combine the regulatory model and the governance structure so as to guarantee compliance of regulations and accountability towards third parties. The article concludes with a research agenda concerning the blurring relationship between standard setting and monitoring and its influence on the liability aspectsmregulation; governance; judicial review...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs {{the private}} sector and {{government}} begin to spend billions of dollars to research and deploy carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, the question of legal liability for managing short-term and long-term environmental, health and safety risks must be addressed. We examine potential CCS liability within a U. S. context and survey the existing environmental and tort law <b>liability</b> <b>regimes</b> that may affect CCS. We conclude that while existing <b>liability</b> <b>regimes</b> are insufficient on their own to govern the CCS industry, they could provide important risk management tools and serve as safeguards to private parties and governments in the event of harm. We also propose a model for long term stewardship, blending including bonding, insurance, and pooled federal funding into commercial CCS project management to better provide financial security to investors without destroying existing liability protections for those who may suffer harm from CCS. This proposal offers a starting point to develop a model to integrate liability for the nascent CCS industry. A longer version of this paper {{can be found in the}} Emory Law Review, Fall 2008...|$|R

40|$|In the {{traditional}} {{model of the}} law and economics of torts, harm accrues proportional to use. This has the remarkable implication for products-generated torts that product performance concerns (e. g., issues of care and of liability for harm) can be considered independently of market performance concerns (e. g., market structure and competition). Moreover, the classical analysis finds that all <b>liability</b> <b>regimes</b> (strict <b>liability,</b> no liability, and negligence based on the socially-efficient due care standard) yield the same choice of care by the firm in the unilateral care tort model. We modify the standard model to allow for cumulative harm (that is, the per-unit expected harm is increasing in the level of use); examples from pharmaceuticals, environmental risks, privacy, food products, and mechanical systems are provided. We show that, when expected harm is cumulative, the separation between the level of care and the level of output does not occur. We further show that the different possible <b>liability</b> <b>regimes</b> now produce different outcomes and yield different implications for social efficiency. This implies an interaction between law concerned with liability and law concerned with market performance. Since these generally governmental (and private law) responsibilities are divided among relevant agencies and institutions, and are the subjects of different bodies of law, this presents a challenge to the correct design of rules for agents in the economy. We argue for selection among alternative <b>liability</b> <b>regimes</b> based upon what we refer to as ï¿½resilience:ï¿½ a resilient policy is robust to the incentives for agents to undermine it and flexible with respect to outside influences (e. g., from antitrust authorities or regulators). Strict liability is a resilient policy; no liability and negligence are not resilient. Thus, we provide a new argument for strict liability with respect to product-generated harms.

50|$|In law, strict {{liability}} {{is a standard}} for liability which may exist in either a criminal or civil context. A rule specifying {{strict liability}} makes a person legally responsible for the damage and loss caused by his/her acts and omissions regardless of culpability (including fault in criminal law terms, typically the presence of mens rea). Under strict liability, there is no requirement to prove fault, negligence or intention. Strict liability is prominent in tort law (especially product liability), corporations law, and criminal law.

50|$|Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad {{also argued}} that a strict <b>liability</b> <b>regime</b> would {{encourage}} manufacturers not to ship hazardous materials through densely populated cities and instead choose alternate routes. The court rejected this argument {{on the grounds that}} given the US railway system's hub and spoke design, it was difficult for shippers to avoid shipping their goods through densely populated neighborhoods, because the hubs of this system are all located in large cities. The court said that Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad had failed to demonstrate that the shipment of acrylonitrile by rail through populated areas is so hazardous an activity that even when shippers exercise due care, the law should nevertheless create incentives to relocate the activity to nonpopulated areas or to reduce the scale of the activity.|$|E
5000|$|Turning {{from these}} general {{principles}} to the case, Posner states that [...] "we {{have been given}} no reason...for believing that a negligence regime is not perfectly adequate to remedy and deter, at reasonable cost, the accidental spillage of acrylonitrile from rail cars." [...] Instead, the court says that under {{the facts of this}} case, the chemical spill was caused by the negligence of either (a) the North American Car Corporation in failing to maintain or inspect the rail car properly; (b) American Cyanamid in failing to maintain or inspect the car; or (c) the Missouri Pacific Railroad when it had custody of the rail car. [...] Under a negligence regime, the role of the courts is to consider the evidence and reach a determination as to which party's negligence caused the spill, and the negligent party would then have to pay the cleanup costs. Under a strict <b>liability</b> <b>regime,</b> American Cyanamid would have to pay the cleanup costs, even if it did not act negligently, and the court is not convinced that there are compelling reasons to force American Cyanamid to bear the cleanup costs if it was not negligent.|$|E

40|$|The law of {{environmental}} liability {{has already been}} the object of several comparative endeavours. This article seeks to bring a different perspective to the debate, by examining selected developments in the field {{through the lens of}} the emerging global environmental law scholarship. It brings the comparative method of analysis into a multi-level context with a view to identifying the emergence of common legal responses to the problem of liability and reparation for environmental harm across different jurisdictions and regulatory levels. The analysis will focus on a ‘novel’ set {{of environmental}} <b>liability</b> <b>regimes,</b> which specifically address damage to the environment and to natural resources, as distinct from more traditional categories of damage to property and other individual rights arising as a consequence of environmental pollution. These include: the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and the Oil Pollution Act, which constitute a pioneering attempt to envisage a public law-oriented system of liability and restoration for damage to natural resources; the European Union Environmental Liability Directive; and selected, recent international treaty developments.

5000|$|Tort victims {{differ from}} {{commercial}} creditors {{because they have}} no ability to contract around limited liability, and are therefore regarded differently under most state laws. The theory developed in the mid-20th century that beyond the corporation itself, it was more appropriate for the law to recognize the economic [...] "enterprise", which usually composes groups of corporations, where the parent takes the benefit of a subsidiary's activities and is capable of exercising decisive influence. A concept of [...] "enterprise liability" [...] was developed in fields such tax law, accounting practices, and antitrust law that were gradually received into the courts' jurisprudence. Older cases had suggested that there was no special right to pierce the veil in favor of tort victims, even where pedestrians had been hit by a tram owned by a bankrupt-subsidiary corporation, or by taxi-cabs that were owned by undercapitalized subsidiary corporations. More modern authority suggested a different approach. In a case concerning one of the worst oil spills in history, caused by the Amoco Cadiz which was owned through subsidiaries of the Amoco Corporation, the Illinois court that heard the case stated that the parent corporation was liable by the fact of its group structure. The courts therefore [...] "usually apply more stringent standards to piercing the corporate veil in a contract case than they do in tort cases" [...] because tort claimants do not voluntarily accept limited liability. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the US Supreme Court in United States v Bestfoods held if a parent corporation [...] "actively participated in, and exercised control over, the operations of" [...] a subsidiary's facilities it [...] "may be held directly liable". This leaves the question {{of the nature of the}} common law, in absence of a specific statute, or where a state law forbids piercing the veil except on very limited grounds. One possibility is that tort victims go uncompensated, even while a parent corporation is solvent and has insurance. A second possibility is that a compromise <b>liability</b> <b>regime,</b> such as pro rata rather than joint and several liability is imposed across all shareholders regardless of size. A third possibility, and one that does not interfere with the basics of corporate law, is that a direct duty of care could be owed in tort to the injured person by parent corporations and major shareholders to the extent they could exercise control. This route means corporate enterprise would not gain a subsidy at the expense of other people's health and environment, and that there is no need to pierce the veil.|$|E
