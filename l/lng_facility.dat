2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the September 11, 2001 attacks, there have been {{concerns}} about the security of LNG shipments within Boston Harbor, and increased fear of terrorism. Because of the location of the LNG terminal in the Mystic River, tankers traveling to and from the facility are forced to pass directly offshore of downtown Boston. During their voyage through the harbor, they are protected by a security zone that extends [...] in front of the vessel, [...] behind it, and more than half a mile on either side. This zone is enforced by escort vessels provided by the Coast Guard and State Police. The Tobin Bridge is closed as the escort passes under it, and boating is forbidden within the security zone. , there have been proposals to construct an offshore <b>LNG</b> <b>facility</b> on either Outer Brewster Island in the Harbor, or further a field in the wider Massachusetts Bay.|$|E

40|$|These {{guidelines}} {{were developed to}} assist applicants in addressing the seismic design requirements for proposed liquefied natural gas (<b>LNG)</b> <b>facilities.</b> They apply to all new <b>LNG</b> <b>facilities</b> or proposed significant changes to existing <b>LNG</b> <b>facilities</b> {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). This document replaces and supersedes “Data Requirements for the Seismic Review of <b>LNG</b> <b>Facilities,</b> NBSIR 84 - 2833 ” (18 CFR 380. 12 (h) (5) and (o) (15)). Federal regulations applicable to seismic design of <b>LNG</b> <b>facilities</b> are identified and summarized, and guidance is provided in a number of areas that may be subject to interpretation by technical experts. In general, the guidelines are based on existing rules and procedures found in NFPA 59 A, ASCE 7 - 05, ASCE 4 - 98, API 650 Appendix E and other current standards documents applicable to <b>LNG</b> <b>facilities.</b> The guidelines also rely on the National Seismic Hazard Maps and the 2006 IBC MCE Ground Motion Maps, which were developed specifically for use in the design of buildings and other structures in the United States by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

25|$|<b>LNG</b> <b>facilities</b> provide {{delivery}} capacity during peak periods when market demand exceeds pipeline deliverability. LNG storage tanks possess {{a number of}} advantages over underground storage. As a liquid at approximately −163°C (−260°F), it occupies about 600 times less space than gas stored underground, and it provides high deliverability at very short notice because <b>LNG</b> storage <b>facilities</b> are generally located close to market and can be trucked to some customers avoiding pipeline tolls. There is no requirement for cushion gas and it allows access to a global supply. <b>LNG</b> <b>facilities</b> are, however, more expensive to build and maintain than developing new underground storage facilities.|$|R

25|$|LNG is most cost {{efficiently}} {{produced in}} relatively large facilities due to economies of scale, at sites with marine access allowing regular large bulk shipments direct to market. This requires a secure gas supply of sufficient capacity. Ideally, facilities are located {{close to the}} gas source, to minimize the cost of intermediate transport infrastructure and gas shrinkage (fuel loss in transport). The high cost of building large <b>LNG</b> <b>facilities</b> makes the progressive development of gas sources to maximize facility utilization essential, and the life extension of existing, financially depreciated <b>LNG</b> <b>facilities</b> cost effective. Particularly when combined with lower sale prices due to large installed capacity and rising construction costs, this makes the economic screening/ justification to develop new, and especially greenfield, <b>LNG</b> <b>facilities</b> challenging, even if these could be more environmentally friendly than existing facilities with all stakeholder concerns satisfied. Due to high financial risk, it is usual to contractually secure gas supply/ concessions and gas sales for extended periods before proceeding to an investment decision.|$|R
