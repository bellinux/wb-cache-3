25|$|A debate {{took place}} at the 37th <b>Lunar</b> <b>and</b> <b>Planetary</b> Science Conference in March 2006 in Houston, Texas over the {{postulate}} that carbon-rich content within the pores of the rocks consisted of the remains of living matter.

A team concluded in 2014 that although the abiotic scenario is considered to be the most reasonable explanation for the shapes in this meteorite, it is evident that the Martian subsurface contains niche environments where life could develop.|$|E

These radionuclides, like aluminium-26 and iron-60, have short half-lives and would produce interior heating relatively quickly. Without the short-lived variety, Enceladus's complement of long-lived radionuclides would not have been enough to prevent rapid freezing of the interior, even with Enceladus's comparatively high rock–mass fraction, given its small size. Given Enceladus's relatively high rock–mass fraction, the proposed enhancement in 26Al and 60Fe would result in a differentiated body, with an icy mantle and a rocky core. Subsequent radioactive and tidal heating would raise the temperature of the core to 1,000 K, enough to melt the inner mantle. However, for Enceladus to still be active, part of the core must have also melted, forming magma chambers that would flex under the strain of Saturn's tides. Tidal heating, such as from the resonance with Dione or from libration, would then have sustained these hot spots in the core and would power the current geological activity.

By repositioning {{two of the}} five THEMIS probes (P 1 and P 2) in coordinated, lunar equatorial orbits, at dis-tances of ∼ 55 – 65 RE geocentric (∼ 1. 1 – 12 RL selenocentric), ARTEMIS will perform the first systematic, two-point observations of the distant magnetotail, the solar wind, <b>and</b> the <b>lunar</b> space <b>and</b> <b>planetary</b> environment. The primary heliophysics science objectives of the mission are to study from such unprecedented vantage points and inter-probe separations how particles are accelerated at reconnection sites and shocks, and how turbulence develops and evolves in Earth’s magnetotail and in the solar wind. Additionally, the mission will de-termine the structure, formation, refilling, and downstream evolution of the <b>lunar</b> wake <b>and</b> explore particle acceleration processes within it.
