5|$|Bottomley {{was born}} on 23 March 1860, at 16 Saint Peter's Street, Bethnal Green in London, the second child and only son of William Bottomley, a tailor's cutter, and Elizabeth, née Holyoake.

A longstanding friendship between Bradlaugh and Elizabeth Holyoake led to rumours that he, not William Bottomley, was Horatio's biological father—a suggestion that Bottomley, in <b>later</b> <b>life,</b> was prone to encourage. The evidence is circumstantial, mainly based on the marked facial resemblance between Bradlaugh and Bottomley.|$|E

40|$|There is much {{interest}} in the causes of several adverse health outcomes in middle and old age. In searching for new explanations for adverse health outcomes <b>later</b> in <b>life,</b> researchers have started to look beyond behavioural risk factors to {{examine the effect of}} shocks to health in utero and in childhood on health in old age. In this paper we extend this literature to examine the long-term health effects of mass political violence experienced in utero and in childhood using China’s Cultural Revolution as a natural experiment. We find that individuals who were in utero in the Cultural Revolution have reduced lung capacity <b>later</b> in <b>life,</b> but we find no evidence that being in utero has adverse effects on other health indicators <b>later</b> in <b>life.</b> We find more evidence that being an adolescent in the Cultural Revolution has an adverse effect on health <b>later</b> in <b>life.</b> Specifically, we find that individuals who were adolescents in the Cultural Revolution have higher blood pressure and reduced ability to engage in activities of daily living <b>later</b> in <b>life.</b> We also find that males who were adolescents in the Cultural Revolution have reduced cognitive skills <b>later</b> in <b>life,</b> while females who were adolescents in the Cultural Revolution have reduced lung capacity in middle and old age. specific recommendations for the Canadian context.
