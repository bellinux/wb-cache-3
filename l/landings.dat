5|$|In {{addition}} to the seaborne <b>landings,</b> there were also airborne <b>landings</b> during the invasion. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, under Major General Matthew Ridgway, would land {{in support of the}} Seventh Army, while the British 1st Airborne Division, under Major General George Hopkinson, conducted brigade-sized <b>landings</b> along the eastern coast to support the Eighth Army.|$|E

5|$|Amphibious <b>landings</b> at Utah {{were to be}} {{preceded by}} {{airborne}} <b>landings</b> further inland on the Cotentin Peninsula commencing shortly after midnight. Forty minutes of naval bombardment was to begin at 05:50, followed by air bombardment, scheduled for 06:09 to 06:27.|$|E

50|$|Public Landing enjoyed great {{popularity}} {{during the}} 1920s and early 1930s, when rides, a bowling alley, and other amusements were open, and the shallowness of Chincoteague Bay permitted public bathing. However, a large hurricane in 1933 destroyed Public <b>Landing's</b> waterfront. Although a pier was rebuilt, and public bathing continued, Public <b>Landing's</b> heyday as a waterfront destination was overtaken by Ocean City.|$|R

5|$|Apart {{from the}} Southern Rhodesian airmen serving with the RAF in Britain, the colony was sparsely {{represented}} in the Normandy <b>landings</b> of 6 June 1944 ("D-Day"). Several men from the colony served aboard cruisers and destroyers that engaged the German shore batteries. A small number of Southern Rhodesians parachuted into Normandy with the 6th Airborne Division during Operation Tonga, and some {{took part in the}} amphibious <b>landings.</b> No. 266 Squadron was part of the Allied force that flew over the beaches during the first <b>landings,</b> supporting the infantry. Later that day it took part in sorties to assist the paratroopers holding the bridgeheads north of Caen.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that the <b>landings</b> on Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo were taking place, Allied troops were also landing on nearby Guadalcanal, with the {{objective}} of capturing an airfield under construction by Japanese forces. In contrast to the intense fighting on Tulagi and Gavutu, the <b>landings</b> on Guadalcanal were essentially unopposed. The <b>landings</b> on both Tulagi and Guadalcanal initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign and a series of combined-arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands area.|$|E
5|$|During the Burma Campaign in 1944–1945, the 3rd Commando Brigade {{participated in}} several coastal <b>landings</b> of the Southern Front offensive. These <b>landings</b> {{culminated in the}} battle of Hill 170 at Kangaw. Here Lieutenant George Knowland of No. 1 Commando was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. The Commandos' victory in the 36-hour battle for Hill 170 cut off the escape of the 54th Japanese Division. Further amphibious <b>landings</b> by the 25th Indian Infantry Division and the {{overland}} advance of the 82nd (West Africa) Division made the Japanese position in the Arakan untenable. A general withdrawal was ordered to avoid the complete destruction of the Twenty-Eighth Japanese Army. The Commando brigade was then withdrawn to India in preparation for Operation Zipper, the planned invasion of Malaya. The Zipper <b>landings</b> were not needed due to the Japanese surrender so the brigade was sent to Hong Kong for policing duties instead.|$|E

That same year, the French magazine Paris Match commissioned him to produce a short comic documenting the Apollo 12 <b>landings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Supporting the Japanese <b>landings</b> were {{seaplanes}} from Kamikawa Maru, temporarily {{based at}} Thousand Ships Bay at Santa Isabel Island. About 400 Japanese naval troops—mainly from the 3rd Kure Special Naval Landing Force—disembarked from the transport ship on barges and immediately began construction of facilities on Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo. Aircraft from Shōhō covered the <b>landings</b> until early afternoon, when Gotō's force turned toward Bougainville to refuel in preparation {{to support the}} <b>landings</b> at Port Moresby. Once the Japanese troops were ashore, six seaplanes landed in Tulagi harbor {{as part of the}} establishment of the planned seaplane base there.|$|E

5|$|The Allied {{casualties}} at the <b>landings</b> {{were very}} light, with only 95killed and 385 wounded. 40 of those casualties {{were caused by}} a rocket-boosted Henschel Hs 293 guided gliding bomb launched from a Do-217 bomber aircraft by a rare appearance of the bomber wing KG 100, which sank the tank landing ship USS LST-282. In conjunction with the sea landing, airborne and glider <b>landings</b> (Mission Albatross followed by Mission Dove, Mission Bluebird, and Mission Canary) around the area of Le Muy were carried out. They were as successful as the beach <b>landings,</b> with only 104 dead, 24 of which were caused by glider accidents and 18 by parachute accidents.|$|E
5|$|The {{service would}} {{ultimately}} have 21 <b>landings,</b> of which ten would be brand-new, five would be upgraded, and six would be preexisting <b>landings</b> {{that would not}} be changed with the addition of NYC Ferry routes. The existing East River Ferry <b>landings</b> at Brooklyn Bridge Park Pier 1; Schaefer Landing; North Williamsburg; Greenpoint; and Long Island City remained unchanged. There would be upgrades to the <b>landings</b> at Wall Street; East 34th Street; East 92nd Street; Brooklyn Army Terminal; and Brooklyn Bridge Park Pier 6. The remaining <b>landings</b> were built as part of the project. A stop on Governor's Island was implemented along one of the routes to South Brooklyn. At the time, Governor's Island Ferry, the only public access to the island, runs seasonally between May and September, but the proposed Governor's Island stop would feature ferry service year-round. It was decided to build the Rockaway dock at Beach 108th Street, but a second dock could not be built further east than Beach 84th Street due to height restrictions caused by the Rockaway Line subway bridge. Construction on the first dock, the Rockaway landing, began in January 2017.|$|E
5|$|Arrangements for naval gunfire {{support to}} the <b>landings,</b> had {{originally}} included bombarding the beaches and approaches but was changed to engagement of the ridges during the <b>landings,</b> with the beaches only to be shelled prior to the <b>landings.</b> No decision was ultimately made {{on the issue of}} close-support, and it was left up to the initiative of individual ships' captains. A reluctance to approach the shore later impacted on <b>landings</b> at 'V' and 'W' beach where some of the heaviest losses among the infantry occurred, while naval gunfire was of some assistance at 'S', 'X' and Anzac. Even then its effectiveness was limited by the initial confusion ashore, the broken terrain, thick vegetation, and the lack of observation. Kitchener had ruled that air requirements must be met by the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and the Allies employed a small force of seaplanes and other aircraft from 3 Squadron, RNAS (Commander Charles Samson) which arrived at Tenedos at the end of March. The aircraft were unopposed by the small Ottoman air force at first and during the planning, the force had been used to provide aerial reconnaissance, although this ultimately proved inadequate to meet the Allies' intelligence needs and make up for the lack of adequate maps. After the <b>landings,</b> Allied aircraft conducted photographic reconnaissance, observed naval gunfire, reported on Ottoman troop movements and conducted a small number of bombing raids.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{unpredictable}} weather, aircraft continued {{to arrive at}} Nadzab sporadically. Only the 2/25th Infantry Battalion {{and part of the}} 2/33rd had reached Nadzab by the morning of 8 September when Vasey ordered the commander of the 25th Infantry Brigade, Brigadier Ken Eather, to initiate the advance on Lae. That day there were 112 <b>landings</b> at Nadzab. On 9 September, as the advance began, the rest of the 2/33rd Infantry Battalion reached Nadzab from Tsili Tsili, but while there were 116 <b>landings</b> at Nadzab, bad weather prevented the 2/31st Infantry Battalion from leaving Port Moresby. Finally, on 12 September, after three non-flying days, the 2/31st Infantry Battalion reached Nadzab on some of the 130 <b>landings</b> on the two strips at Nadzab that day.|$|E
