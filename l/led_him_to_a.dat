Darius first finished defeating the rebels in Elam, Assyria, and Babylon and then attacked the Scythian invaders. He pursued the invaders, who <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> marsh; there he found no known enemies but an enigmatic Scythian tribe.|$|E

25|$|On a writ of habeas corpus, jailers took Solomon to the Court of King's Bench. The {{application}} {{failed and}} the guards <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hackney {{coach for the}} return to Newgate. Unknown to his captors, the coach was driven by Solomon's father-in-law. The turnkeys approved a detour through Petticoat Lane. At a prearranged place, some of Solomon's friends overpowered the guards and released him.|$|E
25|$|The Kisei {{title was}} defended by Cho in 1985. It {{went all the}} way, through all 7 games. There was a {{dramatic}} final where Takemiya Masaki had a huge moyo that was 120 points big. Cho was lucky, as his corners and side territory <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 1.5 point win. At {{the same time he}} had happiness, there was sadness as Kobayashi took the Meijin title which Cho had held for 5 years.|$|E

25|$|Kinzer's {{examination}} of the same work <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> firmer belief that Bolton and Boulton were also one and the same. Additionally, a letter by an M.P.W. Bolton is archived at Trinity College, Cambridge, although a biographical work listing all of the university's known students has no record of any such person, only that of Boulton. Examination of other letters written by both Bolton and Boulton also hold that their handwriting scripts closely resemble each other.|$|E
25|$|Rivette's {{difficulties}} in securing financial backing for his films {{during the late}} 1970s <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> business partnership with Pierre Grise Productions and producer Martine Marignac. The company was the chief distributor and financier for all his subsequent films. Their first film, 1984's Love on the Ground, again concerned a theatrical group and the blurring of fiction and reality. Geraldine Chaplin and Jane Birkin star {{as members of a}} theatrical troupe who are invited to appear in a new play resembling the real life of its director (Kalfon) and the mysterious disappearance of his wife.|$|E
25|$|Two {{additional}} {{events in}} Riesel's life <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{career as a}} labor reporter. The first occurred on March 6, 1930, {{during a visit to}} his father's union offices. Riesel saw a man weeping on the stairs because he had no job and his family had no food to eat. The second occurred in 1942. Nathan Riesel was now fighting organized crime influence in his union, and despaired of keeping his local out of criminal hands. Nathan Riesel was severely beaten by gangsters in 1942, and died five years later (in part due to the injuries suffered during and surgeries related to this attack).|$|E
50|$|In the mid 1970s, Enright {{introduced}} {{new methods}} that <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> algebraic {{way of looking}} at discrete series (which were fundamental representations constructed by Harish-Chandra in the early 1960s), and <b>to</b> <b>an</b> algebraic proof of the Blattner multiplicity formula.|$|R

25|$|Macedonski's {{eldest son}} Alexis {{continued}} {{to pursue a}} career as a painter. His son Soare followed in his footsteps, receiving acclaim from art critics of the period. Soare's short career ended in 1928, before he turned nineteen, but his works have been featured in several retrospective exhibitions, including one organized by Alexis. Alexis later experimented with scenic design as an assistant to French filmmaker René Clair; his later life, shrouded in mystery and intrigue, <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> career in Fascist Italy and Francoist Spain. Another of Alexandru Macedonski's sons, Nikita, was also a poet and painter. For a while in the 1920s, he edited the literary supplement of Universul newspaper. Two years after her father's death, Anna Macedonski married poet Mihail Celarianu.|$|E
25|$|Stilwell's rebellious {{attitude}} <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{record of}} unruly behavior once he reached a post-graduate level at Yonkers High School. Prior to this last year, Stilwell had performed meticulously in his classes, and had participated actively in football (as quarterback) and track. Under {{the discretion of}} his father, Stilwell was placed into a post-graduate course following graduation, and immediately formed {{a group of friends}} whose activities ranged from card playing to stealing the desserts from the senior dance in 1900. This last event, in which an administrator was punched, led to the expulsions and suspensions for Stilwell's friends. Stilwell, meanwhile, having already graduated, was once again by his father's guidance sent to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point, rather than Yale University as originally planned.|$|E
25|$|However, this is then {{revealed}} to be an attack by Doom, as Meggan uses her powers to cause rebellion among Dracula's less loyal conscripts. Brian launches a second attack to assist her, this time showing his full power against Lilith, {{just in time for}} Dracula to learn that Wisdom had not led him to the skull of Quincy Harker but had instead <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fake; every action by MI:13 was to ensure Dracula wouldn't know the protection spell around the country was still active, leading to the vampire army being mostly wiped out as they remain uninvited. Dracula and his remaining loyal soldiers retreat to their fortress, trying to protect Lilith, but are pursued by MI:13, MI:13's reserves, and a Special Air Service team. Union Jack and Blade take out Dracula's coffin, Faiza destroys the Count with Excalibur, and Brian is able to destroy Lilith.|$|E

Thus began about ten years of wandering, {{including}} his frequent hut burning, ending with a permanent and very austere cell.|$|R
50|$|His {{skill at}} playing the viola <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> {{perform in the}} Denver Symphony Orchestra; {{he was a member}} from 1907, and in the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra from 1914. From 1917 to 1918, Whiteman conducted a 40-piece U.S. Navy band. After the war, he formed the Paul Whiteman Orchestra.|$|R
25|$|Dirac's {{attention}} {{was drawn to}} a mysterious mathematical relationship, at first sight unintelligible, that Heisenberg had reached. Several weeks later, back in Cambridge, Dirac suddenly recognised that this mathematical form had the same structure as the Poisson brackets {{that occur in the}} classical dynamics of particle motion. From this thought he quickly developed a quantum theory that was based on non-commuting dynamical variables. This <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more profound and significant general formulation of quantum mechanics than was achieved by any other worker in this field. Dirac's formulation allowed him to obtain the quantisation rules in a novel and more illuminating manner. For this work, published in 1926, Dirac received a PhD from Cambridge. This formed the basis for Fermi-Dirac statistics that applies to systems consisting of many identical spin 1/2 particles (i.e. that obey the Pauli exclusion principle), e.g. electrons in solids and liquids, and importantly to the field of conduction in semi-conductors.|$|E
25|$|Among Galen's major {{contributions}} to medicine was {{his work on}} the circulatory system. He was the first to recognize that there are distinct differences between venous (dark) and arterial (bright) blood. Although his anatomical experiments on animal models <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more complete understanding of the circulatory system, nervous system, respiratory system, and other structures, his work contained scientific errors. Galen believed the circulatory system to consist of two separate one-way systems of distribution, rather than a single unified system of circulation. He believed venous blood to be generated in the liver, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. He posited that arterial blood originated in the heart, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. The blood was then regenerated in either the liver or the heart, completing the cycle. Galen also believed in the existence of a group of blood vessels he called the rete mirabile in the carotid sinus. Both of these theories of the circulation of blood were later shown to be incorrect by Ibn al-Nafis.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1930s, von Neumann {{developed}} an expertise in explosions—phenomena {{that are difficult to}} model mathematically. During this period von Neumann was the leading authority of the mathematics of shaped charges. This <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large number of military consultancies, primarily for the Navy, which in turn led to his involvement in the Manhattan Project. The involvement included frequent trips by train to the project's secret research facilities at the [...] Los Alamos Laboratory.|$|E

He changed his diet, becoming more health-conscious and eating mostly unprocessed foods. Through regular practice of vipassana and yoga, he discovered the effect that self-discipline has on the body. To maintain his increased spiritual awareness and reduce distraction from his music, Frusciante decided to abstain from sexual activity stating: [...] "I'm very well without it."

500|$|Although Herschel {{continued}} {{to describe his}} new object as a comet, other astronomers {{had already begun to}} suspect otherwise. Finnish-Swedish astronomer Anders Johan Lexell, working in Russia, was the first to compute the orbit of the new object. Its nearly circular orbit <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> conclusion that it was a planet rather than a comet. Berlin astronomer Johann Elert Bode described Herschel's discovery as [...] "a moving star that can be deemed a hitherto unknown planet-like object circulating beyond the orbit of Saturn". Bode concluded that its near-circular orbit was more like a planet than a comet.|$|E
500|$|In February 1904, Crowley and Rose {{arrived in}} Cairo. Claiming to be a prince and princess, they rented an {{apartment}} in which Crowley set up a temple room and began invoking ancient Egyptian deities, while studying Islamic mysticism and Arabic. According to Crowley's later account, Rose regularly became delirious and informed him [...] "they are waiting for you." [...] On 18 March, she explained that [...] "they" [...] were the god Horus, and on 20 March proclaimed that [...] "the Equinox of the Gods has come". She <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> nearby museum, where she showed him a seventh-century BCE mortuary stele known as the Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu; Crowley thought it important that the exhibit's number was 666, {{the number of the}} beast in Christian belief, and in later years termed the artefact the [...] "Stele of Revealing." ...|$|E
