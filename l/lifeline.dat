5|$|The game uses a pay-what-you-want pricing model: it {{is free to}} play, but {{players can}} pay any amount they think is appropriate. Part of the {{proceeds}} from the game are sent to a charity – initially iFred, but this was later changed to the National Suicide Prevention <b>Lifeline</b> after the game was released on Steam.|$|E
5|$|The {{impacts on}} lifelines {{may also be}} inter-dependent. The {{vulnerability}} of each <b>lifeline</b> may depend on: the type of hazard, the spatial density of its critical linkages, the dependency on critical linkages, susceptibility to damage and speed of service restoration, state of repair or age, and institutional characteristics or ownership.|$|E
50|$|<b>LifeLines</b> {{is a free}} {{open-source}} genealogy {{software tool}} to assist family history research. <b>LifeLines</b> primary strengths are its powerful scripting language {{and the ability to}} easily import and export information in the GEDCOM format. It was the first open-source genealogy program for Unix. The <b>Lifelines</b> scripting language is now supported by several other open-source programs.|$|R
50|$|Each of the <b>lifelines</b> {{can only}} be used once during the game, and a {{contestant}} has no way to use {{more than one of}} the <b>lifelines</b> on one single question.|$|R
40|$|Thirty-six {{participants}} used {{a static}} version of either <b>LifeLines,</b> a graphical interface, or a Tabular representation {{to answer questions}} about a database of temporal personal history information. Results suggest that overall the <b>LifeLines</b> representation led to much faster response times, primarily for questions which involved interval comparisons and making intercategorical connections. A "first impression" test showed that <b>LifeLines</b> can reduce some of the biases of the tabular record summary. A post-experimental memory test led to significantly (p<. 004) higher recall for <b>LifeLines.</b> Finally, simple interaction techniques are proposed to compensate for the problems of the static <b>LifeLines</b> display's ability to deal with precise dates, attribute coding and overlaps. INTRODUCTION The way in which temporal data is represented has a dramatic effect on the way we interpret and use those data. Metaphors and analogies have been used quite effectively to aid the user and provide a mental model [...] ...|$|R
5|$|The show's lifelines {{sometimes}} used corporate sponsorship. The Phone-a-Friend <b>lifeline</b> {{was sponsored by}} the original AT throughout the run of the ABC primetime show and in the first season of the syndicated version, then by the current AT for the 2009 primetime episodes. From 2004 to 2006, Ask the Audience was sponsored by AOL, which allowed users of its Instant Messenger to add the screen name MillionaireIM to their buddy list and receive an instant message with the question and the four possible answers, to which the users replied with their choices. In addition, the Ask the Expert <b>lifeline</b> was sponsored by Skype for its live audio and video feeds.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath has one museum, {{the former}} Bell Rock Lighthouse Signal Tower. In 1807 Arbroath became {{the base of}} {{operations}} for the building of the Bell Rock Lighthouse. The shore station for the lighthouse – the Bell Rock Signal Tower – was completed in 1813 and acted as a <b>lifeline</b> for the keepers offshore. Signal Tower Museum was opened in 1974 as a visitor centre detailing the history of the lighthouse and the town of Arbroath.|$|E
5|$|By 1872, the {{railroad}} had extended from Portland to Roseburg. Along the way, it created growth in Willamette Valley {{towns such as}} Canby, Aurora, and Harrisburg, which emerged as freight and passenger stations, and provided a commercial <b>lifeline</b> to {{the part of the}} river valley above Harrisburg where steamships were rarely able to travel. As {{the railroad}} made its way into the Umpqua Valley, new townsites such as Drain, Oakland, and Yoncalla were laid out.|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of <b>lifelines</b> against earthquakes and seismic hazard effects on them are studied in this paper. As <b>lifelines</b> pass through wide areas, {{it may be}} affected by many seismic hazards. These hazards are such as ground rupture, fault movement, landslides and large deformation due to liquefaction. Based on the experiences from past earthquakes, damages to the <b>lifelines</b> with attention to damaged parts are classified and illustrated. This classification {{is based on the}} damages of body, joints, facilities and serviceability. Since the buried <b>lifelines</b> are filled with some materials with almost same unit weight of soil, their seismic response characteristics are different from buildings or buried foundations. Surrounding soil affects its seismic behavior. These effective factors are ground characteristic, earthquake characteristic and structure condition...|$|R

5|$|Contestants {{are given}} a series of lifelines to aid them with {{difficult}} questions. They can use as many lifelines as desired per question, but each <b>lifeline</b> can only be used once per game. Three lifelines {{are available from the}} start of the game. Depending on the format of the show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question. In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily paused the clock while the lifelines were played.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{infrastructure}} and infrastructure services {{are vital to}} the functionality of modern society, to provide: medical care, policing, emergency services, and lifelines such as water, wastewater, and power and transportation links. Often critical facilities themselves are dependent on such lifelines for operability, which makes them vulnerable to both direct impacts from a hazard event and indirect effects from <b>lifeline</b> disruption.|$|E
5|$|In March 2012, Holden {{was given}} a $270million <b>lifeline</b> by the Gillard, Weatherill and Baillieu ministries. In return, Holden planned to inject over $1billion into car {{manufacturing}} in Australia. They estimated the new investment package would return around $4billion to the Australian economy and see GM Holden continue making cars in Australia until at least 2022.|$|E

5|$|The {{protection}} of infrastructure {{must also be}} considered within emergency preparedness. Critical facilities that need to remain operable should be identified, and all others should be shut down to reduce damage. It is also important to keep ash out of buildings, machinery and <b>lifeline</b> networks (in particular water and wastewater systems,) to prevent some of the damage caused by ash particles. Windows and doors should be closed and shuttered if possible, to prevent ingress of ash into buildings.|$|E
5|$|Depression Quest is a 2013 {{interactive}} fiction game {{dealing with}} the subject of depression. It was developed by Zoë Quinn using the Twine engine, with writing by Patrick Lindsey and music by Isaac Schankler. It was first released for the web on February 14, 2013, and for Steam on August 11, 2014. The game {{tells the story of}} a person suffering from depression and their attempts to deal with their affliction. It was created to foster greater understanding about depression. Depression Quest can be played for free, and has a pay-what-you-want pricing model. The National Suicide Prevention <b>Lifeline</b> receives part of the proceeds.|$|E
5|$|In November 1775, Washington {{sent the}} 25-year-old bookseller-turned-soldier Henry Knox {{to bring to}} Boston the heavy {{artillery}} that had been captured at Fort Ticonderoga. In a technically complex and demanding operation, Knox brought many cannons to the Boston area by January 1776. In March 1776, these artillery fortified Dorchester Heights (which overlooked Boston and its harbor), thereby threatening the British supply <b>lifeline.</b> The British commander William Howe saw the British position as indefensible and withdrew the British forces in Boston to the British stronghold at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on March 17 (celebrated today as Evacuation Day).|$|E
5000|$|Patrick Hugh won $1,000 {{during a}} Season 7 (syndicated) episode, but a {{critical}} word in his $25,000 question {{was found to}} be misspelled.
