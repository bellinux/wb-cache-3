40|$|The {{functional}} analysis of genes using genomes {{is a major}} research issue in modern biology. Functional analysis {{is the study of}} how a biological entity is functionally related to other biological entities. Typical questions include: does gene X encode chemical Y in organism Z? What behavior B does gene X regulate? Which other genes regulate the same behavior in other organisms? Information integration is necessary to perform successful {{functional analysis}}, since biologists must compare data from multiple sources of different types to answer such questions. Such data integration for functional analysis is still extremely difficult. It is carried out largely by hand, in a labor-intensive and error-prone process, in literature citations and genome annotations. Expert database curators can tag the necessary entities and relations, but the scale of such human efforts is far less than even the current scale of the available information. A typical search query for bioinformatics sources today is at the level of words and phrases. This is not a high enough level conceptually to enable the comparisons across sources necessary for functional analysis. Most bioinformatics research is focused upon this data <b>level,</b> <b>trying</b> to find patterns directly within the genome sources such as sequences or within the biomedical literature. Most of the rest of bioinformatics research is focused upon jumping directly to the knowledge <b>level,</b> <b>trying</b> to find pattern...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUpon {{in vitro}} myogenesis, the {{intermediate}} filament protein vimentin {{is replaced by}} desmin, the switch in gene expression occurring essentially at the transcriptional <b>level.</b> <b>Trying</b> to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of this genetic control, we show here that the vimentin promoter is specifically recognized and activated by a protein most probably identical to H 4 TF- 1, and that this factor is present in proliferating myoblasts but disappears upon fusion of these cells into multinucleated myotubes. Our results suggest that H 4 TF- 1 is a differentiation stage-specific factor involved in the downregulation of vimentin gene expression during myogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Organizational {{decision}} making often involves two decision levels. When the {{leader at the}} upper level attempts to optimize his/her objective, the follower at the lower <b>level</b> <b>tries</b> to find an optimized strategy according to each of possible decisions made by the leader. Furthermore, such bilevel {{decision making}} may involve uncertain parameters which appear either in the objective functions or constraints of the leader or the follower. Following our previous work on fuzzy bilevel decision making, this study proposes a solution concept and related theorems for general- fuzzy-number based fuzzy parameter bilevel programming problems. It then develops an approximation Branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the proposed problem...|$|R

In {{this project}} {{we aim to}} analyze “honest signals ” between Jazz musicians by using sociometric badges {{with the goal of}} {{identifying}} some of the pre-requisites for “flow”, the state of work where “time flies”, and the worker is at his most-productive best. We extend the concept of individual “flow ” as defined by Csikszentmihalyi (1990) to the group <b>level,</b> <b>trying</b> to identify some of the conditions indicative of the group flow state. We speculate that a band of Jazz musicians is particularly well suited to study group flow, because they collaborate as a self-organizing team, involved in highly creatively work while passing leadership of the tune for the solo part from one band member to the next...|$|R
