5|$|In the prologue, John {{identifies}} Jesus as the <b>Logos</b> (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, {{the term}} <b>logos</b> meant {{the principle of}} cosmic reason. In this sense, it {{was similar to the}} Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described the <b>Logos</b> as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of the <b>Logos,</b> applying it to Jesus, the incarnation of the <b>Logos.</b>|$|E

5|$|Shirts are {{normally}} {{made of a}} polyester mesh, which does not trap the sweat and body heat {{in the same way}} as a shirt made of a natural fibre. Most professional clubs have sponsors' <b>logos</b> on the front of their shirts, which can generate significant levels of income, and some also offer sponsors the chance to place their <b>logos</b> on the back of their shirts. Depending on local rules, there may be restrictions on how large these <b>logos</b> may be or on what <b>logos</b> may be displayed. Competitions such as the Premier League may also require players to wear patches on their sleeves depicting the logo of the competition. A player's number is usually printed on the back of the shirt, although international teams often also place numbers on the front, and professional teams generally print a player's surname above his number. The captain of each team is usually required to wear an elasticated armband around the left sleeve to identify him as the captain to the referee and supporters.|$|E

It was almost twice the height as the Beano <b>logo</b> at one point.In 2008, for 3 issues in the summer, the <b>logo</b> changed so that the MAX was predominant to the Beano <b>logo.</b> Instead of the Beano <b>logo</b> running horizontal, it was now vertical, alongside the MAX which was by now on a diagonal bar. After these three issues, the BeanoMAX <b>logo</b> changed back to the style it had gained in late 2007.In 2009, the <b>logo</b> changed again, with the Beano <b>logo</b> directly above the MAX <b>logo.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although not {{commonly}} {{understood as}} Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully {{argued that the}} Gospel of John has elements in common with Gnosticism. Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it. To say John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the author to respond to it. Bultmann, for example, argued that the opening theme of the Gospel of John, the pre-existing <b>Logos,</b> was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown {{have argued that the}} pre-existing <b>Logos</b> theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by Philo Judaeus.|$|E

5000|$|The sound <b>logo</b> (or audio mnemonic) {{is one of}} {{the tools}} of sound branding, along with the jingle, brand music, and brand theme. A sound <b>logo</b> (or audio <b>logo</b> or sonic <b>logo)</b> is a short {{distinctive}} melody or other sequence of sound, mostly positioned at the beginning or ending of a commercial. It {{can be seen as the}} acoustic equivalent of a visual <b>logo.</b> Often a combination of both types of <b>logo</b> is used to enforce the recognition of a brand. An example is the T-Mobile <b>logo</b> and ringtone composed by Lance Massey, the Intel <b>logo</b> composed by Walter Werzowa, or the Michelin <b>logo</b> composed by SixiÃ¨me Son.|$|R
25|$|The Golden West Network {{became a}} network in 1986, with a shared <b>logo</b> {{produced}} and used across the regional stations, featuring the letters GWN inside an outlined oval {{surrounded by an}} orbiting ring.
