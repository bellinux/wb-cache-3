We define environmental pollutants as toxic chemicals of human origin in air, food, water, and communities. To develop estimates of costs, we relied on data from the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Health Care Financing Agency, and the Practice Management Information Corporation. EAFs were judged to be 100 % for lead poisoning, 30 % for asthma (range, 10 - 35 %), 5 % for cancer (range, 2 - 10 %), and 10 % for neurobehavioral disorders (range, 5 - 20 %). Total annual costs are estimated to be $ 54. 9 billion (range $ 48. 8 - 64. 8 billion) : $ 43. 4 billion for lead poisoning, $ 2. 0 billion for asthma, $ 0. 3 billion for childhood cancer, and $ 9. 2 billion for neurobehavioral disorders. This sum amounts to 2. 8 percent of total U. S. health care costs. This estimate is likely low because it considers only four categories of illness, incorporates conservative assumptions, ignores costs of pain and suffering, and does not include late complications for which etiologic associations are poorly quantified. The costs of pediatric environmental disease are high, in contrast with the limited resources directed to research, tracking, and prevention...|$|E
40|$|Children {{are exposed}} {{to a wide range}} of toxic {{chemicals}} on a daily basis that their developing bodies are particularly ill-equipped to manage. Surprisingly little is known about the health effects of the vast majority of the chemicals that currently exist in the environment, and even less is known about the unique susceptibility of children. The changing pattern of childhood illnesses represents a shift from infectious diseases and genetic abnormalities to those of potentially preventable origin. Childhood diseases are now more often the result of a combination of factors, including both environmental triggers and genetic susceptibility. Maine children are no exception to what has been called the “new pediatric morbidity, ” and suffer from comparatively high rates of asthma and cancer. Maine children are also at an increased risk of lead poisoning due to the aging housing stock and historical industrial activities. In order to understand the economic impact of environmentally-related childhood diseases in Maine, this report provides a detailed estimate of the annual cost in four broad illness categories: <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning,</b> <b>asthma,</b> childhood cancer, and neurobehavioral disorders.

In today 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s competitive grant- writing climate, data-driven demonstration of need can help your non-profit make a stronger argument for the importance of continuing/expanding services to the populations served by your organization. This cookbook was created to introduce program managers and grant writers to available data sources on the housing-related health conditions of <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning,</b> <b>asthma,</b> and unintentional home injuries and to provide guidance on how to use these data to highlight milestones and successes. The cookbook presents national, Georgia, Fulton County, Atlanta, and Atlanta Neighborhood Planning Unit-V (NPU-V) -level data as examples of comparisons of morbidity and mortality across the different geographic areas. However, most of the datasets described here are available {{in other areas of the}} country. Information in this cookbook about which organizations collect and analyze health data, along with the key staff members at those organizations, is intended to help program managers build relationships for data-sharing, learn from best practices, and develop referral networks. This cookbook also describes surveillance systems for elevated blood lead, asthma, and home injuries; the description can assist program managers in creating evaluation plans for their organizations 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 green and healthy homes interventions.

40|$|Lead is {{a natural}} element that is {{persistent}} in water and soil. Human exposure occurs primarily through diet, air, drinking water and ingestion of paint chips. Absorption is increased in persons suffering from iron and calcium deficiency. Lead is a multitargated toxicant, causing effects in the gastrointestinal tract, hematopoietic system, cardiovascular system, central and peripheral nervous systems, kidneys, immune system, and reproductive system. <b>Lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> is a common environmental health hazard in developing countries. Incidences of <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> are seen in all age groups, especially in children’s and adults working in lead-based industries, where many workers still remain unaware of the adverse effects of exposure to unusually high levels of lead.

40|$|BackgroundDespite {{significant}} progress made {{in recent decades}} in preventing childhood <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> in the United States through the control or elimination of lead sources in the environment, {{it continues to be}} an issue in many communities, primarily in low-income communities with a large percentage of deteriorating housing built before the elimination of lead in residential paint. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether state laws aimed at preventing childhood <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> are also effective in preventing recurring <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> among children previously poisoned. MethodsAn evaluation was conducted to determine whether laws in two representative states, Massachusetts and Ohio, have been effective in preventing recurrent <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> among children less than 72 months of age previously poisoned, compared to a representative state (Mississippi) which at the time of the study had yet to develop legislation to prevent childhood <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning.</b> ResultsCompared to no legislation, unadjusted estimates showed children less than 72 months old, living in Massachusetts, previously identified as being <b>lead</b> <b>poisoned,</b> were 73 % less likely to develop recurrent <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning.</b> However, this statistically significant association did not remain after controlling for other confounding variables. We did not find such a significant association when analyzing data from Ohio. ConclusionsWhile findings from unadjusted estimates indicated that state lead laws such as those in Massachusetts may be effective at preventing recurrent <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> among young children, small numbers may have attenuated the power to obtain statistical significance during multivariate analysis. Our findings did not provide evidence that state lead laws, such as those in Ohio, were effective in preventing recurrent <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> among young children.
