50|$|Marsden square mapping or Marsden squares is {{a system}} that divides a chart of the world with <b>{{latitude}}-longitude</b> gridlines (e.g. plate carrée projection, Mercator or other) between 80°N and 70°S latitudes (or 90°N and 80°S: refer chart at Ocean Teacher’s Ocean Geography page) into grid cells of 10° latitude by 10° longitude, each with a unique, numeric identifier.|$|E
50|$|Colorado {{is notable}} for its diverse geography, ranging from alpine mountains, arid plains and deserts with huge sand dunes, deep canyons, {{sandstone}} and granite rock formations, rivers, lakes, and lush forests. The borders of Colorado were originally defined to be lines of latitude and longitude, making its shape a <b>latitude-longitude</b> quadrangle which stretches from 37°N to 41°N latitude and from 102°03'W to 109°03'W longitude (25°W to 32°W from the Washington Meridian).

50|$|It is {{relatively}} simple to re-plot a gridded {{map of the}} world onto a Schmidt net if the azimuth is chosen to be the junction of the equator with any particular meridian from the world-map's grid. Each grid square surrounding this chosen longitude is simply re-plotted into the corresponding distorted grid-square in the Schmidt net. Points of <b>latitude-longitude</b> can be plotted relative to the azimuth's longitude, interpolating between grid lines in the Schmidt net. For greater accuracy it is helpful to have a net with finer spacing than 10°; spacings of 2° are common.|$|E
5000|$|The gridpoints along each {{latitude}} (or parallel), i.e., the longitudes, {{are equally}} spaced. Thus, at each latitude, {{the distance between}} any two adjacent degrees of longitude is the same. However the gridpoints along each longitude (or meridian), i.e., the latitudes, are unequally spaced: the distance between adjacent degrees of latitude will vary. Instead, spacing of latitudes {{is defined by the}} Gaussian quadrature. By contrast, in the [...] "normal" [...] geographic <b>latitude-longitude</b> grid, gridpoints are equally spaced along both latitudes and longitudes. Gaussian grids also have no grid points at the poles.|$|E
5000|$|Geoparsing is {{the process}} of {{converting}} free-text descriptions of places (such as [...] "twenty miles northeast of Jalalabad") into unambiguous geographic identifiers, such as geographic coordinates expressed as <b>latitude-longitude.</b> One can also geoparse location references from other forms of media, for examples audio content in which a speaker mentions a place. With geographic coordinates the features can be mapped and entered into Geographic Information Systems. Two primary uses of the geographic coordinates derived from unstructured content are to plot portions of the content on maps and to search the content using a map as a filter.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that these}} {{limitations}} are {{not due to}} geohashing, and not due to <b>latitude-longitude</b> coordinates, but due {{to the difficulty of}} mapping coordinates on a sphere (non linear and with wrapping of values, similar to modulo arithmetic) to two dimensional coordinates and the difficulty of exploring a two dimensional space uniformly. The first is related to Geographical coordinate system and Map projection, and the other to Hilbert curve and z-order curve. Once a coordinate system is found that represents points linearly in distance and wraps up at the edges, and can be explored uniformly, applying geohashing to those coordinates will not suffer from the limitations above.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} of OGCMs assumed “rigid lid” to eliminate high-speed external gravity waves. According to CFL criteria without those fast waves, we can use a bigger time step, which is not so computationally expensive. But it also filtered those ocean tides and other waves having the speed of tsunamis. Within this assumption Bryan and co-worker Cox developed a 2D model, a 3D box model, and then a model of full circulation in GFDL, with variable density as well, for the world ocean with its complex coastline and bottom topography. The first application with specified global geometry {{was done in the}} early 1970s. Cox designed a 2° <b>latitude-longitude</b> grid with up to 12 vertical levels at each point.|$|E

5000|$|World Meteorological Organization squares or WMO squares is {{a system}} of geocodes that divides a chart {{of the world with}} <b>{{latitude}}-longitude</b> gridlines (e.g. plate carrée projection, Mercator or other) into grid cells of 10° latitude by 10° longitude, each with a unique, 4-digit numeric identifier (refer chart at NODC World Ocean Database 2005 page). On the plate carrée projection the grid cells appear square, however if the Mercator projection is used, the grid cells appear 'stretched' vertically nearer the tops and bottoms of the map. On the actual surface of the Globe, the cells are approximately [...] "square" [...] only adjacent to the equator, and become progressively narrower and tapered (also with curved northern and southern boundaries) as they approach the poles, and cells adjoining the poles are unique in possessing three faces rather than four.|$|E
50|$|The Schmidt net {{is not an}} {{appropriate}} grid for representing the Earth's northern or southern hemisphere (because the lines would not correspond to meridians or parallels in such a projection). However {{it can be used}} as a scalar measuring device for projecting <b>latitude-longitude</b> points onto a blank circle of the same size, to produce a Lambert equal-area projection with the azimuth at the north or south pole. The intersection of the parallels with the outer circle {{can be used as a}} de facto protractor for plotting a point's longitude as the angle in the polar projection. The Schmidt net's horizontal axis can then be used as a scalar measuring device to convert the point's latitude (relative to the pole) into a radial distance from the centre of the circle. Alternatively, the Schmidt net could be replaced entirely with a correctly projected polar grid, and grid squares from a map re-drawn into this disc.|$|E
50|$|A major design {{challenge}} of RDS-TMC {{was to find}} a way of describing traffic event locations across an entire state or country. Such a system could not convey precise <b>latitude-longitude</b> data (available 25 years later using GPS in applications such as Waze). Instead, RDS-TMC relies on the use of location tables that point only to significant highway junctions. The precision of each traffic event's location is low compared to that of modern smartphone devices. The user's navigation system locates a driver to about 3 metres (10 feet), but only knows, for example, that a crash took place between Exit 3 and Exit 4, northbound on a particular motorway. This limitation requires that traffic events (accidents, congestion, burst water mains, faulty traffic lights, etc.) have to be superimposed onto maps by mapping the reported location to the TMC location table. If the nearest location table point lies at some distance from the exact position of the incident, then the report appears on a section of main road between two junctions instead of at its exact location. The limited precision can make a significant difference as to how navigation devices interpret the incident, potentially leading to an occasional poor route choice.|$|E
50|$|As {{specified}} in the designating legislation for the Territory of Wyoming, Wyoming's borders are lines of latitude, 41°N and 45°N, and longitude, 104°3'W and 111°3'W (27° W and 34° W of the Washington Meridian), making {{the shape of the}} state a <b>latitude-longitude</b> quadrangle. Wyoming is one of only three states (along with Colorado and Utah) to have borders along only straight latitudinal and longitudinal lines, rather than being defined by natural landmarks. Due to surveying inaccuracies during the 19th century, Wyoming's legal border deviates from the true latitude and longitude lines by up to half of a mile (0.8 km) in some spots, especially in the mountainous region along the 45th parallel. Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho. It is the tenth largest state in the United States in total area, containing 97814 sq mi and is made up of 23 counties. From the north border to the south border it is 276 mi; and from the east to the west border is 365 mi at its south end and 342 mi at the north end.|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic wave {{propagation}} in the Earth-ionosphere cavity presents an interesting challenge for simulations. Three-dimensional <b>latitude-longitude</b> finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) models {{accounting for the}} bathymetry, topography and ionosphere have been developed and applied towards a number of applications previously. However, to date most of these models treat the ionosphere as a simple, isotropic exponential conductivity profile. Only recently has a <b>latitude-longitude</b> FDTD model been developed that treats the ionosphere as a magnetized cold plasma. This {{opens the door to}} modeling electromagnetic phenomena at higher frequencies and higher altitudes by accommodating more physics. Further, a geodesic (hexagonal-pentagonal) FDTD model that is more efficient, is easier to implement, and executes faster than <b>latitude-longitude</b> models has been recently developed. In this thesis, the magnetized cold plasma global <b>latitude-longitude</b> algorithm is adapted and implemented {{for the first time in}} a geodesic FDTD model of the Earth-ionosphere cavity.

40|$|ABSTRACT-A simple, free-surface, {{barotropic}} model and a nine-level, baroclinic model are numerically time integrated on both <b>latitude-longitude</b> grids and on Kuriharatype grids {{to compare the}} results obtained from the two grid systems. The prognostic variables are Fourier spacefiltered in the longitudinal direction on the latitudelongitude grids to {{permit the use of}} the same time-step length on both grids. With respect to geopotential height and zonal wind distributions and to the phase speed of wave propagation, the results from the {{barotropic model}}, time-integrated on a sector <b>latitude-longitude</b> grid, agree better with a high-resolution control lun than those computed on a modified Kurihara grid, particularly at high latitudes. The barotropic model is also timeintegrated on a hemispheric, <b>latitude-longitude</b> grid, and the results compare well with a high-resolution control. The latter comparison is performed on initial data having strong cross-polar flow. The mean sea-level pressure distribution obtained from a 64 -day time integration of the baroclinic model on a global, <b>latitude-longitude</b> grid is better than that derived from a similar model using a Kurihara grid of comparable resolution. For example, the tendency for the Kurihara grid model to predict excessive pressures in the north polar region is for the most part corrected by use of tha <b>latitude-longitude</b> grid. 1...|$|E
40|$|Pose {{uncertainty}} estimation of calibrated cameras {{is a common}} task {{in the field of}} computer vision and uses location uncertainties of image features. For spherical cameras, those uncertainties cannot be optimally described using conventional <b>latitude-longitude</b> representation. Increasing distortions close to the poles of the spherical coordinate system prevent a suitable description through Gaussians. To overcome this limitation, we present a consistent location uncertainty representation for spherical image features: Our approach is based on normal vectors in Cartesian space and applicable to any kind of camera with convex projection surfaces, such as catadioptric and spherical systems. We compare its performance against <b>latitude-longitude</b> representation by estimating camera pose uncertainties through first order error propagation in a weighted least squares pose estimation scenario. Our experiments on synthetic and real data show that the proposed approach delivers consistent results outperforming conventional <b>latitude-longitude</b> representation...|$|E
40|$|Currently, most {{operational}} forecasting models use <b>latitude-longitude</b> grids, whose {{convergence of}} meridians towards the poles limits parallel scaling. Quasi-uniform grids might avoid this limitation. Thuburn et al, JCP, 2009 and Ringler et al, JCP, 2010 have developed a method for arbitrarily-structured, orthogonal C-grids (TRiSK), which has many of the desirable properties of the C-grid on <b>latitude-longitude</b> grids but which works {{on a variety of}} quasi-uniform grids. Here, five quasi-uniform, orthogonal grids of the sphere are investigated using TRiSK to solve the shallow-water equations. We demonstrate some of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the hexagonal and triangular icosahedra, a Voronoi-ised cubed sphere, a Voronoi-ised skipped <b>latitude-longitude</b> grid and a grid of kites in comparison to a full <b>latitude-longitude</b> grid. We will show that the hexagonal-icosahedron gives the most accurate results (for least computational cost). All of the grids suffer from spurious computational modes; this is especially true of the kite grid, despite it having exactly twice as many velocity degrees of freedom as height degrees of freedom. However, the computational modes are easiest to control on the hexagonal icosahedron since they consist of vorticity oscillations on the dual grid which can be controlled using a diffusive advection scheme for potential vorticity. ...|$|E
40|$|Arguments for {{selection}} of a map grid are reiterated by illustrating the quantitative effects on data quality caused by using different grids. It is shown {{that the use of}} the rectangular <b>latitude-longitude</b> grid actually degrades data quality, increases stored data volume, and increases the complexity of data manipulation. Use of an equal-area grid is shown to be a proper way to aggregate data, but such grids are thought to be inconvenient. A solution to this dilemma is proposed by showing that the analysis and archival map grids need not be the same. The results of a proper analysis of the data on an equal-area grid can be remapped to the more 'convenient' rectangular <b>latitude-longitude</b> grid without loss of quality...|$|E

40|$|A {{high-order}} monotone {{and conservative}} cascade remapping algorithm between spherical grids (CaRS) is developed. This algorithm is {{specifically designed to}} remap between the cubed-sphere and regular <b>latitude–longitude</b> grids.

This allows for easy implementation of high-order subgrid-cell reconstructions as well as the application of advanced monotone filters. The accuracy of CaRS is assessed by remapping analytic fields from the regular <b>latitude–longitude</b> grid to the cubed-sphere grid. In terms of standard error measures, CaRS is found to be competitive relative to an existing algorithm when regridding from a fine to a coarse grid and more accurate when regridding from a coarse to a fine grid. 1...|$|E
