5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Lucas di Grassi {{challenged}} Jarno Trulli for the lead, but Trulli closed the racing line into turn one. As Trulli lost the rear end of the car going into turn three, di Grassi took the lead. The other Audi Sport Abt of Daniel Abt was less fortunate, being sent into a spin at the same corner, dropping {{to the back of the}} field. Nelson Piquet, Jr. immediately made up for ground lost in qualifying, gaining three positions during the first <b>lap,</b> <b>running</b> in tenth place. At turn six on the following lap, he went past Stéphane Sarrazin (Venturi) for ninth. While di Grassi built an early lead, several manoeuvres were made behind him, with Nicolas Prost (e.dams-Renault) losing two positions to Jérôme d'Ambrosio (Dragon Racing) and Vitantonio Liuzzi (Trulli GP), dropping back to seventh. Pole sitter Jarno Trulli looked to be in trouble with his car and lost positions continuously, running in thirteenth after lap twelve. Third placed Nick Heidfeld was also unable to hold onto his podium position, being overtaken by d'Ambrosio on lap thirteen.|$|E
25|$|At {{the finish}} of the 1966 Le Mans 24 hours, the two Shelby-American Inc. entered Ford GT40 MK II's were {{both on the}} lead <b>lap,</b> <b>running</b> first and second, with the car Hulme was partnering with Ken Miles in the lead. In the lead half-hour of the race, the Fords bunched up {{together}} in a pre-arranged plan for Bruce McLaren and Miles to cross the line, headlights ablaze, in a dead-heat. Unfortunately the dead-heat that Henry Ford II had so proudly planned did not come off, as the timekeepers decided that a dead-heat was technically impossible as the Hulme/Miles car had qualified faster than the McLaren/Amon car, and therefore covered a shorter race distance. Therefore, when the two cars arrived side-by-side at the finish, Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon were classified as the winners with Hulme and Ken Miles in second.|$|E

50|$|The 1913 winner Jules Goux was {{the final}} car to qualify. During a {{practice}} run on Thursday, he suffered a broken piston and broken connecting rod, which blew {{a hole in the}} Peugeot's engine block. The Premier team offered him a spare engine, and Goux spent the entire day working to install it. Late in the day, just minutes before sundown, Goux took the car to the track. After one single warm-up lap, he signaled to officials to start the run. His lap of 95 mph bumped James Reynolds, and Goux surprisingly made the field. Not as lucky was Dave Lewis. A day after suffering engine problems, Evans was on his qualifying <b>lap,</b> <b>running</b> over 100 mph. Two-thirds of the way through the lap, the bearings in the engine burned out, and broke the crankcase.|$|E

5000|$|A fitness fanatic himself, Provan {{continued}} Kearney's punishing {{and successful}} training routine giving Dragon {{sides of the}} period confidence that they could edge out their fatiguing opposition in the final twenty minutes of each encounter. [...] Provan set high standards {{for himself and his}} players directing a training mix that included sandhill running at Cronulla; <b>lap</b> <b>running</b> at Kogarah and touch-football. He was content to maintain a certain distance from the team and saw the captain-coach role as a tough, solitary role requiring him to stand slightly apart from his players. A teetotaller later in life, Provan occasionally shared a drink in the shed after a match but he would rarely finish the first beer. Provan holds the club record of 284 games for St George achieved between 1951 and 1965. He played in the first ten of their run of premiership victories - as captain-coach for four - and made 30 finals appearances for the club over fifteen consecutive seasons. His last game before retirement was a victory in the 1965 Grand Final where the Dragons beat the Rabbitohs 12-8 in front 78,065 which stands as the Sydney Cricket Ground's all-time attendance record.|$|E

50|$|The Saturday {{practice}} sessions were again held in dry and sunny conditions. Michael Schumacher set the fastest {{time of the}} third session, a 1:24.262. The Williams drivers were running quickly—Jenson Button in second and Ralf Schumacher fifth—they were separated by Coulthard and Barrichello in third and fourth. Fisichella recorded the sixth fastest lap time. Villeneuve, Häkkinen, Salo and Johnny Herbert rounded out the top ten. In the final practice session, Michael Schumacher again set the fastest time, a 1:23.904; Barrichello set the third fastest time. They were separated by Häkkinen with teammate Coulthard clinching the fourth fastest time. The Williams drivers continued to run quickly with Ralf Schumacher fifth, ahead of Button in sixth. Fisichella, Zonta, Villeneuve and Irvine (who suffered a rear suspension failure but regained control of his car) completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Mazzacane again suffered problems with his car when his engine ran out of air pressure {{and was forced to}} stop on the track while Wurz did not record any laps because of a fuel pick-up issue. I must thank the team for all their efforts. It was good to be fighting my teammate for pole as it proves the car is very competitive. Obviously it is very good for the championship having us both at the front. Rubens can be a big support for me, or maybe I will be supporting him. We will have to see tomorrow. It's good to be back on the right road. I messed up my first <b>lap,</b> <b>running</b> wide at the first chicane, but the car felt quick, which is why I decided to go for a second lap, even if {{it was a bit of}} a risk. It was therefore an unusual qualifying session as I finished before the end. I must say I would rather have been in the car than sitting watching the screen. I am confident about our race set up and we have had no tyre problems. As for the first chicane at the start, it will be tight and everyone will have to be reasonable and disciplined. Michael Schumacher, commenting on taking pole position. Saturday's afternoon qualifying session lasted for one hour. Each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Michael Schumacher achieved his sixth pole position of the season, his second at Monza, with a time of 1:23.770. Although he was happy with his car and tyres, he said that he did not make the best of session because of making a mistake at the first chicane during his first run. Michael Schumacher was joined on the front row by Barrichello who recorded a lap time 0.027 seconds slower and was happy to start alongside his teammate. Häkkinen qualified third, though he believed he could have set a faster time as he struggled with the handling on his car and his McLaren misfired on his final two timed laps. Villeneuve qualified fourth, nearly half a second behind Michael Schumacher, and stated that he was happy with his performance. Häkkinen's teammate Coulthard qualified fifth and was disappointed with his starting position because he encountered traffic during the session and was blocked by Frentzen. Trulli and Frentzen set the sixth and eighth fastest times respectively for Jordan; Trulli reported no problems while Frentzen was impeded by de la Rosa. Ralf Schumacher recorded the seventh quickest time and was disappointed in his performance. De la Rosa completed the top ten fastest qualifiers. His teammate Verstappen qualified eleventh having been forced to use two of his team's cars when they developed hydraulic and engine problems. Button qualified twelfth and said he overheated his tyres after running insufficient amounts of downforce. Wurz, who qualified in 13th, used the session to familiarise himself with Benetton's spare car. He was ahead of Irvine in the faster of the two Jaguar's, who set a best time that was one-tenth of a second faster than his own teammate Johnny Herbert in 18th; both were disadvantaged at the lack of straightline speed. Salo was 15th quickest for the Sauber team, ahead of his own teammate Diniz whose car handled badly under braking. The pair were marginally quicker than Zonta who encountered gear selection problems in his race car, and switched to his team's spare monocoque. The grid was completed by Alesi and Nick Heidfeld in the Prost's who qualified in front of the Minardi's of Marc Gené and Gastón Mazzacane.|$|E
