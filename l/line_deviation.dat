Work began on regrading the North Coast line between Caboolture and Gympie in 1928 and continued until 1932. The northern section of the railway line including the tunnel was abandoned in 1932. At this time, the line was deviated east (about 600 metres south of the south portal) to its current location.

50|$|The {{momentarily}} co-moving inertial frames {{along the}} world {{line of a}} rapidly accelerating observer (center). The vertical direction indicates time, while the horizontal indicates distance, the dashed line is the spacetime trajectory ("world line") of the observer. The small dots are specific events in spacetime. If one imagines these events to be the flashing of a light, then the events that pass the two diagonal lines in {{the bottom half of}} the image (the past light cone of the observer in the origin) are the events visible to the observer. The slope of the world <b>line</b> (<b>deviation</b> from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer.

Changing {{views of}} spacetime along the world {{line of a}} rapidly {{accelerating}} observer.In this animation, the dashed line is the spacetime trajectory ("world line") of a particle. The balls are placed at regular intervals of proper time along the world line. The solid diagonal lines are the light cones for the observer's current event, and intersect at that event. The small dots are other arbitrary events in the spacetime. For the observer's current instantaneous inertial frame of reference, the vertical direction indicates {{the time and the}} horizontal direction indicates distance.The slope of the world <b>line</b> (<b>deviation</b> from being vertical) is the velocity of the particle on that section of the world line. So at a bend in the world line the particle is being accelerated. Note how the view of spacetime changes when the observer accelerates, changing the instantaneous inertial frame of reference. These changes are governed by the Lorentz transformations. Also note that:* the balls on the world line before/after future/past accelerations are more spaced out due to time dilation.* events which were simultaneous before an acceleration are at different times afterwards (due to the relativity of simultaneity),* events pass through the light cone lines due to the progression of proper time, but not due to the change of views caused by the accelerations, and* the world line always remains within the future and past light cones of the current event.|$|E

30|$|The same {{qualitative}} trend {{regarding the}} influence of the roughness on the thermal conductivity of superlattices has been reported previously for materials with diffusive behaviour, without thermal contact resistance [21]. In this case, the variation of the in-plane and cross-plane conductivities with the interfacial roughness is due to the heat flux <b>line</b> <b>deviation</b> that minimizes the heat flux path in the material that has the lower thermal conductivity. This tends to increase the cross-plane thermal conductivity. On the other hand, the increase of the roughness leads to the heat flux constrictions that decrease the in-plane thermal conductivity. The qualitative interpretation of the results shows that the thermal contact resistance of the interface has a strong influence on the superlattice thermal conductivity.|$|E

We derive the equations governing both in the conventional geometric formalism as well as using the background field method.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this paper}} is to present some {{modelling}} approaches related to a special form of advanced public transport operations and called with different names such as route <b>deviation</b> <b>line,</b> point <b>deviation</b> bus <b>line,</b> corridor <b>deviation</b> <b>line</b> and checkpoint dial-a-ride. A checkpoint dial-a-ride transit system combines characteristics both of traditional fixed route transit and of advanced door-to-door dial-a-ride service. It resembles fixed route operations because some users have to walk to and from at a finite number of stops located on a corridor and always visited. The checkpoint dial-a-ride system also resembles a door-to-door service because some users are picked up and dropped on demand at another finite number of special stops, called deviated stops or checkpoints, located near their trip ends. Such checkpoints are the main elements of a route deviation bus operations, which accepts user demands and, by communicating with a central control unit, makes the bus deviate from its regular route to serve the off-fixed-line request and then return on the regular route. Route deviation bus systems has been proposed and applied in several countries in order to enhance effectiveness of urban transit during off-peak periods, as well-suited service for small cities or as part of a larger integrated transit system. Nevertheless, mathematical modelling of problems associated to route deviation bus systems has received few research contributions. In this paper we describe some of the most recent mathematical approaches to the deviation bus route design problem. [...] Reaxys Database Information...|$|R

One {{of the major}} prerequisites for treatment success is high primary stability of the implant, which requires a high insertion torque of the implant[3] between 35 and 45 Ncm. This torque can be reliably generated by choosing patients with sufficient bone quality and quantity, adequately sized implants and surfaces, and using a minimally traumatic surgical technique. [2, 3] However, successful immediate loading may be jeopardized by masticatory overloading and infection. [3] The prosthesis must have good marginal adaptation and passivity.

40|$|We {{postulated}} that the lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV) {{can be determined}} based on the apical vertebra. Seventy-two Lenke type 1 patients (average age: 13. 6  years) receiving posterior spinal fusion were randomised into two groups.

Posteroanterior and lateral standing radiographs were used to assess flexibility, Cobb angle and distance from the C 7 line to the central sacral vertical line.

40|$|As a {{new type}} Fourier {{transform}} imaging spectrometry, large aperture static imaging spectrometry (LASIS) has come forth in recent years, which has many advantages such as simple principle, high stability and so on. However, the requirement for the optical system design of LASIS was very harsh. As one of the optical aberrations, optical distortion degrades the data quality acquired by LASIS, consequently limits its applications. According {{to the analysis of}} the data acquisition principle of LASIS, the data model with the effect of optical distortion was presented, which could be used for LASIS performance pre-evaluation. Finally, the computer simlulation of the data model was achieved with supposed parameters. The simulation results indicated that the relative error more than 5 % was induced in the recovery spectrum, and approximate 8 nm spectral <b>line</b> <b>deviation</b> was occurred at the long wavelength region.

In the high-latitude tail the {{magnetic field}} lines systematically diverge in both longitudinal (east-west) and latitudinal (north-south) directions; the divergence angle between field lines near the dusk flank and those near the dawn flank is about 14 deg, but the divergence along the Z direction is only about 8 deg. The degree of divergence is found to be greater in the evening side than in the morning side and greater in the northern tail than in the southern tail.

Unfortunately, such lenses demonstrate highly expressed radial distortion, thus image has to be corrected before it could be used for estimation the subject’s dimensions. There are number of methods, proposed to correct lens radial distortion. Most of them use deviation of the imaged straight line from the real straight line as a criterion for image correction. Correction parameters are adjusted to minimize the deviation. This paper demonstrates, that such criterion does not guarantee that error of dimensions measurements will be minimal as well. In the present work, various radial distortion correction methods, including one, introduced by authors, were evaluated, using both straight <b>line</b> <b>deviation</b> and dimension measurement error.

This approach significantly improves the skew estimation time and accuracy. The time improvement comes from the training that need be performed only once on the training images rather than the repetitive process for each image of previous algorithms.
