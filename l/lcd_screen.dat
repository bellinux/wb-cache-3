40|$|BackgroundWe {{hypothesize that}} {{mortality}} risk profile of participants and nonparticipants in nonrandomized lung cancer (<b>LC)</b> <b>screening</b> of smokers may be different. MethodsIn 1997, a population-based cohort of 5815 smokers of Varese Province {{was invited to}} nonrandomized <b>LC</b> <b>screening</b> by annual chest x-ray examination for 4 years. LC risk factors and screening participation rate were recorded. Except for screening, the whole cohort received usual care. After 9. 5 -year observation, we compared mortality of participants versus nonparticipants by assessing age-standardized all-cause mortality rate ratio (MRR) and disease group-specific MRR with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). ResultsSelf-selected screening participants were 21 % of cohort. Participants were younger (p < 0. 001), were more frequently current smokers (p = 0. 019), had more pack-years of smoking (p < 0. 0001), and had higher rate of LC family history (p < 0. 0001) and of occupational LC risk (p < 0. 0001) relative to nonparticipants. In logistic regression analysis familial LC, occupational risk and pack-years smoked were significant predictors of participation in screening and of developing LC. Participants displayed a healthy effect, as shown by all-cause MRR = 0. 67 (95 % CI, 0. 53 – 0. 84), all cancers except LC MRR = 0. 61 (95 % CI, 0. 41 – 0. 91), cardiovascular diseases MRR = 0. 38 (95 % CI, 0. 22 – 0. 63), and noncancer disease other than cardiovascular or respiratory MRR = 0. 57 (95 % CI, 0. 34 – 0. 92). The LC mortality (MRR = 1. 40; 95 % CI, 1. 03 – 1. 91) was higher in participants relative to nonparticipants (p = 0. 031). ConclusionThe selection effect in <b>LC</b> <b>screening</b> participants was dual: healthy effect and higher LC mortality.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) {{demonstrated}} that low-dose computed tomography screening {{is an effective}} way of reducing lung cancer (LC) mortality. However, optimal screening strategies have not been determined to date and it is uncertain whether lighter smokers than those examined in the NLST may also benefit from screening. To address these questions, {{it is necessary to}} first develop LC natural history models that can reproduce NLSToutcomes and simulate screening programs at the population level. METHODS: Five independent <b>LC</b> <b>screening</b> models were developed using common inputs and calibration targets derived from the NLST and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). Imputation of missing information regarding smoking, histology, and stage of disease for a small percentage of individuals and diagnosed LCs in both trials was performed. Mod-els were calibrated to LC incidence, mortality, or both outcomes simultaneously. RESULTS: Initially, all models were calibrated to the NLST and validated against PLCO. Models were found to validate well against individuals in PLCO who would have been eligible for the NLST. However, all models required further calibration to PLCO to adequately capture LC outcomes in PLCO never-smokers and light smokers. Final versions of all models produced incidence and mortality outcomes in the presence and absence of screening that were consistent with both trials. CONCLUSIONS: The authors developed 5 distinct <b>LC</b> <b>screening</b> simulation models based on the evi-dence in the NLST and PLCO. The results of their analyses {{demonstrated that}} the NLST and PLCO have produced consistent results. The resulting models can be important tools to generate additional evidence to determine the effectiveness of lung cancer screenin...|$|R

40|$|Background. After the {{implementation}} of a population- based programme of chest x-ray (CXR) screening on smokers in Varese, Italy, lung cancer (LC) mortality was significantly reduced. Analysis of the incremental costs due to this type of screening programme is needed to evaluate its economic impact on the healthcare system. Methods. In July 1997 a population-based cohort, consisting of all high-risk smokers (n= 5, 815) identified among 60, 000 adult residents from the Varese province, was invited to a <b>LC</b> <b>screening</b> programme (an annual CXR for five years) in a general practice setting, and was observed through 2006. Invitees received National Health Service (NHS) usual care, with the addition of CXRs in screening participants. At the end of observation, among the 245 LCs diagnosed in the entire screening-invited cohort the observed LC deaths were 38 fewer than expected. To estimate the incremental direct cost due to screening in the invited cohort for the period July 1997 - 2006, we compared the direct cost of screening administration, CXR <b>screens</b> and <b>LC</b> management in the invited cohort and in the uninvited and unscreened controls in NHS usual care setting. Results. Over the 9. 5 years, the total incremental direct healthcare costs (including screening organization/administration, CXR screens, additional procedures prompted by false-positive tests, overdiagnosed LCs) were estimated to range from € 607, 440 to € 618, 370 (in euros as of 2012), equating to between € 15, 985 - € 16, 273 per patient out of the 38 LC deaths averted.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Chronic {{respiratory}} conditions, especially chronic obstructive {{pulmonary disease}} (COPD), and inflammatory events underlie lung cancer (LC). We hypothesized that profiles of T helper 1 and T helper 2 cytokines and type 1 and type 2 macrophages (M 1 and M 2) are differentially expressed in lung tumors and blood {{of patients with}} NSCLC with and without COPD and that the ratio M 1 /M 2 specifically may influence their survival. METHODS: In blood, inflammatory cytokines (determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were quantified in 80 patients with LC (60 with LC and COPD [the LC-COPD group] and 20 with LC only [the LC-only group]) and lung specimens (tumor and nontumor) from those undergoing thoracotomy (20 in the LC-COPD group and 20 in the LC-only group). RESULTS: In the LC-COPD group compared with in the LC-only group, systemic levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), transforming growth factor-β, and IL- 10 were increased, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor and IL- 4 levels were decreased. In lung tumors, levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, and IL- 10 were higher than in nontumor parenchyma in the LC-COPD group, whereas IL- 2 and vascular endothelial growth factor levels were higher in tumors of both the LC-only and LC-COPD groups. Compared with in nontumor lung, M 1 macrophage counts were reduced whereas M 2 counts were increased in tumors of both patient groups, and the M 1 /M 2 ratio was higher in the LC-COPD group than the LC-only group. M 1 and M 2 counts did not influence patients' survival. CONCLUSIONS: The relative predominance of T helper 1 cytokines and M 1 macrophages in the blood and tumors of patients with underlying COPD imply that a stronger proinflammatory pattern exists in these patients. Inflammation should not be targeted systematically in all patients with <b>LC.</b> <b>Screening</b> for the presence of underlying respiratory diseases and identification of the specific inflammatory pattern should be carried out in patients with LC, at least in early stages of their disease.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of long fibre concentration on loadability and pulp properties during LC refining of mechanical pulp. Long fibre concentration was adjusted to three different levels by screen fractionation of the pulp. The three pulps were refined in a single disc pilot scale LC refiner at similar process conditions. Increased long fibre concentration supported a larger refiner gap and resulted in less fibre cutting at a given specific energy consumption. The higher long fibre concentration probably contributed to a stronger fibre network that maintained a larger refining gap at certain specific energy consumption. Increased long fibre concentration also enabled a higher tensile index increase in the LC refiner at certain fibre length reduction. The study supports a process combining <b>LC</b> refining with <b>screen</b> fractionation, where the long fibre fraction is recycled to the refiner feed.

40|$|Abstract Background Psychological {{distress}} {{is common}} in cancer survivors. Although {{there is some evidence}} on effectiveness of psychosocial care in distressed cancer patients, referral rate is low. Lack of adequate screening instruments in oncology settings and insufficient availability of traditional models of psychosocial care are the main barriers. A stepped care approach has the potential to improve the efficiency of psychosocial care. The aim of the study described herein is to evaluate efficacy of a stepped care strategy targeting psychological distress in cancer survivors. Methods/design The study is designed as a randomized clinical trial with 2 treatment arms: a stepped care intervention programme versus care as usual. Patients treated for head and neck cancer (HNC) or lung cancer (<b>LC)</b> are <b>screened</b> for distress using OncoQuest, a computerized touchscreen system. After stratification for tumour (HNC vs. LC) and stage (stage I/II vs. III/IV), 176 distressed patients are randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Patients in the intervention group will follow a stepped care model with 4 evidence based steps: 1. Watchful waiting, 2. Guided self-help via Internet or a booklet, 3. Problem Solving Treatment administered by a specialized nurse, and 4. Specialized psychological intervention or antidepressant medication. In the control group, patients receive care as usual which most often is a single interview or referral to specialized intervention. Primary outcome is the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Secondary outcome measures are a clinical level of depression or anxiety (CIDI), quality of life (EQ- 5 D, EORTC QLQ-C 30, QLQ-HN 35, QLQ-LC 13), patient satisfaction with care (EORTC QLQ-PATSAT), and costs (health care utilization and work loss (TIC-P and PRODISQ modules)). Outcomes are evaluated before and after intervention and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 [*]months after intervention. Discussion Stepped care is a system of delivering and monitoring treatments, such that effective, yet least resource-intensive, treatment is delivered to patients first. The main aim of a stepped care approach is to simplify the patient pathway, provide access to more patients and to improve patient well-being and cost reduction by directing, where appropriate, patients to low cost (self-) management before high cost specialist services.

40|$|Natural {{products}} chemistry {{has witnessed}} many {{new developments in}} the last 5 years like extractions with subcritical water and ionic liquids, LC/HRMS and LC/SPE/cryo-NMR, UHPLC, TLC/MS, MS-based preparative HPLC, comprehensive chromatography (GC × GC, LC × <b>LC),</b> high-throughput <b>screening,</b> introduction of monolithic columns, miniaturisation, and automated structure identification. Nevertheless identifying bioactive constituents in complex plant extracts remains a tedious process. The classical approach of bioassay guided fractionation is time-consuming while off-line screening of extracts does not provide information on individual compounds and sometimes suffers from false positives or negatives. One way out of this is by coupling chromatography with chemical or biochemical assays, so called high resolution screening. An example is the development of HPLC on-line assays for antioxidants. By the post-column addition of a relatively stable coloured radical like DPPH¿ or ABTS¿+, radical scavengers are detected as negative peaks because in a reaction coil they reduce the model radical to its reduced, non-coloured form. When combined with LC/DAD/MS and LC/SPE/NMR, reliable identification of active constituents becomes possible without the necessity of ever isolating them in a classical sense. Also for finding leads for new drugs, combining HPLC with biochemical assays is interesting but technically more difficult. Most enzymes do not work at the organic modifier concentrations commonly encountered in RP-HPLC and the reaction time is often longer requiring dilution and lengthy coils respectively. Therefore, new techniques have to be implemented to gain the required sensitivity for on-line enzyme assays. For stable analytes, high temperature LC offers a solution to the organic modifier problem. When enzymes are highly expensive, like those used in the screening for Cytochrome P 450 inhibitors, miniaturisation to chip format may offer a way out. Microreactors (chips) are not only useful for miniaturising larger assays but also offer completely new prospects in phytochemical analysis. One such application is in the sample clean-up of acids and bases like alkaloids. In a lay-out of three parallel channels of 100 ¿m width with the middle one containing organic phase and the two outer ones water of high pH (feed phase) and low pH (trapping phase) such a chip replaces two classical LLE steps but is much faster and requires less solvents and less manpower input...|$|R

Although {{there is some evidence}} on effectiveness of psychosocial care in distressed cancer patients, referral rate is low. Lack of adequate screening instruments in oncology settings and insufficient availability of traditional models of psychosocial care are the main barriers. A stepped care approach has the potential to improve the efficiency of psychosocial care. The aim of the study described herein is to evaluate efficacy of a stepped care strategy targeting psychological distress in cancer survivors. Methods/design: The study is designed as a randomized clinical trial with 2 treatment arms: a stepped care intervention programme versus care as usual. Patients treated for head and neck cancer (HNC) or lung cancer (<b>LC)</b> are <b>screened</b> for distress using OncoQuest, a computerized touchscreen system. After stratification for tumour (HNC vs. LC) and stage (stage I/II vs. III/IV), 176 distressed patients are randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Patients in the intervention group will follow a stepped care model with 4 evidence based steps: 1. Watchful waiting, 2. Guided self-help via Internet or a booklet, 3. Problem Solving Treatment administered by a specialized nurse, and 4. Specialized psychological intervention or antidepressant medication. In the control group, patients receive care as usual which most often is a single interview or referral to specialized intervention. Primary outcome is the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Secondary outcome measures are a clinical level of depression or anxiety (CIDI), quality of life (EQ- 5 D, EORTC QLQ-C 30, QLQ-HN 35, QLQ-LC 13), patient satisfaction with care (EORTC QLQ-PATSAT), and costs (health care utilization and work loss (TIC-P and PRODISQ modules)). Outcomes are evaluated before and after intervention and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after intervention. Discussion: Stepped care is a system of delivering and monitoring treatments, such that effective, yet least resource-intensive, treatment is delivered to patients first. The main aim of a stepped care approach is to simplify the patient pathway, provide access to more patients and to improve patient well-being and cost reduction by directing, where appropriate, patients to low cost (self-) management before high cost specialist services.

40|$|The extraocular muscles (EOMs) are {{a unique}} group of muscles that are anatomically and physiologically {{distinct}} from other muscles. We {{and others have}} shown that EOMs have a unique transcriptome and proteome. Here we investigated the expression pattern of microRNAs (miRNAs), as they {{may play a role}} in generating the unique EOM allotype. We isolated RNA and <b>screened</b> <b>LC</b> Sciences miRNA microarrays covering the sequences of miRBase 10. 0 to define the microRNAome of normal mouse EOM and tibialis anterior (TA) limb muscle. Seventy-four miRNAs were found to be differentially regulated (P value 500. Muscle-specific miRNAs miR- 206 and miR- 499 were upregulated and miR- 1, miR- 133 a, and miR- 133 b were downregulated in EOM. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was used to validate the differential expression. Bioinformatic tools were used to identify potential miRNA-mRNA-protein interactions and integrate data with previous transcriptome and proteomic profiling data. Luciferase assays using cotransfection of precursor miRNAs with reporter constructs containing the 3 ′-untranslated region of predicted target genes were used to validate targeting by identified miRNAs. The definition of the EOM microRNAome complements existing transcriptome and proteome data about the molecular makeup of EOM and provides further insight into regulation of muscle genes. These data will also help to further explain the unique EOM muscle allotype and its differential sensitivity to diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and may assist in development of therapeutic strategies...|$|R
