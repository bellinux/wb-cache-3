5|$|Virginia Tech's win <b>lifted</b> <b>it</b> {{to a final}} {{record of}} 93, while Alabama's loss dropped it to 75. In the final college {{football}} polls of the season, Virginia Tech was ranked 19th in the coaches' poll and 23rd in the AP Poll, while Alabama remained unranked. The 387 win remains Virginia Tech's biggest bowl-game win.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the trophy}} {{was held by}} 1938 winners Italy. Ottorino Barassi, the Italian {{vice-president}} of FIFA and president of FIGC, secretly transported the trophy from a bank in Rome and hid it in a shoe-box under his bed to prevent Adolf Hitler and the Nazis from taking it. The 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden {{marked the beginning of}} a tradition regarding the trophy. As Brazilian captain Hilderaldo Bellini heard photographer requests for a better view of the Jules Rimet Trophy, he <b>lifted</b> <b>it</b> up in the air. Every Cup-winning captain ever since has repeated the gesture.|$|E
5|$|Testing of {{cosmetic}} products on animals is {{banned in the}} member states of the European Community, although France protested the ban and has made efforts to have it <b>lifted.</b> <b>It</b> is permitted in the United States but is not mandatory if safety can be ascertained by other methods, and the test species is not specified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and some drugs and chemicals the FDA uses beagles and miniature pigs as surrogates for direct human testing. Minnesota was {{the first state to}} enact a Beagle freedom adoption law in 2014, mandating that dogs and cats are allowed to be adopted once they have completed with research testing.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's win <b>lifted</b> <b>it</b> {{to a final}} {{record of}} 102, while Texas' loss dropped it to a record of 1021. Tech {{improved}} to 36 in bowl games, while Texas fell to 17172. As {{a result of the}} win, Tech jumped to No. 10 in the final AP Poll of the year and No. 9 in the final coaches' poll of the year. Texas fell to No. 14 in both final polls. A large portion of Virginia Tech's bowl-game proceeds were devoted toward improving athletic facilities at the school, and more money was generated by a boom in merchandise sales that followed the game. Texas saw a similar but smaller boom in merchandise sales.|$|E

25|$|The 2007 Brooklyn tornado {{hit this}} area, {{specifically}} 68th Street and Bay Ridge Avenue between Third and Fourth Avenues. Eleven houses {{had to be}} vacated after they suffered significant damage, {{and many of the}} trees on the two blocks toppled, landing on cars and stoops. The 4th Avenue Presbyterian Church had its very large stained glass window blown out. As the tornado <b>lifted,</b> <b>it</b> peeled the roof of a nearby Nissan dealership and deforested 40% of Leif Ericson Park. The tornado has been rated an EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, with winds between 111 and 135 MPH.|$|E
25|$|La Liga {{had another}} good outing in the 2001 Champions League, with Real Madrid and Valencia again {{reaching}} the semi-finals. Valencia {{returned to the}} Final again in the 2001 only to lose again. The winner this time was Bayern Munich, who had earlier ousted defending champions Real Madrid in the semi-finals. That match ended 1–1 and Bayern won the shoot-out 5–4. That win also gave coach Ottmar Hitzfeld the distinction of winning the European Cup with two different teams, having <b>lifted</b> <b>it</b> in 1997 with Borussia Dortmund. Valencia had now lost two Champions League finals in a row.|$|E
25|$|Although {{humans and}} animals are not {{traditionally}} seen as interchangeable, there are diachronical notions of unity between human and animal: imaginations about an ancient time when the animal could take on human form at will — it simply raised its forearm or wing to its face and <b>lifted</b> <b>it</b> aside at the muzzle or beak, like a mask. Ceremonies may help preserve this ancient unity: a masked person represents the animal and, as s/he lifts the mask, the human existence of that animal appears. Masks among Alaskan Natives could serve several functions. There are also transformation masks reflecting the mentioned unity between human and animal.|$|E

25|$|An {{advance on}} the basic design was the iron ploughshare, a {{replaceable}} horizontal cutting surface mounted {{on the tip of}} the share. The earliest ploughs with a detachable and replaceable share date from around 1000 BC in the Ancient Near East, and the earliest iron ploughshares from ca. 500 BC in China. Early mouldboards were basically wedges that sat inside the cut formed by the coulter, turning over the soil to the side. The ploughshare spread the cut horizontally below the surface, so when the mouldboard <b>lifted</b> <b>it,</b> a wider area of soil was turned over. Mouldboards are known in Britain from the late 6th century on.|$|E
25|$|Then on 1 October Owen Glendower, with Persian in company, was escorting {{a convoy}} off The Lizard in thick fog.

When the fog <b>lifted,</b> <b>it</b> {{turned out that the}} cutter was only a short distance away. The cutter did not surrender until a short cannonade wounded several of her crew. She {{turned out to be the}} 16 or 20-gun Indomptable, out of Roscoff, with a crew of 120 or 130 men. She had formerly been the Revenue Cutter Swan, out of Cowes. Selby retook Roden.|$|E
25|$|Federal {{investigations}} {{during the}} 1970s and 1980s charged Cohn three times with professional misconduct, including perjury and witness tampering. He was accused in New York of financial improprieties related to city contracts and private investments. He {{was acquitted of}} all charges. In 1986, a five-judge panel of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court disbarred Cohn for unethical and unprofessional conduct, including misappropriation of clients' funds, lying on a bar application, and pressuring a client to amend his will. In this case in 1975, Cohn entered the hospital room of a dying and comatose Lewis Rosenstiel, the multi-millionaire founder of Schenley Industries, forced a pen to his hand and <b>lifted</b> <b>it</b> to the will {{in an attempt to}} make himself and Cathy Frank—Rosenstiel's granddaughter—beneficiaries. The resulting marks were determined in court to be indecipherable and in no way a valid signature.|$|E

25|$|Loch Vennachar was {{considered}} an unlucky ship narrowly surviving a cyclone in the Indian Ocean in June 1892. Around 8pm on 3 June, the barometer began to fall ominously and the sail was promptly shortened. At approximately 5.00am as darkness <b>lifted</b> <b>it</b> showed terrific head seas that swept down upon the vessel, lashed by the North-East gale. Two large waves approached the ship. Loch Vennachar rode the first wave and sank into the trough at the other side. While in this position, the second wave came on and broke on deck {{with such force that}} it broke the foremast, mainmast and the mizzen topmast. Without her masts to steady her, the Loch Vennachar rolled dangerously in heavy seas. After 9 days, the weather eased and the crew were able to rig a spar forward and sail on the damaged mizzen. After 5 weeks of sailing, she arrived at Port Louis, Mauritius. Although her stay lasted 5 months while new spars were sent from England, repairs only took 10 days to complete. Captain Bennett was awarded the Lloyd's Medal for his leadership and bravery at sea.|$|E
25|$|Talbot {{struck again}} at 10:07 in the period, as he curled the puck to fake a pass during a two-on-one break, then <b>lifted</b> <b>it</b> over Osgood's shoulder. The play began with Chris Kunitz {{splitting}} the Detroit defence with a pass {{in his own}} zone, allowing Talbot and Tyler Kennedy to move in on an odd man rush. The Penguins attempted to play conservatively {{in the third period}} and registered only one shot in the frame. At the same time, Detroit was able to sustain pressure on several occasions during the period. At 13:53, the Red Wings got on the board, as Jonathan Ericsson drilled a one-timed slapshot behind Fleury from near the blue line, after receiving a pass from Niklas Lidstrom. Then, at 17:45, Detroit came within inches of pulling into a tie. However, Niklas Kronwall's wristshot from the right circle ricocheted off of Jordan Staal, hit the crossbar, then bounced away from any Red Wing skaters. Detroit gained one last chance on the final shift of the game. After stopping an initial Henrik Zetterberg shot from the right faceoff circle, the rebound came loose to Nicklas Lidstrom at the left faceoff circle, forcing Fleury to make a diving stop with two seconds remaining to preserve the win and the championship. Pittsburgh's Evgeni Malkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy after the game as the Most Valuable Player of the 2009 playoffs, becoming the first Russian born player to win the trophy.|$|E
