5|$|However, {{no other}} journal {{reviewed}} {{the book and}} Thoughts was not reprinted until the late 20th century, {{when there was a}} resurgence of interest in Wollstonecraft among feminist <b>literary</b> <b>critics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Heyer {{frequently}} {{highlights the}} heroine's many masculine qualities, {{which include a}} fierce independence and a disregard for social mores. Modern <b>literary</b> <b>critics</b> have noted {{that the relationship between}} the protagonists is modelled on those of the latter 20th century, offering companionship and allowing both parties to retain a level of independence. The heroine's unwillingness to conform attracts the hero, rather than repels him.|$|E

50|$|He {{wrote for}} the France Observateur as a <b>literary</b> <b>critic</b> {{beginning}} in 1961. Retaining his position as <b>literary</b> <b>critic</b> for the Nouvel Observateur in 1964, he is also literary adviser for Denoël.|$|R
5|$|Inspired by the author's {{participation}} in the Allied bombing of the monastery at Monte Cassino during World War II, the novel is considered a masterpiece by <b>literary</b> <b>critics.</b> It has been compared favorably with the works of Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene, and Walker Percy, and its themes of religion, recurrence, and church versus state have generated a significant body of scholarly research.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} postmodern novels, Fowles uses {{multiple}} different stylistic and structural techniques to highlight his thematic interests in The French Lieutenant's Woman. When discussing these stylistic concerns, many <b>literary</b> <b>critics</b> {{comment on the}} importance of the narrator and the narration, the intertextual references to other literary works, and the multiple endings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Literary</b> <b>critics</b> {{received}} Rand's fiction {{with mixed}} reviews, and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest {{has increased in}} recent decades. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both {{to the public and}} in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.|$|E
50|$|The {{positive}} reviews {{about the}} book appeared in the Ukrainian magazine for culture and literature “Yi” («Ї») by sociologist, writer and <b>literary</b> <b>critic</b> Volodymyr Shelukhin and in newspaper “Litforum” by Roman Kukharuk, writer and <b>literary</b> <b>critic.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{cultural}} icon, Nancy Drew {{is cited}} as a formative influence {{by a number of}} women, from Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Sonia Sotomayor to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former First Lady Laura Bush. Feminist <b>literary</b> <b>critics</b> have analyzed the character's enduring appeal, arguing variously that Nancy Drew is a mythic hero, an expression of wish fulfillment, or an embodiment of contradictory ideas about femininity.|$|E
5|$|In late 1888 he {{finished}} {{work on a}} fourth book, Pipes o' Pan at Zekesbury which was released to great acclaim in the United States. Based on a fictional town in Indiana, Riley presented many stories and poems about its citizens and way of life. It received mixed reviews among <b>literary</b> <b>critics</b> who wrote of it that Riley's stories were not of the same quality as his poetry. The book was very popular with the public and went through numerous reprints.|$|E
5|$|Simon & Schuster {{released}} The Firebrand on October 1, 1987 in hardcover, and it {{was issued}} in paperback in September 1988. The Firebrand has been overshadowed by the popularity of The Mists of Avalon, receiving less attention and critical praise. Reviews of the book ranged from mixed to positive, with many <b>literary</b> <b>critics</b> praising Bradley's ability to give new characterizations to legendary figures. It has been translated into at least twelve languages, beginning with Portuguese and French in 1989.|$|E

5|$|The {{nominations}} for the award are received from various literary experts, teachers, critics, universities, and numerous literary and language associations. Every three years, {{an advisory committee}} is constituted {{for each of the}} languages. The language of the most recent recipient's work is not eligible for consideration for the next two years. Each committee consists of three <b>literary</b> <b>critics</b> and scholars of their respective languages. All the nominations are scrutinised by the committee and their recommendations are submitted to the Jnanpith Award Selection Board (Pravara Parishad).|$|E
5|$|According to the <b>literary</b> <b>critics</b> Maman S. Mahayana, Oyon Sofyan, and Achmad Dian, Hasan's {{psychological}} struggles reflect Sigmund Freud's {{theories on}} psychoanalysis. Teeuw notes that Hasan {{comes across as}} being disappointed that his traditional religious upbringing {{is not enough to}} overcome the temptations of the modern world. Poet and critic of Indonesian literature Muhammad Balfas writes that Hasan's conflict arises from being torn intellectually between the teachings of his ultra-religious father and the Marxist Rusli, {{while at the same time}} being emotionally victimised by the ever self-confident Anwar. Balfas notes that three versions of Hasan are made apparent to the reader: Hasan's view of himself, the narrator's view of Hasan, and the narrator's reconstruction of Hasan.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's work became {{increasingly}} controversial among <b>literary</b> <b>critics,</b> {{teachers and parents}} from the 1950s onwards, because of the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and the themes of her books, particularly the Noddy series. Some libraries and schools banned her works, which the BBC had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they were perceived to lack literary merit. Her books have been criticised as being elitist, sexist, racist, xenophobic and {{at odds with the}} more liberal environment emerging in post-war Britain, but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968.|$|E

5|$|Feminist <b>literary</b> <b>critics</b> see {{the poem}} as portraying women's {{ultimate}} power over men. Morgan le Fay and Bertilak's wife, for example, {{are the most}} powerful characters in the poem—Morgan especially, as she begins the game by enchanting the Green Knight. The girdle and Gawain's scar {{can be seen as}} symbols of feminine power, each of them diminishing Gawain's masculinity. Gawain's misogynist passage, in which he blames all of his troubles on women and lists the many men who have fallen prey to women's wiles, further supports the feminist view of ultimate female power in the poem.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish Academy {{chose the}} poet Sully Prudhomme {{for the first}} Nobel Prize in Literature. A group {{including}} 42 Swedish writers, artists, and <b>literary</b> <b>critics</b> protested against this decision, having expected Leo Tolstoy to be awarded. Some, including Burton Feldman, have criticised this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet. Feldman's explanation {{is that most of}} the Academy members preferred Victorian literature and thus selected a Victorian poet. The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist Emil von Behring. During the 1890s, von Behring developed an antitoxin to treat diphtheria, which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year.|$|E
5|$|The Thraliana was a diary kept by Hester Thrale and {{is part of}} {{the genre}} known as table talk. Although the work began as Thrale's diary focused on her {{experience}} with her family, it slowly changed focus to emphasise various anecdotes and stories about the life of Samuel Johnson. The work was used as a basis for Thrale's Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson, but the Thraliana remained unpublished until 1942. The anecdotes contained within the work were popular with Thrale's contemporaries but seen as vulgar. Among 20th century readers, the work was popular, and many <b>literary</b> <b>critics</b> believe that the work is a valuable contribution to the genre and for providing information about Johnson's and her own life.|$|E

5|$|The nascent magazine, {{under the}} {{editorial}} control of Armijn and Alisjahbana, was initially poorly received by {{political parties and}} actors; they considered the magazine, which was generally non-political, liable to weaken the nationalist movement by diverting it into less important areas. To guarantee better support, {{people who were not}} writers or <b>literary</b> <b>critics</b> were accepted onto the editorial board. The first, Sumadang, was accepted in 1935. Other politicians involved during the end of the 1930s included Amir Sjarifuddin, Mohamad Sjah, and Sugiarti. During this period the magazine began to have a wider scope.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately for Brian, {{when his}} novel is released, it is universally panned by <b>literary</b> <b>critics</b> {{and does not}} sell a single copy. Brian laments that he sacrificed his core beliefs for nothing, but Lois {{intervenes}} because he helped ban cannabis (and she also points out how Stewie got to build a nice fort from all of Brian's unsold books). A distraught Quagmire arrives at the household and informs Peter that he is still looking for James and offers a reward of $50. Peter nonchalantly takes the reward, admits that he killed him and slams his door before Quagmire {{has a chance to}} react.|$|E
5|$|According to Packer, {{another common}} theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices {{ordinary}} {{people who live}} in oppressive regimes are forced to make. <b>Literary</b> <b>critics</b> Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises that whites are not always welcome in the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: to have a life of her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E
