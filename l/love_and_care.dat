5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of {{separation}} from the mother is characteristic of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's {{separation from the}} care of the mother, but with an emotional attachment between mother and child which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from the birth mother and adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth and even if the adoptive family provides all possible <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>care.</b> These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E

25|$|Sex is not {{considered}} acceptable outside marriage, {{but it is an}} important part of the <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>care</b> shown between partners. Sexual relations are forbidden during the time of the woman's period. After her period has ended, she will go to the mikveh (the ritual immersion pool) where she will fully immerse herself and become ritually clean again. Sexual relations may then resume. Married couples need to find other ways of expressing their love for each other during these times, and some say that the time of abstention enhances the relationship.|$|E

25|$|Typically, {{older men}} and women {{maintaining}} interest in sexual interest and activity could be therapeutic; {{it is a way}} of expressing their <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>care</b> for one another. Factors such as biological and psychological factors, diseases, mental conditions, boredom with the relationship, and widowhood have been found to contribute with the common decrease in sexual interest and activity in old age. National sex surveys given in Finland in the 1990s revealed aging men had a higher incidence of sexual intercourse compared to aging women and that women were more likely to report a lack of sexual desire compared to men. Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity. Both aging genders agreed they needed good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a sexually skilful partner to maintain sexual desire.|$|E

25|$|His catechetical lectures (Greek Κατηχήσεις) are {{generally}} assumed, {{on the basis}} of limited evidence, to have been delivered either in Cyril's early years as a bishop, around 350, or perhaps in 348, while Cyril was still a priest, deputising for his bishop, Maximus. The Catechetical Lectures were given in the Martyrion, the basilica erected by Constantine. They contain instructions on the principal topics of Christian faith and practice, in rather a popular than a scientific manner, full of a warm pastoral <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>care</b> for the catechumens to whom they were delivered. Each lecture is based upon a text of Scripture, and there is an abundance of Scriptural quotation throughout. In the Catechetical Lectures, parallel with the exposition of the Creed as it was then received in the Church of Jerusalem are vigorous polemics against pagan, Jewish, and heretical errors. They are of great importance for the light which they throw upon the method of instruction usual of that age, as well as upon the liturgical practises of the period, of which they give the fullest account extant.|$|E

He did become sort of a boy toy in both worlds. But, you know, {{at the end of}} the day, in Storybrooke, she’s still trying to fill this void that Maleficent warned her about." [...] Leading up to the episode broadcast, Parrilla also gave a preview of what viewers could expect. Of the episode's plot, she explained, [...] "We will be seeing some dirty politics between Regina and Mr. Gold. You’re going to see how threatening that is to Regina, and, as you know, she really takes on these challenges full force." ...|$|E

But Brenda has the humour and the heart to show the amount of <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>care</b> Mrs Bennet has for her daughters." [...] Wright convinced veteran actress Judi Dench to join the cast as Lady Catherine de Bourgh by writing her a letter that read [...] "I love it when you play a bitch. Please come and be a bitch for me." [...] Dench had only one week available to shoot her scenes, forcing Wright to make them his first days of filming.|$|E

500|$|... {{about one-third}} of the population, or 1.5million people, lived in 3,500unregistered squatter-occupied and 2,011registered slums. The {{authorised}} slums (with access to basic services like water, latrines, trash removal by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation) can be broadly divided into two groups—bustees, in which slum dwellers have some long term tenancy agreement with the landowners; and udbastu colonies, settlements which had been leased to refugees from present-day Bangladesh by the Government. The unauthorised slums (devoid of basic services provided by the municipality) are occupied by squatters who started living on encroached lands—mainly along canals, railway lines and roads. According to the 2005 National Family Health Survey, around 14% of the households in Kolkata were poor, while 33% lived in slums, indicating a substantial proportion of households in slum areas were better off economically than the bottom quarter of urban households in terms of wealth status. Mother Teresa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for founding and working with the Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata—an organisation [...] "whose primary task was to <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>care</b> for those persons nobody was prepared to look after".|$|E

They're doing this job for next to nothing and do it with such <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>care...</b> I couldn't do it, I'd get too emotionally involved, I don't think I could cope." [...] In 2001, Kensit had made a guest appearance in series 16 of Holby City sister show Casualty, appearing as a domestic abuse victim and giving what TV critic Ian Hyland deemed [...] "a convincing performance". Prior to her move into television roles, Kensit had predominantly worked in films, but explained upon joining the cast of Holby City: [...] "Making films isn't for me any more because I'm an old girl in that world ... I've been very lucky, this is something I grew up doing, in television there's so much satisfaction ... I'll stay as long as they want me, I feel like I've come back home." ...|$|E

[...] The same Pope wrote {{on the occasion of}} the World Day of Peace, January 1, 1990, the saint of Assisi [...] "offers Christians an example of genuine and deep respect for the integrity of creation ..." [...] He went on to make the point that: [...] "As a friend of the poor who was loved by God's creatures, Saint Francis invited all of creation – animals, plants, natural forces, even Brother Sun and Sister Moon – to give honor and praise to the Lord. The poor man of Assisi gives us striking witness that when we are at peace with God we are better able to devote ourselves to building up that peace with all creation which is inseparable from peace among all peoples." ...|$|E

Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four, describing it as [...] "a beautiful, thrilling, joyous, surprising, and heart-thumping adventure".

Or the alley Kat that we got last year (Kat down the alley with delivery man Mark was not her finest moment). Now with the reveal that she'll have a mystery that we can all spend weeks or months trying to guess , we fear it will be more alley Kat." [...] All About Soap thought that because of the way Kat got rid of Roxy after she moved in with Alfie while Kat was away, [...] "you'd think that [...] Kat was really committed to her husband [...] and determined to make her marriage work" [...] but called the affair [...] "sizzling", saying it would [...] "send shockwaves all round Albert Square!" [...] Soaplife said that the storyline {{may turn out to be}} a good mystery, but [...] "when it comes to affairs, we prefer ours with a heap-big dose of love".

Yes, it's a bit annoying when your other half is too busy to pay you much attention—but there should at least be an effort to sort out your issues before you decide cheating is the answer! We're finding it hard to have sympathy". The magazine later called the storyline [...] "unusual" [...] but said that [...] "Kat has been busy showing us how infidelity should be done".
