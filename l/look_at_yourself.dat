500|$|... "Bad" [...] was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} duet between Jackson and musician Prince. Other artists {{that were supposed to}} be featured on the album included Diana Ross, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin and Barbra Streisand, but none of those collaborations ended up happening. The song was viewed as a revived [...] "Hit the Road, Jack" [...] progression with lyrics that pertain to 'boasting'. [...] "Dirty Diana" [...] was viewed by AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine as [...] "misogynistic" [...] and its lyrics, describing a sexual predator, do not aim for the [...] "darkness" [...] of [...] "Billie Jean", instead sounding equally intrigued by and apprehensive of a sexual challenge, while having the opportunity to accept or resist it. [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] was described as being a [...] "paranoid anthem". [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] was seen as Jackson going [...] "a step further" [...] and offering [...] "a straightforward homily of personal commitment", which {{can be seen in the}} lyrics, [...] "I'm starting with the man in the mirror/I'm asking him to change his ways/And no message could have been any clearer/If you wanna make the world a better place/Take a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>yourself</b> and then make a change." [...] The lyrics to [...] "Speed Demon" [...] are about driving fast.|$|E
500|$|During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans {{from the}} low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone {{to that of a}} [...] "child whisperer" [...] due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it [...] "a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an {{identity}} crisis". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including [...] "When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>yourself</b> in the mirror / That's your way home". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing [...] "Shine!" [...] and Williams screaming [...] "Hey!". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, [...] "So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation" [...] and [...] "that bear with the red hat", as obvious references to Paddington. According to Sannwald, the lyrics include [...] "Pharrell's 'Happy"-ish 'Everybody is the same inside' bridge" [...] that allows the song to appeal to both children and their parents [...] "without sounding overly patronizing". [...] "Shine" [...] ends with Williams singing in the falsetto register.|$|E
500|$|After the 2009 {{extension}} of the tour was announced, some changes {{were made to the}} setlist. [...] "Candy Shop" [...] had a new video backdrop by artist Marilyn Minter, featuring imagery of a giant tongue licking and spitting out neon-colored icing. Madonna also wore new opening outfit designed by Riccardo Tisci. [...] "Heartbeat" [...] was replaced by [...] "Holiday" [...] and incorporated elements of her then latest single [...] "Celebration", and her first single [...] "Everybody". After Michael Jackson's death, it was modified to include a medley of three Michael Jackson songs, as an homage to the recently deceased singer. The performance featured Madonna's dancer Kento, who danced in similar clothing and dancing style as Jackson. Madonna's 1985 single [...] "Dress You Up" [...] replaced the rock version of [...] "Borderline". It featured elements of rock songs like [...] "My Sharona" [...] by The Knack and [...] "God Save The Queen" [...] by Sex Pistols. [...] "Hung Up" [...] was removed and replaced by an up-beat version of [...] "Frozen" [...] with interpolations from [...] "Open Your Heart", which was set between [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". The video backdrop for [...] "Frozen" [...] used video outtakes from the song's music video, directed by Chris Cunningham. [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was also slightly edited for selected performances with the lyrics from Michael Jackson's song [...] "Man in the Mirror, [...] "If you wanna {{make the world a better}} place... Take a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>yourself,</b> and then make a change" [...] appearing on the screens before the beginning of the song.|$|E

2500|$|When the Grand Duke {{arranged}} {{a change of}} class into the gentry for his mistress and the couple's illegitimate children, Alexandra Petrovna appealed to Alexander II to intervene, but she found her brother-in-law less than sympathetic. [...] "You see," [...] he bluntly told her, [...] "your husband is {{in the prime of}} his life, and he needs a woman with whom he can be in love. And <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>yourself!</b> See even how you dress! No man would be attracted". After this encounter, however, Alexander did advise his brother to be more discreet and exiled Catherine Chislova to Wenden, near Riga in 1875. Grand Duke Nicholas managed to have Chislova returned and had her installed with their illegitimate children in the Crimea.|$|E
2500|$|... "Everything to Me", the album's fourth {{track and}} {{official}} first single, reunited Monica with producer Missy Elliott {{and saw the}} pair basically reprising the formula of previous successes such as [...] "So Gone" [...] (2003) and [...] "A Dozen Roses (You Remind Me)" [...] (2006). A musical ode to all things good in life, written by singer Jazmine Sullivan, the retro ballad contains a prominent sample of the Deniece Williams' 1981 recording [...] "Silly." [...] Released to rave reviews among critics, who noted it the album's [...] "standout track — as solid as a brick house; great singing, great lyrics, great production, just a great all-around song," [...] "Everything to Me" [...] became the singer's most-successful release in years. Elliott also contributed [...] "If You Were My Man", {{one of the few}} up tempo songs on Still Standing, which Monica described as the song, who was most out of her character. Originally titled [...] "Betcha", the track samples Evelyn [...] "Champagne" [...] King's 1982 record [...] "Betcha She Don't Love You", featuring heavy elements of 1980's music, and garnered a mixed response by critics, whose reviews of the song alternated between [...] "blemish," [...] "brainless," [...] and [...] "funky". [...] "Mirror", the sixth track produced by Jim Jonsin, was recorded late into the production of the album. A song about self-acceptance, Monica noted the composition one of her personal standouts on the album: [...] "Its basically about being able to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>yourself</b> in the mirror and be completely happy with the person that you are," [...] she said. [...] "Having no shame or feeling pain again, and I am at that place in my life." ...|$|E

Undergraduates in a science class supposed that these behaviors were obvious until their explorations exposed questions with no quick answers. While exploring materials, students researched Galileo, his trial, and its aftermath. Galileo came to life both in their presentations about him, and in the context of lab investigations by the emerging class community. Questions and experiments evolved continually; differing perspectives on science and authority were exchanged respectfully.

Since November 2013, the EU FP 7 Project SEMEOTICONS is working to make this possible.

The device, called Wize Mirror, integrates unobtrusive imaging sensors used to capture videos, images and 3 D scans of the face. These are processed to assess the risk of a cardio-metabolic disease and thereby suggest possible strategies to prevent its onset...|$|R
50|$|The waking {{consciousness}} is {{the awareness of}} the world, our bodies, and ourselves. This includes humans experiencing the awareness of being aware of ourselves, an intrinsic ability to humans. It's the ability to look in a mirror and {{know that you are}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>yourself,</b> and not just another human being. Being awake allows the distinction between tasks and default brain states, and also distinguishes between background and foreground processing. Being awake allows the person to not only be aware of themselves and the world, but also to have conscious motor coordination and understand the difference between need and want that comes from secondary consciousness.|$|R

5000|$|Pyle {{enrolled}} {{as an art}} {{student at}} the University of Colorado Boulder, {{while working as a}} commercial illustrator for Gano-Downs department store in Denver, when he found an employment poster for animators at Walt Disney Studios. Pyle left from Colorado in 1937 and relocated to Los Angeles and was initially hired by Disney as an office boy in 1937. His first feature film was Pinocchio in 1940, in which he worked as an assistant animator under Milt Kahl, one of Disney's Nine Old Men. In a 2010 interview with the Coloradan Alumni Magazine, explained how he animated Pinocchio, [...] "The character had to act — raise its eyebrows, turn and jump and react to other characters. And the way you could do it was by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>yourself</b> in a mirror to see what that expression looked like."

60|$|Miss Roxy Toothacre, {{who sits}} {{trotting}} the baby, is a tall, thin, angular woman, with sharp black eyes, and hair once black, but now well streaked with gray. These ravages of time, however, were concealed by an ample mohair frisette of glossy blackness woven {{on each side}} into a heap of stiff little curls, which pushed up her cap border in rather a bristling and decisive way. In all her movements and personal habits, even to her tone of voice and manner of speaking, Miss Roxy was vigorous, spicy, and decided. Her mind on all subjects was made up, and she spoke generally as one having authority; and who should, if she should not? Was she not a sort of priestess and sibyl in all the most awful straits and mysteries of life? How many births, and weddings, and deaths {{had come and gone}} under her jurisdiction! And amid weeping or rejoicing, was not Miss Roxy still the master-spirit,--consulted, referred to by all?--was not her word law and precedent? Her younger sister, Miss Ruey, a pliant, cozy, easy-to-be-entreated personage, plump and cushiony, revolved around her as a humble satellite. Miss Roxy looked on Miss Ruey as quite a frisky young thing, though under her ample frisette of carroty hair her head might be seen white with the same snow that had powdered that of her sister. Aunt Ruey had a face much resembling the kind of one you may see, reader, by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>yourself</b> in the convex side of a silver milk-pitcher.
