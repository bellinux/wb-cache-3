5|$|The Tanzimat proved unpopular with <b>large</b> <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{population}} and a Bedouin revolt broke out, with Transjordanian tribes launching raids against Tiberias and its countryside {{in the summer}} of 1863. Aqil was unable to stop the raids, and may {{have played a role in}} the revolt. In response, the Ottomans dispatched a 2,000-strong, artillery-backed force from Damascus and Acre to Tiberias. The presence of artillery caused the Transjordanian tribes to retreat. Aqil viewed this deployment as an attack on his jurisdiction and issued his resignation in protest, all the while hoping Kapuli Pasha would back down and reject his resignation. To that end, he had Jewish notables from Tiberias and the French consul of Beirut lobby on his behalf, but without success, as Kapuli Pasha, content to see the elimination of a local power such as Aqil, accepted his resignation.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} break out of Normandy, the Allied armies {{developed}} a multi-stage operation. It started with a British and Canadian attack along the eastern battle line around Caen in Operation Goodwood on 18 July. The German Army responded by sending a large portion of its armoured reserves to defend. Then, on 25 July thousands of American bombers carpet bombed a 6000-metre hole on the western end of the German lines around Saint-Lô in Operation Cobra, allowing the Americans to push forces through this hole in the German lines. After some initial resistance, the German forces were overwhelmed and the Americans broke through. On 1 August, Lieutenant General George S. Patton was named the commanding officer of the newly recommissioned US Third Army—which included <b>large</b> <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers that had broken through the German lines—and with few German reserves behind the front line, the race was on. The Third Army quickly pushed south and then east, meeting very little German resistance. Concurrently, the British and Canadian troops pushed south (Operation Bluecoat) in an attempt to keep the German armour engaged. Under the weight of this British and Canadian attack, the Germans withdrew; the orderly withdrawal eventually collapsed due to lack of fuel.|$|E

25|$|After nearly {{achieving}} {{agricultural self-sufficiency}} in the 1960s, Iran {{reached the point}} in 1979 where 65 percent of its food had to be imported. Declining productivity was blamed {{on the use of}} modern fertilizers, which had inadvertently scorched the thin Iranian soil. Unresolved land reform issues, a lack of economic incentives to raise surplus crops, and low profit ratios combined to drive increasingly <b>large</b> <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farm population into urban areas.|$|E
25|$|The Bengal famine of 1943-44 (Bengali: Pañcāśēra manwantara) {{was a major}} {{famine in}} the Bengal {{province}} in British India during World War II. An estimated 2.1million {{people died in the}} famine, the deaths occurring first from starvation and then from diseases, which included cholera, malaria, smallpox, dysentery, and kala-azar. Other factors, such as malnutrition, population displacement, unsanitary conditions, and lack of health care, further increased disease fatalities. Millions were impoverished as the crisis overwhelmed <b>large</b> <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy and social fabric, accelerating a trend toward economic inequality.|$|E

25|$|Though <b>large</b> <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female {{population}} remained illiterate through {{the turn of}} the century, a growing number of middle-class women began to pursue higher education and work outside of the home. Many early female workers found employment in schools, government and commercial offices. The formation of the Union of Professional Women in the 1920s, which embraced university and professional women, played a large role in the suffrage movement. By 1936, over a million Brazilian women worked outside the home, which led to changing perceptions of women's family roles and a remodeling of the nation's commercial usages.|$|E
25|$|During {{the world}} {{wars of the}} twentieth century the United States fared better {{than the rest of the}} combatants because - aside from the attack at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 - neither world war was fought on American territory. Yet, even in the United States, the wars meant sacrifice. During the peak of Second World War activity, nearly 40 per cent of US GDP was devoted to war production. Decisions about large swaths of the economy were largely made for {{military}} purposes and nearly all relevant inputs were allocated to the war effort. Many goods were rationed, prices and wages controlled and many durable consumer goods were no longer produced. <b>Large</b> <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workforce were inducted into the military, paid half wages, and roughly half of those were sent into harm's way.|$|E
25|$|The Vietnam War hastened the {{modernisation}} and Westernisation of Thai society. The American {{presence and}} {{the exposure to}} Western culture that came with it {{had an effect on}} almost every aspect of Thai life. Before the late 1960s, full access to Western culture was limited to a highly educated elite in society, but the Vietnam War brought the outside world face to face with <b>large</b> <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thai society as never before. With US dollars pumping up the economy, the service, transportation, and construction industries grew phenomenally as did drug abuse and prostitution. The traditional rural family unit was broken down as more and more rural Thais moved to the city to find new jobs. This led to a clash of cultures as Thais were exposed to Western ideas about fashion, music, values, and moral standards.|$|E

25|$|Their {{presence}} is controversial, and resisted by <b>large</b> <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian population, {{who argue that}} the primarily Sunni Muslim Palestinians dilute Christian numbers. Many Shia Muslims also look unfavorably upon the Palestinian presence since the refugee camps {{have tended to be}} concentrated in their home areas. The Lebanese Sunnis, however, would be happy to see these Palestinians given the Lebanese nationality, thus increasing the Lebanese Sunni population by well over 10% and tipping the fragile electoral balance much in favor of the Sunnis. Late prime minister Rafiq Hariri —himself a Sunni— had hinted {{on more than one occasion}} on the inevitability of granting these refugees Lebanese citizenship. Thus far the refugees are Lebanese citizenship as well as many rights enjoyed by the rest of the population, and are confined to severely overcrowded refugee camps, in which construction rights are severely constricted.|$|E
25|$|Student unrest {{became a}} regular feature of Ethiopian {{life in the}} 1960s and 1970s. Marxism took root in <b>large</b> <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ethiopian intelligentsia, {{particularly}} among those who had studied abroad and had thus been exposed to radical and left-wing sentiments that were becoming popular {{in other parts of}} the globe. Resistance by conservative elements at the Imperial Court and Parliament, and by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, made Haile Selassie's land reform proposals difficult to implement, and also damaged the standing of the government, costing Haile Selassie much of the goodwill he had once enjoyed. This bred resentment among the peasant population. Efforts to weaken unions also hurt his image. As these issues began to pile up, Haile Selassie left much of domestic governance to his Prime Minister, Aklilu Habte Wold, and concentrated more on foreign affairs.|$|E
25|$|Tsarist Russia {{was being}} torn apart in 1914 {{and was not}} {{prepared}} to fight a modern war. The industrial sector was small, finances were poor, the rural areas could barely feed themselves. Repeated military failures and bureaucratic ineptitude soon turned <b>large</b> <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population against the government. Control of the Baltic Sea by the German fleet, and of the Black Sea by combined German and Ottoman forces prevented Russia from importing supplies or exporting goods. By the middle of 1915 the impact of the war was demoralizing. Food and fuel supplies grew scarce, war casualties kept climbing and inflation was mounting. Strikes increased among low-paid factory workers, and the peasants, who wanted land reforms, were restless. Meanwhile, elite distrust of the incompetent decision making at the highest levels was deepened when a semiliterate mystic, Grigory Rasputin, gained enormous influence over the Tsar and his wife until he was assassinated. Major strikes broke out early in 1917 and the army sided with the strikers in the February Revolution. The tsar abdicated. The liberal reformer Alexander Kerensky came to power in July, but in the October Revolution Lenin and the Bolsheviks took control. In early 1918 they signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that made Germany dominant in Eastern Europe, while Russia plunged into years of civil war.|$|E

500|$|In {{the height}} of civic unrest, Governor-General of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah arrived in Dhaka on 19 March 1948. On 21 March, at a civic {{reception}} at Racecourse Ground, he claimed that the language issue was designed by a [...] "fifth column" [...] to divide Pakistani Muslims. Jinnah further declared that [...] "Urdu, and only Urdu" [...] embodied the spirit of Muslim nations and would remain as the state language, labelling those who disagreed with his views as [...] "Enemies of Pakistan". Jinnah delivered a similar speech at Curzon Hall of the University of Dhaka on 24 March. At both meetings, Jinnah was interrupted by <b>large</b> <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> audience. He later called a meeting of a state language committee of action, and overruled the contract that was signed by Khawaja Nazimuddin with the student leaders.

500|$|Nevertheless, <b>large</b> <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{population}} {{continued to}} support seeking {{a settlement with}} the Ottomans; the writings of Metropolitan Symeon record {{that a number of}} inhabitants fled at this time to the Ottomans. This sentiment included even some members of the nobility: the contemporary Byzantine historian Doukas records that soon after taking over the city, the Venetians imprisoned four leading aristocrats, led by a certain Platyskalites, for their association with the Ottomans. The four men were exiled, first to Crete, and then to Venice itself and Padua. Only after the fall of Thessalonica in 1430 were the two surviving ones released. The contemporary Venetian Morosini Codex also records a story of a conspiracy—dismissed as [...] "slanderous" [...] by Donald Nicol—led by the Despot Andronikos to hand over the city to the Turks. The plot was reportedly discovered in November 1423, and Andronikos and his supporters were exiled, with the Despot sent to Nauplia in the Morea.|$|E

500|$|With Ruth in the lineup, the Yankees' {{fortunes}} were transformed. Playing on four World Series champion teams, Ruth hit 659 {{home runs}} and scored 1,959 runs; both marks are team records as of 2017. He is second in club history with 1,978 runs batted in and accumulated 2,518 hits as a Yankee, third on the team's all-time list. As well as prowess on the field, Ruth had a larger-than-life personality, bringing him and his team {{a huge amount of}} press and public attention. The addition of Ruth helped the Yankees increase their attendance to 1,289,422 for the 1920 season; {{it was the first time}} that any MLB team drew more than one million fans in a year. His skills and charm appealed to <b>large</b> <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New York City population; Stout wrote that [...] "He belonged to everyone." [...] New York was the AL attendance leader for 13 of Ruth's 15 seasons with the team; the Yankees became solidly profitable as well, making over $370,000 in 1920 and remaining in the black for the rest of the decade.|$|E
