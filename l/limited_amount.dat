5|$|Charcoal {{can be made}} by slow {{pyrolysis}} of wood by heating it in {{the absence}} of air in a kiln. The carefully stacked branches, often oak, are burned with a very <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of air. The process of converting them into charcoal takes about fifteen hours. Charcoal is used as a fuel in barbecues and by blacksmiths and has many industrial and other uses.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{and other}} facultative anaerobes {{constitute}} about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission {{is the major}} route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease. Cells are able to survive outside the body for a <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of time, which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination. A growing body of research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for extended periods outside a host.|$|E
5|$|Evolve is {{an action}} video {{game with a}} focus on both co-operative, and competitive, {{multiplayer}} gameplay. The game adapts a '4v1' asymmetrical structure where four players take control of the Hunters, while the fifth player controls the Monster. The Hunters' main objective is to track and hunt the Monster in a <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of time, while the Monster's goal is to evolve and make themselves more powerful.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the human}} history of South Dakota was shaped by its geology. Gold seekers founded most of the larger cities around the Black Hills, and {{quarrying}} was an important economic activity in several areas in eastern South Dakota. Mines and quarries in present-day South Dakota produce gold, Sioux quartzite, Milbank granite, sand, gravel, limestone, mica, and uranium. The state also produces a very <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of oil and natural gas.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is a {{reactive}} metal. In {{moist air}} or moist argon, the metal oxidizes rapidly, producing {{a mixture of}} oxides and hydrides. If the metal is exposed long enough to a <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of water vapor, a powdery surface coating of PuO2 is formed. Also formed is plutonium hydride but an excess of water vapor forms only PuO2.|$|E
5|$|Showdown: (Stylized as Sh0wdown) A mode {{added in}} a later update. In this mode, 2 teams of 2 players battle each other in short missions. Missions vary from {{the first team to}} steal 3 hard drives to the {{offensive}} team having to hack the servers the defensive team is protecting in a <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of time.|$|E

5|$|The lane is a {{restricted}} {{area in which}} players can stay for only a <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of time. On all levels, a team on the offensive (in possession of the ball) is prohibited to stay inside the lane {{for more than three}} seconds; after three seconds the player will be called with a three-second violation which will result in a turnover.|$|E
5|$|The {{permanganate}} {{exhibits a}} higher toxicity than the manganese(II) compounds. The fatal dose is about 10g, and several fatal intoxications have occurred. The strong oxidative effect leads to necrosis of the mucous membrane. For example, the esophagus is affected if the permanganate is swallowed. Only a <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> is {{absorbed by the}} intestines, but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver.|$|E
5|$|A reoccurring {{theme in}} legend and folktale {{consists}} of a man or, more often, {{a woman who is}} challenged to gain as much land as can be traveled within a <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of time. This motif is attested by Livy around 1 CE, 5th century BCE Greek historian Herodotus, and in folktales from Northern Europe. In six tales from Jutland, Denmark and one from Germany a plough is used similarly as in Livy's account, though the conditions are often met by walking or riding.|$|E

40|$|CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITATIONS. STATE OFFICES. INITIATIVE STATUTE. With {{respect to}} {{candidates}} for legislative and statewide elective offices, adds statutes which: <b>Limit</b> <b>amounts</b> {{that can be}} contributed to or received by a candidate from individuals, corporations, committees, or political parties. <b>Limit</b> aggregate <b>amounts</b> of contributions by an individual or corporation to all candidates. <b>Limit</b> <b>amounts</b> candidates can contribute from personal funds without complying with disclosure and other requirements. Limit total contributions to legislative candidates in non election years. <b>Limit</b> <b>amounts</b> of prior contributions candidates can retain past specified dates. Require certain mass mailing disclosures. Contain other limitations and enforcement provisions. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: The initiative would increase state administrative costs by $ 225, 000 in 1984 - 85, $ 450, 000 in 1985 - 86 and a comparable amount annually thereafter...|$|R
5|$|Although {{the player}} can use {{firearms}} to kill monsters, Resident Evil emphasizes evasion over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} player with limited ammunition. The player has a <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of health which decreases when attacked by monsters. Nevertheless, players can regain their health by collecting and using herbs, which can be mixed with other herbs to increase their healing effect. Some monsters can also infect the player with a poisoning effect, which gradually depletes the player's health over time until the poison is cured with serum or special herbs. Zombies that are defeated but not decapitated or burned eventually revive and mutate into much deadlier opponents.|$|E
5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only a <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone John {{extensively}} {{affected areas}} of Western Australia, but damage {{was not as}} bad as expected. Widespread power outages across the Pilbara region were caused by John. Strong winds caused minor damage to infrastructure across the coast, as well as tree damage. 140windmills were destroyed by the cyclone on the coast. Further inland, rainfall associated with the cyclone and its remnants brought flooding, which flooded 25houses and caused rivers to overflow. The system was responsible for no deaths and a <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of damage. After the season, the name John was retired from the Australian tropical cyclone naming list.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{technological}} {{limitations of the}} Game Boy Advance cartridge size, voice acting was kept to a minimum. Though many characters from Kingdom Hearts were voiced by the cast from before, the Japanese version used the following voice actors: Keiji Fujiwara as Axel; Tatsuya Kando as Vexen, Marluxia, and Lexaeus; and Rieko Katayama as Larxene. A <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of voice acting was added only for the battle sequences. Voice clips from the first Kingdom Hearts were inserted into Chain of Memories. The English version is absent of dialogue; voices during Organization battles are replaced with simple grunts, laughter, and other battle cries.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} brings one materia {{into the}} party when they join, carrying one spell {{that can be used}} in combat. Materia have a limited number of uses before they must be recharged at one of the game's magic shops. Like party members, materia gain experience when used, and can be leveled up to a maximum level of nine. Characters can swap materia among themselves, with unequipped materia being used mid-battle for such things as healing party members, compensating for the <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of healing items.|$|E
5|$|In {{neighboring}} {{areas of}} Russia {{there are significant}} numbers of Norway spruce, but they only exist sporadically within Øvre Pasvik, {{with no more than}} 40 trees in one place. The lack of spruce is caused by a combination of frost occurring as late as June, and wildfire. There is also a <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of birch, specifically dwarf birch and silver birch. Aspen is uncommon largely because its bark and roots are popular food for animals. Along some creeks there are bird cherry and grey alder. The area is too dry to allow the latter to grow away from creeks and lake sides. There are eight to ten species of willow within the national park.|$|E

5|$|Kyle Vogt, {{who played}} Peter, told the {{production}} {{team at the}} outset of filming that he only had a <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of time to dedicate to the project. Not all of his scenes were filmed by the time his schedule ran out, and he left the production despite the fact that Peter was to play a pivotal role in the then-unrecorded climax. His lines in {{the last half of the}} film were given to Ellery, whose character is never introduced, explained, or addressed by name.|$|E
5|$|RNA splicing, {{carried out}} by a complex called the spliceosome, is {{the process by which}} introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the {{remaining}} exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is known as alternative splicing, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of DNA.|$|E
5|$|Reach {{features}} updated {{versions of}} old weapons, plus new weapons fulfilling various combat roles. In Halo 3, players can carry single-use equipment power-ups that offer temporary offensive or defensive advantages. This system of single-use equipment is replaced in Reach by reusable and persistent armor abilities that remain with a character {{until they are}} replaced. The abilities are a jetpack; active camouflage; sprint; hologram, which creates a facsimile of the player running towards a target point; drop shield, which creates a bubble that heals those inside and protects them from a <b>limited</b> <b>amount</b> of damage; and armor lock, which immobilizes the player but grants invincibility {{for a brief period}} of time. When playing as Covenant Elites, players also have access to an evade armor ability.|$|E
