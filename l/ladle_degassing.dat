40|$|Represented are {{the results}} of {{operating}} the <b>ladle</b> <b>degassing</b> vacuum plant (productivity: 120 tons of liquid steel) with various dust collectors. The process gases’ cooling and dedusting, obtained in the closed loop buran study, provides opportunity to install a bag filter after that closed loop and its efficient use. Proven is {{the effectiveness of the}} cylindrical cyclone replacement with a multichannel (buran) dust collector, based on a system of closed-loop (return coupling) serially connected curved ducts, where the dusty gas flow rotation axis is vertically positioned. The system of closed-loop serially connected curvilinear channels creates preconditions for the emergence of a negative feedback at the curvilinear gas flow containing transit and circulating flows. These conditions are embodied with circulating flows connecting the in- and outputs of the whole system each channel. The transit flow multiple continuous filtration through the circulating dust layers leads to the formation and accumulation of particles aggregates in the collection chamber. The validity of such a dusty flow control mechanism is confirmed by experimental data obtained in a vacuum chamber. Therefore, replacing one of the two buran’s forevacuum pumps assemblies with the necessary number of curved channels (closed loop) is estimated in a promising method...|$|E

40|$|High {{strength}} {{low alloy}} steel was produced by electric arc furnace, vacuum <b>degassing,</b> <b>ladle</b> treatment and continuous casting route. The steel was hot rolled by applying a schedule to simulate industrial control of hot rolling procedure {{for the production of}} plates as closely as possible in laboratory level, in order to investigate the effect of applying different strain rates onto hot rolling procedure in the range of temperatures between 1250 to 900 ºC. After the hot rolling procedure, the plate was spray cooled at a cooling rate of 5 ºC/s to a temperature of 650 ºC and then cooled to room temperature. The results showed a grain refinement {{as a function of the}} strain rate increases from 1 to 8 s-¹ and as a consequence an increase in mechanical properties of: yield strength and ultimate tensile strength; and keeping almost constant the ductility...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{gives the}} results of work on melting, pouring, forging and heat {{treatment}} of 415 -ton 45 H 3 M 1 F steel ingots as semiproducts for manufacturing large backup rolls at the request of  «Severstal» Company. For the production of rollers, a new grade of steel based on 0. 45 %С and 3 %Cr, additionally alloyed by Mo and V, was developed in PJSC «Energomashspetsstal» and applied in industry. Steel of bainite class provides the best combination of strength and plasticity properties. Metal was prepared by melting 7 heats in arc steel-melting furnaces with the capacity of 100 and 50 tons with subsequent out-of-furnace treatment on ladle – furnace and <b>ladle</b> – <b>degassing</b> units. The pouring of steel was carried out from four steel-pouring ladles into a vertical mould under vacuum through a tundish ladle with the protection of stream by argon. The forging of ingots {{was conducted on the}} automated 150 MN forging system. The obtained billets were exposed to primary heat treatment which consisted of heating for recrystallization, isothermal soaking, in order to provide the removal of residual stresses, additional dehydrogenization to give the material lower hardness and controlled cooling for the prevention of snowflake formation. Heating of ingots for forging and preliminary heat treatment was carried out in heat treatment furnaces with the carrying capacity of up to 500 tons. For the heat treatment of the backup roll, a horizontal sprayer unit was applied. The tooling of the backup roll was executed on a lathe with one pace-plate and the final mechanical treatment was conducted on the machine-tool of Hercules NWD 1500 × 18000 CNC. Finished products with 225 -ton mass of the following dimensions: a barrel with a diameter and a length of 2, 360 mm and 4, 800 mm, respectively, at a general length of 10, 650 mm were obtained.    </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{performed}} at Uddeholms AB {{with the purpose}} to investigate theparameters affecting the formation of inclusions during the manufacturing of a low carbonmanganese-steel. A follow-up, steel and slag sampling and evaluations in microscope have been done for a totalof five heats. The results for each heat have been evaluated {{in relation to the}} theory from the literaturesurvey and suggestions for changes in the process {{to reduce the amount of}} inclusions whichhave a negative effect on the steel quality have been given. The project extends over a large process where many parameters affect the formation ofinclusions. However, a tendency that a higher addition of alloys seems to increase the totalamount of inclusions before and after the vacuum degassing is seen. The majority of the studied inclusions seem to approach the composition of the top slag aftervacuum <b>degassing.</b> <b>Ladle</b> glaze may cause the inclusions which had a different compositioncompared to that of the slag. A high or low ladleage together with a high argon flow during vacuum degassing seems todissolve particles from the refractory which later on get trapped inside the inclusions. The floatation for two heats has been studied where a short floatation seems to give a higheramount of inclusions in casted material. In machined material so called stringers were found. The main composition of those stringerswas pure alumina. Inclusions with a composition of pure alumina were not found in the liquidsteel, thus the pure alumina inclusions must be formed during the casting. The reason whythose pure alumina inclusions are formed remains for further investigations...|$|R
