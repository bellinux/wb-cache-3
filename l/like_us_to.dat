In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would <b>like</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} pitched to the Nine Network through Harris and Graeme-Evans' joint {{independent}} production company, Kids Like Us. A pilot was filmed in mid-1998, which {{was shown to}} a test audience. No changes to the format were made after this test. After being commissioned, the first full series began production in October. The Nine Network initially signed a co-venture with Kids <b>Like</b> <b>Us</b> <b>to</b> produce two 45-episode series of the show and the first went to air on Nine in April 1999. Hi-5 was granted a P classification, deeming it specifically {{designed to meet the}} needs and interests of pre-schoolers, allowing it to be broadcast on the Nine Network with a 30-minute runtime commercial-free. The first series was produced for US$20,000 to US$30,000 for each episode.|$|E

In Kahn's view, [...] "To me, a 'congregation' represents people and community while the word [...] "temple" [...] represents a place or building.

"Hurry up, boys, it's three o'clock, and Uncle Fritz <b>likes</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be punctual, you know," [...] said Franz one Wednesday {{afternoon}} as a bell rang, and {{a stream of}} literary-looking young gentlemen with books and paper in their hands were seen going toward the museum.|$|R

500|$|In {{the early}} {{phases of the}} show, Weinberg was {{involved}} in occasional comedy bits, but mostly focused on his musical responsibilities, including the selection of walk-on music for guests. The band got a 30-second featured spot each night after O'Brien's opening monologue. O'Brien often received poor notices {{during the early years}} of Late Night, and Jon Pareles of The New York Times pronounced the Max Weinberg 7 as the [...] "saving grace" [...] of the show. Weinberg established an image by dressing in high-quality suits and a tie; he said, [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> look sharp and play sharp," [...] and [...] "I don't want to look like the audience, I want to look different." [...] Weinberg became a television celebrity, and his visibility and stature grew from Late Night and established an image for him beyond Springsteen. Indeed, much of the show's young fan base, and some of the staff on the show itself, were unaware of Weinberg's past role in the E Street Band.|$|E
500|$|Finally, from {{a purely}} {{linguistic}} point of view, {{there is the}} dichotomy that the IAU created between 'planet' and 'dwarf planet'. The term 'dwarf planet' arguably contains two words, a noun (planet) and an adjective (dwarf). Thus, the term could suggest that a dwarf planet {{is a type of}} planet, even though the IAU explicitly defines a dwarf planet as not so being. By this formulation therefore, 'dwarf planet' and 'minor planet' are best considered compound nouns. Benjamin Zimmer of Language Log summarised the confusion: [...] "The fact that the IAU would <b>like</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> think of dwarf planets as distinct from 'real' planets lumps the lexical item 'dwarf planet' in with such oddities as 'Welsh rabbit' (not really a rabbit) and 'Rocky Mountain oysters' (not really oysters)." [...] As Dava Sobel, the historian and popular science writer who participated in the IAU's initial decision in October 2006, noted in an interview with National Public Radio, [...] "A dwarf planet is not a planet, and in astronomy, there are dwarf stars, which are stars, and dwarf galaxies, which are galaxies, so it's a term no one can love, dwarf planet." [...] Mike Brown noted {{in an interview with the}} Smithsonian that, [...] "Most of the people in the dynamical camp really did not want the word [...] "dwarf planet," [...] but that was forced through by the pro-Pluto camp. So you're left with this ridiculous baggage of dwarf planets not being planets." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band's co-lead vocalist and rapper Mike Shinoda and Rick Rubin {{served as}} {{producers}} for the album. [...] "Typically we'll have a once-a-week meeting to go {{listen to the}} songs that they're coming up with and talk about them. For {{so early in the}} project, they are much further along than they have been on the last two albums we did. On A Thousand Suns there were still a lot of irons in the fire. We knew, 'OK, we can't do this forever. Let's leave this batch and we'll come back and address it when we start up again, Rubin said. Bennington explained that Rubin [...] "gives us spaces to just be ourselves and to work on our own...He gives us a clear and concise description of what he likes...He would <b>like</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> push ourselves into a more fresh take on that particular sound." [...] He also stated that Shinoda guides the band through the process of each song, and called the team-up of Shinoda and Rubin [...] "our golden ticket." ...|$|E

"Death's head himself shan't wring it from me, mistress, if I've {{a mind to}} keep anything; and I'll {{always be}} your friend," [...] replied Liddy, emphatically, {{at the same time}} {{bringing}} a few more tears into her own eyes, not from any particular necessity, but from an artistic sense of making herself in keeping with the remainder of the picture, which seems to influence women at such times. [...] "I think God <b>likes</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be good friends, don't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, sir, but it ain't `as oosual,'" [...] {{suggested}} Bill Jones, {{turning the}} quid in his cheek; [...] "it's quite on-oosual for the <b>likes</b> o' <b>us</b> <b>to</b> sup with a lady." ...|$|R
2500|$|Amina Ali {{argues that}} Somali women {{have brought a}} [...] "strong sense of {{political}} participation and activism" [...] with them to Britain, rooted in a tradition of female engagement in politics in Somalia. In the UK, however, she argues that they find themselves excluded from the political process. Early Somali community groups, Ali states, were often headed by women and it was these groups that often introduced Somali women to British politics and [...] "pointed them {{in the direction of}} the Labour party as the party for 'people <b>like</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> vote for'". She argues that despite this party loyalty, Labour has taken the Somali vote for granted and not engaged with or sought to understand the needs of the Somali community. She complains that Labour MPs in constituencies with large Somali populations have wrongly assumed that since the community is Muslim, they should engage with male community members only, and that even Somali men complain about a lack of engagement. In the run-up to the 2015 general election, Ali argued that Labour MPs in marginal constituencies [...] "are slowly coming to the realisation that the Somali vote matters".|$|E

Records, who wanted the band to follow up with a commercial record. [...] "For me, being sort of the culprit behind that particular album, it was done in a way to undermine just sort of following the formula of doing Rumours 2 and Rumours 3, which is kind of the business model Warner Bros. would have <b>liked</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> follow." ...|$|R

On 12 February 2009, with Portsmouth battling relegation, Kranjčar publicly declared his desire to quit Portsmouth and move to a bigger club.
