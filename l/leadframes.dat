40|$|Wire bonding failures, {{including}} non-stick on die pad (bond-off) and smash ball of {{the first}} bond, are often encountered in manufacturing of miniaturized packages with increased feature density and higher UPH requirement. Many researches have been conducted with an attempt to solve these issues. However, these studies mainly focused on the correlations between bonding pad qualities and robust ball bonding solutions. Few of them investigated these failures from a mechanical point of view, such as deflection of <b>leadframe</b> under vertical bonding force. For today's small outline transistor (SOT) packages, the <b>leadframe</b> has low profiles and complex structures, which makes the wire bonding response very complex and difficult to be predicted. This paper demonstrated that the deflection of <b>leadframe</b> at the first bond position {{played an important role}} on the bond-off failure for SOT packages. When the deflection was larger than 5 μm at critical bonding locations, severe bond-off failure occurred. By applying finite element analysis, some ways to reduce this deflection thus eliminating the risk of bond-off failure were discussed and verified by experiments, which include <b>leadframe</b> structure modification at some local areas, change of supporting tape types, and lowering of bonding temperature.

Reducing the copper thickness is understood to present various thermal and reliability failure mode and mechanisms, such as die cracking and delamination. However, no in-depth study has been pursued to determine the capability of achieving the product requirements in terms of thermal and reliability in a 3 D stacked-die package. The drive towards a Die-Free Package Cost (DFPC) reduction has led the authors to study the used of a thin <b>leadframe</b> in a QFN 3 D stacked-die. Hence, the work presents basis for the qualification of a thin <b>leadframe</b> design, and also to demonstrate the thermal and reliability performance. Finally, an extensive virtual thermal–mechanical prototyping has to be achieved {{in order to understand}} the physics of materials during the assembly and reliability testing of a 3 D stacked-die package with a thin <b>leadframe.</b> This design rule was found to be developed in order to prevent a die crack occurrence between die and <b>leadframe</b> in the semiconductor package...|$|R

40|$|Small outline {{transistor}} (SOT) packages, {{because of}} their low cost and low profile, are widely used in consumer electronics. Ni/Fe alloy (A 42) is {{the most widely used}} <b>leadframe</b> material of SOT packages because of its good formability and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) match with silicon die. The very small size of SOT packages allow a higher package density on a board, but the small size and close proximity of SOT packages make thermal management difficult. The low thermal conductivity of A 42, which is less than one tenth of that of copper, makes the thermal conduction even more difficult. Thus, the method of copper plating on A 42 <b>leadframe</b> is used to enhance the thermal conductivity of SOT packages while keeping their low cost and good CTE match between <b>leadframe</b> and silicon die. In this paper, the junction temperature T-j, the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance theta(j-a) and the junction-to-solder joint thermal resistance theta(j-sp) are used to evaluate the heat dissipating ability of the package. The finite element method is applied to study the influence of copper plating thickness on the thermal performance of a SOT package. A thermal resistance circuit model and the corresponding thermal resistance expression on function of the copper plating thickness are then proposed to quantify the influence of copper plating thickness. The proposed expression, which follows a hyperbolic form, can well predict thermal resistance of the model. Finally, die cracking issue of the SOT packages with copper <b>leadframe</b> is examined and the residual stress on silicon die after die bonding process is studied. By comparing the cracking pattern and the stress state, shear fracture is proposed to be the crack initiation mechanism. Results also show that copper plating on A 42 <b>leadframe</b> has little influence on the distribution of the thermal residual stress in the die. The stress level for the SOT package with copper plated A 42 <b>leadframe</b> is much lower than that with copper <b>leadframe,</b> which makes the die cracking risk much lower...|$|R

Copper (Cu) {{wire bonding}} on the {{pre-plated}} <b>leadframes</b> with Ni/Pd/AuAg plating {{has been applied}} extensively in the semiconductor industry for the interconnection of integrated-circuit (IC) packaging due to the lower material cost of Cu and its excellent electrical properties. Furthermore, the Cu wire bonding on the preplated leadframe has advantages, such as the tin whisker prevention and the robust package for automotive application. Nevertheless, a stitch bondability of Cu wire-preplated leadframe is facing several challenges, such as the Cu oxidation, the high hardness of Cu wire and the very thin AuAg plating on the <b>leadframes.</b> This paper discusses the effect of AuAg plating thickness in roughened pre-plated leadframe on the stitch bonding of Cu wires with the leadframe. The stitch bonding integrity was assessed using Dage 4000 shear/pull tool at a key wire bond responses of stitch pull at time zero (T 0). Results show that the stitch pull strength of the Cu-leadframe stitch bonding increases with the increase thickness of AuAg layer. FESEM images of the stitch bonding between the Cu wires and the pre-plated <b>leadframes</b> of different AuAg plating thickness did not show any defect in microstructures, thus it suggests that the bonding property is determined by diffusion mechanism at the Cu wire/AuAg stitch bonding interface.
