5|$|Although the {{official}} form of Malay, Bahasa Malaysia, is spoken {{by the government}} administration, it is used infrequently in colloquial conversation. The local dialect of Bahasa Sarawak (Sarawak Malay) dominates the vernacular. Bahasa Sarawak {{is the most common}} language of Sarawak Malays and other indigenous tribes. The Iban language, which has minor regional variations, is the most widely spoken native <b>language,</b> <b>with</b> 34 percent of the Sarawak population speaking it as a first language. The Bidayuh <b>language,</b> <b>with</b> six major dialects, is spoken by 10 percent of the population. The Orang Ulu have about 30 different language dialects. While the ethnic Chinese originate from a variety of backgrounds and speak many different dialects such as Hokkien, Hakka, Fuzhou, and Teochew, they also converse in Malaysian Mandarin.|$|E

5|$|A {{preoccupation with}} his own {{mortality}} permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based {{on a number of}} poems on the theme of death).

Shostakovich dedicated this score to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony.|$|E
40|$|Finite chase, or {{alternatively}} chase termination, {{is an important}} condition to ensure the decidability of existential rule languages. In the past few years, a number of rule <b>languages</b> <b>with</b> finite chase have been studied. In this work, we propose a novel approach for classifying the rule <b>languages</b> <b>with</b> finite chase. Using this approach, a family of decidable rule languages, which extend the existing <b>languages</b> <b>with</b> the finite chase property, are naturally defined. We then study the complexity of these languages. Although {{all of them are}} tractable for data complexity, we show that their combined complexity can be arbitrarily high. Furthermore, we prove that all the rule <b>languages</b> <b>with</b> finite chase that extend the weakly acyclic language are of the same expressiveness as the weakly acyclic one, while rule <b>languages</b> <b>with</b> higher combined complexity are in general more succinct than those with lower combined complexity.
