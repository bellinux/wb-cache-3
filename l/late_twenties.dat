In 260 the Roman emperor Valerian marched against the Sassanid Persian monarch Shapur I, who had invaded the empire's eastern regions; Valerian was defeated and captured near Edessa. Odaenathus, formally loyal to Rome and its emperor Gallienus (Valerian's son), was declared king of Palmyra. Launching successful campaigns against Persia, he was crowned King of Kings of the East in 263. Odaenathus crowned his eldest son, Herodianus, as co-ruler. In addition to the royal titles, Odaenathus received many Roman titles, most importantly corrector totius orientis (governor of the entire East), and ruled the Roman territories from the Black Sea to Palestine. In 267, when Zenobia was in her <b>late</b> <b>twenties</b> or early thirties, Odaenathus and his eldest son were assassinated while returning from a campaign.|$|E
5|$|Heian {{women were}} {{traditionally}} excluded from learning Chinese, the written language of government, but Murasaki, raised in her erudite father's household, showed a precocious aptitude for the Chinese classics {{and managed to}} acquire fluency. She married in her mid-to <b>late</b> <b>twenties</b> and {{gave birth to a}} daughter before her husband died, two years after they were married. It is uncertain when she began to write The Tale of Genji, but it was probably while she was married or shortly after she was widowed. In about 1005, Murasaki was invited to serve as a lady-in-waiting to Empress Shōshi at the Imperial court, probably because of her reputation as a writer. She continued to write during her service, adding scenes from court life to her work. After five or six years, she left court and retired with Shōshi to the Lake Biwa region. Scholars differ on the year of her death; although most agree on 1014, others have suggested she was alive in 1031.|$|E

We study the representation theory for B(p,q). We classify quasifinite irreducible highest weight B(p,q) -module.

Still, at a closer look there can be found interesting arguments to sustain the idea of a political background for this surprising economic acceleration.

This paper analyses the market as a frame of a political construction, and euro as a decisive tool for the purpose of the United Europe.
