40|$|This paper reviews New Zealand’s {{experience}} of <b>lockouts</b> {{over the last}} nearly two decades. It employs published and unpublished official (Statistics New Zealand) data plus unofficial data on the following, hitherto ignored, dimensions of lockouts: (i) employees involved in <b>lockouts,</b> (ii) person-days lost due to <b>lockouts</b> and (iii) the average duration of <b>lockouts.</b> The patterns of <b>lockouts</b> are compared for different New Zealand politico-legislative eras from 1986 to 2004. It is found that there has been, over time, a declining trend {{in the incidence of}} person-days lost due both to strikes and to <b>lockouts</b> in New Zealand. But the relative incidence of person-days lost due to <b>lockouts</b> vis a vis strikes rose quite sharply during the middle years of the operation of the union-hostile Employment Contracts Act, 1991. Comparisons are made with Australian experience. There are some notable similarities in the pattern of <b>lockouts</b> in both countries, including the tendency for the average duration of <b>lockouts</b> to be considerably longer than the average the duration of strikes...|$|R

50|$|The {{government}} recorded 1,825 {{strikes and}} <b>lockouts</b> in 1990. As a result, 24.1 million workdays were lost, 10.6 million to strikes and 13.5 million to <b>lockouts.</b> More than 1.3 million workers {{were involved in}} these labour disputes. The number and seriousness of strikes and <b>lockouts</b> have varied from year to year. However, the figures for 1990 and preliminary data from 1991 indicate declines from levels reached in the 1980s, when between 33 and 75 million workdays per year were lost because of labour disputes. In 1999, the government of India recorded about 927 strikes and <b>lockouts,</b> or {{about half of those}} for 1990. The number of lost man-days were about the same for 1999 and 1991, even though Indian economic output and number of workers had grown significantly over the 1990s.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{comments}} on <b>lockouts</b> in Australia and Briggs’ (2004 a) study of <b>lockouts</b> {{published in the}} Australian Bulletin of Labour June 2004. It seeks to look at Briggs findings in a broader historical context, by noting that recent past levels of disputes are {{a small fraction of}} the level of disputation during (say) the 1970 s, and that <b>lockouts,</b> though more prevalent during the half-decade ended 2003, are an even smaller fraction of the disputation levels that prevailed on average during the 1970 s. Briggs study focuses on the manufacturing sector, as this sector has, according to his research findings, been the most lockout-prone. As an addendum to Briggs focus on manufacturing, this paper draws attention to the non-manufacturing sector, which accounts for more than 85 per cent of Australian employees. It is noted that working days lost due to <b>lockouts</b> in this sector have decreased during the half-decade ended 2003 when compared to the preceding half-decade. Indeed, the decline in <b>lockouts</b> in the non-manufacturing sector during the half-decade ended 2003 exceeds the decline in strikes...|$|R

5|$|In May 2008, {{the owners}} decided {{to opt out}} of the 1993 arrangement, per the {{agreement}} with the players, with the termination to follow a year with no salary cap in 2010. By the CBA's expiration in March 2011, the NFLPA and the NFL had not yet come to terms on a new agreement. The owners were expected to lock out the players upon termination of the agreement. However, the NFLPA filed papers to decertify as a union on March 11, 2011, and filed an antitrust suit to enjoin the <b>lockout</b> with lead plaintiffs quarterbacks Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and Drew Brees. U.S. District Court judge Susan Richard Nelson granted the players' request to end the owners' <b>lockout</b> on April 25. The league asked Nelson to stay the order while they appealed to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals; Nelson refused. On April 29, the Eighth Circuit granted the league a temporary stay of Nelson's ruling; the league reinstated the <b>lockout</b> the same day. The Eighth Circuit vacated Nelson's ruling on July 8, affirming the legitimacy of the <b>lockout.</b> During the <b>lockout,</b> players were barred from using team facilities and contacting team coaches; many organized their own workout regimens.|$|E
50|$|Divisions V.1 and VI set out {{conditions}} for strikes and <b>lockouts.</b> Before such work stoppages occur a secret ballot vote must {{result in a}} majority wishing to proceed with a work stoppage. However, this cannot occur during the term of an agreement, only once it expires. The union (for strikes) or the employers (for <b>lockouts)</b> must give the Minister of Labour 72 hours' notice before the work stoppage can occur. The Minister can prevent or cease a work stoppage by appointing a conciliation officer, commissioner, or board, to mediate negotiations. Section 100 of the Code sets a limit of $1000 per day is set for illegal <b>lockouts</b> or strikes.|$|R

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the <b>lockout,</b> {{a higher percentage of}} players signed contracts worth the maximum amount possible under the cap. Some young players, such as LeBron James, began signing shorter contracts that allowed for more flexibility in team choice and salary. The agreement expired in 2005, and both sides became concerned about the possibility of another work stoppage. A <b>lockout</b> was prevented, however, when a six-year CBA was reached in June 2005. After the expiration of that CBA, a <b>lockout</b> occurred in 2011; it was the fourth in league history and lasted for about five months before the sides came to an agreement. Each team's schedule in the 2011–12 NBA season was cut by 16 games.|$|E

5|$|The 1998–99 NBA <b>lockout</b> was {{the third}} <b>lockout</b> of four {{in the history of}} the National Basketball Association (NBA).

NBA owners reopened the league's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in March 1998, seeking changes to the league's salary cap system and a ceiling on individual player salaries. The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) opposed the owners' plans and wanted raises for players who earned the league's minimum salary. After the two sides failed to reach an agreement, the owners began the <b>lockout.</b>|$|E
40|$|Virtually {{unheard of}} since the Great Depression, <b>lockouts</b> have reemerged {{strongly}} in Australia and New Zealand {{just as they}} have all but disappeared in Germany. The decline of <b>lockouts</b> in Germany is convincingly attributed to the enhanced vulnerability of firms to stoppages in certain circumstances amid globalization, but the small, open economies of Australia and New Zealand are equally subject to these pressures. Using macro- and micro-level data, this arti-cle illustrates that neoliberal legislative reforms and institutional change have reconfigured the risks, costs, and payoffs associated with <b>lockouts</b> amid glob-alization. In doing so, some flaws in the varieties of capitalism/dual conver-gence literature are highlighted. In particular, the post hoc classification of the antipodes as liberal market economies bypasses the role of legislative reform in reconstituting employer interests and the differences in electoral, party, and state structures that impeded/facilitated the rise of neoliberal reformers in Germany and the antipodes...|$|R

40|$|Regulating late-night alcohol {{sales to}} prevent {{violence}} {{continues to be}} hotly debated in Australia. From July this year, Queensland required premises to stop serving alcohol (last drinks) by 3 am in entertainment precincts and by 2 am {{in the rest of}} the state. The Government made legislative provision for 1 am <b>lockouts</b> in entertainment precincts but at the time of writing has not committed to introducing them. <b>Lockouts,</b> also known as one-way-doors, permit patrons to remain drinking in premises until last drinks but deny entry to new patrons. In Newcastle, New South Wales, <b>lockouts</b> and earlier closing of licensed premises were introduced in 2008. Evidence that these produced large reductions in assault informed the 2014 Sydney restrictions that are currently under review. The global research evidence for last drinks regulations is compelling: trading extensions of as little as one h increase harm, and similarly modest restrictions reduce harm. In contrast, the effectiveness of <b>lockouts,</b> a phenomenon unique to Australasia, is uncertain. The Newcastle, Sydney and Queensland reforms are a stepwise progression in alcohol harm countermeasures, a welcome example of evidence-based public policy. However, the aetiologies of these policy changes were complex. I present accounts of each and offer commentary on the interplay between scientific evidence, public health advocacy, politics, and chance occurrences that preceded these significant changes...|$|R
