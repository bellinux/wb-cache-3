5|$|The film used Technicolor's Oz process during post-production. This is {{a partial}} silver {{retention}} on the interpositive, similar to bleach bypass, {{which will be}} used to lend to the sense of detachment from the modern world McG was looking for. Industrial Light & Magic developed shader programs to make the desaturated lighting of the CGI realistic and well-integrated to the on-set footage. The filmmakers consulted with many scientists about the effects of an abandoned world and nuclear winter. McG cited , the original Star Wars trilogy and Children of Men, as well as the novel The Road, as his visual influences. He instructed his cast to read the latter as well as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? <b>Like</b> <b>Children</b> of Men, McG would storyboard scenes so that it would be edited together to resemble a seamless, continuous shot. It took two weeks to film a two-minute shot of Connor getting caught up in a bombing on the Skynet base where he discovers plans for the T-800.|$|E

Siouxsie explained: [...] "It's about the cruelty of children and that whole aspect of being thrown out into the playground in the winter in howling gales and left to fend for yourself. It's {{not the sort of}} thing you're supposed to write pop songs about". It was the band's third single {{in less than a year}} and [...] "probably the best", according to the music historian Clinton Heylin.

One of Cardus's notices in 1937 so incensed Beecham that he announced he would not conduct any concert at which Cardus was present. Cardus later numbered Beecham, with Elgar and Delius, as [...] "one of the three most original spirits known in English music since Purcell". The annual Salzburg Festival became a highlight of Cardus's musical calendar; in 1936 he saw Toscanini conduct a performance there of Wagner's Die Meistersinger that, he said, [...] "will remain in the mind for a lifetime... Toscanini held us <b>like</b> <b>children</b> listening to a tale told in the chimney corner, lighted by the glow of olden times".

500|$|From 1976 to 1979, {{the group}} lived in campgrounds, {{usually in the}} Rocky Mountains or Texas. Applewhite and Nettles began to place greater demands on their followers' {{heretofore}} loosely structured lives, which improved membership retention. They typically communicated with their disciples in writing or through assistants. Increasingly, they emphasized {{that they were the}} only source of truth—the idea that members could receive individual revelations was rejected in an attempt to prevent schisms. Applewhite also sought to prevent close friendships among his followers, fearing that this could lead to insubordination. Applewhite and Nettles insisted that their followers practice what they referred to as [...] "flexibility": strict obedience to their often shifting requests. The two leaders limited the group's contacts with those outside the movement, even some who may have been interested in joining, ostensibly to prevent infiltration from hostile parties. In practice, this made their followers completely dependent upon them. Applewhite instructed his disciples to be <b>like</b> <b>children</b> or pets in their submission—their sole responsibility was to obey their leaders. Members were encouraged to constantly seek Applewhite's advice and often ask themselves what their leaders would do when making a decision. To his followers, he did not seem dictatorial: many of them found him laid back and fatherly. In his 2000 study of the group, Winston Davis states that Applewhite mastered the [...] "fine art of religious entertainment", noting that many of his disciples seemed to enjoy their service. Applewhite organized seemingly arbitrary rituals that were intended to instill a sense of discipline in his followers; he referred to these tasks as [...] "games". He also watched science-fiction television programs {{with the rest of the}} group. Rather than issue direct commands, he attempted to express his preferences and nominally offer his disciples a choice. He emphasized that students were free to disobey if they chose, in what Lalich dubs the [...] "illusion of choice".|$|E

40|$|Mutations in the NSDHL gene, which encodes the {{cholesterol}} biosynthetic enzyme 3 beta hydroxyl-sterol dehydrogenase, {{are responsible}} for rare X-linked congenital disorders <b>like</b> <b>CHILD</b> syndrome. The membrane bound enzyme potentially performs a previously unidentified farnesol dehydrogenase activity to catalyze {{the transformation of the}} isoprenyl alcohol farnesol to the isoprenyl aldehyde farnesal. To test this hypothesis, we have expressed and purified recombinant full length, truncated, and mutated forms of the enzyme. The enzymes will be analyzed for activity using spectrofluorimetric assays to assess substrate specificity and catalytic rates. Our results may illuminate novel roles for farnesol in the pathology of rare X-linked disorders <b>like</b> <b>CHILD</b> syndrome and may be valuable in the development of novel treatments for this disease...|$|R
