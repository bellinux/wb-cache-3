5|$|While he was {{instrumental}} in the academic exploration of his techniques (he compiled two treatises: the later one in five volumes was substantially complete when he died and was published posthumously), and was himself a master of music analysis, he considered the development and study of techniques a means to intellectual, aesthetic, and emotional ends. Thus Messiaen maintained that a musical composition must be measured against three separate criteria: it must be interesting, beautiful to <b>listen</b> <b>to,</b> <b>and</b> it must touch the listener.|$|E
5|$|A year later, {{the band}} decided {{to enter into}} a battle of bands contest, which {{included}} over 250 musical ensembles. The music competition's prize was $3,000 and two days in a recording studio. The band then decided it was time for another guitarist, to fill in some of that empty sounds during guitar solo's and to add to the band for a more full sound live. Through friends, Barrales contacted guitarist Juan Juarez and asked him to join Bonded by Blood. Juarez accepted and he then met the rest of the members and they all liked him as well. After winning round after round, Bonded by Blood finally won first place. The band then recorded the demo Four Pints of Blood at Love Juice Labs in the Californian city of Riverside. With this demo, Bonded by Blood gave people something to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> it gave the band an audience.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the show}} was a bigger hit in prime time, Moore always {{preferred}} the daytime housewife audience. He thought that it gave the lonely housewives something to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> watch while they worked. The show provided a break into show business for many performers, including Alan King, Jonathan Winters, Carol Burnett, and Dorothy Loudon. The Garry Moore Show featured regular supporting cast members Durward Kirby, Marion Lorne, Denise Lor, and Ken Carson, {{as well as a}} mixture of song-and-dance routines and comedy skits, and introduced the public to comedian Carol Burnett. After the show ended, Burnett became a star in her own right, hosting The Carol Burnett Show for many years.|$|E
40|$|Humans imitate {{each other}} during social interaction. This {{imitative}} behavior streamlines social interaction and aids in learning to replicate actions. However, the effect of imitation on action comprehension is unclear. This study investigated whether vocal imitation of an unfamiliar accent improved spoken-language comprehension. Following a pretraining accent comprehension test, participants were {{assigned to one of}} six groups. The baseline group received no training, but participants in the other five groups <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> accented sentences, <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> repeated accented sentences in their own accent, <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> transcribed accented sentences, <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> imitated accented sentences, or <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> imitated accented sentences without being able to hear their own vocalizations. Posttraining measures showed that accent comprehension was most improved for participants who imitated the speaker’s accent. These results show that imitation may aid in streamlining interaction by improving spoken-language comprehension under adverse listening conditions...|$|R

5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and {{her mother}} visit her brother Bill and his {{pregnant}} wife Tara around Christmas time. Scully answers the phone, and {{the person on the}} other line, who sounds just like her dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces the call to a nearby home in San Diego where a group of cops are investigating the suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. The lead detective, Kresge, tells Scully that it was impossible for Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the telephone call was made. That night after dinner Scully reveals to her mother that due to her abduction and cancer she is unable to bear children. Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die. Scully receives another telephone call from the same person on her cell phone, which was once again made from the Sim home. Roberta's husband, Marshall, is meeting with two dark-suited men inside his house and has no desire to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> help Scully figure out what is going on.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} seven years of his {{residence}} at Leiden his reputation was at its highest point. His literary judgement was unquestioned. From his throne at Leiden he ruled the learned world; a word from him could make or mar a rising reputation, and {{he was surrounded by}} young men eager to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> profit from his conversation. He encouraged Grotius when only a youth of sixteen to edit Capella. At the early death of the younger Douza he wept as at that of a beloved son.

He was the Emperor (Khagan) but not a dictator. Like all Mongols at his time, he was raised and educated as a warrior from childhood, and as the son of Genghis Khan, he was a part of his father's plan to {{establish}} a world empire. His military experience was notable for his willingness to listen to his generals and adapt to circumstances. He was an extremely pragmatic person, much like his father, and looked at the end rather than the means. His steadiness of character and dependability were the traits that his father most valued, and that gained him the role of successor to his father, despite his two older brothers.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile Valdobrev {{attended}} the High School for Foreign Languages in Stara Zagora. For a Communist country behind the Iron Curtain which Bulgaria {{was at that}} time, this school was like {{a breath of fresh}} air – with a discipline not so strict and teachers being lenient and having a personal approach to each of the students. They soon noticed Valdobrev's wandering mind and lack of concentration in class and created a system which tried to help him study the English language better. They gave him constant tasks to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> write down lyrics of new songs, perform them with his guitar in the lessons and translate the words for his classmates. These everyday concerts were the real productive education for him and later, when he was traveling over the Black Sea resorts and Germany as a street musician, he already had a set-list of 300 prepared and well-rehearsed world hit songs of any genre.|$|E

500|$|Guitar {{was viewed}} by Sharrock as the {{culmination}} of a period in his career spent developing his sense of composition. After releasing his first record—Black Woman—in 1969, he experimented with different influences during the 1970s. When he recorded [...] "Dance with Me Montana" [...] in 1982, the song's chord progression changed his perspective on composing and inspired him to pursue more melodic ideas. [...] "You <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> , <b>and</b> it's like a blind man struggling {{to get out of a}} room", Sharrock recalled. [...] "Guitar was a crystallization of all of the things that I had discovered in that song." [...] In the early 1980s, he had also worked on projects with Material, an experimental band fronted by Bill Laswell, who helped Sharrock produce the album.|$|E

[...] "When you talk about Japanese manufacturers, their strength (besides the quality of their equipment) was that they listened to the marketplace.
