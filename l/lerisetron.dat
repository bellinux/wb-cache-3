40|$|Abstract Background <b>Lerisetron,</b> a {{competitive}} serotonin type 3 receptor (5 -HT 3 R) antagonist, contains five functional groups capable of interacting with amino acids in the 5 -HT 3 R binding site. Site directed mutagenesis {{studies of the}} 5 -HT 3 A R have revealed several amino acids that are thought to form part of the binding domain of this receptor. The specific functional groups on the ligand that interact with these amino acids are, however, unknown. Using synthetic analogs of <b>lerisetron</b> as molecular probes in combination with site directed mutagenesis, we have identified some of these interactions and have proposed {{a model of the}} <b>lerisetron</b> binding site. Results Two analogs of <b>lerisetron</b> were synthesized to probe 5 -HT 3 R functional group interactions with this compound. Analog 1 lacks the N 1 benzyl group of <b>lerisetron</b> and analog 2 contains oxygen in place of the distal piperazine nitrogen. Both analogs show significantly decreased binding affinity to wildtype 5 -HT 3 AS Rs. Mutations at W 89, R 91, Y 142 and Y 152 produced significant decreases in binding compared to wildtype receptors. Binding affinities of analogs 1 and 2 were altered only by mutations at W 89, and Y 152. Conclusions Based on the data obtained for <b>lerisetron</b> and analogs 1 and 2, we have proposed a tentative model of the <b>lerisetron</b> binding pocket of the 5 -HT 3 AS R. According to this model, The N-benzyl group interacts in a weak interaction with R 91 while the benzimidazole group interacts with W 89. Our data support an interaction of the distal amino nitrogen with Y 142 and Y 152. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{serotonin}} type 3 receptor (5 -HT 3 R) is {{a member}} of a superfamily of ligand gated ion channels. All members of this family share a large degree of sequence homology and presumably significant structural similarity. A large number of studies have explored the structure-function relationships of members of this family, particularly the nicotinic and GABA receptors. This information can be utilized to gain additional insights into specific structural and functional features of other receptors in this family. Results Thirteen amino acids in the mouse 5 -HT 3 AS R that correspond to the putative E binding loop of the nicotinic α 7 receptor were chosen for mutagenesis. Due to the presence of a highly conserved glycine in this region, {{it has been suggested that}} this binding loop is comprised of a hairpin turn and may form a portion of the ligand-binding site in this ion channel family. Mutation of the conserved glycine (G 147) to alanine eliminated binding of the 5 -HT 3 R antagonist [3 H]granisetron. Three tyrosine residues (Y 140, Y 142 and Y 152) also significantly altered the binding of 5 -HT 3 R ligands. Mutations in neighboring residues had little or no effect on binding of these ligands to the 5 -HT 3 AS R. Conclusion Our data supports a role for the putative E-loop region of the 5 -HT 3 R in the binding of 5 -HT, m CPBG, d -tc and <b>lerisetron.</b> 5 -HT and m CPBG interact with Y 142, d -tc with Y 140 and <b>lerisetron</b> with both Y 142 and Y 152. Our data also provides support for the hypothesis that this region of the receptor is present in a loop structure. </p...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 The {{serotonin}} type- 3 receptor (5 -HT₃R) is a cation conducting ligand gated {{ion channel}} that mediates fast synaptic transmission. The 5 -HT₃R {{belongs to the}} Cys loop superfamily of ligand gated ion channels that also includes the nicotinic acetylcholine, glycine and GABAa receptors. The 5 -HT₃R has been implicated in several processes such as emesis, gastrointestinal motility, drug abuse, alcoholism and nociception. Studies involving the ligand-binding domain will thus aid in development of new drugs that modulate these physiological and pathophysiological processes. The ligand-binding site of this receptor is comprised of six putative loops, viz. loop A-F. The focus of this thesis was to study the interactions of both agonists and antagonists with the 5 - HT₃R. Interactions of two agonists, 5 -HT and mCPBG, with the loop C region of the receptor were studied employing biochemical and receptor modeling studies. These studies identify novel determinants of 5 -HT and mCPBG interactions with the 5 -HT 3 receptor. Similar studies involving granisetron, a competitive 5 -HT₃R antagonist also reveal novel amino acids that interact with this antagonist. In order to further understand antagonist interactions with this receptor, the approach of structure activity relationship (SAR) studies was also employed to study the functional group interactions of <b>lerisetron,</b> a novel 5 -HT₃R antagonist. Taken together with data from loops A, B, D and E, these data reveal an emerging picture of ligand interactions with the 5 -HT₃R...|$|E
