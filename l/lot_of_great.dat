However, while he was [...] "not sure everything hangs together" [...] and he wished for more backstory, VanDerWerff did praise some [...] "really great moments", particularly the opening teaser. John Keegan from Critical Myth, while calling the episode [...] "a mixed bag", awarded it a 7 out of 10. He praised the entry's [...] "fascinating implications [...] the mythology hidden within the events depicted", and noted that it was [...] "well directed and acted". Despite this, he was more critical of the episode's plot and wrote that there were [...] "clear logical flaws [...] and the subject matter can be disturbing. This is an episode that falls heavily to subjective interpretation." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a largely negative review and rated it one-and-a-half stars out of five. The two called it a [...] "pale retread of The Exorcist" [...] and noted that many of the episode's elements, like the chicken-sacrificing grandmother and the Calusari members, were [...] "tremendously crass". Shearman and Pearson, however, did enjoy the episode's dialogue, praising one scene in particular where the spirit of Michael torments his mother by asking to be taken to the amusement park and ride the train that killed his younger brother.
