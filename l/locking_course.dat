Although many point {{to a lack of}} {{political}} will and preoccupation with other problems as reasons for the CFSP’s lackluster performance, there is a high degree of consensus that institutional mechanisms might play a role here. This paper focuses on these institutional problems. The first section stresses the fear of member states that they could be <b>locked</b> into future <b>courses</b> of action based on today’s decision. The greater binding nature of CFSP actions (as compared to its predecessor, European Political Cooperation), the clearer specification of CFSP obligations, the more legitimate involvement of EC actors in the CFSP, and the inclusion of controversial areas in the CFSP (chiefly security and defense policy) contribute to this fear, which leads to tense ideological arguments between and within EC actors about the proper functioning of the CFSP. The second section focuses on bureaucratic politics within EC institutions involved in the CFSP, chiefly the Commission and COREPER. The final section of the paper addresses the question of institutional reform for the CFSP, a major priority of the current Intergovernmental Conference of the European Union. It assesses proposals toward this end now circulating in the EU, and the likely outcome given the negotiating positions of the major actors (states and EC actors) involved...|$|R

In addition {{to work on the}} channels, Bow Tidal Lock was duplicated, Marshgate Lock was rebuilt further east as City Mill Lock, and a second new lock at Carpenters Road was constructed. It used up-and-over radial gates operated by winches, rather than the traditional mitre gates used at City Mill Lock. The gates were quadrant-shaped, and were raised out of the river to allow boats to enter or leave the lock. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1930 to authorise the work, called the River Lee (Flood Relief) Act, and work began the following year. The project was completed in 1935. Before the work, there had been a floodgate on the Waterworks River above its junction with the Three Mills Wall River, and a large pool, the City Mill Pool, connecting to the City Mills River and Saint Thomas Creek. Marshgate Lock was situated {{to the west of the}} junction between the Pudding Mill River and Saint Thomas Creek. It was originally built in 1864, by adding a second set of gates to Hunters Gates, a floodgate which had been built around 1847. The reconstructed lock was built on the site of the City Mill Pool, and had two sets of gates at its eastern end, to prevent high tidal levels in Waterworks River flooding the waterways to the west. It was labelled Marshgate Lane Lock on the 1948 map, but was called Ward Lock, after a local councillor, and is now known as City Mills <b>Lock.</b> The <b>course</b> of the Saint Thomas Creek was then straightened, and the original Marshgate Lock was bypassed. Pudding Mill River became a dead end when the lower section was filled in, as was most of the Three Mills Back River, and the floodgate on Waterworks River was also removed.

40|$|Transactional memory (TM) {{is a new}} optimistic {{synchronization}} technique {{which has}} the potential of making shared memory parallel programming easier compared to locks without giving up from the performance. This thesis explores four aspects in the research of transactional memory. First, it studies how programming with TM compares to <b>locks.</b> During the <b>course</b> of work, it develops the first real transactional application ¿ AtomicQuake. AtomicQuake is adapted from the parallel version of the Quake game server by replacing all lock-based synchronization with atomic blocks. Findings suggest that programming with TM is indeed easier than locks. However the performance of current software TM systems falls behind the efficiently implemented lock-based versions of the same program. Also, the same findings report that the proposed language level extensions are not sufficient for developing robust production level software and that the existing development tools such as compilers, debuggers, and profilers lack support for developing transactional application. Second, this thesis introduces new set of debugging principles and abstractions. These new debugging principles and abstractions enable debugging synchronization errors which manifest at coarse atomic block level, wrong code inside atomic blocks, and also performance errors related to the implementation of the atomic block. The new debugging principles distinguish between debugging at the language level constructs such as atomic blocks and debugging the atomic blocks based on how they are implemented whether TM or lock inference. These ideas are demonstrated by implementing a debugger extension for WinDbg and the ahead-of-time C# to X 86 Bartok-STM compiler. Third, this thesis investigates the type of performance bottlenecks in TM applications and introduces new profiling techniques to find and understand these bottlenecks. The new profiling techniques provide in-depth and comprehensive information about the wasted work caused by aborting transactions. The individual profiling abstractions can be grouped in three groups: (i) techniques to identify multiple conflicts from a single program run, (ii) techniques to describe the data structures involved in conflicts by using a symbolic path through the heap, rather than a machine address, and (iii) visualization techniques to summarize which transactions conflict most. The ideas were demonstrated by building a lightweight profiling framework for Bartok-STM and an offline tool which process and display the profiling data. Forth, this thesis explores and introduces new TM specific optimizations which target the wasted work due to aborting transactions. Using the results obtained with the profiling tool it analyzes and optimizes several applications from the STAMP benchmark suite. The profiling techniques effectively revealed TM-specific bottlenecks such as false conflicts and contentions accesses to data structures. The discovered bottlenecks were subsequently eliminated with using the new optimization techniques. Among the optimization highlights are the transaction checkpoints which reduced the wasted work in Intruder with 40 %, decomposing objects to eliminate false conflicts in Bayes, early release in Labyrinth which decreased wasted work from 98 % to 1 %, using less contentions data structures such as chained hashtable in Intruder and Genome which have higher degree of parallelism...|$|R
