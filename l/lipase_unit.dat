In brief, 0.625  mL cell free supernatant of ZS 6 culture was mixed with equal volume of 0.2  M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), pre-warm at 30  °C for 10  min. Subsequently 50  µL of 100  mM pNPB was added and incubated at 30  °C for 10  min. The reaction was kept on ice for 10  min, and centrifuge at 2000 ×g at 4  °C for 10  min. Supernatant was taken and subjected to measurement of OD at the wave length of 405  nm. The concentration of the lipase in U (one <b>lipase</b> <b>unit</b> was defined as liberating 1  µmol of butyric acid min− 1 at 30  °C, pH 7) was obtained based on the standard curve using pNP.|$|E
40|$|A rapid, {{accurate}} method {{with high}} sensitivity and reproducibility, {{and having the}} advantage of a short incubation period under constant pH, has been developed for routine measurement of microbial lipase. Assembled from readily available and economical instrumental components, the apparatus includes a pH meter, a thermoelectric heating and stirring device, a motor-driven burette, and an automatic recorder. The reaction mixture, consisting of 5 ml of a 10 % olive oil-gum arabic emulsion, 2 ml of 3 m NaCl, 2 ml of sodium taurocholate (15 mg/ml) of 0. 075 m CaCl 2, 5 ml of water, and 1 ml of enzyme solution, was adjusted to pH 8. 0 and 37 C. The pH was maintained at a constant value by automatic addition of 0. 01 n NaOH during the incubation period, which usually lasted 5 min. A <b>lipase</b> <b>unit,</b> derived from the use of this technique, may be defined as the number of microequivalents of acid liberated per minute under the specified conditions. The method was sensitive to 0. 01 units. Various organisms tested produced 0. 17 to 1. 32 units per ml of the cell filtrate.

40|$|Objectives: Pancreatic enzyme {{replacement}} therapy (PERT) is the proven therapy to substantially reduce fat malabsorption {{in patients with}} cystic fibrosis (CF). Few details of the daily practice regarding PERT and the resulting coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) are known. We therefore recorded the PERT and CFA in a large cohort of pancreatic insufficient pediatric patients with CF. Methods: We retrospectively studied 1719 completed 3 -day dietary food records, including the pancreatic enzyme intake registrations, and 1373 CFA assessments of 224 patients with CF, ages 0 - 17 years. The clinical characteristics, PERT, expressed as an intake of <b>lipase</b> <b>unit</b> (LU) per gram of fat per day and LU per kilogram per day, and the CFA were described for {{the group as a}} whole and separately for those on enteral tube feeding. Cross-sectional relationship between the CFA and the LU per gram of fat per day and LU per kilogram per day were determined for each year of age. We also addressed the effect of the interventions done in patients with CFA outcomes Results: The LU per gram of fat per day was relatively stable throughout the age groups, whereas the LU per kilogram per day fell markedly with age. The median CFA in the age group 17 varied between 86 % and 91 %, however, with a CFA below 85 % in 325 of 1373 (24 %) of the measurements. No relationship was found between PERT and CFA. The patients with persistent CFA less than 85 % had significant lower z scores weight for age and weight for height (P = 0. 01) than those with CFA at least 85 %. Conclusions: In this study population, no correlation between an enzyme dosage and the degree of fat malabsorption was found; however, a CFA below 85 % was found in 24 % of the measurements...|$|E

40|$|Pancreatic enzyme {{replacement}} therapy (PERT) {{is a major}} factor associated with achieving optimum growth and nutritional status in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with pancreatic insufficiency and consequent malabsorption. Currently in Australian CF clinics policies for the usage of PERT vary considerably. This paper highlights the current issues related to fat absorption and use of PERT in CF. It also provides evidence to support the recommendation of a PERT dose based on a standard ratio of <b>lipase</b> <b>units</b> per gram of dietary fat consumed for individual patients. A consistent approach to PERT doses will facilitate identification of patients whose PERT intake increases their risk of fibrosing colonopathy and for whom gastroenterological review is warranted. Recent reports indicate that PERT intake can be reduced with a secondary improvement in growth and nutrition status as a consequence of increased dietetic input. These Australian guidelines for the judicious use of PERT in CF should lead not only to a refinement in nutritional management of patients with CF but should also facilitate an improvement in compliance with therapy due to sophistication in patient education materials. The Australian guidelines for the use of PERT in CF if correctly applied, will also provide patients and their families with {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between PERT and nutritional status...|$|R
30|$|The lipolytic {{activity}} {{was measured by}} the increase in absorbance at 401  nm caused by the release of ρ-nitrophenol {{as a result of the}} hydrolysis of ρ-nitrophenol palmitate by the action of the lipases present in the culture medium, using a Lambda 2 Perkin Elmer spectrophotometer. To perform the reaction, the sample of culture broth was first filtered through a cellulose membrane with a pore diameter of 0.22  μm to remove the suspended solids. This filtrate was the crude extract of the extracellular lipase enzyme. We added 2.5  mL of solution A (0.1  mM phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.8, and 100  mg of arabic gum per 90  mL) to a reaction tube, as well 0.2  mL of solution B (40.5  mg added of ρ-nitrophenol palmitate in 10  mL of isopropyl alcohol). This was placed in a water bath at 37  °C for 5  min. Subsequently, we added 0.3  mL of the crude extract and vortexed for 20  s. The mixture was placed again into the water bath for 10  min; after that time, the reaction was stopped with 2.5  mL of ethanol. The liquid was filtered through a nylon membrane with a pore size of 0.22  µm and the absorbance was read at 401  nm. Comparing the result with a calibration curve allowed us to determine the amount of released ρ-nitrophenol. <b>Lipase</b> <b>units</b> are defined as the µmols of ρ-nitrophenol released per minute per ml of sample.|$|R
40|$|Pancreatic exocrine {{insufficiency}} is {{an important}} cause of maldigestion and a major complication in chronic pancreatitis. Normal digestion requires adequate stimulation of pancreatic secretion, sufficient production of digestive enzymes by pancreatic acinar cells, a pancreatic duct system without significant outflow obstruction and adequate mixing of the pancreatic juice with ingested food. Failure {{in any of these}} steps may result in pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which leads to steatorrhea, weight loss and malnutrition-related complications, such as osteoporosis. Methods evaluating digestion, such as fecal fat quantification and the 13 C-mixed triglycerides test, are the most accurate tests for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, but the probability of the diagnosis can also be estimated based on symptoms, signs of malnutrition in blood tests, fecal elastase 1 levels and signs of morphologically severe chronic pancreatitis on imaging. Treatment for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency includes support to stop smoking and alcohol consumption, dietary consultation, enzyme replacement therapy and a structured follow-up of nutritional status and the effect of treatment. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is administered in the form of enteric-coated minimicrospheres during meals. The dose should be in proportion to the fat content of the meal, usually 40 - 50000 <b>lipase</b> <b>units</b> per main meal, and half the dose is required for a snack. In cases that do not respond to initial treatment, the doses can be doubled, and proton inhibitors can be added to the treatment. This review focuses on current concepts of the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency...|$|R
40|$|The Raderecht and Moskau {{procedure}} for pancreatic lipase (6) has been modified {{for determining the}} small amounts of this enzyme present in normal blood serum. The present investigation confirmed their findings: that phenyl laurate provides a stable easily-prepared substrate of uniform composition; that the substrate is specifically split by serum and pancreatic lipase; and that the reaction product (phenol) can be readily determined by a simple and sensitive colorimetric pro-cedure. The <b>lipase</b> <b>units</b> are expressed {{in the same manner}} as are phosphataseunits; i. e., milligramsof phenol liberated per 100 ml. serum at 370 in 30 mm.

40|$|AbstractMaldigestion in cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) affects approximately 90 % of patients. As soon as pancreatic insufficiency is identified, enzyme supplementation is prescribed even with breast fed infants. A pancreatic enzyme preparation developed particularly for infants, Creon® for children (CfC), contains smaller granules {{to be administered}} with a dosing spoon (5000 <b>lipase</b> <b>units</b> per scoop). Patients and methodsIn a prospective, randomised, multi-centre study, 40 infants and toddlers received both CfC and Creon® 10000 (C 10) for two weeks each in a cross-over design. Dosing of pancreatic enzymes was continued as applied before the study. The primary endpoint was the parents' treatment preference. Secondary endpoints included coefficient of fat absorption (CFA), clinical symptoms and safety parameters. Results 20 parents (51 %) from the N= 39 intent to treat sample preferred CfC, 9 (23 %) preferred C 10, and 10 (26 %) had no preference The applied doses led to a mean CFA with similar results for both treatments (77. 8 % vs. 78. 7 %). Gastrointestinal symptoms were reported {{on a number of}} study days, and some children had abnormal results for laboratory parameters of malabsorption. Safety and tolerability of the preparations were good and all these parameters were comparable for both treatments. ConclusionThose parents who had a preference favoured CfC over C 10. Both enzyme preparations improved malabsorption to a similar degree, although the applied dosages could have been too low in some children reflected in a suboptimal CFA.

Microparticles were synthesized using interfacial assembly of lipase with (CLMP-N) and without (CLMP) nanoparticles into a crosslinked polymeric core, {{to determine the}} impact of the highly ordered system on lipase stability in extreme environments. Kinetic analysis revealed the macrostructure significantly increases the turnover rate (kcat) following immobilization. The macrostructure also stabilized lipase at neutral and basic pH values, while the nanoparticles influenced stability under acidic pH conditions.

The cultural conditions like medium composition, pH, aeration rate and incubation temperature were optimized for the production of the intracellular lipase by Rhizopus arrhizus in sake flasks. The optimization of the fermentation conditions resulted in about three fold increase in the production of lipases. This optimized medium gave 13. 5 g/dm 3 fungal biomass with 325 lipase units/g dry mycelium and bout 2. 4 <b>units</b> extracellular <b>lipase</b> per cm 3 of the broth. The fermentation was also carried out in 18 dm 3 stirred fermenter and 4 dm 3 airlift production. The airlift fermenter was found to be especially suitable for the intracellular lipase production. In it, the fungus Rhizopus arrhizus produced 375 <b>units</b> <b>lipase</b> per gram mycelium and 14. 2 g mycelium per dm 3 medium. In stirred fermenter,, however, both fungal biomass and intracellular lipase activity were comparatively low. Rhizopus arrhizus was also cultured in solid substrate fro extracellular lipase production. Different agricultural by products such as wheat bran, gram bran, rice husk, soybean meal and rice bran were evaluated for lipase production. A mixture of wheat bran and soybean meal, however, was found to be the best substrate. Additives like olive oil and the egg yolk emulsion increased lipase production. The extracellular and intracellular lipase of the mould Rhizopus arrhizus were used for the biocatalysis of esterification reactions. Free excellular lipase showed very low esterification activity (28 esterification units/g) whereas the celite immobilized lipase catalyzed synthesis of hexyl octanoate at the rate of 51 micromoloe/min/gram.
