5|$|There was a {{subsequent}} French {{effort to reach}} Martinique, launched in February 1809 before news of the British invasion had reached Europe. Three ships {{of the line and}} two disarmed frigates were sent with soldiers and supplies towards the island, but learned of Villaret de Joyeuse's surrender in late March and instead took shelter in the Îles des Saintes, blockaded by Cochrane's squadron. On 14 April, Cochrane seized the Saintes and the French fled, the three ships of the <b>line</b> <b>drawing</b> away Cochrane's forces so that the frigates could slip away and reach Guadeloupe. During the ensuing Action of 14–17 April 1809, the French flagship Hautpoult was chased down and captured, but two escaped and the frigates reached Guadeloupe, although neither would ever return to France.|$|E

25|$|Drawing is a {{means of}} making a picture, using any {{of a wide variety of}} tools and techniques. It {{generally}} involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax color pencils, crayons, charcoals, pastels, and markers. Digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: <b>line</b> <b>drawing,</b> hatching, crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, stippling, and blending. A computer aided designer who excels in technical drawing is referred to as a draftsman or draughtsman.|$|E

25|$|Having {{attended}} art college, Mercury {{also designed}} Queen's logo, called the Queen crest, {{shortly before the}} release of the band's first album. The logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members: two lions for Leo (Deacon and Taylor), a crab for Cancer (May), and two fairies for Virgo (Mercury). The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion. There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix. The whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, particularly with the lion supporters. The original logo, as found on the reverse-side of the cover of the band's first album, was a simple <b>line</b> <b>drawing.</b> Later sleeves bore more intricate-coloured versions of the logo.|$|E
25|$|By {{looking at}} a {{cylindrical}} rod can one tell whether it is twisted? If the rod is perfectly cylindrical, then the circular symmetry of the cross section {{makes it impossible to}} tell {{whether or not it is}} twisted. However, if there were a straight line drawn along the length of the rod, then one could easily say whether or not there is a twist by looking at the state of the <b>line.</b> <b>Drawing</b> a line is gauge fixing. Drawing the line spoils the gauge symmetry, i.e., the circular symmetry U(1) of the cross section at each point of the rod. The line is the equivalent of a gauge function; it need not be straight. Almost any line is a valid gauge fixing, i.e., there is a large gauge freedom. To tell whether the rod is twisted, you need to first know the gauge. Physical quantities, such as the energy of the torsion, do not depend on the gauge, i.e., are gauge invariant.|$|E
25|$|M. validus {{was first}} {{described}} and named by Maurice G. Mehl in Mehl et al., in 1928 {{on the basis}} of the holotype UW 3807, a complete skull, and the two paratypes UW 3808 and UW 3809, partial skulls, from Norian-aged Upper Petrified Forest Member of the Chinle Formation, Coconino County of Arizona. The skulls have been lost since the 1950s, and a <b>line</b> <b>drawing</b> in the original 1916 description is the only visual record of the specimen. M. validus, once thought to be the type species of Machaeroprosopus, was suggested by some authors to represent the same species as Pseudopalatus pristinus. If this is the case, the name Machaeroprosopus would have precedence over Pseudopalatus because Pseudopalatus was named in 1928, twelve years after Machaeroprosopus was named. Long and Murry (1995) erected a new genus for Belodon buceros, not knowing that it was in fact the type species of Machaeroprosopus (and not M. validus), creating Arribasuchus buceros. They also suggested that M. validus might be a junior synonym of A. buceros.|$|E

25|$|At 19:00 AEST, Tim Mander, officiating his 2nd grand final, blew time {{on and the}} Tigers kicked off. In {{the eighth}} minute the Cowboys had almost reached the Tigers' twenty-metre line on the third tackle of the set when Payne ran from dummy-half and passed inside for Rauhihi {{to hit the ball}} up and stand in the takle, {{offloading}} to Thurston who passed to Matt Bowen. Bowen then threw a deft pass back on the inside to Justin Smith who charged toward the line and threw the ball blindly back over his head before being tackled. The loose ball was picked up by Thurtson and handed to Bowen to dash the remaining few metres to the line and touch down behind the uprights. For the third week in a row, Bowen was the first try scorer of the game. Josh Hannay converted the try so the Cowboys were leading 0-6. Ten minutes later the Tigers were down at the opposition's end of the field where halfback Scott Prince on the last tackle put up a kick that came down over the try line and was taken by Paul Bowman who was about to be tackled in goal and threw a speculative pass which was not caught by his teammate and Tigers forward Bryce Gibbs was there to fall onto the loose ball near the goal posts. Brett Hodgson kicked the extra two points so the scores were even at 6-6. Cowboys winger Ty Williams crossed the Tigers' try-line in the twenty-third minute but the video referee ruled no try due to an obstruction in back play. A few minutes later, Tigers' left winger Pat Richards (whose fractured ankle required six pain-killing injections for him to defy medical opinion and play in the match) crossed in the corner but the video referee disallowed the try as the ball was not properly grounded. In the thirty-fifth minute the Tigers received a Johnathan Thurston kick on their own try line, the ball going to Benji Marshall who ran with it, splitting the defence and charging down the left side and over the half-way <b>line.</b> <b>Drawing</b> a defender, Marshall then threw a flick pass behind his back to his winger Pat Richards coming through in support. Richards palmed off a Cowboys defender as he ran the remaining twenty metres to dive over and score, finishing {{one of the most famous}} grand final plays in history. Hodgson kicked the extra two points so now the Tigers were leading 12-6. Shortly before half time the Cowboys were penalised on their twenty-metre line and Hodgson took the kick at goal but missed.|$|E
500|$|As well as lavish illumination, {{the period}} saw the {{development}} of a distinct English tradition of <b>line</b> <b>drawing</b> in manuscripts, sometimes with the addition of light colour in ink or wash (watercolour), often to reinforce ink in highlighting outlines. This is often divided into two rather different sub-styles. These also developed from continental styles [...] one of which, sometimes referred to as the [...] "Utrecht style", was influenced strongly by the presence in Canterbury from around 1000 of the Carolingian Utrecht Psalter, where each psalm is illustrated with a panoramic ink drawing full of tiny figures. The Harley Psalter from Canterbury (probably 1020s) is a copy, with differences in style such as the addition of coloured washes. Dunstan was himself an artist, as were many monks who rose to senior positions, and the earliest datable outline drawing is probably by him, and includes a portrait of him prostrating himself before Christ. This was added to a blank page in an older book, probably before his exile in 956. The other [...] "Winchester" [...] style of drawing can be characterised by detailed and agitated drapery, an effect sometimes taken to excess, but giving animation to figures. The skilled use of <b>line</b> <b>drawing</b> continued to be a feature of English art for centuries, for example in the Eadwine Psalter (Canterbury, probably 1150s) and the work of Matthew Paris, monk of St Albans (c. 1200 – 1259) and his followers.|$|E
500|$|Evans' process {{involved}} {{a number of}} steps. First, the <b>line</b> <b>drawing</b> of an illustration was photographed and printed onto block while the <b>line</b> <b>drawing</b> was engraved. Proofs of the key block were coloured by the illustrator; Evans would then [...] "determine the sequencing and register...to arrive at a close reproduction of the artist's original". Blocks were painted and engraved; one for each colour. A proof of each colour block was made before a final proof from the key block. [...] Ideally, the proof would be a faithful reproduction of the original drawing, but Evans believed a print was never {{as good as a}} drawing. He took care to grind and mix his inks so they closely emulated the original. Finally, each block was placed so as to allow the individual colours to print on the page exactly as intended. Aware of costs and printing efficiencies, he used as few colours as possible. Illustrations were produced with a base of black, along with one or two colours and a flesh tone for faces and hands. In some cases, Evans may have used as few as four colour blocks: likely black, flesh and two primary colours; the addition of yellow allowed him a greater range. Each colour was printed from a separately engraved block; there were often between five or ten blocks. The chief problem was to maintain correct register, achieved by placing small holes in precise positions on each block to which the paper was pinned. If done correctly, the register of colours match, although sometimes ink squash is visible along the edges of an illustration.|$|E
