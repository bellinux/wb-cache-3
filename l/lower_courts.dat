5|$|The Supreme Court of Indiana has {{original}} and sole jurisdiction in certain specific areas, including {{the practice of}} law, discipline or disbarment of judges appointed to the lower state courts, and supervision over the exercise of jurisdiction by the other <b>lower</b> <b>courts</b> of the state. When the Court accepts a case, it reviews the documentation of the trials in the lower court and sometimes allows oral arguments before making a decision. In some cases the justices will issue a decision without hearing arguments from either side and will base their decision solely on evidence submitted in the <b>lower</b> <b>courts.</b> The Court can order a new trial {{to take place in}} the local court, overturn the decision of <b>lower</b> <b>courts</b> and enforce its own decision, or uphold the decision of <b>lower</b> <b>courts.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Mississippi Republican Executive Opinion v. Brooks (1984), the Supreme Court summarily affirmed, {{without a}} written opinion, a lower court's {{decision}} that 1982 amendment to Section 2 is constitutional. Justice Rehnquist, joined by Chief Justice Burger, dissented from the opinion. Their reasoning {{was that the}} case presented complex constitutional issues that should have warranted a full hearing. In later cases, the Supreme Court {{is more likely to}} disregard one of its previous judgments that lacks a written opinion, but <b>lower</b> <b>courts</b> must respect the Supreme Court's unwritten summary affirmances as being as equally binding on them as Supreme Court judgments with written opinions. Partially due to Brooks, the constitutionality of the Section 2 results test has since been unanimously upheld by <b>lower</b> <b>courts.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Court has no {{original}} {{jurisdiction in}} most cases, {{meaning that it}} can only hear cases appealed to the Court after having been previously heard in <b>lower</b> <b>courts.</b> Most cases begin in local circuit courts, where the initial trial is held and a jury decides {{the outcome of the}} case. The circuit court decision can be appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals or the Indiana Tax Court, who can hear the case or enforce the lower court's decision. If the parties still disagree with the outcome of the case, they can appeal the decision to the Indiana Supreme Court. The Court can choose to hear the case and possibly overturn the previous judgment, or it can decline to accept the case and uphold the decision of the <b>lower</b> <b>courts.</b>|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of Supreme Court opinions for the American polity, scholars have dedicated little systematic research to investigating the {{factors that contribute to}} the content of the Court’s opinions. In this paper, we examine the ability of <b>lower</b> federal <b>courts</b> to shape the content of Supreme Court opinions. We argue that <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> opinions will influence the content of the Court’s opinions based on a number of factors, including the prestige of the <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> opinion author, the published or unpublished nature of the <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> opinion, the ideological compatibility of the <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> opinion vis-à-vis the Supreme Court’s decision, the type of <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> opinion, and the <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> from which the opinion emanated. Utilizing plagiarism detection software to compare <b>lower</b> federal <b>court</b> opinions with the majority opinions of the Supreme Court during the 2002 - 2004 terms, we uncover support for our hypotheses, indicating that the Supreme Court systematically incorporates language from the <b>lower</b> federal <b>courts</b> into its majority opinions...|$|R
50|$|On February 29, 2008, the Iraqi Court of Cassation (the appeals court) vacated Munaf's {{conviction}} and death sentence, remanding {{it to the}} <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> and ordering Munaf to remain in custody. The Court of Cassation found numerous irregularities in the <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> proceedings, including that the <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> failed to ascertain the role of Munaf and other defendants in the kidnapping and failed to document the statements of the kidnap victims. The Court of Cassation vacated all decisions of the <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> and remanded {{the case to the}} <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> for retrial, directing that Munaf and the other defendants remain in custody.|$|R
50|$|Confession {{of error}} {{is a legal}} {{practice}} whereby the United States Solicitor General {{in his or her}} role representing the federal government before the Supreme Court of the United States admits a <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> incorrectly decided a case and it is thereby sent back for reconsideration. By confessing error, the Solicitor General declares that the federal government's position, which prevailed in the <b>lower</b> <b>court,</b> was wrong. The Supreme Court then vacates the <b>lower</b> <b>court's</b> judgment and remands the case to allow the <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> to consider it in light of the confession of error.|$|R
5|$|The Judicial {{branch is}} headed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which serves {{over a number of}} <b>lower</b> <b>courts.</b> The Supreme Judicial Court is made up of a chief justice and six {{associate}} justices. Judicial appointments are made by the governor and confirmed by the executive council.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{rejection}} of Taylor's constitutional position, the Court did create the framework for a balancing test for <b>lower</b> <b>courts</b> to use in handling future discovery preclusion questions. A trial court must balance the defendant's interest in a robust defense with the (i) state's interest in 'efficient' justice, (ii) state's interest in excluding evidence lacking integrity, (iii) state's interest in a strong judicial authority with followed rules, and (iv) the prosecution interest in avoiding prejudice due to a defendant's discovery violation.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to regain}} a public {{position}} in the Orange Free State failed, and in 1888 Spruyt once more returned to the South African Republic. He was allowed to work as law agent in the <b>lower</b> <b>courts,</b> and – being well-known and popular – set up a successful law practice. Until {{the end of his}} life he kept a healthy interest in the affairs of the state, especially in land cases.|$|E
50|$|In some systems, an {{appellate court}} will only {{consider}} the written {{decision of the}} <b>lower</b> <b>court,</b> together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal. In other systems, the appellate court will normally consider {{the record of the}} <b>lower</b> <b>court.</b> In those cases the record will first be certified by the <b>lower</b> <b>court.</b>|$|R
50|$|A federal <b>court</b> {{overturned}} a <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> {{ruling that}} had suspended the dam's operating license in January 2016. The <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> suspension {{was due to}} allegations of human rights violations.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> {{ruled that}} the {{government}} was immune from lawsuits. The Nevin family appealed the suit {{all the way to the}} U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to overturn <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> judgments.|$|R
5|$|However, {{the work}} of most High Courts {{primarily}} consists of appeals from <b>lower</b> <b>courts</b> and writ petitions in terms of Article 226 of the constitution. Writ jurisdiction is also original jurisdiction of High Court. The precise territorial jurisdiction of each High Court varies. The appeal order is the following: tehsil-kotwali-criminal/civil courts - district - high court - supreme court.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lower</b> <b>courts</b> {{are split}} {{on whether the}} Clause {{requires}} that the defendant be tried in a judicial district that was in existence {{at the time the}} crime was committed. Some courts have held that it does. Others have held that it does not and that the district need only be ascertained prior to trial. Even proponents of the former view have found no infirmity when Congress prospectively divides a judicial district, but retains the former configuration for past offenses.|$|E
5|$|Mumbai is {{the seat}} of the Bombay High Court, which {{exercises}} jurisdiction over the states of Maharashtra and Goa, and the Union Territories of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Mumbai also has two <b>lower</b> <b>courts,</b> the Small Causes Court for civil matters, and the Sessions Court for criminal cases. Mumbai also has a special Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (TADA) court for people accused of conspiring and abetting acts of terrorism in the city.|$|E
5000|$|The mother's {{immediate}} {{appeal of}} the order terminating her parental rights deprived the <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> of the authority to enter an order granting the adoption and, thus, remanded the <b>lower</b> <b>court's</b> adoption order.|$|R
50|$|The US Department of the Interior (DOI) sought U.S. Supreme Court review. But, as DOI was {{implementing}} {{new regulations}} related to land trusts, the agency asked the Court to remand {{the case to}} the <b>lower</b> <b>court,</b> to be reconsidered with the decision {{to be based on the}} new regulations. The US Supreme Court granted Interior's petition, vacated the <b>lower</b> <b>court's</b> ruling, and remanded the case back to the <b>lower</b> <b>court.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{appellate court}} reviews issues of law de novo (anew, no deference) and may reverse or modify the <b>lower</b> <b>court's</b> {{decision}} if the appellate <b>court</b> believes the <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> misapplied the facts or the law.|$|R
5|$|The {{government}} had three branches {{that included a}} legislature, judiciary, and executive branch. The executive branch was first the Executive Committee, consisting of three members, in effect from 1843 to 1845; in 1845, a single governor position was created. The judicial branch had a single Supreme Judge along with several <b>lower</b> <b>courts,</b> and a legislative committee of nine served as a legislature until 1845 when the Oregon House of Representatives was established.|$|E
5|$|Cordray {{was granted}} a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that <b>lower</b> <b>courts</b> could not grant a stay of {{execution}} for a death row inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a referendum to mandate that appeals in death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death row inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an execution if the case is still in a state court.|$|E
5|$|Estianty and Dhani {{divorced}} on September 23, 2008. The {{separation of}} the couple, who {{had been married for}} twelve years and had three sons, Ahmad Al Ghazali, El Jallaludin Rumi, and Ahmad Abdul Qodir Jaelani, was not amicable; Estianty filed a police complaint accusing Dhani of abuse, and Dhani refused to give Estianty custody of their children, appealing to the Supreme Court of Indonesia after several <b>lower</b> <b>courts</b> ruled that the children were Estianty's. In 2011 Dhani was reportedly in a relationship with Mulan and had a child with her, and Dhani gave Estianty visitation rights in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The appeals <b>court</b> {{reversed}} the <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> and reinstated the suit against Zicari and Romano, {{ruling that the}} <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> had erred in setting aside the federal obscenity statutes, which had been repeatedly upheld in Supreme Court decisions. The appeals court pointed to previous Supreme Court opinions stating {{that the right to}} decide whether a subsequent Supreme Court ruling invalidates an earlier one belongs to the Supreme Court alone, not to a <b>lower</b> <b>court.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In some cases, an {{appellate court}} may review a <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> {{decision}} [...] "de novo" [...] (or completely), challenging even the <b>lower</b> <b>court's</b> findings of fact. This {{might be the}} proper standard of review, for example, if the <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> resolved the case by granting a pre-trial motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony.|$|R
5000|$|The writ of {{prohibition}} is issued by a higher <b>court</b> to a <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> prohibiting it from taking up a case because it falls outside {{the jurisdiction of the}} <b>lower</b> <b>court.</b> Thus, the higher court transfers the case to itself.|$|R
5|$|Historically {{influenced}} by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, {{since the late}} 19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on {{a draft of the}} German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch; with the code remaining in effect with post–World War II modifications. Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has the rubber stamp of the Emperor. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of <b>lower</b> <b>courts.</b> The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.|$|E
5|$|Its Supreme Court, {{headed by}} the Chief Justice, is {{paramount}} on constitutional issues. Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge Appellate Court. Parliament cannot overturn court decisions, but Appellate Court rulings can be appealed to the High Court of Australia. In practice this rarely happens. <b>Lower</b> <b>courts</b> consist of the District Court and the Family Court, {{both of which are}} headed by a Resident Magistrate, who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court. There are two other quasi-courts: the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board, both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rowan, who espoused the Relief position, {{was elected}} to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1822 {{representing}} Jefferson and Oldham counties. He immediately became the leader of the Relief faction in the House. When Relief partisans decided to appeal Williams and Lapsley to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which was at the time the court of last resort in the state, Rowan was chosen to argue the appeal before the court alongside George M. Bibb and Lieutenant Governor William T. Barry. Their efforts failed, however, as the Court found the measure unconstitutional, upholding the decisions of the <b>lower</b> <b>courts.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{amendment}} was challenged in court. On May 16, 2006 a <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> in Georgia {{struck down the}} amendment, but on July 7, 2006 the Supreme Court of Georgia overturned the <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> thus leaving the amendment {{as part of the}} Georgia Constitution.|$|R
5000|$|Alternatively, {{it may be}} [...] "with instructions" [...] specifying, for example, {{that the}} <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> must use a {{different}} legal standard when considering facts already adduced at trial. It {{may also be a}} partial remand as when an appellate court affirms a conviction while directing the <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> to revisit the sentencing phase. Finally, it may remand a case upon concluding that the <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> not only made a mistake but also did not adjudicate issues that must be considered.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after he}} signed the contract, several other {{shiploads}} of rice arrived from Peru, causing the price of rice to plummet to three cents a pound. Norton tried to void the contract, stating the dealer had misled him as {{to the quality of}} rice to expect. From 1853 to 1857, Norton and the rice dealers were involved in a protracted litigation. Although Norton prevailed in the <b>lower</b> <b>courts,</b> the case reached the Supreme Court of California, which ruled against Norton. Later, the Lucas Turner and Company Bank foreclosed on his real estate holdings in North Beach to pay Norton's debt. He filed for bankruptcy and by 1858 was living in reduced circumstances at a working class boarding house.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as {{attorney}} general, White {{was in charge of}} several important lawsuits, among the most prominent being the state's pursuit of tax liabilities from railroad companies. Prior to his election as attorney general, railroads had never paid taxes in the state of West Virginia. White instituted proceedings to tax all the railroads within the state. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company obtained an injunction against the levying of the taxes, leading to a judicial test case. White argued the case first in the <b>lower</b> <b>courts,</b> and then before the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, which ruled in White's favor. The Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the ruling of the state supreme court, which compelled the railroads to pay taxes to the state.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 state {{constitutional}} amendments reorganized the Court. The constitution renamed the Appellate Court the Indiana Court of Appeals. With {{the formation of}} the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court could choose which cases it would hear and which cases it would leave to the <b>lower</b> <b>courts.</b> Constitutional amendments also lengthened judicial terms to ten years and changed the limits {{on the size of the}} Court to a minimum of five members and a maximum of nine. The method of selecting justices was changed from statewide election to appointment by the governor. The amendment also provided for a Judicial Nominating Commission to choose candidates. Justices also became subject to a retention election. In addition, the office of chief justice became permanent. Previously the title rotated among the justices. In 2004 the Indiana General Assembly created the Supreme Court Division of Administration, legalizing and expanding the role of the clerks of the Court.|$|E
5000|$|In American Federal Court systems, [...] "de novo" [...] {{can also}} {{refer to a}} {{standard}} of review for courts of appeal. Sometimes, particularly potent issues are brought before an appeals court, such as a constitutional determination made by a <b>lower</b> <b>court,</b> or summary judgment granted by a <b>lower</b> <b>court.</b> When this sort of issue is on appeal, {{the court of appeals}} will review the <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> decision [...] "de novo" [...] or from the beginning. In this process, the panel of judges for the court of appeals will review the <b>lower</b> <b>court's</b> reasoning and fact-finding from the beginning, based on the record. This is a high level of scrutiny that is more likely to result in reversal or remand of an issue.|$|R
