40|$|The {{electronic}} structure change of NiS_ 2 -xSe_x {{as a function}} of Se concentration x has been studied by Ni L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The XAS spectra show distinct features in Ni L_ 3 edge, indicating whether the system is insulating or metallic. These features can be semi-quantitatively explained {{within the framework of the}} configurational interaction cluster model (CICM). In the S-rich region, relatively large charge-transfer energy (Δ∼ 5 eV) from ligand p to Ni 3 d states and a little small p-d hybridization strength (V_pdσ∼ 1. 1 eV) can reproduce the experimental spectra in the CICM calculation, and vice versa in the Se-rich region. Our analysis result is consistent with the Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen scheme that the systems in S-rich side (x ≤ 0. 5) are a charge transfer insulator. However, it also requires that the Δ value must change abruptly in spite of the small change of x near x= 0. 5. As a possible microscopic origin, we propose a percolation scenario where a <b>long</b> <b>range</b> <b>connection</b> of Ni[(S,Se) _ 2]_ 6 octahedra with Se-Se dimers plays a key role to gap closure.

40|$|Constant {{development}} of software requires updating our Internet of Things (IoT) devices regularly. Some {{services such as}} transportation, health care, surveillance and electronic payments require high availability, even during a software update. IoT updates in urban scenarios require connectivity based on the Internet Protocol (IP) and <b>long</b> <b>range</b> <b>connection</b> with adequate speed. Normally, these requirements are provided by cellular network (i. e., using a SIM card) to connect to the Internet. This option presents several disadvantages: it is very expensive and it exposes IoT devices to security threats due to the permanent connection to the Internet. These challenges could be addressed by leveraging long-range broadcast communication (e. g., FM broadcast). IoT devices periodically listen for and receive updates through such a communication infrastructure, without actually being connected to the Internet. This thesis presents a system to provide software updates for IoT devices through long-range broadcast communication technologies. A prototype has been developed based {{on the concept of}} “seamless updates”. This allows performing software updates in the background, hence ensuring the availability of a device during the installation time of an update. This seamless update process was implemented on an embedded device (i. e., a Raspberry Pi 3) with a Linux-based operating system. Furthermore, a web-based backend has been implemented. Such a backend allows IoT developers to upload their updates targeting a specific class of devices and schedule when the update will be sent. The security goals of integrity and authentication are accomplished by signing the updates in the backend and verifying it at the IoT device. Moreover, a performance evaluation is performed for the system upgrade service with different parameters to sign the updates...|$|E

Neuronal cortical connectivity, however, shows a complex spatial pattern composed of local and remote patchy connections. We ask to what extent such geometric traits influence the 'idle' dynamics of 2 d cortical network models composed of conductance-based integrate-and-fire neurons. In contrast to the typical one squared millimeter used in most studies, we employ an enlarged spatial set-up of 25 mm&# 178; to provide for <b>long</b> <b>range</b> <b>connections.</b> Our models <b>range</b> from purely random to distance-dependent connectivities including patchy projections, i. e., spatially clustered synapses.

Depending on the input parameters, different dynamical states appear, similar to the known synchronous regular 'SR' or asynchronous irregular 'AI' firing in random networks. Our structured networks, however, exhibit shifted and sharper transitions, {{as well as more}} complex activity patterns. Distance-dependent connectivity structures induce a spatio-temporal spread of activity, e. g., propagating waves, that random networks cannot account for. Spatially and temporally restricted activity injections reveal that a high amount of local coupling induces rather unstable AI dynamics.

The con-straints form a convex {{set and the}} convex image segmentation problem with a total variation regularizer can be solved to global optimality in a primal-dual framework. Efficiency is achieved by directly computing the update of the primal variable via a projection onto the constraint set, which results in a special quadratic programming problem similar to the problems studied as isotonic regression methods in statistics, which can be solved with O(n logn) complexity. We show that especially for segmentation problems with <b>long</b> <b>range</b> <b>connections</b> this method is by or-ders of magnitudes more efficient, both in iteration number and runtime, than solving the dual of the constrained optimization problem. Experi-ments validate the usefulness of connectivity constraints for segmenting thin structures such as veins and arteries in medical image analysis. ...|$|R
