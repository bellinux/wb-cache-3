5|$|Bart and Marge {{take the}} <b>lizards</b> to the Springfield Birdwatching Society. Principal Skinner, {{a member of}} the society, {{explains}} that they are Bolivian tree <b>lizards,</b> a type of lizard that steals a bird’s eggs and leaves their own eggs to be watched after by the mother bird, which is then eaten by the offspring once they hatch. Skinner says the <b>lizards</b> must be killed by law, because they have killed many bird species. Bart escapes and runs away with the <b>lizards,</b> but before he can get away, Skinner catches up to him and they both struggle on top of the building. Suddenly, the <b>lizards</b> glide to the ground, where they start to eradicate pigeons in Springfield.|$|E
5|$|Chirpy Boy and Bart Junior were Bart's pet <b>lizards.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Lizards</b> have skulls {{with only}} one fenestra on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly {{attached}} which allows the mouth to open wider. <b>Lizards</b> are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. <b>Lizards</b> have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.|$|E

5|$|Many {{habitats}} in {{the monument}} support populations of snakes and <b>lizards.</b> Southern alligator and western fence <b>lizards</b> are common; others that live here include short-horned and common side-blotched <b>lizards</b> and western skinks. Garter and gopher snakes and western yellow-bellied racers frequent floodplains and canyon bottoms. Rattlesnakes, though venomous, are shy and usually flee before being seen. The springs and seeps {{in the park}} contain isolated populations of western toads, American spadefoot toads, Pacific tree frogs, and long-toed salamanders.|$|E

5|$|The park's 36 reptile species include desert tortoises, diamondback rattlesnakes (one of {{the more}} {{commonly}} seen snakes), coral snakes, Gila monsters, short-horned <b>lizards,</b> spiny <b>lizards,</b> and zebra-tailed <b>lizards.</b> Despite the aridity, three amphibian species inhabit the park: the canyon tree frog, the lowland leopard frog, and Couch's spadefoot, which lives in underground burrows, emerging to breed during summer rains. Forest fires, which create erosion-prone burned areas, have destroyed many of the leopard frog's breeding pools, which fill with sediment. The Arizona Game and Fish Department lists the lowland leopard frog as a species of special concern.|$|E

5000|$|The eastern fence <b>lizard</b> (Sceloporus undulatus) is a {{medium-sized}} species of <b>lizard</b> found along forest edges, rock piles, and rotting logs or stumps {{in the eastern}} United States.

5|$|A few {{vertebrate}} {{species such}} as the Texas horned lizard are able to shoot squirts of blood from their eyes, by rapidly increasing the blood pressure within the eye sockets, if threatened. Because an individual may lose up to 53% of blood in a single squirt, this is only used against persistent predators like foxes, wolves and coyotes (Canidae), as a last defence. Canids often drop horned <b>lizards</b> after being squirted, and attempt to wipe or shake the blood out of their mouths, suggesting that the fluid has a foul taste; they choose other <b>lizards</b> if given the choice, suggesting a learned aversion towards horned <b>lizards</b> as prey.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage uses any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, disruptive coloration, shadow elimination, self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and color. Animals such as the flat-tail horned lizard of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and {{blend in with the}} ground. The bodies of these <b>lizards</b> are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the <b>lizards</b> to effectively hide their shadows. Additionally, these <b>lizards</b> hide any remaining shadows by pressing their bodies to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Forest cobras {{will feed}} {{on a wide}} variety of prey, {{including}} amphibians, fish, other snakes, monitor <b>lizards</b> and other <b>lizards,</b> bird eggs, rodents, and other small mammals. It has been recorded as taking mudskippers, and in west Africa, one specimen had eaten a Gifford's giant shrew, an insectivore with a smell so noxious, most other snakes would not touch it.|$|E

40|$|Three {{different}} <b>lizard</b> {{species can}} be found at the great pasture of Hajúbagos. These are the balkan or crimean wall <b>lizard</b> (Podarcis taurica), the sand <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta agilis) and the green <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta viridis). All of them are protected by law in Hungary but while sand <b>lizard</b> and green <b>lizard</b> is common all over the country, the amount of the balkan wall <b>lizard</b> is decreasing. The main cause of this regrettable possession is the habitat degradation and thus habitat loss. Namely balkan wall <b>lizard</b> not only prefers but suffers open sand grasslands and these kinds of habitats are disappearing in Hungary. Due to the fact that the extensive animal grazing lost its importance, open sand pastures started to change, succession can be realized. Thus grass closing constantly what is favourable for sand <b>lizard</b> and green <b>lizard.</b> Furthermore sand <b>lizard</b> and balkan wall <b>lizard</b> share roughly the same food source and moreover green <b>lizard</b> could possibly pass into a predator of balkan wall <b>lizard</b> juveniles also. Therefore sand <b>lizard</b> and green <b>lizard</b> became competitors (or predators) of balkan wall <b>lizard</b> and the proportion of the three species compared to each other is changing. My aim is to examine the vegetation change and simultaneously monitor the amount of the mentioned three <b>lizard</b> species. After all I would like to make a well established proposal on the management of protected grasslands...|$|R

5|$|The {{adaptability}} and opportunistic diet of the willie wagtail {{have probably}} assisted it in adapting to human habitation; it eats {{a wide variety}} of arthropods, including butterflies, moths, flies, beetles, dragonflies, bugs, spiders, centipedes, and millipedes, and has been recorded killing small <b>lizards</b> such as skinks and geckos in a study in Madang on Papua New Guinea's north coast. The tailbones of these <b>lizards</b> have been found in their faeces although it is unclear whether the whole animal was eaten or merely the tail. Either way, <b>lizards</b> are only a very occasional prey item forming between 1 and 3% of the total diet. Evidence from the study in Madang suggested that the willie wagtail selectively fed nestlings larger prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{gull-billed tern}} is an opportunist predator, taking {{a wide variety}} of prey from marine, {{freshwater}} and terrestrial habitats. Depending on what is available it will eat small crabs, fish, crayfish, grasshoppers and other large insects, <b>lizards</b> and amphibians. Warm-blooded prey includes mice and the eggs and chicks of other beach-breeding birds; least terns, little terns and members of its own species may be victims. The greater crested tern will also occasionally catch unusual vertebrate species such as agamid <b>lizards</b> and green sea turtle hatchlings, and follows trawlers for discards.|$|E
