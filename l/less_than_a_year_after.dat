5|$|The {{development}} of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines began at Troika Games in November 2001. The developers {{wanted to put}} a role-playing game in a first-person setting, believing that the genre had become stale. Troika approached publisher Activision with its idea; Activision suggested using the Vampire: The Masquerade license used a year earlier in Nihilistic Software's , which had experienced sufficient success to merit a sequel. Instead of developing a sequel to Redemption, the development team researched the White Wolf property, including the game's rules and its storylines. Troika was a small game studio, with five developers and a total staff of thirty-two (including lead writer Brian Mitsoda, who joined the team <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> development began).

She was later commissioned into the Royal Navy under the same name and remained in the Caribbean. <b>Less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> her capture, a French convoy to Guadeloupe recaptured and destroyed Junon; the British subsequently intercepted and defeated the convoy in turn.|$|E
5|$|As time passed, the {{releases}} of new CD-based consoles {{such as the}} 3DO Interactive Multiplayer rendered the Sega CD technically obsolete, reducing public interest in the add-on. In late 1993, <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> the system's launches in North America and Europe, the gaming media reported that Sega was no longer accepting in-house development proposals for the Mega-CD in Japan. In early 1995, Sega shifted its focus to the Sega Saturn and discontinued all advertising for Genesis hardware, including the Sega CD. Sega officially discontinued the add-on {{in the first quarter}} of 1996, saying that it needed to concentrate on fewer platforms and felt the Sega CD could not compete in the current marketplace due to its high price tag and outdated single-speed drive. The last two games scheduled to be released for the Sega CD, Myst and Brain Dead 13, were subsequently cancelled. 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold worldwide, including 400,000 in Japan.|$|E

Improvements to Intel's mobile processors, along with a decision by Microsoft to remove OEM license fees for Windows on devices with screens smaller than 9 inches, spurred a market for low-end Wintel tablets running the full Windows 8 platform. These devices largely cannibalized Windows RT; vendors began phasing out their Windows RT devices due to poor sales, and <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> its release, Microsoft suffered a US$900 million loss that was largely blamed on poor sales of the ARM-based Surface tablet and unsold stock.|$|E
5|$|Frazee {{sold the}} rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a {{baseball}} player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner {{that he was getting}} the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, as <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>after,</b> he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.|$|E
5|$|In 1532, Pedro de Alvarado, {{governor}} of Guatemala, was issued with royal authorisation {{to conquer the}} general area of Higueras, {{in order to establish}} a Caribbean port for Guatemala. <b>Less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> permission was given to Alvarado, then {{governor of}} Honduras and Higueras, Diego Alvítez, was given royal authorisation to pacify and colonise the Naco valley and the area around Puerto de Caballos. Soon afterwards, in 1533, Francisco de Montejo, governor of Yucatán, was granted governorship over a huge area extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Ulúa River, Naco and Puerto de Caballos, so long as neither Alvarado nor Alvítez had established themselves in those regions. At the same time, Alvardo received reconfirmation of his permission to conquer those parts of Higueras that had not been pacified by the governors of Yucatán and Honduras-Higueras. Effectively, all three governors had royal permission to conquer and settle the same general region, and could interpret the royal authorisations as they chose.|$|E
