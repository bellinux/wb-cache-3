But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. If you take the money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There is a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going.

But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> didn't come to hear me play.

Manson said the maelstrom made him re-evaluate his career: [...] "There was a bit of trepidation, [...] deciding: 'Is it worth it? Are people understanding what I'm trying to say?

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the seventh season, the {{producers}} sought to re-introduce Dax but with a new host. They decided immediately that it had to be a female character, as otherwise Kira Nerys, played by Nana Visitor, would be the only female main character.

The bags were actually filled with mashed potatoes. Daniels said of the opening, [...] "There were a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> felt this was not in good taste, but to me, {{this was one of the}} most fun things about the show." [...] The restriction prohibiting Pawnee employees from accepting gifts over $25 was based on real-life municipal regulations the Parks and Recreation producers encountered during their research. The scenes filmed in the town hall outside courtyard were filmed on a studio sound stage, and the ethics board review scene was filmed inside the city hall building of Pasadena, California.|$|E

It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ...

500|$|Despite Ice-T's {{attempts}} to differentiate Body Count {{from his work}} in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image.

[...] Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that [...] "A lot of rappers {{want to be in a}} rock band, but it has to be done sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work.
