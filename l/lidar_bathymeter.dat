40|$|The {{essential}} qualities for {{a successful}} airborne <b>lidar</b> <b>bathymeter</b> are accuracy, capability, and cost effectiveness. Over the past twenty five years, developments in lasers, optics, electronics, and computers have made it somewhat easier to construct viable airborne lidar systems with varying purposes, and an increasing number are being constructed. Fewer than ten airborne lidar bathymeters exist in the world today, however, because of limited demand {{and because of the}} fact that it is still very difficult to meet the above three requirements, particularly the first. It is not hard to get answers from a system. It takes a great deal of understanding and effort, however, to obtain results that will meet international accuracy standards and the operational requirements of the typical customer. The primary considerations in the design, construction, and operation of an airborne bathymeter must be data quality and depth measurement accuracy. Both the physical environment and system hardware components contribute many error sources that must be overcome. This requires thoughtful hardware and software system design and construction, as well as the prediction, modeling, and application of appropriate correctors. Operational procedures for quality control, calibration, and maintenance must be established and followed. In this paper, we describe the large number of hardware design features, software algorithms, bias correctors, displays, an...|$|E
40|$|Ocean mapping {{technology}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly important tool in {{the full range of}} ocean-related enterprise. Moving well beyond its initial base in hydrographic surveying and nautical charting, oceanmapping has become a critical component of offshore oil exploration and development, submarine cable routing and installation, and geologic and essential fish habitat mapping. The technology of oceanmapping has blossomed rapidly in the past decade with the introduction of multibeam sonar, high-resolution side scan sonar, airborne <b>lidar</b> <b>bathymeters,</b> and laser line scan recorders. The next decade will likely see increased demand for ocean mapping data and continued demand for even more sophisticated ocean mapping technology. In response to this increased demand for ocean mappingdata and the increasing complexity of ocean mapping technology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the University of New Hampshire (UNH) have established the complementary Joint Hydrographic Center (JHC) and Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping (C-COM). The JHC is a NOAA/UNH partnership, and C-COM is a University organization with growing private sector participation. To provide NOAA and other program sponsors with the technology needed to meet their hydrographic and ocean mapping responsibilities, JHC and C-COM have developed a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary program of research. The research program of the Centers has begun with principal themes encompassing ocean and electrical engineering, computer science, and earth science. Research topics will focus on sonar system capabilities and limitations; data processing, visualization, and presentation; seafloor characterization; and other new applications of seafloormapping technology and data...|$|R
