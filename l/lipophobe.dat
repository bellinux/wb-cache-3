40|$|Abstract The multiobjective {{optimization}} {{method was}} applied {{in order to}} improve the droplet size distribution and stability of water-in-oil emulsions composed of sunflower and pumpkin seed oils as continuous phase, polyglycerol polyricinoleate as emulsifier, water as dispersed phase and sodium chloride as co-stabilizer (<b>lipophobe).</b> Three composition factors were varied based on the three level Box-Behnken design and three characteristics of the obtained emulsions were measured for each experimental run. The mean volume diameter of water droplets and the span of the droplet size distribution, both determined immediately upon preparation of the emulsion, as well as the stability index over a three-month period were interrelated by regression functions with the surfactant concentration, oil composition and the salt content in the water phase of the emulsion. Also, the fourth objective function based on a difference in the prices of pumpkin seed and sunflower oils was considered for optimization. The multiobjective optimum was calculated by using the minimal loss method with weight factors. Additionally, effects of the continuous phase composition and the salt content on the equilibrium interfacial tension of water-oil systems and the changes of the droplet size distribution over time were studied...|$|E
