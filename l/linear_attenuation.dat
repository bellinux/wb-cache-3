This in turn has the potential to improve the accuracy in radiation therapy dose planning. One problem that remains before successful material decomposition can be achieved however, is the presence of beam hardening and scatter artifacts that arise in a scan. Methods currently in clinical use for removal of beam hardening often bias the CT numbers. Hence, the possibility for an appropriate tissue decomposition is limited.

Methods: <b>Linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> coefficient was calculated with a new method that base on the physics of interaction of photon with matter, mathematical calculation and x-ray spectrum consideration. The calculation was done for Cerrobend as a common radiotherapy modifier and Mercury. Results: The values of calculated <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> coefficient with this new method are in acceptable range. Also, the <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> coefficient decreases slightly as the thickness of attenuating filter (Cerrobend or mercury) increased, so the procedure of <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> coefficient variation is in agreement with other documents.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{looks at}} the problem of {{theoretically}} characterizing the nonlinear biasing and clipping (BAC) ef-fects on an optical Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signal in intensity-modulated, direct-detected (IM/DD) optical systems. Due to the unipolarity of the IM/DD optical channel, a large DC bias and associated nonlinear clipping distortion (NLCD) is inevitable, resulting in a significant per-formance penalty. This NLCD can be well modelled as a <b>linear</b> deterministic <b>attenuation</b> plus an uncorrelated random additive clipping noise in the time domain. In the frequency domain, the NLCD results in an additive or impulsive noise on the received OFDM constellation. A total effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) formula is then presented which {{is a function of}} biasing power, modulation constellation and receiver SNR figure. This suggests that rather than eliminating all clippings, the system performance is indeed optimized with some deliberately introduced NLCD as a result of higher power efficiency. Analytical results are in agreement with simulations for various cases which help us to accurately and efficiently evaluate the performance of such systems.
