40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} the influence of carbohydrates on enrichment isolation of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria</b> from different niches. Methods and Results: <b>Lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria</b> in three traditional fermented products in southern Africa (amasi, mahewu and tshwala) and in three fresh samples (two flowers and a fruit) were enrichment cultured in media supplemented with 13 different carbohydrates. Diversity of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria</b> was determined by PCR-denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis. Carbohydrates used in enrichment media had a big impact on the isolation of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria</b> from fermented products. Depending on the carbohydrates tested, the number of species detected ranged from one to four in amasi, one to five in mahewu and one to three in tshwala. Fructose and mannitol selected for relatively higher numbers of <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria</b> in fermented products.
