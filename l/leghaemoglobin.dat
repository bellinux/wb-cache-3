25|$|The current {{hypothesis}} {{about the}} evolution of the genes needed for nodulation is that they were recruited from other pathways after a polyploidy event. Several different pathways have been implicated as donating duplicated genes to the pathways need for nodulation. The main donors to the pathway were the genes associated with the arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis genes, the pollen tube formation genes and the haemoglobin genes. One of the main genes shown to be shared between the arbuscular mycorrhiza pathway and the nodulation pathway is SYMRK and it is involved in the plant-bacterial recognition. The pollen tube growth is similar to the infection thread development in that infection threads grow in a polar manner that is similar to a pollen tubes polar growth towards the ovules. Both pathways include the same type of enzymes, pectin-degrading cell wall enzymes. The enzymes needed to reduce nitrogen, nitrogenases, require a substantial input of ATP {{but at the same time}} are sensitive to free oxygen. To meet the requirements of this paradoxical situation, the plants express a type of haemoglobin called <b>leghaemoglobin</b> that is believed to be recruited after a duplication event. These three genetic pathways are believed to be part of a gene duplication event then recruited to work in nodulation.|$|E

50|$|Leghemoglobin (also <b>leghaemoglobin</b> or legoglobin) is a {{nitrogen}} or {{oxygen carrier}} and hemoprotein {{found in the}} nitrogen-fixing root nodules of leguminous plants. It is produced by legumes {{in response to the}} roots being colonized by nitrogen-fixing bacteria, termed rhizobia, as part of the symbiotic interaction between plant and bacterium: roots not colonized by Rhizobium do not synthesise leghemoglobin. Leghemoglobin has close chemical and structural similarities to hemoglobin, and, like hemoglobin, is red in colour. The holoprotein (protein + heme cofactor) is widely believed to be a product of both plant and the bacterium in which the apoprotein is produced by the plant and the heme (an iron atom bound in a porphyrin ring) is produced by the bacterium. There is some evidence, however, that suggests that the heme moiety is also produced by the plant.|$|E
50|$|Within legume nodules, {{nitrogen}} {{gas from the}} atmosphere is converted into ammonia, which is then assimilated into amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), nucleotides (the building blocks of DNA and RNA {{as well as the}} important energy molecule ATP), and other cellular constituents such as vitamins, flavones, and hormones. Their ability to fix gaseous nitrogen makes legumes an ideal agricultural organism as their requirement for nitrogen fertilizer is reduced. Indeed, high nitrogen content blocks nodule development as there is no benefit for the plant of forming the symbiosis. The energy for splitting the {{nitrogen gas}} in the nodule comes from sugar that is translocated from the leaf (a product of photosynthesis). Malate as a breakdown product of sucrose is the direct carbon source for the bacteroid. Nitrogen fixation in the nodule is very oxygen sensitive. Legume nodules harbor an iron containing protein called <b>leghaemoglobin,</b> closely related to animal myoglobin, to facilitate the diffusion of oxygen gas used in respiration.|$|E

Ineffective Rhizobium strains (a natural nod+fix- and a pop -fix-) appeared to be useful in studying the expression of nodulin genes. Synthesis of some nodulins was repressed in ineffective root nodules, indicating that nodulins are essential for the establishment of nitrogen fixation.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} plant genes involved in the Rhizobium/legume root nodule symbiosis, host gene expression during soybean nodule development was studied. The hybridization of complementary DNA (cDNA) probes with homologous and heterologous polyadenylated polysomal RNAs showed {{that most of the}} 20, 000 - 25, 000 RNA sequences expressed were common to uninfected root and nodule tissues. There was a marked increase in the relative concentration of <b>leghaemoglobin</b> and moderately abundant nodule sequences following infection by Rhizobium. A nodule-specific cDNA probe (NS-cDNA), prepared by eliminating common root sequences by cascade hydroxylapatite chromatography, was used to characterize a small population of nodule-specific sequences. Hybridization of NS-cDNA to DNA from soybean embryos and not to Rhizobium demonstrated that these sequences are encoded by the host genome. Hybridization with nuclear RNA from uninfected tissues showed that the primary mode of regulation of these sequences is at the level of transcription. Expression of these small nodule-specific-mRNAs is differentially modulated by ineffective strains of Rhizobium. The relative concentration of nodule-specific and common moderately abundant sequences increased to varying extents, in parallel with <b>leghaemoglobin,</b> reaching a peak when nitrogen fixation commences. These data suggest that host gene expression is coordinately regulated during early nodule development. Indoleacetic acid appeared to modulate the expression of common moderately abundance sequences, but had no detectable effect upon <b>leghaemoglobin</b> or nodule-specific sequences. Preliminary characterization of 26 cDNA clones indicated that, in addition to <b>leghaemoglobin</b> and other positively regulated sequences, there were two clones whose mRNA concentration decreased during nodule development...|$|E

40|$|The coupled {{oxidation}} of leghaemoglobins with O 2 and ascorbate yielded oxyleghaemoglobin in {{the first}} reaction step, and the second step was the degradation of haem characterized by an A 675 increase. Leghaemoglobins were degraded to biliverdin isomers specifically, depending {{on the structure of}} the protein. The main <b>leghaemoglobin</b> components of Glycine (soya bean) and Phaseolus (kidney bean) were degraded to biliverdin mixtures containing about 50 % of the β-form, about 30 % of the α-form and about 20 % of the δ-isomer, whereas the <b>leghaemoglobin</b> I components of Vicia (broad bean) and Pisum (pea) were degraded almost exclusively to the β-isomer, with traces of the α-isomer. The amino acid sequences of Glycine and Phaseolus leghaemoglobins resemble each other, as do those of Vicia and Pisum. The site specificity of bile-pigment formation from leghaemoglobins can be tentatively explained by specific differences in the amino acid sequences at those regions of the polypeptide chain that are {{in the vicinity of the}} appropriate methine bridges. The ligand-binding site in different leghaemoglobins may be outlined on the basis of the present results, supposing that the haem is degraded when a reduction product of haem-bound O 2 reacts with a methine bridge of the haem, and that the bridge specificity is regulated by hindering amino acid residues that determine the location of the bound O 2. The residue phenylalanine-CD 1 appears to be further away from the haem plane or in a markedly more flexible position in leghaemoglobins than in mammalian globins. The haem-bound oxygen atom B, in Fe–O(A) –O(B), seems to be free to rotate in all directions except that of the γ-bridge in Glycine and Phaseolus leghaemoglobins, but its position in Vicia and Pisum <b>leghaemoglobin</b> I might be restricted to the direction of the β-methine bridge...|$|E

40|$|Haem oxygenases (HO) are {{ubiquitous}} enzymes catalysing the oxidative {{degradation of}} haem into biliverdin, iron and carbon monoxide. Whereas animal HOs participate in multiple cellular functions including haemoglobin catabolism, antioxidant defence and iron homeostasis, to date, plant HOs {{have so far}} only been involved in phytochrome metabolism. The expression of the HO 1 gene was studied in Medicago sativa, especially during the interaction with its symbiotic partner, Sinorhizobium meliloti. Transcript accumulation was higher in mature root nodules than in roots and leaves and was correlated to HO 1 protein immunodetection. The analysis of HO 1 expression following alfalfa root inoculation with S. meliloti indicates that transcripts do not accumulate during the early steps of symbiosis, but rather in the mature nodules. These results correlate with {{the expression of the}} <b>leghaemoglobin</b> gene, which encodes the major haem-containing protein present in the nodule. Contrary to its animal counterpart, alfalfa HO 1 was not induced by prooxidant compounds including H 2 O 2, paraquat and sodium nitroprusside, suggesting that it is not involved in the antioxidant defence.

Dinitrogen fixation in Pterocarpus officinalis, Hydrochorea corymbosa and Inga pilosula was confirmed by acetylene reduction assay (ARA), presence of <b>leghaemoglobin</b> in nodules and the N- 15 natural abundance method. The results for Zygia cataractae were inconclusive but suggested N- 2 fixation in drier microsites. Nodulated Inga disticha had a N- 15 -to-N- 14 ratio similar to non-N- 2 -fixing trees, but ARA indicated nitrogenase activity and <b>leghaemoglobin</b> was present in nodules. All bacterial strains were identified as Bradyrhizobium spp. according to the partial 16 S rDNA sequences, and they were infective in vitro in the model species Macroptilium atropurpuretan. About 35 - 50 % of N in the leaves of P. officinalis, H. corymbosa and I. pilosula was fixed from the atmosphere. Dinitrogen fixation was estimated to contribute at least 8 - 13 % and 1728 % to whole-canopy N in high and low microsites, respectively.

An indiscriminate and injudicious application of fungicides leads to their accumulation in upper soil layers of agricultural fields and exerts damaging impact on soil fertility {{as well as the}} crop productivity. The present study was therefore, navigated to assess the effect of triazole fungicide tebuconazole concurrently on common food legumes (chickpea, pea, lentil and greengram). The recommended field rate of the technical grade (active ingredient 100 % w/w) tebuconazole was used in soils. Root and shoot biomass, chlorophyll content, nodule number, nodule biomass, <b>leghaemoglobin</b> content, seed protein and seed yields of each legume were measured at an appropriate time following different methods. The recommended field rate of tebuconazole showed a varying degree of phytotoxicity to the tested legumes. Tebuconazole significantly (p= 0. 05) decreased shoot growth, <b>leghaemoglobin,</b> chlorophyll, shoot N, shoot P and seed protein in chickpea to the highest level. Generally, tebuconazole showed the most adverse effect on the growth parameters of chickpea and affected the least those of greengram. These findings demonstrated that an outcome of the effects of a specific fungicide on a specific crop plant species can not be generalized.

40|$|The {{effects of}} cobalt {{deficiency}} on nodule formation and function in sweet lupin (Lupinus angustifotius L. cv. Unicrop) were studied in cobalt‐deficient Lancelin {{sand in the}} glasshouse. Bacteroid densities in cobalt‐deficient nodules were lower than in normal nodules. Recovery from cobalt deficiency in inoculated treatments was associated with increases in bacteroid density and cobalt accumulation in lateral nodules. Such changes did not occur in treatments infected with rhizobia from the soil. Acetylene‐reducing activity of cobalt‐deficient plants was not initiated until plants were nearly 6 weeks old, at which time cobalt‐treated plants were at their peak of activity. Specific activities of cobalt‐deficient nodules remained very low even when nitrogenase did develop. Their large mass of nodules allowed cobalt‐deficient plants to reach 20 to 50 % of the normal activity per plant, but specific activities were only 5 to 13 % of peak activities in cobalt‐treated nodules. Nodule bacteroid content and <b>leghaemoglobin</b> content were linearly related to cobalamin content, each with a single relationship. Plotting acetylene‐reducing activity against cobalamin content or <b>leghaemoglobin</b> content generated two different linear response curves in each case; {{the slopes of the}} lines were different, depending on {{the presence or absence of}} cobalt.

40|$|The role of S in legume growth, N uptake, and N 2 {{fixation}} {{was investigated}} using white clover (Trifolium repens L.) {{as a model}} species. We examined whether the effect of sulphate addition on N fixation resulted from a stimulation of host plant growth, a specific effect of S on nodulation, or a specific effect of S on nodule metabolism. Clones of white clover, inoculated with Rhizobium leguminosarum, were grown for 140 d in a hydroponic system with three levels of sulphate concentration (0 mM, 0. 095 mM, and 0. 380 mM). Nodule morphological and biochemical traits, such as root length, nodule biomass and volume, nodule protein contents (nitrogenase and <b>leghaemoglobin</b> obtained by an immunological approach), and root amino acid concentrations, were used to analyse the effect of sulphate availability on N 2 fixation. The application of sulphate increased whole plant dry mass, root length, and nodule biomass, expressed on a root-length basis. N uptake proved less sensitive than N 2 fixation {{to the effects of}} S-deficiency, and decreased {{as a consequence of the}} lower root length observed in S-deficient plants. N 2 fixation was drastically reduced in S-deficient plants as a consequence of a low nodule development, but also due to low nitrogenase and <b>leghaemoglobin</b> production. This effect is likely to be due to down-regulation by a N-feedback mechanism, as, under severe S-deficiency, the high concentration of whole plant N and the accumulation of N-rich amino acids (such as asparagine) indicated that the assimilation of N exceeded the amount required for plant growth...|$|E

The role of the active site residues, in nicotinate binding was investigated. Replacement of the tyrosine 30 and histidine 61 residues with alanine, essentially removing the hydrogen-bond stabilisation to the haem-bound nicotinate, resulted in a 20 -fold decrease in affinity for nicotinate. A pH-dependent nicotinate binding study was also conducted on rLb (pKa of 5. 2) and Glu 63 Leu (pH-independent), using electronic (through determination of KdS) and NMR spectroscopy, and identified glutamate 63 as the residue regulating nicotinate binding under acidic conditions. A His 61 Ala variant was constructed to determine {{the origin of the}} low-spin haem species evident in <b>leghaemoglobin.</b> The absence of the low-spin signals in the variant, as determined using a range of spectroscopic techniques, confirmed the origin of the low-spin haem species as arising from coordination of the mobile His 61 residue to the haem. The mobility of the His 61 residue was further exploited to incorporate new haem axial ligation into rLb. Spectroscopic analysis (using electronic absorption, MCD and EPR spectroscopy) of the His 61 Tyr and His 61 Lys variants confirmed haem ligation of the new amino acids and revealed similar spectroscopic characteristics to other haem proteins containing similar haem ligation. Characterisation of the His 61 Arg variant revealed bis- nitrogenous haem ligation, however, only a tentative assignment for the haem axial ligation could be made. New reactivity was incorporated by replacement of His 61 with alanine. The His 61 Ala variant exhibited haem oxygenase reactivity, as evidenced (using a combination of electronic absorption, HPLC and MS techniques) by the degradation of haem to Fe(III) -biliverdin, via the Fe(II) - 02 and unstable verdohaem intermediates, {{in the presence of a}} reducing agent (ascorbate).

Comparison of these results with spectra obtained for the n-butylamine adduct of soybean <b>leghaemoglobin</b> {{support the hypothesis that}} lysine is the sixth ligand in the alkaline form of horse heart cytochrome c. The m. c. d. and e. p. r. spectra of horse heart cytochrome c in the presence of 1 -methylimidazole have also been examined. These studies strongly suggest that histidine- 18, the proximal ligand of the haem, is the ionizing group that triggers the alkaline transition. Low-temperature m. c. d. and e. p. r. spectra are also reported for Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome c 551. It is shown that no ligand exchange takes place at the haem in this species over the pH range 6. 0 - 11. 3...|$|E
40|$|In legumes, both {{increases}} and decreases in nodule number {{in response to}} Mo deficiency have been reported, but reasons for the different responses have not been proposed. The present study examined nodule initiation and development in black gram seedlings using two levels of seed Mo to induce Mo deficiency. In the first 11 days after inoculation, low levels of Mo in seed {{had no effect on}} nodule initiation or the number of nodules. At 13 days after inoculation, low Mo in seed depressed bacteroid concentration, <b>leghaemoglobin</b> concentration, nodule number and nodule fresh weight. Acetylene reduction activity was delayed by 2 days in plants grown from low Mo seed. We suggest that the delay in N 2 fixation in plants grown from low Mo seed was due to slower incorporation of Mo of soil origin into nitrogenase. We further suggest that restricted supply of essential metabolites to the nodules on plants from low Mo seed resulted in the slower maturation of early initiated nodules and the repression of formation of new nodules...|$|E
40|$|The pea late nodulin gene PsNOD 6 {{has been}} cloned and sequenced. PsNOD 6 is {{homologous}} to the pea early nodulin genes PsNOD 3 and PsENOD 14. In situ hybridization experiments showed that, like the PsENOD 3 and PsENOD 14 genes, the PsNOD 6 gene is only {{expressed in the}} infected cell type. The PsNOD 6 gene is first expressed at the transition of the pre-fixation zone II into the interzone II–III (the amyloplast-rich zone preceding the fixation zone III), whereas the early nodulin genes PsENOD 3 and PsENOD 14 are already induced in the pre-fixation zone II. Thus these nodulin genes encoding homologous proteins are induced at consecutive stages of nodule development. The expression of the late nodulin genes encoding <b>leghaemoglobin</b> precedes {{the expression of the}} late nodulin gene PsNOD 6. Therefore these late nodulin genes have to be regulated by different mechanisms despite the fact they are expressed in the same cell type. This conclusion is consistent with the fact that PsNOD 6 lacks one of the conserved regions occurring in the promoters of all other late nodulin genes studied...|$|E
40|$|N. m. r. -, magnetic-c. d. - and e. p. r. -spectroscopic {{studies of}} {{oxidized}} and reduced cytochrome f from charlock, rape and woad are reported. Comparison of the spectra with corresponding spectra of other haem proteins, including horse and yeast cytochromes c, bovine cytochrome b 5 and n-butylamine adduct of soya-bean <b>leghaemoglobin</b> {{support the hypothesis}} [Siedow, Vickery & Palmer (1980) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 203, 101 - 107] that lysine is the sixth ligand of native cytochrome f. Detailed analysis of the e. p. r. spectrum of ferricytochrome f indicates that its principle g-values are 3. 51, 1. 70 and less than 1. 3, and not 3. 48, 2. 07 and 1. 6 as previously suggested [Siedow, Vickery & Palmer (1980) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 203, 101 - 107]. The observation of a one-proton intensity resonance at - 3. 27 p. p. m. in the 1 H-n. m. r. spectrum of ferrocytochrome f, coupled with {{the absence of a}} methionine methyl resonance from the spectral region to low frequency of - 2 p. p. m., is suggested to be a general indicator of lysine co-ordination...|$|E
