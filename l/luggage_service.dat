40|$|Amsterdam Airport Schiphol {{suffers from}} {{capacity}} problems during peak travel seasons and times. 'Luggage services' are a recently emerged, promising innovation {{that could possibly}} help with easing luggage congestion at the airport. Consequently, Schiphol has shown interest in luggage services, but research knowledge on possible target group of users is unknown. Schiphol and Delft University of Technology are both contributing to PASSME, a EU-funded research project aiming to reduce passenger door-to-door travel time by 60 minutes and to improve passenger experience at airports. Via this programme, a Master's thesis research project was carried out that had the following research questions: 1. Who are possible users for luggage services? 2. What are the needs of these users in the current passenger journey? 3. What features should the service offer to attend to these needs? The project also had the aim {{to find out how}} the solution could improve passenger experience and cut down waiting time, alleviate the luggage congestion problem at Schiphol as well as to explain what Schiphol's role in luggage services could be. The project was carried out via a co-creation approach, having members of the target group dictate the service requirements and features, which would then be further designed and evaluated with these target users. End deliverable was a service blueprint depicting multiple level interactions taking place at various stages of using a <b>luggage</b> <b>service.</b> The outcome was that holidaying parents and seniors could be a good leading target group for the service due to bringing lots of luggage along the trip and because of reduced mobility brought by aging. Main identified user needs were having control, being informed and having trust, that a <b>luggage</b> <b>service</b> should convey via different kinds of interactions. It should offer its users options to tailor the service to each user's individual schedules and trip itinerary and keep them informed of their luggage. It should also operate under a known brand that the users can trust. Finally, it was concluded that luggage services can improve passenger experience by reducing waiting time at the airport as well as easing luggage-related stress during other parts of the holiday journey. They also have the potential to ease Schiphol's luggage congestion by diverting luggage away from the airport, although it is recommended that Schiphol looks also into other options. Schiphol itself has good potential to operate a <b>luggage</b> <b>service</b> with industry partners under Schiphol's familiar, trusted brand. PASSMEDesign for Interactio...|$|E

40|$|Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) and the Technical University Delft, faculty Industrial Design Engineering (IDE) {{are working}} {{together}} on the Personalised Airport System for Seamless Mobility and Experience (PASSME) project [...] There are two problems derived from the PASSME project. First, airport processes are not seamless, because passengers spend relatively much unwanted time at the airport. PASSME’s objective {{is to reduce the}} time spent on handling luggage by 30 minutes. Secondly, the current state of luggage check-in for passengers is experienced as negative in 21 % of the cases. It is experienced as heavy, a hassle and it creates stress. PASSME aims to improve the entire quality of experience of the door-to-door journey for at least 70 % of the passengers. During the internal research at KLM, different problems were found at the luggage check-in. Passengers spend on average 6 minutes and 11 seconds at the SSDOP and 9 minutes and 50 seconds at the CUDOP. When researching the current situation for passengers several things can be concluded. A quantitative research is performed (n= 86) to research the experience passengers have during their passenger journey with check-in luggage. From the research it can be deduced that passengers travelling by public transport, experience the journey less positively (4. 7 out of 7), than passengers who use other types of transportation (car 5. 9 out of 7, taxi 6. 2 out of 7). These passengers need to travel with their check-in luggage by train, bus, metro and other public transports to reach the airport. And this travelling on public transport with their check-in luggage, causes a more negative experience and emotions, because carrying the luggage from bus to train or storing the luggage, is experienced as not very positive. After this research it became clear where improvement was possible for passenger and airline. The experience can be improved for passengers who travel by public transport. Unwanted airport time can be reduced at the luggage check-in and at the reclaim belt. The solution is a door-to-door <b>luggage</b> <b>service.</b> The luggage is picked-up by a logistic partner at the home address of the passenger. The luggage is transported by a logistic partner to the accommodation of the passenger. This means that the luggage is removed out of the passenger journey from home to airport. The door-to-door <b>luggage</b> <b>service</b> improves the passenger experience when travelling to the airport by public transport from a 4. 7 to 6. 3. Because of this service, the passenger does not have to handle the check-in luggage anymore from origin to airport. Since this service removes the check-in luggage from the airport, the passenger does not have to spend time at the luggage check-in area nor at the reclaim area. In total, the waiting time and processing time for passengers can be reduced from 29 minutes to 34 minutes, when the door-to-door service is used.

When the Queensway road tunnel opened in 1934, the ferry service from Seacombe lost two million passengers because people started to use the tunnel rather than the ferry.

Both ferry companies earned a substantial amount from luggage boats, which carried vehicles and goods across the river. When the road tunnel opened, traffic dropped by 80%.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the service gap deployment (SGD), a new method to prioritise crucial to quality activities of {{a service that}} does not completely satisfy customer expectations.

The method, which expands the gaps model of service quality by Parasuraman et al. (1985), supports the design of evolutionary and sustaining improvements of the service parts that generate customer dissatisfaction. Specifically, the SGD introduces three major contributions: 1) it creates a map relating service dimensions to SAs; 2) it highlights crucial to quality activities; 3) it allows a focused improvement of the analysed service. The description is supported by an excerpt from a real application example, concerning the prioritisation of crucial to quality SAs of an airport <b>luggage</b> delivery <b>service...</b>|$|R
