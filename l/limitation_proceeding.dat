40|$|In this study, the {{combined}} surface status and surface soil moisture products retrieved by the ASCAT sensor within the ESA-DUE Permafrost project are {{compared to the}} hydrological outputs of the land surface model ORCHIDEE over Northern Eurasia. The objective is to derive broad conclusions as to {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of hydrological modelling and, to a minor extent, remote sensing of soil moisture over an area where data is rare and hydrological modelling is though crucial for climate and ecological applications. The spatial and temporal resolutions of the ASCAT products make them suitable for comparison with model outputs. Modelled and remotely-sensed surface frozen and unfrozen statuses agree reasonably well, which allows for a seasonal comparison between modelled and observed (liquid) surface soil moisture. The atmospheric forcing and the snow scheme of the land surface model are identified as causes of moderate model-to-data divergence in terms of surface status. For unfrozen soils, the modelled and remotely-sensed surface soil moisture signals are positively correlated over most of the study area. The correlation deteriorates in the North-Eastern Siberian regions, which is consistent with the lack of accurate model parameters and the scarcity of meteorological data. The model shows a reduced ability to capture the main seasonal dynamics and spatial patterns of observed surface soil moisture in Northern Eurasia, namely a characteristic spring surface moistening resulting from snow melt and flooding. We hypothesize that these weak performances mainly originate from the non-representation of flooding and surface ponding in the model. Further identified <b>limitations</b> <b>proceed</b> from the coarse treatment of the hydrological specificities of mountainous areas and spatial inaccuracies in the meteorological forcing in remote, North-Eastern Siberian areas. Investigations are currently underway to determine to which extent plausible inaccuracies in the satellite data could also contribute to the diagnosed model-to-data discrepancies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — An {{important}} milestone {{for building}} affordable robots that can become widely popular is to address robustly the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem with inexpensive, off-the-shelf sensors, such as monocular cameras. These sensors, however, impose significant challenges on SLAM procedures {{because they provide}} only bearing data related to environmental landmarks. This paper starts by providing an extensive comparison of different techniques for bearing-only SLAM in terms of robustness under different noise models, landmark densities and robot paths. We have experimented in a simulated environment {{with a variety of}} existing online algorithms including Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters (RB-PFs). Our experiments suggest that RB-PFs are more robust compared to other existing methods and run considerably faster. Nevertheless, their performance suffers in the presence of out-liers. In order to overcome this <b>limitation</b> we <b>proceed</b> to propose an augmentation of RB-PFs with: (a) Gaussian Sum Filters for landmark initialization and (b) an online, unsupervised outlier rejection policy. This framework exhibits impressive robustness and efficiency even in the presence of outliers...|$|R
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{suggests a}} methodology for measuring logistics costs. To achieve this, the steps were as follows: (1) {{the selection of}} a company, (2) the description of the production process, (3) the characterization of the PPPC, (4) the identification of logistics operations, and (5) the deployment of Activity Based Costing (ABC). Through interviews and visits to the factory, we obtained the following information: the company’s headquarters are located in Campina Grande, Brazil, and the PPPC features an annual planning of activities, alternating schedule between pulls and pushes, depending on the demand. Regarding logistics operations, they may be divided into three macro-processes: supply, distribution, and facilities. The main limitation of our research was the unavailability of accounting data from the company, thus compromising the direct application of the ABC method. Given the <b>limitations,</b> we <b>proceeded</b> to suggest a methodology for measuring logistics costs using ABC. We also suggest the application of various costing methods for the quantification of logistics costs, as well as the demonstration of logistical operations that occur in different production systems...|$|R

An application in the field of shape modeling of b-rep geometry (polygonal in this case) is presented, based on creating processing machines or tools which work purely through the model. The model is aimed at conceptual rapid prototyping, or similar areas where generality and simplicity are more important than metric correctness...|$|R

2500|$|Albert Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as {{proposed}} in his 1905 paper entitled [...] "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" [...] {{was built on}} the understanding of inertia and inertial reference frames developed by Galileo and Newton. While this revolutionary theory did significantly change the meaning of many Newtonian concepts such as mass, energy, and distance, Einstein's concept of inertia remained unchanged from Newton's original meaning (in fact, the entire theory was based on Newton's definition of inertia). However, this resulted in a limitation inherent in special relativity: the principle of relativity could only apply to reference frames that were inertial in nature (meaning when no acceleration was present). In an attempt to address this <b>limitation,</b> Einstein <b>proceeded</b> to develop his general theory of relativity ("The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity," [...] 1916), which ultimately provided a unified theory for both inertial and noninertial (accelerated) reference frames. However, in order to accomplish this, in general relativity, Einstein found it necessary to redefine several fundamental concepts (such as gravity) in terms of a new concept of [...] "curvature" [...] of space-time, instead of the more traditional system of forces understood by Newton.|$|R
30|$|The {{chain rule}} is a {{calculus}} concept that causes difficulties {{for many students}} (Jojo, 2014; Siyepu, 2013 a; Wangberg, Engelke & Karakok, 2010). The derivatives of trigonometric functions become complicated when they need {{the application of the}} chain rule. Literature also shows that function composition is particularly problematic for students (Engelke et al., 2005; Siyepu, 2013 a). Some students are introduced to the chain rule merely as a rule that should be applied without much attempt to reveal the reasons for and justification of the procedure (Orton, 1983 b; Siyepu, 2013 a). The chain rule concept, {{as an example of a}} schema, requires that students should already be at a well-functioning schema level for all other standard basic rules of differentiation (Clark et al., 1997; Siyepu, 2013 a). This suggests that the concept of the chain rule should be introduced only when students can operate automatically with other rules of differentiation such as the multiple constant rule, the sum and the difference rule, the power rule, the product rule and the quotient rule. According to APOS Theory, prior to the introduction of chain rule, the students should be at a schema level for the rules mentioned above. Due to time <b>limitations,</b> lecturers <b>proceed</b> to a section of the chain rule without clear evidence that students can perform independently in other prerequisite sections, such as those mentioned above.|$|R

40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of low cost RGB-D depth sensors has made available 3 D sensing capabilities to many researchers and applications developers. Although the 3 D sensing performance of these sensors {{is able to}} satisfy the needs of most common applications, there are applications, which require higher accuracy and coverage area. This thesis presents an evaluation of a low cost RGB-D sensor and proposes a multi-sensor system in order to overcome the limitations of a single sensor. The Kinect sensor {{was chosen as the}} target of the evaluation process due to its popularity, tools availability and support. The thesis started with an analysis of the 3 D sensing mechanism and operation of the sensor, identified its <b>limitations</b> and <b>proceeded</b> with a performance evaluation. The Kinect sensor was evaluated taking into account the behavior of accuracy, precision and resolution and its variation along the distance to the target scene. As a step towards the solution of the limitations of the sensor, a multi-sensor system is proposed and analyzed. The main idea is to combine the data from several sensors located at different positions in order to improve the accuracy of the information and increase the coverage of the scene. The method proposed to combine the information of the multi-sensor system is based on the Kinect performance evaluation results. An experimental testbed with two Kinect sensors has been assembled and tested. It is shown that performance strongly depends on proper calibration of the system. Method for calibration has been developed and experimentally evaluated. Results show good performance of the system. The main outcome of the thesis is the evaluation of the measurements of the Kinect sensor, an automatic calibration system for several sensors and a method to fuse the input from several sensors taking into account limitation on data precision...|$|R
5000|$|One of Newport's most {{well-known}} {{contributions to the}} field of language acquisition research is the Less is More Hypothesis. [...] In this hypothesis, Newport posits that children are better able to learn languages than adults because they have fewer cognitive resources available to them. This is advantageous in learning a complex combinatorial system such as a human language because children, given their cognitive <b>limitations,</b> will naturally <b>proceed</b> by beginning with small parts and will acquire more complex constructions only as they mature. In contrast, more competent adults will begin by trying to analyze more complexity from the start and will have difficulty finding the best analyses. [...] In her natural language studies she has shown that learners who begin in childhood show much greater ultimate proficiency in both first and second languages than those who begin in adulthood. In her miniature language studies she has shown that children and adults differ in language learning in well controlled studies in the lab, with young children acquiring regular patterns and rules even when their input is inconsistent. [...] This regularization process provides an explanation of how children may contribute to the formation of languages over generations.|$|R
40|$|Perennial {{crops are}} plants, used in agriculture, {{that can be}} {{harvested}} multiple times before replanting. They are beneficial {{in a variety of}} ways, producing food and fuel, and providing agronomic, environmental, and cultural benefits. Economic analysis of the production of perennials is complicated by the long life of these crops, and by the changing patten of productivity over the crop's lifespan. This dissertation contains three studies looking at the implications of these two facts on perennial crop production and processing. The first chapter introduces perennial crops and the history of agricultural economists' attempts to study these issues. Chapters 2 and 3 analyze perennial crop production and processing in the context of biofuel production in Brazil. Chapter 4 presents the foundation of a unifying framework that can overcome <b>limitations</b> in the <b>proceeding</b> two chapters. Brazilian sugarcane production growth, being a key feedstock to sugar and ethanol production, exhibited a puzzling slow-down in the decade starting in 2010. In chapter 2 I investigate a noted, but unexplored, mechanism to explain this slow-down: the link between credit availability, sugarcane replanting, and sugarcane yield. Using secondary sources, I establish the plausibility of the conjecture that credit restrictions affected sugarcane farmer replanting decisions. To establish the link between replanting and yield, I develop a formal model to analyze the dynamics of yield after a change in the replant rate. I test this model econometrically using data from the South-Central region of Brazil, finding evidence mostly consistent with the model. The model is able to explain around one third of the variation in sugarcane yields, implying that, while this channel is important, it alone cannot explain the production slow-down. Perennial crop field-biorefinery supply chains are necessary in the production of many agricultural products. In particular, the low-cost production of low-carbon biofuels, such as ethanol from sugarcane or cellulosic feedstocks, relies on minimizing the costs of production along a perennial crop field-biorefinery supply chain. In chapter 3 I develop and analyze an unexplored mechanism to reduce perennial crop field-biorefinery supply chain costs: adjusting the age-structure, and hence yield, of the perennial feedstock. I present comparative statics of this model, finding that smaller biorefineries are most likely to benefit from age-structure endogenization. However, the results from a simulation of this model, calibrated to the sugarcane ethanol industry in the South-Central region of Brazil and comparing the cost-minimizing to the yield-maximizing age-structure, show that the cost-reductions from endogenization are small in this case (less than 1 percent cost reduction). Generally, the magnitude of the cost-reduction will depend on the growing pattern of the crop, the costs of growing and transporting the feedstock, and the reference age-structure. In chapter 4 I adapt the theoretical framework of Mitra 1991 to a two-age-class, finite horizon model, recasting their growth theoretic model into a form better suited for policy analysis. After introducing a simplified version of the model, and its general case, I determine necessary conditions on key parameters (relative productivity of mature trees, opportunity cost of land, and farmer patience) for each qualitative trajectory type in an arbitrary period. I use these conditions to develop a proposition about planting in the final period, and to analyze an example trajectory. Finally, I propose ways that this model can be used to answer several questions about perennial crop management...|$|R
