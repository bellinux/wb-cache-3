5|$|Bastnäsite, LnIIICO3F, {{is usually}} <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> thorium {{and the heavy}} {{lanthanides}} beyond samarium and europium, and hence the extraction of cerium from it is quite direct.

The ore is then roasted {{in the air to}} oxidize it to the lanthanide oxides: while most of the lanthanides will be oxidized to the sesquioxides Ln2O3, cerium will be oxidized to the dioxide CeO2. This is insoluble in water and can be leached out with 0.5M hydrochloric acid, leaving the other lanthanides behind.|$|E
