40|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} (NaOH) is {{well known}} for its corrosive properties and its ability to generate heat on contact with water. The respiratory effects of industrial exposure to NaOH have, however, never been reported. A 63 year old man worked daily for 20 years cleaning large industrial jam containers by boiling <b>lye</b> (NaOH) <b>solution</b> without using respiratory protective equipment. Physical examination, chest x ray film, pulmonary function tests, and arterial blood gases were all compatible with severe obstructive airway disease with significant air trapping. It is probable that this massive and prolonged occupational exposure to the corrosive effect of NaOH mists induced irritation and burns to the respiratory system, eventually leading to severe obstructive airway disease...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{how we can}} do camera resectioning from a box with unknown dimensions, i. e. determine the camera model, assuming that image pixels are square. This assumption is equivalent to assuming that the camera as an aspect ratio of one and zero skew, and holds for most - if not all - digital cameras. Our proposed method works by first deriving 9 linear constraints on the projective camera matrix from the box, leaving a 3 dimensional subspace in which the projective camera matrix can <b>lye.</b> A single <b>solution</b> in this 3 D subspace is then found via a method by Triggs in 1999, which uses the squared pixel assumption {{to set up a}} 4 th degree polynomial to which the solution is the desired model. This approach is, however, numerically challenging, and we use several means to combat this issue. Lastly the solution is refined in an iterative manner, i. e. using bundle adjustment...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of olive tree irrigation, the use of salt in {{preservation}} liquids and the reuse of sodium hydroxide <b>solutions</b> (<b>lye)</b> on the weight, shriveling, firmness and phenolic content of Hojiblanca processed olives was investigated. A weight loss in fruits of up to 5 % during the preservation stage was observed, particularly for olives from irrigated trees and stored in brines. By contrast, a weight gain of up to 7 % was achieved during the darkening stage, whose intensity was increased by using fruits from non-irrigated trees and preserved in a salt-free environment as well as fresh lye for the debittering step. Moreover, shriveling particularly appeared in fruits from non-irrigated olive trees, this defect being more intense if lye was reused. Firmness was also affected by the studied variables, and natural rainfed irrigation and the reuse of lye and salt in the preservation solutions gave rise to firmer olives. The content in phenolic compounds of black processed olives was higher in fruits from non-irrigated than irrigated trees, in particular those of hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol and luteolin 7 -glucoside. Overall, these results {{will contribute to the}} knowledge of table olives processing and the industrial optimization of this sector. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Canned {{mandarin}} segments are peeled {{to remove}} the white pith prior to canning; otherwise, they turn bitter. Segments are peeled using a chemical process. First, the segments are scalded in hot water to loosen the skin; then they are bathed in a <b>lye</b> <b>solution,</b> which digests the albedo and membranes. Finally, the segments undergo several rinses in plain water. They are often used in salads, desserts, and baking.|$|E

50|$|Afterwards, {{they dress}} up in clean clothes for the Christmas dinner or joulupöytä, which is usually served between 5pm and 7pm, or {{traditionally}} {{with the appearance of}} the first star in the sky. The most traditional dish of the Finnish Christmas dinner is probably Christmas Ham, roast suckling pig or a roasted fresh ham, but some may prefer alternatives like turkey. Several sorts of casseroles, like rutabaga, carrot and potato casserole are traditional, and are almost always exclusively served on Christmas. Other traditional Christmas dishes include boiled codfish (soaked beforehand in a <b>lye</b> <b>solution</b> for a week to soften it) served snowy white and fluffy, pickled herring and vegetables. Prune jam pastries, plum or mixed fruit soup, rice porridge with cinnamon, sugar and cold milk, and sweets like chocolate are popular desserts. Christmas gifts are usually exchanged after Christmas Eve dinner. Children do not hang up stockings in Finland but Joulupukki visits the household, maybe with a tonttu to help him distribute the presents.|$|E
5000|$|During the Renaissance, {{ultramarine}} was {{the finest}} and most expensive blue {{that could be}} used by painters. The 15th century artist Cennino Cennini wrote in his painters' handbook: [...] "Ultramarine blue is a glorious, lovely and absolutely perfect pigment beyond all the pigments. It would not be possible to say anything about or do anything to it which would not make it more so." [...] Natural ultramarine is the most difficult pigment to grind by hand, and for all except the highest quality of mineral, sheer grinding and washing produces only a pale grayish blue powder. At the beginning of the 13th century, an improved method came into use, described by Cennino Cennini in the 15th century. This process consisted of mixing the ground material with melted wax, resins, and oils, wrapping the resulting mass in a cloth, and then kneading it in a dilute <b>lye</b> <b>solution.</b> The blue particles collect {{at the bottom of the}} pot, while the impurities and colorless crystals remain. This process was performed at least three times, with each successive extraction generating a lower quality material. The final extraction, consisting largely of colorless material as well as a few blue particles, brings forth ultramarine ash which is prized as a glaze for its pale blue transparency.|$|E

40|$|During {{the removal}} of free fatty acids from edible oils by {{extraction}} with a <b>lye</b> <b>solution</b> (i. e. alkali neutralization) considerable amounts of neutral oil are lost. These losses can only partly {{be accounted for by}} saponification and/or imperfect separation of the two phases after extraction. A previous investigation by Seip shows that there is a relation between the interfacial turbulence which occurs during this extraction process and these oil losses. His conclusion is that the losses are caused by spontaneous emulsification which is due to the occurence of interfacial turbulence. The present study has been initiated to check the validity of the above hypothesis and to investigate the (quantitative) relation between interfacial turbulence and oil losses, in particular the influence of several process parameters.

30|$|The constituting {{elements}} of ultramarine, a complex sulfur-containing sodium-silicate, {{are difficult to}} detect by in situ MA-XRF scanning as the emitted low-energy fluorescence are easily absorbed by ambient air or superimposed paint and varnish layers. However, the presence of ultramarine can often be visualized in rich blue areas through the distribution of potassium, an impurity from the lapis lazuli stone that was left from the production process. To obtain purified ultramarine, the ground lapis lazuli is mixed with wax and kneaded in a dilute <b>lye</b> <b>solution</b> of potassium carbonate [33]. However, potassium {{can be found in}} other painting materials, such as the substrate of lakes, smalt or earth pigments, which complicates interpretation. Sometimes, its source can be deduced based on color, but in this case, a cross-section was available to ascertain ultramarine particles in the red lake glaze.|$|E
40|$|Pretzel {{production}} includes alkali dipping {{prior to}} baking to gelatinize the starch {{at the surface}} and to result in the desired smooth surface of the final product. Hard pretzels are typically dipped in 1. 0 % NaOH at a temperature of about 90 °C for 10 to 60 s. Chemical changes during this treatment also result in the unique taste, and color of the end product. However, alkali treatment may also result in protein degradation and affect nutritional quality. Model system studies recently showed that beta-elimination reaction of cystine occurs when gluten proteins are heated at alkaline pH. As a follow up to that study, {{the objective of the}} present work was to investigate whether an alkaline treatment typical for that during pretzel production, would also affect the gluten at the surface of the product. Gluten/water dough and pretzel dough were dipped in NaOH solution [0. 5, 1. 0, or 1. 5 % (w/v) ] for different times (30, 45, and 60 s) and at different temperatures (50, 65, 80, and 95 °C), and subsequently baked. Protein extractability and levels of intermediate and end products of beta-elimination reactions of cystine were determined in the dough before and after the alkali dip, and after baking. Protein extractabilities decreased during pretzel production, even after reduction of disulfide bonds, which indicated that some non-disulfide cross-links were formed. Further investigation showed that beta-elimination from cystine resulted in the formation of dehydroalanine, which reacted with cysteine and lysine to lanthionine and lysinoalanine, respectively. It was concluded that the concentration and temperature of the <b>lye</b> <b>solution</b> and the dipping time impact protein cross-linking and beta-elimination reactions during laboratory scale pretzel production. status: accepte...|$|E
