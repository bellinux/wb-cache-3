50|$|The {{above-mentioned}} {{competition between}} NGL and the recurring extension of photolithography, where the latter consistently wins, {{may be more}} a strategic than a technical matter. If a highly scalable NGL technology were to become readily available, late adopters of <b>leading-edge</b> <b>technology</b> would immediately {{have the opportunity to}} leapfrog the current use of advanced but costly photolithography techniques, {{at the expense of the}} early adopters of <b>leading-edge</b> <b>technology,</b> who have been the key investors in NGL. While this would level the playing field, it is disruptive enough to the industry landscape that the leading semiconductor companies would probably not want to see it happen.|$|E

5000|$|This {{becomes more}} clear when {{considering}} that each resolution enhancement technique applied to photolithography generally extends the capability {{by only one}} or two generations. For this reason, the observation that [...] "optical lithography will live forever" [...] will likely hold, as the early adopters of <b>leading-edge</b> <b>technology</b> will never benefit from highly scalable lithography technologies in a competitive environment.|$|E

50|$|In 1994, some ISPs {{started to}} offer TCP/IP {{connections}} via dial-in modems, with protocols like SLIP and PPP. But this was <b>leading-edge</b> <b>technology,</b> {{and so it}} was extraordinarily difficult to set up and maintain a home TCP/IP connection.

5000|$|<b>Leading-edge</b> <b>technology</b> is uniformly and attractively {{packaged}} {{in all three}} BlueZERO variants. The unique and distinctive Mercedes design idiom displayed by the body highlights the progressive nature of Concept BlueZERO straight away. The powerfully elegant front end {{is dominated by the}} radiator grille with its centrally located star. The excellent aerodynamics of the BlueZERO are partly due to the closed front apron, whose design means that cooling air intakes are not required. The 20-inch wheels have also been aerodynamically optimized, while low-friction tires reduce rolling resistance. The striking character lines along the flanks lend the BlueZERO an extremely dynamic side line and accentuate its nature inspired structure. Some argue that Mercedes took a page from the BMW styling handbook with its bionic look.|$|E
5000|$|Land Rover {{originally}} developed HDC {{for use on}} their Freelander model which lacks the low range gears usually provided on 4x4 vehicles. At {{the time it was}} derided by enthusiasts, and many claimed its set speed was too high for a controlled descent in difficult conditions. Despite the critics, the system was a <b>leading-edge</b> <b>technology</b> and allowed the Freelander, coupled with the Traction Control system, to be renowned for astounding offroading performance that set it apart in the category of the so-called [...] "soft roaders" [...] produced in the 90s.

40|$|International audienceTechnological superiority is a {{key element}} to achieve defense effectiveness, and R&D {{spending}} is crucial to access <b>leading-edge</b> <b>technologies.</b> Nevertheless, the current defense R&D model seems to reach its limits, leading to an out-of-control burden: In spite of spending almost USD 70 billion yearly, defense R&D in NATO countries does not produce the expected results. This low effectiveness leads to criticism about today's model of defense R&D, especially the channeling of credits by large incumbents through the Lead System Integrator model. Spurring disruptive technologies and path-breaking innovation requires an alternative approach. It is then interesting to analyze the possible use of venture-capital mechanisms to complement the mainstream approach to defense R&D. Even though the article does not develop a full analysis of the relationship between defense R&D and the principles of venture capital, it identifies criteria for such an alternative approach...|$|R
