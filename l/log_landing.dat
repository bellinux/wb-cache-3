However, typical logging operations in the southeastern United States delimb and top at the landing, so logging residues are concentrated at the landing. In a current study by researchers at Auburn University and the Southern Research Station, the bundler unit was mounted on a motorized trailer for stationary use on a <b>log</b> <b>landing.</b> Worksite management analysis is needed to investigate equipment placement and work coordination needed when adding the trailer-mounted John Deere B- 380 Slash Bundler to a <b>log</b> <b>landing.</b> In field trials to be installed during the fall of 2009, researchers will analyze the working area needed for the machine, determine optimal equipment placement, and identify coordination with existing landing functions.

40|$|Former {{studies have}} shown that once compacted, forest soils often recover slowly (many decades) to pre-disturbed levels for soil {{properties}} such as bulk density or penetrometer resistance. Runoff and soil erosion from forest lands increases due to effects from this soil compaction. Increased carbon sequestration is expected from forest land; however, increased runoff and erosion will negatively affect carbon sequestration in the soil. As climate change occurs, more intense rain may fall which will create challenges with runoff and erosion from compacted sites. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of selected harvesting techniques on soil physical and hydraulic properties. The effects of logging roads, <b>log</b> <b>landing</b> areas, and logged areas on water retention, saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSat), and bulk density were investigated on harvested sites within the Mark Twain National Forest in Callaway County, Missouri, USA on a moderately well-drained Keswick soil (fine, smectitic, mesic Aquertic Chromic Hapludalfs). Soil cores (7. 6 cm by 7. 6 cm) were removed in four 10 -cm depth increments in June and were evaluated for saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil water retention, pore-size distributions, and bulk density. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured for each core sample using a constant head permeameter, or the falling head method for samples with low values. For the water retention measurements, soil cores were saturated and water retention measurements were recorded for 0. 0, - 0. 4, - 1. 0, - 2. 5, - 5. 0, - 10. 0 and - 20. 0 kPa readings. Soil aggregate samples were used for the - 33 and - 100 kPa water retention readings and samples passed through a 2. 0 mm sieve was used for the - 1, 500 kPa water retention reading. The soil bulk density was also determined for the soil core samples. Pore size distributions were estimated using the water retention data from each sample. Bulk density was significantly higher (P< 0. 01) for the logging road and <b>log</b> <b>landing</b> areas compared to the logged areas. This was att...|$|E

40|$|Foresters in West Virginia follow BMP {{guidelines}} by reseeding retired log landings with inexpensive grasses {{that quickly}} provide erosion control. However, these grasses typically are not native {{nor do they}} provide high quality forage for wildlife. I developed 3 native seed mixtures for <b>log</b> <b>landing</b> reclamation that would maintain sediment control, as well as enhance wildlife habitat. These mixtures included an erosion control mixture, a wildlife mixture, and a wildflower mixture. I assessed sediment control, biomass production, vegetation structure, forage quality, and small mammal usage of my native mixtures and a commonly used, non-native traditional mixture in 2005 and 2006. No statistical analysis of sediments was conducted among mixtures due to small sample size (n = 6). There were no differences among mixtures in biomass production. The wildlife mixture was highest in crude protein, height and % cover among native seed mixtures. Small mammal relative abundance and species richness did not differ among mixtures. I used compromise programming analysis {{to find the best}} seed mixture for reclaiming log landings based on land management objectives. Objectives used for analysis included those of a private landowner interested in hunting, a private landowner interested in aesthetics, a timber company, and a wildlife manager.

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the detection of logging infrastructure using Landsat images and LiDAR data and verify how long logging scars can be identified through remote sensing. The study was carried out in an annual production unite at the Antimary State Forestry Acre State, western Amazon. We used Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation (NPV) images to identify log landings and compare its location with relative vegetation density models generated from LiDAR data. We also compared the <b>log</b> <b>landing</b> areas identified in the images with the location of 40 log landings obtained in the field through DGPS. The mean area of the detected by landsat images landings was 435 m 2 while the undetected landings was 302 m 2. The technique tested in this study allowed us to detect 30 % of the log landings in NPV images and assisted in the visual interpretation of the canopy opened produced by selective logging. The relative vegetation density model tested in this study successfully identified altered by forest operations area two years after logging, while using Landsat images these areas could be detected only in the logging year. 201...|$|E
40|$|Manual {{time and}} motion studies {{are the most}} common method to collect forest {{harvesting}} machine performance data. However, manual methods require skilled observers and are generally limited in duration, making it difficult to obtain a sufficiently large sample for machines with long cycle times such as skidders and forwarders. Of the automated data capture techniques studied previously, few have the breadth and ease of application to conduct long term autonomous studies for a range of harvesting machines. Analysis of Global Positioning System (GPS) data has been successfully trialled previously to conduct time studies of comparable accuracy with skilled observers, however, these approaches have been limited by the need for a degree of manual data processing. The current study trialled a fully automated system using analysis of GPS and vibration sensor data to estimate cycle times and time elements, and compare them with those determined using traditional time and motion studies for three forwarders at different sites. The mean difference between the cycle times estimated by the two methods was < 1 second. This demonstrated the automated system’s ability to accurately determine each <b>log</b> <b>landing</b> location and extent and each work cycle start and end points. The correspondence between time elements using each approach was poorer. This was mainly caused by mislabelling of brief periods by the automated system as loading events when the forwarder slowed to negotiate steep areas at one study site. These errors may be able to be addressed by adding further rules to the automated system...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} a computer simulation program for the operation of a <b>log</b> <b>landing</b> for the proposed Heli- stat airship. The first part of the paper describes the time study used to develop production rates for the chasers, buckers, front-end loaders, and skidders to be used on the landing. A time study was performed on a helicopter landing resulting in regression equations or production probability distributions for each of the five job functions on the landing. Because the Heli-stat is capable of delivering a much larger payload than the helicopter that was studied, extrapolations of the time study results were necessary. A mechanical analysis was used to determine the production rate of a large rubber tired skidder used as a swing machine between the dropsite and the bucking chute. The second part of the paper {{discusses the}} features of General Purpose Simulation System (GPSS V) program used to simulate the Helistat landing. Queue lengths and equipment utilization rates were used as evaluation criteria in determining the minimum turn times that could be handled by a number of different landing configurations. Different crewing patterns were evaluated for landings with one or two dropsites for old-growth log loads consisting of either bucked logs, tree length logs, or whole trees with tops and limbs. Production rates and production costs based on delay free times were used to compare the various alternatives. The results indicate that tree length logging may have some definite advantages over the other two types because the long,limbed logs can be handled more efficiently than either the bucked logs or the whole trees. The results also show that a standard helicopter landing configuration increased in both physical dimensions and crew sizes can accommodate Heli-stat turn times of 4. 0 to 6. 0 minutes. A primary goal of this project was to develop production equations {{that could be used in}} a larger stump-to-cold-deck simulation of the entire Hell-stat yarding cycle. This larger simulation will be performed by the Aerospace Corporation of Los Angeles, California, and will incorporate the landing production rates developed here with yarding and load assembly production rates developed by John Miles and Bruce Hartsough at the University of California at Davis...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, shihuahuaco timber – {{comprising}} {{several species of}} Dipteryx (Fabaceae) traded internationally as “cumarú” or “Brazilian teak” – {{has become one of}} the most highly demanded types of hardwood from Peruvian Amazonia, particularly in the Chinese market. Dipteryx is an ecologically important canopy-emergent genus with widespread distribution in neotropical forests. To assess the response of Dipteryx to logging, we conducted inventories in three logging areas in the Regions of Ucayali and Loreto, Peru. The size-class distributions of Dipteryx populations in recently logged sites showed that initial post-logging conditions enhance recruitment of residual seedlings. These conditions are created by a combination of logging gaps and the activities of farmers migrating into <b>logged</b> <b>lands.</b> Through protection and liberation of shihuahuaco seedlings in post-logged forest as well as within and around agricultural fields, local residents and timber companies could favor the recovery of this valued resource.
