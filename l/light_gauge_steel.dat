50|$|Cinderella Castle is {{designed}} to reflect the late-Gothic, flamboyant style of the 1400s. Unlike Disneyland's castle, no gold is used on the exterior; all gold colors are anodized aluminum. Despite appearances, no bricks were used in its construction; the inner structure is constructed of six hundred tons of steelbraced frame construction, and a 10 in reinforced concrete wall encircles the structure to the full height of the outermost stone-like walls. All of the steel and concrete works are supported on a concrete drilled caisson foundation. Much less fiberglass is used than is popularly supposed. Rather, most of the exterior is a thick, very hard fiber-reinforced gypsum plaster that is supported by light-gauge metal studs. Most fiberglass work is reserved for the exterior walls of more ornate upper towers. The roofs are not fiberglass, either. They are shingled in {{the same type of}} plastic that computer monitor shells are made from, attached to a cone of <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> sheeting over the steel sub-frame.

40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> {{frame wall}} systems are {{commonly}} used in industrial and commercial buildings, {{and there is a}} need for simple fire design rules to predict their load capacities and fire resistance ratings. During fire events, the <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> frame wall studs are subjected to non-uniform temperature distributions that cause thermal bowing, neutral axis shift and magnification effects and thus resulting in a combined axial compression and bending action on the studs. In this research, a series of full-scale fire tests was conducted first to evaluate the performance of <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> frame wall systems with eight different wall configurations under standard fire conditions. Finite element models of <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> frame walls were then developed, analysed under transient and steady-state conditions and validated using full-scale fire tests. Using the results from fire tests and finite element analyses, a detailed investigation was undertaken into the prediction of axial compression strength and failure times of <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> frame wall studs in standard fires using the available fire design rules based on Australian, American and European standards. The results from both fire tests and finite element analyses were used to investigate the ability of these fire design rules to include the complex effects of non-uniform temperature distributions and their accuracy in predicting the axial compression strength of wall studs and the failure times.

40|$|AbstractThe axial {{compressive}} strength capacity of concrete-filled <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> composite columns was assessed through an experimental program involving twelve long and fourteen stub columns with width-to-thickness ratio of 125 for the encasing steel section. A comparison between concrete-only and confined stub columns {{demonstrated that the}} stub column experiences an increase of strength of up to 16 % due to confinement. The {{compressive strength}} contribution of the <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>steel</b> section was limited by local buckling. Specifically, the steel-only stub column sections lacking the concrete core experienced, on average, approximately 33 % of its full compressive strength. The full-scale composite columns illustrated that the axial compressive strength capacity was controlled by end bearing capacity and local buckling of the <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>steel.</b> The axial compression strength capacity of the full-scale composite columns was satisfactorily predicted based on end bearing resistance of the concrete core and local strains in the <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>steel.</b> Furthermore, the 33 % strength contribution established from the steel-only sections provided a satisfactory lower bound estimate for the calculation of axial compressive strength...|$|E
40|$|In recent times, <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> cold-formed <b>steel</b> {{sections}} {{have been}} used extensively in residential, industrial and commercial buildings as primary load bearing structural components. This is because cold-formed steel sections {{have a very high}} strength to weight ratio compared with thicker hot-rolled steel sections, and their manufacturing process is simple and cost-effective. However, these members are susceptible to various buckling modes including local and distortional buckling and their ultimate strength behaviour is governed by these buckling modes. Fire safety design of building structures has received greater attention in recent times due to continuing loss of properties and lives during fires. Hence, {{there is a need to}} fully evaluate the performance of <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> cold-formed <b>steel</b> structures under fire conditions. Past fire research has focused heavily on heavier, hot-rolled steel members. The buckling behaviour of <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> cold-formed <b>steel</b> members under fire conditions is not well understood. The buckling effects associated with thin steels are significant and have to be taken into account in fire safety design. Therefore, a research project based on extensive experimental and numerical studies was undertaken at the Queensland University of Technology to investigate the distortional buckling behaviour of <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> cold-formed <b>steel</b> compression members under simulated fire conditions. As the first phase of this research program more than 115 tensile coupon tests of <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> cold-formed <b>steels</b> including two steel grades and five thicknesses were conducted at elevated temperatures. Accurate mechanical properties including the yield strength, elasticity modulus and stress-strain curves were all determined at elevated temperatures since the deterioration of the mechanical properties is one of the major parameters in the structural design under fire conditions. An appropriate stress-strain model was also developed by considering the inelastic characteristics. The results obtained from the tensile coupon tests were then used to predict the ultimate strength of cold-formed steel compression members. In the second phase of this research more than 170 laboratory experiments were undertaken to investigate the distortional buckling behaviour of <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> coldformed <b>steel</b> compression members at ambient and elevated temperatures. Two types of cross sections were selected with various thicknesses (nominal thicknesses are 0. 6, 0. 8, and 0. 95 mm) and both low and high strength steels (G 250 and G 550 steels with minimum yield strengths of 250 and 550 MPa). The experiments were conducted at six different temperatures in the range of 20 to 800 °C. A finite element model of the tested compression members was then developed and validated with the help of experimental results. The degradation of mechanical properties with increasing temperatures was included in finite element analyses. An extensive series of parametric analyses was undertaken using the validated finite element model to investigate the effect of all the influential parameters such as section geometry, steel thickness and grade, mechanical properties and temperature. The resulting large data base of ultimate loads of compression members subject to distortional buckling was then used to review the adequacy of the current design rules at ambient temperature. The current design rules were reasonably accurate in general, but in order to improve the accuracy further, this research has developed new design equations to determine the ultimate loads of compression members at ambient temperature. The developed equation was then simply modified by including the relevant mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. It was found that this simple modification based on reduced mechanical properties gave reasonable results, but not at higher temperatures. Therefore, they were further modified to obtain a more accurate design equation at elevated temperatures. The accuracy of new design rules was then verified by comparing their predictions with the results obtained from the parametric study. This thesis presents a description of the experimental and numerical studies undertaken in this research and the results including comparison with simply modified current design rules. It describes the laboratory experiments at ambient and elevated temperatures. It also describes the finite element models of cold-formed steel compression members developed in this research that included the appropriate mechanical properties, initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses. Finally, it presents the details of the new design equations proposed for the <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> coldformed <b>steel</b> compression members subjected to distortional buckling effects at elevated temperatures...|$|R
