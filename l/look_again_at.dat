[...] "Although he is often considered a champion of democracy and equality, Whitman constructs a hierarchy with himself at the head, America below, {{and the rest of the}} world in a subordinate position." [...] In his study, [...] "The Pragmatic Whitman: Reimagining American Democracy", Stephen John Mack suggests that critics, who tend to ignore it, should <b>look</b> <b>again</b> <b>at</b> Whitman’s nationalism: “Whitman’s seemingly mawkish celebrations of the United States … [...] one of those problematic features of his works that teachers and critics read past or explain away” (xv-xvi). Nathanael O’Reilly in an essay on [...] "Walt Whitman’s Nationalism in the First Edition of Leaves of Grass" [...] claims that [...] "Whitman’s imagined America is arrogant, expansionist, hierarchical, racist and exclusive; such an America is unacceptable to Native Americans, African-Americans, immigrants, the disabled, the infertile, and all those who value equal rights." [...] Whitman's imaginative [...] "mawkish" [...] nationalism avoided issues concerning the genocide of Native Americans. As George Hutchinson and David Drews further suggest in an essay [...] "Racial attitudes","Clearly, Whitman could not consistently reconcile the ingrained, even foundational, racist character of the United States with its egalitarian ideals.

2500|$|On Wednesday 24 March 2012, 14 year-old Noah Crooks {{was accused}} of {{shooting}} his 32-year-old mother with a [...]22 caliber rifle after a failed attempt to rape her.

In March 2013, Brian Docherty, a chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, commented that [...] "These games are rated 18 and shouldn't be played by children of this young age" [...] and that [...] "We need to <b>look</b> <b>again</b> <b>at</b> {{what we can do to}} [...]" [...] Similar and other effects were denounced in 2004 by Gary Webb in his article The Killing Game, exposing the use of increased reality video games by the US Army.|$|E
