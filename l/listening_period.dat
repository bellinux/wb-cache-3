This study investigates the impact of subsampling on the accuracy of two common metrics, acoustic presence and call rate, for different vocalization patterns (regimes) of baleen whales: (1) variable vocal activity, (2) vocalizations organized in song bouts, and (3) vocal activity with diel patterns. To this end, above metrics are compared for continuous and subsampled data subject to different sampling strategies, covering duty cycles between 50 % and 2 %. The results show that a reduction of the duty cycle impacts negatively on the accuracy of both acoustic presence and call rate estimates. For a given duty cycle, frequent short <b>listening</b> <b>periods</b> improve accuracy of daily acoustic presence estimates over few long <b>listening</b> <b>periods.</b> Overall, subsampling effects are most pronounced for low and/or temporally clustered vocal activity.

30|$|Like counter-based protocols, distance-based {{broadcast}} protocols[11] use {{the notion}} of expected additional coverage to determine {{the value of a}} node’s retransmission. Instead of counting neighbour retransmissions, they look at the signal strength of these retransmissions to estimate additional coverage. They assume that signal strength (captured from the Received Signal Strength Indicator - RSSI) is an indication of a transmitter’s distance to the receiving node. The greater the distance (i.e. the lower the first message’s RSSI), the more additional nodes the receiving node can cover with its retransmission. To exploit this notion, distance-based protocols wait for a random but bounded time after the first message reception listening to further retransmissions. If the maximum signal strength of all received retransmissions falls below a certain threshold, the node is allowed to retransmit. Both counter-based and distance-based broadcast protocols use random <b>listening</b> <b>periods</b> which can be counter-productive: nodes of higher topological importance may be preempted from retransmitting if the listening timer of less ‘important’ nodes in their vicinity expires first.|$|R

However, the channel may still be busy and when it is, a transmitter with higher priority traffic will randomize a shorter backoff time than transmitters with lower priority traffic. This type of prioritization mechanism where the delay before channel access together with the backoff time is manipulated according to packet priorities is also found in the standard IEEE 802.11 e which is included in IEEE 802.11 p. In [5], there is also an additional feature where a potential transmitter sends a busy tone using a reserved frequency to get the attention from the intended recipient, which then polls the busy tone sender. However, busy tones and prioritizing packets do not eliminate the problem and there is still no upper bound on when channel access can take place.|$|E

The IEEE 802. 11 protocol specifies a simple power save mechanism (PSM) to conserve energy. However, the protocol needlessly wastes energy when traffic is light in a network, and significantly increases packet latency. In this paper, we consider three techniques to improve the 802. 11 PSM protocol. The first technique, Carrier Sense ATIM, uses carrier sensing to drastically reduce the energy wasted listening to the channel in 802. 11 PSM.

30|$|Conversely, {{a number}} of studies are {{currently}} considering not only energy savings but also the QoS issues as well [13 – 17]. In [13], the authors proposed an energy-saving centric scheme for downlink scheduling. The authors presented a longest virtual burst first (LVBF) scheduling algorithm to improve the energy efficiency of MSs and meet the requirement of minimal data rates for the connection with PSC I [14]. A minimum wakeup time (MWT) scheduling scheme for PSC II was proposed in [15] to determine the maximal sleeping time for a single MS with constant bit rate (CBR) traffic and analyzed the upper bound for multiple MS power-saving scheduling with a MWT. Tsao and Chen [16] proposed two power-saving scheduling algorithms. The first algorithm is a periodic on-off scheme based on the idea of allowing an MS to sleep for a fixed interval and, subsequently, to listen for another fixed interval in a round-robin manner to determine feasible solutions for minimal energy consumption under the delay constraint. The aperiodic on-off scheme was proposed to solve the energy-wasting problem of no traffic transmission during a fixed <b>listen</b> <b>period,</b> which adjusts the length of sleep and <b>listen</b> <b>periods</b> according to the traffic status. The energy-efficient architecture for two-level scheduling was proposed in [17]. The proposed architecture sets a priority order for the first-level scheduling by assuming that a mobile and fixed station coexist in the network and that mobile stations have a higher priority than fixed stations from an energy-saving viewpoint. Their study proposed a two-timer mechanism (i.e., empty timer and overloading timer) to dynamically adjust the state transition timing to achieve optimal energy efficiency. Most previous studies considered either sleeping period management for one type of connection or sleep synchronization of multiple connections, but resource scheduling for uplink traffic from an energy saving viewpoint was seldom considered. However, a BS must serve various types of connections for multiple MSs in a practical environment. Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} is to schedule sleeping and resources in a tradeoff manner so that an MS can conserve as much energy as possible and sufficiently provision its desired QoS.|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{there is}} a growing body of {{literature}} to support the importance of understanding self processes in the experience of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), no experimental research has directly examined the relationship between self-construals and phenomena central to OCD. The current study examined the effect that unwanted intrusions and neutralizing responses have on self-worth, distress and urge to neutralize. Methods: After listening to repeated audio recordings of idiosyncratic unwanted intrusions, a combined nonclinical and clinical OCD sample were asked to respond with either their chosen neutralizing strategy (experimental) or a refocus counting strategy (control). Each condition comprised of a 12 -min responding period (respond) followed by an equivalent non-response <b>period</b> (<b>listen).</b> Participants completed each condition, and were randomly allocated into the condition completed first. Ratings of discomfort, urge to neutralize, and self-worth were measured throughout. Results: Neutralizing and refocussing responses were both associated with decreases in discomfort and higher self-worth. The expected rebound effect for discomfort and urge to neutralize for the <b>listen</b> <b>period</b> after neutralizing was found. Limitations: Methodological problems lead to missing data, although this was corrected with the use of Multi Level Modelling (MLM) analysis on a combined sample. The small clinical sample meant that comparison between the two populations was not possible. Conclusions: Findings support cognitive accounts that neutralizing is involved in the development and maintenance of OCD, and suggest that neutralizing is a purposeful response aimed to help reinstate selfworth.

40|$|Abstract—Reduced energy {{consumption}} {{is a crucial}} aspect of mobile Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) networks, which {{are expected to be}} populated by battery-operated devices, like mobile phones and palmtops. For this reason the IEEE 802. 16 e, {{which is one of the}} front-runner competitors in this field, specifies a set of power saving mechanisms to be employed by the Base Station (BS) and Mobile Stations (MSs) to reduce the amount of time the latter spend with the wireless interface on. These mechanisms are classified into three class types, which are designed for different types of applications. In this paper we focus on class type I, which fits the typical requirements of best-effort traffic. With class type I, an MS with power saving enabled alternates between sleep and listening periods. The duration of the sleep periods increases by a factor 2 each time a <b>listening</b> <b>period</b> ends, up to a maximum sleep window size. Since the standard does not provide guidelines for setting the above parameters, which are negotiated between the BS and MSs when setting up a power saving class, we evaluate via simulation their impact on the performance, in terms of both application-specific metric, i. e. delay or throughput depending on the type of traffic, and the amount of energy saved.

40|$|Abstract- The optimal {{consumption}} of energy {{is one of}} the most important aims in Wireless sensor networks. Among influential factors in reducing the energy consumption ratio, we can mention intelligent allocation of channel to node and sending the data with the least rate of interference with other nodes. The successful execution of this act by MAC sub-layer depends on determining optimal values for factors such as percentage of duty cycle, random time to retest the channel an etc. Duty cycle, defined as the ratio of <b>listening</b> <b>period</b> to total period of listening and sleeping, is of great importance as the parameter of regulating node sleeping and listening time for ideal {{consumption of}} energy. There is presented an algorithm based on learning automat, called LA-MAC, which tries to reduce energy consumption by regulating optimally the duty cycle value, thereby increasing the lifetime of network. In this algorithm, each node is equipped with a learning automat which determines the value of duty cycle in terms of residual energy and preconfigured lifetime. The results of simulation in the environment of NS simulator confirm the efficiency of LA MAC from four factors of the death time of the first node, endto-end delay, average network lifetime and the number of survived nodes at the end of simulation, performed in two different scenarios while compared with A-MAC and S-MAC with various duty cycles...|$|E
40|$|The {{past two}} decades have seen {{increasing}} interests {{in the field of}} wireless sensor networks(WSNs), which have potential applications covering all aspects of the human life. The majorissue in WSNs is power conservation since wireless sensors are usually battery-powered. In a typical sensor node, the wireless interface consumes the largest share of the powerbudget. Hence, an energy efficient medium access control (MAC) protocol is vital. The MACprotocol always adopts the duty cycling mechanism to reduce idle listening, which is the mostsignificant energy wastage. The mechanism, however, has negative effects on latency andthroughput performance. Meanwhile, an increasing number of prospective applications notonly imposes requirements on energy efficiency but also on other Quality of Services (QoS) parameters. Therefore, it is great of importance to design new efficient MAC protocols,which meet the energy efficiency and QoS requirements. We first focus on designing energy efficient, low latency MAC protocols for low data rateWSNs. The traditional approach is letting a duty cycling MAC protocol forward packetsvia multiple hops in a cycle, i. e., the multi-hop MAC. However, the original multi-hop MACprotocol incurs a large control overhead, and a so-called long <b>listening</b> <b>period</b> problem. Wepropose a low latency, low control overhead MAC protocol (the LO-MAC), which overcomesthe mentioned disadvantages by exploiting the physical properties of wireless channel. LO-MAC introduces a new traffic adaptive scheme based on carrier sensing characteristics. Thescheme effectively controls the length of <b>listening</b> <b>period</b> following the traffic load. Moreover,LO-MAC takes full advantages of the broadcast nature and lets a packet containing diffierentmeanings during its transmission. Therefore, the number of transmitting packets and thecontrol overhead is significantly reduced. Secondly, we introduce an approach in designing efficient MAC protocols for dynamic loadenvironments. We propose MAC 2 protocol, a novel Multi-hop Adaptive MAC protocol withpacket Concatenation. MAC 2 achieves a better performance than a state-of-the-art protocolin terms of energy efficiency, low latency and high throughput. The proposed protocolcontrols the adaptation to the traffic load by combining a signalling traffic adaptive schemeand a demand wakeup manner. The scheme and the manner are based on a synchronizationprocess and a proportional mapping function, respectively. Besides that, the protocol has aconcatenation scheme, which concatenates several queued packets into a bigger one beforesending out of a node. The concatenation scheme reduces not only the control overhead butalso the average latency. Additionally, MAC 2 is numerically optimized to achieve minimumlatency and guarantee no data transmission collision. Finally, we also target the dynamic load environments, but take an asynchronous approachof the efficient MAC design. We propose an Asynchronous MAC protocol with QoS awareness(the AQ-MAC), which is energy efficient and provides different QoS levels to relevant typesof traffic. AQ-MAC achieves energy efficiency and collision avoidance by utilizing a receiver-initiated transmission and the concatenation scheme derived from MAC 2. Moreover, AQ-MAC adopts the diffierentiate service (DiffServ) model to provide QoS. Data packets areprovided diffierent transmission strategies depending on their levels of importance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Wireless access {{networks}} scale by replicating base stations geographically and then allowing mobile clients to seamlessly “hand off ” from one station {{to the next}} as they traverse the network. However, providing the illusion of continuous connectivity requires selecting {{the right moment to}} handoff and the right base station to transfer to. Unfortunately, 802. 11 -based networks only attempt a handoff when a client’s service degrades to a point where connectivity is threatened. Worse, the overhead of scanning for nearby base stations is routinely over 250 ms – during which incoming packets are dropped – far longer than what can be tolerated by highly interactive applications such as voice telephony. In this paper we describe SyncScan, a low-cost technique for continuously tracking nearby base stations by synchronizing short <b>listening</b> <b>periods</b> at the client with periodic transmissions from each base station. We have implemented this SyncScan algorithm using commodity 802. 11 hardware and we demonstrate that it allows better handoff decisions and over an order of magnitude improvement in handoff delay.

Trickle uses a “polite gossip ” policy, where nodes periodically broad-cast a code summary {{to local}} neighbors but stay quiet {{if they have}} recently heard a summary identical to theirs. When a node hears an older summary than its own, it broadcasts an update. Instead of flooding a network with packets, the al-gorithm controls the send rate so each node hears a small trickle of packets, just enough to stay up to date. We first analyze Trickle using an idealized single-cell net-work model, with perfect synchronization and no packet loss. Progressively relaxing these assumptions, we evaluate the al-gorithm in simulation, first without synchronization, then {{in the presence of}} loss, and finally in the multi-cell case.

This helped us to meet the QoS requirement for vital sign monitoring. As per our survey, the most related MAC protocols to our design are PRIMA [16] and QMAC [17]. Similarities in our design and these include the use of RTS/CTS for channel contention, use of different queues to reflect different levels of latency requirement. Unlike PRIMA, which uses TDMA/CSMA, the proposed MAC used a combination of OFDMA and CSMA in channel access. Nodes in different frequency segments can communicate to the next hop neighbor independently. As routing protocol design is not the aim of the paper, we used a simple RSSI-based forward routing to route data to the sink node via multi-hop. Note that we can extend to using a more complex routing mechanism using clustering and cluster heads as proposed in LEACH [18] and its subsequent improvements in [16, 19]. The proposed design allows those nodes that have no data to go into the sleep state, thus minimizing the idle <b>listening</b> <b>periods</b> that consume significant energy in sensor networks. In this sense, the energy consumption due to sleep cycle and idle listening in our system is the same as PRIMA.|$|R

Two types of priority customers are defined, customers with priority 1 (P 1) go directly to an ordinary FIFO queue. However, if customers with priority 2 (P 2) find the server in busy or unavailable state go to the orbit. These customers stay in the orbit and retry their request until find the server in idle and available state. We assume that P 1 customers have non-preemptive priority over P 2 customers. The server starts with a <b>listening</b> <b>period</b> and if no customer arrive during this period it will enter in the vacation mode.

If that period expires without arrivals the node will enter in the next sleeping period.

A new and simple algorithm for the generation of quaternary series from known binary complementary sequences is given and the concept of correlation matrices is introduced to complementary series, permitting signal design in the detection window. The encoded Vibroseis input signals were tested on a computer and showed perfect sidelobe suppression a certain distance away from the main compressed pulse, when detected by a matched filter. Field tests with the coded signals were conducted, taking advantage of a computerized Vibroseis field system. The tests showed promising results.

The PRIMA protocol {{consists of two}} phases; a clustering phase and a channel access phase. Clustering the sensor network makes the MAC protocol to handle well network scalability issues. The channel access is composed of a hybrid mode of TDMA and CSMA. CSMA mode is used to communicate control messages, while data messages are assigned TDMA slots. Doing so, minimizes packet collisions and consequently minimizing energy consumption.

The PRIMA protocol provides Quality of Service (QoS) by employing a queueing model to classify the traffic depending on its importance into four different queues.

3000|$|The {{original}} IEEE 802.11, {{intended for}} wireless local area networking (WLAN), has two well-known drawbacks within its {{medium access control}} (MAC) technique {{carrier sense multiple access}} (CSMA): it can cause unbounded delays before channel access as well as collisions on the channel. The MAC protocol decides who has the right to transmit next on the shared communication channel. In a carrier sense system, such as CSMA, the node first listens to the channel and if the channel has been free for a certain time period, the node transmits directly with the implication that another node can have conducted the exact same procedure, resulting in a collision on the channel. Moreover, a node can experience very long channel access delays due to the risk of the channel being busy during its <b>listening</b> <b>period.</b> These two phenomena occur primarily during high utilization periods in the network. CSMA is used by the whole IEEE 802.11 family as well as its wired counterpart IEEE 802.3 Ethernet. One {{of the reasons for the}} success of both WLAN and Ethernet is the straightforward implementation of the standard resulting in reasonably priced equipment. Due to this WLANs and Ethernet are often applied to other domains than they originally were designed for. Even though CSMA is unsuitable for real-time communication because of the unbounded channel access delays, Ethernet has paved its way into the industrial communication scene where many real-time systems are found. However, the problems with the MAC method can be solved here by introducing more network equipment, such as switches and routers, and thereby reducing the number of nodes competing for the shared channels, that is, breaking up collision domains. In the wireless domain, however, there is no such easy solution since the wireless channel has to be shared by all users. Further, when the CSMA algorithm is applied in the wireless domain, an interferer could easily jam a geographical area, intentionally or unintentionally, and the nodes in this area would defer their access even though there is no [...] "real" [...] data traffic present. A wireless carrier sense system is thus more susceptible to interference since no access will occur as long as activity is detected on the channel.|$|E
30|$|Duty cycling: This is one {{mechanism}} {{widely used}} for energy-efficient MAC protocols in WSN. A MAC protocol that implements duty cycling uses appropriate sleep/wake-up mechanisms to conserve energy, and in [22], it is demonstrated that when sensor nodes {{remain in the}} sleep mode, they consume less energy than when in the idle mode. When {{there is no need}} for communication, the radio is put to sleep and, although applying duty cycling energy is conserved, it has some disadvantages. Putting sensors into sleep mode makes it difficult to the all network to function or at least certain part of it. As showed in [23], a few issues are needed to overcome such as deciding when to switch a device to low power mode or deciding “for how long should a device remain in the low power mode?” To solve these issues, efficient and flexible duty cycling techniques have been proposed. The S-MAC [24] and the T-MAC [25] protocols are examples of them. These protocols transmit a SYNC packet to notify neighbors about their schedule and to synchronize the clocks of all nodes in the network. The method only compensates for clock offset and does not consider clock drift [21]. Moreover, the knowledgement of traffic patterns can also help to take decisions about waking up. This method is known as adaptive duty cycling. S-MAC [24] is one of the major energy-efficient MAC protocols that efficiently exploits the idea of adaptive duty cycling. It uses a periodic sleep-wake-up mechanism in order to lower power consumption. If a node has no packet to receive, it can waste a large amount of energy by just listening to the channel. Consequently, a node can save a significant amount of energy if it simply goes to sleep mode by switching off its radios [22]. T-MAC is an improvement over S-MAC duty cycling. In the T-MAC, <b>listening</b> <b>period</b> ends when no event has occurred for a time threshold TA. Though it improves on S-MAC, T-MAC has the disadvantage that it can face an early sleeping problem where a node can go to sleep even though its neighbor may still have messages for it. Synchronization is also an issue in duty cycling MAC protocols. In [26], that synchronous MACs such as S-MAC have low energy consumption for sending packets but are complicated due to the need of synchronization is argued. Conversely, asynchronous MACs, for example WiseMAC [27], is very simple, but it spends much energy in finding the neighbor’s wake-up time. Moreover, synchronous methods can be characterized as one-way methods. Usually, the senders broadcast a reference message and receivers, upon the reception of the message, record the arrival time by their own clocks, and exchange this information among each other to compensate clock offset between them. In [21], a synchronous method is proposed in which clocks in the all network are not modified. Instead, the nodes are synchronized with their own clocks. Since the periodic broadcast event in the network is the same, although they have different measurement results for this period by their own clock unit independently, they are able to interact with each other at the same physical time. Without complicating the estimation process and without modifying the clock of a node, this synchronization method becomes simpler and more energy-efficient than the traditional synchronization one-way method.|$|E

Our analysis confirms a number of properties previously highlighted by research based on interviews and questionnaires, but also uncover new statistical patterns, both at the individual and collective levels. In particular, we show that individuals follow common listening rhythms characterized by the same fluctuations, alternating heavy and light <b>listening</b> <b>periods,</b> and can be classified in four groups of similar sizes according to their temporal habits [...] - 'early birds', 'working hours listeners', 'evening listeners' and 'night owls'. We provide a detailed radioscopy of the listeners' interplay between repeated listening and discovery of new content. We show that different genres encourage different listening habits, from Classical or Jazz music with a more balanced listening among different songs, to Hip Hop and Dance with a more heterogeneous distribution of plays. Finally, we provide measures of how distant people are {{from each other in}} terms of common songs. In particular, we show that the number of songs S a DJ should play to a random audience of size N such that everyone hears at least one song he/she currently listens to, is of the form S∼ N^α where the exponent depends on the music genre and is in the range [0. 5, 0. 8]. More generally, our results show that the recent access to virtually infinite catalogs of songs does not promote exploration for novelty, but that most users favor repetition of the same songs.

30|$|As in Simulation Scenario 1, it is {{considered}} a number of RT stations operating in the same frequency band {{with a set of}} ST stations. In Scenario 2, ST stations transmit two types of traffic: voice (VO) and background (BK). The voice traffic is characterized as a two state Markov ON/OFF to represent realistic voice calls [25]. The ITU-T G. 711 recommendation has been selected, with 64 [*]kb/s bit rate, packet size of 160 bytes generated every 20 [*]ms during a talking (ON) period, and no packet generated in a <b>listening</b> (OFF) <b>period.</b> The mean value of ON/OFF period is 1.5 [*]s and 1.35 [*]s, respectively. The transmission rate of background traffic is 1024 [*]kb/s (packet size of 1500 bytes).|$|R
30|$|From {{this set}} of {{simulations}} (Figure 7), it can be observed for the case of MSPs equal to 50 [*]ms that, whatever the external network load, the average packet delay is always kept below than deadline. In the case of MSPs equal to 5 [*]ms, the average packet delay is kept below the deadline only up to 20 RT stations. On the other hand, the average packet delay is almost independent {{of the number of}} external ST stations. The main reason for this behavior is the higher priority traffic of ST not being always active (ON/OFF behavior) and therefore the level of interference with the RT traffic is much smaller. Remember that for this simulation scenario the ST stations do not generate any voice packet during the <b>listening</b> (OFF) <b>period</b> (1.35 [*]s), while in the previous scenario they generate Poisson distributed traffic in the voice AC category.|$|R
