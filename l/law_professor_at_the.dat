5|$|After {{graduating from}} Yale Law School, Clinton {{returned}} to Arkansas {{and became a}} <b>law</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Arkansas. In 1974, {{he ran for the}} House of Representatives.

Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 {{percent of the vote in}} 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52percent to 48percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election, Clinton was elected.|$|E

He added that he had subsequently realised that adopting this viewpoint was rooted in [...] "the culture of violence" [...] by which a victim is blamed for what happened to them. He called on Jamaicans to be tolerant of LGBT individuals, and to focus on [...] "rebuilding this great nation on the principles of inclusivity, love, equality and respect with no distinctions whatsoever".

[...] Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center cites Atticus Finch as the reason he became a lawyer, and Richard Matsch, the federal judge who presided over the Timothy McVeigh trial, counts Atticus as a major judicial influence. One <b>law</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Notre Dame stated that the most influential textbook he taught from was To Kill a Mockingbird, and an article in the Michigan Law Review claims, [...] "No real-life lawyer has done more for the self-image or public perception of the legal profession," [...] before questioning whether [...] "Atticus Finch is a paragon of honor or an especially slick hired gun".|$|E
