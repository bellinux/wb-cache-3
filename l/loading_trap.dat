40|$|Beams {{of neutral}} polar {{molecules}} in a low-field seeking quantum state can be slowed down using a Stark decelerator, and can subsequently be loaded and confined in electrostatic quadrupole traps. The {{efficiency of the}} <b>trap</b> <b>loading</b> process {{is determined by the}} ability to couple the decelerated packet of molecules into the trap without loss of molecules and without heating. We discuss the inherent difficulties to obtain ideal <b>trap</b> <b>loading,</b> and describe and compare different <b>trap</b> <b>loading</b> strategies. A new "split-endcap" quadrupole trap design is presented that enables improved <b>trap</b> <b>loading</b> efficiencies. This is experimentally verified by comparing the trapping of OH radicals using the conventional and the new quadrupole trap designs...|$|R

The technique is based on photo-ionisation of an atomic beam created by pulsed laser ablation of a calcium target, and provides improved temporal control compared to traditional <b>trap</b> <b>loading</b> methods. Ion loading rates as high as 125 ions per second have so far been observed. Also described are observations of <b>trap</b> <b>loading</b> where Rydberg state atoms are photo-ionised by the ion Doppler cooling laser. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
5000|$|According {{to these}} {{specifications}} the Kaiser Frierdrich {{was designed and}} built with three chimneys (smoke stacks) designated as the number 587 build with the following technical characteristics: length 183 m, width 19.4 m, tonnage [...] and a displacement of 20,100 tons. Fitted with two five cylinder reciprocating steam engines (with cylinder diameter of 109.22 cm, 162.56 cm, 233.68 cm, 2 x 236.22 cm), with quadruple expansion, driving twin three-bladed bronze propellers,with a diameter of 6.19 meters, coupled to crankshafts made by Krupp Steel, the best steel in Germany. The engines were designed to develop a maximum nominal 28,000 horse power and {{in conjunction with the}} fact that the pressure in the ten boilers were rated at 15.5 bar, offered, according to the calculations by the Ferdinand Schichau engineers, a significant potential for coal economy. Contrary to common shipbuilding practices of the era, the engineers placed the engines slightly forward, between the second and third boilers. The ship had nine main boilers, each fitted with two coal <b>loading</b> <b>trap</b> doors plus a tenth auxiliary boiler; these were positioned in three watertight compartments each ducted to a smokestack.|$|E

40|$|Atoms can {{be trapped}} at the foci of intense laser beams, which can enable {{the study of}} {{interactions}} and dynamics of ultracold gases. In this thesis, we will describe our new trap designs. A large volume pancake-shaped optical dipole trap is initially used for loading large numbers of atoms from a Magneto-Optical Trap. A BEC {{with a large number}} of 84 Sr atoms has been achieved after evaporation in this trap. To form degenerate gas of 88 Sr we compress the mixture of 88 Sr and 87 Sr from the <b>loading</b> <b>trap</b> into a superimposed dimple trap. This combination improves the reproducibility of the experiment and shortens the time required to create quantum degenerate samples, while we are able to create 88 Sr BEC with high density. In order to generate BEC of 86 Sr, an isotope with large scattering length and extremely high three-body loss rate, we implement an optical sheet trap which has an aspect ratio of 1 : 10. The tight axis in the vertical direction provides strong potential to hold against gravity while the large horizontal dimension brings up the trap volume and keeps down the atomic density...|$|E

This musical innovation represented {{one of the}} first experimental exercises in jazz. At the time, their music was liberating; the barnyard sounds were experiments in altering the tonal qualities of the instruments, and clattering wood blocks broke up the rhythm.

40|$|International audienceLarge {{arrays of}} {{individually}} controlled atoms trapped in optical tweezers {{are a very}} promising platform for quantum engineering applications. However, to date, only disordered arrays have been demonstrated, due to the non-deterministic <b>loading</b> of the <b>traps.</b> Here, we demonstrate the preparation of fully loaded, two-dimensional arrays of up to âˆ¼ 50 microtraps each containing a single atom, and arranged in arbitrary geometries. Starting from initially larger, half-filled matrices of randomly <b>loaded</b> <b>traps,</b> we obtain user-defined target arrays at unit filling. This is achieved with a real-time control system and a moving optical tweezers that performs a sequence of rapid atom moves depending on the initial distribution of the atoms in the arrays. These results open exciting prospects for quantum engineering with neutral atoms in tunable geometries...|$|R

Another reason given for this was that mosquitoes would not breed nor would weeds grow at such a depth. A soil conservation program was launched in the catchment and bed <b>load</b> <b>traps</b> were installed to minimise loss of earth. The traps have been used as a source of sand and gravel for building sites. Drainage blankets were used to prevent the loss of groundwater beneath the lake.|$|R

Only two events have caused sediment accumulation much higher than background levels. They are the storm of May, 1989 when 3792 kg of material was recovered, and September, 1993 when 2605 kg of sediment was removed from the trap. Analysis of hydrological and rainfall data reveals these two events to be "extreme'. Annual bed load sediment yield is shown to be highly variable. The implications of the observations for monitoring programs and sediment yield determination are discussed. -from Authorslink_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} loading by {{laser ablation}} of ^ 88 Sr^+ ions into a mm-scale surface-electrode ion trap. The laser used for ablation is a pulsed, frequency-tripled Nd:YAG with pulse energies of 1 - 10 mJ and durations of 3 - 5 ns. An additional laser {{is not required}} to photoionize the ablated material. The efficiency and lifetime of several candidate materials for the laser ablation target are characterized by measuring the trapped ion fluorescence signal for a number of consecutive loads. Additionally, laser ablation is used to <b>load</b> <b>traps</b> with a trap depth (40 meV) below where electron impact ionization loading is typically successful (â‰³ 500 meV).

40|$|International audienceTo {{what extent}} are aqueous foams prone to clogging? Foam {{permeability}} is measured {{as a function}} of particulate <b>loading</b> (<b>trapped</b> hydrophilic particles) under conditions where the particle to bubble size ratio is allowed to increase when the number of particles per bubble is fixed. In addition to experiments performed on the foam scale, we investigated experimentally and numerically the hydrodynamic resistance of a single foam node loaded with one particle. It is shown that, with respect to solid porous media, aqueous foams clog more efficiently due to two reasons: (i) the deformation of interfaces allows for larger particles to be incorporated within the interstitial network and (ii) the interfacial mobility contributes to lowering of the reduced permeability...|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{has been}} removed from a "natural" bed <b>load</b> <b>trap</b> in a small upland {{drainage}} basin in Hong Kong and from 1989 to 2003 annual yield has been determined. For the 15 -year observation period the median yield was 607 kg with a highest yield of 3897 kg. Five years (1989, 1993, 1994, 1997 and 1999) recorded annual yields of over 2000 kg. Scattergraphs of annual bed load yield against annual maximum 24 and 48 h rainfall reveal a positive association with correlation coefficients of 0. 69 and 0. 67, respectively. Extreme rainfall events, as defined by high return periods, may be associated with annual bed load yields that are well above the median for the 15 years of observation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} growing human {{pressure}} on agricultural {{land in the}} north of the Lao PDR has led to accelerated degradation processes along hillslopes, and higher sediment delivery rates to streams. Fur-thermore, high demand from urban centres is attracting farmers to cultivate vegetables in riparian areas. These land-use changes may have negative affects on stream water quality. The aims of this study were to assess i) the water and sediment trapping efficiency of riparian vegetation in northern Laos, and ii) the potential effect of cultivating riparian land on these efficiencies. In May-October 2006, flows of surface runoff and sediment were monitored across three riparian sites. Sites were arranged into pairs of adja-cent riparian land plots; one plot was covered with riparian vegetation (native grass, banana or bamboo) and one plot cultivated with upland rice, which was used to test the effect of annual cropping and also acted as the control. Plots were equipped with three Gerlach troughs placed at the upper rim of the ripar-ian zone and three troughs at the lower rim to measure event inflow and outflow (runoff volumes and sediment <b>loads).</b> Event <b>trapping</b> efficiency was calculated as the portion of inflowing water and sediment retained in the plot.

Photo-ionization of a calcium beam for <b>loading</b> a Paul <b>trap</b> has first been demonstrated by Kjrgaard et al. The advantages of our method are the use of cheap and easily handled diode-laser systems and the large cross section for field ionization when exciting high-lying Rydberg states.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a method for}} loading surface electrode ion traps by electron impact ionization. The method relies on the property of surface electrode geometries that the trap depth can be increased {{at the cost of}} more micromotion. By introducing a buffer gas, we can counteract the rf heating assocated with the micromotion and benefit from the larger trap depth. After an initial <b>loading</b> of the <b>trap,</b> standard compensation techniques can be used to cancel the stray fields resulting from charged dielectric and allow for the <b>loading</b> of the <b>trap</b> at ultra-high vacuum.

40|$|We propose <b>loading</b> <b>trapped</b> ions into microtraps {{formed by}} an optical lattice. For {{harmonic}} microtraps, the Coulomb coupling of the spatial motions of neighboring ions {{can be used}} to construct a broad class of effective short-range Hamiltonians acting on an internal degree of freedom of the ions. For large anharmonicities, on the other hand, the spatial motion of the ions itself represents a spin- 1 / 2 model with frustrated dipolar XY interactions. We illustrate the latter setup with three systems: the linear chain, the zig-zag ladder, and the triangular lattice. In the frustrated zig-zag ladder with dipolar interactions we find chiral ordering beyond what was predicted previously for a next-nearest-neighbor model. In the frustrated anisotropic triangular lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions we find that the transition from the one-dimensional gapless spin-liquid phase to the two-dimensional spiraling ordered phase passes through a gapped spin-liquid phase, similar to what has been predicted for the same model with Heisenberg interactions. Further, a second gapped spin-liquid phase marks the transition to the two-dimensional Neel-ordered phase. Comment: re-formatted; added discussion of feasibilit...|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports on}} a {{microfluidic}} platform on which single multicellular spheroids from malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), an aggressive tumor with poor prognosis, can be <b>loaded,</b> <b>trapped</b> and tested for chemotherapeutic drug response. A new method to detect the spheroid viability cultured on the microfluidic chip {{as a function of}} the drug concentration is presented. This approach is based on the evaluation of the caspase activity in the supernatant sampled from the chip and tested using a microplate reader. This simple and time-saving method does only require a minimum amount of manipulations and was established for very low numbers of cells. This feature is particularly important in view of personalised medicine applications for which the number of cells obtained from the patients is low. MPM spheroids were continuously perfused for 48 hours with cisplatin, one of the standard chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat MPM. The 50 % growth inhibitory concentration of cisplatin in perfused MPM spheroids was found to be twice as high as in spheroids cultured under static conditions.
