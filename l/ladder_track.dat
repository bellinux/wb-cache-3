25|$|To {{connect the}} tunnel to Penn Station, {{extensive}} track modifications will be required. The profile of several tracks {{will have to}} be lowered so that they can meet the grade of the new tunnel tracks at the new portal within A Yard. The I <b>Ladder</b> <b>track,</b> which runs diagonal to the other tracks to provide connections to the platforms tracks, would be extended to connect to the new tracks from the tunnel, allowing trains to stop on Tracks 1 through 18. Some tracks within A Yard would be reconfigured. While construction takes place in A Yard, the three trains stored in A Yard and D Yard would be stored in other locations due to the unavailability of storage tracks in those yards. The Empire Line tunnel, near Tenth Avenue, will be modified–100 feet of that tunnel beneath Tenth Avenue will be lowered so that they can connect to the lower track profile in A Yard. This work will either be constructed during weekends over a 20-month period, or through a full closure of the Empire Line tunnel for two to three months. All of this work would take 21 months.|$|E

50|$|The track {{consists}} of steel rail resting on concrete supports via rubberised cork absorption pads with galvanised steel tie beams which wrap around the concrete members {{rather than being}} cast into the concrete as with other <b>ladder</b> <b>tracks.</b> The track is modular and precast, rather than being cast in situ. Modular turnouts are also produced. The modular nature and controlled production of the track sections {{has the advantage of}} rapid installation and good quality control. The ballastless and modular nature of the track makes it advantageous for both wet and desert conditions where ballast degradation is problematic, as well as in mines where transportation of the track components is simplified. Since the rail is continuously supported rail stresses are less; a 34 tonne axle load version has been designed and lighter rails can be used compared to sleepered track, additionally maintenance costs of ballast are reduced.|$|R
50|$|In general, <b>ladder</b> <b>track</b> {{produces}} lower {{pressures on}} the road bed: both the maximum pressure and the amplitude of pressure pulses are smaller than transverse sleepered track, which can reduce maintenance costs in ballasted systems. An additional benefit in ballasted <b>ladder</b> <b>track</b> is increased resistance to ballast wash out {{and other forms of}} ballast degradation due the addition longitudinal support and rigidity in ladder track.; the same structural rigidity also adds to buckling resistance.|$|E

50|$|As built, {{the line}} had 43 bridges and around 16 level crossings. Ballast was of stone chips; the rails {{were held in}} place by keys lodged into iron chairs which rested on and were fixed to stone blocks or larch sleepers. On some parts of the line, a <b>ladder</b> <b>track</b> {{arrangement}} of sleepers was used, with longitudinal stone sleepers of 3 ft held in gauge by transverse cast-iron rods. T or bar-shaped malleable iron rails of 35 lb per yard (about 17.4 kgm−1) were initially used, within a few years 42 lb/yd (about 20.8kgm−1) rails were being introduced.|$|E
50|$|Described as {{track with}} {{longitudinal}} bearers with cross ties, <b>ladder</b> <b>track</b> type was common on early British railways (c.1830/40s), including the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway, Dublin and Kingstown Railway, Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway, Great Western Railway (see Baulk road), Ulster Railway, Newcastle and North Shields Railway, Slamannan Railway (part of), Hull and Selby Railway (two thirds of), Manchester and Bolton Railway (including lontudinal stone sleepers), and the London and Greenwich Railway (partly). On the Hull and Selby Railway {{it was used}} in part as it was noted to produce smooth running, and low wheel wear. However the contact between rail and sleeper produced hydraulic pumping in wet conditions, which led to rolling stock becoming dirtied very quickly. The longitudinal track was also found cause issue with wheel slip on inclines, and to be noticeably inferior to transverse sleepered track in terms of traction.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} tracks {{consisted of}} wooden rails on transverse wooden sleepers, which helped maintain the spacing of the rails. Various developments followed, with cast iron plates laid {{on top of}} the wooden rails and later wrought iron plates or wrought iron angle plates (angle iron as L-shaped plate rails). Rails were also individually fixed to rows of stone blocks, without any cross ties to maintain correct separation. This system also led to problems, as the blocks could individually move. The first version of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's [...] broad gauge system used rails laid on longitudinal sleepers whose rail gauge and elevation were pinned down by being tied to piles (conceptually akin to a pile bridge), but this arrangement was expensive and Brunel soon replaced it with what became the classic broad gauge track, in which the piles were forgone and transoms, similar to sleepers, maintained the rail gauge. Today, most rail track uses the standard system of rail and sleepers; <b>ladder</b> <b>track</b> is used in a few applications.|$|E

50|$|Brunel {{also looked}} at novel track forms, and decided to use a {{continuously}} supported rail. Using longitudinal timbers under each rail, he achieved a smoother profile while not requiring such a strong rail section, and he used a shallow bridge rail for the purpose. The wider, flat foot also meant that the chair needed by the bullhead section could be dispensed with. The longitudinal timbers needed to be kept at the proper spacing to retain the gauge correctly, and Brunel achieved this by using timber transoms - transverse spacers - and iron tie-bars. The whole assembly {{was referred to as}} the baulk road - railwaymen usually call their track a road. Initially, Brunel had the track tied down to timber piles to prevent lateral movement and bounce, but he had overlooked the fact that the made ground, on which his track was supported between piles, would settle. The piles remained stable and the ground between them settled so that his track soon had an unpleasant undulation, and he had to have the piles severed, so that the track could settle more or less uniformly. A variant of the baulk road can still be seen today on many older under-bridges where no ballast was provided. The design varies considerably, but in many cases longitudinal timbers are supported directly on the cross-girders, with transoms and tiebars to retain the gauge, but of course with modern rails and base-plates or chairs. The longitudinal sleepers are somewhat similar to modern-day <b>Ladder</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
40|$|Many of Mizoguchi’s films portray {{suffering}} women, but Life of Oharu (1952) may surpass all his {{others in}} the depth of suffering portrayed. The film features a young woman, Oharu, who {{is the daughter of}} an Imperial samurai. After a brief relationship with a lower class man, her family is exiled from the Imperial court. This event starts a series of misfortunes which, through many episodes, push her down the social <b>ladder</b> and <b>track</b> her moral descent. Ultimately, in her old age, she is reduced to a pathetic, elderly beggar. The film’s tone straightforwardly reflects its subject matter: it is quite sad to watch Oharu systematically destroyed and left with no sense of a brighter future. Yet, other films have portrayed similarly tragic events but fail to move their audience. In this paper, I will discuss various theories of how a film’s narrative structure can affect its ability to generate sadness, and analyze how Oharu arranges its narration in a particularly effective manner towards this end...|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was capable}} of using either an over-running or under-running third rail by means of retractable shoes operated by pneumatic cylinders. The shoes were retracted to the vertical position outside of third rail territory: if extended, electrically live shoes would have projected towards the low-level station platforms that were the norm until the 1970s. A few early examples were fitted with a small DC pantograph for use within New York City's Grand Central Terminal, where long gaps exist in the third rail because of the complex trackage that includes numerous single and double slip switches and double <b>track</b> <b>ladders.</b> These pantographs were soon removed. The complex trackage remains, but the overhead power rails are long gone.|$|R
