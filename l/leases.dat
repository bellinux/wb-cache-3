40|$|One of {{the main}} reasons that <b>leasing</b> is a {{financial}} alternative so popular in the world is the one that synthesize its own „philosophy”: It’s not ownership of the assets but their effective use is the one leading to profit. The key aspect is the proper use of capital resources: the investment of money in what generates „business” and brings profit, like publicity, the superior qualification of the staff, stocks, exploring new markets, research, development, instead of blocking them by purchasing fixed assets. This article aims to approach the <b>leasing</b> as a source or as a financing alternative investments, to highlight the benefits given by that to the three parties involved in a <b>lease</b> - the lessee or the user of the <b>lease,</b> the lessee or the <b>leasing</b> company and the good or the assets supplier which are the subject <b>lease.</b> There are also the main modern forms of <b>leasing</b> which are more common in business finance. <b>leasing,</b> investment, lessor, financial <b>leasing,</b> operating <b>leasing,</b> full pay out <b>leasing,</b> cross-border <b>leasing,</b> buy and <b>lease,</b> sale and <b>lease</b> back, cession-bail, <b>leasing</b> adosse, experimental <b>leasing,</b> time-sharing <b>leasing,</b> renting, credit-bail d’actions, master <b>leasing,</b> wet-lease, leveraged <b>lease.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In my {{dissertation}} I {{am concerned}} {{with the issue of}} <b>leasing</b> in commercial relationships. <b>Leasing</b> is a legal concept that was taken over from abroad after 1989. A close connection with <b>lease</b> and relatively short legal history are probably the reasons behind the certain degree of heterogeneity of opinions on <b>leasing.</b> And the diverse opinions on <b>leasing</b> were the main reason for my choice of this topic. I was particularly interested in delimitation of <b>leasing</b> in relation to <b>lease</b> and in legal regulation of <b>leasing.</b> At the same time I assumed that despite the difference of opinions the practice of conclusion of <b>leasing</b> agreements will be unified, considering the large volume of <b>leasing</b> agreements concluded in our country each year. The aim of my dissertation was to cover the majority of the main lines of opinion on <b>leasing,</b> make a comparison of <b>leasing</b> and <b>lease</b> and to assess whether it is necessary to apply the statutory regulation of <b>lease</b> on <b>leasing</b> agreements. Another aim of the dissertation was to assess individual components of <b>leasing</b> relationship, i. e. its participants, subject and content (subjective rights and obligations), both on purely theoretical level {{and in terms of the}} specifics of <b>leasing</b> as reflected in concrete business terms and conditions.

5|$|The {{design was}} adopted by an Act of Parliament in 1813, which {{permitted}} the commissioners to borrow £600,000 for building and construction. The street was intended to have commercial purposes and {{it was expected that}} a majority of the income would come from private capital. Nash took responsibility for design and valuation of all properties. Construction of the road resulted in demolishing numerous properties, disrupting trade and polluting the air with dust. Existing tenants had first offer to purchase <b>leases</b> on the new properties. The Treasury supported the proposal because, in the aftermath of the lengthy Napoleonic Wars, there was an urgent need for the government to create jobs. Government expenditure was low because the design relied heavily upon private developers, such as Nash himself. The buildings were to be let on 99-year <b>leases,</b> as was common at the time, and income could be recouped in the form of ground rent.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of <b>leasing</b> of {{productive}} assets. When capital is <b>leased</b> (or rented), it is more easily repossessed and hence <b>leasing</b> has higher debt capacity and relaxes financing constraints. However, <b>leasing</b> gives rise to an agency problem {{with regard to the}} care with which the <b>leased</b> asset is used or maintained. We show that this implies that more credit constrained firms <b>lease</b> capital, while less credit constrained firms buy capital. Our theory is consistent with the explanation of <b>leasing</b> provided by <b>leasing</b> firms, namely that <b>leasing</b> “preserves capital, ” which is generally considered a fallacy in the academic literature. We provide empirical evidence that small and credit constrained firms <b>lease</b> a considerably larger fraction of their capital than larger and less constrained firms...|$|R
