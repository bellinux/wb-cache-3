30|$|Although {{there have}} been a lot of {{research}} works about <b>type</b> I <b>relay,</b> the research works about <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> are just started and relatively not enough. <b>Type</b> II <b>relay</b> has many advantages compared with <b>type</b> I <b>relay,</b> such as low cost (layer 2 relay), easy of deployment (transparent), and good throughput enhancement (cooperative transmission with eNodeB in downlink and UEs in uplink in nature). However, in order to exploit the benefits and potentials of the <b>type</b> II <b>relay,</b> more sophisticated designs are needed than <b>type</b> I <b>relay.</b> The transparency and backward compatibility requirement bring many challenges facing the implementation of the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> in LTE-Advanced systems [3, 6, 10]. Overall speaking, two issues of the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> are of most importance. One is the type II relay-assisted cooperative hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) [3] and the other is link adaptation for type II relay-assisted data transmission.

30|$|Relay {{is a very}} {{promising}} technique for future wireless communication systems to extend coverage and enhance throughput, and has drawn increasing interest from both academia and industry [1 – 6]. There are many <b>types</b> of <b>relays</b> {{and some of them}} have been specified for future mobile systems, such as WiMax and LTE-Advanced system [5]. Two <b>types</b> of <b>relays,</b> i.e., <b>type</b> I and type II, are mainly discussed for LTE-advanced systems in the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) [3, 7 – 9]. The <b>type</b> I <b>relay</b> is a kind of non-transparent relay with wireless backhaul to the donor eNodeB cell. The <b>type</b> I <b>relay</b> terminates all layers 2 and 3 protocols and appears as a normal eNodeB to user equipment (UE). According to the backhaul, <b>type</b> I <b>relay</b> can be classified into inband (same frequency band for backhaul link and access link) and half-duplex (backhaul transmission and access transmission at different time), inband and full-duplex (backhaul transmission and access transmission at same time), and outband (different frequency band for backhaul link and access link). The <b>type</b> I <b>relay</b> has its own cell and physical cell identification (ID). It transmits synchronization signals and performs resource allocation. The typical usage scenarios of <b>type</b> I <b>relay</b> include coverage extension, e.g., hotspot and deadspot, and group mobility, e.g., on a train or bus. On the other hand, the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> is a kind of inband transparent relay and works in a half-duplex mode. Usually, the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> only supports functions up to layer 2. <b>Type</b> II <b>relay</b> does not have a physical cell ID and is a part of a donor eNodeB cell. The eNodeB directly controls the UEs in the cell and performs resource allocation. The <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> transparently participates in data forwarding in downlink and uplink, i.e., the UE is not aware of {{whether or not it is}} communicating with the eNodeB via the relay. As a result, the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> should not transmit synchronization signal, common reference signal, etc. Therefore, the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> cannot be used for coverage extension and the main purpose of the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> is to enhance throughput and quality-of-service of UEs, especially for cell-edge UEs, in the macro cell.|$|R

40|$|As we move {{under the}} aegis of the Moore 2 ̆ 7 s law, we have to deal with its darker side with {{problems}} like leakage and short channel effects. Once we go beyond 45 nm regime process variations also have emerged as a significant design concern. Embedded memories uses sense amplifier for fast sensing and typically, sense amplifiers uses pair of matched transistors in a positive feedback environment. A small difference in voltage level of applied input signals to these matched transistors is amplified and the resulting logic signals are latched. Intra die variation causes mismatch between the sense transistors that should ideally be identical structures. Yield loss due to device and process variations has never been so critical to cause failure in circuits. Due to growth in size of embedded SRAMs as well as usage of sense amplifier based signaling techniques, process variations in sense amplifiers leads to significant loss of yield for that we need to come up with process variation tolerant circuit styles and new devices. In this work impact of transistor mismatch due to process variations on sense amplifier is evaluated and this problem is stated. For the solution of the problem a novel self compensation scheme on sense amplifiers is presented on different technology nodes up to 32 nm on conventional bulk MOSFET technology. Our results show that the self compensation technique in the conventional bulk MOSFET <b>latch</b> <b>type</b> sense amplifier not just gives improvement in the yield but also leads to improvement in performance for <b>latch</b> <b>type</b> sense amplifiers. Lithography related CD variations, fluctuations in dopant density, oxide thickness and parametric variations of devices are identified as a major challenge to the classical bulk type MOSFET. With the emerging nanoscale devices, SIA roadmap identifies FinFETs as a candidate for post-planar end-of-roadmap CMOS device. With current technology scaling issues and with conventional bulk type MOSFET on 32 nm node our technique can easily be applied to Double Gate devices. In this work, we also develop the model of Double Gate MOSFET through 3 D Device Simulator Damocles and TCAD simulator. We propose a FinFET based process variation tolerant sense amplifier design that exploits the back gate of FinFET devices for dynamic compensation against process variations. Results from statistical simulation show that the proposed dynamic compensation is highly effective in restoring yield at a level comparable to that of sense amplifiers without process variations. We created the 32 nm double gate models generated from Damocles 3 -D device simulations [25] and Taurus Device Simulator available commercially from Synopsys [47] and use them in the nominal <b>latch</b> <b>type</b> sense amplifier design and on the Independent Gate Self Compensation Sense Amplifier Design (IGSSA) to compare the yield and performance benefits of sense amplifier design on FinFET technology over the conventional bulk type CMOS based sense amplifier on 32 nm technology node effective in restoring yield at a level comparable to that of sense amplifiers without process variations.

For instance a <b>latch</b> <b>type,</b> or right angle bur, is only used in the slow speed handpiece with contra-angle attachment. Long shank or shaft is only used in the slow speed when the contra-angle is not in use, and finally a friction grip bur, which is a small bur, is used only in the high-speed handpiece.|$|R
50|$|Another <b>latching</b> <b>type</b> has a {{remanent}} core that {{retains the}} {{contacts in the}} operated position by the remanent magnetism in the core. This type requires a current pulse of opposite polarity to release the contacts. A variation uses a permanent magnet that produces part of the force required to close the contact; the coil supplies sufficient force to move the contact open or closed by aiding or opposing the field of the permanent magnet. A polarity controlled relay needs changeover switches or an H bridge drive circuit to control it. The relay may be less expensive than other types, but this is partly offset by the increased costs in the external circuit.|$|R
30|$|Simulation {{results show}} that the {{proposed}} algorithm is very close to optimal solutions found by exhaustive search, with low number of users and RB. When the number of users and RBs is growing, the proposed algorithm gives valuable performances enhancement compared to solutions without relay with the fixed relay selection strategies.

However, its complexity is higher, and it incurs additional overhead. Comparing the average power per user <b>type</b> (<b>relay,</b> relayed source and non-relayed source) and their location in the cell allows to conclude that the sub-optimal fixed relay strategy achieves a good compromise between transmit power decrease and complexity.|$|R

30|$|One {{major problem}} in using the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> in uplink data {{retransmission}} [10, 11] {{is caused by the}} backward compatibility requirement. As specified in LTE-Advanced specifications, when a legacy UE has both control information (e.g., ACK/NACK, periodic channel quality indicator (CQI) report, etc.), and data to be transmitted in the uplink, the UE should embed the control information in the data transmission in order to retain the single carrier-frequency division multiple access characteristics and to reduce peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Such a transmission requirement, i.e., embedding control information in data, brings difficulty for type II relay-assisted cooperative retransmission, where <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> monitors initial transmission of the UE and performs cooperative transmission to assist retransmission of UE when the initial transmission is failed. We assume that the UE has control information (e.g., ACK/NACK to different downlink data packets) to be transmitted at both initial transmission and retransmission. For simplicity, we denote the control information embedded in initial transmission as “old” control information and the control information embedded in retransmission as “new” control information. The <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> can only know the old control information through monitoring and detecting the initial transmission but cannot know the new control information to be transmitted by the UE in advance before the retransmission. Therefore, <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> will have difficulty in performing the retransmission. If the <b>type</b> II <b>relay</b> sends exactly the same signals as the initial transmission of the UE, i.e., with the old control information, the old control information from the relay and the new control information from the UE will collide at the eNodeB. If the relay punctures the old control information in cooperative retransmission, the eNodeB receives the control information only from the UE but a superposed reference signal from both the relay and the UE. Consequently, channel estimation mismatch occurs for the control information and results in unacceptable detection performance of the control information.|$|R
