40|$|Gingivitis and <b>lumpy</b> <b>jaw</b> are {{diseases}} of polymicrobial aetiology. Although Fusobacterium necrophorum {{has been associated}} with these diseases in macropods, little is known about other organisms associated with these diseases in this animal species. PCR-DGGE analysis revealed the potential pathogens associated with gingivitis and <b>lumpy</b> <b>jaw</b> in macropods. PCR-DGGE profile comparison between the healthy and disease groups indicated a shift in the oral bacterial community structures with similarity coefficients of 48 % and 35 % for gingivitis and <b>lumpy</b> <b>jaw</b> respectively. Moreover, gingivitis was associated with increase in bacterial diversity (Shannon index = 2. 87; PL curve = 45 %) while <b>lumpy</b> <b>jaw</b> resulted in a decline in bacterial diversity (Shannon index = 2. 47; PL curve = 74 %). This study suggest that the establishment of gingivitis and <b>lumpy</b> <b>jaw</b> diseases follows the ecological plaque hypothesis. This forms the basis for an expanded investigation in an epidemiological scale and suggests the need for the appropriate choice of antimicrobial agent(s) and for the effective management and control of polymicrobial diseases.

40|$|Fusobacterium necrophorum is an {{important}} aetiological agent of periodontal diseases (gingivitis and <b>lumpy</b> <b>jaw)</b> in captive macropods. The leukotoxin encoded by the lktA gene is a major virulence factor of F. necrophorum. In the present study, lktA gene sequences were detected by PCR in the oral cavity of 21 / 58 (36 %) captive yellow footed rock wallabies and mainland tammar wallabies at two zoological parks in South Australia. This suggest that F. necrophorum encoded lktA may not {{be present in the}} oral cavity of all captive wallabies or that it is present at low levels, i. e. close to the limits of detection of conventional PCR. The lktA sequences had 98 - 100 % homology to a sequence detected in ovine foot lesions infected with F. necrophorum. Cluster analysis of the partial lktA gene sequence revealed two clades of the lktA gene of F. necrophorum in macropods and calls for a detailed study using the whole gene sequence.

40|$|T H E {{diagnosis}} of human actinomycosis {{is not always}} made with ease, and furthermore {{the identification of the}} causative species is usually quite dif-ficult. In medical literature cases are frequently reported as actinomycosis followed by the statement, unable to culture, culture lost, not able to identify, etc. The species in some cases is not of great interest to the physician; how-ever, the laboratory should always attempt to identify the organism. The disease may be either localized or generalized. It is usually chronic and the duration is from several months to several years. It is thus fre-quently misdiagnosed " tuberculosis. '' In 1925, Sanford and Voelker 1 reviewed 670 cases that had been ob-served up to that year in the United States, and of these only 2 per cent showed generalized involvement.

40|$|Objective: This {{case report}} {{describes}} a clinical case of Johne's disease (JD) in a Friesian calf aging one and half years. Materials and methods: Physical {{examination of the}} calf was carried out, history of the farm as well as samples for laboratory examinations were obtained. The laboratory examinations included hematological examinations by direct wet mount, hematocrit centrifugation technique and Giemsa stain, biochemical evaluation of serum, bacterial culture and isolation from feces and aspirate from the swollen jaw. Results: Clinical history showed that the farm {{had a history of}} JD, and routine health screening revealed that one of the calves had clinical signs suggestive of Johne's disease. Physical examination of the calf revealed a <b>lumpy</b> <b>jaw,</b> enlarged bilateral pre-scapular and pre-femoral lymph nodes, while hematological and biochemical findings showed a normocytic normochromic anemia, severe leukocytosis with neutropilic left shift and lymphocytosis with hyperproteinemia characterized by hyperglobulinemia. Fecal bacterial tests showed the presence of acid fast bacilli. Based on the history and laboratory findings, the cow was diagnosed with JD. In order to ensure effective control measures, the calf was culled from the heard. Postmortem examination revealed inflamed pre-scapular and pre-femoral lymph nodes with the presence of paramphistomes in the rumen mucosa. Conclusion: Since JD is a chronic disease that lingers in livestock farms, there is need for early identification and culling of infected animal in order to limit its devastation on the farm.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1981 Dr. John Douglas BurtonJaw disease in kangaroos and wallabies, while uncommon in animals living in the free state, is {{a major cause of}} death in captive macropods. There are two major schools of thought regarding its aetiology. The first accepts the findings of Fox (1923) and considers the disease to be actinomycosis while the second believes jaw disease to be one manifestation of necrobacillosis. Regardless of the belief of the authors the clinical and pathological descriptions indicate the condition attacking macropods throughout the world is a single disease. Over one hundred affected macropods were examined {{during the course of this}} study and few species were found to be spared from jaw disease. Cases of <b>lumpy</b> <b>jaw</b> most commonly occurred in the winter months. All ages of macropods were affected although a higher prevalence was recorded in younger animals; however this may have been a reflection of the age of macropods in the zoo under study. The most common site of infection was the premolar and anterior molar region of the oral cavity, regardless of the age of the animal. The gross pathological findings were similar to the descriptions of affected animals by various authors throughout the world. The site of infection could generally be recognized at the gingival crevice, commonly between teeth, and excessive calculus formation associated with gingivitis and gingival recession was a common finding in affected animals. Penetration of the gingival mucosae by plant fibre was not found to be a significant predisposing factor in the initiation of the disease. (For complete abstract open document.) Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|Three new species, Eubacterium nodatum, Eubacterium timidum, and Eubacterium brachy, were described, {{primarily}} from subgingival samples taken from patients with moderate and severe adult periodontitis. Except for {{the isolation of}} E. brachy from a pleuropulmonary infection, these species have not been reported from other infected body sites. We report on the isolation of these species and an undescribed group (D- 6) of asaccharolytic eubacteria also found in periodontal disease from numerous different sites of infection, mostly the head and neck. A similarity in cellular morphological properties of E. nodatum and Actinomyces sp. was noted previously. Additional similarities, particularly to Actinomyces israelii, that we found are the formation of molar tooth colonies and the isolation from cases of <b>lumpy</b> <b>jaw</b> and from the genital tract of women {{in association with the}} use of an intrauterine contraceptive device. E. timidum and E. brachy did not occur more often from any particular site outside of the head, neck, and respiratory tract. The group D- 6 strains came from a variety of sites in the trunk and pelvis. These species are all obligately anaerobic, asaccharolytic, and generally nonreactive, and they grow poorly and slowly on media commonly used to isolate anaerobic bacteria. L-Lysine (0. 5 %) markedly stimulated the growth of E. nodatum and, to a lesser extent, another acetate- and butyrate-producing group, Eubacterium sp. group D- 6, but we did not find comparable stimulants for the other species. We found the production of phenyl acetate to be a helpful marker in the identification of E. timidum and Eubacterium sp. group D- 6. Although the isolation and identification of most of these species remain somewhat difficult, the evidence from dental infections and the present report suggests that these species are potential pathogens that are likely to be overlooked in infected clinical material without special attention to more prolonged incubation and use of enriched isolation media...|$|E

Physicians {{must be aware of}} typical clinical presentations (such as cervicofacial actinomycosis following dental focus of infection, pelvic actinomycosis in women with an intrauterine device, and pulmonary actinomycosis in smokers with poor dental hygiene), but also that actinomycosis may mimic the malignancy process in various anatomical sites. Bacterial cultures and pathology are the cornerstone of diagnosis, but particular conditions are required {{in order to get the}} correct diagnosis. Prolonged bacterial cultures in anaerobic conditions are necessary to identify the bacterium and typical microscopic findings include necrosis with yellowish sulfur granules and filamentous Gram-positive fungal-like pathogens. Patients with actinomycosis require prolonged (6 - to 12 -month) high doses (to facilitate the drug penetration in abscess and in infected tissues) of penicillin G or amoxicillin, but the duration of antimicrobial therapy could probably be shortened to 3 months in patients in whom optimal surgical resection of infected tissues has been performed. Preventive measures, such as reduction of alcohol abuse and improvement of dental hygiene, may limit occurrence of pulmonary, cervicofacial, and central nervous system actinomycosis. In women, intrauterine devices must be changed every 5 years in order to limit the occurrence of pelvic actinomycosis.
