5|$|Around the planisphere {{moves the}} rete, a {{web-like}} metal cutout representing the zodiac, which {{also features a}} Julian calendar dial. Above the rete, a display indicates {{the day of the}} week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each <b>leap</b> <b>year</b> on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the retes calendar dial. The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.|$|E

25|$|Mostly, {{a year is}} a <b>leap</b> <b>year</b> if it is evenly {{divisible}} by four. A year divisible by 100, however, is not a <b>leap</b> <b>year</b> in the Gregorian calendar {{unless it}} is also divisible by 400. For example, 1600 was a <b>leap</b> <b>year,</b> but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. Some programs may have relied on the oversimplified rule that a year divisible by four is a <b>leap</b> <b>year.</b> This method works fine for the year 2000 (because it is a <b>leap</b> <b>year),</b> and will not become a problem until 2100, when older legacy programs will likely have long since been replaced. Other programs contained incorrect <b>leap</b> <b>year</b> logic, assuming for instance that no year divisible by 100 could be a <b>leap</b> <b>year.</b> An assessment of this <b>leap</b> <b>year</b> problem including a number of real life code fragments appeared in 1998. For information on why century years are treated differently, see Gregorian calendar.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, some programmers had {{misunderstood}} the Gregorian calendar {{rule that}} determines whether years that are exactly divisible by 100 are not leap years, and assumed the year 2000 {{would not be}} a <b>leap</b> <b>year.</b> Years divisible by 100 are not leap years, except for years that are divisible by 400. Thus the year 2000 was a <b>leap</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Thai Chulasakarat {{calendar}} uses {{a slightly}} different method to place the intercalary day. Instead {{of it in a}} <b>leap</b> <b>year</b> as in the Burmese system, the Thai system places it in a separate year. Thus, the Thai small <b>leap</b> <b>year</b> has 355 days while the Thai great <b>leap</b> <b>year</b> has 384 days. Both systems arrive at the same number of days in a 19-year cycle however. Furthermore, in contrast to Indian calendars, the Burmese calendar follows a Metonic cycle in which intercalary months are inserted on a set schedule. However, because the Burmese calendar has to adjust for the use of Indian-calendar-derived sidereal years with the Metonic cycle's tropical years, maintaining a set Metonic cycle has been a challenge.|$|E
25|$|The Coptic {{year is the}} {{extension}} of the ancient Egyptian civil year, retaining its subdivision into the three seasons, four months each. The three seasons are commemorated by special prayers in the Coptic Liturgy. This calendar is still in use all over Egypt by farmers {{to keep track of the}} various agricultural seasons. The Coptic calendar has 13 months, 12 of 30 days each and an intercalary month at the end of the year of 5 or 6 days, depending whether the year is a <b>leap</b> <b>year</b> or not. The year starts on 29 August in the Julian Calendar or on the 30th in the year before (Julian) Leap Years. The Coptic <b>Leap</b> <b>Year</b> follows the same rules as the Julian Calendar so that the extra month always has six days in the year before a Julian <b>Leap</b> <b>Year.</b>|$|E

In addition, the years 2100, 2200, and so on, were regarded as leap years.
