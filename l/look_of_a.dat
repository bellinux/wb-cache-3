5|$|After World of Motion {{had closed}} on January 2, 1996, {{everything}} inside the ride building was removed. After, new track was constructed {{outside of the}} building which is used as the high-speed test for Test Track. Work inside the building also continued at the same time. It was scheduled to open 29 months after World of Motion's closing, in May 1997, but after numerous problems rose, the ride opening was delayed by nearly 2 years. Also, the cars used on the ride were designed to resemble the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> test car {{that is used to}} go through multiple safety tests.|$|E
5|$|For {{slow motion}} scenes like with bullets and drops of water, twin Phantom {{high-speed}} cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second. A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the Resident Evil 5 game was recreated shot-by-shot {{for the film}} and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film. The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers {{were not able to}} use existing equipment such as Steadicam rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a Segway to achieve the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Steadicam shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen. A 1983 Yak-52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.|$|E
5|$|Shyamalan and cinematographer Eduardo Serra chose several {{camera angles}} to {{simulate}} the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comic book panel. Various visual narrative motifs were also applied. Several scenes relating to the Mr. Glass character involve glass. As a newborn, he is primarily seen reflected in mirrors, and as a young child, he is seen reflected in a blank TV screen. When he leaves his calling card on the windshield of David Dunn's car, he is reflected in a glass frame in his art gallery. Jackson requested his walking stick be made of glass to make his character more menacing. Using purple as Mr. Glass' color to David Dunn's green was also Jackson's idea. Mr. Glass' wig was modeled after Afro-American statesman Frederick Douglass. As he does in his other films, Shyamalan makes a cameo appearance. He plays a man David suspects of dealing drugs inside the stadium.|$|E

5|$|The makeup for the Trill host {{featured}} a separate nose and forehead pieces, as the {{intention was to}} retain the general <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human. Air bladders were placed inside a fake abdomen to create the shot in which the symbiont appeared to move under the host's skin. A second fake abdomen was created for the surgery scene in which the symbiont is moved into Riker, which worked by having a crew member lie under the surgery table, pulling the symbiont into the opening using a concealed string. The design of the symbiont {{was based on a}} caterpillar with an octopus for a head, which {{featured a}} further air bladder in order to give the appearance that it was pulsating and painted in fluorescent paint to glow when a black light was shone on it during that scene.|$|E

5000|$|This {{basic concept}} is more {{correctly}} {{known as an}} aspirating skimmer, since some skimmer designs using an aspirator do not use a [...] "Pin-Wheel"/"Adrian-Wheel" [...] or [...] "Needle-Wheel". [...] "Pin-Wheel"/"Adrian-Wheel" [...] describes the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impeller that consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disk with pins mounted perpendicular (90°) to the disc and parallel to the rotor. [...] "Needle-Wheel" [...] describes the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impeller that consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> pins projecting out perpendicular to the rotor from a central axis. [...] "Mesh-Wheel" [...] describes the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impeller that consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mesh material attached to a plate or central axis on the rotor. The purpose of these modified impellers is to chop or shred the air that is introduced via a venturi apparatus or external air pump into very fine bubbles. The Mesh-Wheel design is fairly new and, while providing excellent results {{in the short term}} because of its ability to draw in more air and create finer bubbles with its thin cutting surfaces, it is still being developed and will likely continue to evolve over a few more years.|$|R

In the event, the dessert was a disaster {{and could not be}} served properly. Robert Morley had also been consulted on the menu and said he felt that Mrs Troake's original coffee pudding was perfect.|$|E
25|$|Todmorden has the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Victorian mill town. Other notable {{buildings}} include Dobroyd Castle (completed in 1869), {{now used}} as a residential activity centre for schoolchildren; the Edwardian Hippodrome Theatre, and the Grade I listed Todmorden Unitarian Church (built 1865–1869). Dobroyd Castle, the town hall and the Unitarian church were all built {{at the behest of}} John Fielden and his sons and designed by John Gibson, who {{had been a member of}} Charles Barry's team at the Houses of Parliament. Pre-Victorian buildings include two 18thcentury pubs; Todmorden Old Hall, a Grade II* listed manor house (Elizabethan) in the centre of town, and St. Mary's Church which dates from 1476.|$|E
25|$|The Pockets: {{the pockets}} of a Neapolitan jackets are curved and applied as patches; the breast pocket is called “a barchetta”, which means “little boat”, due to the higher top corner of the pocket, which, along with the rounded bottom, gives it {{the shape of a}} stylized boat. The side pockets are equally curved, and their shape recalls that of a pot – hence the name “a pignata”. Neither of these {{features}} have any practical functionality, but they are particular to Neapolitan tailoring and they contribute to the sophisticated yet relaxed <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> jacket made in Naples. As an ultimate touch of elegance, double hand finished stitching runs throughout the sides of the patch pockets – a recurring feature in informal Neapolitan tailoring.|$|E

25|$|Proton {{sought to}} create a new {{signature}} façade with the Prevé. The result is Proton Wings, a unified design element that fuses the headlights, Proton emblem and air-intake grille, giving it a distinctive <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bird ascending. The Prevé is the first Malaysian-made car to be factory-fitted with LED position lamps. The exterior of the car was styled to sport a reduced drag coefficient in an effort to enhance fuel efficiency. Proton collaborated with Italy-based Italdesign Giugiaro S.p.A for the styling and likeness of the Prevé. Italdesign is also responsible for the styling of the 2010 Proton Tuah concept car. Additionally, Azlan Othman, Proton's Head of Styling was dispatched to Turin under the collaboration with Italdesign which lasted almost a year.|$|E
25|$|Morris Louis's {{painting}} Where 1960, {{was a major}} {{innovation that}} moved abstract expressionist painting forward {{in a new direction}} toward Color Field and Minimalism. Among Louis's major works are his various series of color field paintings. Some of his best known series' are the Unfurleds, the Veils, the Florals and the Stripes or Pillars. From 1929 to 1933, Louis studied at the Maryland Institute of Fine and Applied Arts (now Maryland Institute College of Art). He worked at various odd jobs to support himself while painting and in 1935 was president of the Baltimore Artists' Association. From 1936 to 1940, he lived in New York and worked in the easel division of the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project. During this period, he knew Arshile Gorky, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jack Tworkov, returning to Baltimore in 1940. In 1948, he started to use Magna – oil-based acrylic paints. In 1952, Louis moved to Washington, D.C. Living in Washington, D.C., somewhat apart from the New York scene and working almost in isolation. He and a group of artists that included Kenneth Noland were central to the development of Color Field painting. The basic point about Louis's work and that of other Color Field painters, sometimes known as the Washington Color School in contrast to most of the other new approaches of the late 1950s and early 1960s, is that they greatly simplified the idea of what constitutes the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finished painting.|$|E
25|$|The site of {{the church}} and former monastery of San Juan Bautista was a teocalli, or sacred precinct, {{dedicated}} to a god of commerce called Yacapitzauac. This teocalli was destroyed by the Spanish under Gonzalo de Sandoval when he captured and sacked the settlement in 1521. This teocalli and god were the center of the pre-Hispanic community. The Franciscans were the first to arrive in the 1520s to evangelize the local population and they built a small church on the site. However, this church was destroyed in a fire. The Augustinians took over evangelization in the 1530s and formally established the monastery, dedicated to John the Baptist. This figure was chosen because Yacapitzauac was depicted with a staff as a sign of his authority, and John the Baptist is often depicted with a staff. Most of the monastery was constructed between 1535 and 1540. At that time, there was sufficient income to the order to not only finish much of the monastery in a short time, but also to add a number of fine details. Construction of a number of smaller elements continued until 1586. The complex presents similarities with others built by the Augustinians in eastern Morelos at this time, such as a stone wall around the perimeter and the use of merlons, which give these monasteries the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> medieval castle. Due to the diminishing importance of Yecapixtla, the monastery was mostly abandoned by the 17th century, with the Augustinians losing formal control {{of the church and}} community in the mid 18th century. The complex remained mostly untouched until the late 19th century, when Father José Pilar Sandoval did some remodeling work in the main nave of the church. More restoration work was undertaken by Father Evaristo Nava in the early 20th century, which included the addition of an organ and changing the sacristy into a tabernacle. In 1994, the complex became part of the Monasteries on the Slopes of Popocatépetl World Heritage Site.|$|E
