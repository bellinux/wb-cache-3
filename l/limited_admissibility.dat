Even more unlikely is the prospect that a juror who understands the instruction will be psychologically capable of obeying it. The only practical impact of this <b>limited</b> <b>admissibility</b> is that the evidence cannot be used to prop up a weak case {{that would otherwise be}} dismissed by the court for insufficient evidence, as it was admitted only for the impeachment of a witness.|$|E

An integrated approach may represent {{the best way of}} following the modern contextual approach, while remaining faithful to the original intent behind the Indian Evidence Act...|$|E

40|$|The {{disparity}} between norms and their enforcement is a recurrent theme in international law. An examination {{of theory and}} practice undertaken {{in the first part}} of the research reviews national, internationalised/hybrid and international judicial processes. This identifies both normative and structural weakness in the existent system for the enforcement of international criminal law. The second half of the study compares the relationship that is established between the International Criminal Court and national authorities with previous models to determine whether the Rome Statute promises heightened prospects for actual enforcement. The study suggests that the reliance of the ICC on the support of national authorities will result in a persistence of enforcement gaps in the compliance levels of States with their pre-existing duty to prosecute crimes; in the ability of the Court to secure enforcement of its requests and orders; and in the own Court's operational capacity. Evidence suggests, nonetheless, that the ICC is also helping to close enforcement gaps. At the national level, in particular, because of the Court's jurisdictional and admissibility regime, the ICC is altering incentive structures for national authorities and profoundly altering State behaviour. This has been driven primarily by the desire of States to <b>limit</b> <b>admissibility</b> challenges to domestic jurisdiction based on legislative inconsistencies or domestic inaction. The research shows that the successful closing of enforcement gaps will require the close and effective interaction of national and international jurisdictions. For the treaty signed in Rome is not just about a Court, it is about a system; a global system based on national States. Without national authorities, the ICC will be unable to act. But also conversely, without the catalytic presence of the ICC, it is unlikely that national authorities would be willing to act. As such, the ICC Statute acts as both a standard setting instrument and a compliance-inducing mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs) in a generic spacetime is {{often associated with}} a non-physical choice of coordinates and can be cured by <b>limiting</b> the <b>admissibility</b> of such coordinates. Lichnerowicz conditions, for instance, represent a criterion for admissibility. The result, however, is a very restrictive limitation which may imply “removal” of important regions (with respect to the peculiarity of phenomena which may happen there) of the spacetime manifold. We consider here {{the point of view of}} a family of observers (Fundamental Slicing Observers, FSO) having their world lines orthogonal to the surfaces of constant coordinate time. We say that the time coordinate has not a global character if the associated FSO change their causality condition in the domain of validity of the coordinates themselves. Furthermore, in those regions where FSO have no more timelike world lines, CTCs are present and one may think of special devices or investigation tools apt to operationally detect them.

Finally, we will discuss the difficulties in using prior bad acts evidence. Because batterers tend to engage in repeated acts of abuse, evidence of prior acts may be particularly relevant in proving the extent of harm and predicting the likelihood of future abuse.

Scholars had been urged the introduction of this remedy for decades, but now its practical functioning presents several problems, concerning not only the legal <b>limits</b> to its <b>admissibility,</b> but also the rationale behind certain strictly procedural rules: especially, the application for a mandatory order must be made asking together a quashing order or a declaratory judgment (declaring a public body’s failure to act unlawful).

40|$|The {{trends in}} force about the {{municipal}} urbanistic plans foreshadow a progressive overcoming {{of the traditional}} quantitative approach, based on the need's account, trough the traditional relation between inhabitants and habitations and the one between inhabitants and public spaces. Putting together the most recent innovative suggestions about the urbanistic and environmental matters, a methodological proposal of sizing has been formulated, referring to specific objects (residence, production, infrastructures) and territorial contexts, articulated in five phases: 1) Needs' recognition, or the identification and {{the assessment of the}} settlement's needs in relation to the housing request and to the consequent services demand. 2) Assignment of the settlement's loads. 3) Proportioning, that is that phase which allows to transform the settlement's load into a physical impediment. It means that it expresses the physical transformation of the settlement's units. 4) Localization, or the individuation of the areas where the settlement's loads land and outspread, because of the proportioning. 5) Urbanistic organization. It is proposed, then, an approach in which the sizing is interpreted {{in the light of the}} sustainability principle. That principle is meant as immanent to the five phases of the procedure, as it is referred to the search of the settlements load's <b>limits</b> of <b>admissibility...</b>|$|R

To address them jointly, we then propose an original approach which consists of projecting a probability distribution onto a set of admissible measures. The proposed algorithm permits to handle arbitrary constraints and automatically generates efficient sampling patterns for MRI as shown on realistic simulations. We achieve a 20 -fold undersampling factor at very high 2 D resolution (100 µm isotropic) on physically plausible sampling tra-jectories with a gain in SNR of 2 - 3 dB on reconstructed MR images as compared to more standard sampling patterns (e. g. radial, spiral) ...|$|R

Overall, many important questions related to sampling theory remain open. In this work, we address one of them: given a set of hardware constraints (e. g. sampling Fourier coefficients along smooth curves), how to optimally design a sampling pattern?

The MR images reconstructed using the proposed approach have a significantly higher SNR (2 - 3 dB) than those reconstructed using more standard sampling patterns (e. g. radial, spiral), both for medium and very high resolution imaging. Likewise, reconstructions from highly undersampled data acquired in experiments performed on a 7 T SIEMENS MR scanner show the superiority of our sampling schemes over traditional MR samplings and proved that very large acceleration factor (up to 40 -fold) are practically achievable with CS-MRI...|$|R
40|$|Confession law is in a {{state of}} collapse. Fifty years ago, three {{different}} doctrines imposed constitutional <b>limits</b> on the <b>admissibility</b> of confessions in criminal cases: Miranda doctrine under the Fifth Amendment, Massiah doctrine under the Sixth Amendment, and voluntariness doctrine under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. But in recent years, the Supreme Court has gutted Miranda and Massiah, effectively leaving suspects with only voluntariness doctrine to protect them during police interrogations. The voluntariness test is a notoriously vague case-by-case standard. In this Article, I argue that if voluntariness is going to be the framework for confession law going forward, courts will need to disentangle the complex of values that is discussed under that heading and then use their clarified understanding as the basis for a judicially administrable rubric for regulating interrogation practices. As a matter of history and current practice, I argue that there are two different strands within voluntariness doctrine—one deontological strand that focuses on the offensiveness of the police methods used and one consequentialist strand that is concerned with the problem of false confessions. Courts could profit from disentangling those strands and creating different tests for each. Once the two strands are separated, voluntariness doctrine can move toward rules that are tailored to the distinctive values animating each strand. Toward that end, I propose different tests for determining the voluntariness of confessions going forward depending on which of the two strands is implicated in a given case...|$|R
40|$|We study routing and {{scheduling}} in multihop wireless networks. When data {{is transmitted from}} its source node to its destination node it may go through other wireless nodes as intermediate hops. The data trans-mission is node constrained, i. e. every node can trans-mit data to at most one neighboring node per time step. The transmission rates are time varying {{as a result of}} the changing wireless channel conditions. In this paper we assume that the data arrivals and transmission rates are governed by an adversary. The power of the adversary is <b>limited</b> by an <b>admissibility</b> condition which forbids the adversary from overloading any wireless node a priori. The node constrained trans-mission and the time-varying nature of the transmission rates make our model di®erent from and harder than the standard adversarial queueing model which relates to wireline networks. For the case in which the adversary speci¯es the paths that the data must follow, we design scheduling algorithms that ensure network stability. These algo-rithms try to give priority to data that is closest to its source node. However, at each time step only a subset of the data queued at a node is eligible for scheduling. One of our algorithms is fully distributed. For the case in which the adversary does not dictate the data paths, we show how to route the data so that the admissibility condition is satis¯ed. We can then schedule data along the chosen paths using our stable scheduling algorithms. We conclude by discussing the performance of distributed load balancing algorithms for combined routing {{and scheduling}}. ...|$|R
40|$|New {{laws and}} {{policies}} aimed at protecting {{victims of domestic}} violence have been adopted across the country over the last twenty years. The legal approaches taken to protect battered women and control family violence have resulted in significant changes in family law. New laws include statutes permitting civil protection or restraining orders, and laws requiring that domestic violence be considered in custody and/or visitation decisions. Both of these types of statutory reforms can provide protection to adult {{victims of domestic violence}} and their children. Evaluating a parent 2 ̆ 7 s fitness by considering past acts of violence to other family members results in decisions that are more likely to protect children than decisions that discount or disregard spousal abuse. Civil protection orders can provide abused women and their children with a quick and easily accessible remedy that provides housing, financial relief, and an order for custody. While there is some controversy about the effectiveness of such orders in cases involving severe violence, most advocates and scholars agree that these statutes can make some improvement in the lives of women and children. The effectiveness of these new laws in reducing the incidence of domestic violence, however, has been limited for a number of reasons. One of the major barriers to using these laws to protect women is that proving domestic violence in court is difficult. First, the victim is often the only witness to the abuse. For a variety of reasons, victims are reluctant to testify against their abusers and pursue civil and criminal remedies. Even when they do testify, women who experience domestic violence are often not believed. Despite changes in legal and popular conceptions of domestic violence, judges and juries continue to ignore or discount victims 2 ̆ 7 testimony about the abuse. It is, therefore, essential for practitioners to be able to introduce as much evidence of the abuse as they can gather. Established principles of evidence law, however, present particular challenges in domestic violence litigation. While there is expansive literature on evidentiary challenges in criminal prosecutions for domestic violence, there is very little written about the way courts have looked at particular evidentiary issues in civil cases where domestic violence is at issue. This article is intended to assist practitioners in anticipating and responding to some of the evidentiary challenges in civil cases in which relief is sought for the victims of domestic violence. First, expert testimony is often necessary to dispel common myths about battered women and to educate judges and juries about the dynamics of domestic violence.

5000|$|The still unsolved affair {{goes back}} to what the former forced prostitutes said when being interviewed again by the police in 2000. They claim that the former vice {{president}} of the Leipzig's Country Court (Landgericht), who was their judge in the trial of 1994, Jürgen Niemeyer, was one of the visitors in the brothel. Further the women claim, that Norbert Röger as well was a former visitor in the brothel. Back then he was a public prosecutor in Leipzig and since January 2011, he is President of the Country Court in Chemnitz (Landgericht Chemnitz). The policemen who conducted the interrogation, later denied to speak publicly about it. In 2003 in the Saxony State Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Landesamt für Verfassungsschutz Sachsen - LfV) a department for organized crime (OK) was established. This unit had ten employees and was headed by the former public prosecutor Simone Henneck (now Skroch). One of the case complexes of this unit, which was internally registered under the operation name 'offside' (German 'Abseits'), had alleged mafia structures in Leipzig as subject. These included suspected illegal land transactions in the 1990s, prostitution, blackmail and cross-links between political, judicial and criminal persons. This complex was also associated with the assassination attempt on Klockzin in 1994. From 2004 to 2006 the unit assembled files of 15.600 pages that fill about 100 folders together. The jurisdiction of a domestic intelligence agency investigating organized crime was controversial from the start (in Germany this is normally part of specialized police units). In July 2005, the Saxony Constitutional Court (sächsische Verfassungsgerichtshof) declared the State Constitutional Protection Act (Landesverfassungsschutzgesetz) of that time as partly unconstitutional and thus <b>limited</b> the <b>admissibility</b> of an observation of organized crime by the department within the Saxony State Office for the Protection of the Constitution (LfV). On 12 August 2005 a report was issued. It overlooked the situation and concluded, that 'the aspect of a danger for the constitution and the free, basic democratic order in Germany ... in all case complexes was given'. On the basis of this report, the former Minister of the Interior Thomas de Maizière decided, that the observation of organized crime, including the case of complex 'offside' by the domestic intelligence agency will continue. It is said, that Mr de Maizière appreciated the work of Simone Henneck (now Skroch) and her department, but he was not taking care for a criminal investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office (Staatsanwaltschaft), nor did he inform the parliament on the available evidence. Since 2014 in Germany a discussion started, in which way he may unconsciously or aware has protected the perpetrators by doing it that way. The report from the 12 August 2005 shall show, that the Saxony State Office for the Protection of the Constitution (LfV) knew of alleged sexual abuse of children by named and known prosecutors and judges {{in the second quarter of}} 2005 already. In March 2006, the Data Protection Supervisor (Datenschutzbeauftragter) of the Free State of Saxony, Andreas Schurig, launched a review in how far the department for organized crime (OK) still collects data - because it only had a limited mandate to monitor organized crime. He concluded, that the documents were collected illegally and should be destroyed. The department was disbanded in 2006. On 15 May 2007 the Parliamentary Control Commission (Parlamentarische Kontrollkommission) of the Saxony Parliament decided, in accordance with Albrecht Buttolo (who followed Mr de Maiziere as Minister for the Interior in November 2005), that the material is not to be deleted, but should be used to further brighten the identified issues. Also in May 2007, the first media reports surfaced on the content of the files from the disbanded department and the so-called 'offside' case complex. There the names Niemeyer and Röger appeared as potential customers in the brothel. In a speech at a special meeting of the Saxony parliament on 5 June 2007, the Minister for the Interior Mr Buttolo confirmed the existence of active and dangerous criminal networks in Saxony, this speech became known as the 'Mafia-Speech'. The General Attorney's Office of Germany (Bundesanwaltschaft) was informed and had a look into the issue, but in June 2007 declared, that there is no reasonable suspicion for the existence of a criminal organization/network. The Prosecuting Attorney's Office of Dresden (Staatsanwaltschaft Dresden) began to investigate against judge Jürgen Niemeyer on the basis of obstruction of justice in the time between end of June to early July 2007. It received intelligence files from 'offside III' complex. In early July 2007, when the so-called 'Saxony corruption affair' or 'Saxonyswamp' became a topic in different national media, the Saxony State Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which controllership was recently given to Reinhard Boos, assumed that the head of the department for organized crime, Simone Henneck, had tampered with the files. She made it look like that reports, which were exclusively based on the information from Detective Chief Inspector Georg Wehling, would also have been supported by other neutral sources. After that, an internal investigation against Henneck was initiated. Chief prosecutor Christian Avenarius, the spokesman for the Prosecuting Attorney's Office of Dresden (Staatsanwaltschaft Dresden) said, that the material of the police officer hardly contained any reliable facts that would make legal proceedings reasonable. On the 26 August 2007, two months after his 'Mafia-Speech', the Minister for the Interior distanced himself clearly from what he said in that speech. At the time he completely trusted the accuracy of the material, now however, under the given circumstances of significant errors in the elaboration the material, the information is questionable. Data collection and data analysis was put together and a check on the credibility of the information has not been made. The reports filed by the chief inspector did not stand tests by the Prosecuting Attorney's Office (Staatsanwaltschaft) and the State Office for Criminal Investigations (Landeskriminalamt). Many references were false or overstated. This is not a 'swamp', you can not even of talk about 'larger puddles anymore'. An external review committee headed by the retired judge from the Federal Court (Bundesgerichtshof), Dietrich Beyer, which included also former director of the Hessian Saxony State Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Lutz Irrgang, stated in its interim report serious deficiencies in Saxony's State Office for the Protection of the Constitution, particularly with the department for organized crime (OK). Intelligence service regulations have been violated to a significant extent, the supervision of the department has been neglected by both, the board of directors as well as the Ministry of the Interior (Innenministerium). Members of the unit had insufficient intelligence training to obtain information, policemen from the intermediate service had been used. The head of the department itself had not any specialized training or further education. Source reports were not questioned on their resilience, even self-evident inconclusive information has been processed as applicable. Contrary to corresponding units in other federal states, who analyze data to advise the government and coordinate with the police authorities, the unit of Saxony tried to find suspicious circumstances at any price and individual employees acted 'grimly' and 'overeager'. The result was a 'disaster'. In the lawsuit from 2008 the two girl's who were forced into prostitution declared, that the high-level lawyers of Leipzig were their punters in the Jasmine. The convicted pimp Martin Kugler testified, that his lawyer back then agreed with the court on a lenient sentence, provided that Kugler will not wash 'dirty laundry'. However, this assertion was later revoked by Kugler. The Public Prosecutor's Office (Staatsanwaltschaft) gave no credibility to the testimony of the women and canceld the investigation against the lawyers; both lawyers received compensation from the state of Saxony. The investigating officers were displaced, the commissariat K26 was dissolved. In addition, several cases against Georg Wehling, the former head of K26 were initiated and he was suspended from duty. Against the former forced prostitutes who testified as witnesses in the trial against the lawyers, a process was initiated on 15 December 2011 at the District Court of Dresden, on the basis of libel. That process was officially opened on 6 March 2012. A connection with the inconsistencies on the so-called 'ownerless properties', which were sold in Leipzig during the past few years in the hundreds, has not been demonstrated, but is examined by a group of parliamentarians of the Saxony parliament. It is checked whether the same group of people involved in that do play a role in the Saxonyswamp as well. However, to that parliamentary committee (Landtagsuntersuchungsausschuss) for the inquiry of the 'Saxonyswamp' the city of Leipzig presents a -No-, when it comes to the question of accessing corresponding files in the archive. Mayor Jung was citing an evaluation from which making these files public would be unlawful, because they are not part of the investigation. Simone Skroch (formerly Henneck), former Head of the department organized crime at the LfV, confirmed as a key witness in the investigation committee of the 'Landtag' (legislative assembly in Germany) beginning in March 2013, that the 'existence of continuously acting structures of the former Ministry of State Security (Ministerium für Staatssicherheit - MfS / DDR) in complex connection with organized crime' is given. Ms Skroch revered to economy, public administration and the sex trade business. There has actually been leads 'that from people within the organized crime, consciously and purposefully situations were set up to blackmail individuals, partially in conjunction with bribery and corruption'. The goal of these proceedings was to bring certain groups like staffers, public officials, politicians and other representatives of public life into 'dependencies'. Yet in March 2013, she still faced disciplinary and judicial inquiry. On 2 July 2014, the political parties of SPD, Greens and the Left proclaimed their findings on the 'Saxonyswamp'.They stated that there was no viable evidence for the existence 'of a corrupt network'. However, they complained that the government had not seriously run the enlightenment of the affair, but had even prevented it. In the process several employees were affected and were 'downright destroyed in their professional and social status'.|$|R
