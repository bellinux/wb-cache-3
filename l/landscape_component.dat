5000|$|Landscapes {{took up a}} more {{important}} part of the artist's activity from 1590 onwards. His landscape compositions combine the Nordic tradition of landscape paintings with Venetian pictorial plots. His brushwork is loose and less descriptive than Flemish landscapes from the same time. His palette is decidedly Venetian, with mainly warm colours, dominated by brown, red and pink. An example is the [...] (Pinacoteca Civica, Vicenza). While the <b>landscape</b> <b>component</b> is prevalent in this composition there is a narrative element with nymphs fishing and figures darting from the foreground to the background. The canvas dates from the later period of the painter's career when he often reflected on the themes of hunting and fishing activities. The theme of the composition may also be an allegory of water. The exuberance of the nature portrayed with great precision shows his Flemish training. The Flemish character is tempered by obvious Venetian influences, and in particular that of Tintoretto, reflected in the perspective view and the sudden movement of protagonists, highlighted by light touches and light strokes.|$|E
40|$|The human {{perception}} and valuation of landscapes {{is a complex}} process but has been pragmatically advanced through public participation GIS (PPGIS). PPGIS methods {{have the capacity to}} generate spatial data to empirically examine relationships between human landscape values and physical landscape character. In 2011, PPGIS methods were used to identify a range of social landscape values for two regions in southern New Zealand, Otago and Southland. Seven of these landscape values were analysed to identify significant relationships with physical landscape character from the New Zealand Landscape Classification system. In this paper we examine methods to extrapolate landscape values from this regional data set to a national level using these landscape value and character relationships. In the absence of empirical value data at a national level, we examine two quantitative approaches for extrapolating landscape values: (1) <b>landscape</b> <b>component</b> weights based on the percentage of value counts found within landscape components, and (2) <b>landscape</b> <b>component</b> weights based on the ratio of landscape values to the landscape area. We prepare and present maps of seven landscape values for the entire country of New Zealand to demonstrate the method. We conclude that landscape value extrapolation can assist impact assessment for land use change but should be kept simple for decision support...|$|E

40|$|Neighborhood {{satisfaction}} {{is an important}} component of life satisfaction. As a contributor to life satisfaction, neighborhood {{satisfaction is}} influenced by individual and household background variables. However, there is limited understanding of how physical environments influence neighborhood satisfaction. This paper examines the effect of <b>landscape</b> <b>components</b> (structures, pavement, trees) and land use (residential, commercial, and open space) on neighborhood satisfaction. A survey of 276 respondents in College Station, Texas, was georeferenced and analyzed with <b>landscape</b> <b>components</b> and land-use GIS data. A structural equation model (SEM) examines the relationships among background variables, land use, <b>landscape</b> <b>components,</b> and neighborhood satisfaction simultaneously. <b>Landscape</b> <b>components</b> and land use were both found {{to play an important role}} in neighborhood satisfaction. Trees were found to have a positive effect on neighborhood satisfaction while structures were negative. Pavement, when commercial land use and structures in the SEM model were accounted for, shows a positive relationship with neighborhood satisfaction, suggesting that not all pavement is seen as undesirable. Commercial land use was also found to have a negative effect on neighborhood satisfaction, while background variables have no significant impact. The amount and arrangement of land uses and <b>landscape</b> <b>components</b> in neighborhoods may improve the well-being of residents by increasing their neighborhood satisfaction. ...|$|R
40|$|Like other pond-breeding amphibians, the {{natterjack}} toad (Bufo calamita) typically {{presents a}} patchy distribution. Because the species experiences high probabilities of local population extinction, its persistence within landscapes relies on {{both local and}} landscape-scale processes [dispersal allowing the (re) colonization of habitat patches]. However, the structure and composition of the matrix surrounding local populations can alter the dispersal rates between populations. As shown previously (Landscape Ecol 19 : 829 - 842, 2004), the locomotor performances of individuals at the dispersal stage depend {{on the nature of}} the <b>component</b> crossed: some <b>landscape</b> <b>components</b> offer high resistance to movement (high resistance or high viscosity components) whereas others allow high efficiency of movement (low resistance components). We now examine the ability of individuals to discriminate between <b>landscape</b> <b>components</b> and select low-resistance components. Our experimental study investigates the ways in which young natterjack toads choose from among <b>landscape</b> <b>components</b> common to southern Belgium. Toadlets (the dispersal stage) were experimentally confronted with boundaries between surrogates of sandy soils, roads, forests, agricultural fields and intensive pastures. Our results show: 1 the ability of toadlets to react to boundaries between <b>landscape</b> <b>components,</b> 2 differences in permeability among boundaries, and 3 our inability to predict correctly the permeability of the boundaries from the patch-specific resistance assessed previously. Toadlets showed a preference for bare environments and forests, whereas they avoided the use of agricultural environments. This pattern could not be explained in terms of patch-specific resistance only, and is discussed in terms of mortality risks and resource availability in the various <b>landscape</b> <b>components,</b> with particular attention to repercussions on conservation strategies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{concept of}} {{distributed}} hydrological models {{is based on}} the integration of <b>landscape</b> <b>components</b> to delineate distributed process entities. These Hydrological Response Units (HRU) are topologically connected model entities and represent areas of homogeneous topographic and physiographic environment and therewith the hydrological system response. The HRU regionalisation concept is realised by the intersection of landscape parameters such as topography, land use, soils and geology. In many river catchments of the world most of these required data are only available on a coarse spatial resolution or poor quality. Furthermore, there is often a lack of data for discharge and precipitation. The demand for involving these catchments in planning of water management has determined the goals of the research program Prediction in Ungauged Basins (PUB) by the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS). The availability of new remote sensing products provides the opportunity to by-pass these data gaps and offers a GIS-database for regionalisation of river catchments based on HRUs. Topography {{is one of the most}} important factors for runoff and it is influencing the evolution of other <b>landscape</b> <b>components</b> such as soil catena or land cover patterns. The assumption of a strong, process-driven feedback between the topography and further <b>landscape</b> <b>components</b> as well as runoff dynamics lead us to a modified delineation of process entities by a topographic oriented HRU approach on the base of the globall...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores which {{physical}} <b>landscape</b> <b>components</b> {{relate to}} subjective landscape dimensions. The {{ways in which}} people describe their surrounding cultural landscape was analyzed through an assessment of their representations of it. A special focus was placed on assessing the role of land cover {{as a means to}} communicate landscape meanings regarding a specific geographical region. The methodological framework was built {{on the basis of a}} questionnaire survey, multivariate statistical analysis and mapping approaches. This research shows that there is a set of physical <b>landscape</b> <b>components</b> that relate to subjective landscape dimensions which can be disclosed through the assessment of social representations. Enhancing and safeguarding those physical <b>landscape</b> <b>components</b> associated with the subjective landscape dimensions are important aspects in both framing and targeting land cover/use policies and decision making. Results also suggest that land cover can be understood as an important asset for describing landscapes as more than 30 % of respondents referred to it when asked to represent the case study region of Alentejo in southern Portugal. This might mean that in addition to objective ecological and biological functions, land cover is also an important asset for evaluating subjective landscape dimensions in line with place attachment and landscape identity. Finally, the ways in which the empirical material gathered here can be used to inform policy and planning are explored...|$|R

In this study, we aimed to improve discrimination and characterization of the Brazilian cerrado physiognomies using hyperspectral Hyperion imagery, the first space-borne imaging spectrometer onboard the NASA's Earth Observing- 1 (EO- 1) platform. A Hyperion image was acquired over the Brasilia National Park (BNP) on July 20, 2001. Various optical measures which took a full advantage of hyperspectral remote sensing were employed and applied to the atmospherically-corrected Hyperion data. These included the 1 st-order derivative-based green vegetation index (1 st-DGVI), ligno-cellulose absorption index, spectral albedo, and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) spectral unmixing. All these optical measures were correlated well with field-estimates of <b>landscape</b> <b>component</b> cover fractions. Especially, the SWIR spectral unmixing results simultaneously biophysically-characterized and discriminated the cerrado physiognomies.

However, growing {{evidence shows that}} species-environmentrelationshipsvary in space and time. In this study, we assessed to what extent bird responses tolandscape components can be geographically generalised and whether differences inresponse generality {{can be explained by}} traits. Location: France. Methods: We collected a large bird data set (1968 point counts over two years) witha standardised protocol in three agricultural regions with different levels of intensificationin France. We modelled the relationships between the distribution of 26 birdspecies and three <b>landscape</b> <b>components</b> (percentage of woodland, hedgerow densityand landscape heterogeneity) and assessed whether differences between regions inbird responses to <b>landscape</b> <b>components</b> (i. e., landscape-regioninteractions) can beexplained by three species traits (habitat specialisation, diet and migration strategy). We also examined the response of total species richness. Results: We found that 16 species showed regional differences in their response atleast for one of the three landscape variables. Importance of landscape-regioninteractionswas significantly correlated with two species traits. Responses of specialist speciesto <b>landscape</b> <b>components</b> were geographically more constant than those ofgeneralists. The geographical variability of responses was higher for migrants than forsedentary species. There were no significant relationships for the diet trait.

40|$|The {{aesthetic}} {{beauty of}} a landscape is a very subjective issue: every person has their own opinions and their own idea of what beauty is. However, all people have a common evolutionary history, and, according to the Biophilia hypothesis, a genetic predisposition to liking certain types of landscapes. It is possible that this common inheritance allows us to attempt to model scenic preference for natural landscapes. The ideal type of model for such predictions is the psychophysical preference model, integrating psychological responses to landscapes with objective measurements of quantitative and qualitative landscape variables. Such models commonly predict {{two thirds of the}} variance in the predications of the general public for natural landscapes. In order to create such a model three sets of data were required: landscape photographs (surrogates of the actual landscape), landscape preference data and <b>landscape</b> <b>component</b> variable measurements. The Internet was used to run a questionnaire survey; a novel, yet flexible, environmentally friendly and simple method of data gathering, resulting in one hundred and eighty responses. A geographic information system was used to digitise ninety landscape photographs and measure their landforms (based on elevation) in terms of areas and perimeters, their colours and proxies for their complexity and coherence. Landscape preference models were created by running multiple linear regressions using normalised preference data and the <b>landscape</b> <b>component</b> variables, including mathematical transformations of these variables. The eight models created predicted over sixty percent of variance in the responses and had moderate to high correlations with a second set of landscape preference data. A common base to the models were the variables of complexity, water and mountain landform, in particular the presence or absence of water and mountains was noted as being significant in determining landscape scenic preference. In order to fully establish the utility of these models, they were further tested against: changes in weather and season; the addition of cultural structures; different photographers; alternate film types; different focal lengths; and composition. Results showed that weather and season were not significant in determining landscape preference; cultural structures increased preferences for landscapes; and photographs taken by different people did not produce consistent results from the predictive models. It was also found that film type was not significant and that changes in focal length altered preferences for landscapes. Financial assistance from The Human Research Trust...|$|E

In contrast, the trees and the pond lowered the air temperature near ground during the daytime but produced a slight warming effect during the nighttime. The influence of vegetation on air temperature and humidity is affected by the configurations of greenery.

40|$|Loess {{deposits}} {{that are}} invariably small are scattered over southern and midland England. They can be examined within a simple, speculative geomorphological model. This allows {{the concentration of}} loess material to be predicted and explained and a distribution network relating to the whole system produced. A complex series {{of events in the}} Weald loess trap causes a concentration of loess material by rivers flowing through various gaps in the Downs. The Thames provides loessic estuarine deposits, and the Pegwell Bay loess was a feature of the R. Stour. South coast accumulations are related to rivers flowing south through Downs gaps, such as the Adur and the Arun. The geomorphological model assumes a modest loess fall (say 20 - 50 cm, derived from the northeast) over southern and midland Britain, and develops loess accumulations by logical geomorphological processes from this starting point. Palaeoclimatic studies suggest that interest in the British loess is growing; some overall sedimentological studies might be useful. Loess in Britain should be seen as a major landscape material; it is often not an obvious <b>landscape</b> <b>component</b> but it is of fundamental importance.

In this study, we extend psychophysical analysis of landscapes by examining the relationships between multiple landscape values and physical landscape character. Previous landscape research has {{tended to focus on}} the relationship between a single value such as landscape aesthetics and a single physical <b>landscape</b> <b>component,</b> such as vegetation or water. We spatially intersected eight landscape values collected through a regional public participation GIS (PPGIS) process with landscape components and classes from the New Zealand Land Classification (NZLC) system. We used chi-square residual analysis and correspondence analysis to identify significant spatial associations. The results indicate that the general public associate particular values with specific landscape components at a regional scale. Greater than expected landscape values were associated with urban areas, water features, indigenous landcover, and mountains. Fewer than expected landscape values were associated with flatter, agricultural landscapes. We discuss the benefits and limitations of these methods for landscape assessment in New Zealand, {{and in the absence of}} PPGIS data to directly measure landscape values, whether landscape components should be used to interpolate values for landscape assessment. We urge replication of the method in other regions to increase the external validity of the landscape value–physical landscape associations described herein...|$|E
