40|$|The {{enhanced}} host port interface (EHPI) on the TMS 320 VC 5509 and TMS 320 VC 5510 DSPs {{provides a}} 16 -bit port through which a host device may access {{the internal and}} external memory space of the DSP. The flexibility of the EHPI interface allows various host devices to interface with the DSP using minimal or no external interface logic. This document describes various possible EHPI configurations and explains how to properly interface the EHPI to a host device. The document also explains the proper sequence for <b>loading</b> <b>boot</b> code to the DSP via EHPI. Summaries of EHPI signal descriptions, register definitions, an...|$|E
50|$|INIT-type {{extensions}} were <b>loaded</b> at <b>boot</b> time {{to update}} the operating system. Confusingly, various other files could be placed into the Extensions folder as well, {{many of which were}} not <b>loaded</b> at <b>boot</b> time. The most notable of these were shared libraries which were commonly put into the Extensions folder for ease of location. Shared libraries were not <b>loaded</b> at <b>boot</b> time.|$|R

50|$|If {{there is}} no active partition, or the active partition's boot sector is invalid, the MBR may <b>load</b> a {{secondary}} <b>boot</b> loader which will select a partition (often via user input) and <b>load</b> its <b>boot</b> sector, which usually loads the corresponding operating system kernel. In some cases, the MBR may also attempt to <b>load</b> secondary <b>boot</b> loaders before trying to boot the active partition. If all else fails, it should issue an INT 18h BIOS interrupt call (followed by an INT 19h just in case INT 18h would return) {{in order to give}} back control to the BIOS, which would then attempt to boot off other devices, attempt a remote boot via network or invoke ROM BASIC.|$|R
50|$|As {{an active}} wrestler, Ron Wright would use weapons {{including}} a custom-made knucklebuster with a blade to legitimately cut his {{opponents in the}} ring and cause them to bleed profusely. He called this his 'chisel'. Faced with a violent assault from Wright, a young scared rookie Kevin Sullivan in what he believed was actual self-defense tried to knock out Wright in the ring with a chain to which the veteran Wright replied with laughter and congratulations. He is also known for using a <b>loaded</b> <b>boot,</b> which wrestlers like Tom Prichard and Raven would use in later years.|$|R
50|$|Some modern CPUs and {{microcontrollers}} (for example, TI OMAP) {{or sometimes}} even DSPs may have boot ROM with boot code integrated directly into their silicon, so such a processor could perform quite a sophisticated boot sequence {{on its own}} and <b>load</b> <b>boot</b> programs from various sources like NAND flash, SD or MMC card and so on. It is difficult to hardwire all the required logic for handling such devices, so an integrated boot ROM is used instead in such scenarios. Boot ROM usage enables more flexible boot sequences than hardwired logic could provide. For example, the boot ROM could try to perform boot from multiple boot sources. Also, a boot ROM is often able to <b>load</b> a <b>boot</b> loader or diagnostic program via serial interfaces like UART, SPI, USB and so on. This feature is often used for system recovery purposes when for some reasons usual boot software in non-volatile memory got erased, and {{it could also be}} used for initial non-volatile memory programming when there is clean non-volatile memory installed and hence no software available in the system yet.|$|R
50|$|Once the BIOS {{has found}} a {{bootable}} device it <b>loads</b> the <b>boot</b> sector to linear address 7C00h (usually segment:offset 0000h:7C00h, but some BIOSes erroneously use 07C0h:0000h) and transfers execution to the boot code. In {{the case of a}} hard disk, this {{is referred to as the}} Master Boot Record (MBR) and is by definition not operating-system specific. The conventional MBR code checks the MBR's partition table for a partition set as bootable (the one with active flag set). If an active partition is found, the MBR code <b>loads</b> the <b>boot</b> sector code from that partition, known as Volume Boot Record (VBR), and executes it.|$|R
5000|$|The IBM 701 {{computer}} (1952-1956) had a [...] "Load" [...] {{button that}} initiated {{reading of the}} first 36-bit word into main memory from a punched card in a card reader, a magnetic tape in a tape drive, or a magnetic drum unit, depending on {{the position of the}} Load Selector switch. The left 18-bit half-word was then executed as an instruction, which usually read additional words into memory. The <b>loaded</b> <b>boot</b> program was then executed, which, in turn, loaded a larger program from that medium into memory without further help from the human operator. The term [...] "boot" [...] has been used in this sense since at least 1958.|$|R

500|$|... iBoot {{boot loader}} on Mac OS X {{is located in}} /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi. Once the kernel and all drivers {{necessary}} for <b>booting</b> are <b>loaded,</b> the <b>boot</b> loader starts the kernelâ€™s initialization procedure. At this point, enough drivers are loaded for the kernel to find the root device.|$|R
5000|$|If the <b>loaded</b> <b>boot</b> sector {{happens to}} be a Master Boot Record (MBR), as found on {{partitioned}} media, it will relocate itself to : in memory, otherwise this step is skipped. The MBR code will scan the partition table, which is located within this sector, for an active partition (modern MBRs check if bit 7 is set at offset , whereas old MBRs simply check for a value of [...] ), and, if found, load the first sector of the corresponding partition, which holds the Volume Boot Record (VBR) of that volume, into memory at : in the similar fashion as it had been loaded by the ROM BIOS itself. The MBR will then pass execution to the loaded portion with certain registers set up.|$|R

5000|$|The BIOS {{proceeds}} to test each device sequentially until a bootable device is found, {{at which time}} the BIOS transfers control to the loaded sector with a jump instruction to its first byte at address [...] (exactly 1 KiB below the 32 KiB mark); see MBR invocation and VBR invocation. (This location is one reason that an IBM PC requires at least 32 KiB of RAM {{in order to be}} equipped with a disk system; with 31 KiB or less, {{it would be impossible to}} boot from any disk, removable or fixed, using the BIOS boot protocol.) Most, but not all, BIOSes load the drive number (as used by INT 13h) of the boot drive into CPU register DL before jumping to the first byte of the <b>loaded</b> <b>boot</b> sector.|$|R

Prichard fought in a couple of single matches against Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels. They returned to SMW and regained the SMW Tag Team Championship, marking Prichard's eighth title reign, on August 4, 1995 in Knoxville, Tennessee, defeating Tracy Smothers and Dirty White Boy at the Super Bowl of Wrestling. During the feud, The Thugs injured Prichard's leg, and he began wearing a <b>loaded</b> <b>boot,</b> which he use as a weapon to gain victories for him and Del Ray. They held the titles until the promotion folded on November 26, 1995. After SMW folded, the Heavenly Bodies briefly wrestled for Extreme Championship Wrestling, until Prichard returned to the WWF.|$|R

50|$|The BIOS {{in modern}} PCs initializes and tests the system {{hardware}} components, and <b>loads</b> a <b>boot</b> loader or an operating system from a mass memory device. In {{the era of}} MS-DOS, the BIOS provided a hardware abstraction layer for the keyboard, display, and other input/output (I/O) devices that standardized an interface to application programs and the operating system. More recent operating systems do not use the BIOS after loading, instead accessing the hardware components directly.|$|R
50|$|Novell's {{original}} NetWare {{client was}} written for DOS. Initial versions required a hard-linked protocol stack, where a separate executable would be created by the network administrator for each network card configuration on the network. This executable would be <b>loaded</b> at <b>boot</b> time, and remain resident in memory until the system was shut down. Later implementations allowed the network stack to be loaded and unloaded dynamically, using pre-existing modules. This greatly simplified maintenance of client workstations on the network.|$|R
50|$|Many boot loaders (like GNU GRUB, Windows's BOOTMGR, and Windows NT/2000/XP's NTLDR) can be {{configured}} to {{give the}} user multiple booting choices. These choices can include different operating systems (for dual or multi-booting from different partitions or drives), {{different versions of the}} same operating system (in case a new version has unexpected problems), different operating system <b>loading</b> options (e.g., <b>booting</b> into a rescue or safe mode), and some standalone programs that can function without an operating system, such as memory testers (e.g., memtest86+), a basic shell (as in GNU GRUB), or even games (see List of PC Booter games). Some boot loaders can also <b>load</b> other <b>boot</b> loaders; for example, GRUB loads BOOTMGR instead of loading Windows directly. Usually a default choice is preselected with a time delay during which a user can press a key to change the choice; after this delay, the default choice is automatically run so normal booting can occur without interaction.|$|R

50|$|A boot disk is a {{removable}} digital data storage medium {{from which a}} computer can <b>load</b> and run (<b>boot)</b> an operating system or utility program. The computer must have a built-in program which will load and execute a program from a boot disk meeting certain standards.|$|R
30|$|When {{processing}} begins, the decoder accesses address zero in the <b>boot</b> <b>loading</b> ROM {{and reads}} initialization instructions.

Upon finishing, the decoder jumps to program memory and starts processing.|$|R
50|$|In May 2001 {{the company}} {{launched}} RISC OS Select, a subscription scheme allowing users {{access to the}} latest OS updates. These upgrades are released as soft-loadable ROM images, separate to the ROM where the boot OS is stored, and are <b>loaded</b> at <b>boot</b> time. By providing soft-loads, physical ROM costs are eliminated and updates are able to be delivered with accelerated speed and frequency. It has also allowed the company to subsidise the retail price of ROM releases, which are generally a culmination {{of the last few}} Select upgrades with a few extra minor changes.|$|R
50|$|On all Old World ROM machines, once Toolbox is <b>loaded,</b> the <b>boot</b> {{procedure}} is the same. Toolbox executes a memory test, enumerates Mac OS devices it knows about (this varies from model to model), and either starts the on-board video (if present) or the option ROM on a NuBus or PCI video card. Toolbox then checks for a disk in the floppy drive, and scans all SCSI buses for a disk with a valid System Folder, giving preference to whatever disk is set as the startup disk in the parameter RAM.|$|R
