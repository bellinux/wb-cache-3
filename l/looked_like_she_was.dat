2500|$|Initially, Chibnall {{wanted to}} reveal the murderer's {{identity}} to the entire cast and crew at an all-hands meeting on the Harbour Cliffs Beach {{a few days before}} releasing the final three scripts. A short film of completed footage had been edited together to show the cast and crew how the series was coming together. It was his intent {{to reveal the}} secret {{at the end of the}} screen. The night before the meeting, the cast and crew filmed the [...] "re-creation scene" [...] where Tom Miller skateboards through Broadchurch in an attempt to jog people's memories. But some individuals approached Chibnall during the night's shoot and said they enjoyed the suspense, so Chibnall decided not to tell. Reaction by the cast was mixed to his decision. [...] "Olivia Colman, who plays one of the investigating police officers, <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ready to murder me," [...] Chibnall later joked, [...] "while David Tennant grabbed hold of me and said he couldn't believe I wasn't going to tell him. But then he admitted he was actually glad." [...] Chibnall finally told the remaining key actors who the murderer was a few days later during late-night phone calls, just hours before they were due on the set.|$|E
60|$|Oh, the dandiest {{people to}} know here! There was a lady going by, you wouldn't hardly say she was any older than Bea herself; she wore a dandy new gray suit and black pumps. She almost <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> looking over the town, too. But you couldn't tell what she thought. Bea {{would like to be}} that way--kind of quiet, so nobody would get fresh. Kind of--oh, elegant.|$|E
50|$|Another {{case that}} has been {{reported}} in July 2016 is Jenifer Sandoval of Colorado. Although <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> four years old, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> 22 years old.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2016, it was {{reported}} that Alyssa Pennington of New Mexico <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> five years old, but is 12 years old. [...] <b>She</b> <b>is</b> another Syndrome X case.|$|R
5000|$|Footage {{from this}} episode was later re-used in [...] "My Urologist", with Dr. Kim Briggs {{digitally}} worked into {{it to make}} it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> there on J.D.'s first day.|$|R
60|$|Cécile Renault {{was a young}} {{seamstress}} who {{was found}} one evening {{at the door of}} Robespierre's lodging, calling out in a state of exaltation that she would fain see what a tyrant <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> arrested, and upon her were found two little knives used for the purposes of her trade. That she should be arrested and imprisoned was natural enough. The times were charged with deadly fire. People had not forgotten that Marat had been murdered in his own house. Only a few days before Cécile Renault's visit to Robespierre, an assassin had fired a pistol at Collot d'Herbois on the staircase of his apartment. We may make allowance for the excitement of the hour, and Robespierre had as much right to play the martyr, as had Lewis the Fifteenth after the incident of Damiens' rusty pen-knife. But the histrionic exigencies of the chief of a faction ought not to be pushed too far. And it was a monstrous crime that because Robespierre found it convenient to pose as sacrificial victim at the Club, therefore he should have had no scruple in seeing not only the wretched Cécile, but her father, her aunt, and one of her brothers, all despatched to the guillotine in the red shirt of parricide, as agents of Pitt and Coburg, and assassins of the father of the land. This was exactly two days after he had shown his decisive power in the affair of the religious illuminists. The only possible conclusion open to a plain man after weighing and putting aside all the sophisms with which this affair has been obscured, is that Robespierre interfered in the one case because its further prosecution would have tended to make him ridiculous, and he did not interfere in the other, because the more exaggerated, the more melodramatic, the more murderous it was made, the more interesting an object would he seem in the eyes of his adorers.|$|E
5000|$|About {{four hours}} later at 1:30 am, she was found naked, gagged, tied up, and covered in mud and blood. Meili was {{discovered}} in a shallow ravine in a wooded area of the park about 300 ft north of the 102nd Street Transverse. The first policeman who saw her said: [...] "She was beaten as badly as anybody I've ever seen beaten. She <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> tortured." ...|$|E
50|$|Ariphron, a Sicyonian artist {{from the}} 4th century BC wrote a {{well-known}} hymn celebrating her. Statues of Hygieia {{were created by}} Scopas, Bryaxis and Timotheus, among others, {{but there is no}} clear description of what they <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> often depicted as a young woman feeding a large snake that was wrapped around her body or drinking from a jar that she carried. These attributes were later adopted by the Gallo-Roman healing goddess, Sirona. Hygieia was accompanied by her brother, Telesphorus.|$|E
6000|$|... "Came away {{between two}} days, I'll bet," [...] said Watson. [...] "And as fer the woman, why should her mail come under another name from his? Does that <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> his daughter?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Wise and Sid Rogell {{had first}} thought of Joan Blondell to play Julie, {{following}} her performance as Zeena Krumbein in Nightmare Alley, but RKO owner Howard Hughes refused, saying [...] "Blondell <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{shot out of}} the wrong end of a cannon now".|$|R
50|$|At the Dutch championships long {{distances}} 2010 Voorhuis skated 3 distances. On the 3000 meters she was 6th, at the 1500 meters she was 5th. But she didn't {{qualify for the}} World Cup 2010/2011 because of the protection over Margot Boer. At the 5000 meters it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going to win, but she was disqualified for crossing {{the line at the}} straight side. The KNSB selected her for the World Cup anyway. She also got to skate the 3000 meters, because Marrit Leenstra canceled.|$|E
5000|$|Ashmawy is 'best {{known for}} his antics' on the popular RTÉ Two travel show, How Low Can You Go? where he {{appeared}} with co-presenters Mark O'Neill and Michael Hayes. In remarking on his experiences with that show, Ashmawy said that he loved Las Vegas where he received a lap dance from (as he describes) 'a former hooker who <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in her late 50s' and said of his experiences {{on the set of}} a porn movie in California that 'We saw things there that will be in our minds for a very long time.' ...|$|E
5000|$|When Greta Garbo {{first came}} to Hollywood in 1926, she didn't speak much English. Publicist Don Gillum {{arranged}} a publicity stunt at the Farm where the actress was to be photographed cuddling lion cubs, and in a stunt cage so it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sitting with Numa. Although Gillum told her what she would be doing, Garbo didn't recognize the word lion, and so didn't realize what was in store for her until she was almost in the cage, at which point she shrieked [...] "Oh! Dos terrible animals!" [...] But {{she was a good}} sport and posed for the pictures.|$|E
5000|$|Carbon Monoxide - Heaters: Introduced around 1992-4, a {{young girl}} comes home from a night out with friends and turns on her space heater before going to bed. By morning, it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{sleeping}} but a close up reveals that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in fact dead.|$|R
50|$|A {{young girl}} gets a flat tire, {{and ends up}} with her car being stolen. Later, her car is {{involved}} in an accident which results in a man's death. The gangsters who stole the car plant the body in her car to make it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> at fault.|$|R
50|$|Alane Shriver: Alane is {{suffering}} from a diseased called progeria, which ages her very quickly. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in her seventies when <b>she</b> <b>is</b> only in the sixth grade. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> very brave, outgoing, and mature for her age. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> also looking for a friend that she can’t find.|$|R
5000|$|Jessica Riehl, {{the retired}} RCMP constable {{who was the}} last person known to have seen Yoshikubo, {{recalled}} how she had considered asking her if she needed any help. As I drove past her, I thought it might not be the best idea for her being alone." [...] She had considered turning around and going back to offer help, but decided against it. [...] "I thought, it was only 11:30 a.m., she'll be OK ... She <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sightseeing and it was close to zero, it wasn't freezing cold, and her pink coat was knee-length and she had on mitts and a hat—she was dressed for that temperature.|$|E
5000|$|At judging, {{the prizes}} include an 8-page {{editorial}} spread in Cleo, a CoverGirl cosmetics contract, and New Zealand representation with Sara’s own agency, 62 Models. The prize {{also includes a}} trip to Sydney and New York to meet with top agencies there.The judges love Teryl-Leigh's photo because of her strength and confidence and Christobelle is praised for her variety of poses.Tiffany struggled as the photographer said [...] "it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> working a strippers pole..."Teryl-Leigh gets the first call out; Hosanna and Tiffany {{end up in the}} bottom two. Hosanna's dedication is coming across as desperation and Tiffany's attitude is just too much. Hosanna is given a second chance and Tiffany was the first girl eliminated.|$|E
5000|$|Paula Abdul pre-taped a {{performance}} that aired during the pre-game show for Super Bowl XLII.Abdul performed a dance routine with several back-up dancers while Jackson played bass guitar with the band. Although she lip-synced, the performance {{still managed to}} receive some favorable reviews. A reviewer from MTV wrote, [...] "sure, her pre-game performance of 'Dance Like There's No Tomorrow' was pretaped. And yes, it certainly <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> lip-syncing Cotillard-style. But I have to admit, I thought she nailed it." [...] Another MTV review was less kind: [...] "The painfully '80s Janet Jackson rip-off tune and skinny-tie-era backup dancers made Adbul [...] look like the Mrs. Robinson of dance pop. Judging those kids on 'Idol' just got a lot harder." ...|$|E
50|$|Ragini manipulates Sanskaar and Laksh's mothers against Swara {{by making}} it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> two timing their sons.

He {{eventually}} goes to jail.|$|R
5000|$|In France, {{calling a}} young woman [...] "Mademoiselle" [...] is usually {{considered}} more polite, and calling a middle-aged woman [...] "Mademoiselle" [...] can {{be a way to}} tell her that <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in her twenties and may therefore be considered flattering. In Quebec, on the other hand, this usage may be considered offensive.|$|R
5000|$|The {{keeper of}} the Sidhe's records, the Ban of Hours is very {{powerful}} but is also fond of humans and of Earth. No one who sees her can remember what <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> Tonn's daughter, sister of Elme, and she [...] "stayed by Tonn when Elme defied him", although now she covertly opposes Tarax and the Maln.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} Top Model hopefuls {{were off}} to their photo shoot challenge with Helen Pipins, photographer - Calvin French, and some gorgeous male models. The theme throughout the shoot was Amerindian influenced and French made sure to intimidate the girls to evoke the indigenous people of the Caribbean. At deliberation, the competition was tough as Wendy commented that everyone had made considerable growth in the competition. However, only five of the finalists could continue on to compete to be on top. The judges chose Trudy-Lee as the best photo {{of the week and}} Sedia and Stephany were the bottom two. For Sedia, the judges felt that there was inconsistency in her images and in Stephany's case, there was a consensus that it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> trying too hard to pose in her photos. Sedia was eliminated and left everyone with a final bow and good-bye.|$|E
5000|$|An Allied patrol plane radioed {{a message}} to the {{division}} noting that a surfaced Japanese submarine - later determined to be I-46 - was south of Pacijan Island, heading for Ormoc Bay.The division reversed course to intercept; and, at 01:27, Wallers radar picked up the target just off the northeast coast of Ponson Island. Firing all batteries that would bear, the destroyer steamed directly for the submarine - passing the word to [...] "stand by to ram." [...] Countermanding this order at the last minute because the submarine <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> already severely damaged, Waller instead continued to pump 40-millimeter and 5 inch shellfire into the enemy submersible which attempted a weak and ineffective return fire with her deck guns. At 01:45, as Waller doubled back for a second pass, the submarines bow rose up towards the sky; and she sank, stern first.|$|E
5000|$|As {{they avoid}} Amanda, {{who seem to}} have jumped on the {{jumpsuit}} trend thanks to Wili, Betty and Matt talk about the get-together at the Suarezes, then comment on Betty's glow as she visualizes a future with Matt as Mrs. Suarez-Hartley. During the entire day, Betty still feels queasy and as she arrives to the bus stop, a waiting passenger notices Betty and gives her a seat because he thought that Betty <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> expecting and as the flashbacks come into the picture, her vision of her future changed completely as she sees a mirror image of herself as a pregnant woman. At the drug store, Betty asks for the Be-Shure pregnancy test kit from a pharmacist named Jean, without mentioning the name. Unfortunately, Hilda also shows up asking Jean for the same kit, but the siblings don't see each other even though the two do see Ignacio shopping and try their best to avoid him like the plague.|$|E

40|$|Feldkamp siblings: from left, Reuben, Viola (Burmeister), and Aaron. Front of {{photo is}} stamped with "Waterman" photo studio. Since Viola <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> 3 or 4 years old, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> born March 24, 1892, {{the photo was}} {{probably}} taken around 1895 or 96.

5000|$|At {{the judging}} panel, Jodilly, Josephine and Nicole were {{acclaimed}} by the judges, securing {{the top three}} spots, giving Josephine her fourth non-consecutive top three appearance, a feat held by Sheena as well. Marie and Sneha showed improvement and received mixed reactions from the panel. Jodilly and Josephine both gave romantic shots, with Josephine slightly off the concept as {{she seemed to have}} paid more attention to the male models on her photo than to the car, which should have been the major point of the shoot. Tia and Janice were critiqued for appearing lost and consistently delivering nothing through their shots. Tia delivered too much [...] "ego", while Janice's 'pull-my-hair' poses were awkward, despite her swagger. Last week's best photo winner Natalie, who was slowly improving, seemed to have taken a step back as she <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> staggering in pain on her photo. Generally, all the girls showed some improvement.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dress was}} {{auctioned}} on 11 June 2010, {{with an estimated}} price of between $150,000 and $250,000 and described as [...] "the most important film costume to ever come to auction". At the end the dress sold for $310,000. However, according to some people, the dress sold at auction was not the original one worn by Marilyn Monroe. Some have claimed that the dress worn by the actress in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was lined inside with felt, to remain rigid during the choreography, not the one sold at auction. William Travilla, quoted in Dressing Marilyn by Andrew Hansford, stated that [...] "Apart from the two side seams, the dress was folded into shape rather like cardboard. Any other girl would have <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> wearing cardboard, but on screen I swear {{you would have thought}} Marilyn had on a pale, thin piece of silk. Her body was so fabulous it still came through." ...|$|E
5000|$|Laila is a half-angel who {{was taken}} to the {{celestial}} world to become an angel trainee under Nanael's supervision (much to the despair of those around). However, she was not pushed around by Nanael's whims because of her [...] "my pace" [...] nature (doing things in her own pace), and it actually <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the one in control. Despite this, they get along well. Nanael, who went on a rampage, ordered Laila to clean the chaos on the human world with the [...] "Divine Punishment" [...] using Holy Milk. Because she is not a true angel, Laila must wear the sacred tool [...] "Nephilim's Wings" [...] (Nefirimu no Hane), an artificial wing, to fly, and she is armed with the Heavenly Rifle which fires Holy Milk. At first Laila looks very cool-headed, but she makes so many mistakes that she might actually be very dumb. She has the power to grow in size up to a giant form, that she uses to stop the fortress Bligh when the Rebel Army tries to attack Gainos.|$|E
50|$|Conchita Kubekik - A strange {{woman with}} a disease that caused her face to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> just a teenager, {{when the rest of}} her body was old and fragile. Unable to accept her appearance, she became {{severely}} depressed and attempted suicide several times. In the Skylight hotel, she met Raimi and befriended him. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> an Ayuamarcan. Conchita was referenced in 'Hell's Horizon' and made a minor appearance in 'City of the Snakes'.|$|R
5000|$|Hilary Lloyd's work {{is derived}} from her {{observation}} of people, objects, and spaces. All of her work illustrates her motif as isolated. Sometimes her compositions seem {{as if they were}} posed, and some of her other works <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> at a great distance observing and recording. Her work is entangled with the idea of repetitive movement and minimal materiality. The equipment that has been used to display her images include: ...|$|R

As the Blue Djinn, Ayesha serves as the {{arbitrator}} of djinn disputes and is considered [...] "beyond" [...] good and evil. Her state of mind is not achieved naturally; she uses the tree of logic (the [...] "third tree of Eden") to become a hard-hearted being.|$|R
