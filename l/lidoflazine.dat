Eighteen mongrel dogs were allocated to three groups: placebo (n = 6), <b>lidoflazine</b> (1 mg/kg) (n = 6), and <b>lidoflazine</b> (1 mg/kg) plus the adenosine receptor blocker aminophylline (7 mg/kg) (n = 6). Pretreatment was performed intravenously during 15 minutes before extracorporeal circulation. All hearts {{were subjected to}} four intervals of 15 minutes of global ischemia each followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion. After weaning from extracorporeal circulation, functional recovery was followed for 1 hour. In the <b>lidoflazine</b> group, myocardial adenosine content (0. 25 +/- 0. 06 mumol/gm dry weight) was 3. 5 times higher than that {{in the control group}} (0. 07 +/- 0. 03 mumol/gm dry weight; p < 0. 05) {{at the end of the}} last aortic crossclamping. The release of adenosine from the myocardium during each reperfusion period was significantly higher than that in the control group (p < 0. 05). Myocardial extraction of lactate was normalized at every reperfusion interval in the <b>lidoflazine</b> group but not in the control group (p < 0. 05). In the <b>lidoflazine</b> group functional recovery was significantly better than that in the control group.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} the nucleoside transport inhibitor, <b>lidoflazine,</b> at a dose of 1 mg/kg, on left ventricular function. DESIGN: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either <b>lidoflazine</b> or saline in a double-blind manner. SETTING: A university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The study was performed in 32 patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Left ventricular pressures were measured with fluid-filled catheters. Data were digitally recorded during pressure elevation induced by tilt-up of the legs. Transgastric short-axis echocardiographic views of the left ventricle were simultaneously recorded on videotape. Systolic function was evaluated with the slope (Ees, mmHg/mL) of the systolic pressure-volume relationship. Diastolic function was evaluated with the chamber stiffness constant (Kc, mmHg/mL) of the diastolic pressure-volume relationship. Cardiac function was assessed at baseline and after administration of either <b>lidoflazine</b> (group A [n = 16]) or placebo (group B [n = 16]). Data were compared using two-factor analysis of variance. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At baseline, diastolic and systolic function were comparable in both groups. <b>Lidoflazine</b> increased Kc from 0. 079 +/- 0. 015 to 0. 125 +/- 0. 017 mmHg/mL and decreased Ees from 2. 481 +/- 0. 213 to 1. 217 +/- 0. 211 mmHg/mL (p = 0. 009 and p = 0. 004, respectively).

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{pretreatment}} of the myocardium with a pharmacological agent protecting the cell against ischemic and reperfusion injury is very attractive. <b>Lidoflazine,</b> a calcium overload blocker, predominantly membrane stabilizing, {{is able to}} prevent cell damage during ischemic arrest and reperfusion. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether the combination of <b>lidoflazine</b> pretreatment and St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegia can provide, in clinical practice, better myocardial protection in aorto-coronary bypass grafting than St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegia alone. As indices for myocardial protection, recovery of cardiac function, enzyme release, and clinical outcome were registered. Ninety-three patients undergoing aorto-coronary bypass surgery were studied. These patients were randomized into two groups in a double blind fashion. Patients in group A (n = 48) received <b>lidoflazine</b> 1 mg/kg intravenously over a period of 20 min before initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Group B (n = 45) receiving placebo, acted as a control group. Myocardial protection consisted of intermittent infusion of cold 4 degrees C St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegia, topical slush ice, and systemic hypothermia (28 degrees C rectal). No significant differences between the two groups were noted in terms of recovery of cardiac function, enzyme release, incidence of myocardial infarction, low cardiac output, rhythm, and conduction disturbances.

The effect of ryanodine was also studied in guinea-pig Langendorff hearts. In addition, in rat and guinea-pig papillary muscles the effect of these drugs on the force of contraction was examined. With the exception of ryanodine and TMB- 8 all calcium antagonists induced a pronounced coronary vasodilator effect. The rank order of potency for this effect was: nifedipine > verapamil = dilitiazem = bepridil = <b>lidoflazine</b> in the presence of 0. 9 mmol/l calcium. At a calcium concentration of 1. 8 mmol/l nifedipine and verapamil proved more potent, whereas diltiazem was less active. All calcium antagonists completely suppressed the development of the left ventricular pressure. At a calcium concentration of 0. 9 mmol/l the potency order for this effect was: ryanodine > nifedipine = verapamil > diltiazem = bepridil = <b>lidoflazine</b> > TMB- 8. In the presence of 1. 8 mmol/l calcium the concentration-response curves for reduction of the left ventricular pressure by nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem slightly shifted to the right. In contrast to all calcium antagonists investigated, in guinea-pig Langendorff hearts ryanodine only partially decreased the left ventricular pressure. In rat papillary muscles ryanodine nearly completely reduced the force of contraction, whereas nifedipine only partially inhibited the force of contraction. <b>Lidoflazine</b> only slightly affected the force of contraction. In guinea-pig papillary muscles all drugs partially decreased the force of contraction. <b>Lidoflazine,</b> however, was more effective than in rat papillary muscles.

The results of the present study suggest that in the rat heart extracellular calcium plays a major role in the maintenance of the coronary vascular tone. The development of contractile force relies on the release of activator calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum but also requires the influx of calcium through dihydropyrine-sensitive channels.

These compounds also inhibited formycin B efflux with a similar potency to that of adenosine influx. NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transport was associated with high affinity binding of NBMPR (apparent K-d similar to 1 nM; 9. 6 x 10 (5) sites/cell). Specific binding of NBMPR was also inhibited by <b>lidoflazine</b> and its analogues. Mioflazine and soluflazine were 20 - 30 -fold more potent at inhibiting NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside influx in guinea-pig erythrocytes than ventricular myocytes, indicating that the potency of some of the compounds studied is tissue dependent...|$|E
40|$|The cardioprotective {{effects of}} nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem, bepridil, CERM 11956, <b>lidoflazine,</b> {{mioflazine}} and the coronary vasodilator dipyridamole were evaluated in the guinea-pig working heart {{with respect to}} cardiac function and high energy phosphate content after 45 min of global ischaemia and 25 min of reperfusion. All drugs, {{with the exception of}} dipyridamole, induced a negative inotropic effect, which resulted in a decrease of the aortic pressure (AoP), of its first derivative dAoP/dt and the cardiac output. To compare the anti-ischaemic effect of the calcium antagonists, concentrations were selected that reduced the dAoP/dt by 10 % (EC 10) and 30 % (EC 30), respectively. With the exception of nifedipine at the EC 10 and bepridil and CERM 11956 at the EC 30, perfusion with the calcium antagonists and dipyridamole (3 mumol/l) improved the recovery of contractile function after global ischaemia and reperfusion to a value between 60 and 80 % of the controls in normoxic hearts. Pretreatment with nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem, <b>lidoflazine</b> and mioflazine, but not with bepridil, CERM 11956 and dipyridamole led to slightly increased ATP levels in ischaemic hearts as compared to the control value in ischaemic hearts. After subsequent reperfusion for 25 min, for all drugs, ATP levels were further enhanced to 50 % of the level in normoxic hearts; phosphocreatine levels reached normoxic values. In particular at the EC 30, the effects of calcium antagonists on cardiac function varied in accordance with their known pharmacological and physiological profile. However, there appeared to exist no direct relationship between their beneficial effects on contractile activity and those on the levels of high energy phosphates after ischaemia and reperfusio...|$|E
40|$|Various {{kinds of}} dysrhythmias {{are found in}} {{association}} with hyperthyroidism but especially atrial fibrillation. The causal relationship of chronic atrial fibrillation and the endocrine disorder is controversial, as is its therapeutic management. Six patients with this particular combination of disorders were treated with lidoflazine: a new anti-anginal drug with anti-arrhythmic activity. All six patients returned to sinus rhythm on <b>lidoflazine</b> treatment although still hyperthyroid and remained in sinus rhythm during the follow up period ranging from 5 to 14 months. This occurred independently of antithyroid treatment. Some evidence is put forward that dysrhythmias and most commonly chronic atrial fibrillation are triggered off by hyperthyroidism or other disorders but that they are maintained by permanent cardiac damage due to arteriosclerosis, hypertension, coronary heart disease or rheumatic valve disease...|$|E
40|$|Inasmuch as the cytoplasmic {{level of}} {{activator}} Ca 2 + governs the contractile activity of vascular smooth muscle cells, {{the efficacy of}} calcium entry blockers in curtailing vasoconstriction {{is determined by the}} dependency of this level on the influx of extracellular Ca 2 + into the cells; this dependency varies with the trigger to contraction {{as well as with the}} anatomical origin of the vascular preparation tested. Certain calcium entry blockers (e. g. flunarizine and <b>lidoflazine)</b> tested in experimental conditions triggering the influx of the activator ion exhibit a pronounced tissue selectivity, presumably because the characteristics and accessibility of the Ca 2 + channels vary among different vascular smooth muscle cells. The time of onset and duration of calcium entry blockade are not identical for all calcium entry blockers, which must reflect their permeation in the tissue as well as their individual pharmacological properties at the molecular level. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the synthesis of}} the title compound 7 and its conversion into 2, 7 -substituted octahydro- 2 H-pyrido[1, 2 -a]pyrazines, i. e., bicyclic analogues of the monocyclic piperazine drug <b>lidoflazine.</b> The synthesis of 7 {{is based on a}} 3 -fold amino substitution of methyl 6 -chlor- 5 -oxohexanoate (12), initiated by displacement of chlorine with N-benzyl-N'-trityl- 1, 2 -ethanediamine. The required trielectrophile 12 was prepared readily from commercially available diethyl 2 -acetyl-glutarate. The 7 -position of compound 7 was functionalized through reaction of the lactam anion with benzophenone electrophiles. Further elaboration into the target compounds 8 - 10 involved dehydration, reduction of the lactam group, and different modes of N-debenzylation. Conformational aspects for lactam compounds 17 and 18 and the modes of ring fusion for the diastereomeric amines 9 and 10 were examined by using proton NMR and infrared spectroscopy. status: publishe...|$|E

Systemic and coronary hemodynamic and metabolic effects of {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} (NAD) before and after <b>lidoflazine</b> were studied {{in a group of}} dogs. ResUlts showed that NAD is a potent peripheral and coronary vasodilator. After lidofiazine, similar coronary and systemic effects were obtained with % to o the dose of NM) used before lidofiazine. An in vitro NM) -sparing effect of lidofiazine, in whole blood, was examined in order to clarify the mechanism of this enhancement. Lidofiazine did not influence the rate of disappearance of exogenous NM) added to blood. The mechanism of this enhancement has not been elucidated in this study. Nicotinamide adeni. ne dinucleotide (NM)) is a naturally occurring substance with vasoactive properties (von Euler et at., 1940; Gard, 1931; Hashimoto et at., 1964; Utonishi, 1958).

40|$|Drug-induced QT {{interval}} prolongation {{is one of}} {{the most}} common reasons for the withdrawal of drugs from the market. In the past decade, at least nine drugs, i. e. terfenadine, astemizole, grepafloxacin, terodiline, droperidol, <b>lidoflazine,</b> sertindole, levomethadyl and cisapride, have been removed from the market or their use has been severely restricted because of drug-induced QT interval prolongation. Therefore, this irregularity is a major safety concern in the case of drugs submitted for regulatory approval. The most common mechanism of drug-induced QT interval prolongation may be drug-related inhibition of the human ether-á-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel, which subsequently results in prolongation of the cardiac action potential duration (APD). hERGAPDbase is a database of electrophysiological experimental data documenting potential hERG channel inhibitory actions and the APD-prolongation activities of chemical compounds. All data entries are manually collected from scientific papers and curated by a person. With hERGAPDbase, we aim to provide useful information for chemical and pharmacological scientists and enable easy access to electrophysiological experimental data on chemical compounds...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} calcium channel blockers in preserving neurologic function after central nervous system ischemia, we studied three such agents in two animal models. We treated rabbits after inducing ischemia in the brain with intra-arterial microspheres and in the spinal cord using a removable aortic occluding device. We found no benefit, in terms of neurologic functional outcome, from <b>lidoflazine,</b> nimodipine, or nicardipine. All three agents elevated regional blood flow in the spinal cord. We conclude that calcium antagonists {{are not likely to}} prove beneficial if used alone in the treatment of focal central nervous system ischemia. (Stroke 1988; 19 : 1020 - 1026) Calcium channel blockers increase cerebralblood flow in humans and experimentalanimals.

40|$|Reperfusion of {{isolated}} hearts with calcium-containing solution {{after a short}} period of calcium-free perfusion results in irreversible cell damage (calcium paradox). This phenomenon is characterized by an excessive influx of calcium into the cells, the rapid onset of myocardial contracture, exhaustion of tissue high-energy phosphates, massive release of cell constituents, and extensive ultrastructural damage. The calcium paradox can be regarded as the most severe form of myocardial necrosis that can be produced experimentally. Under the experimental conditions described in this study, the calcium entry blockers verapamil, nifedipine, diltiazem and <b>lidoflazine</b> failed to reduce the massive release of enzymes that occurs in the severe form of the calcium paradox. Calcium entry blockers, however, may alter the time course of the events that occur during the development of the calcium paradox. Calcium entry blockers may have a protective effect in a mild form of the calcium paradox. This is of interest for cardiac surgery where calcium-free cardioplegic solutions are widely used. Calcium entry blockers may decrease the potential hazard of the use of these solutions...|$|E
40|$|Leishmaniasis and Chagas {{disease are}} {{neglected}} parasitic diseases endemic in developing countries; {{efforts to find}} new therapies remain a priority. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are drugs in clinical use for hypertension and other heart pathologies. Based on previous reports about the antileishmanial activity of dihydropyridine-CCBs, this work aimed to investigate whether the in vitro anti-Leishmania infantum and anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activities of this therapeutic class would be shared by other non-dihydropyridine-CCBs. Except for amrinone, our results demonstrated antiprotozoal activity for fendiline, mibefradil, and <b>lidoflazine,</b> with IC 50 values in a range between 2 and 16 [*]μM and Selectivity Index between 4 and 10. Fendiline demonstrated depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, with increased reactive oxygen species production in amlodipine and fendiline treated Leishmania, but without plasma membrane disruption. Finally, in vitro combinations of amphotericin B, miltefosine, and pentamidine against L. infantum showed in isobolograms an additive interaction when these drugs were combined with fendiline, resulting in overall mean sum of fractional inhibitory concentrations between 0. 99 and 1. 10. These data demonstrated that non-dihydropyridine-CCBs present antiprotozoal activity and could be useful candidates for future in vivo efficacy studies against Leishmaniasis and Chagas’ disease...|$|E
