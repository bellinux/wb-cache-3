5|$|An {{analysis}} {{conducted using}} X-ray fluorescence {{has found that}} the pendant was made from a highly debased gold alloy, with only 37% of the alloy consisting of gold and the remainder consisting of silver with some copper. It is likely that the gold came from melted-down coins of the Merovingian dynasty of Francia. The Frankish currency underwent a similar debasing at around this time. The link with Francia is illustrative of the trading and cultural <b>links</b> <b>that</b> existed between Anglo-Saxon England and continental Europe at the time.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Beonna's life or his reign, as nothing in written form has survived from this period of East Anglian history. The very few primary sources for Beonna consist of bare {{references}} to his accession or rule written by late chroniclers, that until quite recently were impossible to verify. Since 1980, {{a sufficient number of}} coins have been found to show that he was indeed a historical figure. They have allowed scholars to make deductions about economic and linguistic <b>links</b> <b>that</b> existed between East Anglia and other parts of both England and northern Europe during his reign, as well as aspects of his own identity and rule.|$|E

5|$|The VT heralded the fitment of {{semi-trailing}} arm independent {{rear suspension}} as standard across the range, a significant selling point over the rival Falcon, along with increased electronics such as Traction Control. However, in terms of suspension, the original Opel design was simplified by removing the toe control <b>links</b> <b>that</b> was standard equipment on the European Omega since 1987. Consequently, this afflicted the VT with excessive tyre wear due to distortions to the suspension camber angle and toe under heavy load, such as heavy towing or when travelling over undulated surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the French in the south {{threatened}} existing trade <b>links</b> <b>that</b> Carolina colonists had established into the interior, creating tension among all three powers. France and Spain, allies in this conflict, had been {{on opposite sides of}} the recently ended Nine Years' War. Conflicting territorial claims between Carolina and Florida south of the Savannah River were overlaid by animosity over religious divisions between the Roman Catholic Spanish and the Protestant English along the coast.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} episodes of Carnivàle, Ben's {{parentage}} {{is one of}} the big puzzles. As a man named Henry Scudder seems connected to everything and everyone, it is Ben's job to piece together the mystery of his own past. The progressing series indicates many characters are more closely interrelated than what both the characters and the audience would imagine at first. Although these links rarely receive plot attention, the immediate genealogy of the main characters is cleared up {{by the end of the}} second season. Other character <b>links</b> <b>that</b> were largely unanswered after Carnivàles cancellation concern the trench war and the Hyde&Teller Company in relation to the emergence of the Carnivàle. Show creator Daniel Knauf, character biographies on the HBO website and the Pitch Document later provided detail for what was originally envisioned. Although the nature of these sources does not qualify them for canon status, they provide a framework for hints dropped in the series.|$|E

5|$|When the Chetnik leaders {{appointed}} by Draža Mihailović, Majors Boško Todorović and Dangić, {{became aware of}} the commencement of Operation Southeast Croatia, they advised other Chetnik commanders that the operation was targeted at the Partisans, and {{there was no need for}} the Chetniks to get involved. Following this, their units withdrew from their positions on the front line, let the Germans pass through their areas, or went home. Many withdrew across the Drina into German-occupied Serbia to avoid being engaged, which severely weakened the Partisan defences with the result that they suffered significant casualties and lost a great deal of territory. These actions severed any remaining cooperative <b>links</b> <b>that</b> remained between the Chetniks and Partisans in eastern Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|Dwight D. Eisenhower {{was elected}} U.S. President in 1952, {{promising}} {{to take a}} harder line against communism; the <b>links</b> <b>that</b> his staff members John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles had to the UFC also predisposed them to act against the Guatemalan government. Additionally, the U.S. government drew exaggerated conclusions {{about the extent of}} communist influence from the presence of a small number of communists among Árbenz's advisers. Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas. The coup was preceded by U.S. efforts to criticize and isolate Guatemala internationally. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of psychological warfare. This included a radio station which broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion, claiming to be genuine news, as well as bombings of Guatemala City and a naval blockade of Guatemala. The invasion force fared poorly militarily, and most of its offensives were defeated. However, psychological warfare and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which eventually refused to fight. Árbenz briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on 27 June. Castillo Armas became president ten days later, following negotiations in San Salvador.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Ocean was a {{vital part}} of the chain of trade <b>links</b> <b>that</b> {{connected}} the British Empire. Merchant ships from China, Arabia and East Africa crossed it regularly and at its centre was the British-held continent of India, from which heavily laden East Indiamen brought millions of pounds worth of trade goods to Britain every year. Trade with India was vital to the financial security of Britain and consequently the trade routes across the Indian Ocean were a high priority for protection from the Royal Navy and at serious risk from French raiders. The outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, following the brief Peace of Amiens that had ended the French Revolutionary Wars, placed the Indian Ocean trade routes under threat from Dutch cruisers operating from Cape Town and the Dutch East Indies and French ships based on Isle de France and the newly renamed Île Bonaparte. By 1808, most of the Dutch colonies had been neutralised in a series of brief but successful campaigns; the Cape by Sir Home Riggs Popham in January 1806 and the Dutch island of Java by Sir Edward Pellew in a campaign that ended in December 1807. The French Indian Ocean islands were however far more defensible: heavily fortified, garrisoned by regular French soldiers and several months voyage from the nearest British port, they presented a much greater challenge to the limited British forces available in the region.|$|E
