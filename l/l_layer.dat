40|$|We {{evaluated}} the temporal {{changes in the}} vertical distribution of leaf litter respiration (RLL) due to changes of leaf lit- ter water content (WLL) within the leaf litter layer (<b>L</b> <b>layer)</b> using in situ direct measurements. To investigate the vertical distribution of RLL and WLL within the leaf litter layer over a time-series, we measured the RLL and WLL of 10 separate layers in vertical leaf litter stacks fixed to the forest floor using wire pins. Measurements were conducted for 30 stacks in a temperate broad-leaved secondary forest between May 2008 and January 2009. In the warm season, high RLL was ob- served at high WLL, while low RLL was observed at low WLL. RLL was comparatively lower during the cool season than during the warm season regardless {{of the magnitude of}} WLL. The temperature sensitivity of RLL differed depending on WLL; temperature increases under low-moisture conditions had small effects on RLL, while under higher-moisture condi- tions, RLL was more responsive to temperature increases. Small differences in position within the leaf litter stack affected the vertical variation of WLL and, consequently, there was large distribution in RLL during the wet period and small distri- bution in RLL (totally small values) during the dry period. Thus, CO 2 efflux from the net <b>L</b> <b>layer</b> was strongly affected by RLL distribution induced by the local wetting within the <b>L</b> <b>layer.</b> In estimating CO 2 efflux from the <b>L</b> <b>layer</b> using water content of the <b>L</b> <b>layer,</b> monitoring of the water content of the <b>L</b> <b>layer,</b> which takes into account the vertical distribution in WLL within the <b>L</b> <b>layer,</b> is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Fluctuations in soil biota {{abundance}} in different organic layers of a Scots pine forest in The Netherlands were studied by bimonthly counts during 2. 5 years. The counts were made using litterbags which {{were placed in}} the litter (L), fragmentation (F) and humus (H) layers {{at the start of the}} experiment. Results from the <b>L</b> <b>layer</b> were also compared with results from litter which was renewed every 2 months (L') to study colonisation. In this study the results for amoebae, flagellates and ciliates are presented. The highest numbers of soil protozoa were found in the <b>L</b> <b>layer</b> during most sampling occasions. The H layer contained the lowest numbers. The <b>L</b> <b>layer</b> also showed higher numbers than the L' litterbags which were renewed every 2 months. Fluctuations in abundance could partly be explained by fluctuations in moisture content. Moisture content in the litterbags was rather constant throughout the experiment, although occasionally moisture contents of 10 % and 80 % were observed. Fluctuations in moisture content in the <b>L</b> <b>layer</b> were often larger than in the F and H layers. Flagellates were the most abundant group, reaching numbers of several hundred thousands to several millions per gram fresh weight on various occasions.

Stratified litterbag sets were {{used to compare the}} influences of seasonality and degradation stage on the decomposition of pine litter. The variables used in monitoring the decomposition processes were weight loss, carbon and nitrogen contents and enzyme activity of the litter microflora. At each site the litterbags containing pine needles from L and F layers were randomly distributed in the L and F layers, respectively. After 1 year the weight loss in the litterbags in the upper plot was 32 % in the L and 53 % in the F layer. Weight loss in the lower plot was 60 % in the L and 42 % in the F layer. Temperature and moisture were not responsible for these differences in weight loss.

The annual leaf litter fall was 6. 6 t/ha・year on the upper slope, 5. 7 t/ha・year on the lower slope and 2. 8 t/ha・year in the valley. The amount of litter fall from deciduous trees was at maximum in October-November, while evergreen broadleaf trees showed their peak litter fall in May-June. Japanese cedars, which live in the valley preferentially, had peak leaf litter fall in November and January. Concentrations of T-N, T-P and exchangeable K in litter fall declined in the deciduous season, while Ca was increased in the deciduous season. Branch litter contained more Ca than leaf litter and other litter, which was the highest in November. The O layer standing mass had peaks in May and declined from May to November. Concentrations of T-N and T-P in the O layer showed the highest values in the valley, followed by the middle slope, with the lowest values in the upper slope.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{account for the}} {{emergence}} of human language syntax. Like many evolutionary innovations, language arose from the adventitious combination of two pre-existing, simpler systems that had been evolved for other functional tasks. The first system, Type E(xpression), is found in birdsong, where it marks territory, mating availability, and similar ‘expressive’ functions. The second system, Type L(exical), has been suggestively found in non-human primate calls and in honeybee waggle dances, where it demarcates predicates with one or more ‘arguments,’ such as combinations of calls in monkeys or compass headings set to sun position in honeybees. We show that human language syntax is composed of two layers that parallel these two independently evolved systems: an E layer resembling the Type E system of birdsong and an <b>L</b> <b>layer</b> providing words. The existence of the E and L layers can be confirmed using standard linguistic methodology.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the wetting and drying {{processes}} of the litter layer (<b>L</b> <b>layer),</b> likely because of technical difficulties inherent in nondestructive water content (WC) monitoring. We developed a method for continuously measuring the WC of leaf litter (the "LWC method") in situ using capacitance sensors. To test variants of this approach, five (for the LWC_ 5) or ten (for the LWC_ 10 method) Quercus serrata leaves were attached around capacitance sensors. The output voltage used for each LWC method was linearly correlated with the gravimetric WC (LWC_ 5 :R[2]= 0. 940; LWC_ 10 :R[2]= 0. 942), producing different slopes for each calibration line. For in situ continuous measurements of WC in the layer, two sensors were used, one placed on top of the layer and the other at the boundary between the and mineral layers. The average continuous WC of the layer was then calculated from the output voltage of the two sensors and the calibration function, and this value was linearly correlated with the gravimetric WC(R[2]= 0. 697).
