5|$|Stela 5 is {{reasonably}} well preserved and is inscribed with two Long Count dates flanked by representations of two standing figures portraying rulers. The <b>latest</b> <b>of</b> these two dates is AD126. The right-hand figure {{is holding a}} snake, while the left-hand figure is holding what is probably a jaguar.

5|$|Stela 2 is a {{monument}} {{in the early}} Maya style that is inscribed with a damaged Long Count date.

5|$|The first county {{courthouse}} {{was a small}} log building. When Corydon became the territory capital in 1813, county and territorial officials shared the building.

As more space was needed, other buildings were constructed to supplement the courthouse. In the 1920s, the <b>latest</b> <b>of</b> these office buildings was razed {{to make way for}} a new courthouse; the old building was acquired by the State of Indiana and preserved as the first state capitol building.

5|$|The work {{commenced}} {{at the end}} of {{the building}} furthest from the altar, with the <b>latest</b> <b>of</b> the narrative scenes, and progressed towards the altar with the scenes of the Creation. The first three scenes, from the story of Noah, contain a much larger number of small figures than the later panels. This is partly because of the subject matter, which deals with the fate of Humanity, but also because all the figures at that end of the ceiling, including the prophets and Ignudi, are smaller than in the central section. As the scale got larger, Michelangelo's style became broader, the final narrative scene of God in the act of Creation was painted in a single day.|$|E
