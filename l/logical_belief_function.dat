40|$|AbstractIn general, {{combining}} Dempster-Shafer <b>belief</b> <b>functions</b> over a {{frame of}} n elements {{is a problem with}} exponential time complexity in n. This is a consequence of an exponential number of focal elements being generated when the focal elements of the <b>belief</b> <b>functions</b> being combined intersect. In order to avoid this undesirable behavior, we must impose some special structure on the focal sets. Our approach is to work with families of subsets that are closed under intersection. Hence, we present four polynomial time algorithms for combining some particular types of <b>belief</b> <b>functions.</b> In the first case, the case of Bayesian <b>belief</b> <b>functions,</b> we exploit the result that if any <b>belief</b> <b>function</b> is Bayesian, then the resulting <b>belief</b> <b>function</b> is also Bayesian. Thus the resulting <b>belief</b> <b>function</b> has no more than n focal elements. In the second case, the special case of polytomic <b>belief</b> <b>functions</b> over the same partition, we exploit the fact that no new focal elements are created. In the case of exact polytomic <b>belief</b> <b>functions,</b> we exploit the fact that the resulting <b>belief</b> <b>function</b> is also exact polytomic, with no more than n focal sets. Finally, in the case of hierarchical <b>belief</b> <b>functions,</b> we exploit the fact that the resulting <b>belief</b> <b>function</b> has the same hierarchy...|$|R
