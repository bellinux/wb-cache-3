5|$|The game is {{a remake}} of the {{original}} NES Mega Man title and has similar gameplay and level designs. The game moves on a 2D plane and players are given control of the game's eponymous hero Mega Man. Unlike the original's 8-bit graphics, the game uses 3D character models with super deformed designs. Mega Man's primary abilities include jumping and shooting and he is given both a health meter and a life meter. Mega Man can lose health by touching enemies or their projectiles, while <b>lives</b> <b>will</b> be lost when <b>Lives</b> <b>will</b> be consumed if Mega Man touches certain spikes, or falls into a pit. Lives and health can be found either dropped by enemies or in fixed locations.|$|E

25|$|It Gets Better is an Internet-based 501(c)3 nonprofit {{founded in}} the United States by gay activist, author, media pundit, and {{journalist}} Dan Savage and his husband Terry Miller on September 21, 2010, {{in response to the}} suicides of teenagers who were bullied because they were gay or because their peers suspected that they were gay. Its goal is to prevent suicide among LGBT youth by having gay adults convey the message that these teens' <b>lives</b> <b>will</b> improve. The project has grown rapidly: over 200 videos were uploaded in the first week, and the project's YouTube channel reached the 650 video limit in the next week. The project is now organized on its own website, the It Gets Better Project, and includes more than 50,000 entries from people of all sexual orientations, including many celebrities; the videos have received over 50 million views.|$|E

500|$|In {{the battle}} modes, instead of racing on tracks, the player speeds around battle arenas while {{collecting}} weapons and attacking opponents. There are five battle modes in Crash Nitro Kart. Each mode {{can be played}} by two to four players. In the [...] "Limit Battle", {{the objective is to}} attack opponents with weapons and traps while avoiding attacks unleashed by the opponents. Offensive and defensive weapons can be collected by smashing special crates. A point and time limit can be set by the player before the game begins. Whoever earns enough points or has enough points when time runs out wins. This mode can be played free-for-all or with teams. In [...] "Last Kart Driving", the contestants compete until they run out of lives. A contestant loses a life every time they are hit by a weapon or hazard or fall into a pit. A contestant who runs out of <b>lives</b> <b>will</b> be eliminated. As the title suggests, the last kart driving wins. This mode can be played free-for-all or with teams.|$|E
500|$|The {{structure}} of the book drew mixed reactions, with Toronto Star's Kim Hughs describing it as [...] "the novel's most defining feature and its most exasperating conceit". She believed that Pari {{was meant to be}} the protagonist of the story but that the shifting focus on the numerous other personalities left her [...] "barely [...] through the clutter". The Independent's Arifa Akbar stated, [...] "The changing points of view and leaps in time can confuse and confine, leaving characters clearly defined but lacking depth. Decades gallop by and {{it is as if the}} story of these interconnected, cross -generational <b>lives</b> <b>will</b> simply go on echoing the original crime of Abdullah and Pari's separation." [...] Michiko Kakutani from The New York Times thought the novella-like storytelling was handled well and wrote, [...] "Khaled Hosseini's new novel, And the Mountains Echoed, may have the most awkward title in his body of work, but it's his most assured and emotionally gripping story yet, more fluent and ambitious than The Kite Runner (2003), more narratively complex than A Thousand Splendid Suns (2007)." [...] Kamal agreed, saying that the structure was [...] "exquisitely crafted".

40|$|<b>Living</b> <b>will</b> is a multidisciplinary, ethical-law problem. When {{applied a}} legally {{competent}} patient as a lay person orders {{the medical staff}} as professionals how to treat him or her in case of him/her not being able, temporarily or permanently, to give an informed permission with a treatment or alternatively refuse such treatment. A patient {{has a right to}} express his/her wishes concerning a future health care for him/her-self in a time when he/she is no longer capable to decide on his/her own. The living will is a particular kind of an informed consent or decline targeted towards a future event which is to an extent uncertain. The presented thesis consists of two parts which are additionally divided into three chapters. The major aim of the first part is to give a comprehensive explanation of the <b>Living</b> <b>will's</b> position in the legal system of the Czech Republic. This part also analyses the relation of the modification embedded in the the Act on Health Services and Conditions of Their Provision and the Civil Code.
