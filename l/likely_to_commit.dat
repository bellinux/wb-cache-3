25|$|Some {{scientists}} propose using brain imaging to help {{decide which}} soon-to-be-released offenders are {{at greater risk}} for reoffending. The brain imaging data would be used along with common factors like age, prior arrests, and marital status. To support this idea, in a 2013 study, Professor Kent Kiehl from the University of New Mexico studying the population of 96 male offenders in the state’s prisons found that offenders with low activity in the anterior cingulate cortex where twice as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> an offense in the four years after their release as those who had high activity in this region. Similarly, Dustin Pardini conducted that which shows that men with a smaller amygdala are three times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> violence three years after their release.|$|E
25|$|Within these statistics, Japanese {{committed}} 6,925 violent crimes, {{of which}} 2,531 were arson or rape, while foreigners committed 323 violent crimes, but only 42 cases {{are classified as}} arson or rape.

Fraternities have often been accused of fostering rape-supportive attitudes by promoting male dominance and brotherhood, and fraternity affiliation {{has been found to}} be a significant predictor of sexually predatory behavior in retrospective research. Furthermore, studies show that women in sororities are almost twice as likely to experience rape than other college women.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{diverse and}} {{transgender}} indigenous Australians are {{often referred to}} as sistergirls and brotherboys. The level of acceptance varies with each community and its elders. In 2015 Dameyon Bonson established Black Rainbow as a mental health support and suicide prevention service for LGBTI indigenous Australians, given that they often suffer both racism and homophobia/transphobia, and additionally are 45 times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> suicide than the general population.|$|E
25|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} in the literature that blacks are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> violent crimes than are whites in the United States. Whether {{this is the case}} for less serious crimes is less clear. Black majority cities have similar crime statistics for blacks as do cities where majority of population is white. For example, white-plurality San Diego has a slightly lower crime rate for blacks than does Atlanta, a city which has black majority in population and city government.|$|E

This was the case of the rocker Gorki Águila and his group Porno para Ricardo. In August 2008, Águila was arrested under charges of dangerousness, a law that allows the authorities to detain people whom they think are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> crimes; even when they have not yet committed them.|$|E
25|$|Terrorist Recognition Handbook: A Practitioner's Manual for Predicting and Identifying Terrorist Activities is a non-fiction {{book about}} counterterrorism strategies, written by U.S. Navy retired {{cryptology}} analyst Malcolm Nance. The book {{is intended to}} help law enforcement and intelligence officials with the professional practice of behavior analysis and criminal psychology of anticipating potential terrorists before they commit criminal acts. Nance draws {{from the field of}} traditional criminal analysis to posit that detecting domestic criminals is similar to determining which individuals are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> acts of terrorism. The book provides resources for the law enforcement official including descriptions of devices used for possible bombs, a database of terrorist networks, and a list of references used. Nance gives the reader background on Al-Qaeda tactics, clandestine cell systems and sleeper agents, and terrorist communication methods.|$|E
5000|$|A Spanish {{study of}} traffic {{accidents}} between 1990 and 1999 found that cyclists wearing bicycle helmets {{who were involved}} in accidents were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>committed</b> a traffic law violation than unhelmeted cyclists, and that helmeted cyclists were no more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>committed</b> a speeding violation in association with the accident than unhelmeted cyclists. The authors concluded that [...] "although the findings do not support the existence of a strong risk compensation mechanism among helmeted cyclists, this possibility cannot be ruled out". In one experimental study, adults accustomed to wearing helmets cycled more slowly without a helmet, but no difference in helmeted and unhelmeted cycling speed was found for cyclists who do not usually wear helmets.|$|R

25|$|The {{longitudinal}} study Excess Mortality from Suicide and other External Causes of Death Among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants (2007), reported {{that women who}} sought breast implants are almost 3.0 times as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> suicide as are women who have not sought breast implants. Compared to the standard suicide-rate for women of the general populace, the suicide-rate for women with augmented breasts remained alike until 10-years post-implantation, yet it increased to 4.5 times greater at the 11-year mark, and so remained until the 19-year mark, when it increased to 6.0 times greater at 20-years post-implantation. Moreover, additional to the suicide-risk, women with breast implants also faced a trebled death risk from alcoholism and drugs abuse (prescription and recreational). Although seven studies have statistically connected a woman's undergoing a breast augmentation procedure to a greater suicide-rate, the research indicates that augmenation surgery does not increase the suicide death-rate; and that, in the first instance, it is the psychopathologically-inclined woman who is likelier to undergo breast augmentation.|$|E
25|$|Girls {{are most}} likely to enjoy high {{self-esteem}} when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, {{they are more likely to}} derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} was made {{over the objections of}} some victims and prosecutors involved in Clemmons' previous cases but was supported by the bipartisan parole board and the trial court judge in Clemmons' case. Mark Fraiser, an attorney who prosecuted early cases against Clemmons in Pulaski County, argued Clemmons was extremely <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> further acts of violence in the future, and said for a teen to receive such a lengthy prison sentence without committing a murder, [...] "you've got to be a bad little dude". On May 3, 2000, Huckabee commuted Clemmons' 108-year sentence to 47 years, 5 months and 19 days, which made him eligible for parole that day. As a factor in his decision, Huckabee cited the unusually long sentence for Clemmons' age at the time the crimes were committed. The Arkansas Parole Board unanimously approved Clemmons' release on July 13, 2000, and he was set free on August 1, 2000.|$|E

500|$|The navy, {{along with}} other {{military}} branches, served as dumping grounds for thousands of young, poverty-stricken, sometimes orphaned black individuals who were stuck in the 'dregs' of Brazil's cities. Many had committed or were suspected of committing crimes—though those not in legal trouble were far from safe, as some recruits were seized off the streets or simply on the losing end of settling a personal score. Such measures served as a [...] "perfect marriage of punishment and reform": people who had or were <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> crimes would be removed from society and trained in skills that would benefit the country. These men were commonly sent to the navy, apprenticed around the age of 14, and bound to the navy for fifteen years. João Cândido Felisberto, {{a leader in the}} later Revolt of the Lash, was apprenticed at age 13 and joined the navy at 16. Individuals forced into the navy served for twelve years. Volunteers, who perhaps unsurprisingly made up a very low percentage of recruits, signed on for nine years.|$|E
500|$|Some {{women with}} {{neurological}} conditions experience increased activity of their conditions {{at about the}} same time during each menstrual cycle. For example, drops in estrogen levels have been known to trigger migraines, especially when the woman who suffers migraines is also taking the birth control pill. Many women with epilepsy have more seizures in a pattern linked to the menstrual cycle; this is called [...] "catamenial epilepsy". Different patterns seem to exist (such as seizures coinciding with the time of menstruation, or coinciding with the time of ovulation), and the frequency with which they occur has not been firmly established. Using one particular definition, one group of scientists found that around one-third of women with intractable partial epilepsy has catamenial epilepsy. An effect of hormones has been proposed, in which progesterone declines and estrogen increases would trigger seizures. Recently, studies have shown that high doses of estrogen can cause or worsen seizures, whereas high doses of progesterone can act like an antiepileptic drug. Studies by medical journals have found that women experiencing menses are 1.68 times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> suicide.|$|E

50|$|Regarding {{studies that}} {{indicate}} that girls are as likely or more <b>likely</b> than boys <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> IPV, the authors emphasize that substantial differences {{exist between the}} genders, including that girls are significantly more <b>likely</b> than boys <b>to</b> report having experienced severe IPV, such as being threatened with a weapon, punched, strangled, beaten, burned, or raped, and are also substantially more <b>likely</b> than boys <b>to</b> need psychological help or experience physical injuries that require medical help for the abuse, and to report sexual violence {{as a part of}} dating violence. They are also more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> take IPV more seriously. By contrast, boys are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report experiencing less severe acts, such as being pinched, slapped, scratched or kicked. Girls are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>committing</b> less serious forms of IPV, including as a means of self-defense, whereas boys are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>committing</b> more severe acts of IPV, including threats, physical violence and controlling a partner. That girls are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> engage in IPV as a result of self-defense is supported by findings that previous victimization is a stronger predictor of perpetration in females than in males. Other research indicates that boys who have been abused in childhood by a family member are more prone to IPV perpetration, while girls who have been abused in childhood by a family member are prone to lack empathy and self-efficacy; but the risks for the likelihood of IPV perpetration and victimization among adolescents vary and are not well understood.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{profiling}} {{information for}} speeding offenders and {{is part of}} a larger project that assessed the deterrent effects of increased speeding penalties in Queensland, Australia, using a total of 84, 456 speeding offences. The speeding offenders were classified into three groups based on the extent and severity of an index offence: once-only low-rang offenders; repeat high-range offenders; and other offenders. The three groups were then compared in terms of personal characteristics, traffic offences, crash history and criminal history. Results revealed a number of significant differences between repeat high-range offenders and those in the other two offender groups. Repeat high-range speeding offenders were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be male, younger, hold a provisional and a motorcycle licence, <b>to</b> have <b>committed</b> a range of previous traffic offences, to have a significantly greater likelihood of crash involvement, and to have been involved in multiple-vehicle crashes than drivers in the other two offender types. Additionally, when a subset of offenders’ criminal histories were examined, results revealed that repeat high-range speeding offenders were also more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>committed</b> a previous criminal offence compared to once only low-range and other offenders and that 55. 2 % of the repeat high-range offenders had a criminal history. They were also significantly more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>committed</b> drug offences and offences against order than the once only low-range speeding offenders, and significantly more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>committed</b> regulation offences than those in the other offenders group. Overall, the results indicate that speeding offenders are not an homogeneous group and that, therefore, more tailored and innovative sanctions should be considered and evaluated for high-range recidivist speeders because they are a high-risk road user group...|$|R

For immigration in general, a majority of studies in the U.S. have found lower crime rates among immigrants than among non-immigrants, and that higher concentrations of immigrants are associated with lower crime rates.

5000|$|Corax is {{probably}} best known for developing the “reverse-probability argument," [...] {{also known as the}} Art of Corax. If a person is accused of a crime which he is not <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>committed</b> (for example, a small man physically attacking a large man, against whom he is almost certainly doomed to fail), his defense will be that {{it is unlikely that the}} crime occurred. His argument draws on the lack of means of the accused. However, if a person is accused of a crime which he is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>committed</b> (in the case of a larger man attacking a smaller man), he can also use the defense that it is unlikely that he did it, for the very reason that it appears too probable. This man draws on the lack of prospect of getting away unsuspected. It works by anticipating the audience’s expectations, and then combatting that expectation with a countermove. This pattern of anticipating and then contradicting an audience’s expectation has continued to be a typical move in reverse probability arguments to this day.|$|R
