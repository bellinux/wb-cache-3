500|$|The backcountry {{relied heavily}} on a diet based on mush made from soured milk or boiled grains. Clabber, a yogurt-like food made with soured milk, was a {{standard}} breakfast dish and was eaten by backcountry settlers of all ages. This dietary habit was not shared by other British immigrant groups and was equally despised by those still in Britain. The Anglican missionary Charles Woodmason, who spent time among Ulster Irish immigrants, described them as depending [...] "wholly on butter, milk, clabber and what in England is given to hogs". Oatmeal mush was a popular meal in the British borderlands and remained popular in America. The only difference was that the oatmeal was replaced by corn, and is still known today in the South as grits. Cakes of unleavened dough baked on bakestones or circular griddles were common and went by names such as [...] "clapbread", [...] "griddle cakes" [...] and [...] "pancakes". While the potato had originated in South America, it did not become established in North America until it {{was brought to the}} colonies by northern British settlers in the 18th century and became an important backcountry staple along with corn. Pork had been a food taboo among northern Britons and the primary meat had been sheep. In the American colonies the raising of sheep was not as efficient and mutton was therefore replaced with pork. The habit of eating [...] "sallet" [...] or [...] "greens" [...] remained popular, but the vegetables of the Old World were replaced with plants like squashes, gourds, beans, corn, <b>land</b> <b>cress,</b> and pokeweed. The distinctive cooking style of the British borderlands and the American backcountry was boiling. Along with clabber, porridge, and mushes, the typical dishes were various stews, soups and pot pies.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Land</b> <b>cress</b> can {{be grown}} easily in any garden. Like watercress, it loves water, but does not do well when {{partially}} submerged {{for long periods of}} time. This perennial needs full sun and frequent watering in any garden, unless near a direct source of water.|$|E

It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, and naturalized elsewhere It has been cultivated as a leaf vegetable in England since the 17th century. As it requires less water than watercress, {{it is easier to}} cultivate.|$|E

Some of these common names may {{be shared with}} other plants in the Brassicaceae family and are {{therefore}} of limited usefulness since they may be shared. As Old English stune, the plant is cited {{as one of the}} herbs invoked in the pagan Anglo-Saxon Nine Herbs Charm, recorded in the 10th century.|$|E

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Belgium, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), compiled an application to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance indoxacarb in rucola, cress, <b>land</b> <b>cress,</b> red mustard, other lettuce and salad plants, purslane (including sorrel and glassworth), beet leaves and other spinach and similar (leaves). In order to accommodate for the intended uses of indoxacarb, Belgium proposed to raise the existing MRLs from the limit of quantification to 1 mg/kg. Belgium drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 1 mg/kg for the proposed uses on rucola, cress, <b>land</b> <b>cress,</b> red mustard, other lettuce and salad plants, purslane (including sorrel and glassworth), beet leaves and other spinach and similar (leaves). Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of indoxacarb on the commodities under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed use of indoxacarb on rucola, cress, <b>land</b> <b>cress,</b> red mustard, other lettuce and salad plants, purslane (including sorrel and glassworth), beet leaves and other spinach and similar (leaves) will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|E
40|$|Phytoremediation {{is a new}} {{technology}} that employs plants to remediate contaminated soils. This method compared to those that involve the use of large scale energy consuming equipments is an inexpensive method. Phytoremediation models are useful tools to further understanding the governing processes and also to manage the contaminated soils. A thorough literature review indicates that very few models {{have been developed for}} phytoremediation due to the complexity of the phenomena. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a simple model for phytoremediation of lead and cadmium. A new formulation of phytoremediation was established based on soil and plant responses to heavy metal pollution. A large quantity of a sandy loam soil was thoroughly mixed to ensure homogeneous different concentration levels by lead and cadmium. These contaminated soils were transferred to some plastic pots. <b>Land</b> <b>Cress</b> (Barbarea verna) and Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) seeds were germinated in pots containing 8 kg of contaminated soil. Plants were harvested at five time intervals. The concentrations of Pb and Cd in the plant and soil samples were digested by wet oxidation and 4 M Nitric acid digestion methods, respectively, and were determined by flame and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry methods. Proposed models then were calibrated using the collected data and validated quantitatively. The results indicated that the soil adsorption isotherms followed a linear form for both Pb and Cd concentrations. The results also indicated that the phytoremediation rate of Pb by <b>Land</b> <b>Cress</b> and Spinach are first-order function of Pb concentration in soil. In contrast, a zero-order function of soil Cd contaminations was obtained. Combining these two results of soil and plant responses to Pb and Cd pollution, a simple model with reasonable performance was derived to predict the time needed for remediation of soil Pb (R 2 &gt; 0. 98). However, in the case of Cd, the derived models appeared to be useful to make only some overall estimations of the remediation (R 2 ≈&nbsp; 0. 70). ...|$|E
