25|$|Albus Dumbledore {{was tall}} and thin, with silver hair and beard (auburn in his youth) so long {{that they could be}} tucked into his belt. He had a very long and crooked nose that <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been broken at least twice. (It is speculated that his brother's punch during their sister's funeral may {{have played a role in}} shaping his nose.) He was also said to have had long and {{skillful}} fingers. His eyes were described to be a brilliant, soul-piercing shade of blue, and usually twinkled with kindness and mischief.|$|E
25|$|The second specimen, CAGS-IG-T1, also {{preserves}} {{the remains of}} several meals. Disarticulated bones were found, {{in front of the}} lower ischia, identified as belonging to at least two individuals of Confuciusornis sanctus, a basal bird that is very common in the formation. Also a 13.5 centimetres long scapula was discovered, belonging to some 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) long herbivorous ornithischian, perhaps Yueosaurus or a Psittacosaurus species. The bone surface of the scapula <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been etched by stomach acid for about thirteen days, leading to the conclusion the birds were swallowed later and in quick succession. This again would indicate a high metabolism for Sinocalliopteryx, necessitating a regular food intake.|$|E
25|$|Partridge was {{instrumental}} in the apprehension of the gang of murderers and body snatchers called the London Burkers, after the Edinburgh murderers Burke and Hare of three years earlier. On 5 November 1831, shortly after he had taken up the position of demonstrator of anatomy at King's College, the four members of the gang attempted to sell him the body of the so-called 'Italian Boy' for nine guineas. Both Partridge and the dissecting-room porter, William Hill, were suspicious of the fresh state of the body, which <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> never been buried, as well as of a cut on its forehead. Partridge is said to have delayed the gang members with the ruse of claiming to lack change for a fifty-pound note, whilst raising the alarm with his superior, Herbert Mayo. All four members of the London Burker gang were arrested while still awaiting payment.|$|E

25|$|It was the Adventure Comics run which {{established}} the Legion's general workings and environment. A club of teenagers, they operated {{out of a}} clubhouse {{in the shape of}} an inverted yellow rocket ship which <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been driven into the ground. The position of Legion leader rotated among the membership. Each Legionnaire had to possess one natural superpower which no other member possessed; despite this, several members had overlapping powers, particularly Superboy, Supergirl, Mon-El, and Ultra Boy. Some issues included comical moments where candidates with bizarre, useless, or dangerous abilities would try out for membership and be rejected; five of these flawed candidates went on to form the Legion of Substitute Heroes. The Legion was based on Earth and protected an organization of humans and aliens called the United Planets. The regular police force in the United Planets was the Science Police. The setting for each story was 1000 years from the date of publication.|$|E
500|$|The Derry Provisionals {{had little}} contact with the IRA elsewhere. [...] They had few weapons (about twenty) which they used mainly for sniping. [...] At the same time, they {{launched}} their bombing campaign in Derry. [...] Unlike in Belfast, they were careful to avoid killing or injuring innocent people. [...] Eamonn McCann wrote that [...] "the Derry Provos, under Martin McGuinness, had managed to bomb the city centre until it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been hit from the air without causing any civilian casualties." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cappon {{was known}} for his {{conservatism}} as a coach. [...] In 23 years at Princeton, the uniforms never changed, having small sewn-on numbers and no player names. [...] He considered a fast break as a lack of discipline and would not allow his players to shoot before five or ten passes had been completed. [...] In 1995, former Princeton player Selden Edwards wrote an article on Cappon's influence at Princeton. [...] Edwards, a junior varsity player in the Cappon era, wrote that [...] "Cappy was Princeton basketball to anyone even vaguely familiar with the teams of that era." [...] Edwards described Cappon's physical appearance this way: [...] "In 1959, the fall I arrived at Princeton, Cappy was in peak form, a character who knew he was a character. He was in his early sixties, and his body <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been sculpted in ice cream and left in the sun. He was bald, the skin on his face drooped, he had deep shadows under his eyes. His voice was gravelly, and he enunciated as if he had wads of Kleenex in his mouth. He always said exactly what he meant, and his language was delightfully salty. Legend had it that he had been a great athlete at Michigan, but by the 1960s no one could imagine that. He was grumpily personable and totally without pretension." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E
