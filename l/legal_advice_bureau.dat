50|$|The Citizens Advice {{service is}} one of the largest {{volunteer}} organisations in the United Kingdom with 21,600 volunteers. The majority of these are part-time volunteer advisers, but the figure also includes trustees and administrators. While volunteers have varying levels of training, they are all required to receive basic training to ensure they fully understand the nature of the service including the four basic principles. Typically there will be a paid <b>bureau</b> manager, <b>advice</b> session supervisors and in some cases some paid advisers. Some staff may be qualified to give specialist <b>legal</b> <b>advice</b> or to advise on immigration. Each Citizens Advice is an affiliated to the national organisation but they are managed and run locally. Many bureaux are also limited companies and may have a board of directors, who will also be the organisation's trustees. Bureaux throughout the United Kingdom have varying community needs and very different resources, and consequently offer different styles and levels of service. All bureaux in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are members of Citizens Advice, the operating name of The National Association of Citizens <b>Advice</b> <b>Bureaux.</b> Northern Ireland bureaux are also members of the Northern Ireland Association of Citizens <b>Advice</b> <b>Bureaux</b> (NIACAB).

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} pilot study {{research}} {{which sought to}} explore perceptions and experiences of vulnerable employees who attempted to use the Employment Tribunal (ET) system to resolve disputes. We interviewed clients of a Citizens <b>Advice</b> <b>Bureau</b> seeking to explore the concerns of those for whom the system potentially poses the greatest barriers—those who cannot afford <b>legal</b> <b>advice</b> and/or are not trade union members. We conclude that the ETs, and the mediating role played by Acas, produce barriers to justice for vulnerable employees. Furthermore, {{the role played by}} Citizens Advice is critical in reclaiming labour law’s public law function, by which private disputes between individuals are translated into matters of public concern...|$|R
