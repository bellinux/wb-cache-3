5|$|A dispute {{concerning}} {{the financing of}} lighthouses <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> 1898 visit to Dubh Artach of some prominent persons, including the President of the Board of Trade and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Michael Hicks Beach.|$|E
2500|$|This system <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{proliferation}} of celebrants and excessive competition. [...] It also <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lowering of standards. In 2010, Melbourne journalist Mark Russell noted: ...|$|R
30|$|Application of {{a dynamic}} PCL brace <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{reduction}} in peak PFJ pressures in PCL-deficient knees. In addition, the brace <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{significant reduction in}} peak pressures in PCL/PLC-deficient knees at 60 °, 90 °, and 120 ° of flexion. Application of the dynamic brace also <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> reduction in total PFJ force across all flexion angles for both PCL- and PCL/PLC-deficient knees.|$|R
50|$|The Firm's growth also <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{building}} boom in 2006 and 2007, with newly constructed offices in Myrtle Beach and expanded space in Charlotte. Growth in Atlanta <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{move into a}} new office building at Atlantic Station.|$|R
5|$|As Julio made landfall, it {{produced}} lightning and locally heavy rainfall, which left {{more than a}} dozen communities isolated due to flooding. The flooding damaged several houses and killed two people. Winds were generally light, although strong enough to damage a few electrical poles and small buildings. In nearby Sinaloa, rainfall from the storm <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> emergency evacuation of 500 residents.|$|E
5|$|As a {{response}} to the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, Venizelos's power base was further strengthened, and on 8 October 1908 the Cretan Assembly passed a resolution in favor of union despite both the reservations of the Athens government under Georgios Theotokis and the objections of the Great Powers. The muted reaction of the Athens Government to the news from Crete <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unsettled state of affairs on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} neared the Florida Keys on September25, its eye reformed and became more pronounced on satellite imagery. The reorganization <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> increase in intensity, and at about 1530UTC, Georges made landfall near Key West with winds of 105mph (160km/h). The hurricane's forward motion shifted to west-northwest, and forecast models indicated that Georges would re-attain Category 3 status before making landfall {{along the northern}} Gulf Coast. The slow motion of the storm <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> erratic track, mainly caused by westward wobbles of the eye. Vertical wind shear was estimated at up to 35mph (55km/h), restricting outflow within {{the hurricane}} and confining the most intense convection to {{the eastern side of}} the circulation.|$|E
50|$|Years of {{capturing}} wild fish together with improved fishing technology have <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> continuous decrease incapture production in South Korea in recent years, and consequently <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> greater attention toaquaculture {{to meet the}} increasing demand for aquatic products.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, CND {{enjoyed a}} {{significant}} revival. The deployment of SS20s in the Soviet Bloc countries <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> counter positioning of American Cruise Pershing II missiles in Western Europe, including Britain which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> huge growth in CND membership.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, the warty {{comb jelly}} colonized the Caspian Sea via the UDWS. The {{establishment}} of this population <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 60% {{reduction in the number}} of sprat, which in turn <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> reduction in the population of sturgeon and seals.|$|R
5|$|By 2003, many Turks {{had come}} to see American foreign policy in the region as a threat. Matters were not helped by the {{election}} in 2002 of the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The election of the AKP <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> immediate increase in tensions with America, especially after the Parliament's decision not to send any Turkish troops to Iraq further eroded US-Turkish relations. 70% of the parliament members were Justice and Development Party members.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{has been}} mined in Ashton {{since at least}} the 17th century. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries demand for coal increased, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{expansion}} of the town's coal industry. The produce of the collieries was transported by canal to Manchester. The industry began to decline during the late 19th century, and by 1904 only the Ashton Moss Colliery was still operational, the last colliery to be opened in the area.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker's disinclination to make {{concessions}} to Quebec, along with {{the disintegration of the}} Union Nationale, the failure of the Tories to build an effective structure in Quebec, and Diefenbaker appointing few Quebecers to his Cabinet, none to senior positions, all <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> erosion of Progressive Conservative support in Quebec. Diefenbaker did recommend the appointment of the first French-Canadian governor general, Georges Vanier.|$|E
50|$|The islanders were {{allies of}} the Carthaginians against Rome during the Punic Wars. Although the Battle of the Lipari Islands in 260 BC <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Carthaginian victory, the Romans later sacked Lipari and their {{domination}} <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> period of poverty.|$|R

5|$|Environmental {{concerns}} with electricity generation have <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> increased focus on generation from renewable sources, in particular from wind and hydropower. While debate {{can be expected}} to continue over the environmental impact of different means of electricity production, its final form is relatively clean.|$|E
5|$|Fighting colonial wars in Portuguese colonies {{had absorbed}} forty-four {{percent of the}} overall Portuguese budget. This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> obvious {{diversion}} of funds from necessary infrastructural developments in Portugal itself. This contributed to the growing unrest in the European nation. Portugal's GDP growth during the colonial war period (1961–1974), was strong and reached a 6% rate (a percentual GDP growth which were not achieved in any other comparable period after 1974).|$|E
5|$|In the Spring of 1924, Göppert {{entered the}} University of Göttingen, where she studied mathematics. A purported {{shortage}} of women mathematics teachers for schools for girls <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> upsurge of women studying mathematics {{at a time}} of high unemployment, and there was even a female professor of mathematics at Göttingen, Emmy Noether, but most were only interested in qualifying for their teaching certificates.|$|E

40|$|The asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase-like SlgZ and methyltransferase SlgM enzymes are {{involved}} in the biosynthesis of the tetramic acid streptolydigin in Streptomyces lydicus. Inactivation of slgZ <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> novel streptolydigin derivative. Overexpression of slgZ, slgM, or both in S. lydicus <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> considerable increase in streptolydigin production...|$|R
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, Moody's Investors Service cut Portugal's {{sovereign}} bond rating, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> increased pressure on Portuguese government bonds.

5|$|Initially, the {{excitement}} generated by Pac-Mans home release prompted retail stores {{to expand their}} inventory to sell video games. Drugstores began stocking video game cartridges, and toy retailers vied for new releases. Kmart and J. C. Penney competed against Sears to become the largest vendor of video games. The game's release also <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> increase in sales of the Atari 2600 console.|$|E
5|$|Moon's {{friendship}} with Entwistle <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> appearance on Smash Your Head Against the Wall, Entwistle's first solo album {{and the first}} {{by a member of}} the Who.

Rolling Stone's John Hoegel appreciated Entwistle's decision not to let Moon drum, saying that it distanced his album from the familiar sound of the Who.|$|E
50|$|Nucleus {{makes use}} of a {{callback}} function which has <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> plugin system in multiple languages.

5000|$|The flight {{envelope}} for the fighter-version demanded both {{more power and}} better compressor stall margins. This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new fan-stage (the so-called [...] "0-stage") was introduced, making the engine longer.

5|$|No tornado watches or {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{before the storm}} struck. This was later determined to be because of missing atmospheric sounding data, {{as well as an}} incorrect assessment of the height of the tropopause, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> underestimation of the strength of the thunderstorm which produced the tornado. Although a severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 2:57 pm, very few people received the warnings in time.|$|E
