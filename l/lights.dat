They play 18 different tracks, among which are Hedwig's theme from the Harry Potter films, the theme songs from E.T., , and Superman, and songs from Flight of the Valkyries. At Cedar Point and Kings Island, the WindSeeker sign changes colors during night operation. At Cedar Point, as the gondola makes its way up the tower, the LED <b>lights</b> at the top of the tower go out, making the tower invisible, though the LED <b>lights</b> on the gondola remains lit. When the gondola comes back down, the <b>lights</b> at the top of the tower come on again. At Canada's Wonderland, the LED <b>lights</b> at the top of the tower remain on throughout the cycle, keeping the tower visible at all times.|$|E

Gobo patterns are projected from the towers onto the midway and buildings. More than one million <b>lights,</b> including the <b>lights</b> on the stage, rides and buildings were added.

However, the <b>lights</b> went out before he {{had the chance to}} do so, and as a result the <b>lights</b> afterwards displayed the standard 5 red <b>lights</b> and 3 amber <b>lights.</b> The race was immediately stopped, but the red flag was not displayed until the cars came to the start/finish line.

5|$|Isaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, {{that white}} <b>lights,</b> such as sunlight, are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light. Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red <b>lights.</b> Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex <b>lights</b> (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic <b>lights</b> (in fact, by any set of three different <b>lights).</b> He demonstrated that to be the case, inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual {{signalling}} were Semaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and <b>lights,</b> and the heliograph.

Signal <b>lights,</b> which were secured in a wooden case, employed a battery-operated Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by signal <b>lights</b> could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire.|$|E
