25|$|Japanese {{law does}} not define those convicted in the post-1945 trials as criminals, {{despite the fact that}} Japan's governments have {{accepted}} the judgments made in the trials, and in the Treaty of San Francisco (1952). This is because the treaty does not mention the <b>legal</b> <b>validity</b> of the tribunal. Had Japan certified the <b>legal</b> <b>validity</b> of the war crimes tribunals in the San Francisco Treaty, the war crimes would have become open to appeal and overturning in Japanese courts. This would have been unacceptable in international diplomatic circles. Current Prime Minister Shinzō Abe has advocated the position that Japan accepted the Tokyo tribunal and its judgements as a condition for ending the war, but that its verdicts have no relation to domestic law. According to this view, those convicted of war crimes are not criminals under Japanese law.|$|E
25|$|Dicey's third legal {{criterion}} for constitutional supremacy is {{the existence of}} an authority to pronounce upon the <b>legal</b> <b>validity</b> or constitutionality of laws passed by the nation's law-making body. While the Constitution does not expressly vest powers of constitutional judicial review in the courts, this role has been assumed by the judiciary. Hence, the third criterion appears to be fulfilled.|$|E

50|$|The Act {{requires}} agencies, by October 21, 2003, {{to allow}} individuals or entities {{that deal with}} the agencies the option to submit information or transact with the agency electronically, when practicable, and to maintain records electronically, when practicable. The Act specifically states that electronic records and their related electronic signatures {{are not to be}} denied <b>legal</b> effect, <b>validity,</b> or enforceability merely because they are in electronic form, and encourages Federal government use of a range of electronic signature alternatives.|$|R
25|$|Cayman Islands – Same-sex {{marriage}} is only recognised in immigration cases. through a {{decision of the}} Immigration Appeals Tribunal (IAT) issued on 7 July 2016. The IAT recognised the <b>legal</b> <b>validity</b> of a foreign same-sex marriage {{for the purpose of}} adding the same-sex spouse of a work permit holder as a dependent of the latter. Following the Bermuda Supreme Court ruling, a test case before the territory's Supreme Court was filed regarding the recognition and performance of same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|Mochán's {{analyses}} {{are about the}} PREP numbers. The PREP totals are ignored when the official count begins, {{and do not have}} any <b>legal</b> <b>validity</b> for the purposes of deciding the election. On the other hand, the existence of overvotes and of undervotes is one of the grounds for requesting that an electoral packet be opened and recounted. Mochán notes that the official totals does not include the information on leftover blank ballots, so that a verification of undervotes and overvotes in the case of adding up errors is impossible.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} receive tithes was {{granted to the}} English churches by King Ethelwulf in 855. The Saladin tithe was a royal tax, but {{assessed}} using ecclesiastical boundaries, in 1188. The <b>legal</b> <b>validity</b> of the tithe system was affirmed under the Statute of Westminster of 1285. The Dissolution of the Monasteries led to the transfer of many rights to tithe to secular landowners and the Crown – and tithes could be extinguished until 1577 under an Act of the 37th year of Henry VIII's reign. Adam Smith criticized the system in The Wealth of Nations (1776), arguing that a fixed rent would encourage peasants to farm more efficiently.|$|E
50|$|What transpired on 28 January 2015 {{was due to}} a {{procedural}} impropriety {{on the part of}} the Parliament, which subsequently became a <b>legal</b> impediment to <b>validity</b> of the executive order by President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

50|$|Although {{every state}} {{has at least}} one law {{pertaining}} to electronic signatures, it is the federal law that lays out the guidelines for interstate commerce. The general intent of the ESIGN Act is spelled out in the very first section(101.a), that a contract or signature “may not be denied <b>legal</b> effect, <b>validity,</b> or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form”. This simple statement provides that electronic signatures and records are just as good as their paper equivalents, and therefore subject to the same legal scrutiny of authenticity that applies to paper documents.|$|R

25|$|The {{granting}} of probate {{is the first}} step in the legal process of administering the estate of a deceased person, resolving all claims and distributing the deceased person's property under a will. A probate court decides the <b>legal</b> <b>validity</b> of a testator's (deceased person's) will and grants its approval, also known as granting probate, to the executor. The probated will then becomes a legal instrument that may be enforced by the executor in the law courts if necessary. A probate also officially appoints the executor (or personal representative), generally named in the will, as having legal power to dispose of the testator's assets in the manner specified in the testator's will. However, through the probate process, a will may be contested.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Justice Ajit Nath Ray dissented and gave reasons for rejecting the basic {{features}} doctrine. He stated {{that since the}} Constitution {{is the source of}} all <b>legal</b> <b>validity</b> and is itself always valid, a constitutional amendment, being part of the Constitution itself, will also always be valid. The power to amend the Constitution is wide and unlimited, and there is neither a distinction nor any possibility of a difference between essential and non-essential features of the Constitution that may impede amendment. In fact, if Parliament's power to amend is extinguished because of essential features that are not expressly defined in the Constitution, the courts would be creating a new constitution. Justice Ray presented other problems of the basic features doctrine, criticizing it as being uncertain in scope. Without an evident definition of what the basic features are, the task of trying to amend the Constitution becomes unpredictable. In his view, all the provisions of the Constitution are essential but this does not prohibit them from being amendable.|$|E
500|$|Prior to ratification, {{the queen}} and her prime {{minister}} sought clarification about several articles in the main treaty that stated [...] "foreign relations" [...] would be controlled by a French resident and referenced [...] "establishments" [...] at Diego-Suarez Bay. Two key French negotiators, Minister Patrimonio and Admiral Miot, provided an explanation affixed to the treaty as an annex, which led the rulers of Madagascar to deem the treaty an adequate enough safeguard of their nation's sovereignty to warrant their approval and signature. However, the official treaty was published in Paris without the annex or any reference to it. When the annex was later published in London, the French denied it had any <b>legal</b> <b>validity.</b> France declared a protectorate over the island despite the opposition of the Malagasy government and the omission of this term from the treaty.|$|E
50|$|In court, a {{qualified}} electronic signature provided {{the highest level of}} probative value, which makes it difficult to refute its authorship. A {{qualified electronic signature}}, along with its qualified certificate is given the same consideration as a handwritten signature when used as evidence in <b>legal</b> proceedings. The <b>validity</b> of {{a qualified}} electronic signature that has been created with a qualified certificate must be accepted by other EU Member States regardless of what Member State the signature was produced in.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2011 the Daily Mail {{reported}} that Mati White, wife of celebrity chef Marco Pierre White, {{had received a}} demand from Shackleton's firm for £40,000 for non-payment of <b>legal</b> fees. The <b>validity</b> of the fees is disputed by Mrs White, with a friend stating: [...] "Mati employed Payne Hicks Beach two weeks, {{and the fact that}} they managed to accrue fees in that short time of £26,000 plus interest, making it now more than £37,000, is hotly disputed." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Act {{seeks to}} [...] "preclude {{agencies}} or courts from systematically treating electronic documents and signatures less favorably than their paper counterparts", so that citizens can {{interact with the}} Federal government electronically (S. Rep. 105-335). It requires Federal agencies, by October 21, 2003, to provide individuals or entities that deal with agencies the option to submit information or transact with the agency electronically, and to maintain records electronically, when practicable. It also addresses the matter of private employers being able to use electronic means to store, and file with Federal agencies, information pertaining to their employees. GPEA states that electronic records and their related electronic signatures {{are not to be}} denied <b>legal</b> effect, <b>validity,</b> or enforceability merely because they are in electronic form. It also encourages Federal government use of a range of electronic signature alternatives.|$|R
500|$|The Speaker of the Rhodesian parliament, ARW Stumbles, reconvened the Legislative Assembly on 25 November, resolving {{that if he}} did {{not there}} would be chaos. He feared that Gibbs might {{dramatically}} walk into the chamber in an attempt to stop the proceedings, but Gibbs did no such thing. The parliamentary opposition opened the meeting by asking whether the assembly was legal. Ahrn Palley, the lone white opposition MP, announced that as he saw it, [...] "certain Honourable Members in collusion have torn up the constitution under which this House meets. The proceedings have no <b>legal</b> <b>validity</b> whatsoever". Stumbles overruled this objection and two more interruptions from Palley, and suggested that any members with reservations might leave. Palley continued his loud protests until he was forcibly ejected by the Sergeant-at-Arms, shouting [...] "This is an illegal assembly! God save the Queen!" [...] Gondo and eight other opposition MPs followed Palley out; all ten of them rejoined the Legislative Assembly in February 1966.|$|E
500|$|In 1926, Robert C. Binkley and A. C. Mahr of Stanford University, {{wrote that}} German accusations {{of the article}} {{assigning}} war guilt were [...] "ill-founded" [...] and [...] "mistaken". The article was more [...] "an assumption of liability to pay damages than an admission of war guilt" [...] and compared it with [...] "a man who undertakes to pay all {{the cost of a}} motor accident than to the plea of guilty entered by an accused criminal". They wrote that [...] "it is absurd" [...] to charge the reparation articles of the treaty with any [...] "political meaning" [...] and the legal interpretation [...] "is the only one that can stand". They concluded that German opposition [...] "is based upon a text which has no <b>legal</b> <b>validity</b> whatsoever, and which Germany never signed at all." [...] Sidney Fay was the [...] "most outspoken and influential critic" [...] of the article. In 1928, he concluded that all of Europe shared the blame for the war and that Germany had no intention of launching a general European war in 1914.|$|E

In 1274, when Edward, now King, [...] returned to England, Ferrers pleaded that he had accepted the Kenilworth ruling, with its seven [...] years' redemption period, but that Edmund had refused. Edmund's defence was the Cippenham 'agreement' and Ferrers's failure to meet its terms. Ferrers argued that the 'agreement' was made under duress, but it was held that chancellor Chishall's presence at the signing gave it full <b>legal</b> <b>validity.</b>|$|E
50|$|The act was {{subsequently}} repealed {{in the article}} 395 of the Constitution of India and article 221 of the Constitution of Pakistan of 1956 to obtain true independence for the new states. Though the new constitutions did not have legal authority to repeal the act, it was done to sever the <b>legal</b> chain of <b>validity</b> and establish the constitution as an independent legal system. It has not been repealed in the United Kingdom, where it is still current legislation, although some sections have been repealed.|$|R

The prosecution started its case on 13 April 2010, and completed it on 25 May 2012. The discovery of more than 300 previously unknown bodies in a mass grave at the Tomasica mine near Prijedor in September 2013 caused a flurry of motions which ended with the court denying reopening prosecutorial evidence. The defence began its case on 16 October 2012 and completed it in March 2014; Karadžić decided not to testify.

The case was heard on 3 December and a ruling was handed down on 12 December 2013. The High Court unanimously struck the act down in its entirety, {{on the basis that}} it was in conflict with the federal Marriage Act, which defined marriage in Australia as the union {{of a man and a}} woman.

5000|$|On December 24, 2002, {{anticipating the}} {{expiration}} of exclusive marketing rights, generic drug manufacturers Mylan, Teva, Barr, and Ranbaxy {{applied to the}} FDA to market a generic form of modafinil.

There is some question whether a particle size patent is sufficient protection against the manufacture of generics. Pertinent questions include whether modafinil may be modified or manufactured to avoid the granularities specified in the new Cephalon patent, and whether patenting particle size is invalid because particles of appropriate sizes {{are likely to be}} obvious to practitioners skilled in the art.
