40|$|Within the {{research}} project “FR-TI 4 / 329 Research and development - creating an application {{system for the}} design and analysis of soil and rock anchors including the development of monitoring elements”, an extensive stage of field load tests of rock bolts was carried out. The tests were conducted at 14 locations with varied rock composition. Before the initial tests, a <b>loading</b> <b>stand</b> was designed and constructed. A total of 201 pieces of tensile tests of bolts having lengths from 0. 5 up to 2. 5 m, a diameter of 22 - 32 mm, were performed. These were fully threaded rods, self-drilling rods, and fiberglass rods. The bolts were clamped into the cement and resin. The loading tests were always performed until material failure of bolts or shear stress failure at the interface cement-rock. At each location, basic geotechnical survey {{was carried out in}} the form of core drilling in a length of 3. 0 metres with the assessment of the rock mass in situ, and laboratory testing of rock mechanics. Upon the completion of testing protocols, rock mass properties analysis was performed focusing on the evaluation of shear friction at the grouting-rock interface...|$|E

40|$|Forest {{managers}} in the Blue Mountains, of northeastern Oregon are currently faced with vast areas of forests with health problems and high fuel loadings. These conditions resulted {{from a combination of}} insect infestations, past management practices and the elimination of fire from the local ecosystems. These forests are now overstocked, diseased and contain vast amounts of dead woody debris on the forest floor posing a serious threat of large destructive fires. This paper presents an analysis of the economics and production of using a cable system to reduce thel <b>loading,</b> <b>stand</b> density, and minimize soil impacts. A combined thinning and salvage logging of the larger thels from the forest floorwas completed using a single-grip harvester to process the stems into logs and a medium sized swing yarder to transport the logs to landings. This combination of equipment was not common to the area and was chosen to minimize soil impacts. There were four units designated for skyline logging. Each unit had different terrain and stocking characteristics. Two units were logged uphill, one unit was logged downhill, and one unit was relatively flat. The harvester processed into logs all designated standing timber and any solid stems on the forest floor. A Diamond D 210 swing yarder using a standing skyline, tailtrees, and intermediate supports was used to transport the logs to the landing. Production estimates 'pmh = productive machine hours = bone dry unit See Appendix H for conversion to S/green ton. 2 for the harvester and yarder were 19. 24 tons/pmh' (9. 33 cunitsfhr) and 10. 40 tons/pmh (6. 48 cunits/pmh) respectively. Total logging cost for the system (stump to mill) was 169, 602. This equated to 73 /ton (1 15 /cunit) of material removed. On a per acre basis, the cost was 2827 (6985 /hectare). Net revenue from sawlogs was 39, 163. 75 or 663. 79 per acre. Net revenue from pulpwood was 97, 785. 79 or 1657. 39 per acre. This resulted in a net loss of 32, 653 or 544 per acre.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the performance measurements {{of carbon dioxide}} two-stage reciprocating compressors using a hot-gas <b>load</b> <b>stand.</b> Â The data is used to characterize the compressorsâ€™ performances and evaluate the oil management between the two compressors. A compressor <b>load</b> <b>stand</b> has been redesigned to conduct the compressor performance tests. Two hermetic reciprocating compressors, including two oil separators, two intercooling fans and safety control valves, {{are connected to the}} <b>load</b> <b>stand.</b> A membrane tank filled with the working fluid is connected to the <b>load</b> <b>stand,</b> using an appropriate back pressure on the membrane to ensure a fixed intermediate pressure as the anchor point of the hot gas cycle. The first series of compressor tests was conducted for varying suction pressures and varying discharge pressures with different pressure ratios. In a second series, the running time was varied and the suction pressure was kept constant. Based on these measurements, the compressor performance indices, such as the volumetric and overall isentropic efficiencies, have been determined. Furthermore, compressor initial clearance factor can be calculated, based on available compressor maps, which is useful tool for future carbon dioxide system modeling. Also, a simulation model to predict the compressor performance has been developed. The entire process can be simulated to provide the compressor performance data for different working conditions. Finally, the compressor performance measurements are used to validate the model predictions...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of compressors with refrigerant injection ports provides a less complex and less costly alternative to implementing multi-stage compressors with economization. The ports {{can be used}} to inject economized refrigerant during the compression process, which provides the desired cooling effect and decreases the work required to compress the gas per unit mass. Experiments have shown that injecting liquid or low quality refrigerant is effective for reducing the compressor exit temperature and improving system reliability, while injecting refrigerant vapor improves the cooling or heating capacity of the system. However, very little information is available for cycles operating with injection states between these limits of liquid and vapor injection. Theoretical work suggests that cycle performance with two-phase refrigerant injection can provide greater improvements in COP than vapor injection. In addition, experimental work has shown that increasing the number of stages in an economized cycle with a multi-stage compressor improves the cycle performance, and theoretical work suggests that increasing the number of injection ports would have a similar effect. Therefore, this paper presents the design of a compressor <b>load</b> <b>stand</b> for testing compressors with multiple injection ports. The <b>load</b> <b>stand</b> is based on a traditional hot gas bypass configuration but is capable of supplying refrigerant to injection ports at two different pressures between the compressor suction and discharge pressures. In addition, the state of the injected refrigerant can be controlled such that it is either superheated vapor or a saturated liquid-vapor mixture. To guide the design of the bench and size system components, a model was developed to predict the system performance with a commercially available R- 410 A compressor that has a single injection port. The model is used to predict the range of injection conditions that can be achieved with the <b>load</b> <b>stand</b> over a range of operating conditions. Finally, preliminary test results for the <b>load</b> <b>stand</b> operating without injection are presented, and the experimentally measured compressor performance is compared to the performance data published by the compressor manufacturer...|$|R

40|$|Even though {{solar power}} usage has seen rapid {{growth over the}} past decade, fossil fuel {{generation}} sources are still generally a less expensive means of producing power. The Liquid-Flooded Ericsson Cycle (LFEC) was investigated as a high efficiency power cycle for reducing the cost of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants and helping to address this cost disparity. High temperature flooded expansion was identified {{as one of the}} main challenges in regards to utilizing the LFEC as a power cycle. Thermodynamic models were developed to help assess the performance of the LFEC and a <b>load</b> <b>stand</b> was constructed to test a prototype high temperature flooded scroll expander. ^ The thermodynamic model allowed for the investigation of the impacts of working fluid selection on the performance of the LFEC. The selection of the flooding agent was found to be of particular importance for high temperature operation. The maximum operating temperature, specific heat capacity, and vapor pressure of individual liquids governed the potential performance of the LFEC. This model was used to help develop design criteria for a prototype high temperature scroll expander. ^ Nitrogen and the thermal oil Duratherm LT were chosen as the working fluids for the experimental <b>load</b> <b>stand.</b> The data collected showed poor performance of the prototype scroll expander. This was partially attributed to excessive leakage in the device. A mismatch between the internal volume ratio and the imposed system conditions was believed to have exaggerated the leakage problem. Regardless of the poor performance these test have demonstrated the operation of a scroll machine at higher temperatures and flooding ratios than previously investigated in the literature. They provide a platform upon which to build to further knowledge of high temperature flooded expansion. ^ A comparative study was performed to assess the potential performance of the LFEC against other power cycles proposed for use in CSP facilities. This consisted of comparisons between variations of Rankine, Brayton, and combined cycles. From this analysis it was found that for sufficiently high component efficiencies the LFEC can provide higher conversion efficiencies than the other cycles under consideration. ^ The work done in this study has identified the LFEC as a promising power cycle for solar thermal power generation. The need for high efficiency components necessitates continued design and experimental investigation of machines capable of tolerating liquid flooding. Special attention needs to be given to the design of high temperature expansion devices and the challenges they bring. Through further development of system components the LFEC can become a viable alternative for CSP power blocks. ...|$|R

The hermetically sealed rolling piston compressor runs on a 24 V DC power supply. Because of its small size and compact form factor, it can potentially {{be used in a}} miniature vapor compression refrigeration system for electronics cooling applications. Compressor tests are conducted for varying suction pressures, pressure ratios, and rotational speeds. For each test, the refrigerant mass flow rate, electrical power consumption, and the suction and discharge temperature and pressure are recorded, at a suction superheat of 5 K. Using the experimental data, the compressor volumetric and overall isentropic efficiencies are calculated. Also, by assuming a subcooling of 5 K in the condenser, a hypothetical cooling capacity of the system and the corresponding COP are calculated. The volumetric efficiency ranges from 73 % to 90 % and the overall isentropic efficiency varies from 44 % to 70 % for pressure ratios between 2 and 3. 5. For this range of pressure ratios, the estimated cooling capacity and the COP vary from 163 W to 489 W and 2. 1 to 7. 4, respectively...|$|R
