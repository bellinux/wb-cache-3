25|$|When the Prussian commander, Helmuth von Moltke, saw {{the white}} flag, he sent Fritz Bronsart von Schellendorf {{to find out}} what it meant. Napoleon sent him back with one of his own officers, General A.-C.-V. Reille, who carried a letter {{offering}} to surrender. After reading it, von Moltke sent Reille back with a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance.</b> Wimpffen was ordered to arrange the surrender. This day, Sedantag in German (French journ√©e de Sedan), became a holiday in the German Empire. The first, brief attempt to avoid disaster through an armistice had failed and the emperor had become a prisoner of war.|$|E
25|$|After serving {{aboard the}} Sterling for 11 months, Cooper joined the United States Navy on January 1, 1808, when he {{received}} his commission as a midshipman. Cooper had conducted himself well as a sailor, and his father, a former U.S. Congressman, easily secured a commission for him through his long-standing connections with politicians and naval officials. The warrant for Cooper's commission as midshipman was signed by President Jefferson and mailed by Naval Secretary Robert Smith, reaching Cooper on February 19. Along with the warrant was a copy of naval rules and regulations, {{a description of the}} required naval uniform, along with an oath that Cooper was to sign in front of a witness and to be returned with his <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance.</b> Cooper signed the oath and had it notarized by New York attorney William Williams, Jr., who had previously certified the Sterling's crew. After Williams had confirmed Cooper's signature, Cooper mailed the document to Washington. On February 24, he received orders to report to the naval commander at New York City. Joining the United States Navy fulfilled an aspiration Cooper had had since his youth.|$|E

500|$|Hancock {{was officially}} {{notified}} of his nomination in July, and responded {{with the traditional}} <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance.</b> As Garfield had, the Democratic nominee sought to cause no controversy in his statement, which according to biographer David M. Jordan was [...] "bland and general". After scorning the previous years of Republican rule, Hancock sought to tamp down fears that election of a Democrat would overturn {{the results of the}} war and Reconstruction, a common Republican campaign theme. Unlike Garfield, Hancock had no record in elected office, but the acceptance letter gave no further indication of his political preferences. Hancock remained on active duty during the campaign at his post on Governors Island in New York Harbor.|$|E
500|$|Three weeks later, Weaver {{published}} his formal <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance,</b> calling for all party members to [...] "go {{forth in the}} great struggle for human rights". In {{a departure from the}} political traditions of the day, Weaver himself campaigned, making speeches across the South in July and August. As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, Weaver and Chambers hoped to make inroads in the South. Chambers's own participation was limited, as before reaching home from the convention, he fell and broke two ribs as he exited his train. He was confined to bed for several weeks and considered withdrawing from the race, but decided against it; his efforts were limited by his injuries, and his only contribution to the campaign was to publish his newspaper.|$|E
500|$|In his <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance,</b> Grant {{concluded}} with [...] "Let us have peace", which became his campaign slogan. For vice president, the delegates nominated House Speaker Schuyler Colfax. Grant's 1862 General Order No. 11 {{became an issue}} during the presidential campaign; he sought {{to distance himself from}} the order, saying [...] "I have no prejudice against sect or race, but want each individual to be judged by his own merit." [...] As President, Grant would atone for 1862's expulsion of the Jews. Historian Jonathan Sarna argues that Grant became one of the greatest friends of Jews in American history, meeting with them often and appointing them to high office. He was the first president to condemn atrocities against Jews in Europe, thus putting human rights on the American diplomatic agenda. As was expected at the time, Grant returned to his home state and left the active campaigning to his campaign manager, William E. Chandler, and others. The Republican campaign focused on continuing Reconstruction and restoring the public credit.|$|E

The works comprises the design and construction of the infrastructure and system works in respect of the project which is to be completed within 60 months from the commencement date. The project cost has escalated due to rise in oil prices and building materials. The group managing director, Datuk Lin Yun Ling, added that the company will undertake only 20 percent of the whole project {{while the rest of the}} construction will be out sourced to various companies around the country. The project will be implemented as a construction contract with progressive payments, instead of private finance initiative envisioned earlier.

2500|$|On August 15, 2011, the United States again {{deferred}} the ROCAF {{request to}} purchase 66 new F-16C/Ds but offered a retrofit package for older F-16A/B's. A $5.3 billion upgrade package for ROCAF's existing F-16A/B fighters was announced on 21 September 2011. The upgrade budget {{was to be}} spread over 12 years, though the Ministry of Defense indicated that it would try to reduce the period. In November 2011, the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission recommended that new fighters be sold to the ROCAF. Nonetheless, as of 2012, the MND was still haggling with the Pentagon over cost and local industry participation on the upgrade. After denying the RoC Air Force the funds needed to upgrade their jet engines, President Ma Ying-jeou said that he hoped that the upgraded fighters would have on par performance. Taiwan is also balking {{at the cost of}} the radar upgrade, as it {{does not want to be}} the lead customer who pays to develop the upgrade and also because they will be unable to afford both the upgrade and the new fighters, should these be offered. In response to a U.S. vote in the House of Representatives to force the sale of the C/D models, the ROC MND said that the upgrade package offered some superior capabilities over the C/D model aircraft and some defense officials have said that in light of the PRC's increasing capabilities, only the F-35 would be sufficient. In July 2012, Taiwan's Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. and Lockheed Martin announced plans to establish a maintenance and overhaul center to upgrade and maintain the F-16s in place without having to ship them back to the United States. In 2012 a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> was agreed on for a US$3.8 billion deal that included the radars, electronic warfare, structural improvements and new weapons. The high cost of the fighter upgrade is causing other modernization priorities such as tanks to be pushed back. [...] A Pentagon report has corroborated that claim, asserting that the PRC would probably seek to destroy ROCAF airfields in the first stages of any attack, making a STOVL fighter such as the F-35B vital for effective defense.|$|E

Charles the Bald, king of West Francia, tried to install his own palatine cleric, Hilduin, as archbishop.

On 7 January 870, Wilbert was acclaimed by Liutbert {{with the consent of}} the clergy and people of the diocese, with Odilbald of Utrecht assisting the consecration. Pope Hadrian II sent an embassy under Wibod, bishop of Parma, carrying his <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance.</b> His appointment was made rapidly in order to foil any attempt by Louis's rival, Charles the Bald, to fill the vacant see with a candidate favourable to him.

[...] Starting in 2009, the PSAT is an application requirement for public, private, and home schooling students. As the AOS science, math, and research curriculum has gained popularity over the years, the number of applicants have soared. Beginning in the 2014-2015 school year, the application process will be split into two parts, {{similar to that of}} other magnet schools like TJHSST. During the first phase of admissions, students are required to submit an online application and complete both the PSAT and the CCTDI. After the first phase, approximately 1/3 of applicants are selected to participate in the final phase of admissions. During the second and final phase, students are required to submit two teacher recommendations, six short answer questions, complete a supervised writing prompt, and complete the CCTST. <b>Letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> are usually mailed around late March.
