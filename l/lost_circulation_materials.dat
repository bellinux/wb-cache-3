30|$|There are {{two general}} {{approaches}} {{to prevent or}} minimize lost circulation problems. The first approach is called the preventive approach. This method can be used when the drill engineer anticipates that a lost circulation event may occur in a specific zone, but has not yet occurred. In this approach, lost circulation can be prevented by adding materials to the mud that will seal fractures and strengthen the wellbore, therefore, preventing a fracture from further propagation or worsening the fluid loss. The second approach is called corrective lost circulation treatment and {{can be achieved by}} adding materials known as <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials.</b> When mixed with the mud, <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> have the ability to plug the fracture and seal it if their particle size is big enough to do so. The type, shape, composition, size distribution and strength of the <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> (LCMs) can also be important to design an efficient solution treatment to address lost circulation (White 1956). In this paper, we propose a smart expandable material made out of shape memory polymers that can seal the fracture and strengthen the wellbore.|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{problem of}} lost {{circulation}} {{have for a}} long time occurred during the drilling operation. During the drilling through induced and natural fractures, huge drilling fluid losses lead to the higher operational expenses. That is why, it is vital to design the drilling fluid, so that it may minimize the mud invasion in to formation and prevent lost circulation. Generally, the mud loss occurs in the cavernous and vugular formations, as well as naturally occurring or induced fractures, or fractures in permeable and low permeability formations. Historically, this problem was dealt {{with the help of the}} <b>Lost</b> <b>Circulation</b> <b>Materials</b> (LCM). These materials are added to the drilling fluid to seal the fractures and to increase fracture initiation or fracture propagation pressure. The <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> may be used in the form of pills, when the lost circulation zone is identified. In some cases, solutions to lost circulation may be obtained by the pretreatment of the drilling mud with the particles of the proper material and with the proper particle size distribution. Subsequent treatment is also important, as a form of lost circulation prevention, when the particles are efficiently added to the mud system in the correct size, shape and type. Understanding the mechanisms of fracture sealing and the performance of the <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> is critical if the problem of lost circulation is to be mitigated effectively. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the performance of the chosen <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> (i. e LC-Lube) in 60 / 40 and 80 / 20 oil/water ratio OBM mud systems. The bridging performance of LC-Lube was studied with the help of the bridging tests in the laboratory. The D 50 of the particle size distribution was 310 μm. The slot openings used in the bridging tests were 100 μm, 250 μm, 300 μm, 400 μm and 500 μm. The concentration of LC-lube additive were 16, 85 lb/bbl and 8, 49 lb/bbl. The results of the tests were compared and the performance of the bridging materials discussed and analyzed. The results have shown that the LCM performance in two different mud systems when it comes to bridging, was better with 60 / 40 OBM in the case of 250 μm and 300 μm slot openings and a concentration of 16, 85 lb/bbl. In the case of a lower concentration of the LC-lube, the performance with the 60 / 40 was as well better with the slot openings of 250 μm and 300 μm, although the difference was less pronounced...|$|E

Those tests involved the use of standard mud testing equipment and a <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> test cell. The optimum concentration of the durian rind-which had been cleaned, cut into small pieces, dried in an oven at 60 °C for 24 hours, and ground into small fine particles-was determined before a performance comparison study was done on both Hydro-plug (i. e., a commercial <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>material)</b> and durian rind of different sizes, namely fine (0. 5 mm), medium (1. 0 mm), and coarse (2. 0 mm).

30|$|The {{two main}} types of {{drilling}} fluids are WBM and OBM (Caenn and Darley et al. 2017). To prepare the drilling mud, the current industry practice prefers to use macro material fluids {{referred to as}} <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> (LCMs) that offer limited features which increase drilling operation time and consequently costs (Zakaria and Husein et al. 2012). Between OBM and WBM common practice is utilizing WBM as it is cheaper and more environmentally friendly (Rodrigues and Lachter et al. 2006; Sadeghalvaad and Sabbaghi 2015) while OBM allowed by the law. However, although more effective, OBM is costly and causes damage to the environment (Akhtarmanesh and Shahrabi et al. 2013; Abduo and; Dahab et al. 2016). Therefore, this study proposes a newer approach by nanotechnology to replace OBM with nano-WBM drilling fluid. The material used in the current work is smart nano bentonite produced by enhancing the rheological properties of bentonite clay.|$|E

3000|$|Case 1 Seepage mud loss: For {{permeable}} rocks (excluding {{those with}} highly fractured preexisting fractures), once the mud pressure {{applied in the}} borehole {{is greater than the}} formation pore pressure (p mud > p), the mud will invade and flow into the formation through pores due to high permeability. This is the seepage mud loss, which can easily happen in permeable sandstones and limestones, particularly for the low pore pressure or depleted reservoirs. Seepage mud loss is a slow mud volume escape or loss into the formation through porous materials or small holes. Therefore, seepage loss in most cases is minimal (normally, the loss < 10  bbl/h for oil-based mud and < 25  bbl/h for water-based mud). This will have little effect on the drilling operations. Since the seepage mud loss is mainly caused by the connected pores or by formation permeability, <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>material</b> (LCM) pills can be used to block the flow path.|$|R

30|$|Lost {{circulation}} {{has been}} a serious problem while drilling {{that may lead to}} heavy financial costs in the form of lost rig time and lost mud fluid.

Despite extensive advances {{in the last couple of}} decades, <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> used today still have disadvantages such as damaging production zones, failing to seal large fractures or plugging drilling tools. Here, we propose a new class of smart expandable lost circulation material (LCM) to remotely control the expanding force and functionality of the injected LCM. Our smart LCM is made out of shape memory polymers that become activated by formation’s natural heat. Once activated, these particles can effectively seal fractures’ width without damaging pores in the production zone or plugging drilling tools. The activation temperature of the proposed LCM can be adjusted based on the formation’s temperature. We conducted a series of experiments to measure the sealing efficiency of these smart LCMs as a proof of concept study. Various slot disk sizes were used to mimic different size fractures in the formation. The API RP 13 B- 1 and 13 B- 2 have been followed as standard testing methods to evaluate this product.|$|E

This paper presents an experimental investigation to study the effect of LCM type, concentration, particle size distribution, temperature, and LCM shape on the formed seal integrity, with respect to differential pressure, at different fracture widths. The overall objective {{of this study is to}} address the effectiveness of LCM treatments in sealing fractured shales, with specific application to the over consolidated Barents Sea overburden. Three commonly used LCMs that vary in size were used to formulate and evaluate the effectiveness of nine LCM blends. Nutshell blends effectively sealed different fracture widths with high seal integrities. Examination of the formed seal under an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope revealed that this performance is due to the irregular shapes of these materials as well as their ability to deform under elevated pressure. Based on the results, it has been found that to effectively seal fractures using granular LCM treatments, the D 90 value should be equal or slightly larger than the anticipated fracture width. However, due to both the increased risk of plugging downhole tools and the availability of larger LCM, granular LCM treatments can only be used to seal fractures up to 2000  microns. With the current limitations, other unconventional treatments are required to seal fractures wider than 2000  microns.|$|E

Designing the fluid requires {{a good understanding of}} sealing mechanisms and all the parameters affecting the sealing performance. Laboratory testing apparatus is the key concept for LCM evaluation ensuring successful treatment. The high-pressure test cell containing fracture discs is an effective tool among the broadly designed apparatus. A variety of formulations has been developed from the LCM physical properties. Recently, the testing conditions such as the slot wall angles and the fracture disc thickness were found to have significant effects on the evaluation results. However, the effect of the base fluids, fluid density, types of weighting materials and aging conditions has not been addressed. In this study, two different base fluids, water-based fluids and oil-based fluids, were used to compare the base-fluid effect. Drilling fluid density was raised up using barite and/or hematite to investigate the effect of the weight agents. Barite was sieved to study the effect of fine particles on the sealing. Finally, the dynamic aging tests were conducted in LCM-treated WBF using two temperature levels (200  °F and 400  °F) and two aging periods (24 and 72  h). The results showed that the base fluids affected the sealing performance depending on the complex interaction between the solid particles and the fluids. Adding weighting agents tended to improve the seal integrity. Adding proper size of fine particles improved the LCM sealing performance. Aging conditions affected LCM properties depending on the thermal stability of the materials.|$|E
40|$|Lost {{circulation}} of drilling fluid results in higher operational expenses {{which makes it}} imperative to design the fluid, such that minimal invasion of the fluid occurs in the formation. To achieve this, <b>Lost</b> <b>Circulation</b> <b>Materials</b> (LCM) are required {{which is expected to}} seal the fractures hence, the performance of Oyster Sea-shells (Crassostrea Virginica) as a lost circulation material is being investigated knowing that it is rich in Calcium Carbonate. Sea shells were prepared, pulverized and sieved to obtain fine grain particles which were analyzed in the laboratory for various properties. A fractured zone lost circulation test procedure was employed using a medium-sized fracture at 1000 psi. pressure drop and temperature of 80 ºF. The tests were performed in triplicates and the rheological and gel strength results were obtained. It was seen that although the Oyster Sea shell is not a viscosifier, it passes API acceptability test for API acceptable range of Plastic Viscosity and Yield Point. The plastic viscosity and Yield point of the mud were compared to that of the VG Gel and the trend observed was a good indication that the Oyster Sea shell would support Wyoming bentonite. Locally sourced Oyster Sea-shell {{can be used as a}} lost circulation material as its fine-sized grades performed excellently in controlling mud loss for the water-based mud in the laboratory. The 2 : 1 blend of Oyster Sea-shell outperformed the 2 : 1 blend of coarse and medium ground walnut shells in some of the water-based drilling mud tested; hence, the Oyster sea shell is a suitable substitute for conventional LCMs...|$|E
40|$|Drilling fluid losses into {{fractured}} shales {{is a major}} challenge. Lost circulation {{treatments are}} widely applied to mitigate the losses; however, {{the effectiveness of these}} treatments is affected by different physical properties of the used <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> (LCM). This paper presents an experimental investigation to study the effect of LCM type, concentration, particle size distribution, temperature, and LCM shape on the formed seal integrity, with respect to differential pressure, at different fracture widths. The overall objective {{of this study is to}} address the effectiveness of LCM treatments in sealing fractured shales, with specific application to the over consolidated Barents Sea overburden. Three commonly used LCMs that vary in size were used to formulate and evaluate the effectiveness of nine LCM blends. Nutshell blends effectively sealed different fracture widths with high seal integrities. Examination of the formed seal under an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope revealed that this performance is due to the irregular shapes of these materials as well as their ability to deform under elevated pressure. Based on the results, it has been found that to effectively seal fractures using granular LCM treatments, the D 90 value should be equal or slightly larger than the anticipated fracture width. However, due to both the increased risk of plugging downhole tools and the availability of larger LCM, granular LCM treatments can only be used to seal fractures up to 2000 microns. With the current limitations, other unconventional treatments are required to seal fractures wider than 2000 microns...|$|E
30|$|<b>Lost</b> <b>circulation</b> {{costs are}} a {{significant}} expense in drilling oil and gas wells. Drilling anywhere in the Rumaila field, one the world’s largest oilfields, requires penetrating the Dammam formation, which is notorious for <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> issues and thus {{a great source of}} information on <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> events. This paper presents a new, more precise model to predict <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> volumes, equivalent circulation density (ECD), and rate of penetration (ROP) in the Dammam formation. A larger data set, more systematic statistical approach, and a machine-learning algorithm have produced statistical models that give a better prediction of the <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> volumes, ECD, and ROP than the previous models for events. This paper presents the new model, validates the key elements impacting <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> in the Dammam formation, and compares the predicted outcomes to those from the older model. The work previously presented by Al-Hameedi et al. ([URL] 2017 a; [URL] 2017 b) provided a platform for predicting the severity of <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> incidents in the Dammam formation. Using the new models, the predictions closely track actual field incidents of <b>lost</b> <b>circulation.</b> When new <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> events were compared with predictions from the old and new models, the new model presented a much tighter prediction of events. Three equations for optimizing operations were developed from these models focusing on the elements that have the highest degree of impact. The total flow area of the nozzles was determined to be a significant factor in the ROP model indicating that nozzle size should be chosen carefully to achieve optimal ROP. Good modeling of projected <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> events can assist in evaluating the effectiveness of new treatments for <b>lost</b> <b>circulation.</b> The Dammam formation is a significant source of <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> in a major oilfield and warrants evaluation of the effectiveness of <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> treatments. These techniques can be applied to other fields and formations to better understand the economic impact of <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> and evaluate the effectiveness of various <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> mitigation efforts.|$|R

Pipe sticking, formation damage and uncontrolled flow {{of oil and gas}} may be consequences of <b>lost</b> <b>circulation.</b> Dealing with this problem is a key factor to conduct a successful drilling operation. Estimation of <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> amount is necessary to find a solution. <b>Lost</b> <b>circulation</b> is influenced by different parameters such as mud weight, pump pressure, depth etc. Mud weight, pump pressure and flow rate of mud should be designed to prevent induced fractures and have the least amount of <b>lost</b> <b>circulation.</b> Artificial neural network is useful to find the relations of parameters with <b>lost</b> <b>circulation.</b> Genetic algorithm is applied on the achieved relations to determine the optimum mud weight, pump pressure, and flow rate. In an Iranian oil field, daily drilling reports of wells which are drilled using UBD technique are studied. Asmari formation is the most important oil reservoir of the studied field and UBD is used only in this interval. Three wells with the most, moderate and without <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> are chosen. In this article, the effect of mud weight, depth, pump pressure and flow rate of pump on <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> in UBD of Asmari formation in one of the Southwest Iranian fields is studied using drilling data and artificial neural network.

40|$|The Iceland Deep Drilling Project {{research}} well RN- 15 /IDDP- 2 at Reykjanes, Iceland, {{reached its}} target of supercritical conditions {{at a depth}} of 4. 5  km in January 2017. After only 6 days of heating, the measured bottom hole temperature was 426  °C, and the fluid pressure was 34  MPa. The southern tip of the Reykjanes peninsula is the landward extension of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in Iceland. Reykjanes is unique among Icelandic geothermal systems in that it is recharged by seawater, which has a critical point of 406  °C at 29. 8  MPa. The geologic setting and fluid characteristics at Reykjanes provide a geochemical analog that allows us to investigate the roots of a mid-ocean ridge submarine black smoker hydrothermal system. Drilling began with deepening an existing 2. 5  km deep vertical production well (RN- 15) to 3  km depth, followed by inclined drilling directed towards the main upflow zone of the system, for a total slant depth of 4659  m ([*]∼[*]  4. 5  km vertical depth). Total circulation losses of drilling fluid were encountered below 2. 5  km, which could not be cured using <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> blocking <b>materials</b> or multiple cement jobs. Accordingly, drilling continued to the total depth without return of drill cuttings. Thirteen spot coring attempts were made below 3  km depth. Rocks in the cores are basalts and dolerites with alteration ranging from upper greenschist facies to amphibolite facies, suggesting that formation temperatures at depth exceed 450  °C. High-permeability circulation-fluid loss zones (feed points or feed zones) were detected at multiple depth levels below 3  km depth to bottom. The largest circulation losses (most permeable zones) occurred between the bottom of the casing and 3. 4  km depth. Permeable zones encountered below 3. 4  km accepted less than 5...|$|R
