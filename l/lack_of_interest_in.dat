5|$|The tale's disappointing qualities {{have been}} {{ascribed}} to Potter's growing <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> writing for children, {{to pressure from}} her publisher for yet another book, and to Potter's desire to exploit the lucrative American market. Potter's artistically successful books were written for specific children; Timmy Tiptoes however was composed for Potter's amorphous, ill-defined American fanbase. By 1911, the demands of her aging parents and the business operations at her working farm, Hill Top, occupied much of Potter's time and attention {{to the exclusion of}} nearly everything else, and are accounted as some {{of the reasons for the}} author's declining artistry and her <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> producing children's books.|$|E

5|$|Alpha Flight's Northstar was {{the first}} major gay {{character}} in the Marvel universe and remains the most famous gay character in mainstream comics. Created by Marvel Comics in 1979 {{as a member of the}} original Alpha Flight superhero team, Northstar's sexual identity was hinted at early in his history, in 1983 in issues 7 and 8 of Alpha Flight, but not openly stated; his apparent <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> women was chalked up to his obsessive drive to win as a ski champion. The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992's Alpha Flight issue 106 and his outing made national headlines.|$|E

5|$|Another American {{tradition}} {{is that of}} an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, {{but not so much}} from a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln {{was born}} in Hingham, on May 15, 1749, to Enoch and Rachel (Fearing) Lincoln. His father first apprenticed him to a local blacksmith, but the boy's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> that {{business}} and clear interest in reading led to his eventual enrollment in Harvard College. He graduated in 1772, and studied law under Joseph Hawley in Northampton. When news of the Battles of Lexington and Concord reached Northampton, he volunteered for military service, but only served for a short time, marching with the local militia to Cambridge, where militia were besieging British-occupied Boston.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Federation, non-Malays were {{generally}} uninvolved in Malayan politics and nationalism, both essentially Malay in nature; being {{more interested in}} the politics of their respective homelands, non-Malays never significantly backed the Malayan Union openly but their silence was a support to it. The AMCJA, though mostly non-Malay, did not represent a large section of the non-Malay communities in Malaya. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> or loyalty to Malaya amongst the non-Malays seemed to justify ketuanan Melayu — Malay self-rule.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{returned}} to Sydney in November 1921, and was paid off into reserve in December. By this time battlecruisers built before the Battle of Jutland were considered obsolete, {{and there is}} no record of the Admiralty suggesting that Australia purchase a replacement. Moreover, {{it is unlikely that the}} Australian Government would have agreed to such a suggestion given the prevailing political and financial conditions. As the Admiralty had decided to phase out 12-inch guns and had stopped the manufacture of shells for these weapons shortly after the war, it would have been necessary to replace Australias main armament once the Navy's stock of shells reached their expiry date given that it was not possible to produce replacement shells in Australia. This was also not financially feasible for the government, particularly given the RAN's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> retaining the ship.|$|E

The convention was thrown into chaos when a widely known agreement between Stone and Goebel – designed to get Hardin {{out of the race}} – broke down. As balloting continued over the next four days (Sunday excepted) with no candidate receiving a majority, Brown continued to receive a few votes on each ballot. Finally, the convention delegates decided to drop the candidate with the lowest vote total until one candidate received a majority; this resulted in the nomination of Goebel a few ballots later.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, women's {{football}} was a niche sport in Germany and was frowned upon. When the DFB appointed Gero Bisanz to coach the newly founded women's national team, he was initially very reluctant about his assignment and feared it would harm his reputation. Winning the 1989 European Championship was the team's first international success, but it had little lasting effect on their popularity. As a gift for the first European trophy, every player received a tea set, which is often cited {{as an example of}} male chauvinism and general <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the women's national team at that time. This attitude within the German Football Association has changed considerably in the last two decades, in particular during the term of Theo Zwanziger as DFB president, an outspoken supporter of women's football.|$|E
5|$|In October 1776, {{at the age}} of 17, Wilberforce went up to St John's College, Cambridge. The {{deaths of}} his {{grandfather}} and uncle in 1777 had left him independently wealthy and as a result he had little inclination or need to apply himself to serious study. Instead he immersed himself in the social round of student life and pursued a hedonistic lifestyle enjoying cards, gambling and late-night drinking sessions – although he found the excesses of some of his fellow students distasteful. Witty, generous and an excellent conversationalist, Wilberforce was a popular figure. He made many friends including the more studious future Prime Minister William Pitt. Despite his lifestyle and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> studying he managed to pass his examinations and was awarded a B.A. in 1781 and an M.A. in 1788.|$|E

After the death of Corning and the retirement of Congressman Sam Stratton, the political environment changes. Long-term office holders became rare in the 1980s. Local media began following the drama surrounding county politics (specifically that of the newly created county executive position); the loss of Corning (and eventually the machine) led to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> city politics.
