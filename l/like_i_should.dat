500|$|In August, Stefani {{filed for}} divorce from her husband Gavin Rossdale after almost {{thirteen}} years of marriage. In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't feel right. [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> do something in music, but what was I going to do? There wasn't enough time. So I {{tried to make a}} record where I was just kind of involved—which is how {{a lot of people do}} it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not feel right and she needed to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think I have enough for probably two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, because I feel like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, but I want to keep writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team. The album was completed in January 2016. Stefani revealed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on February 25 that [...] "'four of five' songs" [...] were written in the previous month.|$|E
2500|$|Baldelli {{decided to}} retire {{soon after his}} medical {{condition}} forced him off the Rays' roster during the 2010 ALDS. However, Rays' executive Andrew Friedman advised him {{to take some time}} to be sure he really wanted to end his playing career. After three months of consideration, Baldelli officially announced his retirement on January 26, 2011 at 29 years old, stating that due to his illness, [...] "I physically don't feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be playing anymore." [...] He remained in the Rays organization as a [...] "special adviser" [...] working in scouting and player development.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{successful}} Stanley Cup winning campaign with the Pittsburgh Penguins where he scored 10 goals and 22 {{points in the}} playoffs, he was left off the American roster of the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. Following the elimination of Team USA after a 4-2 loss to Team Canada, Kessel tweeted [...] "Just sitting around the house tonight w my dog. Felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be doing something important, but couldn't {{put my finger on}} it." [...] This was interpreted by several Team USA players and personnel, including Dean Lombardi, John Tortorella, David Backes, Zach Parise, and Derek Stepan as Kessel jabbing following his snub. Kessel stated that his comments were not directed at anyone, and that he didn't mean any disrespect towards anyone.|$|E

2500|$|In an April 15 {{interview}} with Elizabeth Vargas for ABC's 20/20, Lane stated: [...] "I didn't really specify {{anything in my}} contract about getting onscreen credit or anything ... I didn't do the movie to get fame or recognition or anything." [...] She added, [...] "I'm not speaking because I feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be heralded .... I'm speaking because [...] are completely lying {{about the amount of}} dancing Natalie did in the movie. When those incorrect things are coming out, and they threaten the entire principle of ballet, then I feel like I need to say something." [...] When Vargas asked if it is possible that both interpretations of the [...] "math" [...] can be correct, Lane responded: [...] "It's possible, like I said, if you're counting the close-ups of her face as actual dancing shots. But I don't call close-ups of her face actual dancing." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 1, 2008, Redden {{signed a}} six-year, $39 million {{contract}} as an unrestricted free agent with the New York Rangers. Redden's performance continued to decline in New York, where he faced considerable criticism — one {{writer for the}} New York Post even called the contract [...] "the worst {{in the history of}} the NHL, if not in the history of hard-cap pro sports." [...] On September 25, 2010, the Rangers placed Redden on waivers in part due to the defenceman's declining play. The move also allowed the Rangers to fit under salary cap. Speaking in 2013 on his stint with the Rangers, Redden said, [...] "I think maybe making that money there and being the player I am… I felt like the first little while, things were going pretty good, and then they kind of fell off. I felt like I wasn’t doing enough, and <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have been doing more. Once I started feeling that way, I think I just got away from the things that made me successful. Things just kind of snowballed from there." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a display}} of Parker's work ethic, work on the next Tame Impala album Lonerism had already started before Innerspeaker was even {{released}}. Lonerism was released on 5 October 2012 to widespread critical acclaim, winning many Album of the Year awards {{from the likes of}} NME Magazine, Rolling Stone Magazine and Triple J. Lonerism marks an extension of Parker's music, featuring synths and poppier melodies, and also a more lavish, lush and expansive sound. Commenting on the new-found sound, Parker said that [...] " [...] will be the kind of music that I felt as though I wanted to make during Innerspeaker, but I felt that it {{was too much of a}} jump. Back when I was doing Innerspeaker, I felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> make an album with only guitars, and use no synths, because I felt like it was a compromise to what we do. But I now know that it's not." [...] At the ARIA Music Awards of 2015 he won two trophies, Engineer of the Year and Producer of the Year, for his work on Tame Impala's Currents (July 2015); the group won three further categories at the ceremony: Album of the Year, Best Group and Best Rock Album.|$|E

And yet, during the first three days I never allowed him to enter a hut or other dwelling. If he could pass muster anywhere during his early novitiate it would be in small inns and on the road; so to these places we confined ourselves. Yes, he certainly did the best he could, but what of that? He didn't improve a bit that I could see.|$|E

Don't come with any idea about making me nervous or uncomfortable. I am not nervous by nature, thank Heaven, and I won't--I positively won't (do you hear, dear Captain Benyon?)--be uncomfortable.

60|$|It {{was not a}} tempting-looking cheese. It was an unhealthy, sad-looking cheese. It {{looked like}} a cheese that had seen trouble. In {{appearance}} it resembled putty more than anything else. It even tasted like putty--at least, <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> imagine putty would taste. To this hour I am not positive {{that it was not}} putty. The garnishing was even more remarkable than the cheese. All the way round the plate were piled articles that I had never before seen at a dinner, and that I do not ever want to see there again. There was a little heap of split-peas, three or four remarkably small potatoes--at least, I suppose they were potatoes; if not, they were pea-nuts boiled soft,--some caraway-seeds, a very young-looking fish, apparently of the stickleback breed, and some red paint. It was quite a little dinner all to itself.|$|E

We have talked together a great deal, and he seems to like the things I <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> see plenty of court life and high society, for he will soon be transferred from this legation, and if I take him I shall go to some foreign capital. He is very sharp and ambitious, and I have no doubt that some day he will be looked upon as a distinguished foreigner. Now, as it is the ambition of many American girls to marry distinguished foreigners, this alliance is certainly worthy of due consideration." ...|$|E

'Wasted it, mother, and went to prison after.' 'Who took you out of prison?' 'Brother George, ma'am, he took me out of prison; and now I'm come back, having done no good for myself, with no profession, no prospects, no nothing--only to look after negroes, and be scolded at home; or {{to go to sleep}} at sermons; or to play at cards, and drink, and fight cocks at the taverns about.' How can I look the gentlemen of the country in the face? I'm ashamed to go home in this way, I say. I must and will do something! What shall I do, Hetty? Ah! what shall I do?" ...|$|E
