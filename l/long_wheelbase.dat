5|$|The 2-6-4 wheel {{arrangement}} {{was not in}} common use in Great Britain at this time, as many railway companies operated routes that required locomotives with greater fuel capacity, or short branch lines that necessitated smaller locomotives. The 2-6-4 tank engine design had only been used once before for standard gauge locomotives in Britain, on the Great Central Railway's 1Bclass freight locomotives of 1914. However, the configuration was ideal for the SECR, because of its shorter mainlines, and allowed for a <b>long</b> <b>wheelbase</b> with a leading axle to permit greater stability at speed on track curves. The tightness of the curves on the former LCDR mainlines had constrained the size of locomotives operating on the SECR, {{as they had been}} hastily erected during the nineteenth century to compete with those of the South Eastern Railway (SER). The longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than a 4-4-0, giving sufficient power to avoid double-heading of locomotives on heavier trains.|$|E

25|$|The design, using {{identical}} 6,200 horsepower (4,600kW) power cars at {{each end}} which operate on a voltage of 11,000 volts AC, and either 25 or 60 Hz frequency, derives several components from the TGV, such as the third-generation TGV's traction system (including the four asynchronous AC motors per power car, rectifiers, inverters, and regenerative braking), the trucks/bogies structure (a <b>long</b> <b>wheelbase</b> dual transom H frame welded steel with outboard mounted tapered roller bearings), the brake discs (although {{there are only three}} per axle, versus four on the TGV), and crash energy management techniques to control structural deformation {{in the event of an}} accident.|$|E
25|$|Between 1969 and 1971, TVR {{released}} {{several new}} models. The Tuscan V6, {{equipped with the}} 3.0L Ford Essex V6, was intended to fill the performance gap between the four-cylinder Vixens and the V8 models. The <b>long</b> <b>wheelbase</b> widebody Tuscan V8 was built to address the cramped interior dimensions of the car, but was not commercially successful and {{only a very small}} number were produced. The Vixen S3 incorporated several minor updates to the Vixen S2, which had continued to be successful. The new 2500 model was fitted with the Triumph 2.5L inline-six engine. Working together in 1971, Martin Lilley and Mike Bigland created yet another new model, the TVR 1300. This used the 1.3L engine from the Triumph Spitfire and was intended to offer an inexpensive model option that was also cheaper to insure.|$|E
25|$|With its ancestry {{going back}} to the horse bus days of the 1880s, Chelverton Road Garage was {{converted}} to a motor-bus garage in 1912. The garage is well hidden in a side road with a modest frontage, yet it has an allocation of 112. It has been modernised twice, firstly in 1935 and then again in 1985. The garage was well known for being allocated the pre-war RTs in 1940 which displaced the STLs. During the war the garage was underutilised and was used to store de-licensed buses. Renamed Putney in 1963 after the closure of Putney Bridge garage (F) it started to receive both short and <b>long</b> <b>wheelbase</b> AEC Routemasters for its central London routes. The Routemasters remained at the garage until July 2005 when both the 14 and 22 were converted to low floor one-person-operated buses.|$|E

Both saloon and estate versions of the facelifted model carried the same model designation on their bootlid, i.e. the T was no longer used for estate versions. In the UK post-facelift diesels were E 250 Diesel (saloon only) and E 300 Diesel (saloon & estate) models.

500|$|Milton W. Raymond built a long low two-wheel {{steering}} bicycle, called [...] "X-2", {{with various}} steering mechanisms {{to control the}} two wheels independently. [...] Steering motions included [...] "balance", in which both wheels move together to steer the tire contacts under the center of mass; and [...] "true circle", in which the wheels steer equally in opposite directions and thus steering the bicycle without substantially changing the lateral position of the tire contacts relative {{to the center of}} mass. [...] X-2 was also able to go [...] "crabwise" [...] with the wheels parallel but out of line with the frame, for instance with the front wheel near the roadway center line and rear wheel near the curb. [...] "Balance" [...] steering allowed easy balancing despite <b>long</b> <b>wheelbase</b> and low center of mass, but no self-balancing ("no hands") configuration was discovered. [...] True circle, as expected, was essentially impossible to balance, as steering does not correct for misalignment of the tire patch and center of mass. [...] Crabwise cycling at angles tested up to about 45Â° did not show a tendency to fall over, even under braking. [...] X-2 is mentioned in passing in Whitt and Wilson's Bicycling Science 2nd edition.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} years of preservation, the line {{struggled}} to operate using the original rolling stock. When the line was taken over in 1950 Dolgoch was the only operating locomotive and it was apparent that it was in need of a major overhaul. To enable operations to continue two further steam locomotives, Nos.3 and 4, were purchased from the recently closed Corris Railway in 1951 and named Sir Haydn and Edward Thomas respectively. Because both railways were built to the unusual gauge of [...] it was relatively easy to adapt the Corris locomotives to work on the Talyllyn. No.3 became the first new locomotive to travel on the railway for over 80years in 1951, but it frequently derailed, and on inspection {{it turned out that the}} Talyllyn track was laid approximately half an inch (13mm) wider than the official gauge, a deliberate policy by the old company to accommodate the <b>long</b> <b>wheelbase</b> of Talyllyn. Both Talyllyn and Dolgoch had unusually wide wheel treads that allowed them to stay on the wide-of-gauge track. This problem was eventually cured by relaying the railway to its correct gauge and altering Talyllyns trailing wheels to allow them to swivel horizontally, shortening the locomotive's fixed wheelbase. No.4 was unserviceable when it arrived, but John Alcock, the chairman of the Hunslet Engine Company, was a member of the Preservation Society and had No.4 overhauled free of charge at his works. No.4 then began service on the railway in 1952 and worked the majority of the trains that season.|$|E
