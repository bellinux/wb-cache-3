25|$|This {{new process}} is being {{explored}} {{for use as}} a laser lightning rod and as a means to trigger lightning bolts from clouds for natural <b>lightning</b> <b>channel</b> studies, for artificial atmospheric propagation studies, as a substitute for conventional radio antennas, for applications associated with electric welding and machining, for diverting power from high-voltage capacitor discharges, for directed-energy weapon applications employing electrical conduction through a ground return path, and electronic jamming.|$|E
40|$|In present work, {{we propose}} the {{analysis}} method of lightning {{based on the}} color analysis. We analyzed the digital still images in which the cloud-to-ground (CG) and intracloud (IC) lightning flashes are shown. Applying some digital image processing techniques, we extracted <b>lightning</b> <b>channels.</b> Then, the correlated color temperature (CCT) of the extracted <b>lightning</b> <b>channels</b> was obtained by mapping digital pixels of the extracted <b>lightning</b> <b>channels</b> to CIE 1931 xy-chromaticity diagram. Our {{results indicate that the}} CCT of <b>lightning</b> <b>channels</b> changes spatially. Furthermore, it suggests that the energy of <b>lightning</b> <b>channels</b> changes spatially.

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} work {{was performed on}} emission of photons from the air within and above thunderclouds and within <b>lightning</b> <b>channels.</b> Predictions were made of the telltale emissions from ionized nitrogen molecules and these emissions were recorded. The measurements will be utilized to help {{to understand the nature}} of thundercloud-produced airglow...|$|R
25|$|Once a {{conductive}} channel bridges the air {{gap between the}} negative charge excess in the cloud and the positive surface charge excess below, {{there is a large}} drop in resistance across the <b>lightning</b> <b>channel.</b> Electrons accelerate rapidly as a result in a zone beginning at the point of attachment, which expands across the entire leader network {{at a fraction of the}} speed of light. This is the 'return stroke' and it is the most luminous and noticeable part of the lightning discharge.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{electrostatic}} discharge of terrestrial lightning superheats {{the air to}} plasma temperatures {{along the length of}} the discharge channel in a short duration, kinetic theory dictates gaseous molecules undergo a rapid increase in pressure and thus expand outward from the lightning creating a shock wave audible as thunder. Since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but {{along the length of the}} lightning's path, the sound origin's varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect. Perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry of the <b>lightning</b> <b>channel,</b> by acoustic echoing from terrain, and by the typically multiple-stroke characteristic of the lightning strike.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} why multiple return strokes utilize the same <b>lightning</b> <b>channel,</b> {{one needs to}} understand the behavior of positive leaders, which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader's connection with the ground. Positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative leaders do. For reasons not well understood, bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on {{the tips of the}} decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re-ionize the leader network. These leaders, also called recoil leaders, usually decay shortly after their formation. When they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network, a return stroke-like process occurs and a dart leader travels across all, or a portion of the length of the original leader. The dart leaders making connections with the ground is what causes a majority of subsequent return strokes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lightning</b> <b>channels</b> are {{considered}} as resonant wave guides {{in which only}} standing resonant wave modes can be excited. Two types of discharging currents develop. Type 1 is an aperiodic wave; type 2 is a damped oscillation. The electromagnetic radiation field of both types of currents is calculated and compared with the observation...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} study on lightning-induced {{voltages}} on overhead lines produced by tortuous <b>lightning</b> <b>channels,</b> by using a recently developed tool called CiLIV (Andreotti et al. 2015). CiLIV, initially developed for straight and vertical channels, is here extended to account for tortuosity. High-resolution stereoscopic images of six triggered <b>lightning</b> <b>channels</b> have been 3 -D digitized and used as input data for CiLIV. The result is that tortuosity, usually ignored in lightning-induced voltage assessment, can instead play a significant role: an attempt is made in characterizing and quantifying these effects. It is shown that, in contrast to other lightning parameters, like channel-base peak current, which are log-normally distributed and generate log-normally distributed induced voltages too, tortuosity generates normally distributed induced voltages. It is also shown that these voltages can deviate up to 23 % (relative standard deviation) from the mean value...|$|R
25|$|Lightning {{discharges}} {{are considered}} to be the primary natural source of Schumann resonance excitation; <b>lightning</b> <b>channels</b> behave like huge antennas that radiate electromagnetic energy at frequencies below about 100kHz. These signals are very weak at large distances from the lightning source, but the Earth–ionosphere waveguide behaves like a resonator at ELF frequencies and amplifies the spectral signals from lightning at the resonance frequencies.|$|R
2500|$|Cloud-to-ground (CG) {{lightning}} {{is either}} positive or negative, {{as defined by}} the direction of the conventional electric current from cloud to ground. [...] Most CG lightning is negative, meaning that a negative charge is transferred to ground and electrons travel downward along the <b>lightning</b> <b>channel.</b> The reverse happens in a positive CG flash, where electrons travel upward along the <b>lightning</b> <b>channel</b> and a positive charge is transferred to the ground. Positive lightning is less common than negative lightning, and on average makes up less than 5% of all lightning strikes.|$|E
50|$|Another {{hypothetical}} {{mechanism is}} that TGFs are produced within the thundercloud itself, {{either in the}} strong electric fields near the <b>lightning</b> <b>channel</b> or in the static fields that exist over large volumes of the cloud. These mechanisms rely on extreme activity of the <b>lightning</b> <b>channel</b> to start the process (Carlson et al. 2010) or on strong feedback to allow even small-scale random events to trigger production.|$|E

30|$|Lightning {{depends on}} a number of factors like type (i.e., {{positive}} or negative discharges), first or subsequent strokes, direction, channel shape and so forth. Each feature is characterized by its uncertainty; the phenomenon is typically analyzed on a statistical basis, corroborated by means of extensive measurements collected in instrumented towers [40, 41, 42, 43] or in artificially-initiated <b>lightning</b> <b>channels</b> [44, 45].|$|R

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{made with}} the Baksan air shower array discovered two types of pre-lightning enhancements of the soft component of cosmic rays.

5000|$|Lightning strikes are short-lived, high-intensity {{electrical}} discharges {{that can}} reach temperatures five times hotter than {{the surface of}} the Sun. As a result, as a <b>lightning</b> <b>channel</b> travels through the air, ionization occurs, forming nitrogen-oxide (NOx) compounds within the <b>lightning</b> <b>channel.</b> [...] Global NOx production as a result of lightning is around 1 - 20 Tg N yr−1. [...] Some studies have implied that lightning activity may be the [...] "greatest contributor to the global nitrogen budget", even larger than the burning of fossil fuels. [...] With anywhere between 1500 and 2000 thunderstorms and millions of lightning strikes occurring daily around the Earth, it is understandable that lightning activity plays a vital role in nitrogen fixation. [...] While nitrogen oxide compounds are produced as a <b>lightning</b> <b>channel</b> travels toward the ground, some of those compounds are transferred to the geosphere via wet or dry deposition. [...] Variations of nitrogen in terrestrial and oceanic environments impact primary production and other biological processes. [...] Changes in primary production can impact not only the carbon cycle, but also the climate system.|$|E

40|$|Photographs from a NASA U- 2 {{airplane}} {{flying over}} nocturnal thunderstorms show frequent lightning {{activity in the}} upper part of the cloud. In some cases, unobscured segments of <b>lightning</b> <b>channels</b> 1 km or longer are visible in clear air around and above the cloud. Multiple images of <b>lightning</b> <b>channels</b> indicate multiple discharges in the same channel. Photographs taken through a diffraction grating show that the lightning has a spectrum similar to that observed in the lower troposphere. Lightning spectra obtained with a slitless line-scan spectrometer show strong singly ionized nitrogen emissions at 463. 0 and 500. 5 nm. Field changes measured with an electric field-change meter correlate with pulses measured with a photocell optical system. Optical signals corresponding to dart leader, return stroke, and continuing current events are readily distinguished in the scattered light emerging from the cloud surface. The variation of light intensity with time in lightning events is consistent with predicted modification of optical lightning signals by clouds. It appears that satellite based optical sensor measurements cannot provide reliable information on current rise times in return strokes. On the other hand, discrimination between cloud-to-ground and intracloud flashes and the counting of ground strokes is possible using the optical pulse pairs which have been identified with leader, return-stroke events in the cloud-to-ground flashes studied...|$|R
30|$|The {{solidified}} melt spherules were rare, small, and porous. While the porosity, {{as mentioned}} above, {{may be a}} weak argument against formation in nebular lightnings and one could be tempted to attribute the small size to different length scales in experimental and real situations, an analysis of energetic efficiency shows what “rarity” means in this context. The ratio of energy consumed for melting spherules devided by the discharge energy, yielded values between 0.006 % and 0.06 %, depending on the material. Even considering the ultimate source of energy the protoplanetary disk had, which is its potential energy, it is by orders of magnitude too small to explain chondrule formation by nebular lightning. Furthermore, the destruction of aggregates in the gas discharge is a strong argument against chondrule formation inside hypothetical nebular <b>lightning</b> <b>channels.</b> Loosely-bound aggregates would not have survived the even more violent conditions in possible nebular lightning than in the experiments. These are strong and independent arguments against chondrule formation inside nebular <b>lightning</b> <b>channels.</b> However, one {{must be careful not}} to misunderstand these arguments. Not only they do not exclude the possibility of nebular lightnings and whatever effect they may have had to dust aggregates, but also they do not exclude that nebular lightning melted chondrule precursors by some mechanism (e.g. radiation or hot gas) outside the discharge channel.|$|R
2500|$|Smooth <b>channel</b> <b>lightning</b> is an {{informal}} term {{referring to a}} type of cloud-to-ground lightning strike that has no visible branching and appears like a line with smooth curves {{as opposed to the}} jagged appearance of most <b>lightning</b> <b>channels.</b> They are a form of positive lightning generally observed in or near the convective regions of severe thunderstorms in the north central United States. It is theorized that severe thunderstorms in this region obtain an [...] "inverted tripole" [...] charge structure in which the main positive charge region is located below the main negative charge region instead of above it, and as a result these thunderstorms generate predominantly positive cloud-to-ground lightning. The term [...] "smooth channel lightning" [...] is also sometimes attributed to upward ground-to-cloud lightning flashes, which are generally negative flashes initiated by upward positive leaders from tall structures.|$|R
5000|$|Fulgurites {{are formed}} when {{lightning}} strikes the ground, fusing and vitrifying mineral grains. The peak temperatures within a <b>lightning</b> <b>channel</b> {{are known to}} exceed 30,000 K, with sufficient pressure to produce planar deformation features, or [...] "shock lamellae" [...] in SiO2 polymorphs. [...] "Artificial fulgurites" [...] can also be produced when the controlled arcing of electricity into a fusable medium. Downed high voltage power lines have produced blue, fulgurite-like lechatelierites, colored by copper from the power lines, themselves.|$|E
5000|$|The {{visible part}} of a <b>lightning</b> <b>channel</b> has a typical length of about 5 km [...] Another part of {{comparable}} length may be hidden in the cloud and may have a significant horizontal branch. Evidently, the dominant wavelength of the electromagnetic waves of R- and K-strokes is much larger than their channel lengths. The physics of electromagnetic wave propagation within the channel must thus be derived from full wave theory, because the ray concept breaks down.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cause of}} thunder {{has been the}} subject of centuries of {{speculation}} and scientific inquiry. The first recorded theory is attributed to the Greek philosopher Aristotle in the fourth century BC, and an early speculation was that it was caused by the collision of clouds. Subsequently, numerous other theories were proposed. By the mid-19th century, the accepted theory was that lightning produced a vacuum. In the 20th century a consensus evolved that thunder must begin with a shock wave in the air due to the sudden thermal expansion of the plasma in the <b>lightning</b> <b>channel.</b> [...] The temperature inside the <b>lightning</b> <b>channel,</b> measured by spectral analysis, varies during its 50 μs existence, rising sharply from an initial temperature of about 20,000 K to about 30,000 K, then dropping away gradually to about 10,000 K. The average is about 20400 K. [...] This heating causes a rapid outward expansion, impacting the surrounding cooler air at a speed faster than sound would otherwise travel. The resultant outward-moving pulse is a shock wave,similar in principle to the shock wave formed by an explosion, or at the front of a supersonic aircraft.|$|E
40|$|A theory {{showing that}} errors in {{lightning}} magnetic direction finding due to nonvertical source orientations are minimized by detecting the field from {{the lowest possible}} channel section is presented. For 99 cloud-to-ground <b>lightning</b> <b>channels</b> photographed in Arizona, 45 exhibited a bottom few hundred meters within about 8 deg of the vertical, the standard deviation {{of the distribution of}} lower-channel tilt angles being about 18 deg. These experimental results, coupled with theory, suggest that if a wideband gated direction finder is used, polarization errors due to nonvertical sources can be kept less than 1 deg for lightning beyond 10 km...|$|R
40|$|Lightning swept-flash {{attachment}} {{patterns and}} the associated flight conditions were recorded from 1980 - 1985 during 1378 thunderstorm penetrations and 690 direct strikes with a NASA F- 106 B research airplane.

The altitudes, ambient temperatures, and the relative turbulence and precipitation levels at which the strikes occurred also are summarized and discussed, with an emphasis on the differences between high and low altitude strikes...|$|R
40|$|Observations of nocturnal {{thunderstorms}} {{from three}} aerial cameras flown {{at an altitude}} of 20 km and at an airspeed of 200 m/s are analyzed and compared with previous ground-based observations. Both diffuse illumination in the cloud and unobscured segments of <b>lightning</b> <b>channels</b> a kilometer or longer in clear air around and above the cloud are observed. A similarity is noted to exist between the airborne and the ground-based lightning spectra registered. It is further asserted that discrimination between cloud-to-ground and intracloud flashes and the counting of ground strokes can be achieved through the use of optical pulse pairs identified with leader return-stroke events in the cloud-to-ground flashes studied...|$|R
5000|$|Smooth channel {{lightning}} {{are positive}} cloud to ground lightning strikes where the forward stroke originates {{from the ground}} upwards to the cloud. The smooth channel is in the lower section of the <b>lightning</b> <b>channel</b> but should branch higher up (not visible as the [...] "branching" [...] is inside the cloud). Large supercells generate tremendous areas of positively charged cloud material (thick anvil) and wind shear prevents excessive negative strokes as with [...] "normal" [...] thunderstorms. Downdrafts, such as the forward flank downdraft (FFD), bring the positively charged cloud material closer to the ground, where such lightning occurs.|$|E
50|$|The steady {{electric}} discharging {{currents in}} a <b>lightning</b> <b>channel</b> cause {{a series of}} incoherent impulses in the whole frequency range, the amplitudes of which decreases approximately with the inverse frequency. In the ELF-range, technical noise from 50 or 60 Hz, natural noise from the magnetosphere, etc. dominates. In the VLF-range, there are the coherent impulses from R- and K-strokes, appearing out of the background noise. Beyond about 100 kHz, the noise amplitude {{becomes more and more}} incoherent. In addition, technical noise from electric motors, ignition systems of motor cars, etc., are superimposed. Finally, beyond the high frequency band (3-30 MHz) extraterrestrial noise (noise of galactic origin, solar noise) dominates.|$|E

5000|$|Detecting {{lightning}} {{activity in}} the geologic record can be difficult, given the instantaneous nature of lightning strikes in general. However, fulgurite, a glassy tube-like, crust-like, or irregular mineraloid that forms when lightning fuses soil, quartz sands, clay, rock, biomass, or caliche is prevalent in electrically-active regions around the globe and provides evidence of not only past lightning activity, but also patterns of convection. [...] Since <b>lightning</b> <b>channels</b> carry an electric current to the ground, lightning can produce magnetic fields as well. While lightning-magnetic anomalies can provide evidence of lightning activity in a region, these anomalies are often problematic for those examining the magnetic record of rock types because they disguise the natural magnetic fields present.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{lightning}} produces NO x {{as a result of the}} high temperatures in discharge channels. Since most viable proposed electrification mechanisms involve ice crystals, it is reasonable to assume that <b>lightning</b> discharge <b>channels</b> frequently pass through fields of ice particles of various kinds. We address the question of whether ice crystals may serve as catalysts for the production of NO x by lightning discharges. If so, and if the effect is large, it would need to be taken into account in estimates of global NO x production by lightning. In this study, we make a series of plausible assumptions about the temperature and concentration of reactant species in the environment of discharges and we postulate a mechanism by which ice crystals are able to adsorb nitrogen atoms. We then compare production rates between uncatalyzed and catalyzed reactions at 2000 K, 3000 K, and 4000 K, which are reasonable temperatures in <b>lightning</b> <b>channels</b> as they cool down. Catalyzed NO production rates are greater at 2000 K, whereas uncatalyzed production rates are greater at 4000 K. This effect may be relevant to the question of the relative importance of cloud-to-ground and in-cloud lightning for NO x production...|$|R
