50|$|Flight {{testing of}} the {{aircraft}} began in 1946 at Namao, Edmonton, flown by S/L. Robert Kronfeld, A.F.C. RAF initially and continued by S/L. E. L. Baudoux, D.S.O., D.F.C., F/L. G. S. Phripp and F/L. G. A. Lee. Mr. T.E.Stephenson was in overall charge of the flying operations as well as scientific observations in the starboard cockpit.Ground handling of the glider {{was found to be}} good, using the differential brakes. Launches were carried out as aero-tows behind an RCAF Douglas Dakota with a 350 ft nylon tow-rope, at a normal towing speed of 100 mph, but tows at 140 mph were found to pose no difficulties.Flight testing was carried out predominantly in the glide after a tow to between 6,000 ft and 10,000 ft, testing being terminated at 4,000 ft to allow positioning for entering the <b>landing</b> <b>circuit.</b> Flight characteristics were found to be good with the exception of poor yaw control at low speeds.|$|R

Carey and the remnants of the British fighter forces flew to Magway. Carey was ordered to fly to Calcutta to garner supplies and reinforcements. Unable to take one of the few, and now precious Hurricanes, he found an old Tiger Moth instead. Carey and a junior pilot flew it to Akyab. Upon reaching the airfield Carey found a Vickers Victoria. He sent the young pilot back with the Moth while he completed his journey in the Victoria, now crammed with the families of Indian Army officers fleeing the Japanese advance. Carey learned that the mission was fruitless. In his absence the Magway base had been bombed and all the Hurricanes had been lost. He ordered the wing to retreat into China. Carey received the bar to his DFC while in Calcutta. It was gazetted on 24 March 1942. For the rest of 1942, Carey and his wing remained based in India, ready to contest Japanese aerial incursions. On the ground, the frontline had stabilised and the squadron received a handful of Hurricanes.|$|R

The company had several notable contracts with Raven Moon Entertainment, Inc, Ingram Entertainment Holdings Inc. and Baker & Taylor. Under its contract with Raven Moon Entertainment, Inc., it purchased DVDs such as Gina D's Kids Club, Sing A Long With Gina, and Smile-Ability, and distributed them to major retail and video stores such as Family Video, Premiere Video, Blockbuster Video, Costco, Hollywood Video, Best Buy, Ingram, Music <b>Land,</b> Borders, <b>Circuit</b> City, Sam's Club, K-mart, Wal-Mart, Sun Coast, Albertsons, Kroger and County Market. Improved technology such as inexpensive computer software, cameras and other equipment helped to lower production costs, enabling many filmmakers without significant financial backing to produce films, especially for the direct-to-video or direct-to-television markets. Pro-Active Entertainment Group was among the distribution leaders for these new markets. Video recording, once viewed as a threat, {{proved to be a}} new source of income for home entertainment distributors. In addition to new releases, distributors re-mastered and re-released older films.
