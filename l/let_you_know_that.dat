500|$|... "Next to You" [...] is a R and pop song. The song has lyrics about a relationship, but Eliot Glazer of MTV Buzzworthy {{said that}} the song also {{contained}} inspirational lyrics. It features [...] "digitized" [...] violins. According to the sheet music at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 116beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major with Bieber and Brown's vocal ranges spanning from the low-note of G3 to the high-note of C6. The song features the chord progression of E–B–Cm–A. Nadia Noir of WNOW-FM said the song was a hybrid of a [...] "dance-jam" [...] and [...] "love-song." [...] Furthermore, AOL Music's Charley Rogulewski called the song a [...] "dreamy pop love song." [...] The song sees Brown and Bieber trading verses and the chorus in lyrics like [...] "I'll be there when you're insecure/ <b>Let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you're always lovely/ Girl, because {{you are the only}} thing that I got right now." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{receiving}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} the critics, the country-rock style of Sweetheart of the Rodeo {{was such a}} radical departure from the band's previous sound that large sections of the group's counterculture following were alienated by its contents, resulting in the lowest sales of any Byrds album up to that point. Barry Gifford, in the August 1968 edition of Rolling Stone magazine, said of the album: [...] "The new Byrds do not sound like Buck Owens & his Buckaroos. They aren't that good. The material they've chosen to record, or rather, the way they perform the material, is simple, relaxed and folky. It's not pretentious, it's pretty. The musician-ship is excellent." [...] Gifford added that [...] "The Byrds have made an interesting album. It's really very uninvolved and not a difficult record to listen to. It ought to make the 'Easy-Listening' charts. 'Bringing it all back home' has never been an easy thing to do." [...] Rolling Stone praised the album in its September 1968 issue, with Jon Landau writing: [...] "The Byrds, in doing country as country, show just how powerful and relevant unadorned country music is to the music of today." [...] Landau added that [...] "they leave just enough rock in the drums to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> they can still play rock & roll." [...] In a 1969 article for The New York Times, Robert Christgau described Sweetheart of the Rodeo as [...] "a bittersweet tribute to country music".|$|E
500|$|The band's overall {{low profile}} in 2008 was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} due to them spending time working on their second album. However, in December 2008, Delorentos explained in their MySpace blog that a potential record deal had fallen through due to the prospective label encountering financial problems. Added to this, the collapse of Pinnacle, their distribution company, denied the band a chance to release their album in the United Kingdom. Their blog entry stated that [...] "these are strange times for everyone, and for us in the music industry {{there has been a lot}} of uncertainty. It just happened that our opportunity coincided with this extraordinary time." [...] After performing a number of shows with fellow Dubliners Director, Delorentos announced their break-up on 17 February 2009. The split came about after Yourell decided to leave the band due to his desire to [...] "do other things". A MySpace entry stated: [...] "It's with a very heavy heart that we have to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Ronan has decided to leave the band. He feels its best for him to move on and do other things. The three of us will still be making music and will let you know about what happens next". However, they still planned to record their second album, believed to be titled You Can Make Sound, in March 2009 – it would contain all the songs they had written in the previous year – and play [...] "a gig or two" [...] as part of a farewell tour. The band's farewell tour includes shows in Whelan's in Dublin and Cyprus Avenue in Cork. Reaction to the split was generally one of shock – The Kinetiks were amongst the neighbouring bands they had influenced, Jacqui Carroll attributed her discovery of Irish music to an early Delorentos show, whilst blogger UnaRocks, John Walshe of State, Jonnie Craig and others had recently been championing the band's sound. On 22 April 2009, the band announced they would not split after all, citing a newfound excitement for recording as their reason. Yourell later explained that the band signing away their independent stance only to be let down by their record company had [...] "knocked us out of our stride" [...] and had led to him considering his future.|$|E

2500|$|The Battle of France began {{less than}} two months after Reynaud came to office. France was badly mauled by the initial attack in early May 1940, and Paris was threatened. On 15 May, five days after the {{invasion}} began, Reynaud contacted Churchill and famously remarked, [...] "We have been defeated... we are beaten; we have lost the battle.... The front is broken near Sedan." [...] Indeed, such was the situation regarding equipment and morale that Reynaud received a postcard found on the body of an officer who had committed suicide in Le Mans. It stated: [...] "I am killing myself Mr President to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> all my men were brave, but one cannot send men to fight tanks with rifles." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the months}} after the {{severity}} of his illness became apparent, Atwater said he had converted to Roman Catholicism, through the help of Father John Hardon And, {{in an act of}} repentance, Atwater issued a number of public and written letters to individuals to whom he had been opposed to during his political career. In a June 28, 1990, letter to Tom Turnipseed, he stated, [...] "It {{is very important to me}} that I <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> out of everything that has happened in my career, one of the low points remains the so-called 'jumper cable' episode", adding, [...] "My illness has taught me something about the nature of humanity, love, brotherhood, and relationships that I never understood, and probably never would have.

We were new and inexperienced and events kept occurring one after the other which we had to deal with. In doing that, we made mistakes as I told you. I admit it now and I admitted it in the notes I have written. Whoever wishes to blame or attack me is entitled to do so. I regret I didn't have enough experience to totally control the movement. On the other hand, with our constant struggle, this had to be done together with others in the communist world to stop Kampuchea becoming Vietnamese. For the love of the nation and the people it was the right thing to do but in the course of our actions we made mistakes." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2006, {{a number}} of {{universities}} in Canada jointly refused {{to participate in the}} Maclean’s University Rankings survey. The president of the University of Alberta, Indira Samarasekera, commented that, [...] "Canadian universities are listening with great interest as the call to boycott U.S. News & World Report rankings continues to increase in volume among our colleagues to the south. Many of our American colleagues say {{that they would like to}} resist the rankings, but fear it can’t be done, especially if only a few institutions act. I write to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> institutions can take on the rankings.
