[...] Ian MacFarlane, Cho's former classmate, stated that, [...] "when we read Cho's plays, it was <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nightmare. The plays had really twisted, macabre violence that used weapons I wouldn't have even thought of." [...] When Stephen Davis, a senior {{who was also}} in Cho's class, read Richard McBeef, {{he turned to his}} roommate and said, [...] "This is {{the kind of guy who}} is going to walk into a classroom and start shooting people." [...] Anna Brown, another student in the class, sometimes joked with her friends that Cho was [...] "the kind of guy who might go on a rampage killing." ...|$|E
500|$|Poole {{refers to}} Eli Gold as a [...] "wartime consigliere", a {{reference}} to the Tom Hagen lawyer character in the 1972 Mafia film The Godfather, which is itself based on a Mario Puzo novel of the same name. In turn, Gold disparagingly refers to Poole as a [...] "Shiksa Bambi", {{a reference to}} the title character of the 1942 Disney animated film Bambi, about a naive deer unaccustomed to the realities and horrors of the real world. Kurt McVeigh's country mannerisms and dress prompt Diane to refer to him as the Marlboro Man, a cowboy-like figure used in tobacco advertisements for Marlboro cigarettes. Upon learning about his morals, Diane said he was <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> novel by Herman Melville, the 19th century novelist who wrote Moby-Dick and Billy Budd. She also jokingly asks whether Kurt is related to Timothy McVeigh, the man convicted of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, by saying: [...] "Oh my goodness what an unfortunate name. Hopefully no relation." [...] Diane, a liberal, is taken aback by the conservative Kurt's enthusiasm for Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee. As a joke, Kurt sends her a copy of Palin's 2009 memoir, [...] She in turn sends him the parody book Going Rouge: A Candid Look Inside The Mind Of Political Conservative Sarah Palin, which is filled with empty pages.|$|E

500|$|Spin {{reviewed}} the track favourably, {{calling it a}} [...] "celebrity-at-the-crossroads soul ballad" [...] with an [...] "ambient gospel sweep that's both haunted and joyful". Mojo praised the song's musicianship, saying it was [...] "graced by swaggering performances" [...] and that the Edge's [...] "languid guitar solo" [...] was reminiscent of David Gilmour. Q echoed these sentiments, commending Bono's soulful singing and the Edge's solo. The reviewer christened the song as [...] "this album's 'One' or 'With or Without You', with added bonus points". The Washington Post called the song one of the record's highlights and enjoyed the track's gospel qualities. The reviewer wrote, [...] "The vocal harmonies on the choruses sound <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> church in some distant, dystopian world; the woozy, slightly detuned piano adds to that impression..." [...] Hot Press gave the song a favourable review, calling it a [...] "sweeping" [...] track and suggesting it [...] "conjure the same spiritual vibe as Marvin Gaye's 'Abraham, Martin & John'". Time gave No Line on the Horizon a negative review, but praised [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] for its [...] "heartbreaking melody" [...] and Bono's [...] "Oh-oh-oh" [...] vocals that reminded the critic {{of the end of}} [...] "With or Without You". Bono and Daniel Lanois both cited the song as their favourite track on the album, and Brian Eno thought the band should have chosen it as the album's first single. [...] Musician Gavin Friday described the song as [...] "Al Green on Irish steroids", and Hot Press editor Niall Stokes called it [...] "a modern rock classic" [...] that will [...] "stand forever as one of U2's most inspirational creations".|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} a mixed response from television critics. IGN contributor Robert Canning said [...] "Flu Shot" [...] {{had a number of}} aspects that he enjoyed, but [...] "as a whole" [...] the episode was not completely satisfying, and reasoned that this episode fell below 30 Rock standards. He said that he personally did not buy the idea of Liz taking a tropical vacation, [...] "hat's just not the Liz I know. But even ignoring this, the bits involved, especially the flashes to Liz on the beach, weren't all that inspired." [...] Canning also was critical of Jack and Elisa's story as he felt it was weak. Overall, he rated the episode a 7.6 out of 10. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote, [...] "Is it just me or was this one of the more lacking episodes of 30 Rock? It's not that it was terrible... but this one just seemed to meander. It wasn't as funny as other episodes... and that whole crew-as-zombies-with-the-flu stuff was a little bit too surreal, even for this show." [...] Further in his review, Sassone wrote that the Tracy and Jenna subplot started funny, but ended [...] "in a lame, predictable manner." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger, also disliked [...] "Flu Shot", opining that it was a disappointment. Sepinwall further added that the Jack and Elisa story [...] "felt <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bad '80s sitcom – and not even the 30 Rock take on a bad '80s sitcom episode." [...] Sepinwall, however, wrote that the episode did have a good moment with Kenneth suggesting to Tracy that he and Jenna get soup for the sick crew themselves, and with Tracy replying [...] "With what? My arms?".|$|E
