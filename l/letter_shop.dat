25|$|On November 13, 1905, Richards and Comstock were {{sentence}}d to the custody of a United States Marshal for six hours and a fine of $300 and half of court costs. The modest sentence may have reflected a finding {{that they did not}} intimidate settlers and that their employees were at work removing the fences. Controversially, newspaper accounts charged that Richards and Comstock took part in a victory celebration instead of serving time. The Secretary of the Interior was upset about the news and fired District Attorney Baxter and Marshal Thomas L. Mathews, the officer in charge of Richards and Comstock's six-hour sentence.

40|$|Digitally unwrapping {{images of}} paper sheets {{is crucial for}} {{accurate}} document scanning and text recognition. This paper presents a method for automatically rectifying curved or folded paper sheets from a few images captured from multiple viewpoints. Prior methods either need expensive 3 D scanners or model deformable surfaces using over-simplified parametric representations. In contrast, our method uses regular images {{and is based on}} general developable surface models that can represent a wide variety of paper deformations. Our main contribution is a new robust rectification method based on ridge-aware 3 D reconstruction of a paper sheet and unwrapping the reconstructed surface using properties of developable surfaces via ℓ_ 1 conformal mapping.

40|$|In recent years, a {{multitude}} of most interesting research {{has been carried out}} in linguistics, psycholinguistics, computational linguistics and information retrieval with regard to the topic of web genres. Despite the increasing interest in this novel and innovative field within different communities, there is still a significant lack in literature, especially concerning edited collections and journal issues that provide an overview of recent research. The aim of this special issue of the Journal for Language Technology and Computational Linguistics is to contribute to filling this gap. More specifically, this issue is dedicated to automatic genre identification. 1 Genres are categories that subsume texts which have multiple features in common, most importantly, a shared communicative purpose. Genres form and evolve within specific discourse communities, are instantiated as well as enforced and most often also given a name by members of their respective discourse communities. An important characteristic is that their users are able to recognise certain genres, such as, for example, an invoice, a business <b>letter,</b> a <b>shopping</b> list, or a menu very quickly based on genre-specific properties (such as, for example, a conventionalized text structure...|$|R
6000|$|Looking at that {{polished}} row of boots, Cecilia felt {{lonely and}} unsatisfied. Stephen {{worked in the}} Law Courts, Thyme worked at Art; both were doing something definite. She alone, it seemed, had to wait at home, and order dinner, answer <b>letters,</b> <b>shop,</b> pay calls, and do a dozen things that failed to stop her thoughts from dwelling on that woman's tale. She was not often conscious {{of the nature of}} her life, so like the lives of many hundred women in this London, which she said she could not stand, but which she stood very well. As a rule, with practical good sense, she kept her doubting eyes fixed friendlily on every little phase in turn, enjoying well enough fitting the Chinese puzzle of her scattered thoughts, setting out on each small adventure with a certain cautious zest, and taking Stephen with her as far as he allowed. This last year or so, now that Thyme was a grown girl, she had felt at once a loss of purpose and a gain of liberty. She hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry. It freed her for the tasting of more things, more people, and more Stephen; but it left a little void in her heart, a little soreness round it. What would Thyme think if she heard this story about her uncle? The thought started a whole train of doubts that had of late beset her. Was her little daughter going to turn out like herself? If not, why not? Stephen joked about his daughter's skirts, her hockey, her friendship with young men. He joked about the way Thyme refused to let him joke about her art or about her interest in [...] "the people." [...] His joking was a source of irritation to Cecilia. For, by woman's instinct rather than by any reasoning process, she was conscious of a disconcerting change. Amongst the people she knew, young men were not now attracted by girls as they had been in her young days. There was a kind of cool and friendly matter-of-factness in the way they treated them, a sort of almost scientific playfulness. And Cecilia felt uneasy as to how far this was to go. She seemed left behind. If young people were really becoming serious, if youths no longer cared about the colour of Thyme's eyes, or dress, or hair, what would there be left to care for--that is, up to the point of definite relationship? Not that she wanted her daughter to be married. It would be time enough to think of that when she was twenty-five. But her own experiences had been so different. She had spent so many youthful hours in wondering about men, had seen so many men cast furtive looks at her; and now there did not seem in men or girls anything left worth the other's while to wonder or look furtive about. She was not of a philosophic turn of mind, and had attached no deep meaning to Stephen's jest--"If young people will reveal their ankles, they'll soon have no ankles to reveal." ...|$|R

Directed by Pound, Kasper started a small press (Square Dollar Press) in 1951 to publish works the poet favored; in 1953 he opened the Make it New bookshop in Greenwich Village, displaying Pound's <b>letters</b> in the <b>shop</b> window. Kasper campaigned against racial integration in the South, calling it a Jewish plot. In these activities and others, Kasper believed he was disseminating the poet's ideas.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the role of {{instruction}} method in early writing applied by the teacher on childrens early writing development and knowledge of genre The respondents were sixty students of the first and second grades of six different elementary schools in Makassar. They were asked to compose three different types of genre: a story, a personal <b>letter,</b> and a <b>shopping</b> list each of which was analyzed qualitatively. The finding showed that the applied teaching method had a big role on the students early writing development and knowledge of genre. The emphasis of the traditional method on the neatness and correctness of the students writing caused most of the students writing to have reached the final stage of early writing development, which was correct formation and spelling of letters and words. However, the traditional method used by the teachers limited the students freedom from exploring their writing freely since they focused only on the transcription skills...|$|R

6000|$|The {{wrath of}} Mr. Neefit on {{receiving}} this <b>letter</b> at his <b>shop</b> in Conduit Street was almost divine. He {{had heard from}} Polly an account of that last interview at Ramsgate, and Polly had told her story as truly as {{she knew how to}} tell it. But the father had never for a moment allowed himself to conceive that therefore the thing was at an end, and had instructed Polly that she was not to look upon it in that light. He regarded his young customer as absolutely bound to him, and would not acknowledge to himself that such obligation could be annulled by Polly's girlish folly. And he did believe that young Newton intended to act, as he called it, [...] "on the square." [...] So believing, he was ready to make almost any sacrifice of himself; but that Newton should now go back, after having received his hard money, was to him a thing quite out of the question. He scolded Polly with some violence, and asked whether she wanted to marry such a lout as Moggs. Polly replied with spirit that she wouldn't marry any man till she found that she could love him, and that the man loved her. [...] "Ain't he told you as he loves you ever so often?" [...] said Neefit. [...] "I know what I'm doing of, father," [...] said Polly, [...] "and I'm not going to be drove." [...] Nevertheless Mr. Neefit had felt certain that if young Newton would still act upon the square, things would settle themselves rightly. There was the money due, and, as Neefit constantly said to himself, [...] "money was a thing as was not to be got over." ...|$|R
40|$|The Internet {{is slowly}} {{becoming}} {{a mirror of}} the society. Everything {{we do in the}} real world, we want to do out on the Net: conduct private conversations, keep personal papers, sign <b>letters</b> and contracts, <b>shop,</b> publish documents etc. All these things require security, but we go ahead using the net without asking too many questions. Today security issues are not a fundamental starting point. This also means that the limits of security are the limits of the Internet. There are several reasons behind that municipalities should enter the digital world. Firstly, they have to follow the trends citizens will expect them to offer these kinds of services when they meet them elsewhere in their daily life. Secondly, it is clearly more efficient if one could move from double bookkeeping (paper and electronic) to just using bits and bytes, which also will mean that public employees could have time to handle other issues. Thirdly, an electronic system is available 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, which means that you can interact with the Municipality whenever you have the time (also called 7 / 24 -administration). Municipalities in Norway have recently started to use Internet connection as a mean of communication with their residents. There is a need of analysing vulnerable points in this connection in order to better protect the information stored in the municipality, especially if this information should be shared with the inhabitants. In this thesis we have studied threats to the electronic communication and their impact. We have set up requirements for secure communication, which became the basis for our end solution. The main requirement to electronic communication is the use of digital signatures. A digital signature is the main element that makes the electronic communication over Internet secure both for private persons and institutions. It confirms the identity of the other party; ensures that the contents of any document have not been changed in any way; verifies that the document has come from the claimed party and ensures that the original signing party cannot later claim not to have signed. Thus a digital signature provides such security services as authentication, integrity, authenticity and non- repudiation. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the necessary infrastructure for digital signatures. PKI is an infrastructure for a distributed environment that centres on management and distribution of public keys and digital certificates. The main goal of PKI is to make authentication possible. PKI supports electronic signatures and secure communications by providing electronic certificates. A Public Key Certificate (PKC) is a digital document attesting to the identity of the certificate holder and can be used to sign documents electronically...|$|R
40|$|Today {{more and}} more {{creative}} people are convinced {{of the fact that}} working across the borders of disciplines, between experts and audiences/users/patients/ [...] . could lead to inventive new ideas and outcomes. This research analyses how participation across these borders is made possible during a creative process. It starts with describing how the concept of participatory creation is related to evolutions in new media and culture (Chapter 1 : Participatory culture) and in the field of design and the field of (media) art (Chapter 2 : An art and design of participation). These evolutions are often linked to the term participatory culture. This refers to a culture in which individuals can collaborate, making use of media/tools {{that can be used in}} a networked way. Despite these possibilities, participation is still not part of the everyday creative practice of individuals and organisations. What is often perceived as difficult by creators, is that, while participating, they should open their creation process / output up for (un) expected adaptations, without  however  losing their expert creative input. This practice is seldom understood and transferred in higher (art) education or in organisations in the creative field. Participatory culture has been the subject of a lot of research in the field of Cultural Studies. This research is often focussed on the role of the end-user and on participation in the phase after the creation process. By complementing insight from the field of Cultural Studies with research in the fields of Participatory Design, Participatory Art and Media Art, this Phd research focusses on the perspective of the maker and the creation process of things that trigger participation. The challenge was therefore to provide creative practitioners with an insight in this participatory creation process by making its components very concrete in the form of a roadmap. I focussed on the role of tangible things that can mediate participatory processes. Apparently, things with certain qualities are particularly good mediators of participatory processes. These things appear to enable creative people to release part of their control, while keeping their valuable expert view present in the creative process (Chapter 3. Hybrid and Risky Things). I can roughly make a division between two types of things. One type mediates formal participatory processes and the other is a good driver of informal participatory processes. I call the first model hybrid things, a term that is used to refer to things which have proven their success in mediating professional or more formal participatory creation processes, like prototypes, context mappings, storyboards, [...] . The creator designs them as an imaginative template-like form that can be remixed by every participant in a very personal way. I call the second type risky things. They are the drivers behind informal participatory processes in informal contexts, like online social networks. These are very similar to hybrid things, but the difference is that thecreator has totake the risk to release a significant degree of her/his control over them. They are created to speak for themselves outside the area of influence of the creator and to trigger an endless chain of (un) expected uses and remixes. The RepRap printer is an example of a risky thing. It is an open source 3 D printer that is created to be adapted by unexpected participants. Therefore it is accompanied by manuals that allow people, like a group of teachers in a design educational institute, to know how it works and rework it for their own context. Via the method of mapping I visualised 6 real-life participatory processes and the way in which they were mediated by imaginative hybrid and risky things (Chapter 4 MAP-it) (Chapter 5 Case Studies). The first is a Belgian case, called DarkMatr, that was funded by a new funding program (IBBT, Art&D). This program stimulates participation across the borders of disciplines of art, science and technology. DarkMatr is an artistic mixed reality installation, that evolves through audience participation. The second describes the creation process of the participatory game Uncle Roy All Around You, by the media art/performance collective Blast Theory. The third is a project by the Belgian media art collective Constant vzw, who created a participatory internet walk through a few cities, called Routes and Routines. The fourth case is by the Dutch media art lab The Patching Zone who create participatory projects to generate change in concrete local communities, being the event Cultuur Lokaal and the city game Gofor IT!. The fifth case is a participatory architecture game (Ontwerpbox) and a 3 D clay printer with which people can print their own ceramics (lArtisan Electronique) by the Belgian design collective Unfold. The last case is the creation process of Smarttouch/Touchatag by the international telecommunications company Alcatel-Lucent, that wanted to create an application with which people can create their own smart environment. This research thus aims to give an insight in participatory creation processes and concrete and successful approaches in the field to creative practitioners, researchers, lecturers or students. Plus, it stresses the fact that when creators take the risk to release part of their control over their creation process and product/work, this could lead to many unexpected, inventive and even innovative outcomes. p { margin-bottom: 0. 21 cm; }PART I.
