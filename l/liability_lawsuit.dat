25|$|In 1993, Edwards {{began his}} own firm in Raleigh (now named Kirby & Holt) with a friend, David Kirby. He {{became known as}} the top plaintiffs' {{attorney}} in North Carolina. The biggest case of his legal career was a 1996 product <b>liability</b> <b>lawsuit</b> against Sta-Rite, the manufacturer of a defective pool drain cover. The case involved Valerie Lakey, a three-year-old girl who was disemboweled by the suction power of the pool drain pump when she sat on an open pool drain whose protective cover had been removed by other children at the pool, after the swim club had failed to install the cover properly. Despite 12 prior suits with similar claims, Sta-Rite continued to make and sell drain covers lacking warnings. Sta-Rite protested that an additional warning would have made no difference because the pool owners already knew the importance of keeping the cover secured.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{known as}} the [...] "McDonald's coffee case", Liebeck v. McDonald's is a {{well-known}} product <b>liability</b> <b>lawsuit</b> that became a flash point in {{the debate in the}} U.S. over tort reform after a jury awarded $2.9 million to Stella Liebeck, a 79-year-old woman from Albuquerque, New Mexico, who sued McDonald's after she suffered third-degree burns from hot coffee that was spilled on her at one of the company's drive-thrus in 1992. The trial judge reduced the total award to $640,000, and the parties settled for a confidential amount before an appeal was decided. The case entered popular understanding as an example of frivolous litigation; ABC News calls the case [...] "the poster child of excessive lawsuits." [...] Trial-lawyer groups such as the Association of Trial Lawyers of America and other opponents of tort reform sometimes argue that the suit was justified because of the extent of Liebeck's injuries. In addition, McDonald's failed to provide proper warning. Warning consumers of possible dangers of their products is strictly enforced by the FDA. Furthermore, McDonald's should not be serving substances that are potentially harmful to their consumers.|$|E

50|$|In 1994 NASA {{launched}} the Advanced General Aviation Transport Experiments (AGATE) project {{in an attempt}} to re-energize the rapidly shrinking general aviation (GA) market. A series of factors, including new regulatory requirements and immense legal <b>liability</b> <b>lawsuit</b> settlements made the GA field unprofitable and most manufacturers had abandoned production of piston-engined light aircraft to concentrate on the business turbine aircraft market. As a result, GA design work had basically ended and aircraft for sale in 1990 were essentially the same as those from the 1970s. With a thriving market for used aircraft, American GA aircraft production numbers declined from 18,000 in 1978 to 954 in 1993, an all-time low.|$|E

50|$|Strictly speaking, {{tombstone}} mentality {{decisions are}} examples {{where there is}} no incentive for an economic actor to be a 'first mover' and promote safety.

5000|$|In the U.S., anyone, {{including}} the city issuing building permits, may face a civil <b>liability</b> <b>lawsuit</b> for negligently creating {{a situation that}} results in loss of life or property. Those who fail to adhere to well known best practices for safety have been held negligent. This liability {{and the desire to}} protect residents has motivated cities to adopt and enforce building codes that specify standards and practices for electrical systems (as well as other departments such as water and fuel-gas systems). This creates a system whereby a city can best avoid lawsuits by adopting a single, standard set of building code laws. This has led to the NEC becoming the de facto standard set of electrical requirements. [...] A licensed electrician will have spent years of apprenticeship studying and practicing the NEC requirements prior to obtaining his or her license.|$|E

50|$|A further gendered {{aspect of}} {{effective}} service delivery centres around {{the skills of}} security sector personnel themselves. Other societal factors tend to result in men and women having different skill sets. Consequently, if security sector institutions lack either male and female staff at any level, their staff will possess a smaller skill set, limiting their operational options. For example, studies in the USA found that American female police officers were more adept at policing {{without the use of}} excessive or deadly force than their male counterparts, although they were as likely to use force as men when absolutely necessary. As a result, male police officers cost US taxpayers between 2.5 and 5.5 times more in legal fees related to excessive force <b>liability</b> <b>lawsuit</b> payouts and are almost {{three times more likely to}} be threatened or attacked by citizens. Despite the proven ability of women to increase the skill set of police forces, the closest any police force has come to achieving gender balance is Estonia, where 33.5% of officers are female.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} types of policy {{instruments}} {{that can be used}} to try to remedy risks to health posed by the farming and processing of foods for consumption. The government can develop process rules that explicitly state which procedures are appropriate for handling particular foods.

Food labeling rules, government-funded food safety research, and consumer education are additional tools. The potential for product <b>liability</b> <b>lawsuits</b> against manufacturers with poor safety practices offers another incentive for producers to take appropriate care when handling and processing foods.|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} and critiques apology laws, {{their potential}} use, and effectiveness, both legally and ethically, {{in light of}} the strong professional norms that shape physicians’ reaction to medical errors. Physicians are largely reluctant to disclose medical errors to patients, patients’ families, and even other physicians. Some states have passed so-called apology laws in order to encourage physicians to disclose medical errors to patients. Apology laws allow defendants to exclude statements of sympathy made after accidents from evidence in a <b>liability</b> <b>lawsuit.</b> This piece examines potential barriers to physicians’ disclosure of medical mistakes and demonstrates how the underlying problem may actually be rooted in professional norms—norms that will remain outside the scope of law’s influence.

40|$|In a {{comprehensive}} study extending prior research, Prince and Rubin (2002) use the event study methodology, and find negative market {{reaction to a}} sample of 15 initial filings of product liability litigation and 29 other litigation events against U. S. automakers between 1973 and 1995. They conclude that the event study methodology is a useful way to measure the costs of litigation. In contrast, after examination of a new sample of 144 initial filing events and 465 other litigation events for six major automobile firms from 1985 to 2000, and after re-examining Prince and Rubins data, we find that the market reaction to all but the most extreme and infrequent events is generally not significant. We suggest that the event study methodology may not generally be useful to study the social costs of litigation, but may be useful for unexpected abnormal litigation events where the potential liabilities (including reputation and other losses triggered by litigation) may far exceed the legal liability reserves set up by firms. We find mixed results for the market impact of litigation against a competitor. When a product <b>liability</b> <b>lawsuit</b> is first filed against a U. S. firm, the market values of the Japanese firms significantly decline. When a Japanese firm is sued for product liability, the U. S. firms register a significant increase in market value. However, these spillover results have to be interpreted with caution because of small sample sizes and possible confounding events. ...|$|E

MethodsA descriptive, uni and bivariate analysis of the forensic expert reports available was conducted. ResultsInformation was gathered for 402 cases. 77 % occurred in Bogota, 69. 2 % were associated with women, the mean age was 36. 4 years, and the private healthcare providers accounted for 52 % of the total. 80 % of the lawsuits were filed against the State and directly against the practitioners, and 59 % were criminal cases. The percentage of medical specialties involved most frequently was distributed as follows: 41 % in obstetrics and gynecology, 45 % in other surgical areas, 6 % in clinical areas and 5 % in pediatrics. The most frequent diagnoses were: fetal death of unexplained cause, accidental puncture or laceration during a procedure. 45 % of forensic reports were prepared by clinical or surgical specialists.
