40|$|We study {{propagation}} of TM- and TE-polarized light in two-dimensional arrays of silver nanorods of various diameters in a gelatin background. We calculate the transmittance, reflectance and absorption of arranged and disordered nanorod arrays {{and compare the}} exact numerical results with the predictions of the Maxwell-Garnett effective-medium theory. We show that interactions between nanorods, multipole contributions and formations of photonic gaps affect strongly the transmittance spectra that cannot be accounted for {{in terms of the}} conventional effective-medium theory. We also demonstrate and explain the degradation of the transmittance in arrays with randomly <b>located</b> <b>rods</b> as well as weak influence of their fluctuating diameter. For TM modes we outline the importance of skin-effect, which causes the full reflection of the incoming light. We then illustrate the possibility of using periodic arrays of nanorods as high-quality polarizers. Comment: 6 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{incidence}} of spinal deformity {{in children with}} Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is high, with 86 % of these patients {{found to have a}} significant structural scoliosis; however, there are very few case reports describing surgical treatment for this deformity. Methods The authors reviewed a case series consisting of 6 patients who underwent spine surgery for scoliosis. Children's mean age at index surgery was 12 years and 10 months (range, 10 to 15 yrs). Clinical evaluation revealed the typical phenotypic features of the PWS in all of the patients; 4 subjects had a karyotype confirmation of PWS. Major structural curves showed preoperative mean Cobb angles of 80. 8 ° (range, 65 ° to 96 °). Hybrid instrumentation with sublaminar wires, hooks and screws was used in the first 2 patients, while the remaining 4 were treated with titanium pedicle screw constructs. Results The mean clinical and radiological follow-up was 3 years and 10 months (range, 2 years to 9 years). Major complication rate was 50 %. One patient who developed a major intraoperative complication (paraparesis) prevented spinal fusion to be obtained: the neurologic deficit resolved completely after instrumentation removal. Solid arthrodesis and deformity correction in both coronal and sagittal plane was, however, achieved in the other 5 cases and no significant curve progression was observed at follow-up. Another major short-term complication was encountered 3 months after surgery in a patient who experienced the detachment of a distally <b>located</b> <b>rod</b> and required correction through revision surgery and caudal extension by one level. Cervico-thoracic kyphosis was seen in 1 patient who did not require revision surgery. Conclusions Spine reconstructive surgery in patients with PWS is rare and highly demanding. The best method of reconstruction is posterior multilevel pedicle screw fixation. Moreover, even with modern techniques, the risk of complications is still high. These new techniques, however, have shown to improve the postoperative course by allowing for immediate mobilization without any brace or cast. The use of the growing rod techniques, requiring repeated surgeries, should be carefully evaluated in each single case. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{work has}} two primary parts: (1) an {{exhaustive}} literature review highlighting {{the need and}} the direction to study broadband noise generation from the fan stage of a modern high bypass ratio turbofan engine, and (2) a benchmark study of noise generation by the flow over a rod and an airfoil in tandem arrangement. The literature review highlights that not all the experimental data has been consistently explained with the theory and thus these gaps are required to be filled in to improve the fan noise prediction during the design phases. The benchmark case provides flow conditions where the upstream <b>located</b> circular <b>rod</b> sheds periodic vortices and creates turbulence which interacts with downstream located symmetric airfoil at zero angle of attack. This interaction produces noise which radiates to farfield. The periodic shedding and the resulting turbulence provides energy to the tonal and broadband components of the total noise.

40|$|In mammals {{the retina}} {{contains}} photoactive molecules responsible for both vision and circadian photoresponse systems. Opsins, which are <b>located</b> in <b>rods</b> and cones, are the pigments for vision {{but it is}} not known whether they play a role in circadian regulation. A subset of retinal ganglion cells with direct projections to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) are at the origin of the retinohypothalamic tract that transmits the light signal to the master circadian clock in the SCN. However, the ganglion cells are not known to contain rhodopsin or other opsins that may function as photoreceptors. We have found that the two blue-light photoreceptors, cryptochromes 1 and 2 (CRY 1 and CRY 2), recently discovered in mammals are specifically expressed in the ganglion cell and inner nuclear layers of the mouse retina. In addition, CRY 1 is expressed at high level in the SCN and oscillates in this tissue in a circadian manner. These data, in conjunction with the established role of CRY 2 in photoperiodism in plants, lead us to propose that mammals have a vitamin A-based photopigment (opsin) for vision and a vitamin B 2 -based pigment (cryptochrome) for entrainment of the circadian clock...|$|R
