40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} view of {{transformation}} of character of <b>live</b> <b>reports</b> in television news and shows current nature of <b>live</b> <b>reports</b> {{in the sphere of}} Czech media. Live broadcasting is the heart of television and radio as electronic media. Despite the fact that live broadcasting started together with the beginning of television broadcasting, only television news managed to keep the nature of live broadcasting for the whole time of its existence. <b>Live</b> <b>reporting</b> is specific part of live broadcasting and belongs to phenomenons that have been changing in the course of time. These changes are caused by constant technological development and improvement of technical equipment. The breakthrough came with the transformation from analogue to digital broadcasting. Digitalization meant significant simplification of realization of <b>live</b> <b>reports</b> and natural result there was considerable growth of their numbers. However, together with growing quantity changed also their quality. Original intention - to ensure witness directly from the place of event {{at the time of its}} performance, transformed to the effort to drag viewers into the event at the cost of everything. As a result there are <b>live</b> <b>reports</b> from the places that are not connected with the event at all. Besides legitimate <b>live</b> <b>reports</b> there are "live for the [...] ...|$|R

Technologicaladvancements, the equipping of TV stations with mobile satellite vans, and the pressure of competition have all resulted in increased instances of <b>live</b> <b>reporting.</b> When investigating news values, pictureand sound, as well as the possibility of immediate, timely reporting represent the key characteristics of TV journalism. In this context, <b>live</b> <b>reports,</b> as part of a news segment, should add to the authenticity and credibility of the program. Currently, however, TV broadcasting houses attempt to best one another in the number of live broadcasts as a means to purport a higher quality of their program. The direct address to the camera turns a reporter from an anonymous bearer of information into the “main star”. The figures accumulated on the extent of this form used in a news show do not determine the professional level of the editorial policy. <b>Live</b> <b>reporting</b> cannot be regarded as news value if other news values are neglected in the process.
