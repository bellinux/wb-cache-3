40|$|Suffolk breed is the English hornless breed which {{belongs to}} the breed of meat yield. Typical {{features}} are excellent maternal qualities, good milkiness of ewes and fertility, less fertile period (lambing mostly in winter and spring) and good adaptability to different climatic conditions and breeding conditions. The breed {{is characterized by a}} black outer coat {{on the face of the}} head and lower part of <b>legs,</b> <b>wool</b> is short, white, semi-fine. Suffolk breed is characterized by high fertility throughout the production period ewes. Season, age, interval among lambing, body weight and body conditions score, nutrition, genetics, breeding and heat stress belong to the factors affecting fertility. When we compare fertility sheep breed Suffolk in the Czech Republic and Slovakia we achieved a higher number of ewes, improved fertility and fertilization. On the contrary, Slovakia has achieved better results in fertility at lambing ewe. It was also achieved in Canada in comparison with our republic. It is a major prerequisite of the production of heavy great muscled slaughter lambs with very good quality meat at meat production. Meat production is influenced by hormones, nutrition, gender, influence year and month of lambing, ewes age, litter size on the dependent variable. The values are not very different when meat production in Suffolk breed is evaluated in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In spite of it, the Czech Republic achieves better results in weight of lambs at 100 days and the average daily gain. If we evaluate the difference between meat production in Canada and the Czech Republic in selected parameters such as birth weight of lambs, weight of lambs at 100 days of age and avarage daily gain, Canada clearly has much better results. The main cause is a different type of breed. Increase fertility and meat production can be achieved mainly by improving reproduction and production indicators...|$|R
50|$|Twenty-seven {{officers}} from the Department of Motor Vehicles Highway Patrol were incorporated into the new department. Troopers were outfitted with khaki shirts with contrasting shoulder passant, cuffs, and pocket lapels on Fern green and trimmed in Old Gold galloon. A Fern green necktie is worn. A cloisonné coat of arms of Vermont in gold and enamel is worn on the shirt collars. Most members of the force wore Fern green breeches with a single or double Old Gold colored <b>leg</b> stripe, <b>wool</b> tunics of the same colors, a black Sam Browne belt and jackboot. The uniform remains with little modification. The Second World War association of breeches and jackboots with Nazism caused many U.S. state and municipal forces to curtail use of breeches and jackboots except for mounted horse and motor patrols. In Vermont both troopers and game wardens of the state's Department of Fish and Game switched from the breeches and high polished black boots to tailored trousers, retaining the Old Gold leg stripes.|$|R

30|$|There are two salient {{points to}} note about {{the route to}} Bitlis: First of all, in this place, the typical transhumant sheep is a breed called Cizirî by farmers (pronounced as 'djiziri') and {{sometimes}} Himdanî. Its physical specificity differentiates it more clearly from the other breeds: having a brown head and <b>legs,</b> yellowish <b>wool,</b> being long and slender, having a large tail (like all Kurdish sheep), and very long ears. This race belonged {{to one of the}} Alikan families 40 years ago, when Besikçi (1969) photographed the camps on Mount Nemrut overlooking Lake Van. This breed morphologically resembles the Awassi sheep breed, or Ivesi in Turkish, of which there are 4 million in Turkey. Studies are underway to differentiate local races within this minority population (Flamant 2006) in the country, which is more than 2 % of the national herd (Askin et al. 1989). The name Ciziri may be closer to the Awassi variety from Iraq, the sheep breed called Gezirieh (Epstein 1985), and a breed called Djezireh in the Syrian region in the northeast of the country, along the borders with Turkey and Iraq, bordering Lake Van, and also the homonymous Turkish city of Cizre.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Bibliotheca, when Hephaestus unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to rape Athena, she wiped his semen off her <b>leg</b> with <b>wool</b> {{and threw it}} on the ground, impregnating Gaia. Athena wished to make the resulting infant Erichthonius immortal and to raise it, so she gave it to three sisters, Herse, Aglauros and Pandrosos, in a willow basket and warned them to never open it. Aglauros and Herse disobeyed her and opened the basket which contained the infant and future king, Erichthonius, who was somehow mixed or intertwined with a snake. The sight caused Herse and Aglauros to go insane and they jumped to their deaths off the Acropolis. Shrines were constructed for Herse and Aglauros on the Acropolis.An alternative {{version of the story}} [...] is that, while Athena was gone bringing a limestone mountain from the Pallene peninsula to use in the Acropolis, the sisters, minus Pandrosos again, opened the box with Erichthonius inside. A crow witnessed the opening and flew away to tell Athena, who fell into a rage and dropped the mountain (now Mt. Lykabettos). Once again, Herse and Aglauros went insane and threw themselves to their deaths off the cliffs of the Acropolis. This story supposedly inspired an ancient ritual in Athens: [...] "The Festival of the Dew Carriers" [...] or Arrhephoria.|$|R
6000|$|... "Having {{completed}} my preparations, I imparted to the avuncular pendulum {{a gentle}} oscillation, and retiring to cover behind a contiguous rock, lifted up my voice {{in a long}} rasping cry whose diminishing final note was drowned in a noise {{like that of a}} swearing cat, which emanated from the sack. Instantly that formidable sheep was upon its feet and had taken in the military situation at a glance. In a few moments it had approached, stamping, to within fifty yards of the swinging foeman, who, now retreating and anon advancing, seemed to invite the fray. Suddenly I saw the beast's head drop earthward as if depressed by the weight of its enormous horns; then a dim, white, wavy streak of sheep prolonged itself from that spot in a generally horizontal direction to within about four yards of a point immediately beneath the enemy. There it struck sharply upward, and before it had faded from my gaze at the place whence it had set out I heard a horrid thump and a piercing scream, and my poor uncle shot forward, with a slack rope higher than the limb to which he was attached. Here the rope tautened with a jerk, arresting his flight, and back he swung in a breathless curve {{to the other end of}} his arc. The ram had fallen, a heap of indistinguishable <b>legs,</b> <b>wool</b> and horns, but pulling itself together and dodging as its antagonist swept downward it retired at random, alternately shaking its head and stamping its fore-feet. When it had backed about the same distance as that from which it had delivered the assault it paused again, bowed its head as if in prayer for victory and again shot forward, dimly visible as before--a prolonging white streak with monstrous undulations, ending with a sharp ascension. Its course this time was at a right angle to its former one, and its impatience so great that it struck the enemy before he had nearly reached the lowest point of his arc. In consequence he went flying round and round in a horizontal circle whose radius was about equal to half the length of the rope, which I forgot to say was nearly twenty feet long. His shrieks, crescendo in approach and diminuendo in recession, made the rapidity of his revolution more obvious to the ear than to the eye. He had evidently not yet been struck in a vital spot. His posture in the sack and the distance from the ground at which he hung compelled the ram to operate upon his lower extremities and the end of his back. Like a plant that has struck its root into some poisonous mineral, my poor uncle was dying slowly upward.|$|R

40|$|The {{reproductive}} performance, growth, slaughter traits, {{and several}} conformation characteristics in Dorper sheep (hair and wool types) were evaluated under extensive {{conditions in the}} north-western Karoo region of South Africa. From 1993 to 2000, lambs of hair (n= 1070) and wool (n= 1044) type Dorper sheep, and corresponding reproductive records from 872 and 874, respectively, were analysed. There was {{no significant differences between}} hair and wool type lambs for body weight from 42 days till 12 months of age, and for pre- or post-weaning growth rate. The analysis of conformation tend to suggest that the hair type lambs were blockier with shorter legs, compared to the leggier appearance of the wool type lambs. This is also evident from the longer carcass length (108. 5 vs. 107. 2 cm) and hind <b>leg</b> length of <b>wool</b> type lambs compared to hair type lambs. With regard to other carcass traits, wool type lambs had heavier carcasses (19. 6 vs. 19. 2 kg) and higher dressing percentage (49. 9 vs. 49. 0 %), though, fat measurements and carcass grades were similar. The ewes of the hair type were heavier at mating than wool type (57. 4 vs. 56. 4 kg). No differences were, however, observed for percentage of ewes lambed, lambs born, lambs weaned, survival rate of lambs or kg lamb produced per ewe per year. It was concluded that the economically important reproduction and growth traits were similar between the hair and wool types of Dorper sheep. Differences that do occur in some conformation and carcass traits will not effect the economic realisation from the different types...|$|R
