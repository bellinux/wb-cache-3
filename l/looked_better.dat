5|$|Dual Destinies was {{the first}} game in the main series to be {{developed}} for the Nintendo 3DS; this move from the Nintendo DS to the Nintendo 3DS {{was the most difficult}} part of the development, with the development team being unsure of whether to use 2D graphics like with previous games or to use 3D models. Eventually they decided to use 3D graphics, because of the stereoscopic 3D effect being a selling point for the Nintendo 3DS system. Because of the move to 3D, the in-house artist Takuro Fuse was in charge of the art direction, rather than the series regular Tatsuro Iwamoto, so that they could have meetings about the art more often. This was Fuse's first work on the main series, so he initially had problems with making character designs that fit the series, and had to get a lot of feedback from Eshiro. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, they put effort into the graphics, wanting to ensure that Dual Destinies graphics <b>looked</b> <b>better</b> than those of Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.|$|E
5|$|The {{intention}} {{to create the}} racing modes of the game had been present {{from the start of}} the project and Battle Mode was developed from the desire to create a one-on-one mode where victory was not determined simply by competing for rank. The game did not start out as a Mario series game and the first prototype featured a generic man in overalls in the kart; the team decided that characters three heads tall would best suit the design of the karts. They did not decide on incorporating Mario series characters into the game until two or three months after the start of development. The choice was made after the development team, when observing how one kart looked to another driving past it, decided to see what it would look like with Mario in the kart. Thinking that having Mario in the kart <b>looked</b> <b>better</b> than previous designs, the idea of a Mario themed racing game was born.|$|E

25|$|Holyfield was {{initially}} criticized for his ongoing comeback; {{but he was}} adamant that his losses to Toney and Donald {{were the result of}} a shoulder injury, not of old age. Holyfield had <b>looked</b> <b>better</b> in his first four fights since Donald and appeared to have answered the critics who say that he lacked the cutting edge and ability to follow up on crucial openings that he had in his youth.|$|E
25|$|The 383 car {{was also}} used as the tow vehicle in the crash scene {{at the end of}} the movie. A quarter-mile cable was {{attached}} between the Challenger and an explosives-laden 1967 Chevrolet Camaro with the motor and transmission removed. The tow vehicle was driven by Loftin, who pulled the Camaro into the blades of the bulldozers at high speed. Loftin expected the car to go end over end, but instead it stuck into the bulldozers, which he thought <b>looked</b> <b>better.</b>|$|E

25|$|That {{was the end}} as far as Schofield's brief {{relationship}} with an England cap was concerned. He returned to his county, and though he was picked for another A tour to the West Indies in 2000–01 things started to fall apart shortly afterwards. In 2001 he took only 14 wickets {{at an average of}} over 54, though 26 wickets at 18.53 in List A cricket were a compensation, and although his average of 18.38 in 2002 <b>looked</b> <b>better</b> it was deceptive: Schofield was bowled only 122 first-class overs in total that summer.|$|E
25|$|Canutt {{had been}} {{perfecting}} tricks {{such as the}} Crupper Mount, a leapfrog over the horse's rump into the saddle. Douglas Fairbanks used some in his film The Gaucho. Fairbanks and Canutt became friends and competed regularly at Fairbanks' gym. Canutt took small parts in pictures to get experience. It was in Branded a Bandit (1924) that his nose was broken in a 12-foot fall from a cliff. The picture was delayed several weeks, and when it resumed, Canutt's close shots were from the side. A plastic surgeon reset the nose, which healed, inspiring Canutt to remark that he thought it <b>looked</b> <b>better.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cho {{defended the}} Honinbo title once more, which {{would lead to}} him {{defending}} {{it again and again}} until 1999. He did terribly (in Cho terms) due to not making it through to the Meijin. In the same year, more international tournaments come to be. These include the Tong Yang Cup and the Fujitsu Cup. Cho wasn't very successful in these, winning only one in 1991, the Fujitsu Cup. He lucked out in the 1991 Fujitsu Cup because his opponent Qian Yuping had health issues to pay attention to and couldn't compete in the final. He lost the Judan once more and lost the play-off of the Kisei. His record <b>looked</b> <b>better</b> when he ended with 30 wins and 17 losses. 1992 was nothing special. The only events to note are his defending of the Honinbo and losing the semi-final of the Ing Cup. Remnants of the old Cho were coming back with his 31–16 record.|$|E

25|$|Ben Land snr., private trainer to Lord Poulett at Droxford, {{had decided}} to retire in 1870, and Chris Green was persuaded {{to take his place}} in Hampshire in September 1870 where he took charge of such horses as Benazet, Cortolvin and The Lamb. He was given the task of {{preparing}} The Lamb, a little iron grey Irish horse, for a second Grand National win and during the winter 'Lord Poulett and his party were exceedingly sanguine of success, and his Lordship caused a private circular to be distributed among his friends telling them to back The Lamb to win'. For the race itself, The Lamb, unseen in public for exactly two years, was paraded by Ben Land jun. and 'was greeted with a buzz of admiration, aroused by his beautiful appearance and condition... No horse in the world could have <b>looked</b> <b>better</b> than The Lamb did'. This testament to Green's work continued in the race as The Lamb kept ahead of the pursuing horses to finally win by a couple of lengths in 'a desperately exciting finish'.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} race, the Austrian Grand Prix, Montoya finally outpaced his {{teammate}} Ralf Schumacher in qualifying {{and took a}} career-best second. It <b>looked</b> <b>better</b> and better for him {{as he took the}} lead at the start and pulled away, with second-placed Ralf holding up a string of five cars behind him. But, after 10 laps, Schumacher retired with brake failure. Montoya was struggling with the same problems, and Schumacher had been told to hold the others up so that Montoya could build a gap. With Ralf Schumacher out, the five drivers, led by Michael Schumacher began to close on Montoya at over a second a lap. Soon Schumacher was right on Montoya's tail and tried to pass him around the outside at Remus Curve. Montoya kept on the inside, braked late, locked {{up and went to the}} gravel. Schumacher was also forced to go to the gravel to avoid Montoya. Montoya rejoined seventh, just behind Schumacher. Montoya went for an early stop which solved his problems. He was set for one point in sixth until he stopped on the track with a hydraulic failure. After the race, Schumacher said that 'all Montoya was doing was to try to take Schumacher out with himself off the circuit'.|$|E
25|$|Case 2. This case {{illustrates}} autonomic status epilepticus {{with behavioral}} disturbances {{that would be}} difficult to attribute to seizure activity before the motor focal ictal events. A 6-year-old normal boy had a seizure at 4 years of age while traveling on a train with his parents who vividly described the event: “He was happily playing and asking questions when he started complaining that he was feeling sick, became very pale, and quiet. He did not want to drink or eat. Gradually, he was getting more and more pale, kept complaining that he felt sick, and became restless and frightened. Ten minutes from the onset, his head and eyes slowly turned to the left. The eyes were opened but fixed to the left upper corner. We called his name but he was unresponsive. He had completely gone. We tried to move his head but this was fixed to the left. There were no convulsions. This lasted for another 15 minutes, when his head and eyes returned to normal and he <b>looked</b> <b>better,</b> although he was droopy and really not there. At this stage he vomited once. In the ambulance, approximately 35 minutes from the onset, he was still not aware of what was going on, although he was able to answer simple questions with yes or no. In the hospital he slept for three quarters of an hour and gradually came around, but it took him another half to an hour before he became normal again”. EEG showed occipital paroxysms and MRI was normal. A similar prolonged episode, preceded by behavioral changes, occurred 8 months later at school. He received no medication. Since then he has been well.|$|E

25|$|Despite the England {{collapse}} {{the pitch}} was losing its moisture and <b>looked</b> <b>better</b> for runs. Colin McDonald and Neil Harvey saw the day out with 96/1 {{for the loss}} of Jim Burke, bowled by Statham for 3 when he left the ball alone. Lacking the pace of the Australian bowlers Statham and Loader could not make the ball lift as they had done and Trevor Bailey and Jim Laker suffered as Harvey struck 10 fours in his 60 not out by the end of New Year's Day. They returned to the fray the following morning with May setting only one slip as he tried to stop the flow of runs, which saved Harvey when he edged to the vacant second slip on 67. Bailey bowled down the leg side with a leg field while Harvey watched the balls go by, but he and McDonald were able to run quickly between the wickets and keep the score ticking over, but only 39 runs were made off 18 eight–ball overs before lunch. Soon after the break Tom Graveney took a juggled catch at first slip off Statham to dismiss McDonald for 47 after four hours. Norm O'Neill came into a defensive field to Tony Lock bowling round the wicket and found it difficult to make runs, but tried one cracking drive that was stopped by the bowler and hurt his hand. Harvey tok 267 minutes to make his century, but there was a huge roar round the giant Melbourne Ground when he reached three figures. With his hundred up he attacked Laker and Lock, but with tight fields and accurate bowling he was unable to get away. The new ball was taken after tea and Statham had O'Neill (37) caught behind trying a powerful stroke off his back foot. Peter Loader, who had been plundered for 36 runs in 8 overs bowled Harvey (167) when he missed an on–drive. Considering the quality and the accuracy of the bowling Alec Bedser thought this was Harvey's best century and it was greatly appreciated by the 71,000 crowd. They could not have enjoyed what followed as Bobby Simpson and Richie Benaud went for ducks and Australia crashed from 255/2 to 262/6. Ken Mackay (18) and Alan Davidson (25) pulled the score to 282/6 {{by the end of the}} day, but Statham (7/57) had them out in the morning, then cleaned up tail for 308. He became only the sixth England bowler to take seven wickets in a Test innings in Australia after Tom Richardson (8/94), George Lohmann (8/35 and 8/58), Wilfred Rhodes (7/56 and 8/68), Doug Wright (7/105) and Frank Tyson (7/27). Once again Neil Harvey had scored over half the innings for Australia, but they were only 49 runs ahead.|$|E

Moore viewed the photos as a chance to show off the results of her workouts: [...] "I said I would get better with each baby and I have."

500|$|Despite the {{positive}} acclaim in Halo, {{the response to}} the presence of the Flood in Halo2 and Halo3 was mixed. A panel of online reviewers noted that the Flood appeared in Halo2 for no obvious reasons, and were simply described as [...] "aggravating" [...] to play against. Similarly, reviewers including Victor Godinez of The Dallas Morning News felt that the Flood were too derivative of other sci-fi stereotypes, and functioned as [...] "space zombies". Daniel Weissenberger of Gamecritics.com noted in his review of Halo3 that even though the Flood <b>looked</b> <b>better</b> than ever, their single strategy of rushing the player proved tedious over time. GamesRadar's Charlie Barratt listed the Flood as the worst part of Halo, contrasting what he considered fun, vibrant and open levels before the Flood's appearance with confined spaces and predictable enemies.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} team {{included the}} producer Motohide Eshiro, the directors Takeshi Yamazaki and Yasuhiro Seto, and the composer Noriyuki Iwadare.

The game was generally well received by critics, who praised the visuals and character art, but criticized the game for sometimes not accepting logically valid input during trials. The game achieved the estimated sales, which were high compared to how the franchise had performed in the past.|$|E
