5000|$|To use MO-Call on smart phones, the {{application}} can be minimised {{to the background}} of the phone and will recognize international numbers and route the call onto Morodo’s network. Calls can be connected to Morodo’s network via a <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>number,</b> a call back or over an internet data channel such as Wi-Fi or 3G. SMS works by converting the text into data and then delivered via the internet connection through the Morodo network. The MO-Call app also supports VoIP calling where calls [...] are connected using Voice Over Internet Protocol.|$|E
50|$|The 1984 AT&T breakup {{gave rise}} to many small {{companies}} intent upon competing in the long distance market. These included the then-fledgling Sprint and MCI, both of whom had only recently entered the marketplace. At the time, {{there was no way}} to switch a phone line to have calls automatically carried by non-AT&T companies. Customers of these small long distance operations would be required to dial a <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>number,</b> enter their calling card number, and finally enter the area code and phone number they wish to call. Because of the relatively lengthy process for customers to complete a call, the companies kept the calling card numbers short - usually 6 or 7 digits. This opened up a huge vulnerability to phone phreaks with a computer.|$|E

5000|$|Feature Group A: The {{original}} implementation, {{in which}} a user has to dial the local telephone number of a provider's gateway, followed by (usually) a password, then the desired long-distance number. There is a different <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>number</b> in each local calling area. This requires no special capability at the local telephone company office as competing long distance providers connected using standard local lines, {{which may or may}} not support caller ID. If a carrier has no local presence, a foreign exchange line is used to reach its nearest point of presence. Once the standard means of accessing alternate long-distance carriers, local access numbers are now used primarily for low-cost prepaid calling cards as the calls may be made from any phone, at flat or local rates.|$|E
5000|$|The Exec-PC BBS {{launched}} on November 28, 1983 {{in the den}} of owner Bob Mahoney.

50|$|The {{first public}} prepaid remote memory phonecard was issued in the United States in December 1980 by Phone Line. As telecom {{industries}} {{around the world}} became deregulated, remote memory cards were issued in various countries. Remote memory phonecards can be used from any tone-mode phone and do not require special card readers. Since remote memory cards are more accessible and have lower costs, remote memory phone cards have proliferated. However, the utility of these cards is reduced by {{the large number of}} digits that need to be entered during usage. To call a long distance number, the user first dials the <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>number,</b> then keys in the secret code, followed by the actual long distance number. Based on the long distance number entered, the time remaining on the card is announced, and the call is finally processed through.|$|E

50|$|Thanks to an {{aggressive}} media marketing campaign, bundling with various consumer-oriented computers such as IBM's PS/1 and PS/2, {{as well as}} various clones and Hayes modems, the Prodigy service soon {{had more than a}} million subscribers. To handle the traffic, Prodigy built a national network of POP (points of presence) sites that made <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>numbers</b> available for most homes in the US. This was {{a major factor in the}} expansion of the service since subscribers did not have to dial long distance to access the service. The subscriber only paid for the local call (usually free), while Prodigy paid for the long distance call to its national data center in Yorktown, New York.|$|R
5000|$|It {{can also}} be made {{with the use of}} a {{telephone}} card. This way, international calls are made by first dialling to a <b>local</b> <b>access</b> telephone <b>number</b> and providing the PIN before dialling the country code together with the destination phone number. Some companies provide business solutions and accounts for businesses that are making high volumes of international calls.|$|R
5000|$|Feature Group B: Associated with 950-XXXX calling; {{instead of}} a local {{telephone}} number the user enters 950 and 4 additional digits which identify the long distance carrier. Operation {{is similar to the}} <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>numbers</b> (feature group A) except that the 950-XXXX <b>access</b> <b>number</b> is the same in every community, NANP-wide. Some exchanges send the caller's number automatically; where this service is not provided or not desired (calling card applications), the 950-XXXX number must be followed by a calling card number and the long-distance destination number. If ANI is provided, calls from the one subscribed line may be made as 950-XXXX and the long-distance destination. Largely deprecated by feature group D, but the 950 prefix and a list of carrier codes remain reserved in all North American area codes, even in Canada where most providers went from feature group A directly to 1+ default carrier dialling and feature group D (101xxxx + destination) calling without ever using 950-XXXX as a primary means to access alternate long distance carriers from home land lines.|$|R
50|$|The major phone sex {{and adult}} chat lines spend {{millions}} of dollars in advertising every month. Thanks to technology, their marketing departments can track the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns by assigning unique phone numbers to each advertising campaign, regardless if it includes TV, print, online or a combination of all these. Unique numbers might either be toll-free 1-800 <b>numbers</b> or <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>numbers</b> in order to accommodate callers who have been targeted in a local advertising campaign. Phone sex services will usually list all the local numbers on their websites. Assigning unique phone numbers to each advertising channel allows phone chat companies to measure not only the number of calls that each channel generates but also the price per call, conversion rate, and return on investment. This information can be further analyzed to determine key insights such as the most and least profitable caller's demographics, best and worst times to advertise and ultimately which advertising channels to invest more in and which ones to cut.|$|R

40|$|Data grids provide {{scalable}} {{infrastructure for}} storage resource and data files management, which support data-intensive applications {{that need to}} access to huge amount of data stored at distributed locations around the world. The size of these data can reach the scale of terabytes or even petabytes in many applications. These applications require reaching several main goals, namely efficient accessing, storing, transferring and analyzing {{a large amount of}} data in geographically distributed locations. In this situation, replication is a general and simple technique used in data grids to achieve these goals. Indeed, it has as main purposes improving data access efficiency, providing high availability, decreasing bandwidth consumption, improving fault tolerance and enhancing scalability. In this paper, we propose a new classification of replication strategies through two complementary criteria as well as a survey of the induced categories of strategies. In addition, we introduce a new decentralized periodic replication strategy for dynamic data grids assuming limited storage for replicas, called DPRSKP, which stands for Decentralized Periodic Replication Strategy based on Knapsack Problem. This strategy takes into consideration the changing availability of sites. DPRSKP is based on two polynomial-time complexity algorithms. The first one starts by selecting the best candidate files for replication while the second places them in the best locations. The replication problem in DPRSKP is formulated according to the Knapsack problem. In addition, DPRSKP extends the well known LRU and LFU strategies. The simulation experiments were carried out using OptorSim and a dynamic period rather than a static one. The obtained results show that DPRSKP can effectively improve response time, bandwidth consumption, remote file <b>accesses</b> <b>number</b> and <b>local</b> file <b>accesses</b> <b>number</b> as compared with other replication strategies...|$|R

40|$|Competition in <b>local</b> <b>access</b> {{networks}} and <b>local</b> loop unbundling have been central in the 1999 {{review of the}} EU communications regulatory framework. These issues also figure high on national policy agendas. Competition in <b>local</b> <b>access</b> is thought to stimulate internet penetration {{and the development of}} e-commerce and interactive applications, all key elements for the move towards a 'new economy'. Following an analysis of different ways to promote competition in <b>local</b> <b>access</b> {{networks and}} a review of the respective EU debate, this paper then concentrates on the relevant developments in Britain. At a broader level, it explores the interplay between EU debates and British policies and actions and the scope for harmonisation of national regulatory regimes. At a more specific level, the paper assesses the evolution of <b>local</b> <b>access</b> competition and relates this to the role of regulation and the question of facilities- vs. services-based entry. It is argued that the introduction of new market restructuring initiatives, such as local loop unbundling, requires a larger involvement by regulators, particularly in the early stages, rather than just a reliance on general competition rules.
