5|$|At episode's end, Rose, Sarah Jane, Mickey, and the Doctor are {{standing}} in the TARDIS. Sarah Jane declines a second chance of travelling in the TARDIS, having finally decided {{to move on with}} her life and stop waiting for the Doctor. Mickey says he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the TARDIS crew, a suggestion of which Sarah Jane approves. She then asks Rose to stay with the Doctor, and to find her one day if she needs to. Sarah Jane then gets a chance to part properly with the Doctor, who leaves her with a brand new K9 as a parting gift.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Labonte {{was asked}} to leave the band due to {{personal}} and artistic differences. He had ideas for a side project while {{a member of the}} band, and went on to form All That Remains. The band looked for a replacement vocalist and eventually recruited Milford, MA native Brian Fair of the pioneering metalcore band Overcast. The band had been friends with Fair for years. After a US Summer tour with Shai Hulud, Overcast disbanded and the band asked Fair if he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> Shadows Fall. While on tour Shadows Fall was signed to Century Media Records. The band recorded its second studio album Of One Blood with Fair on vocals in 2000, and the release included re-recorded songs from Somber Eyes to the Sky. In 2001, David Germain decided to leave the band due to alcoholism, and was replaced by former Stigmata and Burning Human drummer Jason Bittner.|$|E
5|$|The {{girls are}} soon {{captured}} by Fireflies, who restrain them; Marlene, {{the leader of}} the Fireflies, recognizes Ellie, and demands that she remain safe. When Riley claims she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> their group, Marlene refuses, and the two argue, resulting in Marlene threatening to shoot Riley. Ellie intervenes, demanding at gunpoint that Marlene explain how she knows information about Ellie. When Ellie finally lowers the gun, Marlene informs her that she knew Ellie's mother, and had promised her that she would take care of Ellie. Ellie hands the gun to Marlene, who says that she would tell her more about her mother in the future, before telling the girls to leave. When Ellie and Riley reenter the quarantine zone, Riley says that there is no escape. Ellie suggests running away, but Riley informs her that this will just result in death. The two then walk back into the school.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes instead {{started to}} train with A.F.C. Sudbury and {{played in a}} {{pre-season}} friendly against Bury Town, during which he scored to help Sudbury win 4–3. However, although Rhodes said he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the semi-professional Isthmian League Division One North side, {{he wanted to keep}} his options open in case he could remain in the professional game. A week later, he was given a trial with League Two Hereford United. Instead, the following week, Rhodes signed for Isthmian League Premier Division side Canvey Island and immediately went into the first-team to make his debut on 28 August in a home league match against Carshalton Athletic, which finished 1–1, with Rhodes close to scoring what would have been a late winning goal for his new club. Rhodes' first goals for Canvey Island came in a FA Cup first round qualifying match against Newport Pagnell Town, scoring twice in a 4–1 victory. He scored again in the next round to put Canvey into the third qualifying round. Rhodes signed a contract to keep him with the club {{until the end of the}} season and scored two more in Canvey's ultimate exit from the FA Cup.|$|E

Milner himself also received the loan move positively, saying that he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> Villa permanently because of the probability of becoming a regular starter, but admitted {{that the possibility of}} this happening was beyond his control.|$|E

30|$|In Fig. 1, it {{is assumed}} that the CM 6 <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> in the CH 24 from CH 22. According to the {{existing}} reassociation procedure, CH 24 validates whether CM 6 is a member of CH 22 by querying CH 22. If CH 22 replies that the CM 6 is a legitimate member, then CH 24 can complete the validation step by stating CM 6 as a legitimate member. Finally, CM 6 joins CH 24.|$|R

25|$|A node {{that would}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the net must first {{go through a}} {{bootstrap}} process. In this phase, the joining node needs to know the IP address and port of another node—a bootstrap node (obtained from the user, or from a stored list)—that is already participating in the Kademlia network. If the joining node has not yet participated in the network, it computes a random ID number that is supposed not to be already assigned to any other node. It uses this ID until leaving the network.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in {{free agency}} they signed Tim Thomas away from divisional Phoenix, in a four-year, $24million deal. That was to counter the {{defection}} of Vladimir Radmanović to the Lakers in a similar deal, except Radmanovic signed for an extra year, but both players would make {{the same amount of}} money annually, which would be $6million. Sam Cassell (widely credited as the biggest reason for the Clippers' recent success) signed a two-year, $13million deal. Cassell stated that once he retired he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the Clippers' coaching staff under Mike Dunleavy, Sr. The team also signed veteran Aaron Williams to an undisclosed deal.|$|E
25|$|A mistake, however, {{prevented}} {{the move to}} the club: when the contract had been agreed, Dalglish realised {{they did not have}} the correct paperwork needed to complete the transfer. This was on a Friday afternoon, and the office had been locked up for the weekend. With a verbal agreement in place, they agreed to meet on Monday morning to complete the transfer officially. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, hearing about the move, phoned Keane and asked whether he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> them instead of Blackburn. Ferguson ensured they had the paperwork ready and met up with Keane on the Saturday and signed for Manchester United for £3.75million, a British transfer record at the time.|$|E

500|$|A Day to Remember {{formed when}} guitarist Tom Denney asked Jeremy McKinnon {{if he would}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the band as a vocalist. The pair hung out with drummer Bobby Scruggs, who later joined the band. During this period, both Denney and Scruggs were already in a band; Denney was in 2 Days 2 Late, while McKinnon played in All for Nothing. The trio wrote a song which McKinnon said [...] "was better than {{everything}} our other bands had come up with". Shortly afterwards the trio decided to form a band which was called End of An Era in its first week of existence. The name {{was inspired by a}} movie listing in a TV guide found in Denney's home. One day at rehearsal, a friend of Scruggs showed up with his girlfriend, {{who came up with the}} band's name A Day to Remember.|$|E
500|$|Rumours of a co-headlining tour from Linkin Park and Thirty Seconds to Mars first {{circulated}} on March 3, 2014, when a Texas {{radio station}} {{revealed that the}} two [...] "modern rock icons" [...] would be partaking in a tour starting in late summer and that a performance in The Woodlands would take place on September 5. The tour was officially announced the following day, on March 4, 2014 {{at a press conference}} held at Milk Studios in Los Angeles, California with Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington from Linkin Park, and Jared Leto from Thirty Seconds to Mars. The conference was broadcast on the internet through the interactive social platform VyRT. In an interview with Billboard, Bennington explained that a co-headlining tour with Thirty Seconds to Mars {{had been a long time}} coming; Linkin Park, indeed, had polled their fans a number of times in order to identify which artist they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> them on tour and Thirty Seconds to Mars was the most sought-after band multiple times. Thirty Seconds to Mars first worked with Linkin Park in 2007, opening some European shows for the band.|$|E
2500|$|George Orwell {{fought in}} the Spanish Civil War in the militia of Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), a revolutionary Trotskyst party (and {{therefore}} opposed to the Soviet Union line) whose militants were allied with the CNT during the revolution and to which Andrés Nin belonged. Orwell described in his book Homage to Catalonia the time during which Barcelona rose up with the CNT and anarchism.

500|$|Lisa, {{despite being}} a child prodigy, often sees {{herself as a}} misfit within the Simpson family and other {{children}} due to her extremely high level of intelligence. She shows characteristics rarely seen in Springfield, including spirituality and commitment to peaceful ways, and is notably more concerned with world affairs than her life in Springfield, with her rebellion against social norms being depicted as constructive and heroic, yet she can be self-righteous at times. In [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian", an increasing sense of moral righteousness leads her to disrupt her father's roast-pig barbecue, an act for which she later apologizes. Episodes often take shots at Lisa's idealism and virtue signalling. In [...] "Bart Star", (season nine, 1997) Lisa, departs from her typically more genuine nature and apparently {{looking for a new}} cause to crusade over, defiantly declares that she, a girl, would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the football team. In the 1990s, it was considered odd to allow a girl to play football. However, when coach Ned Flanders reveals that several girls already play for the team, she hesitates and claims football is [...] "not really [...] thing". She then expresses distaste about a ball made of pig's skin, but one of the girls informs her that their footballs are synthetic and that proceeds are donated to Amnesty International. Upset by being unable to gain moral superiority, Lisa runs off.|$|E
2500|$|When Bob Dylan {{was about}} to perform at the Isle of Wight Festival in August 1969, English critic Michael Gray asked Grossman about the rumor that The Beatles might appear on-stage with Dylan.

[...] The {{contracts}} between Dylan and Grossman were officially dissolved on July 17, 1970, prompted by Dylan's earlier realization that Grossman had taken 50% of his song publishing rights in a hastily signed contract.|$|E

He then performed with Guns N' Roses for 13 shows during the band's summer European tour. Stradlin said, [...] "Axl [...] and I connected via cell phone this year, I stopped by.

I told him later I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the fun in some way and he said I was welcome to come and play something, so I did!

[...] Guitarist Ted Alexander was the band's roadie, and spent so much time with the band that they eventually [...] "just gave him a guitar". Sean McGrath, bassist on the band's first album, was kicked out of the band and replaced by Eben D'Amico. The group played gigs with local bands, one of which D'Amico was in.

On 17 August, Haider announced {{that she would not}} run for president. On 26 February 2010, Bucher said that he might run as a candidate for his party, because [...] "he could appeal to [...] voters".

2500|$|GROW is a {{peer support}} and mutual-aid {{organization}} for recovery from, and prevention of, serious mental illness. GROW {{was founded in}} Sydney, Australia in 1957 by Father Cornelius B. [...] "Con" [...] Keogh, a Roman Catholic priest, and psychiatric patients who sought help with their mental illness in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Consequently, GROW adapted many of AA's principles and practices. As the organization matured, GROW members learned of Recovery International, an organization also created to help people with serious mental illness, and integrated pieces of its will-training methods. As of 2005 {{there were more than}} 800 GROW groups active worldwide. GROW groups are open to anyone who would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>join,</b> though they specifically seek out those who have a history of psychiatric hospitalization or are socioeconomically disadvantaged. Despite the capitalization, GROW is not an acronym. Much of GROW's initial development was made possible with support from Orval Hobart Mowrer, Reuben F. Scarf, W. Clement Stone and Lions Clubs International.|$|E
