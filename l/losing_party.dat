25|$|Like the courts, arbitral tribunals {{generally}} {{have the same}} power to award costs {{in relation to the}} determination of the dispute. In international arbitration as well as domestic arbitrations governed by the laws of countries in which courts may award costs against a <b>losing</b> <b>party,</b> the arbitral tribunal will also determine the portion of the arbitrators' fees that the <b>losing</b> <b>party</b> is required to bear.|$|E
25|$|In many {{legal systems}} - both common law and civil law - it is normal {{practice}} for the courts to award legal costs against a <b>losing</b> <b>party,</b> with the winner becoming entitled to recover an approximation of what it spent in pursuing its claim (or in defense of a claim). The United States is a notable exception to this rule, as except for certain extreme cases, a prevailing party in a US legal proceeding does not become entitled to recoup its legal fees from the <b>losing</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E

25|$|Germany {{provides}} legal representation, legal advice, {{and help}} in covering court costs in civil cases {{to those who}} cannot raise the necessary funds to hire an attorney, but only {{when there is a}} reasonable chance of success. In criminal cases where the defendant faces at least one year of imprisonment, the defendant has the right to legal counsel. Although there is a right to legal defense, there is no organized public defender system. Instead, any lawyer can be appointed to provide counsel to a specific defendant, and the defendant can select a specific lawyer. Questions of payment are deferred until the end of a trial, and the court will decide the cost of the case to the <b>losing</b> <b>party.</b> The defendant will not be charged for legal services if acquitted. If convicted, the defendant will be required to pay the lawyer's expenses unless the court finds that the defendant is indigent.|$|E
500|$|Jurisdictions {{may seek}} preclearance through either an [...] "administrative preclearance" [...] process or a [...] "judicial preclearance" [...] process. If a {{jurisdiction}} seeks administrative preclearance, the Attorney General will consider whether the proposed change has a discriminatory purpose or effect. After the jurisdiction submits the proposed change, the Attorney General has 60 days to interpose an objection to it. The 60-day period may be extended an additional 60 days if the jurisdiction later submits additional information. If the Attorney General interposes an objection, then {{the change is}} not precleared {{and may not be}} implemented. The Attorney General's decision is not subject to judicial review, but if the Attorney General interposes an objection, the jurisdiction may independently seek judicial preclearance, and the court may disregard the Attorney General's objection at its discretion. If a jurisdiction seeks judicial preclearance, it must file a declaratory judgment action against the Attorney General in the U.S. District Court for D.C. A three-judge panel will consider whether the voting change has a discriminatory purpose or effect, and the <b>losing</b> <b>party</b> may appeal directly to the Supreme Court. Private parties may intervene in judicial preclearance lawsuits.|$|E

Several factors led to this poor showing, including a lacklustre campaign, Hampton's low profile, and a movement called strategic voting that endorsed voting for the Liberals in most ridings in order to remove the governing Tories. After the election, there was a short-lived attempt to remove leader Howard Hampton publicly led by leaders of the party's youth wing. [...] However, the majority of party members blamed the defeat on NDP supporters voting Liberal in hopes of removing Harris and the Tories from power. As a result, Hampton was not widely blamed for this severe defeat and stayed on as leader.|$|E

The election resulted in a five-seat swing to the Coalition, netting it a majority almost as large as in 1996. [...] It also resulted the first, albeit slim, government majority in the Senate since 1981.

He was assured of reelection on the third count, ultimately winning 53.3 percent of the two-party preferred vote.
