5|$|Although {{the number}} of dead and wounded was {{relatively}} <b>low</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> {{the extent of the}} fire, the cultural losses were huge. In addition to several private book collections, 35,000 texts including a large number of unique works were lost with the University of Copenhagen library, and at the observatory on top of Rundetårn, instruments and records made by Tycho Brahe and Ole Rømer were destroyed.|$|E

Very large female Murray cod can have egg counts as high as 80,000–90,000, although a recent, very large 33-kg specimen yielded an egg count of 110,000 viable eggs. Egg counts in female Murray cod of all sizes are relatively <b>low</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> many fish species.|$|E

According to the London St. Thomas Association of Realtors, {{the average price of}} a home in the London and St. Thomas area in 2016 is $274,383, which is substantially lower than the national average of $467,082. It is also well below the average home prices of nearby cities including Toronto ($736,670), Hamilton ($510,204), and Kitchener-Waterloo ($364,290).

5|$|The {{melting point}} of lead—at 327.5°C (621.5°F)—is very <b>low</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> most metals. Its boiling point of 1749°C (3180°F) {{is the lowest}} among the carbon group elements. The {{electrical}} resistivity of lead at 20°C is 192 nanoohm-meters, almost {{an order of magnitude}} higher than those of other industrial metals (copper at 15.43nΩ·m; gold 20.51nΩ·m; and aluminium at 24.15nΩ·m). Lead is a superconductor at temperatures lower than 7.19K; this is the highest critical temperature of all type-I superconductors and the third highest of the elemental superconductors.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Israelis drink wine in moderation, and almost always at meals or social occasions. Israelis drink about 6.5 liters of wine per person per year, which is <b>low</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> other wine-drinking Mediterranean countries, but the per capita amount has been increasing since the 1980s as Israeli production of high-quality wine grows to meet demand, especially of semi-dry and dry wines.

5|$|Breeding {{densities of}} this waxwing are {{typically}} <b>low</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> other passerines, usually {{less than ten}} birds per square kilometre (26per square mile) even in good habitat, although up to 35·6birds per square kilometre (92per square mile) {{have been found in}} Russia. One brood each year is normal. Maximum recorded ages are 5years 10months in North America and more than 13years 6months in Europe. The average life expectancy is unknown. Significant causes of death include predation, collisions with windows and cars, and poisoning by road salt consumed when drinking.|$|E

5|$|More than 40 beetle {{species have}} been {{recorded}} in common house martin nests, but most are either typical of the locality or found in the nests of other birds. The typical number of individuals, around 200, is relatively <b>low</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> other bird species (1,400 individual beetles for house sparrow, 2,000 for sand martin). The beetles {{have no effect on}} the nesting birds, and the reason for their comparatively low numbers is unknown, although the numbers of specific parasites found in house martin's nests is also quite small.|$|E
5|$|The {{crown of}} the tooth is {{triangular}} and contains six cusps, connected by low crests, that surround two prominent, low-lying fossae (basins) and a third, smaller fossa. Because {{of the complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues interpreted it as a molar; {{because of the number of}} roots, the arrangement of the cusps, and the shape of the tooth, as an upper molar; and because it tapers towards the end, as a last molar. One side, the longest, is flat and <b>low</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the others, suggesting it is the labial (outer) face. This would imply that the tooth is from the left jaw. Under this interpretation, the length of the tooth is 2.65mm, width is 2.20mm, height at the labial side is 1.05mm, and height at the lingual side is 1.30mm.|$|E
5|$|Of all Brandenburg-Prussian territories, the Electorate of Brandenburg {{was among}} the most devastated {{at the end of the}} Thirty Years' War. Already before the war, the {{population}} density and wealth in the electorate had been <b>low</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> other territories of the empire, and the war had destroyed 60 towns, 48 castles and about 5,000 villages. An average of 50% of the population was dead, in some regions only 10% survived. The rural population, due to deaths and flight to the towns, had dropped from 300,000 before the war to 75,000 thereafter. In the important towns of Berlin-Cölln and Frankfurt an der Oder, the population drop was one third and two third, respectively. Some of the territories gained after the war were likewise devastated: in Pomerania, only one third of the population survived, and Magdeburg, once among the wealthiest cities of the empire, was burned down with most of the population slain. Least hit were the Duchy of Prussia, which was only peripherally involved in the war, and Minden.|$|E
