Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 48 - 50. A {{wireless access}} point (WAP or AP) is a device that allows wireless communication devices to connect to a {{wireless local area network}} (WLAN). AP usually connects to a wired network, and can relay data between the wireless devices (such as computers or printers) and wired devices on the network. Optimal access point selection is a crucial problem in IEEE 802. 11 WLAN networks. Access points (APs) cover a certain area and provides an adequate bandwidth to the users around them. When the area to be covered is large, several APs are necessary. Furthermore in order to mitigate the adverse effects of interference between APs, multi channels are used. In this thesis, a service area is divided into demand clusters (DCs) in which number of users per DC and average traffic rates are known. Next, we calculate the congestion of each AP by using the average traffic load. With our Optimal Access Point Selection Algorithm, we balance the traffic loads in APs using a mixed integer linear programming formulation. This algorithm guarantees that each DC is assigned an AP and there is sufficient received power. Furthermore, the interference between the adjacent APs is controlled so that the received signal to interference and noise ratio at each AP satisfies a minimum level. Interference control is accomplished by using a multi-channel WLAN. In this thesis, both orthogonal (non-overlapping) and non-orthogonal (overlapping) channel assignment schemes are considered. The total interference is computed taking into account both co-channel and inter-channel interferences. The developed AP selection methodology is applied to WLAN designs for several buildings. It is observed from the designated networks that a DC shouldnot need to connect to the closest AP but it may be connected to an AP which may be farther away but less congested. DCs are assigned to APs such that all DCs are covered. The effects of the parameter such as traffic <b>load,</b> <b>receiver</b> sensitivity, number of APs, etc are also studied. Aydınlı, MustafaM.

40|$|Honey bee foragers {{transfer}} their nectar <b>loads</b> to <b>receiver</b> bees {{within the}} nest. Surprisingly, they often transfer {{to more than}} one receiver (published values range from 1. 9 to 2. 7). Several adaptive hypotheses have been proposed to explain why multiple transfer occurs. One hypothesis, information improvement, states that multiple transfer arises as an adaptive forager-driven process. Foragers use the delay in finding a receiver to assess the relative work capacities of foragers and receivers, performing recruitment dances when appropriate. Multiple transferring improves their delay information. We used a stochastic simulation model to investigate the non-adaptive partial loads hypothesis. We determined the extent to which partial crop <b>loads</b> and <b>receiver</b> filling and emptying rules (i. e. how much nectar to accept before leaving the transfer area) can cause multiple transfer. As many as 1. 9 nectar transfers per returning forager were generated within biologically realistic parameter space. We suggest that much multiple transfer arises as a non-adaptive consequence of partitioning nectar foraging between foragers and receivers, but that this will also result in foragers having better information about the relative work capacities of foragers and receivers as a useful consequence. We suggest that the number of transfers caused by partial loads could also be increased by an adaptive forager-driven effort to improve their information concerning the balance of foragers and receivers and we outline a framework wherein the information improvement hypothesis can be directly tested...|$|R

40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed January 7, 2011) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 103 - 105) Concentrating solar power systems are currently the predominant solar power technology for generating electricity at the utility scale. The central receiver system, which is a concentrating solar power system, uses a field of mirrors to concentrate solar radiation onto a receiver where a working fluid is heated to drive a turbine. The current central receiver systems operate on a Rankine cycle, which has a large demand for cooling water. This demand for water presents a challenge for the current central receiver systems as the ideal locations for solar power plants have arid climates. An alternative to the current receiver technology is the small particle receiver. The small particle central receiver {{has the potential to}} produce working fluid temperatures suitable for use in a Brayton cycle. In this thesis, a detailed numerical investigation for an axisymmetric, cylindrical small particle receiver was performed. The highly accurate Monte Carlo Ray Trace (MCRT) method was used to model the radiation heat transfer inside the receiver. A new MCRT code was developed and can accommodate spectral particle properties along with anisotropic scattering by the small particles. The MCRT program provides a source term to the energy equation. This in turn, produces a new temperature field for the MCRT program; together the equations are solved iteratively. This iteration repeats until convergence is reached for a steady temperature field. The energy equation was solved using a finite volume method assuming a simplified velocity field and an effective thermal conductivity that can account for turbulent flow conditions. The numerical model was used to investigate the effects of the particle diameter, particle mass <b>loading,</b> <b>receiver</b> wall properties, and the angular distribution of incident concentrated solar radiation on the efficiency of the receiver. In addition to investigating the receiver efficiency, the outlet temperatures of the small particle solar were also studied to confirm that the receiver can drive a Brayton cycle. The simulations of the small particle solar receiver showed outlet temperatures over 1400 K for essentially all parameters investigated. This confirms the suitability of the receiver to drive a Brayton cycle. In addition to the high outlet temperatures, the receiver efficiency was in excess of 90 percent for some cases.

40|$|Abstract — Hamming code is familier for its single-bit error {{detection}} & correction capability. To provide such a capability, it introduces 4 redundancy bits in a 7 -bit data item. These redundancy bits {{are to be}} interspersed at bit positions (n = 0, 1, 2, 3) with the original data bits. After {{error detection}} & correction, if any, the data bits have to be reassembled by removing the redundancy bits. In the proposed improvement, the redundancy bits will be appended {{at the end of}} data bits. This eliminates the overhead of interspersing the redundancy bits at the sender end and their removal at the receiver end after checking for single-bit error and consequent correction, if any. Further the effort needed in identifying the values of the redundancy bits is lower in the proposed novel method. Hamming code is normally used for transmission of 7 -bit data item. Scaling it for larger data lengths results in a lot of overhead due to interspersing the redundancy bits and their subsequent removal. In contrast, the proposed method is highly scalable without such overhead. Hence, this feature is suitable for transmission of large size data bit-streams with much lower redundancy bits per data bit ratio. In this paper we have proposed an efficient and novel Hamming Code algorithm, for finding error location and correction to optimize the <b>load</b> on <b>receiver</b> end and reduce delay in the circuit.

Previous approaches either use an ad-hoc proactive approach that does not generalize well or a sluggish reactive approach where the sending rate is only adapted based on synchronous feedback from the receiver. We address the shortcomings of such approaches using a two-step process. First, we improve the adaptivity of the reactive approach by proposing an asynchronous, fine-grained, rate-based approach. While this approach enhances performance, its limitation {{is that it is}} still reactive. Consequently, we then analyze the predictive patterns of <b>load</b> on the <b>receiver</b> and provide strong evidence that a proactive approach is not only possible, but also necessary, to achieve the best performance in dynamically varying end-host conditions...|$|R
