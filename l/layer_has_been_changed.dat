5000|$|A {{soil horizon}} is a layer {{generally}} {{parallel to the}} soil crust, whose physical characteristics differ from the layers above and beneath. Each soil type usually has three or four horizons. Horizons are defined in most cases by obvious physical features, chiefly colour and texture. These may be described both in absolute terms (particle size distribution for texture, for instance) and in terms relative to the surrounding material (i.e., [...] "coarser" [...] or [...] "sandier" [...] than the horizons above and below). The differentiation of the soil into distinct horizons is largely the result of influences, such as air, water, solar radiation and plant material, originating at the soil-atmosphere interface. Since the weathering of the soil occurs first at the surface and works its way down, the uppermost <b>layers</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> the most, while the deepest layers are most similar to the original parent material.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-Destabilization {{of clouds}} due to long-wave {{radiation}} is computed as {{the difference in}} the radiative cooling rates across the cloud layer. The changes in destabilization and cooling rates due to changes in cloud amount, cloud altitude, cloud thickness, and temperature structure of the lower <b>layer</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> assessed separately. <b>Changes</b> in cloud amount cause large changes in the destabilization value and cooling rates near the top and base of the cloud. For a given cloud layer, destabilization is less in low clouds than in middle or high clouds. The presence of an inversion is equivalent to that of a cloud layer and is associated with weak destabilization. 1...|$|R

Fortunately, most of blindness are caused are preventable if treated at appropriate time. Early detection of such retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, retinal detachment and glaucoma is very vital. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an In vivo imaging technique for cross sectional imaging of the retinal layers. An Image segmentation algorithm to analyze {{the thickness of the}} cross sectional of the retinal <b>layers</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> used.
