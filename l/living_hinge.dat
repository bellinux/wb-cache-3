50|$|A similar idea, {{also known}} as a shock mount, is found in {{furniture}} design, introduced by Charles and Ray Eames. This provides some shock absorption and serves as a <b>living</b> <b>hinge,</b> allowing the seat back to pivot.|$|E
50|$|Plastic <b>living</b> <b>hinges</b> are {{typically}} manufactured in an injection molding operation that creates all three parts {{at one time}} as a single piece, and if correctly designed and constructed, it can remain functional {{over the life of}} the part. Polyethylene and polypropylene are considered to be the best resins for <b>living</b> <b>hinges,</b> due to their excellent fatigue resistance.|$|R
50|$|A variant on the kerf bend {{can be used}} {{to create}} <b>living</b> <b>hinges</b> in laser cut wood. The {{technique}} is popular for making light-duty hinges with large radii.|$|R
25|$|As {{polypropylene}} is {{resistant to}} fatigue, most plastic <b>living</b> <b>hinges,</b> {{such as those}} on flip-top bottles, are made from this material. However, {{it is important to}} ensure that chain molecules are oriented across the hinge to maximise strength.|$|R
50|$|Tic Tacs {{were first}} {{produced}} in 1969. They are usually sold in small transparent plastic boxes with a flip-action <b>living</b> <b>hinge</b> lid. Originally, Tic Tacs were dyed specific colours for different flavours, although {{in many countries}} the transparent plastic boxes are coloured and the actual Tic Tacs are white.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Tic Tac {{introduced}} Tic Tac Chill, {{which is}} {{slightly larger than}} ordinary Tic Tacs and comes in a dual-opening packaging, using the traditional <b>living</b> <b>hinge</b> or a sliding opening {{on the front of}} the case. These come in three flavours: Exotic Cherry, Berry Blast, and Paradise Mint. Tic Tac Chill mints are also sugar-free, the Exotic Cherry ones instead of being sweetened with xylitol.|$|E
5000|$|Eclipse mints are {{packaged}} in a recyclable steel box. The {{top of the}} box (narrow end) is attached with metal hinge (a true hinge, not a <b>living</b> <b>hinge</b> like many boxed mints). The top may be opened and pushed back on the hinge {{to gain access to}} the mints. On opening the box the tagline [...] "powerful fresh breath" [...] is revealed, printed on a raised metal plate on the inner surface of the lid.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{approach}} to fabricating complex 3 D shapes via physical deformation of simpler shapes. Our focus is on ob-jects composed {{of a set of}} planar beams and joints, where the joints are thin parts of the object which temporarily become <b>living</b> <b>hinges</b> when heated, close to a fixed angle defined by the local shape, and then become rigid when cooled. We call this class of objects Melta-bles. We present a novel algorithm that computes an optimal joint sequence which approximates a 3 D spline curve while satisfying fabrication constraints. This technique is used in an interactive Meltables design tool. We demonstrate a variety of Meltables, fab-ricated with both 3 D-printing and standard PVC piping. ...|$|R
50|$|Funnels {{are usually}} made of {{stainless}} steel, aluminium, glass, or plastic. The material used in its construction should be sturdy {{enough to withstand}} {{the weight of the}} substance being transferred, and it should not react with the substance. For this reason, stainless steel or glass are useful in transferring diesel, while plastic funnels are useful in the kitchen. Sometimes disposable paper funnels are used in cases where {{it would be difficult to}} adequately clean the funnel afterwards (for example, in adding motor oil to a car). Dropper funnels, also called dropping funnels or tap funnels, have a tap to allow the controlled release of a liquid. A flat funnel, made of polypropylene, utilizes <b>living</b> <b>hinges</b> and flexible walls to fold flat.|$|R
40|$|When {{performing}} {{minimally invasive}} interventions, surgeons use grippers to grip and manipulate tissue. These grippers generally {{rely on their}} toothed profile and require pinching of the tissue for sufficient grip, entailing a risk of tissue damage. An solution should be found for this risk of damage. An alternative could be to manipulate the tissue without pinching or even touching it. Contactless gripping exists in the industrial field by using the principle of Bernoulli. This study explores the possibility of applying Bernoulli gripping for tissue manipulation during minimally invasive surgery. A medical gripper using the principle of Bernoulli was developed. Increasing the air flow, the radius of the gripper face and the radius of the nozzle has {{a positive effect on}} the lifting force. In order to prevent tissue damage, different variants are tested that change the direction of the air flow. In an exploring experiment, a deflector was selected out of seven variants as best solution to prevent damage from the air flow. The Bernoulli gripper was made expandable and collapsible for insertion {{in the body of the}} patient with a system of <b>living</b> <b>hinges.</b> The effect of Venturi channels and the position of a membrane for an airtight surface on the lifting force were tested. The lifting force generated on the object during gripping was measured using a tensile-strength tester. Bernoulli’s theory was compared to the results of the experiments and a discrepancy was found between theory and results. This study shows that a Bernoulli gripper is feasible to lift flexible tissue. BMEBioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|A <b>living</b> <b>hinge</b> {{is a thin}} {{flexible}} hinge (flexure bearing) made from the same material as the two rigid pieces it connects, rather than cloth, leather, or some other flexible substance. It is typically thinned or cut to allow the rigid pieces to bend {{along the line of}} the hinge. The minimal friction and very little wear in such a hinge makes it useful in the design of microelectromechanical systems, and the low cost and ease of manufacturing makes them quite common in disposable packaging.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{extend the}} {{principles}} of the freedom and constraint topologies (FACT) synthesis approach such that designers can analyze and synthesize serial flexure elements—not to be confused with serial flexure systems. Unlike serial systems, serial ele-ments do not possess intermediate rigid bodies within their geometry and thus avoid the negative effects of unnecessary mass and underconstrained bodies that generate uncon-trolled vibrations. Furthermore, in comparison with other common parallel flexure ele-ments such as wire, blade, and <b>living</b> <b>hinge</b> flexures, serial elements can be used within flexure systems to achieve (i) a larger variety of kinematics, (ii) more dynamic and elasto-mechanic versatility, and (iii) greater ranges of motion. Here, we utilize {{the principles of}} FACT to intuitively guide designers in visualizing a multiplicity of serial flexure element geometries that can achieve any desired set of degrees of freedom (DOFs). Using this approach, designers can rapidly generate a host of new serial flexure elements for syn-thesizing advanced flexure systems. Thirty seven serial flexure elements are provided as examples, and three flexure systems that consist of some of these elements are synthesized as case studies. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4028727...|$|E
40|$|Vybraným tématem mé bakalářské práce bylo téma individuální. Důvodem tohoto výběru bylo více zabřednutí do problematiky navrhování produktů a jeho následná realizace. Svojí bakalářskou práci jsem stavěl od základu na využití principů {{technologie}} zvané: <b>Living</b> <b>hinge.</b> Takto technologie umožňuje tvarování dřevěného masivu bez použití technologicko průmyslových postupů. Tímto lze vytvořit nízkonákladakový produkt s velkým důrazem na jeho estetické kvality. ObhájenoAt our univerzity {{we usually}} get two possibilities {{how to choose}} topic for final project. The first way {{how to do that}} is to choose main topic from univerzity schedule. This schedule is quite the same every single year so that's one of the reason why I haven't been choosen any of them. I didn't like the idea to work on something what doesn't make sence for my goals. I wanted to work on some real project. It was always my dream to design something for TON Czech Republic. It's the biggest czech furniture manufacture and I really appreciate what they actually do. So I got a chance to work with TON Design Lab which was a consultant for my project. We agreed to create some concept prototype which I made by myself. Since last year I have been working on a lightning concept us- ing custom <b>living</b> <b>hinge</b> technology. This technology enable banding wood without using steam or long time technology process. First I've designed prototype of flat light and through this knowledge of tech- nology I developed new approach how to bend wood. That was the major idea for my final project. I've created design set of chair and a table for small offices or dining rooms. I really like the history about Charles and Ray Eames office. Their work inspired me in many cas- es. This project is reflecting their approaches and structures how to make product. Their wisdom "learning by doing" is the best descrip- tion for every single step what i did. I've designed chair called NET because of main aesthetic and funcional detail of all design. The net of cuts enable me to form solid desk of beech wood in critical angles. Main inspiration for my chair was furniture design from 1960 ' as was Wire chair and Ant chair. The reason was to create aesthetic and comfortable design with easy manufacture. 16 This first protype is real scale model using modern and also traditional woodcraft technology. In my opinion it fits to modern and minimalisthic interiors and as same as Eames furniture, is cheap to manufacture compare with other technologies. Design of the table was designed for modern, small offices or home offices. Actually on market exist home lead businesses which needs to use new kind of furniture. I've designed easthetic design of the table which fits to modern home interiors. This design is us- ing the same detail of groove. Also I was thinking about storage and shelf spaces so I've decide to build these into desk itself. All of these together makes this product unique on the market. For final presentation I've made first protype of chair and visu- alization of the table. Made complete set would be too expensive in this situation. I've sucessfully made the most difficult part so hypo- thetically this project is ready for manufacture...|$|E
40|$|Living lab environments {{are often}} {{promoted}} {{as a way}} to engage private companies, citizens, researchers, and public organizations in mutually beneficial learning. Based on an in-depth case study of a four-year living lab collaboration in gerontechnology, we agree that successful <b>living</b> lab development <b>hinges</b> on learning between the parties, yet its emergence cannot be presumed or taken for granted. Diverse competences and interests of participating actors often make technology development projects complicated and volatile. The study describes two specific challenges faced in a living lab project: i) power issues between the actors and ii) end-user reluctance to participate in the development of new technology. Despite the hardships, we suggest that the living lab environment worked as a catalyst for learning between users and developers. Nevertheless, realizing the benefits of this learning may be more challenging than is usually expected. Learning for interaction is needed before effective learning in interaction is possible...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} on the sources of living standards divergence among Irish regional authority areas during the ?Celtic Tiger? boom period of the 1990 s, which {{has been associated with}} unbalanced regional development. The paper shows that strong regional living standards divergence during this period was driven both by the emergence of the ?demographic dividend? and by productivity. Productivity divergence was, in turn, driven by the manufacturing sector. Although structural change had a convergent effect on productivity in previous decades, this effect was negligible during the ?Celtic Tiger? boom. The discussion then considers the appropriate response to Ireland?s regional policy dilemma, namely how {{to address the problem of}} regional imbalance without compromising national growth and competitiveness. At the beginning of the new millennium, regional policy is back on the agenda with the inclusion of balanced regional development as a key objective in the National Development Plan: 2000 - 06. However, delays in the formulation of the National Spatial Strategy gives rise to concern. Based on the results of the paper, it is argued that future growth in regional and therefore national <b>living</b> standards <b>hinges</b> on continued productivity growth in internationally competitive industries based in Irish regions, as demographic factors and structural change are unlikely to continue playing prominent roles. It recommends that policy be targeted at improving regional growth and competitiveness in regional authority areas, rather than aiming for balanced regional development...|$|R
