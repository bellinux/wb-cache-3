500|$|He often played {{supporting}} roles, {{rather than}} the lead part. He said [...] "throughout my career, I've never been a huge star, but I've made steady progress and that's the way I like it," [...] and [...] "It's fun coming in as {{the second or third}} lead. If the movie or TV show bombs, you aren't to blame." [...] Hartman was considered a [...] "utility player" [...] on SNL with a [...] "kind of Everyman quality" [...] which enabled him to appear in the majority of sketches, often in very distinct roles. Jan Hooks stated of his work on SNL: [...] "Phil never had an ounce of competition. He was a team player. It was a privilege for him, I believe, to play support and do it very well. He was never insulted, no matter how small the role may have been." [...] He was disciplined in his performances, studying the scripts beforehand. Hooks added: [...] "Phil knew how to listen. And he knew how to <b>look</b> <b>you</b> in the eye, and he knew the power of being able to lay back and let somebody else be funny, and then do the reactions. I think Phil was more of an actor than a comedian." [...] Film critic Pauline Kael declared that [...] "Phil Hartman and Jan Hooks on Saturday Night Live are two of the best comic actors I've ever seen." ...|$|E
500|$|A black marketeer {{who makes}} a living dealing Kaiju organs. Perlman stated, [...] "I {{actually}} think this character {{was designed to be}} played by another ethnicity other than myself. And somewhere along the way, [...] had the notion, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.' So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's really, you know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character… I'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona… which makes him even more full of shit. And I think that's the charm of the guy—that he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down." [...] Pacific Rim marks Perlman's fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated: [...] "I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he's from Brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you know the whole story… That's all I need to know. If it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that <b>look,</b> <b>you</b> can make your own story and it'll be as compelling as anything I can invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience." [...] The bird tattoos on Chau's fingers indicate his past as a gangster. In the film, Chau states he took the name from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn. Del Toro drew inspiration from Burt Lancaster's performance in Elmer Gantry when writing the character.|$|E

2500|$|Crespin's {{international}} {{career began}} {{when she was}} chosen by Wieland Wagner to portray the role of Kundry in Wagner's Parsifal at the 1958 Bayreuth Festival, {{despite the fact that}} she had never sung Wagner in German. To learn the role in German, she was coached by Lou Bruder, a professor of German literature who later became her husband. When Crespin first auditioned for Wieland she had initially assumed that he would cast her in what the French call les wagnériennes blondes, roles like Elsa, Eva, Sieglinde, and Elisabeth. She was therefore surprised when she was asked to tackle Kundry. Crespin recalls that when she expressed her surprise to Wieland he dismissed the other roles, saying, [...] "Oh, those dummies, I don't like them. <b>Look,</b> <b>you</b> are not born for that, you have a better job to do." [...] Crespin essayed the task and her performance was so well liked that she was invited to sing Kundry again for the 1959 and 1960 Bayreuth Festivals. She returned to the Bayreuth Festival again in 1961 to sing Sieglinde in Wagner's Die Walküre and the third norn in Wagner's Götterdämmerung.|$|E
2500|$|The crowd departs: (Duet, Norma and Pollione: In mia man alfin tu sei / [...] "At last {{you are in}} my hands; no one can {{cut your}} bonds. I can"). Norma demands that he forever shun Adalgisa; only then will she release him and never see him again. He refuses, and she vents her anger by telling him that she will then kill her children. [...] "Strike me instead", he demands, [...] "so that only I alone will die", but she quickly asserts that not only will all the Romans die, but so will Adalgisa, who has broken her vows as a priestess. This prompts him to plead for her life. (Cabaletta: Norma and Pollione: Già mi pasco ne' tuoi sguardi / [...] "Already I take {{pleasure}} in the <b>look</b> <b>you</b> give me, your grief and in her death; at last I can make you as miserable as I".) When Pollione demands the knife, she calls the priests to assemble. Norma announces {{that it would be}} better to sacrifice a priestess who has broken her vows, and orders the pyre to be lit. Oroveso demands to know who is to be sacrificed while Pollione demands that she keep silent, but Norma then reveals that it is she who is to be the victim because she is the guilty one, a high Priestess who has broken her vows, has become involved with the enemy, and has borne his children. (Aria, Norma to Pollione: Qual cor tradisti / [...] "May this awful moment now show you the heart you betrayed and lost"; Duet: Norma and Pollione; Ensemble, Norma, Oroveso, Pollione, Druids, Priests: each expresses his/her sorrow, anger, pleas to Norma, with Oroveso learning for the first time that Norma is a mother.) ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the final}} {{dramatic}} scene involving Harcourt's demise, the rigged effects were handled in two stages. The first stage involved a dissolving head and body, {{while the second}} stage incorporated a flesh-less arm thrusting out of seawater. Rosengrant noted, [...] "While the dissolving makeup had to look extreme, it also had to appear realistic {{within the limits of}} the alien anatomy Winston's crew had designed. We wanted to avoid the amorphous 'blob-of-blood' <b>look</b> <b>you</b> see in so many of these slasher and monster pictures. We {{wanted to be able to}} see Harcourt's bone structure rather than just the glob hanging off of it." [...] For the visual appearance he added, [...] "Of course, we did use methocel slime to make it wet and nasty-looking, but the basic understructure was rooted in anatomy." [...] For Harcourt's facial disintegration, the coordinators came up with a foam rubber base makeup superimposed with a layer of gelatin appliances. Elek explained, the crew [...] "dug out chunks from the foam rubber pieces, filled the holes with Bromo Seltzer, then laid the gelatin appliances over the whole thing and colored them so you could not see the holes below. Once the stuntman, the camera and everyone else was in position, we took a large syringe filled with hot water and injected it into each of the Bromo Seltzer pockets as the camera started rolling. As the Bromo Seltzer started to fizzle, the hot water began eating its way through the gelatin skin and his face appeared to bubble and melt." [...] In the end, Mahan remarked, [...] "We figured that going from something like the alien queen in Aliens to these straight prosthetic makeups would be simple, but it was really a lot of work." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 20 March 2008 Daly {{introduced}} a resolution which criticized {{the human rights}} record of China and urged officials representing San Francisco during the upcoming Olympic torch ceremonies (scheduled for 9 April 2008) to [...] "make publicly known that the 2008 Summer Games torch is received with alarm and protest." [...] Daly's resolution was covered extensively by the local media and elevated the issues of treatment of protests {{in relation to the}} Olympics being held in China, the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay and the torch ceremonies being held in San Francisco, the only North American stop. The torch relay {{will be the first time}} in Olympics history that protests will accompany the torch as it passes through a U.S. city. [...] Daly stated, [...] "he magnitude of attention paid to the Olympic Games and the torch relay makes the event the appropriate platform to discuss human rights. If someone can <b>look</b> <b>you</b> in the face and tell you the Olympics are limited to the individual competitions that take place, well, that's a good poker player." [...] Daly also criticized the rare decision to set up designated [...] "free-speech zones" [...] stating, [...] "I don't see why we should break from our pattern of how we handle mass protests or demonstrations for China." [...] San Francisco mayor, Gavin Newsom, said he has [...] "very serious concerns" [...] about the situation in Tibet but added San Francisco is [...] "privileged" [...] to be the torch's only stop in North America and that the event should rise above political concerns and that the Games should be a time [...] "to focus on the things that unite us and not divide us." [...] In a later committee meeting supervisors Carmen Chu and Sean Elsbernd amended the resolution to welcome the Global Human Rights Torch Relay on April 5 and the Tibetan Freedom Torch on April 8 and commend [...] "their efforts to raise awareness regarding human rights violations in China and urging the San Francisco City Representatives ... to welcome the Torch in the explicit spirit of Olympism, consistent with the United Nations Charter ... and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights." ...|$|E
