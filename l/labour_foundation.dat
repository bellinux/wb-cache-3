40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to present and analyse the {{alternatives}} to downsizing of employees {{from the point of}} view of the active employment policy applied in Austria during the financial and economic crisis 2008 - 2010. First, the paper explores downsizing in the period of economic crisis and compares legal forms of employment termination in Austria and in the Czech Republic, as well as other relevant legal topics. Furthermore, it points out some selected issues from austrian labour law. Second, the thesis focuses on active employment policy tools which aim to avoid downsizing at least for the temporary, short-time economic crisis and on tools which at least ease consequences of downsizing by helping the fired employee to find a new employment path. The thesis analyses the evolution, legal background and use of short working time in detail, as well as the background of educational leave. Eventually, the paper deals with a revolutionary version of outplacement [...] with <b>labour</b> <b>foundations</b> [...] an outplacement model developed in Austria...|$|R

However, shortly after demolition works to the old Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange, the old contractor went bust, thus the site remained abandoned for two years. Meanwhile, the Singapore <b>Labour</b> <b>Foundation</b> (the then owner of AMK Hub) made changes to the proposed development, from a mixed used development to a small shopping complex, which will host a hypermarket, a new air-conditioned bus interchange, an 8-screen cinema, and more than 100 specialty shops.

40|$|The {{research}} {{topic is}} {{the making of}} socio-economic policy in the Netherlands during the period 1949 - 1958 The making of this policy is studied as an interplay of forces, the outcome of which is determined by cabinets, political parties, social partners and other special interest organizations, and by advisory or official bodies like the Social and Economic Council (SER), the <b>Labour</b> <b>Foundation</b> (SvdA), the Central Planning Bureau (CPB), and the Bank of the Netherlands (DNB).

40|$|This study {{sets out}} to {{describe}} and explain variation in cross-level policy coherence between central level policy recommendations by the Stichting van de Arbeid (Dutch <b>Labour</b> <b>Foundation)</b> and decentral level Collective Labour Agreements (CLAs) in Dutch labour relations. Cross-level policy coherence {{can be understood as}} a problem of policy implementation. However, Dutch labour relations are characterised by a combination of (a) multilevel governance – collective decision-making takes place on both the central and decentral level, and (b) soft policy – <b>Labour</b> <b>Foundation</b> recommendations are not legally binding. These characteristics raise two important questions: (1) to what extent can we expect decentral compliance with central level recommendations, and under what conditions? (2) To what extent are existing theories of policy implementation that assume state centric systems – which are characterised by binding political decisions and institutionally embedded systems of administrative procedures for political control – appropriate for the study of multilevel systems with ‘soft’ policies? To explain cross-level policy coherence a model-guided approach is applied. The starting point is the standard model of policy implementation. This model is adjusted and supplemented using ‘middle range theories’ on policy processes in multilevel systems. Cross-level policy coherence is defined as coherence between central level recommendations and the individual (policy positions, concessions in negotiations) and collective outcomes (negotiation agenda, CLA-arrangements) of choices of decentral level CLA-negotiators. Hypotheses are derived, predicting effects on cross-level policy coherence of (1) collective support for recommendations among peak organization administrators, (2) preference loss of individual peak organization administrators in the central level negotiations, and (3) government salience. To test the hypotheses two types of data are analysed: (1) decision-making data on (a) central level recommendations in two different social pacts, and (b) eight CLAs, and (2) longitudinal data on the presence of 75 types of arrangements about employability and work-life balance in 138 CLAs reached in the period 1996 - 2003. It was found that <b>Labour</b> <b>Foundation</b> recommendations have more than a symbolic effect. When CLA-negotiators hold a position that is not in accordance with a central level recommendation {{they are more likely to}} make concessions during the negotiations, than when they hold a position that is in accordance with a recommendation. In addition, the preferences and priorities of government affect decision-making processes between employers and employees, both at the central and decentral levels. The adjusted model of implementation in Dutch labour relations, which assumes that actors trade off preference loss and reputation loss, proves to be useful for future research. However, the composition of preference loss functions and reputation loss functions might need to be adjusted and supplemented. Furthermore, the effects of collective support among peak organization administrators, individual preference loss of peak organization administrators, and government salience should be tested using a larger and more consistent dataset. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{has not had}} any noticeable effect on the peak-level associational ‘landscape’: the landscape has remained densely organised. The six peak social partner associations are still in place and are respected parties in consultation. These national organisations have an advisory role in collective labour framework agreements and offer indications for wage development - via the bipartite <b>Labour</b> <b>Foundation,</b> the STAR. Consultation by the authorities is further guaranteed through the tripartite Social Economic Council, the SER. The relationship with the government has in recent years become more difficult. Collective bargaining negotiations have also become tenser. That said, around 80 % of all employees are covered by a collective agreement. These agreements are concluded by the unions and employer associations affiliated to the six national peak organisations. While around 90 % of employers are organised {{by one of the}} three national employer organisations, employee federations organise at present around 20 % of employees...|$|E
