5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} released for the Amiga and Atari ST in 1991, running at a display resolution of 320×200 pixels. These versions received less play-testing than other versions, making for a less-fluid game, but the Amiga's sound capabilities afford it a high sound quality compared to contemporary ports. The game released on the Atari ST is identical, {{but with a}} less refined sound, and its colors are less sharp than on Amiga. These versions had code wheel protection that {{made it difficult to}} use unauthorized copies, forcing the player to enter a code (series of figures) <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> a code wheel that came with the game. The player had to turn the wheel according to the number that was requested in the screen whenever the game is loaded in order to reload the game. Another small change between the Amiga and ST versions and the others was that Lester would yell as he grabs the vine in the first area if he was not being chased by the beast in these versions; this feature was omitted from most other versions.|$|E
2500|$|A once common {{programming}} optimization, used {{especially in}} 3D graphics, was to pre-calculate {{a table of}} sine values, for example one value per degree. This allowed results to be <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> a table rather than being calculated in real time. With modern CPU architectures this method may offer no advantage.|$|E
2500|$|After Hitler's 29 August 1944 {{declaration}} {{to begin}} V-2 attacks {{as soon as}} possible, the offensive began on 8 September 1944 with a single launch at Paris, which caused modest damage near Porte d'Italie. Two more launches by the 485th followed, including one from The Hague against London {{on the same day}} at 6:43p.m. – the first landed at Staveley Road, Chiswick, killing 63-year-old Mrs. Ada Harrison, 3-year-old Rosemary Clarke, and Sapper Bernard Browning on leave from the Royal Engineers, and one that hit Epping with no casualties. [...] Upon hearing the double-crack of the supersonic rocket (London's first ever), Duncan Sandys and Reginald Victor Jones <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> different parts of the city and exclaimed [...] "That was a rocket!", and a short while after the double-crack, the sky was filled with the sound of a heavy body rushing through the air.|$|E

2500|$|At first {{all went}} well. Panjandrum {{rolled into the}} sea and began {{to head for the}} shore, the Brass Hats {{watching}} through binoculars from the top of a pebble ridge [...] Then a clamp gave: first one, then two more rockets broke free: Panjandrum began to lurch ominously. It hit a line of small craters in the sand and began to turn to starboard, careering towards Klemantaski, who, viewing events through a telescopic lens, misjudged the distance and continued filming. Hearing the approaching roar he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his viewfinder to see Panjandrum, shedding live rockets in all directions, heading straight for him. As he ran for his life, he glimpsed the assembled admirals and generals diving for cover behind the pebble ridge into barbed-wire entanglements. Panjandrum was now heading back to the sea but crashed on to the sand where it disintegrated in violent explosions, rockets tearing across the beach at great speed.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{longtime}} Bulger confidant Kevin Weeks, Bulger's {{murder of}} Paul McGonagle's brother {{led directly to}} the Mullin Gang's assassination of his mentor. According to Weeks,"One day while the gang war was still going on, Jimmy was driving down Seventh Street in South Boston when he saw Paulie driving toward him. Jimmy pulled up beside him, window to window, nose to nose, and called his name. As Paulie looked over, Jimmy shot him right between the eyes. Only at that moment, just as he pulled the trigger, Jimmy realized it wasn't Paulie. It was Donald, the most likable of the McGonagle brothers, {{the only one who}} wasn't involved in anything. Jimmy drove straight to Billy O'Sullivan's house on Savin Hill Avenue and told Billy O, who was at the stove cooking, 'I shot the wrong one. I shot Donald.' Billy <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the stove and said, 'Don't worry about it. He wasn't healthy anyway. He smoked. He would have gotten lung cancer. How do you want your pork chops?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, Santa Claus {{had three}} tiny, poorly {{maintained}} A-frame buildings painted to represent peppermint candies. American writer Mark Winegardner described Santa Claus {{at that time}} as being on its last legs. Additionally, Winegardner noted in his 1988 book Elvis Presley Boulevard: From Sea to Shining Sea, Almost, that"Styrofoam silver bells, strands of burned-out Christmas lights and faded plastic likenesses of Old Saint Nick garnished this little village. A lopsided, artificial twenty-foot tree whistled in the wind beside a broken Coke machine and an empty ice freezer. Two of the three buildings were padlocked; through their windows, encrusted with layers of sand and decade-old aerosol snow, ... I saw dusty, overturned fiberglass statuettes of elves and reindeer. Alongside the SANTA CLAUS, ARIZONA/ESTABLISHED 1937 sign was another: FOR SALE BY OWNER/$52,500/INQUIRE AT GIFTSHOP. An arrow pointed the way.""The gift shop stocked no seasonal items. Its shelves were littered with flea-market [...] at antique-shop prices. Battered paperbacks cost a buck. What little money the place generated must {{have come from the}} short-ordered grill and the soft-drinks cooler. On a stool behind the countertop cash register, a haggard, fiftyish man <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his circle-the-word puzzle and asked if we needed anything." ...|$|E
