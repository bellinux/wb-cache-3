On angtography, the incidence of vessel perforation (1 in 10 versus 3 in 10) and abrupt vessel closure (0 in 10 versus 2 in 10) was less with excimer compared with <b>thermal</b> <b>laser</b> angioplasty. Macroscopically, there was a greater incidence of mural and occlusive thrombus formation after <b>thermal</b> <b>laser</b> than after pulsed excimer laser angioplasty.

5000|$|The <b>laser</b> <b>thermal</b> rocket is {{a thermal}} rocket {{in which the}} {{propellant}} is heated by energy provided by an external laser beam. [...] The beam heats a solid heat exchanger, which in turn heats an inert liquid propellant, converting it to hot gas which is exhausted through a conventional nozzle. This is similar in principle to nuclear thermal and solar thermal propulsion. Using a large flat heat exchanger allows the laser beam to shine directly on the heat exchanger without focusing optics on the vehicle. The HX thruster {{has the advantage of}} working equally well with any laser wavelength and both CW and pulsed lasers, and of having an efficiency approaching 100%. The HX thruster is limited by the heat exchanger material and by radiative losses to relatively low gas temperatures, typically 1000 - 2000 C. For a given temperature, the specific impulse is maximized with the minimum molecular weight reaction mass, and with hydrogen propellant, that provides sufficient specific impulse as high as 600 - 800 seconds, high enough in principle to allow single stage vehicles to reach low Earth orbit. The HX laser thruster concept was developed by Jordin Kare in 1991; a similar microwave thermal propulsion concept was developed independently by Kevin L. Parkin at Caltech in 2001.|$|E
