5|$|I never {{warmed up}} ten, fifteen minutes {{before a game}} like most {{pitchers}} do. I'd <b>loosen</b> <b>up,</b> three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at the 30 Rock studios, after overhearing Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) impersonating Elmo from Sesame Street while Pete was {{encouraging}} {{his son to}} do better with his potty training, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) compares Pete's relationship with his wife to that of Samson and Delilah. While working late at night in his office, Tracy enters with Grizz (Grizz Chapman) and Dot Com (Kevin Brown) {{and a couple of}} other people, which turns into a party. Pete is still working, while Tracy's entourage enjoy themselves. Tracy encourages Pete to <b>loosen</b> <b>up,</b> and asks one of the women, Vicki (April Lee Hernández), to look after him. Pete finally loosens up and begins to give in to Vicki's temptations, but NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) sets him straight, telling him to recall the day that he got married.|$|E

25|$|Several {{mechanical}} techniques {{are used to}} dislodge sputum and encourage its expectoration. In the hospital setting, chest physiotherapy is used; a respiratory therapist percusses an individual's chest by hand several times a day, to <b>loosen</b> <b>up</b> secretions. Chest physiotherapy is beneficial for short-term airway clearance. Devices that recreate this percussive therapy include the ThAIRapy Vest and the intrapulmonary percussive ventilator. Other methods such as biphasic cuirass ventilation, and associated clearance mode available in such devices, integrate a cough assistance phase, {{as well as a}} vibration phase for dislodging secretions. These are portable and adapted for home use.|$|E

25|$|As captain against Frank Worrell's West Indian cricket team in England in 1963 Dexter {{was able}} to <b>loosen</b> <b>up</b> after the Ashes and they played an {{exciting}} Test series. After losing the First Test, in the Second Test at Lord's England's first innings rested heavily on Dexter's hard-hitting 70 off 75 balls when he took on the West Indian fast bowlers Charlie Griffith and Wes Hall in an innings that was remembered by all who saw it. In the second innings Colin Cowdrey came out to bat with a broken arm with victory, defeat or a tie still possible {{in the last two}} balls, but David Allen blocked them for a draw. England levelled the series in the Third Test thanks to Dexter (4/38 and 1/7) and Fred Trueman (5/75 and 7/44), but lost the last two Tests and the series. In 1964 Dexter was again in charge in the rain-soaked 1964 Ashes series. Famously in the decisive Third Test at Headingley he removed the off-spinner Fred Titmus after he had taken three wickets to reduce Australia to 187/7, still 81 runs behind England. Dexter took the new ball and gave it to Fred Trueman who bowled a series of bouncers which Peter Burge hooked and pulled to 160, hoisting Australia to 389 and a 7 wicket win. Although the change made sense as the new batsman Neil Hawke was fragile against fast bowling and Trueman, the greatest wicket-taker in the world at the time, was playing on his home ground Dexter was heavily criticised for a decision which obviously lost the series. In the Fourth Test Australia made 656/8, but thanks to a stand of 246 between Ken Barrington (256) and Dexter (174) England reached 611 and avoided defeat. It {{was the first time that}} two teams had made 600 runs in an innings in a Test, and their fortunes gripped the cricketing nation, but the inevitable draw meant that Australia retained the Ashes. As some consolation Dexter led Sussex to the finals of the Gillette Cup in 1963 and 1964, and won both, the first trophies in the county's history.|$|E

I always want to go one way, and George goes another way, but we each took turns trading off, giving and taking. George tends to be very action-oriented and he cuts dialogue quite tight; I tend to cut looser, and go for more lyrical pauses, which can slow the story. So, I <b>loosen</b> <b>up</b> his tightness, and he tightens my looseness." ...|$|E

[...] Leah Greenblat of Entertainment Weekly also spotted the Def Leppard influence on [...] "Hands All Over".
