5|$|Maureen Ryan {{believed}} {{that one of}} the reasons the episode worked so well was because it <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> storylines with the Night's Watch and the Dothraki and focused in a single location. VanDerWerff agreed, and added that with each episode the writers got bolder in the sense that they added new scenes not included in the book to round out the source material.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{defensive}} injury crisis at the club, Carrick started the 2012–13 season as a makeshift centre-back.

He continued in the role for the next match against Fulham. He scored his first goal of the season in a 1–0 Champions League victory against Galatasaray, after series of ball movement leading to Michael Carrick rounding the goalkeeper to score with his left foot. On 24 November 2012, Carrick was <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> squad that defeated QPR 3–1, ending his run of 33 consecutive league starts.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus... was {{the most}} eminent naturalist of his time, a wide observer, a close thinker; but the {{atmosphere}} in which he lived and moved and had his being was saturated with biblical theology, and this permeated all his thinking....

25|$|Traditionally, in two handed bowling, {{two fingers}} are {{inserted}} into the ball with the thumb <b>left</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> dominant hand is then used to cradle the ball and creates extra spin on the release. Then, the opposite hand is used to guide the ball through the throwing motion, with the ball delivered shovel-style. Two handed bowlers are forced to flex forward farther and rotate their hips {{more than a single}} handed bowler. These bowlers are placing more torque through the spine in order to increase the ball speed and revolution rate. This form of bowling, if done correctly, increases force, revolutions and pin carry. A two handed bowler's revolution rate can reach up to 700 revolutions per minute, which is up to 17% more rotation than the nearest elite single handed bowler and twice what some top professional bowlers generate.|$|E
25|$|At Sacrifice, Daniels and Kazarian cost Styles his {{match against}} Kurt Angle, who however saved Styles from a beatdown.

At Slammiversary, Styles and Angle defeated Daniels and Kazarian to win their TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the following episode of Impact Wrestlig, Styles entered the 2012 Bound for Glory Series, where he was eliminated in opening gauntlet match by Daniels. On the June 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, Styles and Carter revealed their secret – they were not having an affair, but were helping an addicted pregnant woman named Claire Lynch overcome her problems. The following week on Impact Wrestling, Styles and Angle lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship back to Daniels and Kazarian, after which Daniels admitted that Styles and Carter had told the truth about Claire, but claimed that they had <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> part about Styles being {{the father of her}} unborn baby.
