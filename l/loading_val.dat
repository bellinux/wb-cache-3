Understanding {{effective}} parameters in {{fatigue crack}} growth (FCG) model under variable amplitude <b>loading</b> (<b>VAL)</b> is of eminent importance theoretically {{as well as}} experimentally. In response to this necessity, a systematic study of different analytical concepts and loading sequences {{in order to gain}} a practical framework has been proposed. The theoretical background related to the fatigue life prediction by using FCG model has been presented. This has shown the rationale of why we need to calculate local stress-strain in the crack tip in developing FCG models which is the main subject of this research...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPredicting {{fatigue crack}} growth (FCG) rate and path under {{variable}} amplitude <b>loading</b> (<b>VAL)</b> {{is a crucial}} issue in damage tolerant design commonly used in aerospace industry. The aim {{of the current study}} is to predict FCG life under VAL through Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) and to explicitly illustrate both FCG life and crack propagation. For this purpose an algorithm is developed and integrated in ABAQUS software to analyze 3 D crack propagation under VAL using Modified Generalized Willen-borg (MGW) retardation model. The results are compared with NASGRO crack propagation software and experimental FCG test data on 7075 -T 6 aluminum alloy under various over load (OL) and over load-under load (OL-UL) conditions which exhibit a good agreement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this {{investigation}} variation of cyclic loading effect on fatigue crack growth is the studied. This study is performed on 2024 T 351 and 7050 -T 74 aluminum alloys, used in aeronautical structures. The propagation model {{used in this}} study is NASGRO model. In constant amplitude loading (CA), effect of stress ratio has been investigated. Fatigue life and fatigue crack growth rate were affected by this factor. Results showed an increasing in fatigue crack growth rates (FCGRs) with increasing stress ratio. Variable amplitude <b>loading</b> (<b>VAL)</b> can take many forms i. e. with a single overload, overload band … etc. The shape of these loads affects strongly the fracture life and FCGRs. The application of a single overload (ORL) decrease the FCGR and increase the delay crack length caused by the formation of a larger plastic zone compared to the plastic zone due without VAL. The fatigue behavior of the both material under single overload has been compared. Keywords—Fatigue crack growth, overload ratio, stress ratio, generalized willenborg model, retardation, Al-alloys.

40|$|We {{present an}} optical sensing {{methodology}} {{to estimate the}} fatigue damage state of structures made of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), by measuring variations on the surface roughness. Variable amplitude <b>loads</b> (<b>VAL),</b> which represent realistic loads during aeronautical missions of fighter aircraft (FALSTAFF) have been applied to coupons until failure. Stiffness degradation and surface roughness variations have been measured during {{the life of the}} coupons obtaining a Pearson correlation of 0. 75 between both variables. The data were compared with a previous study for Constant Amplitude Load (CAL) obtaining similar results. Conclusions suggest that the surface roughness measured in strategic zones is a useful technique for structural health monitoring of CFRP structures, and that it is independent of the type of load applied. Surface roughness can be measured in the field by optical techniques such as speckle, confocal perfilometers and interferometry, among others...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} an optical non-contact technique {{to evaluate the}} fatigue damage state of CFRP structures measuring the irregularity factor of the surface. This factor includes information about surface topology and can be measured easily on field, by techniques such as optical perfilometers. The surface irregularity factor has been correlated with stiffness degradation, which is a well-accepted parameter {{for the evaluation of}} the fatigue damage state of composite materials. Constant amplitude fatigue loads (CAL) and realistic variable amplitude <b>loads</b> (<b>VAL),</b> representative of real in- flight conditions, have been applied to “dog bone” shaped tensile specimens. It has been shown that the measurement of the surface irregularity parameters can be applied to evaluate the damage state of a structure, and that it is independent of the type of fatigue load that has caused the damage. As a result, this measurement technique is applicable {{for a wide range of}} inspections of composite material structures, from pressurized tanks with constant amplitude loads, to variable amplitude loaded aeronautical structures such as wings and empennages, up to automotive and other industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|To the Editor: We thank Karagöz et al. {{for their}} letter [1] in {{response}} to our paper [2]. The letter is {{a good opportunity to}} pro-vide additional information on Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in drome-dary camels and their potential role in the transmission of MERS-CoV to humans. In fact, we mentioned in our paper [2] in detail that the cycle threshold (Ct) values in nasal and conjuncti-val swabs of the five MERS-CoV reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) positive Omani camels ranged from as low as 15. 74 to 36. 29, indicating a high viral load in the former.

40|$|In this paper, {{fatigue crack}} growth of edge crack in 2024 T 351 {{aluminum}} alloy plate repaired with bonded composite patch under constant and variable amplitude <b>loading</b> (<b>VAL)</b> was predicted. The Al-alloy plate was repaired with symmetric patch �Boron/Epoxy�. Additionally to {{constant amplitude loading}} (CAL), the effects of single overload and band overload were investigated for repaired and unrepaired Al-alloy plates. The obtained results confirm the improvement in repair performances by composite patch on fatigue lives and crack growth rates for all applied cycles (CAL and VAL) compared to unrepaired plates. A retardation effect was observed in application of single overload compared to band overload with the same stress ratio (R= 0. 2) for unpatched plate and characterized by instantaneous delays. However, this retardation effect is increased {{by the presence of}} the patch repair which leads to the higher fatigue life. Retardation effect was neglected for lower overload ratio (ORL> 1. 8). Comparison in fatigue life and crack growth rates under the same overload ratio (ORL= 2. 4) between repaired and unrepaired plates show the supplementary beneficial effects in combination of overloading and patch repai...|$|E
40|$|The {{actual service}} loading {{histories}} of most engineering components {{are characterized by}} variable amplitudes and are sometimes rather complicated. The goal {{of this study was}} to estimate the fatigue life of nickel-chromium-molybdenum 30 CrNiMo 8 HH steel alloy under axial and pure torsion variable amplitude <b>loading</b> (<b>VAL)</b> conditions. The investigation was directed at two primary factors that are believed to have an influence on fatigue life under such loading conditions: load sequence and mean stress. The experimental work for this research included two-step loading, non-zero mean strain loading, and VAL tests, the results of which were added to previously determined fully reversed strain-controlled fatigue data. The effect of load sequence on fatigue life was examined through the application of the commonly used linear damage accumulation rule along with the Manson and Marco–Starkey damage accumulation methods, the latter of which takes load sequence into account. Based on the two-step experimental results, both the Manson and Marco–Starkey methods were modified in order to eliminate the empirically determined constants normally required for these two methods. The effect of mean stress on fatigue life was investigated with the use of three life prediction models: Smith–Watson–Topper (SWT), Fatemi–Socie (FS), and Jahed–Varvani (JV). The cycles from the VAL histories were counted using a rainflow counting procedure that maintains the applied strain sequence, and a novel method was developed for the estimation of the total energy density required for the JV model. For two-step loading and for all three fatigue models employed, the modified damage accumulation methods provided superior fatigue life predictions. However, regardless of the damage accumulation method applied, the most satisfactory fatigue life correlation for VAL was obtained using the energy-based JV model...|$|E
40|$|Problem Little {{research}} {{has taken place}} to investigate fretting fatigue under conditions of variable amplitude <b>loading</b> (<b>VAL)</b> and no research using a complex loading spectra representative of reality. The effect of cycles below the endurance limit {{has yet to be}} established for fretting fatigue within such a spectrum. These cycles are of particular concern owing to the large number of these cycles present in comparison to other cycles within the spectrum. Any effects of VAL on local conditions within the contact had also yet to be established. Solution This project attacked the problem of fretting fatigue under conditions of VAL on two fronts. Firstly a vigorous VAL testing program (reconstructed from in-service data) was employed to investigate the effect of VAL on life and damage in general. The relative importance of cycles within the spectrum, particularly those below the endurance limit, with regards to life was investigated. Secondly to establish the effect of VAL within the contact region finite element modelling (FEM) was performed. Single and three level loading histories were applied to the model in order to establish the effect of VAL locally within the contact and offer explanations to the experimental observations. A series of damage prediction parameters including Ruiz and strain life initiation parameters were assessed for their ability to predict such behaviour. A methodology for predicting fretting fatigue life and damage has also been developed during this project. Two contact geometries were tested: a cylindrical Hertzian contact and the rounded punch contact. Conclusions Cycles of amplitude below the constant amplitude fretting fatigue endurance limit are nondamaging within a VAL spectrum. This was primarily attributed to the cycles below the endurance limit having a unique location of damage that other cycles do not influence. More sites of crack initiation were observed in samples that had experienced VAL than those tested under conditions of constant amplitude loading (CAL). The multiple sites of initiation were attributed to the point of maximum damage changing location during VAL. The size of the slip region of a cycle was found to decrease post overload as was the magnitude of Ruiz predicted damage. Strain life parameters also predicted a beneficial effect of an overload on the predicted lives of following CAL cycles. Miner predictions of life were conservative due to the assumptions made by the parameter. Miner sums damage over the entire contact region, essentially attributing that damage to a single location. Miner therefore {{does not take into account}} the changing location of maximum damage and the effects of load order and interaction. An alternative methodology for predicting fretting fatigue life during VAL has been presented that has been shown to be more accurate than traditional Miner and can account for unique features within the VAL spectrum e. g. training flights. Both Miner and the VAL methodology have shown that it is the small amplitude cycles within a spectrum that are the most damaging...|$|E
40|$|Early {{studies of}} genetic effects on brain {{activity}} {{have been conducted}} to investigate primarily either the influence of polymorphisms in dopaminergic genes, especially the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, on prefrontal cognitive processes such as working memory, or that of polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene on the amygdala response to threatening stimuli. Here, we address genetic influences on the neural systems underlying cognitive-affective interactions.

40|$|The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD EC 60 / 2000) {{requires}} that quality-flow compliance {{at a particular}} surface-water reach entail consideration of all upstream inputs, including contaminated land and groundwater contributions. Multivariate statistical techniques may improve {{our understanding of the}} pollutant sources affecting river quality. Aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the source apportionment and the groundwater contribution to the total pollutant load of Mella river. Factor Analysis (FA) was applied to a series of water quality measurements at seven monitoring sites, located upstream, in the middle and downstream the groundwater recharge area of the Mella river watershed. FA results in the upstream sites were completely different from the lowland stations that were strongly influenced by the groundwater contribution. In the upstream sites, in fact, the major pollutant source resulted to be the contribution of the Gobbia tributary which collects the industrial <b>loads</b> of the <b>Val</b> Trompia metallurgic consortium. On the other hand the groundwater was found to be the most significant pollutant source in the lowland sites. FA proved also useful to distinguish between sources of metals and chlorinated solvents...|$|R
