40|$|Abstract—Considerable {{work has}} been {{published}} to define the minimum possible antenna radiation {{as a function of}} the antenna size and gain. Many of the derivations assume an enclosing sphere and deal only with the fields external to this sphere. As a result, the limits tend to be overly optimistic, and realizable antennas generally have ’s considerably higher than the minimum values predicted by these theories. This paper defines stricter limits that apply to a class of antennas (or scatterers) consisting of any arrangement of conductors on a spherical surface. Energy stored within the sphere is included in the analysis. The minimum values are as much as three times the values based only on external fields. Recently published independent experimental data on electrically small antennas in this class reported values only slightly higher than the new limits provided in this paper.

40|$|A {{conventional}} periodic LC <b>ladder</b> <b>circuit</b> forms {{a transmission}} line {{that has a}} regular band edge between a pass and a stop band. Here {{for the first time}} we develop the theory of simple yet unconventional double <b>ladder</b> <b>circuit</b> that exhibits a special degeneracy condition referred to as degenerate band edge (DBE). The degeneracy occurs when four independent eigenstates coalesce into a single eigenstate at the DBE frequency. In addition to possible practical applications, this circuit may provide insight into DBE behavior that is not clear in more complex systems. We show that double ladder resonators exhibit unusual behavior of the loaded quality factor near the DBE leading to a stable resonance frequency against load variations. These two properties in the proposed circuit are superior to the analogous properties in single ladder circuits. Our proposed analysis leads to analytic expressions for all circuit quantities thus providing insight into the very complex behavior near degeneracy points in periodic circuits. Interestingly, here we show for the first time that DBE is obtained with unit cells that are symmetric along the propagation direction. The proposed theory of double ladders presented here has potential applications in filters, couplers, oscillators, and pulse shaping networks. Comment: 11 pages, 12 figure...|$|E

Every step on the resistor ladder has its own switch which can connect this step to the output terminal of the potentiometer.

The number of steps is normally indicated with a bit value e.g. 8 bits equals 256 steps; 8 bits is the most common, but resolutions between 5 and 10 bits (32 to 1024 steps) are available.

Some typical uses of digital potentiometers are in circuits requiring gain control of amplifiers (frequently instrumentation amplifiers), small-signal audio-balancing, and offset adjustment.|$|R
