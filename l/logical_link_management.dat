The location register of the SGSN stores location information (e.g., current cell, current VLR) and user profiles (e.g., IMSI, address(es) used in the packet data network) of all GPRS users registered with it.|$|E

30|$|The MR-MC {{solution}} {{has attracted}} {{a lot of attention}} with the benefits of interference reduction and network scalability improvement in wireless mesh networks. Nevertheless, the MR-MC model also poses technical issues to be dealt with [10]. As mentioned before, the number of available channels is limited to 3 or 12 within the IEEE 802.11 frequency bands. This implies that some <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> may be assigned the same channel. In this case, interference occurs if these <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> are close to each other, and hence the interfering links cannot be active simultaneously. Furthermore, the number of available NICs is also limited, and hence some <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> in a router need to share a NIC to transmit and receive the data packets. When two <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> in a router share a NIC, they are required to operate over the same frequency channel, and cannot be active simultaneously. Thus, it significantly reduces their effective capacity. The effective link capacity can be increased by removing some of the <b>links</b> from the <b>logical</b> topology. However, when some of the links are not activated, the number of hops through some routing paths may be increased, and the logical topology may not even be connected. Therefore, how many <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> should be assigned between neighboring routers, how to allocate interfaces and channels, and through which <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> should the packets be forwarded need to be considered in MR-MC WMNs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{multi-channel}} wireless {{mesh network}} (MC-WMN) {{consists of a}} number of stationary wireless routers, where each router is equipped with multiple network interface cards (NICs). Each interface operates on a distinct frequency channel. Two neighboring routers establish a <b>logical</b> <b>link</b> if each one has an interface operating on a common channel. Given the physical topology of the routers and other constraints, the logical topology formation algorithm determines the set of <b>logical</b> <b>links.</b> In general, since the number of NICs is limited, some <b>logical</b> <b>links</b> need to share an NIC in a router. The interface assignment algorithm determines the interface that a <b>logical</b> <b>link</b> should be attached to. In this paper, we formulate the logical topology design and interface assignment as a joint optimization problem to obtain an MC-WMN architecture, called TiMesh. We conducted extensive ns- 2 simulation experiments to evaluate our algorithm and compared it with another MC-WMN architecture called Hyacinth.
