50|$|Trituration, for instance, is {{comminution}} (or substance breakdown) by rubbing.

50|$|The {{striking}} black slip with {{a metallic}} sheen, so characteristic of Greek pottery, {{was a fine}} suspension (colloidal fraction) of an illitic clay with very low calcium oxide content which was rich in iron oxides and hydroxides, differentiating from that used for {{the body of the}} vase in terms of the calcium content, the exact mineral composition and the particle size. This clay suspension was most probably collected in situ from illitic clay beds and was then processed through <b>levigation.</b> To aid in the <b>levigation</b> step, {{it is likely that the}} Attic black slip was treated with deflocculants as indicated by trace levels of contaminants to the clay, such as Zn associated with vitriol. This clay suspension was thickened by concentration to a paste and was used for the decoration of the surface of the vase. The paint was applied on the areas intended to become black after firing.|$|E
50|$|When clay {{is first}} dug {{out of the}} ground it is full of rocks and shells and other useless items that need to be removed. To do this the potter mixes the clay with water and lets all the {{impurities}} sink to the bottom. This is called <b>levigation</b> or elutriation. This process can be done many times. The more times this is done, the smoother clay becomes.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Motor Speedway, track {{president}} Humpy Wheeler spent $250,000 {{to grind}} out bumps that were well-known at the track in {{a process known as}} <b>levigation.</b> The intent was to smooth out the surface and create more side-by-side racing. The results were dismal, as the smooth surface put excessive stress the tires, leading to premature failures. The race saw a then NASCAR-record 22 caution periods (16 were for spins or crashes, stemming from the tire issues). When the series returned in the fall for the UAW-GM Quality 500, additional <b>levigation</b> to the track was done in an effort to correct the problems, but it only made the issues worse. A total of 15 cautions flew during the race, 13 of which were blamed on the tires and the surface. It was believed that 42 of the 43 teams faced tire issues on the night. Eventual champion Tony Stewart said after the race that he'd [...] "have to renew my life insurance because I was afraid for my life out there" [...] and Kevin Harvick said that the race [...] "was the biggest embarrassment for this sport". Jimmie Johnson won both races.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, {{the surface}} of the track had begun to wear since its last {{repaving}} in 1994. This resulted in track officials diamond-grinding the track, a process known as <b>levigation,</b> to smooth out bumps that had developed. The ground surface caused considerable tire-wear problems in both of the NASCAR races that year. Both races saw a high number of accidents as a result of tire failure due to the roughness of the surface. In 2006, the track was completely repaved.|$|E
50|$|Methods of {{separation}} by specific gravity have a still wider application. The simplest {{of these is}} <b>levigation,</b> which is extensively employed in mechanical analysis of soils and treatment of ores, but is not so successful with rocks, as their components do not, as a rule, differ greatly in specific gravity. Fluids are used that do not attack most rock-forming minerals, but have a high specific gravity. Solutions of potassium mercuric iodide (sp. gr. 3.196), cadmium borotungstate (sp. gr. 3.30), methylene iodide (sp. gr. 3.32), bromoform (sp. gr. 2.86), or acetylene bromide (sp. gr. 3.00) are the principal fluids employed. They may be diluted (with water, benzene, etc.) or concentrated by evaporation.|$|E
5000|$|Smaller clay {{particles}} {{and a high}} calcium content lower the sintering point. The production of finely varied painting slips was achieved through <b>levigation</b> and the subsequent scooping off of various layer.The addition of [...] "peptising" [...] substances (i.e. substances that break up and separate the {{clay particles}} and prevent them from coagulating again) can further reduce particle size. Such substances include caustic soda (NaOH), ammonia (NH3), potash (K2CO3) and polyphosphates such as calgon (NaPO3)6: these attach themselves to the clay particles with strong hydrogen bonds and thus prevent them, {{in a similar way}} to tensides, from rejoining and coagulating again. In other words, the clay particles are now in a state of colloid suspension.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, {{the start}} was delayed by the finish to the Notre Dame-Southern California college {{football}} game which ran late. While {{the game was}} in its final minutes, NBC, the broadcaster of both events, had the race engines start and the pace laps proceed. As the pace car pulled off the track to pit road to start the race, NBC had just switched coverage from the game to the race, and the broadcast began as the field took the green flag. This race was known for the <b>levigation</b> disaster that made the track extremely fast causing the tires to blister and blow out after about 30 laps. It was due to this that Charlotte was repaved in early 2006 in time for their May events.|$|E
5000|$|The race, held on October 15 at Lowe's Motor Speedway {{was delayed}} by the finish of the Southern California-Notre Dame college {{football}} game which was being broadcast on NBC by forty-five minutes and ended after midnight (EDT) {{because of the}} green-white-checker finish rule. The race was marred by multiple tire problems, similar to the 2005 United States Grand Prix where tires seemed to [...] "self-destruct" [...] on their own. This {{was caused by a}} recent <b>levigation</b> of the track and Goodyear failing to bring an adequate tire to the track. Even with drivers driving at 75% speed, tires continued to explode due to excessive heat in the right-front tire. Not even series point leader and eventual champion Tony Stewart was exempt. At one point, NASCAR even considered calling the race, although they ended up throwing competition caution flags instead. When the smoke cleared, Jimmie Johnson won his fourth straight points-paying race at Lowe's and surged into a tie with Tony Stewart for the top of the standings. Stewart, who has five wins, holds the tie-breaker and retained the lead, finishing 25th. The top three finishers were involved in the 2005 Chase for the NEXTEL Cup.|$|E
5000|$|Clay {{is chosen}} {{largely based on}} culture. For many western potters the choice in clay is based on how soft it is to use.

After rainy periods, mesocosms collected leacheate was chemically analyzed {{in order to determine}} the amount of NO 3 -, NH 4 +, PO 43 -, K+. The outcomes have underlined the great leaching capacity of the nitrate (NO 3 -). The highest NO 3 - total amount recorded was of 1170 ppm while the smallest was of 641 ppm.

Numerous trace element compositions and ratios allow these visually similar products to be distinguished, and a Ding-style shard of uncertain origin is identified as a likely genuine Ding product. In Jiexiu kiln, Ding-style products have trace element features distinctive from blackwares of an inferior quality intended for the lower end market. Based on geochemical behaviour of these trace elements, we propose that geochemically distinctive raw materials were used for Ding-style products of a higher quality, which possibly also underwent purification by <b>levigation</b> prior to use. Capable of analysing over 40 elements with a typical long term precision of < 2 %, this high precision ICP-MS method proves to be very powerful for grouping and characterising archaeological ceramics.

The dump has been dated Augustan/ early Tiberian age (20 b. C. - 20 AD) and the thin walled vessels found can be identified with similar wares from Allifae, Cubulteria, Caiatia and perhaps Neapolis. Horace in his Sermones (II, 8, 39) cited the Allifana beakers (described as fictiles ac subtiles by a Horace scholiast) and they could possibly be identified with the thin walled wares produced in Allifae. If this the case, then the thin walled vessels produced in Allifae were known in Rome as early as the end of I century B. C. In order to investigate and characterise the Allifae thin-walled pottery, twenty-one samples were selected and mineralogical-petrographic analyses (OM, XRPD, XRF and SEM/EDS) were carried out.
