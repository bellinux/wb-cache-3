2500|$|The Golden Retriever was {{originally}} bred in Scotland in the mid-19th century. At that time, wildfowl hunting {{was a popular}} sport for the wealthy Scottish elite, but the existing retriever breeds were inadequate for retrieving downed game from both water and land. Retrieving from both land and water was necessary because the hunting grounds of the time were pocketed with marshy ponds and rivers. Consequently, the best water spaniels were crossed with the existing retrievers, resulting {{in the establishment of}} the breed today known as the Golden Retriever. The Golden Retriever was first developed near Glen Affric in Scotland, at [...] "Guisachan", the highland estate of Dudley Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth. For many years, what breeds were originally crossed was disputed, but in 1952, the publication of Marjoribanks' breeding records from 1835 to 1890 dispelled the myth concerning the purchase of a whole troupe of Russian tracker sheepdogs from a visiting circus, instead it details a careful <b>line-breeding</b> program. Commonly, the breed is said to have originated from the Russian tracker.|$|E

50|$|One {{contemporary}} recreation of {{the breed}} {{started in the}} 1970s, using a breeding program developed for cattle at The Ohio State University. The lineage has since split into two, known as the Olde English Bulldogge and the Leavitt Bulldog, the Leavitt Bulldog being a lighter, more athletic dog. These modern day versions, though possessing similar physical abilities, {{do not have the}} violent temperament of the Old English Bulldog. The <b>line-breeding</b> was done with a foundation of half Bulldog, and the other half Bullmastiff and American Bulldog.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{relation}} between the prevalence of canine hip dysplasia, inbreeding and genetic diversity by breed. Methods: Retrospective pedigree analysis of 9 breeds based on a reference population of 41, 728 individuals, and hip dysplasia assessment in 1745 dogs. Results: Hip dysplasia was less common among breeds with higher coefficient of inbreeding, lower genetic diversity, and highest contribution of one single ancestor to the population. Inbreeding not exceeding 3. 25 % should be considered safe since it will maintain a sufficiently high genetic diversity within the breed. Clinical Significance: Together with published data on single breeds, the present findings question the general assumption that <b>line-breeding</b> or in-breeding has an adverse effect on the prevalence of hip dysplasia. Hip assessment is indicated in all breeds, but better methods are needed for selecting dogs suitable for reproduction...|$|E
