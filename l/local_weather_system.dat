5000|$|The Aegean Rally is an {{international}} sailing regatta held in Greece. Held annually since 1964, it is organised by the Hellenic Offshore Racing Club. The regatta is broken up into three to six individual competitions, with the course taking {{in several of the}} Aegean Islands after a start in Faleron Bay. The event is strongly affected by the meltemi, the brisk local north-easterly wind which blows from dawn to dusk at between fifteen to twenty-five knots, driven by a <b>local</b> <b>weather</b> <b>system</b> & documented since ancient times.For the 2009 race, qualified boats included ORC International, ORC Club, IRC 1 (endorsed, TCC≥0,980) and IRC 2 (any IRC boat) measured boats with LOA greater than 7.00 m and with current valid rating certificate. Classic yachts and traditional boats are eligible to enter the event’s first race.|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} of the atmosphere endows it with the property of turbulence by virtue of which, wind speed variations in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) exhibit highly irregular fluctuations that persist {{over a wide range}} of temporal and spatial scales. Despite the large and significant body of work on microscale turbulence, understanding the statistics of atmospheric wind speed variations has proved to be elusive and challenging. Knowledge about the nature of wind speed at ABL has far reaching impact on several fields of research such as meteorology, hydrology, agriculture, pollutant dispersion, and more importantly wind energy generation. In the present study, temporal wind speed records from twenty eight stations distributed through out the state of North Dakota (ND, USA), (∼ 70, 000 square-miles) and spanning a period of nearly eight years are analyzed. We show that these records exhibit a characteristic broad multifractal spectrum irrespective of the geographical location and topography. The rapid progression of air masses with distinct qualitative characteristics originating from Polar regions, Gulf of Mexico and Northern Pacific account for irregular changes in the <b>local</b> <b>weather</b> <b>system</b> in ND. We hypothesize that one of the primary reasons for the observed multifractal structure could be the irregular recurrence and confluence of these three air masses...|$|E

50|$|The SPICE project {{investigated}} {{whether or}} not these natural processes can be mimicked and, if so, with what effect. It {{was one of the first}} UK projects aimed at providing evidence-based knowledge about geoengineering technologies. The project itself did not carrying out geoengineering, but it investigated the feasibility of doing so. SPICE sought to shed lighton some of the uncertainties surrounding this controversial subject, and encourage debate to help inform any futureresearch and decision-making. Geoengineering is seen as being potentially useful in combating climate change but could also lead to unforeseen or unintended risks - for example on <b>local</b> <b>weather</b> <b>systems,</b> or discouraging people to take action to reduce carbonemissions.|$|R

40|$|Since a cold surge is a {{hazardous}} weather phenomenon in east Asia, the rapid population increase {{and economic growth}} {{over the past two}} decades require improvement in forecasting cold surges and their related weather events over this region. However, without a better understanding of these events, this task cannot be accomplished. A cold surge with a well-defined cold front passing through Taiwan was selected to illustrate its impact on the east Asian <b>weather</b> <b>system.</b> This case is typical of a large portion of surges occuring in the region. Major findings of this study are as follows. Coupling with the upper ridge-trough structures of the wave train straddling the eastern seaboard of northeast Asia, cold surges occur sequentially. A cold front with a prefront high pressure zone is formed by the new surge outflow interacting with the anticyclone of the aging surge. The warm moist air advected northeastward along the cold front assists the development of the new surge 2 ̆ 7 s low center, while the prefront high pressure zone facilitates the formation of a double-cell structure in the local Hadley circulation. The southeastward propagation of the cold front is driven by the eastward-propagating short-wave trough through the couplets of both new and aging cold surges. The surface weather conditions in the low-elevation zones of Taiwan are modulated by the cold surge flow, but the high-elevation areas may be affected instead by the tropical southeast Asian high. Despite the success of the prior and post-WMONEX (Winter Monsoon Experiment) research in exploring the tropical-midlatitude interaction, the close interaction of cold surges with <b>local</b> <b>weather</b> <b>systems</b> and the planetary-scale circulation in east Asia, illustrated by the case study presented, provides another dimension of cold surge research...|$|R
40|$|In a {{world with}} an ever {{increasing}} population, the demand for energy is constantly on the rise. Most countries also agree, that a sustainable development should be ensured. To accomplish this, a higher penetration of renewables in the present energy system is needed. Unlike traditional power production like thermal and hydro power plants, many of the renewable energy production units can not produce electricity at the desired frequency without power electronic devices. HVDC grids have also been suggested, {{as a mean to}} electrically connect geographically distant areas, to reduce the problem of <b>local</b> <b>weather</b> <b>systems</b> influencing the output of many renewable sources. It should thus be quite evident, that good models of power electronic devices are needed, to analyse the system's behaviour, and in particular its stability. In this report a black-box measurement based modelling technique will be investigated, with its biggest advantage being, that no a priori knowledge of the device under investigation is needed. The thesis starts off with an introduction to the relevant theory, and an introduction to the methodology. In the theory part a suggestion for a new equation set to calculate the model and a stability criterion for the model is presented. The new equation set for calculating the model is also proven to be equivalent with the old one. In the rest of the thesis the focus is on developing a test bench for obtaining the model. Following a step by step approach, starting with simulations on a VSI developed in Simulink, to get acquainted with the methodology. Before a test bench was developed for testing the methodology on dc-dc converters, ultimately leading to tests conducted on a physical VSI. </p...|$|R

The speed and diversity of media through which we now communicate 2 ̆ 2 the weather 2 ̆ 2 significantly impact how U.

This project explores four weather emergencies, covering physical geographies of the far northwest, Great Plains, mid-Atlantic, and Caribbean, that were circulated and reframed via a range of media [...] from newspapers to television, social, and new media [...] who discussed these events, and to what ends.
