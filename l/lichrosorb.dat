40|$|Analysis of {{macrolides}} and tetracyclines {{in hospital}} wastewaters by HPLC ABSTRACT Macrolide and tetracycline antibiotics are drugs used for treatment {{and prevention of}} infectional illnesses both in human and veterinary medicine. As other environmental contaminats, they can accumulate in environment and induce adverse effects in terrestrial and aquatic organisms. and induce bacterial resistance. The sensitive analytical methods are necessary to quantify their level in wastewaters to rate the risk caused by their presence in environment. The HPLC with MS detection is method mostly used to analysis, because of its high sensitivity. A method using UV or fluorescence detection was tried to be developed {{as an alternative to}} HPLC-MS. A method to analyse macrolide using Hichrom <b>Lichrosorb</b> RP 18, 250 x 4. 6 mm i. d. and Chromolith Performance column RP 18 e, 100 x 4. 6 mm i. d. were used. A mobile phase ACN: 0. 05 M KH 2 PO 4 (pH 7. 5) 30 : 70 (v/v) was used, the detector was set at 215 nm. The method using pre-column derivatization by FMOC-Cl was studied. The analysis was performed on Chromolith Performance column RP 18 e, 100 x 4. 6 mm i. d. The fluorescence detector was set at excitation wavelength 255 nm and emission wavelength 315 nm. The method to analyse tetracyclines used gradient elution of ACN and 0. 02 M oxalic acid [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|An {{accurate}} and sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatograph-ic method for determination of sertraline in human serum is described using 4 -chloro- 7 -nitrobenzofurazan as pre-column derivatization agent. The drug and an internal standard (azithrimycin) were extracted from serum using {{a mixture of}} diethyl ether-chloroform and subjected to the pre-column derivatization with the reagent. Analysis of the resulted derivatives was performed on a <b>Lichrosorb</b> CN (250 × 4. 0 mm) column using a mobile phase composed of methanol and sodium phosphate buffer (0. 05 M; pH 3. 7) containing 2 ml/lit triethylamine (63 : 37 v/v). Detector response was monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 470 and 537 nm, respectively. The calibration curve was linear over the concentration range of 2 to 640 ng/ml. The lower limits of detection and quantification were 0. 5 and 2 ng/ml, respectively. The validation of the analysis {{was carried out in}} terms of specificity, sensitivity, linearity, precision, accuracy and stability. The validated method was shown to be accurate, with intra-day and inter-day accuracy from 0. 3 to 4. 2 % and precise, with intra-day and inter-day precision from 2. 4 to 15. 5 %. The drug is detected at concentrations as low as 2 ng/ml in a 0. 5 ml serum sample and the described method can be easily applied in human single-dose pharmacokinetic studies of sertraline...|$|E

Four well known monomers (+) -Catechin, (-) -Epicatechin, (+) -Gallocatechin, (-) -Epigallocatechin. Other compounds Quercetin, Kaempferol, Fisetin and Gallic acid These compounds were characterised by chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques, including by thiolytic degradation with toluene-a-thiol and using acetylated and methyl derivatives. Structural elucidation of the cleavage products was by ‘H-NMR. The backbone of the isolated compounds consisted mainly of a mixture of flavan- 3 -ol units with 2 R- configuration. The purity of monomers, dimers and trimer was checked by HPLC on <b>Lichrosorb</b> RP 8 column. The molecular weight distribution ranges between 250 and 5500 and the average molecular weight distribution {{was found to be}} 1550 by gel permeation chromatography. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy demonstrated the complex nature of NBT molecular masses consist of monomeric, dimeric and trimeric units of procyanidin B and C types respectively. IR and FT-IR spectroscopy results were consistent {{with the rest of the}} techniques used.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{model to}} study synthesis of cholesterol and pregnenolone from the precursor mevalonolactone (MVA) {{was developed in}} C 6 - 2 B glioma cells. The steroidogenic capability of this cell line and the regulation of pregnenolone production by 4 '-chlorodiazepam (4 'CD), a specific ligand for the mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) receptor (MDR), were investigated. Cells maintained in serum-free media were incubated with lovastatin (20 microM) and two inhibitors of pregnenolone metabolism, trilostane (25 microM) and 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro- 4 -oxo- 7 -chloro- 2 -naphthylpyridine (10 microM). Under these conditions the incorporation of [3 H]MVA into cholesterol and pregnenolone formation was biphasic, with an initial rapid phase (within 1 min) followed by a slower phase. Cholesterol and pregnenolone were identified by coelution with authentic steroids from a Si 60 <b>Lichrosorb</b> column and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Pregnenolone synthesis in intact C 6 - 2 B glioma cells was stimulated by nanomolar concentrations of 4 'CD after 5 min of incubation with MVA. The stimulatory effect was dependent on drug concentration and the maximal effect was achieved at 10 nM. The time course showed that the incorporation of MVA into pregnenolone is accelerated by the MDR ligand. Cholesterol synthesis is only slightly and not significantly affected by 4 'CD. These results {{support the view that}} steroid synthesis occurs in a glioma cell line. Moreover, we provide evidence for a rapid steroid synthesis in C 6 - 2 B glioma cells, which in turn appears to be accelerated by 1 - 100 nM 4 'CD, a MDR ligand...|$|E
