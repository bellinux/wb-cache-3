5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, American <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> had reports of Noriega's {{possible}} involvement with narcotics trafficking. No formal criminal investigations were begun, however, with news reports attributing {{the lack of}} action to factors including U.S. interest in concluding the Panama Canal treaty, the value of intelligence from Panama, and Panama's support for U.S. foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|After their arrest, <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> {{investigated}} whether Adolf, Gartrell and Johnson {{were linked}} to vandalism shootings that targeted at least two federal buildings in Denver two weeks prior to their arrest. Windows were shot at the U.S. Custom House and the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Station in Denver's downtown Federal District. Authorities were also studying whether a bullet recovered from a Hertz rental car shot on August 15 could have matched the guns seized from the men.|$|E

5|$|Judge Appleby {{eventually}} cut off {{funds for}} any further expert defense testimony. Shakur, in her autobiography, and Williams, in Inadmissible Evidence, both {{claim that it}} was difficult to find expert witnesses for the trial, because of the expense and because most forensic and ballistic specialists declined on the grounds of a conflict of interest when approached because they routinely performed such work for <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stone recovered, and was {{released}} from UCDMC on October 15, a week after he was stabbed. Sacramento Police detectives {{were assigned to the}} case shortly after the initial stabbing. Along with video obtained of the assault; eyewitness statements; and tips from the public, detectives determined the identity of the assailant, and an arrest warrant was issued for Tran. On November 4th, 2015, Tran was arrested without incident, after detectives, uniformed officers, and deputies from the Sacramento Police Department, Elk Grove Police Department, and Sacramento County Sheriff's Department conducted a traffic stop near his home in Elk Grove, California. <b>Law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> involved in the case said that it did not appear Tran or anyone in his group knew of Stone's publicity. Officials also stated that the crime {{did not appear to be}} a retaliatory strike by a terrorist organization (either directly or indirectly) against Stone for his part in foiling a terror attack. <b>Law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> stated that Tran has previous felony convictions, and that Tran was most likely intoxicated at the time of the assault.|$|E

5|$|<b>Law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> {{questioned}} about 500 people across several Texas cities, including known sex offenders and Garza's family members, co-workers and ex-boyfriends. They carried out almost 50 polygraph examinations, and they offered a $2,500 reward {{for information about}} her death, which was larger than any amount of money previously offered in a Rio Grande Valley murder case. South Texas businessmen later posted $10,000 of reward money. The priest who heard Garza's last confession, Father John Feit, came under suspicion soon after her disappearance. The 27-year-old priest {{had been at the}} church since completing seminary training in San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Daley and all <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> who {{had been}} deposed were {{excluded}} from the report. Also, the 75 credible abuse cases were overlooked; the report focused on doubts about the torture of the four pardoned death row inmates. Among the final costs were $6.2 million for the investigation and $7 million to hire outside counsel for Burge and his cohort. Many activists were disappointed to learn that the statute of limitations meant that Burge would not be prosecuted for torture. Debates in the op-ed pages continued for days. Egan explained his report to the public with legal theories and federal jurisdiction issues.|$|E

Citizens of Versailles were more outraged that the jailer had been removed from office than that the prisoner had been lynched. The locals refused to aid in the investigation, and the lynchers were never arrested or charged. Local officials appointed the jailer's wife to finish his term in an attempt to skirt the removal.|$|E
