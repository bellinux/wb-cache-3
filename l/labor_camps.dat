5|$|The ghetto was {{liquidated}} between 22 and 24 September 1943. Three thousand {{six hundred}} residents went to <b>labor</b> <b>camps</b> (including 2,000 sent to <b>labor</b> <b>camps</b> in Vilnius); 5,000 {{women and children}} went to Majdanek, where they were gassed to death; and a few hundred elderly and sick were sent to Ponary and shot. The few Jews who remained in Vilnius were shot just before the Soviet Army arrived. A few FPO members escaped to the nearby forests.|$|E
5|$|Gens {{was shot}} by the Gestapo on 14 September 1943, shortly before the ghetto was {{liquidated}} {{and most of the}} residents sent either to <b>labor</b> <b>camps</b> or to execution at an extermination camp. His Lithuanian wife and daughter escaped the Gestapo and survived the war.|$|E

(And the Wind Returns...) by Vladimir Bukovsky, {{describing}} the dissident movement, their struggle or freedom, practices {{of dealing with}} dissenters, and dozen years spent by Bukovsky in Soviet <b>labor</b> <b>camps,</b> prisons and psychiatric hospitals, was published and later translated into English under the title To Build a Castle: My Life as a Dissenter.|$|E
5|$|As Jolie {{preferred}} to dedicate {{herself to her}} humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child <b>labor</b> <b>camps</b> served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed {{for the use of}} an exclusively Khmer cast and script. Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney's sequel.|$|E
50|$|During the Stalinism era Urvantsev {{was several}} times wrongfully accused of wrecking. He {{was convicted and}} had to serve in Karlag (Karaganda <b>labor</b> <b>camp</b> system) and Norillag (Norilsk <b>labor</b> <b>camp</b> system).|$|R

5|$|At its peak, {{the camp}} held 8,000American {{soldiers}} (along {{with a small}} number of soldiers and civilians from other nations including the United Kingdom, Norway, and the Netherlands), making it the largest POW camp in the Philippines. This number dropped significantly as able-bodied soldiers were shipped to other areas in the Philippines, Japan, Japanese-occupied Taiwan, and Manchukuo to work in slave <b>labor</b> <b>camps.</b> As Japan had not yet ratified the Geneva Convention, the POWs were transported out of the camp and forced to work in factories to build Japanese weaponry, unload ships, and repair airfields.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1955, {{thousands}} of political prisoners had returned home, and told their experiences of the gulag <b>labor</b> <b>camps.</b> Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors. Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people. Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming 20th Party Congress about Stalin's crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure, and managed {{to persuade him to}} make his remarks in a closed session.|$|E
5|$|Finkelstein {{has written}} of his Jewish parents' {{experiences}} during World War II. His mother, Maryla Husyt, {{grew up in}} Warsaw, survived the Warsaw Ghetto, the Majdanek concentration camp, and two slave <b>labor</b> <b>camps.</b> Her first husband died in the war. She considered {{the day of her}} liberation as the most horrible day of her life, as she realized that she was alone, her parents and siblings gone. Norman's father, Zacharias Finkelstein, active in Hashomer Hatzair, was a survivor of both the Warsaw Ghetto and the Auschwitz concentration camp.|$|E
50|$|The Northwestern Youth <b>Labor</b> <b>Camp</b> was a Chinese <b>labor</b> <b>camp</b> for {{politically}} suspect youth established {{during the}} Chinese Civil War {{by order of}} Kuomintang Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek on 1 February 1940. Administered by military training units under General Jiang Jianren, the <b>labor</b> <b>camp</b> held young activists and students accused of supporting the Chinese Communist Party, including more than 300 students from high schools and colleges. They were subjected to biweekly indoctrination in anti-communist ideology.|$|R
50|$|The Jewish {{community}} organizers {{were taken}} to the Soviet Union, where Kaufman was imprisoned in a Gulag <b>labor</b> <b>camp</b> for 11 years. Zimin would die during his imprisonment in the Soviet penal <b>labor</b> <b>camp</b> that he was interned in.|$|R

5|$|In {{their first}} strike against the Trade Federation, Kael, Sykes, Ved, Lutin Hollis and Kol Kotha, a {{mercenary}} agent of Borvo's, destroy the communications satellite Comm 4. The satellite's destruction temporarily disables a Federation {{base on the}} planet, allowing the resistance to successfully attack it and destroy numerous droids and heavy equipment. During the fight, Sykes commandeers a Federation gunboat and uses it to liberate <b>labor</b> <b>camps</b> along the Andrevea River, escorting the freed prisoners to a rendezvous point among ruins to the north.|$|E
5|$|When Falun Gong {{was banned}} in {{mainland}} China in 1999, re-education through labor became a common punishment for practitioners. Some {{human rights groups}} claim {{that as many as}} 10,000 Falun Gong members were detained in between 1999 and 2002, with as many as 5,000 detained in 2001 alone. More recent estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong adherents are imprisoned in China, with some sources estimating up to half of the official reeducation through labor camp population is Falun Gong practitioners. In some <b>labor</b> <b>camps,</b> Falun Gong practitioners make up the majority population.|$|E
5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in July 1940, Gens was fired from his job. He was unable to secure a work permit nor was he allowed to continue to live in Kaunas. He went to live with his brother, Solomon, in Vilnius, and although Gens was on a list to be sent to Soviet <b>labor</b> <b>camps,</b> he managed to secure an unregistered job at the Vilnius health department through an old military colleague, Colonel Juozas Ūsas. Gens was not on the official payroll, which meant that the political officer attached to the hospital {{did not need to be}} informed of his employment. During June 1941, when thousands of the Lithuanian elites were exiled to Siberia, Gens remained in hiding and was not deported.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} of the Banat-Swabians, the German-speaking minority in Romania, is a recurring theme in Müller's writing. Historically, Germans were recruited by the Austria-Hungary to repopulate southern areas following the expulsion of the Turks of the Ottoman Empire. They were given special privileges, allowed to keep their language and Roman Catholicism, even in areas in which the Orthodox Church was paramount. Their communities spoke German into the 20th century. They were among ethnic Germans, or Volksdeutsche, whom Adolph Hitler proposed to unite in a greater Germany. Millions of ethnic Germans were expelled from eastern Europe after the war; thousands were forced into <b>labor</b> <b>camps.</b> Even years later, they were often discriminated against in Romania under the communist government.|$|E
5|$|The women's {{movement}} {{during the}} Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), like other movements in this period, came {{to depend on}} the cult of Mao Zedong. During the Cultural Revolution, the women’s movement was viewed as bourgeois and reactionary since it had originated in the West. The ACWF shutdown in 1968 because it was considered anti-revolutionary. The party argued that the women’s movement needed to be completely immersed in the revolutionary movement instead of harboring its own agenda. The offices of the ACWF were occupied by the army and many of the female cadres who had been involved with the women’s movement were sent to <b>labor</b> <b>camps</b> in the countryside. Women’s work ceased to function until the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Lured by {{numerous}} incentives {{such as food}} coupons, better housing and other benefits, they were received coldly by the Armenians living in the Republic upon their arrival. The repatriates spoke the Western Armenian dialect, instead of the Eastern Armenian spoken in Soviet Armenia. They were often addressed as aghbars ("brothers") by Armenians living in the republic, due to their different pronunciation of the word. Although initially used in humor, the word went on {{to carry on a}} more pejorative connotation. Their treatment by the Soviet government was not much better. A number of Armenian immigrants in 1946 had their belongings confiscated upon arrival at Odessa's port, as they had taken with them everything they had, including clothes and jewelry. This was the first disappointment experienced by Armenians; however, as there was no possibility of return the Armenians were forced to continue their journey to Armenia. Many of the immigrants were targeted by Soviet intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Interior for real or perceived ties to Armenian nationalist organizations, and were later sent to <b>labor</b> <b>camps</b> in Siberia and elsewhere, where they would not be released until after Stalin's death.|$|E

50|$|Jean Pasqualini's {{account of}} life in the <b>labor</b> <b>camp</b> system was a major source for The Black Book of Communism.

5|$|In late 1942, the Germans {{consolidated}} {{some small}} ghettos in the Vilnius region with Gens' help. These included the ghettos at Oszmiana, Švenčionys, Soly, and Michaliszki. During {{one of these}} consolidations, on 25 October, Gens gave up 400 old people in return for saving the remaining 600 Jewish residents of Oszmiana. He bribed Martin Weiss, commander of the Ponary killing squad, to accept the lower quota. The Jewish police from Vilnius {{as well as some}} Lithuanians were forced to kill the 400 Jews. One ghetto diarist claimed that the Vilnius ghetto was outraged by Gens' participation in the killings, but other diarists stated that most ghetto inhabitants approved of Gens' choice to save some. By April 1943, most of these small ghettos were gone, with their inhabitants either moved to <b>labor</b> <b>camps,</b> shot, or moved to the Vilnius Ghetto. On 4–5 April, the last inhabitants were loaded into trains {{under the supervision of the}} Vilnius Jewish police, and the police accompanied the trains, which passed through Vilnius on their way to Ponary. Gens joined his policemen when the train went through Vilnius, and was arrested along with them when the train arrived at Ponary. Gens and the policemen were released, but the other Jews on the train were executed. It appears that the Germans misled Gens about the destination of the trains. Gens justified the participation of the Vilnius ghetto police in these roundups by claiming that their participation saved at least some of the ghetto residents, when otherwise the Germans would have shot them all.|$|E
