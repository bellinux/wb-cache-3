Hoffman was signed to a one-year, $6 million contract for the Brewers. Relievers Todd Coffey, who was signed to a one-year contract avoiding arbitration after being claimed off waivers in September, and free agent Jorge Julio rounded out the offseason bullpen acquisitions.|$|E

5000|$|An {{overlock}} {{is a kind}} of stitch that sews {{over the}} edge of one or two pieces of cloth for edging, hemming, or seaming. Usually an overlock sewing machine will cut the edges of the cloth as they are fed through (such machines being called [...] "sergers" [...] in North America), though some are made without cutters. The inclusion of automated cutters allows overlock machines to create finished seams easily and quickly. An overlock sewing machine differs from a lockstitch sewing machine in that it uses <b>loopers</b> fed by multiple thread cones rather than a bobbin. <b>Loopers</b> serve to create thread loops that pass from the needle thread to the edges of the fabric so that the edges of the fabric are contained within the seam.|$|R
