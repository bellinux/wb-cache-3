60|$|I {{never saw}} Robert so enraged about a criticism. He is better now, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add</b> a {{few words}} more and then bring this story of life in camp to a conclusion.|$|E
60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add</b> here, regretfully {{but with}} {{infinite}} respect, {{one other thing}} about Parker, and then she shall drop into her proper place.|$|E
60|$|And before I do {{conclude}} this, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> also <b>add</b> {{one word}} more; to wit, to exhort {{them to look}} that they may see that which God at present may be doing among the Babylonians.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And <b>let</b> <b>me</b> congratulate you,' <b>added</b> the governor, {{shaking hands}} with him; 'and add, that all I have known of you has been as {{complete}} an exculpation as any discovery can be.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Edith!" [...] was his {{internal}} oath, [...] "never will I add a thorn to thy pillow. That which Heaven has ordained, let it be; and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> not <b>add,</b> by my selfish sorrows, one atom's {{weight to}} the burden thou hast to bear. I was dead to thee when thy resolution was adopted; and never, never shalt thou know that Henry Morton still lives!" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add</b> a {{few words}} more and then bring to a close this story of two young soldiers' adventures while [...] "Marching on Niagara." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a mouthful. And, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add,</b> I {{consider}} {{these young men}} gentlemen, and I won't have them annoyed while they are in my place." ...|$|E
60|$|Before I leave <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add</b> {{my thanks}} to those of Mr. Clayton for the {{kindness}} you have shown in permitting us the use of your cabin.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear girl, {{we shall}} have you sick in your bed, unless you keep {{yourself}} warm and quiet for a few days. Widow Wadman {{can take care of}} the ward alone, now the men are so comfortable, and have her vacation when you are about again. Now do be prudent in time, and don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have to <b>add</b> a Periwinkle to my bouquet of patients." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{is true that}} Mr. Darwin has not, in so many words, applied {{his views}} to ethnology; but even he who [...] "runs and reads" [...] the [...] "Origin of Species" [...] can hardly fail to do so; and, furthermore, Mr. Wallace and M. Pouchet have {{recently}} treated of ethnological questions {{from this point of}} view. <b>Let</b> <b>me,</b> in conclusion, <b>add</b> my own contribution to the same store.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> {{hasten to}} <b>add</b> that the protest of Propriety was duly entered, {{on the day}} before my promised husband arrived. Standing in the doorway--nothing would induce her to take a chair, or even to enter the room--Miss Jillgall {{delivered}} her opinion on Philip's approaching visit. Mrs. Tenbruggen reported it in her pocket-book, as if she was representing a newspaper at a public meeting. Here it is, copied from her notes: ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add</b> a {{few words}} more and then bring to a close this story of pioneer life, and of adventures while [...] "On the Trail of Pontiac." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add</b> a {{few words}} more and then bring to a close this tale of the naval and {{military}} adventures [...] "At the Fall of Port Arthur." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aw--just so," [...] {{said the}} {{sporting}} Englishman. [...] "And <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add,</b> {{as a sort}} of--aw--freelance that I and my friend here hope sincerely that you will choose to fight." ...|$|E
40|$|Gondwanan Heritage is {{dedicated}} to two inspirational Western Australian biologists, Bert Main and Sid James. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> therefore <b>add</b> my appreciation for the efforts of Bert Main and Sid James. Bert is probably most revered for his wit and commitment to scientifically based environmental management and conservation. His research on evolutionary ecology {{is that of a}} true naturalist with publications on plants, fish, invertebrates, reptiles, fire ecology, biodiversity, and the history of science to mention just a few of his interests. Sid James is a plant evolutionist and geneticist and, as Steve Hopper puts it, his work provides "compelling reasons for conserving all that remains of Western Australia's remnant vegetation"...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see you are unconvinced, citizen Martin-Roget," [...] he said quietly, [...] "and I {{know that}} it is the fashion {{nowadays}} among young politicians to sneer at Chauvelin--the living embodiment of failure. But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> just <b>add</b> this. When you and I talked matters over together at the Bottom Inn, in the wilds of Somersetshire, I warned you that not only was your identity known to the man who calls himself the Scarlet Pimpernel, but also that he knew every one of your plans with regard to the Kernogan wench and her father. You laughed at me then ... do you remember?... you shrugged your shoulders and jeered at what you call my far-fetched ideas ... just as you do now. Well! will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> remind you of what happened within four-and-twenty hours of that warning which you chose to disregard? ... Yvonne de Kernogan was married to Lord Anthony Dewhurst and...." ...|$|R
50|$|The cover {{notes on}} this edition were written by John Hammond, October 5, 1972.Among other things he {{mentions}} that all the sides on the record were originally made as singles, primarily for the jukebox market. At the end he writes: For some strange reason, this album has always {{been something of a}} secret, and I can only hope that it gets across to a new generation of Aretha admirers. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> hasten to <b>add</b> that there has been no overdubbing, rechanneling or other messing around with the pure gold of the original.|$|R
60|$|The Elephant was my wife's; {{so she is}} proportionately elate {{you should}} have picked it out for praise--from a collection, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add,</b> so replete with the highest qualities of art.|$|E
6000|$|... "Morris," [...] {{interrupted}} Michael, [...] "I do {{wish you}} would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add</b> one point, for I think it will affect your judgment. It's pathetic too--since that's your taste in literature." ...|$|E
60|$|May. 'Tis rightly judged: And, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add,</b> {{who heads}} a popular cause, Must prosecute that cause by popular ways: So, whether you are merciful or no, You must affect to be.|$|E
60|$|Now, dearest Fanny, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> {{confess to}} you. I have not brought the bonnet. A bonnet is a {{personal}} matter, and I would not let anyone choose one for me. Still, as you had more faith in man (or woman), I would have risked even displeasing you, only Robert would not <b>let</b> <b>me.</b> He said it was absurd--I 'did not know your size;' I 'could not know your taste;' in fact, he would not <b>let</b> <b>me.</b> Perhaps after all it is better. You shall see mine, which is the last novelty, and I {{will tell you the}} results of having investigated the bonnet question generally. I was told at a fashionable shop that hats might be worn out of one's teens; but in Paris, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> hasten to <b>add,</b> you don't see hats walking about except on the heads of small girls. In Rome it may be otherwise, as at the seaside it was. Bonnets are a great deal larger, but you shall see.|$|R
60|$|I might {{write more}} {{particularly}} on this topic; but I am unwilling {{to run the}} risk of saying more on the subject of these good deeds than the good-doer himself would sanction. And besides, I must remember that the object of this narrative is to record a holiday-cruise, and not to enter into details on the subject of Scilly; details which have already been put into print by previous travellers. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> only <b>add</b> then, that our sojourn in the islands terminated with the close of our stay in the house of our kind entertainer. It had been blowing a gale of wind for two days before our departure; and we put to sea with a doubled-reefed mainsail, and with more doubts than we liked to confess to each other, about the prospects of the return voyage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Something {{very much}} {{to the purpose of}} course. He begins with {{congratulations}} on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> now <b>add</b> a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to {{as one of the most}} illustrious personages in this land.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mar. Yet {{this strange}} disproportion in your years, [...] And, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add,</b> {{disparity}} of tempers, [...] Might {{make the world}} doubt whether such an union [...] Could make you wisely, permanently happy.|$|E
60|$|The Elephant was my wife's; {{so she is}} proportionately elate {{you should}} have picked it out for praise - from a collection, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add,</b> so replete with the highest qualities of art.|$|E
60|$|Having {{come to this}} {{resolution}} (and deriving, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add,</b> parenthetically, great consolation from it), the next subject of consideration was the best method of getting safely into the top regions of the house.|$|E
60|$|This {{excellent}} Person, one of {{my earliest}} and dearest friends, died in the year 1835. We were under-graduates together of the same year, at the same college, and companions in many a delightful ramble through his own romantic country of North Wales. Much of {{the latter part of}} his life he passed in comparative solitude; which I know was often cheered by remembrance of our youthful adventures, and of the beautiful regions which, at home and abroad, we had visited together. Our long friendship was never subject to a moment's interruption,--and, while revising these volumes for the last time, I have been so often reminded of my loss, with a not unpleasing sadness, that I trust the Reader will excuse this passing mention of a Man who well deserves from me something more than so brief a notice. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> only <b>add,</b> that during the middle part of his life he resided many years (as Incumbent of the Living) at a Parsonage in Oxfordshire, which is the subject of the seventh of the 'Miscellaneous Sonnets,' Part III.|$|R
6000|$|I cannot {{supply the}} information. And, before you condemn <b>me,</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> hastily <b>add</b> that the fault is not mine {{but that of}} Mrs. Hignett herself. The fact is, she never went to Buffalo. Schenectady saw nothing of her. She did not get within a {{thousand}} miles of Chicago, nor did she penetrate to St. Louis. For the very morning after her son Eustace sailed for England in the liner [...] "Atlantic," [...] she happened to {{read in the paper}} one of those abridged passenger-lists which the journals of New York are in the habit of printing, and got a nasty shock when she saw that, among those whose society Eustace would enjoy during the voyage, was [...] "Miss Wilhelmina Bennett, daughter of J. Rufus Bennett of Bennett, Mandelbaum and Co.". And within five minutes of digesting this information, she was at her desk writing out telegrams cancelling all her engagements. Iron-souled as this woman was, her fingers trembled as she wrote. She had a vision of Eustace and the daughter of J. Rufus Bennett strolling together on moonlit decks, leaning over rails damp with sea-spray and, in short, generally starting the whole trouble all over again.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{letter is}} stern and short. Major Milroy dismisses the report as unworthy of credit, {{because it is}} {{impossible}} for him to believe in such an act of 'cold-blooded treachery,' as the scandal would imply, if the scandal were true. He simply writes to warn Armadale that, if he is not more careful in his actions for the future, he must resign all pretensions to Miss Milroy's hand. 'I neither expect, nor wish for, an answer to this' (the letter ends), 'for I desire to receive no mere protestations in words. By your conduct, and by your conduct alone, I shall judge you as time goes on. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> also <b>add</b> that I positively forbid you to consider this letter as an excuse for violating the terms agreed on between us, by writing again to my daughter. You have no need to justify yourself in her eyes, for I fortunately removed her from Thorpe Ambrose before this abominable report had time to reach her; and I shall take good care, for her sake, that she is not agitated and unsettled by hearing it where she is now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us hope so," [...] {{concluded}} Bradley, with unabated gravity. [...] "And, {{now that}} you have consented, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add</b> from my own experience that Miss Minty's lemon-pies alone are worthy of any concession." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add</b> a {{postscript}} to the letter," [...] said Mr. Gilbert, [...] "and I am sure it {{will require}} no knapsack with a screw in the back to bring him quickly to us." ...|$|E
60|$|And now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>add</b> a {{few words}} more and thus bring to a close this long series of adventures in which the three Rover boys, Dick, Tom, and Sam, have played such an {{important}} part.|$|E
5000|$|... "Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Go" [...] {{was written}} by Florence Welch, Paul Epworth and Kid Harpoon while {{production}} was handled by Epworth. Florence and the Machine premiered [...] "Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Go" [...] along with two other songs from the album, [...] "Spectrum" [...] and [...] "Heartlines" [...] {{as part of their}} set list at New York's Creators Project on 15 October 2011, two weeks before the release of the album. Speaking about the song, Welch told Digital Spy, [...] "The gospel thing comes from my obsession with hymns. I'm drawn to anything that has a hymnal quality, be it Spiritualized or dusty old albums by Georgian choirs." [...] Island Records released [...] "Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Go" [...] as the third single from the album on 2 April 2012. A Clams Casino remix of the song was placed on the 12" [...] white vinyl single which was available for pre-order on 22 March 2012. The artwork for the vinyl single was shot by Karl Lagerfeld and was described by The Guardians Michael Cragg as [...] "swanky". Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine commented that the [...] "Clams Casino's remix of song... was the weirdest thing to happen to Florence Welch's voice". The Guardians Michael Cragg commented, [...] "He takes the stately Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Go and <b>adds</b> gusts of distorted backing vocals, big drum claps and, midway through, pitches Florence Welch's vocals down a notch or two to create what sounds like an eerie duet recorded in a cave." ...|$|R
60|$|My thirty-third lies {{now before}} me just finished, and I {{am going to}} seal and send it, so <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know whether you would have <b>me</b> <b>add</b> anything: I gave you my journal of this day; {{and it is now}} nine at night, and I am going to be busy for an hour or two.|$|R
60|$|Beautiful and {{touching}} to me your conjoined appeal, with dear Clare's, but I beg {{you to see}} the matter in the clear and happy light when I say that I'm afraid it won't do and that the blest Babe must really be placed, on the threshhold of life (there should be but one h there--don't teach her to spell by me!) under some more valid and more charming protection than that of my accumulated and before long so concluding years. She mustn't be taken, for her first happy holiday, to visit her late godfather's tomb--as would certainly be the case were I to lend myself to the fond anachronism her too rosy-visioned parents so flatteringly propose. You see, dear Wilfred, I speak from a wealth of wisdom and experience--life has made me rather exceptionally acquainted with the godpaternal function (so successful an impostor would I seem to have been,) and it was long since brought home {{to me that the}} character takes more wearing and its duties more performing than I feel I have ever been able to give it. I have three godchildren living (for to some I have been fatal)--two daughters and a son; and my conscience tells me that I have long grossly neglected them. They write me--at considerable length sometimes, and I just remember that I have one of their last sweet appeals still unanswered. This, dear Clare and dear Wilfred, is purely veracious history--a dark chapter in my life. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> not <b>add</b> another--let <b>me</b> show at last a decent compunction. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> not offer up a helpless and unconscious little career on the altar of my incompetence. Frankly, the lovely child should find at her font a younger and braver and nimbler presence, one that shall go on with her longer and become accessible to her personal knowledge. You will feel this together on easier reflection--just as you will see how my plea {{goes hand in hand with}} my deep appreciation of your exquisite confidence.|$|R
