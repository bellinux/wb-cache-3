25|$|On 1 January 1961 Kenzo Tange {{presented}} his new plan for Tōkyō Bay (1960) in a 45-minute television programme on NHK. The design was a radical {{plan for the}} reorganization and expansion of the capital in order to cater for a population beyond 10 million. The design was for a linear city that used a series of nine-kilometre modules that stretched 80km across Tōkyō Bay from Ikebukuro in the north west to Kisarazu in the south east. The perimeter {{of each of the}} modules was organised into three levels of looping highways, as Tange was adamant that an efficient communication system would be the key to modern living. The modules themselves were organised into building zones and transport hubs and included office, government administration and retail districts as well as a new Tōkyō train station and highway links to other parts of Tōkyō. Residential areas were to be accommodated on parallel streets that ran perpendicular to the main <b>linear</b> <b>axis</b> and like the Boston Bay project, people would build their own houses within giant A-frame structures.|$|E
25|$|The Heraion of Olympia (circa 600 BC) {{exemplifies the}} {{transition}} from wood to stone construction. This building, initially constructed entirely of wood and mudbrick, had its wooden columns gradually replaced with stone ones over time. Like a museum of Doric columns and Doric capitals, it contains examples of all chronological phases, up to the Roman period. One of the columns in the opisthodomos remained wooden {{at least until the}} 2nd century AD, when Pausanias described it. This 6 by 16 columns temple already called for a solution to the Doric corner conflict. It was achieved through a reduction of the corner intercolumniations the so-called corner contraction. The Heraion is most advanced in regards to the relationship between naos and peristasis, as it uses the solution that became canonical decades later, a <b>linear</b> <b>axis</b> running along the external faces of the outer naos walls and through the central axis of the associated columns. Its differentiation between wider intercolumnia on the narrow sides and narrower ones on the long sides was also an influential feature, as was the positioning of the columns within the cella, corresponding with those on the outside, a feature not repeated until the construction of the temple at Bassae 150 years later.|$|E

Basically, Jig is a work holding device which also guides the tool. The main purpose of making this Jig is to perform “chain drilling” without any need of shifting the job regularly, as the drilling spot is located by the movement of the tables on both X-Y directions. This results in reduction in production time and can be used for mass production. The movement of the tables is done with the help of lead screws. We have also screwed scales {{in the body of the}} jig so that the job doesn’t have to be measured again and again which will result in more time consumption, Therefore the main purpose of a <b>linear</b> two <b>axis</b> indexing drill jig is to drill proper, more accurate and precise holes...|$|R

Like any bearing, a dovetail slide is composed of a stationary linear base and a moving carriage. a Dovetail carriage has a v-shaped, or dovetail-shaped protruding channel which locks into the linear base's correspondingly shaped groove. Once the dovetail carriage is fitted into its base's channel, the carriage is locked into the channel's <b>linear</b> <b>axis</b> and allows free linear movement. When a platform {{is attached to the}} carriage of a dovetail slide, a dovetail table is created, offering extended load carrying capabilities.|$|E

50|$|Norberto Bobbio saw the {{polarization}} of the Italian Chamber of Deputies in the 1990s {{as evidence that}} the <b>linear</b> left-right <b>axis</b> remained valid. He thought that the argument that the spectrum had disappeared occurred when either the Left or Right were weak. The dominant side would claim that its ideology was the only possible one, while the weaker side would minimize its differences. He saw the Left and Right not in absolute terms, but as relative concepts that would vary over time. In his view, the left-right axis could be applied to any time period.|$|R
50|$|The {{crankshaft}} has a <b>linear</b> <b>axis</b> {{about which}} it rotates, typically with several bearing journals riding on replaceable bearings (the main bearings) {{held in the}} engine block. As the crankshaft undergoes {{a great deal of}} sideways load from each cylinder in a multicylinder engine, it must be supported by several such bearings, not just one at each end. This was a factor in the rise of V8 engines, with their shorter crankshafts, in preference to straight-8 engines. The long crankshafts of the latter suffered from an unacceptable amount of flex when engine designers began using higher compression ratios and higher rotational speeds. High performance engines often have more main bearings than their lower performance cousins for this reason.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{universal}} measuring {{machines were}} created to fill a need to continuously measure geometric features in both an absolute and comparative capacity, rather than a point based coordinate measuring system. A CMM provides a rapid method for inspecting absolute points, but geometric relationships must be calculated rather than measured directly. In theory? By using an accurate spindle with an electronic test indicator rather than a probe, a universal measuring machine fills this need. The indicator can be accurately controlled and moved across a part, either along a <b>linear</b> <b>axis</b> or radially around the spindle, to continuously record profile and geometry. This gives the universal machine a very strong advantage over other measuring methods when profiling radii, contours, and holes, as the detail of the feature can be of any arbitrary resolution. The analog record generated by the machine can be fed directly into a compensator on computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools, correcting the machine on a per-job basis.|$|E

40|$|By {{solving the}} two-active-electron, {{time-dependent}} Schrödinger equation in its full dimensionality, we investigate the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) dependence of single ionization of He to the He+(1 s) state triggered by an intense few-cycle attosecond pulse with carrier frequency ω {{corresponding to the}} energy ћω = 36 eV. Effects of electron correlations are probed by comparing projections of the final state of the two-electron wave packet onto field-free highly correlated Jacobi matrix wave functions with projections onto uncorrelated Coulomb wave functions. Significant differences {{are found in the}} vicinity of autoionizing resonances. Owing to the broad bandwidths of our 115 and 230 as pulses and their high intensities (1 – 2 PWcm− 2), asymmetries are found in the differential probability for ionization of electrons parallel and antiparallel to the <b>linear</b> polarization <b>axis</b> of the laser pulse. These asymmetries stem from interference of the one- and two-photon ionization amplitudes for producing electrons with the same momentum along the <b>linear</b> polarization <b>axis.</b> Whereas these asymmetries generally decrease with increasing ionized electron kinetic energy, we find a large enhancement of the asymmetry in the vicinity of two-electron doubly excited (autoionizing) states on an energy scale comparable to the widths of the autoionizing states. The CEP dependence of the energy-integrated asymmetry agrees very well with the predictions of time-dependent perturbation theory (Pronin et al 2009 Phys. Rev. A 80 063403) ...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{normally}} it {{is possible}} to obtain information about the wind direction from the orientation and form of sand dunes, the complexity of shapes of the Hagal dunes makes it difficult to determine the direction of the forming winds. In the case of the Hagal dunes, it is theorised that a local circular crater, probably formed due to meteorite impact and filled with sand, has decreased the quantity of dune-forming sand; this, in turn, impacted the local topography, causing a change in wind patterns. The linear dunes (dashes) were formed through the action of bidirectional winds, acting perpendicular to the line of the sand dune, causing a funneling effect directing the sand to accumulate along the <b>linear</b> <b>axis</b> of the dune. The round-shaped dunes (dots) were formed when the winds that caused the linearly-shaped accumulations were interrupted. The round dunes are classified as [...] "barchanoid dunes". However, the exact mechanism of either formation is still unknown and this is the reason the area was chosen for imaging by the HiRISE mission.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{building}} {{feature recognition}} systems that function effectively on real industrial products has been elusive. A real product {{with hundreds of}} faces and end edges brings almost all the above approaches to a halt due to computational complexity. Furthermore, the features studied in these approaches are usually over simplified. The bulk of the feature recognition literature normally deals with 2.5D features (those made by sweeping a 2D profile along a <b>linear</b> <b>axis).</b> Graph representations, hint definitions or volume decompositions are {{much more difficult to}} define for 3D and free form features. The work done by Sundararajan [...] is focused on free form surfaces, but again it is limited in application. Oversimplification is also evident even in the course of 2.5D features. For example, feature recognition algorithms usually assume sharp concave edges in the feature geometry. However, such edges are barely used in real design of mechanical components due to manufacturing constrains. Some of these issues such as the presence of filleted edges and free form surfaces in the model have been studied by Rahmani and Arezoo.|$|E
50|$|Early fusion {{research}} {{devices were}} variants on the Z-pinch and used electric current {{to generate a}} poloidal magnetic field to contain the plasma along a <b>linear</b> <b>axis</b> between two points. Researchers discovered that a simple toroidal field, in which the magnetic field lines run in circles around an axis of symmetry, confines a plasma hardly better than no field at all. This can be understood {{by looking at the}} orbits of individual particles. The particles not only spiral around the field lines, they also drift across the field. Since a toroidal field is curved and decreases in strength moving away from the axis of rotation, the ions and the electrons move parallel to the axis, but in opposite directions. The charge separation leads to an electric field and an additional drift, in this case outward (away from the axis of rotation) for both ions and electrons. Alternatively, the plasma {{can be viewed as a}} torus of fluid with a magnetic field frozen in. The plasma pressure results in a force that tends to expand the torus. The magnetic field outside the plasma cannot prevent this expansion. The plasma simply slips between the field lines.|$|E
