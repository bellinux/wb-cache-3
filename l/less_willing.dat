James {{believes}} that St Hill planned to play professional cricket in England around this point, but his {{failure in the}} trial matches meant {{that he was not}} selected to tour England with the West Indies team in 1923. James records how upset St Hill's supporters were by his omission and they believed the West Indian selectors feared a black batsman being successful in England. He also describes St Hill became more single-minded and <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> to moderate his approach after this decision.|$|E
5|$|The King's {{body was}} taken to Athens on the Amphitrite, escorted by a {{flotilla}} of naval vessels. For three days the coffin of the King, draped in the Danish and Greek flags, lay in the Metropolitan Cathedral in Athens before his body was committed to a tomb at his palace in Tatoi. Unlike his father, the new king, Constantine, was to prove <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> to accept the advice of ministers, or that of the three protecting powers (Britain, France and Russia).|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} CPGB, the Braddocks {{continued}} their socialist activism in Liverpool. Jack's {{role in the}} Merseyside Council of Action (an impromptu militant action group) during the 1926 General Strike made employers even <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> to engage him. He was rescued {{by the action of}} Sir Benjamin Johnson, a liberal-minded industrialist, who lent him the money to purchase a Co-operative Insurance Society agency. Jack and Bessie were now determined to pursue their political aims by democratic methods, and in 1926 they joined the Fairfield ward of the Liverpool Labour Party. In the 1929 Liverpool council elections, Jack was returned unopposed as the Labour councillor for the Fairfield ward. A year later Bessie joined him, elected in the St Anne's ward.|$|E

5|$|According to Sugiura, Monolith Soft's {{relations}} with Namco {{had undergone a}} negative change after Nakamura retired as head of Namco in 2002, three years before the merger with Bandai. The company underwent changes and Monolith Soft felt they were being given less creative freedom, and the newly-created Namco Bandai was <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> to take creative risks. The company then received consultation from Shinji Hatano, an executive director at Nintendo, who advised them to continue creating innovative projects. Spurred on by Hatano's supportive attitude, Monolith Soft decided {{to break away from}} Namco Bandai to become a Nintendo subsidiary; this provided Monolith Soft creative freedom in exchange for software development exclusivity for Nintendo platforms. Nintendo's purchasing of the majority of Monolith Soft's shares from Bandai Namco Holdings was publicly announced in April 2007. Nintendo became the majority shareholder of Monolith Soft with 80% of shares, while Bandai Namco retained 16% and remained as a development partner. Namco Bandai stated that the exchange of Monolith Soft shares would strengthen their relationship with Nintendo. The remaining shares were divided between Takahashi, Sugiura and Honne. Nintendo's acquisition of Monolith Soft contrasted against the company's previous publicized approach of not taking part in mergers and acquisitions of other studios and companies. In a statement on the matter, then-CEO of Nintendo Satoru Iwata said that the deal was initiated due to the positive relations between Sugiura and Nintendo, and the two company's parallel design and development philosophies.|$|E
25|$|Pit latrines {{are often}} {{relocated}} or re-built after some years (when the pit is full {{and if the}} pit is not emptied) and thus need more space than urine-diverting dry toilets for example and people are <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> {{to invest in a}} nice high-quality super-structure as {{it will have to be}} dismantled at some point.|$|E
25|$|UDDTs with vaults {{are also}} more {{permanent}} structures than most pit latrines, the latter of which in rural areas are typically relocated when the pit is full rather than emptying the pit.

25|$|The Victorian American {{conception}} {{of sexuality and}} other roles {{of men and women}} in society and to one another were being challenged. Modern clothing was lighter and more flexible, better suiting the modern woman such as the flapper who wanted to engage in active sport. Women were now becoming more assertive and <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> to keep the home fires burning. The flappers' costume was seen as sexual and raised deeper questions of the behavior and values it symbolized.|$|E
25|$|When a {{group member}} {{does not feel}} that his/her effort is {{justified}} {{in the context of}} the overall group, the individual will be <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> to assert the effort. If the group size is large, members can feel that their contribution will not be worth much to the overall cause because so many other contributions can or should occur. This leads people to not contribute as much or at all in large groups as they might have in smaller groups.|$|E
25|$|No mining could legally be {{done without}} being overseen by an overman or deputy. Their union, the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS) with 17,000 members in 1984, was <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> to take {{industrial}} action. Its constitution required a two-thirds majority for a national strike. During the 1972 strike, violent confrontations between striking NUM and non-striking NACODS members led to an agreement that NACODS members could stay off work without loss of pay if they were faced with aggressive picketing.|$|E

Tradition held up; Discovery successfully led Contador onto the famous street before the sprinting began. Freddy Bichot briefly got away on the second circuit. Chris Horner of Cadel Evans' Predictor-Lotto team tried to get away soon after, but the peloton was much <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> to let him leave. When Alejandro Valverde and Axel Merckx counter-attacked Bichot {{to bring him back}} into the field, Discovery faded back.|$|E
25|$|Navarro's {{candidacy}} was {{endorsed by}} sitting Council members Valerie Ervin, Nancy Floreen, Michael Knapp, and George L. Leventhal, noting Navarro's experience with difficult budget issues on the Board of Education. The editorial board of the Washington Post called Navarro {{a good choice for}} the position, but it favored her opponent State Delegate Ben Kramer, saying that while it was encouraged by Navarro's negotiation of smaller raises for teachers due to budgetary limitations, she was <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> to oppose positions of labor unions. County Executive Isiah Leggett endorsed Kramer.|$|E
25|$|David II {{would remain}} captive to the English until 1357, {{during much of}} which time he resided in the Tower of London. Among the combatants at Neville's Cross, Edward Balliol set about {{recruiting}} forces to join him on an excursion back into Scotland, while Henry Percy and John Neville swiftly pressed the English advantage in the borders. But though Balliol's subsequent campaign did restore some of the Southern communities to Edward III, on the whole he made little headway. Edward III was far {{more interested in the}} situation in France, and the Scottish locals were far <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> to submit to Balliol's demands.|$|E

25|$|The media often {{portray the}} salaryman in {{negative}} fashion {{for lack of}} initiative and originality. Because of this portrayal, communities may be <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> to help the salaryman with his emotional problems, which often leads to clinical depression or even suicide. Corporations are often more willing to fire salarymen to lower costs, and many Japanese students are attempting to veer off the typical path of graduating from college to enter a corporation and become a salaryman. The act of escaping from the corporate lifestyle is known as datsusara. A vivid portrait {{of this can be}} found in the 2002 Takeshi Kitano film, Dolls.|$|E
25|$|Boys are <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> {{to state}} they have {{negative}} feelings about sex than girls when they describe their sexual self-schemas. Boys are not divided into {{positive and negative}} sexual self-concepts; they are divided into schematic and non-schematic (a schema is a cluster of ideas about a process or aspect of the world; see schema). Boys who are sexually schematic are more sexually experienced, {{have higher levels of}} sexual arousal, and are more able to experience romantic feelings. Boys who are not schematic have fewer sexual partners, a smaller range of sexual experiences and are much less likely than schematic men to be in a romantic relationship.|$|E
25|$|In most poorer countries, health care—ranging {{from basic}} {{pharmaceuticals}} and postnatal care to costly multidrug therapies—remains very limited. Market forces drive private pharmaceutical companies, and many developed country government research programs, {{to focus on}} drugs needed in their environment, not necessarily those of the poorer countries. This is generating a growing controversy between rich and poorer nations over such issues as intellectual property rights, as some developing countries make their own copies, not always with permission, of drugs under patent protection. Developing countries also are <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> to make microbial samples available to companies that will make commercial vaccines from them, which may be too costly for the country that provided the sample.|$|E

25|$|Statehood was {{regarded}} as fairly imminent, as during {{the run-up to the}} 1864 presidential election the Republican–controlled Congress was actually eager to get two more Republican senators and three more electoral votes for President Lincoln's re-election bid. Territorial Governor John Evans persuaded Congress to adopt an enabling act, but a majority of the 6,192 Coloradoans who voted, in a population of around 35,000, turned down the first attempt at a state constitution and the second attempt at statehood. Later, at the end of 1865, territorial ambitions for statehood were thwarted again, this time by a veto by President Andrew Johnson. Statehood for the territory was a recurring issue during the Ulysses Grant administration, with Grant advocating statehood against a <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> Congress during Reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after this}} agonizing pedicure, the girl's broken toes were folded back under and the feet were rebound. The {{bindings}} were pulled even tighter {{each time the}} girl's feet were rebound. This unbinding and rebinding ritual was repeated {{as often as possible}} (for the rich at least once daily, for poor peasants {{two or three times a}} week), with fresh bindings. It was generally an elder female member of the girl's family or a professional foot binder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet. It was considered preferable to have someone other than the mother do it, as she might have been sympathetic to her daughter's pain and <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> to keep the bindings tight.|$|E
25|$|Males {{who are in}} a {{committed}} relationship, in other words have a restricted sociosexual orientation, will have different sexual strategies compared to males who have an unrestricted sociosexual orientation. Males with a restricted sociosexual orientation will be <b>less</b> <b>willing</b> to have sex outside of their committed relationship, and adjust their strategies according to their desire for commitment and emotional closeness with their partner. It has been found that such males are less likely to approach attractive females who have greater waist-to-hip ratios (0.68-0.72). It has been found that a greater waist-to-hip ratio, the ideal being 0.7, is associated with youthfulness, physical attractiveness and reproductive potential. Therefore, such females would be viewed as a risk to the male’s current sexual partner. Consequently, males will adjust their sexual strategies by showing less willingness to approach such females.|$|E
