Food storage houses - stabbur - were usually built on stilts in ways that made it {{difficult}} for mice and rats, but not cats, to get in. Exterior cladding varied by region, often to take into account <b>local</b> <b>climate</b> conditions. Roofs were often covered with birch bark and sod.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs {{have adapted}} to fill many open {{ecological}} niches since making their way to Madagascar. Their diversity in both behavior and morphology (outward appearance) rivals that of the monkeys and apes found elsewhere in the world. Ranging in size from the 30g (1.1oz) Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, the world's smallest primate, to the recently extinct 160–200kg (350–440lb) Archaeoindris fontoynonti, lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social complexity, and unique adaptations to the <b>local</b> <b>climate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pleistocene {{climate is}} harder to determine, though it was {{probably}} not much wetter than today, except in the mountains where precipitation increased. Drainage changes in the Colorado River Delta probably account {{for most of the}} water budget increases responsible for the formation of Lake Cahuilla. In the Mojave Desert large lakes also formed during that time. In the early Holocene the North American Monsoon strongly influenced the <b>local</b> <b>climate</b> and then progressively weakened.|$|E
5|$|Greenhouses convert solar {{light to}} heat, {{enabling}} year-round {{production and the}} growth (in enclosed environments) of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the <b>local</b> <b>climate.</b> Primitive greenhouses were first used during Roman times to produce cucumbers year-round for the Roman emperor Tiberius. The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad. Greenhouses remain {{an important part of}} horticulture today, and plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in polytunnels and row covers.|$|E

5|$|Modern cottage garden {{plants are}} {{typically}} flowers chosen for their old-fashioned and informal appeal. Many modern day gardeners use heirloom or 'old-fashioned' plants and varieties—even though these {{may not have}} been authentic or traditional cottage garden plants. In addition, there are modern varieties of flowers that fit into the cottage garden look. For example, modern roses developed by David Austin have been chosen for cottage gardens because of their old-fashioned look (multi-petaled form and rosette-shaped flowers) and fragrance—combined with modern virtues of hardiness, repeat blooming, and disease-resistance. Modern cottage gardens often use native plants and those adapted to the <b>local</b> <b>climate,</b> rather than trying to force traditional English plants to grow in an incompatible environment—though many of the old favorites thrive in cottage gardens throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand's native Cordyline {{species are}} relics of {{an influx of}} {{tropical}} plants that arrived from the north 15 million {{years ago in the}} warm Miocene era. Because it has evolved in response to the <b>local</b> <b>climate,</b> geology and other factors, C.australis varies in appearance from place to place. This variation can alter the overall appearance of the tree, canopy shape and branch size, the relative shape and size of the leaves, and their colour and stiffness. There may also be invisible adaptations for resistance to disease or insect attack. Some of these regional provenances are different enough to have been named by North Island Māori: Tītī in the north, tī manu in the central uplands, tarariki in the east and wharanui in the west.|$|E
5|$|Over 80% of Chad's {{population}} {{relies on}} subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood. The crops grown and {{the locations of}} herds {{are determined by the}} <b>local</b> <b>climate.</b> In the southernmost 10% of the territory lies the nation's most fertile cropland, with rich yields of sorghum and millet. In the Sahel only the hardier varieties of millet grow, and these with much lower yields than in the south. On the other hand, the Sahel is ideal pastureland for large herds of commercial cattle and for goats, sheep, donkeys and horses. The Sahara's scattered oases support only some dates and legumes. Chad's cities face serious difficulties of municipal infrastructure; only 48% of urban residents have access to potable water and only 2% to basic sanitation.|$|E
50|$|Dendroclimatology is {{the science}} of {{determining}} past climates from trees primarily from {{the properties of the}} annual tree rings.

40|$|There {{are various}} <b>local</b> and {{regional}} <b>climates</b> on the Earth's surface. While the overall {{climate of the}} Earth is often the focus of research and discussion, individual <b>local</b> <b>climates</b> are important to consider when thinking of indigenous plants and animals. In this lesson, students will choose two locations, preferably in different climate zones, and compare real NASA satellite data for those two locations. The data comes from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISSCP) and the Surface Radiation Budget Project (SRB). They will analyze solar radiation downward flux between locations to identify patterns and determine variables that {{may be responsible for}} differences. Educational levels: Middle school...|$|R
25|$|Despite {{technological}} advances, such as improved varieties, {{genetically modified}} organisms, and irrigation systems, weather {{is still a}} key factor in agricultural productivity, as well as soil properties and natural communities. The effect of climate on agriculture is related to variabilities in <b>local</b> <b>climates</b> rather than in global climate patterns. The Earth's average surface temperature has increased by 1.5°F (0.83°C) since 1880. Consequently, agronomists consider any assessment has to be individually consider each local area.|$|R
5|$|The {{climate of}} Strandzha is {{influenced}} by the proximity of the Black, Marmara and Aegean seas which clearly distinguishes the <b>local</b> <b>climate</b> from that of the rest of Bulgaria. The region is among the warmest in the country with temperatures rarely falling below 0°C in winter and rising above 24°C in summer due to the cooling effect of the Black Sea. The average temperature drops with the rising elevation in the interior which creates conditions for more frequent and longer-lasting mists, heavier snowfall and earlier frosts. In winter frequent fogs lead to hard rime and the icing of the forests at altitudes above 50.|$|E
5|$|The common {{features}} of passive solar architecture are orientation {{relative to the}} Sun, compact proportion (a low surface area to volume ratio), selective shading (overhangs) and thermal mass. When these features are tailored to the <b>local</b> <b>climate</b> and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. Socrates' Megaron House {{is a classic example}} of passive solar design. The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package. Active solar equipment such as pumps, fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of an activity into a sport {{and then an}} entertainment is also affected by the <b>local</b> <b>climate</b> and conditions. For example, the modern sport of surfing is associated with Hawaii and that of snow skiing probably evolved in Scandinavia. While these sports and the entertainment they offer to spectators have spread around the world, people in the two originating countries remain well known for their prowess. Sometimes the climate offers a chance to adapt another sport {{such as in the}} case of ice hockey—an important entertainment in Canada.|$|E

5|$|The {{geography}} in {{the area}} affects the <b>local</b> <b>climate</b> of the city with the Aarhus Bay imposing a temperate effect on the low-lying valley floor where central Aarhus is located. Brabrand Lake to the west further contributes to this effect {{and as a result}} the valley has a very mild, temperate climate. The sandy ground on the valley floor dries up quickly after winter and warms faster in the summer than the surrounding hills of moist-retaining boulder clay. These conditions affect crops and plants that often bloom 1–2 weeks earlier in the valley than on the northern and southern hillsides.|$|E
5|$|Trade winds blow {{from east}} to west across the Hawaiian islands, and the {{presence}} of Mauna Loa strongly affects the <b>local</b> <b>climate.</b> At low elevations, the eastern (windward) side of the volcano receives heavy rain; the city of Hilo is the wettest in the United States. The rainfall supports extensive forestation. The western (leeward) side has a much drier climate. At higher elevations, the amount of precipitation decreases, and skies are very often clear. Very low temperatures mean that precipitation often occurs in the form of snow, and the summit of Mauna Loa is described as a periglacial region, where freezing and thawing {{play a significant role in}} shaping the landscape.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} are not endangered. Their {{future is}} stable {{because of their}} abundance and adaptability. However, specific populations are threatened due to various environmental changes. The population in the Moray Firth in Scotland is estimated to consist of around 190 individuals, and are under threat from harassment, traumatic injury, water pollution and reduction in food availability. Likewise, an isolated population in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, is in decline due to calf loss coincident {{to an increase in}} warm freshwater discharge into the fjord. Less <b>local</b> <b>climate</b> change, such as increasing water temperature may also play a role but has never been shown to be the case. One of the largest coastal populations of bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia was forecast to be stable with little variation in mortality over time (Manlik et al. 2016).|$|E

30|$|Based on {{the study}} of the three largest Chinese city clusters, we found that {{residents}} of southern China tended to be more vulnerable to low temperature stress, but that the northern population was more sensitive to heat stress. Furthermore, the extreme cold-related mortality risk was consistently higher than that of heat. Therefore, it is important to develop different public health policies such as early warning/forecasting system, climate-adapted plan (NDRC 2016), among others, for both extreme cold and heat events, and for different regions according to their specific <b>local</b> <b>climates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dendroclimatology is {{the science}} of {{determining}} past climates from trees (primarily properties of the annual tree rings).

Using tree rings, scientists have estimated many <b>local</b> <b>climates</b> for hundreds to thousands of years previous. By combining multiple tree-ring studies (sometimes with other climate proxy records), scientists have estimated past regional and global climates.|$|R
5|$|In early 1953, the Việt Minh under Võ Nguyên Giáp {{commenced}} {{an invasion}} of Laos to exert additional pressure on Paris and on the French forces stationed in Indochina. In the area of Muong Khoua were the Việt Minh 308th, 312th and 316th divisions, whose long supply lines were maintained by a veritable army of 200,000 porters. The French command—headed then by Raoul Salan—ordered {{the establishment of a}} series of French outposts in northern Laos to resist the Việt Minh invading forces {{for as long as possible}} to buy time for the fortification of Luang Prabang and Vientiane, the capital cities of Laos. The King of Laos, Sisavang Vong, remained in Luang Prabang, which added greater impetus to French efforts. The terrain of northern Laos, and the <b>local</b> <b>climate,</b> isolated many of the outposts with a night-time fog known as crachin, thick jungle, a lack of roads, and steep terrain. Each outpost was given a certain number of days to withstand Việt Minh forces, including Muong Khoua which was issued orders on April 13 to hold for fourteen days—until April 27.|$|E
5|$|In {{partnership}} with the goddess Brìghde, the Cailleach {{is seen as a}} seasonal deity or spirit, ruling the winter months between Samhainn (1 November or first day of winter) and Bealltainn (1 May or first day of summer), while Brìghde rules the summer months between Bealltainn and Samhainn. Some interpretations have the Cailleach and Brìghde as two faces of the same goddess, while others describe the Cailleach as turning to stone on Bealltainn and reverting to humanoid form on Samhainn in time to rule over the winter months. Depending on <b>local</b> <b>climate,</b> the transfer of power between the winter goddess and the summer goddess is celebrated any time between Là Fhèill Brìghde (1 February) at the earliest, Latha na Cailliche (25 March), or Bealltainn (1 May) at the latest, and the local festivals marking the arrival of the first signs of spring may be named after either the Cailleach or Brìghde.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{in the late}} 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally {{introduced}} into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate {{a wide range of}} water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the <b>local</b> <b>climate</b> from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels.|$|E
