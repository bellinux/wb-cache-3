40|$|International audienceIt seems {{necessary}} {{to detect a}} broken bike rooted at a station in near realtime {{as the number of}} bikes within bikeshare systems has reached more than a million in 2015. Indeed, a bike that cannot be moved is not cost effective in terms of number of trips. This brings frustration to users who were expecting to find a bike at that station without knowing that it is actually defective. We thus propose a methodology from feature extraction to anomaly detection on a distributed cloud infrastructure in order to detect bicycles requiring a repair. Through a first step of K-means clustering, and a second step consisting of spotting samples that do not clearly belong to any cluster, we separate anomalies from normal behaviors. The proposal is validated on a publicly available dataset provided by Motivate, the operator of the New-York bikeshare system. The number of distinct bikes that have been classified by this algorithm as broken at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> during <b>a</b> <b>month</b> is close to the number of repairs given in monthly reports of Motivate...|$|R

Older films are also popular on the circuit, {{appreciated}} largely in an imposed camp fashion—a midnight movie tradition that goes back to the 1972 revival of the hectoring anti-drug movie Reefer Madness (1938).

Method: A large cross sectional survey (n = 1373) was conducted in educational establishments in England and sexual event diaries were completed by a subsample of young people over <b>a</b> 6 <b>month</b> period. Results: Of the 375 survey respondents who reported having used a condom on the most recent occasion of vaginal sex, 6 % had applied the condom after penetration and 6 % had continued penetration after condom removal. Of the 74 diary respondents, 31 % applied a condom late and 9 % removed a condom early at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> over <b>a</b> 6 <b>month</b> period. The odds of "imperfect" condom use were found to decrease with overall consistency of condom use, confidence in correct condom use, positive reported relationship with mother, non-use of other contraception, and desire to use a condom. Conclusion: Given that late application and early removal of condoms fail to maximise their effectiveness {{as a method of}} STI prevention, it is important to address "imperfect" condom use and the factors associated with such use in public health policies and programmes. It is essential that young people understand the importance of using condoms consistently and correctly, and are also equipped with the skills and knowledge to do so...|$|R

An observational survey was conducted among university students at Trieste University (Italy) in spring 2014. Students answered an anonymous self-administered questionnaire about sexual harassment, including three domains—sexual harassment, unwanted comments on physical appearance, cyber-harassment—and disordered eating behaviors. The global sexual harassment index was computed with three levels: Level 0, no harassment; Level 1, harassment in at least one of the three domains; and Level 2, harassment in two or three domains. Disordered eating behaviors were classified by at least one of the following: (a) eating without being able to stop or vomiting at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> or twice <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> (b) using laxatives or diuretics at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> or twice <b>a</b> week, (c) monitoring weight every day, and (d) dieting at least very often.

Experiencing sexual harassment was related to eating disorder symptoms for both genders with a regular gradient: the higher the harassment score, the more frequent the disordered eating behavior symptoms, even after adjusting for age and previous sexual violence. The association was stronger for males than females. Sexual harassment and disordered eating behaviors have long been considered mainly a female problem.

Sleep disorders can affect driving skills, but the relative impact of sleep complaints among a large population of highway drivers is still unknown. Out of 37, 648 questionnaires completed by frequent highway users (registered in an electronic payment system), we ran our analyses on 35, 004 drivers who responded to all items. The questionnaire previously used in a telephone survey included socio-demographics, driving and sleep disorders items (Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Of all drivers, 16. 9 % complained {{of at least one}} sleep disorder, 5. 2 % reported obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, 9. 3 % insomnia, and 0. 1 % narcolepsy and hypersomnia; 8. 9 % of drivers reported experiencing at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> each <b>month</b> <b>an</b> episode of sleepiness at the wheel so severe they had to stop driving. One-third of the drivers (31. 1 %) reported near-miss accidents (50 % being sleep-related), 2520 drivers (7. 2 %) reported a driving accident in the past year, and 146 (5. 8 %) of these driving accidents were sleep-related. The highest risk of accidents concerned patients suffering from narcolepsy and hypersomnia (odds ratio 3. 16, p<. 01) or multiple sleep disorders (odds ratio 1. 46, p<. 001). Other major risk factors were age [18 - 30 years (OR 1. 42, p<. 001) ] and being unmarried (OR 1. 21 -fold, p<. 01). In regular highway drivers, sleepiness at the wheel or sleep disorders such as hypersomnia and narcolepsy are responsible for traffic accidents independent of age, sex, marital status or socio-professional categories...|$|R
