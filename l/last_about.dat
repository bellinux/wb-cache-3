5|$|Plant recolonization and {{succession}} {{has occurred}} in Glacier Bay {{as a result of}} the retreat of the glacier bay in the <b>last</b> <b>about</b> 300 years. The succession, which occurred in the new wilderness of Glacier Bay was stated to be a raw landscape. A simile given is that “It was like seeing an owl with no feathers”. A vegetative wilderness has been created, which has resulted in the coastal forest. 333 Vascular plant species of individual taxa have been recorded in the Glacier Bay. Dense thickets of Sitka alder and devil's club abound along the shoreline.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} hunts in short dives, often {{to the sea}} floor. Although it can hold its breath {{for up to five}} minutes, its dives {{typically}} <b>last</b> <b>about</b> one minute and no more than four. It is the only marine animal capable of lifting and turning over rocks, which it often does with its front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may also pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into underwater mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth.|$|E
5|$|These ulcers occur {{periodically}} {{and heal}} completely between attacks. In {{the majority of}} cases, the individual ulcers <b>last</b> <b>about</b> 7–10 days, and ulceration episodes occur 3–6 times per year. Most appear on the non-keratinizing epithelial surfaces in the mouth (i.e. anywhere except the attached gingiva, the hard palate and the dorsum of the tongue), although the more severe forms, which are less common, may also involve keratinizing epithelial surfaces. Symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering with eating and drinking. The severe forms may be debilitating, even causing weight loss due to malnutrition.|$|E

50|$|Well defined {{diapause}} as mature larvae in cocoons {{occurs at}} low temperatures in some individuals of Ptinus fur: at 23 °C this <b>lasts</b> <b>about</b> 220 days after normal larvae have pupated; at 20 °C the period <b>lasts</b> <b>about</b> 280 days.|$|R
5|$|Dragon Ball was loosely {{modeled on}} the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. Torishima said he chose it largely {{because it was a}} free {{intellectual}} property, but also because its Chinese setting was not common in manga at the time and would make it both unique and differentiate it from Dr. Slumps West Coast of the United States feel. While the characters in Journey to the West travel to collect sacred scrolls, Toriyama added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give the characters a game-like activity of gathering something in order to appeal to its shōnen magazine audience. With Goku being Sun Wukong, Bulma as Xuanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie, and Yamcha being Sha Wujing, he originally thought the story would <b>last</b> <b>about</b> a year, or end once the Dragon Balls were collected. Toriyama said that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand, he specifically aimed Dragon Ball at an older audience.|$|E
5|$|Female {{cats are}} {{seasonally}} polyestrous, {{which means they}} may have many periods of heat {{over the course of}} a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and <b>last</b> <b>about</b> 4 to 7 days. Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing penile spines, which are about 1mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which acts to induce ovulation. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.|$|E
5|$|New York City actress Ash ("Liz") Sroka voices Tali {{throughout}} the Mass Effect trilogy, her first {{role in a}} video game. Sroka auditioned for three different roles: the female Commander Shepard, Tali'Zorah, and one other female character. After initially receiving the role of Tali, she was still unsure of how much material there was. Ginny McSwain gave voice direction, and would generally take two takes—the first to use, the second as back-up, and occasionally a third or more if the recording did not fit with what she wanted. Recording sessions would generally <b>last</b> <b>about</b> four hours. Sroka herself is not a gamer, though she says she enjoys the character of Tali and is happy to have landed the role.|$|E

5|$|Within 50 million years, the {{pressure}} and density of hydrogen in {{the centre of the}} protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion. Isochrones for Solar Mixture | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement | arxiv=astro-ph/0104292 | date=2001 | volume=136 |issue=2 | pages=417–437 | doi=10.1086/321795 | bibcode=2001ApJS..136..417Y}} The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure equalled the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star. The main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will <b>last</b> <b>about</b> 10 billion years for the Sun compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the Sun's pre-remnant life combined. Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space, ending the planetary formation process. The Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin is metabolized {{mostly in}} the liver. As it becomes {{converted}} to psilocin, it undergoes a first-pass effect, whereby its concentration is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation. Psilocin is broken down by the enzyme monoamine oxidase to produce several metabolites that can circulate in the blood plasma, including 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde, 4-hydroxytryptophol, and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid. Some psilocin is not broken down by enzymes and instead forms a glucuronide; this is a biochemical mechanism animals use to eliminate toxic substances by linking them with glucuronic acid, which can then be excreted in the urine. Psilocin is glucuronated by the glucuronosyltransferase enzymes UGT1A9 in the liver, and by UGT1A10 in the small intestine. Based on studies using animals, about 50% of ingested psilocybin is absorbed through the stomach and intestine. Within 24hours, about 65% of the absorbed psilocybin is excreted into the urine, and a further 15–20% is excreted in the bile and feces. Although {{most of the remaining}} drug is eliminated in this way within 8hours, it is still detectable in the urine after 7days. Clinical studies show that psilocin concentrations in the plasma of adults average about 8µg/liter within 2hours after ingestion of a single 15mg oral psilocybin dose; psychological effects occur with a blood plasma concentration of 4–6µg/liter. Psilocybin is about 100 times less potent than LSD on a weight per weight basis, and the physiological effects <b>last</b> <b>about</b> half as long.|$|E

25|$|Using a solar roof, {{solar cells}} can provide {{electric}} power. Solar roofs {{have the potential}} to be more cost-effective than retrofitted solar power, because buildings need roofs anyway. Modern solar cells <b>last</b> <b>about</b> 40 years, which makes them a reasonable investment in some areas. At a sufficient angle, solar cells are cleaned by run-off rain water and therefore have almost no life-style impact.|$|E
25|$|Some {{deterioration}} {{occurs on}} each charge–discharge cycle. Degradation usually occurs because electrolyte migrates {{away from the}} electrodes or because active material detaches from the electrodes. Low-capacity NiMH batteries (1,700–2,000mA·h) can be charged some 1,000 times, whereas high-capacity NiMH batteries (above 2,500mA·h) <b>last</b> <b>about</b> 500 cycles.
