50|$|RPKI {{provides}} a way to connect Internet number resource information (such as Autonomous System numbers and IP addresses) to a trust anchor. The certificate structure mirrors {{the way in which}} Internet number resources are distributed. That is, resources are initially distributed by the IANA to the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), who in turn distribute them to Local Internet registries (LIRs), who then distribute the resources to their customers. RPKI can be used by the <b>legitimate</b> <b>holders</b> of the resources to control the operation of Internet routing protocols to prevent route hijacking and other attacks. In particular, RPKI is used to secure the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) through BGPSEC, as well as Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ND) for IPv6 through the Secure Neighbor Discovery Protocol (SEND).|$|R
40|$|The {{smallest}} of Europe's microstates {{have experienced a}} unique, lengthy and incremental passage to sovereignty and their full participation in the organised relations of the international system. This contribution focuses on the long struggle of these states to achieve state equality and allowing their inclusion as equal members in interstate organisations and as <b>legitimate</b> <b>holders</b> of the full rights of legation. Important in this narrative is the incremental strategies of the microstates themselves, the waning interest in further exclusion by the international community, and the pressure and interventions exerted by neighbours, particularly the Council of Europe. The conclusion offers a comparative assessment of the smallest states {{in the developing world}} in a similar population class which never faced questions of legitimacy undermining their status and inclusion but which are extremely hard pressed economically in comparison to their wealthy European counterparts...|$|R

50|$|The Jin Dynasty {{tradition}} of an incoming dynasty writing the official history {{for the one}} immediately preceding has been seen to foster an ethnically inclusive interpretation of history. The compilation of official histories usually involved monumental intellectual labor. The Yuan and Qing Dynasties, which might be thought foreign, faithfully carried out this practice, writing the official Chinese-language histories of the Han-ruled Song and Ming Dynasties, respectively. Had these two non-Han imperial families not thought of themselves as continuing the Mandate of Heaven of the Middle Kingdom, {{it would be hard}} to explain why they retained the costly tradition. Thus, every non-Han dynasty saw itself as the <b>legitimate</b> <b>holder</b> of the Mandate of Heaven, which legitimized the dynastic cycle regardless of social or ethnic background.|$|E
40|$|Intellectual {{property}} {{is every bit}} as important as physical property. For many corporations, intangible assets like brands and trademarks are even more valuable than tangible assets (Hopkins, 2003). For example, the Coca-Cola brand name is far more valuable than the ingredients that go into a can of Coca-Cola (Hopkins, 2003). Businesses expend a great deal of time, energy, and resources to protect their ideas, brands, and identities from counterfeiters and intellectual property infringers. Firms do this not only to preserve their reputations and profitability, but also to prevent the consumer from unknowingly purchasing unsafe, low-quality goods from unscrupulous dealers. A substantial number of governments have enacted laws and treaties that protect <b>legitimate</b> <b>holders</b> of intellectual property and punish infringers in order to protect their citizens and local industries from those who would attempt to usurp the brand names of successful companies. Despite these attempts to defend intellectual property rights, however, counterfeiting remains rife. Counterfeit goods cost the American economy as much as $ 250 billion a year, and counterfeiting is responsible for the loss of over 750, 000 America...|$|R

50|$|The 11th Panchen Lama {{controversy}} is a dispute {{about the current}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>holder</b> of the Panchen Lama title, a political and religious leadership position in Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism. After {{the death of the}} 10th Panchen Lama, a dispute between the Chinese leadership and the exiled 14th Dalai Lama resulted in two competing candidates. The search committee process involving monks in Tibet under the strict supervision of the Chinese communist regime was disrupted when the Dalai Lama, according to the Tibetan tradition, unilaterally announced his selection of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima. The leadership in China spirited Nyima away to prevent his being taken to India by the Dalai Lama's supporters and reverted to the Qing Dynasty's Golden Urn process to select Gyaincain Norbu, who currently fulfills the duties of the Panchen Lama in China.|$|E

5000|$|In January 2014, the MEF {{issued the}} Guidelines {{containing}} the “Regulations for the Administrative Process of Recording, Adjusting and Paying the Land Reform Bond Debt.” The Guidelines {{set out a}} “mandatory” procedure for bondholder claims.

[...] Sovereign debt restructuring is not uncommon, and Peru has - as a matter of fact - restructured its sovereign debt several times in the past. But it has never asked creditors to waive their procedural rights just to reconcile the amount due. This is followed by a complex, bureaucratic and uncertain administrative process. That process could take up to seven years before the bondholders receive any value: five years for bondholders to file their “applications” to be “officially identified and registered” as the Bonds’ <b>legitimate</b> <b>holders,</b> followed by a two-year process to hear each individual claim. This two-year period consists of eighteen months for the MEF to “register” the application; and six months to finalize the “administrative updating.” ...|$|R
50|$|The {{territorial}} government's {{ability to}} function was severely impacted by {{the two sets of}} territorial officials.

50|$|The turning-point of {{his life}} was Gobel's action in taking the oath of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (3 January 1791), in favour {{of which he had}} {{declared}} himself since 5 May 1790.

He chose the Archbishopric of Paris, and in spite of the difficulties which he had to encounter before he could enter into possession, he took up office on 17 March 1791 and was consecrated on 27 March by eight bishops, including Charles Maurice de Talleyrand.

40|$|Identity documents, such as ID cards, passports, and driver's licenses, contain textual information, a {{portrait}} of the <b>legitimate</b> <b>holder,</b> and eventually some other biometric characteristics such as a ngerprint or handwritten signature. As prices for digital imaging technologies fall, making them more widely available, we have seen an exponential increase in the ease and the number of counterfeiters that can eectively forge documents. Today, with only limited knowledge of technology and a small amount of money, a counterfeiter can eortlessly replace a photo or modify identity information on a legitimate document {{to the extent that it}} is very dicult to dierentiate from the original. This paper proposes a virtually fraud-proof ID document based on a combination of three dierent data hiding technologies: digital watermarking, 2 -D bar codes, and Copy Detection Pattern, plus additional biometric protection. As will be shown, that combination of data hiding technologies protects the document against any forgery, in principle without any requirement for other security features. To prevent a genuine document to be used by an illegitimate user,biometric information is also covertly stored in the ID document, to be used for identi cation at the detector...|$|E
40|$|Although NATO {{intervened in}} Libya during the {{revolution}} {{there was no}} large international force present in the transitional phase: the timeframe {{between the end of}} the violent conflict and the first elections. Consequently Libyans themselves, headed by the self-appointed National Transitional Council (NTC) and the interim government, were responsible for forming state institutions and preparing the country for its first post-conflict elections. However, as a consequence of Qaddafi's 'stateless society' and the revolution of 2011 itself, there was no institutionalized security force that the newly formed political entities could utilize in order to provide security during the transitional phase. As a result, the multiple brigades that were formed by the revolutionary fighters {{over the course of the}} uprising became active in the security field afterwards. This resulted in a situation in which security was not provided by a single entity, such as the state, but rather by numerous different brigades and institutions. This research provides insight into the different processes and dynamics that occur within a security field after an international intervention and successful revolution. It will be argued that the brigades in Tripoli on the one hand have used their position as holders of the means of violence in the capital as leverage in their negotiations with the political entities, whilst on the other hand the brigades needed to uphold their reputations as invaluable security providers in the field in order to legitimize their use of violence and justify their existence in a territorial oligopoly of violence. This entailed using the state's image as the only <b>legitimate</b> <b>holder</b> of violence as a mechanism to legalize the actions of a brigade. However, interaction between the actors in the security field occurred in an uncoordinated and impersonalized manner, leader to the exclusion of several, both in and outside of Tripoli. Without alternatives such as an accessible political infrastructure, violence was therefore also used as a means to communicate with the political authorities...|$|E
