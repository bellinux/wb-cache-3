It is a limited morphing wing with adaptive features for continuously optimising the wing loading to reduce fuel burn: variable camber for longitudinal <b>load</b> <b>control</b> where inboard & outboard flaps deflect together and differential flaps setting for lateral <b>load</b> <b>control</b> where inboard & outboard flaps deflect differentially.|$|E
25|$|Time of Day {{metering}} (TOD), {{also known}} as Time of Usage (TOU) or Seasonal Time of Day (SToD), metering involves dividing the day, month and year into tariff slots and with higher rates at peak load periods and low tariff rates at off-peak load periods. While this {{can be used to}} automatically control usage {{on the part of the}} customer (resulting in automatic <b>load</b> <b>control),</b> it is often simply the customer's responsibility to control his own usage, or pay accordingly (voluntary <b>load</b> <b>control).</b> This also allows the utilities to plan their transmission infrastructure appropriately.

50|$|A <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> is {{a protein}} {{used as a}} control in a Western {{blotting}} experiment.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {{has been}} used to {{identify}} biomarkers of neurological disease. CSF protein biomarkers identified by high-throughput methods, however, require further validation. While Western blotting (WB) is well-suited to this task, the lack of a validated <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> for CSF WB limits the method's accuracy. New methodWe investigated the use of total protein (TP) as a CSF WB <b>loading</b> <b>control.</b> Using iodine-based reversible membrane staining, we determined the linear range and consistency of the CSF TP signal. We then spiked green fluorescent protein (GFP) into CSF to create defined sample-to-sample differences in GFP levels that were measured by WB before and after TP loading correction. Levels of CSF complement C 3 and cystatin C measured by WB with TP loading correction and ELISA in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and healthy control CSF samples were then compared. ResultsCSF WB with the TP <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> accurately detected defined differences in GFP levels and corrected for simulated loading errors. Individual CSF sample Western blot and ELISA measurements of complement C 3 and cystatin C were significantly correlated and the methods showed a comparable ability to detect between-groups differences. Comparison with existing methodCSF TP staining has a greater linear dynamic range and sample-to-sample consistency than albumin, a commonly used CSF <b>loading</b> <b>control.</b> The method accurately corrects for simulated errors in loading and improves the sensitivity of CSF WB compared to using no <b>loading</b> <b>control.</b> ConclusionsThe TP staining <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> improves the sensitivity and accuracy of CSF WB results...|$|R

25|$|TAP began 1974 with 32 {{state-of-the-art}} aircraft operating to {{more than}} 40 destinations on four continents, it began offering computerised reservations, <b>load</b> <b>control</b> and check-in (known as Tapmatic), {{and became the first}} European airline to carry out major comprehensive overhauls of the Boeing 747 engines. By the end of 1974, TAP had carried more than 1.5 million passengers, flown 68,210 hours over a network of almost 103,000 kilometres and had a staff of over 9,000. Following the 25 April 1974 revolution, Portugal was caught up in the wave of nationalisations during the following year and TAP was no exception, thus becoming a state-owned corporation in 1975.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The use of “Housekeeping {{proteins}} ” as <b>loading</b> <b>controls</b> {{in western}} blots requires {{that they do}} not change their level of expression. However, deviations from this rule have been observed. This study investigated the expression of the commonly used proteins HSP 60, -tubulin, -actin and GAPDH by western blot during retinoic acid-induced differentia-tion of the embryonal carcinoma NTera- 2 and the neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cell lines. -actin was found to be a poor <b>loading</b> <b>control,</b> increasing significantly during differentiation, whereas HSP 60 and GAPDH were the more evenly ex-pressed of those analysed. Our results underline the importance of selecting accurate <b>loading</b> <b>controls</b> in this biological context...|$|R

40|$|Western blot of {{synovial}} fluid {{has been widely}} used for osteoarthritis (OA) research and diagnosis, {{but there is no}} ideal <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> for this purpose. Although β-actin is extensively used as <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> in western blot, it is not suitable for {{synovial fluid}} because it is not required in synovial fluid as a cytoskeletal protein. A good <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> for synovial fluid in OA studies should have unchanged content in synovial fluids from normal and OA groups, because synovial fluid protein content can vary with changes in synovial vascular permeability with OA onset. In this study, we explore the potential of using α 1 -antitripsin (A 1 AT) as <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> for OA synovial fluid in western blot. A 1 AT level is elevated in inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Unlike RA, OA is a non-inflammation disease, which does not induce A 1 AT. In this study, we identified A 1 AT as an abundant component of synovial fluid by Mass Spectrometry and confirmed that the level of A 1 AT is relative constant between human OA and normal synovial fluid by western blot and ELISA. Hence, we proposed that A 1 AT may be a good <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> for western blot in human OA synovial fluid studies provided that pathological conditions such as RA or A 1 AT deficiency associated liver or lung diseases are excluded...|$|R

50|$|Lufthansa's move to {{outsource}} its <b>load</b> <b>controlling</b> needs to its centers in Cape Town, Istanbul and Brno where motivated by more affordable operations costs.

40|$|AbstractAn {{accurate}} {{determination of}} the pressure to cause plastic collapse of a pipe is important when considering its structural integrity. This paper explores {{the way in which}} initial stresses, induced by either <b>load</b> or displacement <b>controlled</b> bending, influence plastic collapse as a result of internal pressure. Both open ended and closed ended pipes are considered. The effect of initial bending stresses created by far-field displacement is often considered to be similar to <b>load</b> <b>controlled</b> stresses. Using three dimensional finite element analysis it is demonstrated that global collapse pressures for <b>load</b> and displacement <b>controlled</b> conditions may be significantly different. For both pipe end conditions <b>load</b> <b>controlled</b> bending affects the plastic collapse pressure. However, displacement controlled bending has little influence...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a model of}} {{distributed}} power system with power electronic <b>controlled</b> <b>loads.</b> Distribution networks transport the electrical energy from the transmission substations to the various loads. There are so many power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads</b> that are connected in the distribution power system. Due to intensive use of power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads</b> in an industry and other consumers in general, the harmonics produces a distortion in distribution network. Therefore, to protect the power system from the power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads,</b> {{it is very important}} to identify the types and number of all the working power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads.</b> The result of this paper shows that the method of calculating the number and also the types of all working power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads</b> in any distribution system.
