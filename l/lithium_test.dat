40|$|Background: Microchip {{capillary}} electrophoresis (CE) is a promising method for chemical analysis of complex samples such as whole blood. We evaluated the method for point-of-care <b>testing</b> of <b>lithium.</b> Methods: Chemical separation {{was performed on}} standard glass microchip CE devices with a conductivity detector as described in previous work. Here we demonstrate a new sample-to-chip interface. Initially, we took a glass capillary as a sample collector for whole blood from a finger stick. In addition, we designed a novel disposable sample collector and tested it against the clinical standard at the hospital (Medisch Spectrum Twente). Both types of collectors require < 10 mu L of test fluid. The collectors contain an integrated filter membrane, which prevents the transfer of blood cells into the microchip. The combination of such a sample collector with microchip CE allows point-of-care measurements {{without the need for}} off-chip sample treatment. This new on-chip protocol was verified against routine <b>lithium</b> <b>testing</b> of 5 patients in the hospital. Results: Sodium, lithium, magnesium, and calcium were separated in < 20 s.

The first transient scenario considered foresees that the target assembly, starting from the initial uniform temperature of 50 C, is heated up uniquely by convective heat transfer with lithium, flowing from inlet to outlet nozzle at its reference nominal temperature and pressure, until its nominal steady state thermal field distribution is reached. The second transient scenario foresees, more realistically, that the target assembly, starting from the uniform temperature of 50 C, is initially warmed-up by electric heaters mounted onto its main accessible surfaces and, subsequently, by convective heat transfer with lithium reference flow, until nominal steady state conditions are reached. Heaters have been supposed to operate in an on/off stepwise mode, resulting to be alternatively switched on and off in order to allow the target assembly thermal field to grow up minimizing thermal gradients. To this purpose, a parametric analysis has been performed to realistically assess, for each electric heater, its heat flux and duty-cycle.
