2500|$|By {{the early}} seventies, Bois {{had begun to}} {{incorporate}} quotations from earlier music, as in the Concerto pour Hrisanide (1971), or just generally familiar material, such as suddenly breaking into [...] "traditional" [...] melody-and-accompaniment figurations in Fusion pour deux (1971) and New Pieces for piano (1972).

This return to familiar material was seen {{on the one hand}} as the emergence of [...] "a more individual style" [...] , displaying [...] "a rare talent for musical comedy as well as a habit of boldly exploring the possibilities of avant-garde matter in a joyful manner" [...] On the other hand, particularly by American critics reviewing printed scores rather than performances, this was regarded as a [...] "haphazard and sketchy" [...] carelessness of vertical or <b>linear</b> <b>movement,</b> resulting in textures [...] "perforated by absentminded silences" [...] —an arbitrary and unjustified usage of clichés from the [...] "catalog of newly-invented and already-used-up effects" [...] in vogue at that time, as well as an indifference toward sonority, intensified by a [...] "gaucheness of the 'traditional' passages" [...]|$|E

50|$|Commonly {{constructed}} from {{materials such as}} aluminum, hardened cold rolled steel and galvanized steel, ball bearing slides consist of two linear rows of ball bearings contained by four rods and located on differing sides of the base, which support the carriage for smooth <b>linear</b> <b>movement</b> along the ball bearings. This low-friction <b>linear</b> <b>movement</b> can be powered by either a drive mechanism, inertia or by hand.

50|$|An early known {{example of}} rotary to {{reciprocating}} motion is the crank mechanism. The earliest hand-operated cranks appeared in China during the Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD).

40|$|Insulin stimulates glucose uptake into adipocytes by {{promoting}} the translocation of the glucose transporter isoform 4 (GLUT 4) from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane. In 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes GLUT 4 resides both in an endosomal pool, together with transferrin receptors, {{and in a}} unique pool termed 'GLUT 4 storage vesicles' (GSVs), which excludes endosomal proteins. The trafficking of GLUT 4 vesicles was studied in living 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes by time-lapse confocal microscopy of GLUT 4 tagged with green fluorescent protein. GLUT 4 vesicles exhibited two types of motion: rapid vibrations around a point and short (generally less than 10 microm) <b>linear</b> <b>movements.</b> The <b>linear</b> <b>movements</b> were completely blocked by incubation of the cells {{in the presence of}} microtubule-depolymerizing agents. This suggests that a subpopulation of GLUT 4 vesicles can exhibit motor-driven movements along microtubules. Upon further examination, microtubule depolymerization inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT 4 translocation to the plasma membrane by approx. 40 %, but had no effect on insulin-induced translocation of the transferrin receptor to the plasma membrane from endosomes. We propose that an intact microtubule cytoskeleton may be required for optimal trafficking of GLUT 4 present in the GSV pool, but not that resident in the endosomal pool...|$|R
40|$|A Stewart {{platform}} is a parallel manipulator robot that {{is able to}} perform three <b>linear</b> <b>movements,</b> lateral, longitudinal, and vertical, and three rotations, pitch, yaw, and roll. This paper reports a 30 [*]mm × 30 [*]mm × 34 [*]mm miniscale Stewart platform using TiNiCu shape-memory-alloy (SMA) actuators. The proposed Stewart platform possesses various advantages, such as large actuation force and high robustness with a simple mechanical structure. This Stewart platform uses four SMA actuators and four bias springs and performs a <b>linear</b> z-axis <b>movement</b> and tilting motions. The SMA actuators are activated by passing a current through the SMA wires using a heating circuit that generates a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal. This signal is varied to control {{the level of the}} displacement and tilting angle of the platform. The tilting direction depends on the SMA actuator that is activated, while all four SMA actuators are activated to achieve the <b>linear</b> z-axis <b>movement.</b> Each SMA actuator exerts a maximum force of 0. 6 [*]N at PWM duty cycle of 100 %. The fabricated miniature Stewart platform yields a full actuation of 12 [*]mm in the z-axis at 55 °C, with a maximum tilting angle of 30 ° in 4 [*]s...|$|R
