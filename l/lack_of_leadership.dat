5|$|The {{majority}} of food riots had ended by 1801, {{and there were}} certain political undertones to the actions, though <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> meant that little came of it. By the 1870s, 60% of Wales was owned by 570 families, most of whom did no farming. Instead, they employed workers, who were forced to vote Tory or lose their jobs.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{wrote that}} there had been a {{hardening}} of police attitudes, with officers believing that proportionality meant reciprocity. The deployment of officers in riot gear had become a routine response to lawful protest, largely the result of an ignorance of the law and a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> from the Home Office and police chiefs. Officers were being trained to use their riot shields as weapons. Police forces across the country differed in their training, the equipment they had access to, and their understanding of the law. The failure to understand the relevant legislation was in part due to its complexity, the report said, with 90 amendments to the Public Order Act passed since 1986.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{performed}} a few ceremonial functions {{for the remainder}} of Wilson's term, such as hosting foreign dignitaries. Among these was Albert I, King of the Belgians, the first European monarch to visit the United States. Edward, Prince of Wales, the future monarch of the United Kingdom, spent two days with Marshall and received a personal tour of Washington from him. First Lady Edith Wilson performed most routine duties of government by reviewing all of Wilson's communications and deciding what he would be presented with and what she would delegate to others. The resulting <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> allowed the administration's opponents to prevent ratification of the League of Nations treaty. They attacked the treaty's tenth article, which they believed would allow the United States to be bound in an alliance to European countries that could force the country return to war without an act of Congress. Marshall personally supported the treaty's adoption, but recommended several changes, including the requirement that all parties to it acknowledge the Monroe Doctrine and the United States' sphere of influence, and that the tenth article be made non-binding.|$|E
40|$|MM (P&DM) thesisThe study {{explores the}} land {{restitution}} and strategic leadership in Mpumalanga Province (MP).

Whereas the land had been return to their rightful owners <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>leadership</b> impedes any progress in the farms project. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate factors leading to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>leadership</b> in land restitution.

5|$|The {{difficulty}} {{of handling the}} divergent requirements was compounded when, in May 1963, shortly following on from the official issuing of Specification OR356/AW406, the option of having two distinct aircraft was rejected; the Secretary of State for Defence, Peter Thorneycroft, had insisted upon {{the development of a}} single common aircraft to meet the requirements of both services. According to Woods, Thorneycroft's decision had been influenced by the American General Dynamics F-111 multirole program, and had sought to duplicate this development concept for the P.1154. Despite a stated Navy preference for a swing-wing fighter, the services agreed that the aircraft would be completely common, with the exception of different radar systems. However, upon requests by various electronics manufacturers to the Ministry of Aviation to be issued with the requirements for the electronics fit, no response was ever issued; this <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> proved disruptive to the overall programme.|$|E

He made some excellent speeches but failed to persuade any of the major parties to support bills beneficial to Ireland, nothing worthwhile reaching the statute books.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Abraham Zaleznik {{distinguished}} {{leaders from}} managers. He described leaders as visionaries who inspire, while managers care about process. He {{claimed that the}} rise of managers was {{the main cause of}} the decline of American business in the 1970s and 1980s. <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> is most damaging at the level of strategic management where it can paralyze an entire organization.|$|E

The court martial of the survivors on 30 May 1814 attributed the loss to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership.</b> It acquitted all the survivors and commended the boatswain, James Flaxman, who had remained on deck though wounded and had attempted to rally the crew to Alacritys defence.|$|E

An IPCC spokesman expressed the view that Mr Geenty {{should not be allowed to}} retire until the investigation and any subsequent proceedings were completed.

25|$|Two {{days before}} the straw poll, the third {{official}} Republican debate was held at Iowa State University in Ames, sponsored by the Republican Party of Iowa, Fox News, and The Washington Examiner. Candidates participating in the debate included Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, Tim Pawlenty, Mitt Romney, Jon Huntsman and Rick Santorum. The debate was noted for the sparring between Bachmann and Pawlenty, with Pawlenty criticized Bachmann for {{what he said was}} a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership,</b> while Bachmann fired back that Pawlenty's support for cap and trade legislation and the individual mandate while governor of Minnesota made his record look like Obama's.|$|E
25|$|With the cliques united under Jimmy's rule, {{peace is}} {{restored}} to Bullworth and Jimmy, who now basks in his newfound glory, is well respected by everyone. Secretly, Gary convinces the cliques to pressure Jimmy to vandalize Bullworth's town hall, an event caught on camera {{by the local}} press. Shortly afterwards, Gary orchestrates a series of dangerous and destructive pranks throughout the school and blames them on Jimmy's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership.</b> These events ruin Jimmy's reputation {{in the eyes of}} the cliques, and he gradually loses their respect. The final straw comes when Gary falsely informs Crabblesnitch of Jimmy's alleged crimes, triggering immediate expulsion from Bullworth.|$|E

25|$|Strauß {{took the}} discord as a {{starting}} point to evaluate chances of expanding the CSU on the federal level, such as having separate electoral lists in the states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Hamburg, and Bremen. He hoped to draw away right-wing voters from the FDP towards the CSU and went as far as having private meetings with industrialists in North Rhine-Westphalia. These attempts led to discomfort within the membership base of the CDU and hampered both parties' chances in the upcoming elections. Kohl himself remained silent during these tensions, which some interpreted as a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership,</b> while others such as future president Karl Carstens praised him for seeking a consensus at the centre of the party.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, tens of {{thousands}} rose in the surrounding counties but the resulting rebellion was severely hampered by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> and was crushed with vicious brutality. The campaign met with little success except in Wexford where a number of massacres of loyalist civilians who were largely Protestant raised the spectre of sectarianism which was seized upon by enemies of the United Irishmen to weaken their non-sectarian appeal. The eventual arrival of 1,000 French troops in Killala, County Mayo in August was too little and too late to turn the tide for the United Irishmen. In October, Wolfe Tone himself was captured when a supporting French fleet of 3,000 troops was intercepted and defeated by the Royal Navy near Lough Swilly.|$|E
25|$|Gray's {{defenders}} {{would later}} argue that Gray simply practiced a management style {{that was different}} from that of Hoover. Gray's program of field office visits was something that Hoover had not done since his early years as director, and some felt Gray's visits did much to raise the morale of the agents working in those field offices. Furthermore, Gray's leadership style seemed to mirror what he had learned in the US Navy, in which the executive officer concentrates on the basic operation of the ship, while the captain concentrates on its position and heading. Felt believed Gray's methods were an unnecessary distraction and showed a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership.</b> He was sure he {{was not the only one}} of the FBI leaders who disapproved of Gray's methods, particularly among those who had served under Hoover.|$|E

25|$|Faltering narrative: Free {{movement}} of all EU citizens within the Schengen Area and the assurance {{of peace and}} stability were the two calling cards which endeared the European Union vision with electorates till the early 2000s. The European Union project was supposed to provide improvements in {{quality of life for}} citizens in all member States. However, the reality of everyday life in the post-enlargement European Union is one where the supranational federalist European project has failed to meet the aspirations of old and new members alike. Mounting public perception that strategic decisions taken in Brussels by both the EU institutions and NATO (Enlargement of the European Union & NATO into the Russian sphere of influence) are responsible for the many crisis that face Europe. European citizens cite the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> from top-level European politicians, widening inequalities, and the inability of the traditional political parties to renew themselves, in terms of both ideas and persons, as reasons driving them towards new political groupings. Unemployed youth and disenfranchised middle-income working-class populations are reshaping the European political spectrum through the ballot-box.|$|E
25|$|In September 1911, Vanagaitis started {{publishing}} journal Birutė which began {{using the term}} Lithuania Minor more often, competing with previous preferred term Prussian Lithuania. This reflected {{a shift in the}} understanding of the term Lithuania. The society early on adopted the green–white–red flag that was historically used in the region (its origins are unknown); the flag eventually became the flag of Lithuania Minor. While the society promoted events and symbols from the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (such as the struggles against the Teutonic Order during the Lithuanian Crusade or the image of Grand Duke Vytautas as the great leader), it remained politically loyal to the German Empire. Birutė provided the first alternative to the historical memory promoted by the German Empire or the Church. Prussian Lithuanians knew more about the House of Hohenzollern and Margraviate of Brandenburg than about the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was an early attempt at finding own distinctive history and identity, which was continued by other organizations. While Birutė was plagued by <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> and internal disagreements, its amateur concerts and theater performances sought to prove that the Lithuanian language was viable and equal to other languages.|$|E
