5|$|A 1999–2005 Australian police {{survey of}} detainees {{reported}} preliminary findings that self-reported users of benzodiazepines were less <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> non-user detainees to work full-time {{and more likely}} to receive government benefits, use methamphetamine or heroin, and be arrested or imprisoned. Benzodiazepines are sometimes used for criminal purposes; they serve to incapacitate a victim in cases of drug assisted rape or robbery.|$|E
5|$|Another source may be Aesop's Fables as {{published}} by William Caxton—scholar John MacQueen considers this more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> Disciplina clericalis—although the tale {{itself is not}} Aesopic but rather of the beast fable (also beast-epic) genre. The plots of such works are more complicated than their Aesopic counterpart, tend more towards ribaldry, and feature the fox making {{a victim of the}} wolf.|$|E
5|$|During January and February winter storms {{become more}} <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> {{they are in}} December. While they do not affect the entire U.S., the Northeast and Midwest are {{particularly}} prone to them, along with most neighboring areas of Canada. This includes many major metropolitan areas, and movie markets, in both countries.|$|E
50|$|The glass cliff is the {{phenomenon}} of women in leadership roles, such as executives {{in the corporate world}} and female political election candidates, being <b>likelier</b> <b>than</b> men to achieve leadership roles during periods of crisis or downturn, when the chance of failure is highest.|$|R

5|$|Further complicating {{this picture}} are {{repetition}} patterns. There {{are two types}} of repetition in Rapanui words: double syllables within roots, as in mamari, and grammatical reduplication of disyllables, as seen in rongorongo. In the Rapanui lexicon, double syllables as in mamari are 50% more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> chance can explain. However, in the rongorongo texts, analogous double AA glyphs are only 8% more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> chance. Similarly, in the Rapanui lexicon reduplicated disyllables such as rongorongo are seven times as common as chance, constituting a quarter of the vocabulary, whereas, in rongorongo texts, ABAB sequences are only twice as likely as chance, and 10% of the vocabulary. If rongorongo is a phonetic script, therefore, this discrepancy needs to be explained. Pozdniakov suggests that perhaps there was a 'reduplicator' glyph, or that modifications of glyphs, such as facing heads to the left rather than to the right, may have indicated repetition.|$|E
5|$|Narcosis {{is known}} to be {{additive}} to even minimal alcohol intoxication, and also to the effects of other drugs such as cannabis (which is more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> alcohol to have effects that last into a day of abstinence from use). Other sedative and analgesic drugs, such as opiate narcotics and benzodiazepines, add to narcosis.|$|E
5|$|Viruses (particularly rotavirus) and the {{bacteria}} Escherichia coli and Campylobacter species {{are the primary}} causes of gastroenteritis. There are, however, many other infectious agents that can cause this syndrome. Non-infectious causes are seen on occasion, but they are less <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> a viral or bacterial cause. Risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of immunity and relatively poor hygiene.|$|E
50|$|Haslam {{has said}} that women {{executives}} are <b>likelier</b> <b>than</b> men to accept glass cliff positions {{because they do not}} have access to the high-quality information and support that would ordinarily warn executives away. Utah State University professors Ali Cook and Christy Glass say women and other minorities view risky job offers as the only chance they are likely to get.|$|R
30|$|H 1. Remittance-recipients {{are less}} <b>likely</b> to vote <b>than</b> non-remittance recipients. However {{individuals}} who simultaneously receive remittances and CCT assistance are more <b>likely</b> to vote <b>than</b> {{those individuals who}} only receive international remittances.|$|R

5|$|Women {{were more}} likely to self-identify as being feminists than men in every country except Poland, where men (21%) were four points more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> women (17%) to agree very much with the statement. In South Korea, there was no {{difference}} between men and women (7%) on this measure.|$|E
5|$|A North–South divide {{remains in}} {{education}} at all levels. There {{is a significant}} attainment gap between Northern and Southern schools, even after controlling for the economic difference across the country, and pupils in the three Northern regions are less <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> the national average to achieve five higher-tier GCSEs. Northern students are under-represented at Oxbridge, where {{three times as many}} places go to Southerners as to Northerners, and other Southern universities while Southerners are under-represented at leading Northern universities such as Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much less <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E
30|$|Noteworthy, {{there is}} also a strong {{positive}} correlation between minority status and overeducation at the 14 years of schooling level. Blacks and Hispanics are 15.8 percentage points and 12.1 percentage points, respectively, <b>likelier</b> <b>than</b> whites to be overeducated among that group. Among college graduates and above, the relationship becomes insignificant, which is possibly a result of a strong selection into college based on unobservable skills that are negatively correlated with overeducation.|$|R
40|$|This study examines, simultaneously, {{the effects}} of {{internal}} and external scale economies upon export decisions. Combining previous results of exporting studies with the predictions of advances in trade theory and economic geography, this study finds that large firms are more <b>likely</b> to export <b>than</b> small firms, urban firms are more <b>likely</b> to export <b>than</b> rural firms, and firms in geographically concentrated industries are more <b>likely</b> to export <b>than</b> those in dispersed industries...|$|R
5000|$|Trans {{men have}} less success fitting in with and {{identifying}} with the gay male community because {{it tends to}} be more cisgender-focused and body-focused (especially in terms of being phallocentric); as a result, gay trans men are likelier to partner with each other than with a cisgender gay man. [...] There are, however, cases of women being <b>likelier</b> <b>than</b> men to thoroughly question trans men about their motivations for modifying their bodies.|$|R
5|$|At that time, {{the only}} Finnish heavy vehicle {{producer}} Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab (SAT) {{was building a}} new factory in Karis, a location considered less <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> Helsinki to come under attack from Soviet air raids. Company general director Tor Nessling suggested the factory should be larger than originally planned. As another option, Nessling, with extreme reservation, considered building a new factory elsewhere in Finland. SAT was experienced in heavy vehicle production but economic and technical resources were limited. Heavy vehicle importers and some political cliques thought SAT was trying {{to benefit from the}} war and to gain a dominant position in the Finnish market.|$|E
5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed {{of carbon dioxide and}} probably molecular oxygen. Investigation revealed that Callisto may possibly have a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths less than 300 kilometres. The likely presence of an ocean within Callisto indicates that it can or could harbour life. However, this is less <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> on nearby Europa. Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jupiter system since it is furthest from the intense radiation of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Children {{are less}} <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> adults {{to clear the}} infection. More than 95% of people who become {{infected}} as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection. This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{health risks}} of e-cigarettes are uncertain, {{but they are}} <b>likely</b> safer <b>than</b> tobacco cigarettes. Their {{long-term}} health effects are not known.|$|R
50|$|According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, working {{part-time}} {{is defined}} as working between 1 and 34 hours per week. In 2007, 18.3 million Americans worked part-time. Typically, part-time employees in the United States are not entitled to employee benefits, such as health insurance. The Institute for Women's Policy Research reports that females are nine times <b>likelier</b> <b>than</b> males {{to work in a}} part-time capacity over a full-time capacity as a result of caregiving demands of their family members.|$|R
50|$|A 2007 {{study found}} that female news {{consumers}} in the United Kingdom were <b>likelier</b> <b>than</b> male ones to accept that the glass cliff exists and is dangerous and unfair to women executives. Female study participants attributed {{the existence of the}} glass cliff to a lack of other opportunities for women executives, sexism, and men's in-group favoritism. Male study participants said that women are less suited than men to difficult leadership roles or strategic decision-making, or that the glass cliff is unrelated to gender.|$|R
5|$|Hull {{began the}} 2002–03 {{season with a}} number of defeats, which saw relegation look more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> promotion, and Mølby was sacked in October as Hull languished fifth from bottom in the league. Peter Taylor was named as Hull's new manager and in December 2002, just two months after his appointment, Hull {{relocated}} to the new 25,400-seater KC Stadium after 56years at Boothferry Park. At {{the end of the season}} Hull finished 13th.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities or during conversations with friends or family members, {{people are more likely}} to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses. In addition, women are more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{editions of}} the race have been decided with attacks on the Mur de Huy. The {{addition}} of the Côte de Cherave, however, added an unknown factor into the race: it was considered much more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> in previous years {{that a group of}} riders could break away from the peloton on the penultimate climb and hold an advantage to the finish line. No breakaway had won La Flèche Wallonne since 2003.|$|E
5000|$|Some shopkeepers {{practice}} {{racial profiling}} {{because they think}} it will increase their revenues ("revenue-based statistical discrimination"), for example by catering to discriminatory preferences of other customers by excluding black people. Other shopkeepers are trying to minimize costs ("cost-based statistical discrimination"). In these cases, researchers describe the cause of racial profiling as [...] "subconscious racism", with retailers making assumptions about their black clientele based on stereotypes that say blacks are <b>likelier</b> <b>than</b> others to commit crimes and to not be credit-worthy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Madame la Vicomtesse!" [...] {{said the}} old man. And, with the tact of his race, he bowed and retired. The Vicomtesse seated herself {{on one of the}} rude chairs, and looked at Nick curiously. There {{was no such thing as}} embarrassment in her manner, no trace of misgiving that she would not move {{properly}} in the affair. Knowing Nick as I did, the difficulty of the task appalled me, for no man was <b>likelier</b> <b>than</b> he to fly off at a misplaced word.|$|R
50|$|NASA's study {{concluded}} that debris accounted for half of the overall risk to the Shuttle. Executive-level decision to proceed was required if catastrophic impact was <b>likelier</b> <b>than</b> 1 in 200. On a normal (low-orbit) mission to the ISS the risk was c. 1 in 300, but STS-125 (the Hubble repair mission) at 350 mi was initially calculated at a 1-in-185 risk (due to the 2009 satellite collision). A re-analysis with better debris numbers reduced the estimated risk to 1 in 221, and the mission went ahead.|$|R
5|$|Teleosts may spawn in {{the water}} column or, more commonly, on the substrate. Water column spawners are mostly limited to coral reefs; the fish will rush towards the surface and release their gametes. This appears to protect the eggs from some predators and allow them to {{disperse}} widely via currents. They receive no parental care. Water column spawners are more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> substrate spawners to spawn in groups. Substrate spawning commonly occurs in nests, rock crevices or even burrows. Some eggs can stick to various surfaces like rocks, plants, wood or shells.|$|E
5|$|The 19th-century Louisiana {{historian}} Charles Gayarré also embellished {{the story}} of a conspiracy behind the Natchez revolt, composing in his book a lengthy speech by the Great Sun in which the leader exhorted his warriors to invite the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Yazoo to join in the attack on the French. In his 2008 book on the Natchez revolt, Arnaud Balvay wrote that more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> not, the conspiracy claim was false because of incoherence in primary sources.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 IPCC report noted many {{observed}} {{changes in}} the climate, including atmospheric composition, global average temperatures, ocean conditions, and others. The report concluded the observed increase in tropical cyclone intensity is larger than climate models predict. In addition, the report considered that {{it is likely that}} storm intensity will continue to increase through the 21st century, and declared it more <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> not that there has been some human contribution to the increases in tropical cyclone intensity.|$|E
