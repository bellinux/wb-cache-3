However, the accuracy of qRT-PCR analysis strongly depends on transcript normalization using stably expressed reference genes. The aim {{of this study was to}} find internal reference genes for qRT-PCR analysis in various experimental conditions for seed, adventitious underground bud, and other organs of leafy spurge. Eleven candidate reference genes (BAM 4, PU 1, TRP-like, FRO 1, ORE 9, BAM 1, SEU, ARF 2, KAPP, ZTL, and MPK 4) were selected from among 171 genes based on expression stabilities during seed germination and bud growth. The other ten candidate reference genes were selected from three different sources: (1) 3 stably expressed <b>leafy</b> spurge <b>genes</b> (60 S, bZIP 21, and MD- 100) identified from the analyses of leafy spurge microarray data; (2) 3 orthologs of Arabidopsis "general purpose" traditional reference genes (GAPDH_ 1, GAPDH_ 2, and UBC); and (3) 4 orthologs of Arabidopsis stably expressed genes (UBC 9, SAND, PTB, and F-box) identified from Affymetrix ATH 1 whole-genome GeneChip studies. The expression stabilities of these 21 genes were ranked based on the C(T) values of 72 samples using four different computation programs including geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and the comparative ΔC(T) method. Our analyses revealed SAND, PTB, ORE 9, and ARF 2 to be the most appropriate reference genes for accurate normalization of gene expression data. Since SAND and PTB were obtained from 4 orthologs of Arabidopsis, while ORE 9 and ARF 2 were selected from 171 <b>leafy</b> spurge <b>genes,</b> it was more efficient to identify good reference genes from the orthologs of other plant species that were known to be stably expressed than that of randomly testing endogenous genes.

Although these two copies are very similar, they can be distinguished easily due to a specific ca. 47 bp segment that is missing in the “short sequence” copy. The “long sequence” copy performed well in phylogenetic analysis of Cinnamomum and is largely consistent with phylogenetic relationships based on ITS region sequences. In contrast, the “short sequence” copy was problematic for phylogenetic reconstruction and PCR-mediated recombination was detected in 20 of the 38 Cinnamomum species with two LEAFY copies. Thirty-one recombinants were discriminated and the breakpoints suggested by the programs RDP 3 and GARD were distributed randomly along the recombination sequences.

40|$|Abstract. —Most {{implementations}} {{of molecular}} clocks require resolved topologies. However, {{one of the}} Bayesian relaxed clock approaches accepts input topologies that include polytomies. We explored the effects of resolved and polytomous input topologies in a rate-heterogeneous sequence data set for Gnetum, {{a member of the}} seed plant lineage Gnetales. Gnetum has 10 species in South America, 1 in tropical West Africa, and 20 to 25 in tropical Asia, and explanations for the ages of these disjunctions involve long-distance dispersal and/or the breakup of Gondwana. To resolve relationships within Gnetum, we sequenced most of its species for six loci from the chloroplast (rbcL, matK, and the trnT-trnF region), the nucleus (rITS/ 5. 8 S and the <b>LEAFY</b> <b>gene</b> second intron), and the mitochondrion (nad 1 gene second intron). Because Gnetum has no fossil record, we relied on fossils from other Gnetales and from the seed plant lineages conifers, Ginkgo, cycads, and angiosperms to constrain a molecular clock and obtain absolute times for within-Gnetum divergence events. Relationships among Gnetales and the other seed plant lineages are still unresolved, and we therefore used differently resolved topologies, including one that contained a basal polytomy among gymnosperms. For a small set of Gnetales exemplars (n = 13) in which rbcL and matK satisfied the clock assumption, we also obtained time estimates from a strict clock, calibrated with one outgroup fossil.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this project was to develop and {{validate}} sterility systems in poplar with {{the ultimate goal of}} fulfilling the basic requirements for commercial use. For this, sterility must be complete and stable over multiple growing seasons, cause no detrimental effects on vegetative growth, and successful transformation events must be identifiable via molecular tests when trees are still juvenile. Because of the inherent difficulties in achieving and demonstrating complete sterility in trees, our approach was to study alternate sterility systems in Arabidopsis and/or early-flowering tree systems. The public benefit from this work is the capacity for containment of genes or exotic forms of trees so they can be of benefit for industry for production of wood, energy, and renewable products, while having minimal impact on wild populations of trees. We tested three methods for engineering sterility: dominant negative mutant (DNM) proteins, floral tissue ablation, and RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress the expression of several floral regulatory genes. The ultimate {{goal of this}} work was to produce a number of transgenic poplars that could be outplanted to enable future assessments of the effectiveness of these transgenic sterility methods. Our attempts to produce ablation constructs that did not interfere with tree health were partially successful. Using the poplar <b>LEAFY</b> <b>gene</b> promoter and the barnase/barstar system, we were able to regenerate plants that grew well in the greenhouse, but they showed poor health in the field. Four of seven DNM genes tested were considered promising enough, based on results in Arabidopsis, to produce transgenic poplars. Single, double, and triple RNAi genes were produced and transformed into poplar. Over all, we produced 1, 964 PCR-confirmed transgenic events with 19 different kinds of sterility genes and several kinds of control genes.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 To {{reduce the}} {{environmental}} impacts caused by gene flow from transgenic trees, reproductive sterility genes have been developed that use a floral regulatory element linked to a cell toxin. This results in dysfunction or ablation of floral tissues, causing sterility. However, floral promoters often permit low levels of expression in vegetative tissues, which can impair plant health. We therefore developed an attenuation system to avoid the deleterious effects from unintended cytotoxin gene expression in vegetative tissues, and tested it in transgenic poplars. We used the promoter from the poplar ortholog of LEAFY (PTLF) to drive the barnase (ribonuclease) cytotoxin, and three heterologous promoters to drive the attenutation transgene, barstar. Barstar is a specific 1 : 1 inhibitor of barnase, and thus should protect vegetative tissues from low levels of barnase expression. The <b>LEAFY</b> <b>gene</b> was chosen {{is known to be}} an effective floral ablation agent, however, it also shows expression in vegetative tissues. The heterologous promoters included the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 S basal promoter + 5 to - 72 fragment (35 SBP), the CaMV 35 S basal promoter fused to the 68 bp TMV omega element (35 SBP omega), and the nopline synthase (NOS) promoter. We first studied the expression properties of the promoters by evaluating promoter::GUS gene fusions in transgenic poplar (Populus tremula x alba) via fluorometric GUS assays. In leaves, the NOS promoter imparted the highest expression with a mean expression level five-fold higher than PTLF, and 9 - and 14 -fold higher than 35 SBP omega and 35 SBP, respectively. Only the NOS and PTLF promoter showed tissue-specific expression patterns with respect to shoots, leaves, stems, and roots. The NOS promoter exhibited the strongest expression in roots. The PTLF promoter specified highest expression in shoot tips. Directed by the poplar floral promoter PTLF, the barnase gene was assembled into constructs harboring barstar driven by either 35 SBP, 355 BP omega, or NOS. All constructs also contained flanking matrix-attachment regions (rb 7) from tobacco to increase and stabilize transgene expression. An unattenuated PTLF::barnase construct (lacking barstar) failed to give rise to any transgenic plants, whereas the attenuated constructs had transformation efficiencies above four percent. However, their transformation rates were still significantly below that of constructs lacking barnase, which averaged 6. 1...|$|E

We present evidence that AGL 24 is an early target of transcriptional repression by LFY and AP 1. Without such repression, continued AGL 24 expression in floral meristems is sufficient to cause floral reversion regardless of the activation of floral organ identity genes.

Site-directed mutagenesis of Ee;CDKF; 1 indicated that two threonine residues (Thr 291 and Thr 296) were mutually responsible for intra-molecular autophosphorylation and for phosphorylating its substrate protein, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). Polyclonal antibodies generated against the Ee;CDKF; 1 protein or against a phosphorylated Ee;CDKF; 1 peptide [NERYGSL(pT) SC] were used to examine abundance and phosphorylation of CDKF; 1 during seed germination and bud growth. The levels of CDKF; 1 were lower in dry or imbibed seeds than in germinating seeds or seedlings. Differences in CDKF; 1 were also observed during adventitious bud development; small buds appeared to have greater levels of CDKF; 1 than large buds. Similar patterns of CDKF; 1 expression were detected with either the polyclonal antibody developed using the CDKF; 1 protein or the phosphorylated peptide.

By conducting functional analyses for orthologs of the flower meristem identity <b>genes</b> <b>LEAFY</b> (LFY) and UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO) in Gerbera hybrida, we show that GhUFO is the master regulator of flower meristem identity, while GhLFY has evolved a novel, homeotic function during the evolution of head-like inflorescences. Resembling LFY expression in a single flower meristem, uniform expression of GhLFY in the inflorescence meristem defines the capitulum as a determinate structure that can assume floral fate upon ectopic GhUFO expression. We also show that GhLFY uniquely regulates the ontogeny of outer, expanded ray flowers but not inner, compact disc flowers, indicating that the distinction of different flower types in Asteraceae is connected with their independent evolutionary origins from separate branching systems...|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to vegetative apical meristems and some exflorescence meristems, floral meristems cannot {{continue to grow}} indefinitely. Their future growth {{is limited to the}} flower with a particular size and form. The transition from shoot meristem to floral meristem requires floral meristem identity genes, that both specify the floral organs and cause the termination of the production of stem cells. AGAMOUS (AG) is a floral homeotic gene required for floral meristem termination and necessary for proper development of the stamens and carpels. AG is necessary to prevent the conversion of floral meristems to inflorescence shoot meristems, but is not involved in the transition from shoot to floral meristem. AG is turned on by the floral meristem identity <b>gene</b> <b>LEAFY</b> (LFY) and WUS and is restricted to the centre of the floral meristem or the inner two whorls. This way floral identity and region specificity is achieved. WUS activates AG by binding to a consensus sequence in the AG’s second intron and LFY binds to adjacent recognition sites. Once AG is activated it represses expression of WUS leading to the termination of the meristem.|$|R
40|$|Tomato is an {{important}} crop and hence {{there is a great}} interest in understanding the genetic basis of its flowering. Several genes have been identified by mutations and we constructed a set of novel double mutants to understand how these genes interact to shape the inflorescence. It was previously suggested that the branching of the tomato inflorescence depends on the gradual transition from inflorescence meristem (IM) to flower meristem (FM) : the extension of this time window allows IM to branch, as seen in the compound inflorescence (s) and falsiflora (fa) mutants that are impaired in FM maturation. We report here that JOINTLESS (J), which encodes a MADS-box protein of the same clade than SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) and AGAMOUS LIKE 24 (AGL 24) in Arabidopsis, interferes with this timing and delays FM maturation, therefore promoting IM fate. This was inferred from the fact that j mutation suppresses the high branching inflorescence phenotype of s and fa mutants and was further supported by the expression pattern of J, which is expressed more strongly in IM than in FM. Most interestingly, FA - the orthologue of the Arabidopsis <b>LEAFY</b> (LFY) <b>gene</b> - shows the complementary expression pattern and is more active in FM than in IM. Loss of J function causes premature termination of flower formation in the inflorescence and its reversion to a vegetative program. This phenotype is enhanced in the absence of systemic florigenic protein, encoded by the SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT) gene, the tomato orthologue of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). These results suggest that the formation of an inflorescence in tomato requires the interaction of J and a target of SFT in the meristem, for repressing FA activity and FM fate in the IM...|$|R
40|$|Flower {{initiation}} in Arabidopsis thaliana under noninductive short-day {{conditions is}} dependent on the biosynthesis of the plant hormone gibberellin (GA). This dependency can be explained, at least partly, by GA regulation of the flower meristem identity <b>gene</b> <b>LEAFY</b> (LFY) and the flowering time gene SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS 1. Although it is well established that GA 4 is the active GA in the regulation of Arabidopsis shoot elongation, the identity of the GA responsible for the regulation of Arabidopsis flowering has not been established. Through a combination of GA quantifications and sensitivity assays, we show that GA 4 is the active GA in the regulation of LFY transcription and Arabidopsis flowering time under short-day conditions. The levels of GA 4 and sucrose increase dramatically in the shoot apex shortly before floral initiation, and the regulation of genes involved in GA metabolism suggests that this increase is possibly due to transport of GAs and sucrose from outside sources to the shoot apex. Our results demonstrate that in the dicot Arabidopsis, in contrast with the monocot Lolium temulentum, GA 4 is the active GA in the regulation of both shoot elongation and flower initiation...|$|R
40|$|During {{the course}} of flower development, floral {{homeotic}} genes are expressed in defined concentric regions of floral meristems called whorls. The SUPERMAN (SUP, also called FLO 10) gene, which encodes a C 2 H 2 -type zinc finger protein, is involved in maintenance of the stamen/carpel whorl boundary (the boundary between whorl 3 and whorl 4) in Arabidopsis. Here, we show that the regulation of SUP expression in floral meristems is complex, consisting of two distinct phases, initiation and maintenance. The floral meristem identity <b>gene</b> <b>LEAFY</b> (LFY) {{plays a role in}} the initiation phase through at least two pathways, which differ from each other in the involvement of two homeotic genes, APETALA 3 (AP 3) and PISTILLATA (PI). AP 3, PI, and another homeotic gene, AGAMOUS (AG), are further required for SUP expression in the later maintenance phase. Aside from these genes, there are other as yet unidentified genes that control both the temporal and spatial patterns of SUP expression in whorl 3 floral meristems. SUP appears to act transiently, probably functioning to trigger a genetic circuit that creates the correct position of the whorl 3 /whorl 4 boundary...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) differs significantly from annuals species in having distinct juvenile and adult periods. Although intimately {{linked to the}} transition {{from one to the}} other, flowering per se takes 2 years in adult plants. Using grapevine cv. Riesling orthologues of the Arabidopsis flowering <b>genes</b> <b>LEAFY,</b> APETALA 1, AGAMOUS, TERMINAL FLOWER 1 and SEPALLATA 3, we came up with a comprehensive temporal and spatial molecular analysis of the flowering in this species. Expression of VvLEAFY and VvTFL 1 is detected early after germination in the shoot apical meristem of seedlings and later in the latent buds of juvenile plants, however, it is not sufficient to induce flowering which only occurs after 3 – 6 years of vegetative development. On adult plants, the latent buds are set the first season but remain apparently dormant in winter. Expression analysis in established vineyards provides molecular evidence for continuous gene expression of VvLEAFY over two growing seasons even at mean temperatures below− 10 ◦C. On the following spring, only latent buds that develop into flower-bearing shoots show expression of VvTFL 1, VvLEAFY, VvAP 1, VvAG and VvSEP 3 suggesting that their expression is required for flower ontogenesis...|$|R
