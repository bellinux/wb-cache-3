5|$|In July 1216, {{the newly}} elected Pope Honorius III once again called upon Andrew to fulfill his father's vow to lead a crusade. Andrew, who had {{postponed}} the crusade at <b>least</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> (in 1201, 1209 and 1213), finally agreed. Steven Runciman, Tibor Almási and other modern historians say that Andrew hoped that his decision would increase his likelihood of being elected as Latin Emperor of Constantinople, because his wife's uncle, Emperor Henry, had died in June. According to a letter written by Pope Honorius in 1217, envoys from the Latin Empire had actually informed Andrew that they planned to elect either him or his father-in-law, Peter of Courtenay, as emperor. The barons of the Latin Empire elected Peter of Courtenay {{in the summer of}} 1216.|$|E

5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at <b>least</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E

30|$|This {{dynamical}} {{systems approach}} pioneered by Rinzel and Ermentrout {{is also used}} to explain more complicated neural activity such as bursting patterns. Here, the inherent multiple time-scale structure of neural models given through inherent slow and fast cell membrane processes is actively used to explain the bursting pattern. The bifurcation structure found in the fast subsystem provides a possible key to understanding the genesis of bursting patterns; see, e.g., [5]. Interestingly enough, the spiking pattern itself within a burst is also often a result of a multiple time-scale structure. This relaxation type behaviour is typically ignored in the bursting literature, because it would mean to consider models with (at <b>least)</b> <b>three</b> <b>time</b> scales—fast, intermediate and slow—which has become only recently a new research focus [26 – 28].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{consider}} identification and estimation of average marginal effects in a correlated random coefficients model without imposing strong functional form assumptions on the structural likelihood or the mixing distribution. Identification is achieved through imposing that the mixing distribution depends on observed covariates only through an index function and {{the assumption that}} at <b>least</b> <b>three</b> <b>time</b> periods are available for each cross sectional unit. We leave the functional form of the index function unrestricted subject to smoothness conditions. We present identification results for this model and consider estimation of the marginal effects of interest.
