40|$|Religion {{has long}} been {{acknowledged}} as an important social force that influences human behavior but yet in the secular society its influence on consumer behavior appears to be underestimated. Of the sporadic research conducted, findings indicated that religion can be {{a significant factor in}} relation to consumption patterns, innovativeness, media usage, family decision-making, purchase risk aversion and selected store patronage behavior. The current research is exploratory in nature and attempts to investigate the influence of religiosity on attitudes <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> products especially among young Malaysian consumers. Religiosity, the independent variable, was measured by the intrinsic/ extrinsic religious orientation scale adopted from Allport and Ross (1967). The dependent variable was derived from a study on attitudes <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> product (Mostafa, 2007). The questionnaires were distributed to students in a large private university located in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Reliability analysis and multiple linear regressions were conducted. The results from the multiple linear regression analysis indicate that intrinsic religiosity has a significant relationship on consumer’s attitude <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> product. However, in the case of extrinsic religiosity, there is no significant relationship on consumer’s attitude <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> product...|$|R

Through a hierarchical values-attitudes model, the paper examines {{the degree to}} which attitudes <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> food is determined by consumers’ values and their general attitudes towards environment and nature and technological progress. The link between collectivism, attitudes towards environment and nature, and attitudes <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> food is the strongest link of the hierarchical model. However, collectivism also influences attitudes towards technological progress, which in turn influence attitudes <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> food. This finding, coupled with the lack of significant relationship between individualism and attitudes towards technological progress point towards the conclusion that the belief of Chinese people that technology is a positive determinant of food safety and environmental friendliness in food production steams from altruistic predispositions, which in turn influence (positively) Chinese consumers’ attitudes towards technology.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} consumers’ {{willingness}} to pay for renewable electricity. Green electricity consumption induced by improved information on electricity sources appears as an additional alternative to renewable energy support policies in practice today. It is believed that a shift of the demand <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> sources can stimulate renewable generation and {{have a positive impact}} on the environment. However, this voluntary initiative will only work if it is perceived worth paying a premium for green electricity. This work aims to examine the drivers of consumers’ behaviour <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> electricity and to develop economic models that embrace these findings. The analysis also elucidates how the demand for renewable electricity is affected by market prices and by consumers’ income and how information and advertising campaigns can stimulate the behaviour <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> electricity so that the voluntary demand system can fully achieve its goals...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{relationship}} of environmental concern of consumers with their attitude <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> products and also to identify the predictors of environmental concern. The data was generated from a researcher controlled sample of graduate and post-graduate students enrolled in educational institutions located in the national capital of India (New Delhi) and surrounding areas popularly known as National Capital Region (NCR). The data generated was analysed employing Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The study findings indicate that environmental concern has a significant and positive influence on attitude <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> products. Collectivism and eco-literacy emerged as predictors of the environmental concern of consumers. The findings of this study are expected to enhance the understanding of marketers of the role played by variables such as religiosity, collectivism, eco-literacy, and environmental concern in formation of attitude of consumers <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> products...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a study {{undertaken}} to {{determine the influence of}} conative attitudes <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> advertising on black Generation Y students’ environmental behaviour in the South African context. In South Africa, the Generation Y cohort, which is defined as including individuals born between 1986 and 2005, accounted for 40 percent of the country’s population in 2011. The African portion of this cohort (hereafter referred to as black Generation Y) comprise an estimated 84 percent of this cohort. This translates into black Generation Y individuals being a market force of significant importance to marketers, including those engaged in green advertising efforts. Despite the importance of this market segment, their consumer behaviour remains under researched in general, specifically concerning their attitudes towards environmental issues and marketing. In order to address this shortfall in the literature, a structured, self-administered questionnaire was used to gather data on conative attitudes <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> advertising and how this influences environmental behaviour from a sample of 400 black Generation Y students across four South African public registered higher education institutions’ campuses situated in the Gauteng province. Data analysis included measurement of model fit, independent z-tests and path analysis using structural equation modelling. According to the results, there was acceptable fit between the proposed two-dimensional model for measuring conative attitudes <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> advertising and the data in the sample. The findings suggest that in South Africa, black Generation Y students’ conative attitudes <b>towards</b> <b>green</b> advertising have a significant positive influence on their environmental behaviour.
