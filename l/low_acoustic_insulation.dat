40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a methodology that {{makes use of}} laser Doppler vibrometry to assess the <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> performance of a building element. The sound power radated by {{the surface of the}} element is numerically determined from the vibrational pattern, offering an alternative for classical microphone measurements. Compared to the latter the proposed analysis is not sensitive to room acoustical effects. This allows the proposed methodology to be used at low frequencies, where the standardized microphone based approach suffers from a high uncertainty due to a <b>low</b> <b>acoustic</b> modal density. Standardized measurements as well as laser Doppler vibrometry measurements and computations have been performed on two test panels, a light-weight wall and a gypsum block wall and are compared and discussed in this paper. The proposed methodology offers an adequate solution for the assessment of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> of building elements at low frequencies. This is crucial in the framework of recent proposals of acoustic standards for measurement approaches and single number sound insulation performance ratings to take into account frequencies down to 50 Hz. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} of <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> behaviour of hybrid sandwich composite panels for application in modular house construction. These sandwich panels are a sustainable, light-weight and durable solution, since are based on natural fibers structure impregnated with a thermosetting polymer. In this way, three different types of hybrid composite panels containing polyurethane core and laminated composite skins were produced and analyzed, varying the composition of laminates. The composite laminates of the prototypes were produced using a vacuum infusion technique and were composed of glass and jute fibers, impregnated with a polyester resin. The solutions developed were compared with a standard, composed of plasterboards having different thicknesses and used for thermal and <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation.</b> <b>Acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> characterization was performed on specimens with 220 x 220 mm size in a sound proof acoustic chamber. The tested sandwich panels showed promising results; however, their overall performance was lower {{as compared to the}} performance of standard solutions used for comparison. Nevertheless, the specific <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> performance, i. e. sound reduction per unit mass of material for the developed sandwich panels was significantly higher as compared to the standard materials, indicating better suitability of this innovative solution for light-weight construction and modular housing.

So far, some of its assessed material properties (e. g. density, fire resistance, durability, thermal conductivity, compression and bending strengths, and impact resistance) suggest adequacy of this product for several building applications, such as a thermal insulation product, a light weight partition wall, a ceiling coating, or as indoor doors, among other possibilities. However, proper <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> performance is also a fundamental property required {{for most of the}} above identified building applications. Therefore, this paper is focused on evaluating the impact sound insulation potential of the proposed particleboard. At this stage, impact sound insulation tests have been performed in which the <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> gain of a pavement reinforced acoustically by a 3 cm thick corn cob particleboard was assessed. The obtained <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulation</b> gain was then compared with the respective ones of traditional sound insulation products (e. g. glass wool and expanded polystyrene) and also with different alternative natural sound insulation products (e. g. kenaf, coco fibre, sheep wool, cork and cellulose).

This conclusion is even more interesting taking into account that corn cob is a natural, organic, renewable and local raw building material...|$|R
