25|$|Closer to {{the moment}} of the attack, the attacking planes were {{detected}} and tracked as they approached by an Army radar installation being operated that morning as a mostly unofficial training exercise. The Opana Point radar station, operated by two enlisted men (Pvts. Lockard and Elliot) plotted the approaching force, and their relief team plotted them returning to the carriers. Elliott called in the reading to the information center. The call was received by Pvt. Joseph McDonald. McDonald found Lt Kermit A. Tyler, the officer in charge at the barely operational warning information center at Pearl Harbor. He informed Tyler a large number of planes were coming in from the north and he had never received a call <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before.</b> Tyler told McDonald it was nothing.|$|E

[...] Rihanna elaborated on the concept of the video: [...] "We've never done a video <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before.</b> This is probably one of the deepest videos I've ever done... it's all about love and love being like a drug, you definitely get that from this."

500|$|Burt's {{defense of}} Kurt from a slur by Finn in [...] "Theatricality" [...] was called [...] "one of the {{heaviest}} scenes Glee has ever delved into" [...] by Eric Goldman of IGN. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly called the scene [...] "utterly heartbreaking and lovely". He added, [...] "it {{was an amazing}} moment for Glee, capped off by the simple gesture of Burt grabbing his son's shoulder {{in an act of}} support. Mike O'Malley is completely Emmy-worthy. We've never seen a character <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> on television or seen such a relationship between a father and son." [...] Poniewozik wrote, [...] "Mike O'Malley, as always, made me believe that Burt was not speaking out of some false enlightenment but out of a desire to protect his family and a struggle to do the right thing." [...] BuddyTV's Henrik Batallones said O'Malley was [...] "the star of the show".|$|E

Official figures gave the episode ratings of 8.86million for its original airing and 740,000 for its 10pm repeat on BBC Three. Brown's performance in the episode was praised by Robert Hanks of The Independent who wrote: [...] "I don't ever remember hearing anybody on a soap talk <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before.</b> I mean, like a real person, with real feelings, such as self-pity and a desperate urge for self-preservation. Brown conveyed the seedy gloom of it all beautifully, as well." [...] Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian deemed Brown possibly {{the only member of}} the cast, with the exception of Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell), capable of carrying such a monologue, opining that she [...] "carried it off magnificently". She took issue with Dot's characterisation, however, believing that Dot is presented as the serial's [...] "moral compass", and would not leave her husband in a nursing home.|$|E

But this was much-loved character overkill." [...] He deemed Dot a [...] "soap icon", however he also assessed that: ...|$|E

500|$|... "Till the World Ends" [...] is an uptempo dance-pop and electropop song, with an electro {{beat and}} {{elements}} of trance and Eurodance. The song opens with sirens and a [...] "sizzling" [...] bassline.

[...] In the chorus, the song slows down while Spears sings [...] "I can't take it take it take no more / Never felt like felt <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> / Come on get me get me on the floor / DJ what you what you waiting for?".

Vitali had previously worked with Robyn on the music videos for [...] "Hang with Me" [...] and [...] "Dancing on My Own". For the video, Australian artist Lucy McRae, who makes [...] "body architecture", designed a special [...] "tube dress" [...] for Robyn to wear. McRae also designed the outfits Robyn wore on the Body Talk album covers. The dress for the video {{was made up of}} plastic pipes that were periodically filled with colored fluids and wrapped around Robyn's body. Robyn recalled that the machine that kept the liquid flowing was [...] "very complicated". It was powered by drills and required [...] "a whole lot of complex machinery to function". The machine was built by McRae, who had to do it quickly because of the video's budget. McRae said, [...] "Me and the dream team had never done anything <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>before,</b> the whole project was happening for the first time. The machine was super loud." [...] The shooting stopped four times due to leaks, and the team had to mop and re-set the technology. The shooting took twenty hours, and by 3 a.m. McRae said that Robyn was wrapped [...] "in a kilometre of tubing draped over her head and body". She praised Robyn's stamina throughout the shoot, saying that [...] "there were chaotic moments that could have been potentially disastrous and the entire time Robyn was working with us, smiling, moving when the tubes were stuck and just super happy we were making it happen." ...|$|E
