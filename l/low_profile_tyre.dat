5000|$|The clutch {{was criticized}} for being too heavy and the gear change {{affected}} by over-spring towards {{the third and fourth}} positions. Power steering was standard on the two-litre model in the UK. The design was praised for its unobtrusiveness, correct ratio and the accuracy of its action. The caveat was that [...] "as usual though there is little feedback from the front tyres as the nose of the car nudges wide of the line on fast corners". About the tyres the comment was that [...] "Lancia's engineers have honed the Trevi's handling so finely that only one make of tyre is approved, Pirelli's P6. It's a <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> <b>tyre</b> that gives a very high standard of grip in all weathers, and contributes to the well-balanced 'feel' of the car during rapid cornering." [...] In the summary the steering was viewed as being much better than the regular Beta's.|$|E
50|$|Four {{specification}} {{levels of}} the R31 Pintara were offered: GLi, Executive, GX, and GXE. A TRX bodykit package was offered for the GX and GXE sedans, featuring a front and rear air dam, rear spoiler, side skirts, grille cover, alloy wheels and <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> <b>tyres.</b> Unlike the later U12 TRX, this did not feature any mechanical upgrades.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, Greater Manchester PTE {{realised}} its nine-year-old Seddon Pennine midibuses in {{use on the}} Manchester shuttle between Piccadilly and Victoria {{stations were}} {{nearing the end of}} their useful lives. Nothing was at that time readily available that would meet the PTE's requirements and Dennis was requested to provide a solution. This used a very-short-wheelbase version of the Dominator frame, with the optional air-over leaf suspension to axles with 16-inch wheels and <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> <b>tyres,</b> overall body length was 7.6m and width 2.3m.|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1968 the new <b>tyre</b> {{technology}} was <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> <b>tyres.</b> Pirelli were hot on the tail with their new CN36 which came out in 1969. The CN36 had a striking tread pattern and was a favourite {{for the likes of}} the Porsche 911, Ford Escort & Ford Cortina. 1971 would see Pirelli’s introduction of another high speed (HS) tyre with their CN12 Cinturato HS. These tyres were rated to be able to withstand the exceptional power of the Lamborghini Muira SV, and today their 205/70VR15 Pirelli Cinturato tyre holds a W speed rating (170mph).|$|R
50|$|Available {{with the}} 1093 cc engine the Coupé {{featured}} additions such as sporting seats trim, wheel arch extensions, rear spoiler, <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> <b>tyres</b> and a rev counter, {{as well as}} the round headlights which were later fitted across the range. The GL featured a 60 PS (44 kW) engine. In 1985, the first sporty Polo, the Coupé GT, was introduced with a 75 PS (55 kW) engine, as well as servo assisted brakes, twin headlights, a digital clock, sports seats and a rev counter. Other special feature models were introduced over the rest of the period of the Mark 2 production run including models such as the Twist, Parade and Country.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the mid-1970s}} ideas were {{compiled}} on a second-generation standard bus with the floor height reduced {{to allow for}} access with just one step. Initially one would achieve that with <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> <b>tyres</b> at 55 percent but in a prototype run (funded by the ministry of research) in 1976 {{it proved to be}} a bad choice, so later prototypes settled on 70 percent with two steps. The Hamburg transport authority had to order 22 prototypes of the [...] "S 80" [...] series (named standard bus for the 1980s) to refine the concept. The models were tested for two years by 8 different transport companies in Germany until the second generation standard bus was settled.|$|R
50|$|The {{stronger}} {{tubular steel}} chassis was mounted on wide 17 in FPS front wheels, 18s in the back, with <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> radial <b>tyres.</b> The rear suspension was a Bilstein shock absorber {{acting on a}} single-sided Paralever swingarm, which pushed the wheelbase out to 1565 mm. On the front were twin 41.7 mm Marzocchi forks. The brakes were four-pot Brembo over two-pot on the K100, {{with a pair of}} 305 mm drilled discs. An Anti-lock braking system was optional in all markets except North America, where it was standard.|$|R
5000|$|In New Zealand, {{where the}} M3 was never officially sold, the local {{importer}} created a sporting {{version of the}} sedan called M325i. About 100 such cars were imported beginning in late 1986 until at least 1990. Fitted with the standard non-catalyzed [...] 2.5 litre engine they benefitted from a Motorsport fettled suspension, the M-Technic body package, 15-inch BBS cross-spoke wheels with wide, <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> (225/50) <b>tyres,</b> and a limited-slip differential. The M325i is quite similar to the British market 325i Sport, also developed {{as a response to}} the absence of a right-hand-drive M3.|$|R
5000|$|The fifth {{generation}} has received generally positive reviews. Nevertheless, {{some critics have}} complained that the car {{lost some of its}} distinctive European character with the redesign. Most reviewers found the ride to be firm and well controlled, but not always as forgiving as the previous generation. Handling was a strong point, with quick and precise steering and minimal body roll. Fit and finish received excellent marks, with reviewers noting the car felt very upscale. The front seats were firm but well liked, and the rear seat was roomy, in contrast to the cramped quarters in the fourth generation. Controls and displays were generally good. Reviewers were particularly impressed with the [...] "Sportline" [...] models (known as the GLI in North America). Equipped with sport seats, a firmer suspension lowered by 15 mm, and <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> <b>tyres,</b> critics praised the excellent handling that was an improvement over the already good performance on the standard model. Additionally, the 2.0 Turbo FSI engine also won commendation for its high power figures, smooth operation, and low fuel consumption. Along with its hatchback brethren, the fifth generation ranks among the top cars on the market in independent reviews of resale value.|$|R
5000|$|The {{other new}} arrival was the Prisma 4WD, {{featuring}} a two-litre fuel injected engine and Lancia's three differential permanent four wheel drive. Derived from the flagship Thema, the 1995 cc, twin-cam 8-valve engine featured two counter rotating balance shafts and IAW fuel injection; it developed [...] and 163 Nm. The 4WD package {{was completed by}} four disk brakes from the 1.6, power steering and wide, <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> 185/60 <b>tyres</b> on 14-inch 8-spoke alloy wheels. Minor details set the 4WD apart from other Prismas: outside a [...] "4WD" [...] script on the right half of the grille and on the new side skirts, inside it sported the instrument panel from the Delta HF 4WD with six round gauges, yellow scales and hands.|$|R

He {{finished in the}} top ten 23 times, with his best finish in 2nd position in 1953 at Phoenix. In his last race, at the Indy 500, he drove the innovative John Crosthwaite designed Harvey Aluminium Special ‘roller skate car’ with the then pioneering <b>low</b> <b>profile,</b> wide racing <b>tyres</b> and a stock Chevrolet engine.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} was performed {{during the summer}} and autumn in 1984. The purpose was to investigate factors on <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> implement <b>tyres</b> affecting the coefficient of rolling resistance. The following factors were studied: - inflation pressure - width - diameter - construction - ply rating - aspect ratio - tread pattern Tests wars performed on concrete, harrowed fields, ploughed fields and stubble. Important factors when reducing the CRR when driving on concrete are: - increase the diameter and width - higher ply rating - decrease in aspect ratio - less aggressive tread pattern - choice of particular constructions (Garden Tractor or Steel Belt). The most important factor in reducing rolling resistance on soft ground is to ensure that the tyre size is adequate to carry the vertical load at as low inflation pressure as possible. A big soft tyre with low inflation pressure giving no or little sinkage is desirable. Choice of aggressive tread patterns will lead to an increase in rolling resistance because of the energy losses produced by the high compaction under the lugs. The relation between diameter and width must be large enough to ensure no or a minimum of bulldozing resistance. Reducing rolling resistance will lead to a number of advantages. The low inflation pressures will cause a decrease in soil compaction, and there will be an increase in yields. Lower railing resistance will also result in savings in fuel and time...|$|R
