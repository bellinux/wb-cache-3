Increased target temperature, electrode tip length and electrode diameter increased the simulated lesion size, which is in accordance with experimental results. The influence of blood perfusion, modelled as an increase in thermal conductivity in non-coagulated tissue, gave smaller simulated lesions with increasing blood perfusion as heat was more efficiently conducted from the rim of the lesion. If no consideration was taken to the coagulation the lesion became larger with increased thermal conductivity instead, as the increase in conducted heat was compensated for through an increased power output {{in order to maintain the}} target temperature. Simulated lesions corresponded well to experimental in-vivo lesions. The electric conductivity in a homogeneous surrounding had little impact on lesion development. However this was not valid for a heterogeneous surrounding. CSF-filled cysts have a much higher electric conductivity than brain tissue focussing the current to them if the electrode tip is in contact with both. Heating of CSF can also cause considerable convective flow and as a result a very efficient heat transfer. This affected simulated as well as experimental lesion sizes and shapes resulting in both very large lesions if sufficient power compared to the cysts size was supplied and very small lesions if the power was low, mitigating the heat over a large volume. In conclusion especially blood perfusion and CSF can greatly affect the <b>lesioning</b> <b>process</b> and appear to be important to consider when planning surgical procedures.

40|$|Radiofrequency lesioning of nuclei in the {{thalamus}} or the {{basal ganglia}} {{can be used}} to reduce symptoms caused by e. g. movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Enlarged cavities containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are commonly present in the basal ganglia and tend to increase in size and number with age. Since the cavities have different electrical and thermal properties compared with brain tissue, it is likely that they can affect the <b>lesioning</b> <b>process</b> and thereby the treatment outcome. Computer simulations using the finite element method and in vitro experiments have been used to investigate the impact of cysts on lesions' size and shape. Simulations of the electric current and temperature distributions as well as convective movements have been conducted for various sizes, shapes and locations of the cysts as well as different target temperatures. Circulation of the CSF caused by the heating was found to spread heat effectively and the higher electric conductivity of the CSF increased heating of the cyst. These two effects were together able to greatly alter the resulting lesion size and shape when the cyst was in contact with the electrode tip. Similar results were obtained for the experiments.

40|$|Radio-Frequency (RF) lesioning, or RF ablation, is {{a method}} that uses high {{frequency}} currents for thermal coagulation of pathological tissue or signal pathways. The current is delivered from an electrode, which also contains a temperature sensor permitting control of the current at a desired target temperature. In the brain, RF lesioning can e. g. be used for treatment of severe chronic pain and movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. This thesis focuses on modelling and simulation {{with the aim of}} gaining better understanding and predictability of the <b>lesioning</b> <b>process</b> in the central brain.   The finite element method (FEM), together with experimental comparisons, was used to study the effects of electric and thermal conductivity, blood perfusion (Paper I), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filled cysts (Paper II) on resulting lesion volume and shape in brain tissue. The influence of blood perfusion was modelled as an increase in thermal conductivity in non-coagulated tissue. This model gave smaller simulated lesions with increasing blood perfusion as heat was more efficiently conducted from the rim of the lesion. If the coagulation was not taken into consideration, the lesion became larger with increasing thermal conductivity instead, as the increase in conducted heat was compensated for through an increased power output {{in order to maintain the}} target temperature. Simulated lesions corresponded well to experimental in-vivo lesions. The electric conductivity in a homogeneous surrounding had little impact but this was not true for a heterogeneous surrounding. CSF has a much higher electric conductivity than brain tissue, which focused the current to the cyst if the electrode tip was in contact with both a cyst and brain tissue. Heating of CSF could also cause considerable convective flow and as a result a very efficient heat transfer. This affected both simulated and experimental lesion sizes and shapes. As a result both very large and very small lesions could be obtained depending on whether sufficient power was supplied or if the heating was mitigated over a large volume.   Clinical (Paper IV) and experimental (Paper III) measurements were used for investigation of changes in reflected light intensity from undamaged and coagulating brain tissue respectively. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for light transport were made for comparison (Paper V). For the optical measurements, an RF electrode with adjacent optical fibres was used and this electrode was also modelled for the optical simulations. According to the MC simulations, coagulation should make grey matter lighter and white matter darker, while thalamic light grey should remain approximately the same. Experiments in ex-vivo porcine tissue gave an increase in reflected light intensity from grey matter at approximately 50  °C but the signal was very variable and the isotherm 60 °C gave better agreement between simulated and experimental lesions. No consistent decrease in reflected light intensity could be seen during coagulation of white matter. Clinical measurements were performed during the creation of 21 trajectories for deep brain stimulation electrodes. In agreement with the simulations, reflected light intensity was found to differentiate well between undamaged grey, light grey and white matter.   In conclusion, blood perfusion and CSF in particular may greatly affect the <b>lesioning</b> <b>process</b> and can be important to consider when planning surgery. Reflected light intensity seems unreliable for the detection of coagulation in light grey brain matter such as the thalamus. However, it seems very promising for navigation in the brain and for detection of coagulation in other tissue types such as muscle...|$|E

Important features that guide the DNA/protein interactions are {{the presence of an}} extended positively charged region and of a molecular tweezers that strongly constrains DNA. Our results are on very good agreement with the experimentally determined repair rate of clustered abasic lesions. The lack of repair for one particular arrangement of the two abasic sites is also explained considering the peculiar destabilizing interaction between the recognition region and the second lesion, resulting in a partial opening of the molecular tweezers and, thus, a less stable complex.

40|$|Among {{the various}} types of DNA damage, inter-strand cross-links (ICL) {{represent}} one of the most cytotoxic <b>lesions.</b> <b>Processes</b> such as transcription and replication can be fully blocked by ICLs, as shown by the mechanism of action of some anticancer drugs. However, repair of ICLs can be a possible cause of resistance. To study the mechanisms of cross-link repair stable, site-specifically cross-linked duplexes are needed. We here report on the synthesis of site-specifically cross-linked DNA using an acyclic furan containing nucleoside. Selective in situ oxidation of the incorporated furan moiety generates a highly reactive oxo-enal that instantly reacts with the complementary base in a non-modified strand, yielding one specific stable cross-linked duplex species. Varying sequence context showed that a strong selectivity for cross-linking to either complementary A or complementary C is operating, without formation of cross-links to neighboring or distant bases. Reaction times are very short and high isolated yields are obtained using only one equivalent of modified strand. The formed covalent link is stable and the isolated cross-linked duplexes can be stored for several months without degradation. Structural characterization of the obtained ICL was possible by comparison to the natural mutagenic adducts of cis- 2 -butene- 1, 4 -dial, a metabolite of furan primarily responsible for furan carcinogenicity...|$|R

The majority of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is caused by mutation of the human DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes and is detected by associated microsatellite instability (MSI). Seventy-three unselected urothelial carcinomas of the ureter and/or renal pelvis were screened for MSI using the National Cancer Institute-designated reference panel (plus BAT 40). Instability of at least two microsatellite markers (MSI-high) was detected in 15 samples (21 %). Immunohistochemical staining of the MMR proteins (hMSH 2, hMLH 1, or hMSH 6) was absent in 13 of 15 (87 %) MSI tumors, and alteration of coding sequence microsatellites (TGFbetaRII, Bax, hMSH 3, and hMSH 6) was found at frequencies of 7 - 33 % in these samples. Tumors with MSI had significantly different clinical and histopathological features including higher prevalence in female patients, low tumor stage and grade, and a papillary and frequently inverted growth pattern. Our results suggest a molecular pathway of tumorigenesis that is similar to MMR-deficient colorectal cancers and consistent with the notion that the site distributions of hereditary or sporadic MSI-high tumors may reflect tissue-specific susceptibility to <b>lesions</b> <b>processed</b> by the MMR machinery...|$|R

Methods and results We evaluated carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity (PWV) in 53 Chagas' disease patients compared with 31 healthy volunteers (control group). The 53 patients were classified into 3 groups: 1) 16 with indeterminate form of Chagas' disease; 2) 18 with Chagas' disease, electrocardiographic abnormalities, and normal systolic function; 3) 19 with Chagas' disease, systolic dysfunction, and mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure. No difference was noted between the 4 groups regarding carotid-femoral PWV (8. 4 ± 1. 1 vs 8. 2 ± 1. 5 vs 8. 2 ± 1. 4 vs 8. 7 ± 1. 6 m/s, P = 0. 6) or pulse pressure (39. 5 ± 7. 6 vs 39. 3 ± 8. 1 vs 39. 5 ± 7. 4 vs 39. 7 ± 6. 9 mm Hg, P = 0. 9). A positive, significant, similar correlation occurred between PWV and age in patients with Chagas' disease (r = 0. 42, P = 0. 002), in controls (r = 0. 48, P = 0. 006), and also between PWV and systolic blood pressure in both groups (patients with Chagas' disease, r = 0. 38, P = 0. 005; healthy subjects, r = 0. 36, P = 0. 043).

Methods A lesion mapping {{was carried out by}} an experienced neurologist for Turbo Inversion Recovery Magnitude (TIRM) images of individual subjects. Combining this mapping with templates from a neuroanatomic atlas, the TIRM images were segmented into three areas of homogenous tissue types (Lesions, NAGM, and NAWM) after spatial standardization. For each area, a linear Support Vector Machine algorithm was used in multiple local classification analyses to determine the diagnostic accuracy in separating MS patients from healthy controls based on voxel tissue intensity patterns extracted from small spherical subregions of these larger areas. To control for covariates, we also excluded group-specific biases in deformation fields as a potential source of information.

Several autoantigens were already identified, including cardiac myosin epitopes, vimentin, and other intracellular proteins. In the heart tissue, antigen-driven oligoclonal T cell expansions were probably the effectors of the rheumatic heart lesions.
