40|$|AbstractThe {{oxidative}} {{and physical}} {{stability of the}} reformulated mayonnaise with processed beetroot was investigated and compared with a control (mayonnaise without beetroot) and a commercially available product. Processing <b>of</b> <b>beetroot</b> {{had an impact on}} the structural integrity of the antioxidants present. Microwaving (960 W for 7 min) was advantageous for preserving the betalain and polyphenol content <b>of</b> <b>beetroot</b> compared to roasting (180 °C for 90 min) and boiling (100 °C for 30 min). The oxidative stability of mayonnaise samples was determined by Rancimat and the thiobarbituric (TBA) assay. The addition <b>of</b> microwaved <b>beetroot</b> significantly enhanced the oxidative stability of mayonnaise at the end of a storage period of 4 weeks (4 °C). Although no significant differences (p> 0. 05) were detected between the mayonnaise samples containing beetroot and the commercial control, the latter was less susceptible to oxidation during storage. The turbiscan stability index (TSI) revealed that the commercial mayonnaise was less prone to destabilization phenomena. All the textural parameters increased with the incorporation <b>of</b> <b>beetroot.</b> The sensory evaluation revealed that, with the exception of graininess and uniformity, most of the sensory attributes are preserved if not improved with the addition <b>of</b> <b>beetroot...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background. Beetroot {{consumption}} {{has been}} proposed to improve exercise performance, since the nitrate content of this food is able to stimulate the synthesis of nitric oxide. Objective. The acute effect of 100 [*]g <b>of</b> a <b>beetroot</b> gel containing ~ 10 [*]mmol of nitrate was tested on the nitric oxide synthesis, on metabolic and biochemical parameters, and on performance in physically active individuals.

We questioned whether a similar effect would be observed during variable work rate exercise at a specific rating of perceived exertion (RPE), as is commonly prescribed for aerobic training sessions. Using a double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover design, ten females (25 ± 3 years; VO 2 peak 37. 1 ± 5. 3 ml/kg/min) performed two 20 -min cycle ergometer trials at a constant RPE of 13 (somewhat hard) 2. 5 hours following ingestion of 140 ml <b>of</b> concentrated <b>beetroot</b> juice (12. 9 mmol nitrate), or nitrate-depleted placebo. Performance was measured in terms of total VO 2 (L) consumed and total mechanical work (kJ) accomplished across each trial.

40|$|Background: Beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.) is a dietary {{source of}} natural {{antioxidants}} and inorganic nitrate (NO 3 –).

Objective: The aim {{of the present study was}} to formulate a beetroot gel to supplement dietary nitrate and antioxidant compounds able to cause beneficial health effects following acute administration. Design and subjects: A beetroot juice produced from Beta vulgaris L., without any chemical additives, was used. The juice was evaluated by physicochemical and microbiological parameters.

Beetroot juice increases levels of nitric oxide (NO), which serves multiple functions related to increased blood flow, gas exchange, mitochondrial biogenesis and efficiency, and strengthening of muscle contraction.

The aim of this literature review {{was to determine the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>beetroot</b> juice supplementation and the combination <b>of</b> <b>beetroot</b> juice with other supplements on cardiorespiratory endurance in athletes. A keyword search of DialNet, MedLine, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases covered publications from 2010 to 2016. After excluding reviews/meta-analyses, animal studies, inaccessible full-text, and studies that did not supplement with beetroot juice and adequately assess cardiorespiratory endurance, 23 articles were selected for analysis. The available results suggest that supplementation with beetroot juice can improve cardiorespiratory endurance in athletes by increasing efficiency, which improves performance at various distances, increases time to exhaustion at submaximal intensities, and may improve the cardiorespiratory performance at anaerobic threshold intensities and maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2 max). Although the literature shows contradictory data, the findings of other studies lead us to hypothesize that supplementing with beetroot juice could mitigate the ergolytic effects of hypoxia on cardiorespiratory endurance in athletes.
