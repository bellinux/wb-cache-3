40|$|Hierarchical classes (HICLAS) models {{constitute}} a distinct family of structural models for N-way N-mode data. All {{members of the}} family include N simultaneous and <b>linked</b> <b>classifications</b> of the el-ements of the N modes implied by the data; those classifications are organized in terms of hierarchical, if–then-type relations. Moreover, the models are accompanied by comprehensive, insightful graphical rep-resentations. Up to now, the hierarchical classes family has been limited to dichotomous or dichotomized data. In the present paper we propose a novel extension of the family to two-way two-mode rating data (HICLAS-R). The HICLAS-R model preserves the representation of simultaneous and linked classifica-tions as well as of generalized if–then-type relations, and keeps being accompanied by a comprehensive graphical representation. It is shown to bear interesting relationships with classical real-valued two-way component analysis and with methods of optimal scaling. Key words: rating data, hierarchical classes, two-mode clustering. The family of hierarchical classes (acronym: HICLAS) models, as introduced by De Boeck and Rosenberg (1988), and further extended by Van Mechelen et al. (1995), Leenen et al. (1999), Ceulemans et al. (2003), and Ceulemans and Van Mechelen (2004), constitutes a distinct family of structural models for binary N-way N-mode data D. Hierarchical classes analysis of a binar...|$|E

We derive learning bounds in terms of correlation clustering within three fundamental transductive learning settings: online, batch and active. Our main algorithmic contribution is in the active setting, where we introduce a new family of efficient link classifiers based on covering the input graph with small circuits.

More generally, we show an algorithm that achieves optimality to within a factor of O(k) by querying at most order of |V | + (|V |/k) 3 / 2 edge labels.

It is a means to inferring the evolutionary state and history of galaxies. There is a set of conventional associations we have learned to make between morphology and the inferred nature of galaxies.

40|$|We {{show that}} a {{variation}} of Milnor's ¯ ¯-invariants, the so-called Campbell-Hausdorff invariants introduced recently by Stefan Papadima, are of finite type with respect to marked singular links. These link invariants are stronger than quantum invariants {{in the sense that}} they detect easily the non-invertibility of links with more than one components. It is still open whether some effectively computable knot invariants, e. g. finite type knot invariants (Vassiliev invariants), could detect the non-invertibility of knots. 1. Introduction It is well-known that the indeterminacy of Milnor's ¯ ¯-invariants [14, 15] is inadequate for various <b>link</b> <b>classification</b> problems (see, for example, [9, 7]). Moreover, the indeterminacy of ¯ ¯-invariants depends on individual links so that a fixed ¯ ¯-invariant takes values in different cyclic groups on different links. This awkwardness is the reason why in [2, 10], where one studies whether ¯ ¯-invariants are of finite type, one has to drop off the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} triangles in a graph is a {{fundamental}} metric, used in social network analysis, <b>link</b> <b>classification</b> and recommendation, and more. Driven by these applications and the trend that modern graph datasets are both large and dynamic, we present the design and implementation of a fast and cache-efficient parallel algorithm for estimating the number of triangles in a massive undirected graph whose edges arrive as a stream. It brings together the benefits of streaming algorithms and parallel algorithms. By building on the streaming algorithms framework, the algorithm has a small memory footprint. By leveraging the paralell cache-oblivious framework, it makes efficient use of the memory hierarchy of modern multicore machines without needing to know its specific parameters. We prove theoretical bounds on accuracy, memory access cost, and parallel runtime complexity, as well as showing empirically that the algorithm yields accurate results and substantial speedups compared to an optimized sequential implementation.

40|$|From {{a machine}} {{learning}} perspective, information retrieval {{may be viewed}} as a problem of classifying items into one of two classes corresponding to interesting and uninteresting items respectively. A natural performance metric in this context is classification accuracy, defined as the fraction of the system’s interesting/uninteresting predictions that agree with the user’s assessments. On the other hand, the field of information retrieval has two classical performance evaluation metrics: precision, the fraction of the items retrieved by the system that are interest-ing to the user, and recall, the fraction of the items of interest to the user that are retrieved by the system. In the present paper we present {{for the first time a}} general mathematical relation <b>linking</b> <b>classification</b> accuracy with precision and recall. Our relation provides an analytical tool that promises to be useful in theoretical and applied work in information retrieval.

In this paper we propose new objective classification quality estimators for both evaluating and optimising the results of the classification and of the mapping methods, especially when they are applied in the domain of documentary databases.

Our main contribution is a fast and easy-to-implement constant approximation framework for the problem, which builds on a novel reduction of the problem to that of cor-relation clustering.
