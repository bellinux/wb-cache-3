This ability to talk securely and immediately across agency and military service boundaries is often overlooked. One way to ensure interoperability is to develop and promote federal communication standards (FS). This thesis surveys one ares of the proposed FS 1024 for LMRs; namely, the error detection and correction (EDAC) of the message indicator (MI) bits used for cryptographic synchronization. Several EDAC codes are examined (Hamming, Quadratic Residue, hard decision Golay and soft decision Golay), tested on three Fortran programmed channel simulations (INMARSAT, Gaussian and constant burst width), compared and analyzed (based on bit error rates and percent of error-free super-frame runs) so that a best code can be recommended. Out of the four codes under study, the soft decision Golay code (24, 12) is evaluated to be the best. This finding {{is based on the}} code's ability to detect and correct errors as well as the relative ease of implementation of the algorithm. Civilian, U. S. Department of Defens...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on developing RF feedforward cancellation systems for wideband interference signals appearing at close proximity from the receiver. The system is designed to target high interference risks in the Upper- 700 MHz band (746 - 805 MHz) following the congestion in the spectrum between public safety <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>radios,</b> LTE broadband public safety and LTE commercial mobile. New low-profile planar band-stop resonators are designed to obtain a wide-band and a high roll-off rejection (> 1 dB per MHz). Two new design methodologies of band-stop resonators are presented in this work. The first approach incorporates the use of power splitters and large delay transmission lines, and the second methodology uses finite cell artificial left-hand transmission lines. The two structures are used in separating the receiver wanted signal from the interferer, and this separation is required to generate {{a replica of the}} interferer, which later becomes an input to the cancellation phase of the system. The system is tested using two generated LTE modulated signals, modeling the interference and the wanted signals, which are 20, 15 and 10 MHz apart. The test results have shown successful cancellation for 9 MHz wide interference signals. The cancellation can be further improved over a wide band, by increasing the linearity of the phase shifters used in the feedforward system. Therefore, new RF MEMS switch based phase shifters are designed, implemented and measured. Measurements of the new phase shifters have successfully reduced the RMS amplitude deviation, which is calculated between all the phase states over a 100 MHz bandwidth, by 66 % when compared to the phase shifter used in the above interference cancellation tests...|$|R

The proposed center-fed, third iteration antenna has been manufactured using both copper tape and ShieldIt Super, a conductive textile. It has been tested on four types of ground plane, i. e. rectangular, fractal Minkowski, meander line and L-shaped. It is observed that an L-shaped ground plane performs the best, and provides an additional frequency tuning parameter to the overall structure. Simulated and measured S 11 show a good agreement and the proposed antenna is working within the desired frequency range. A simulated gain and efficiency of more than 1. 9 dB and 76 %, respectively, are obtained. The measurement in a Satimo SG 64 anechoic chamber provided 0 dB gain and about 48 % efficiency. status: publishe...|$|R
