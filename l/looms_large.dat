5|$|The first written {{records of}} native life {{begin in the}} 6th century AD, when the {{founding}} of the kingdom of Dál Riata took place. This encompassed roughly what is now Argyll and Bute and Lochaber in Scotland and County Antrim in Ireland. The figure of Columba <b>looms</b> <b>large</b> in any history of Dál Riata, and his founding of a monastery on Iona ensured that the kingdom would be of great importance in the spread of Christianity in northern Britain. However, Iona was far from unique. Lismore in the territory of the Cenél Loairn, was sufficiently important for the death of its abbots to be recorded with some frequency and many smaller sites, such as on Eigg, Hinba, and Tiree, are known from the annals.|$|E
25|$|The Sino-Soviet rift and the {{obsession}} with Khrushchev's revisionism <b>looms</b> <b>large</b> {{in the coming}} of the Cultural Revolution, as Mao saw revisionism and de-Stalinization as a threat not only to his own position but also to the very survival of the Chinese Communist Party as a revolutionary force. Accordingly, an appreciation of Kang's role as a supporter of Mao's line in this period helps explain his return to very near the pinnacle of power a few years later.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{folk music}} often {{includes}} sung words, although folk instrumental music occurs commonly in dance music traditions. Narrative verse <b>looms</b> <b>large</b> {{in the traditional}} folk music of many cultures. This encompasses such forms as traditional epic poetry, much of which was meant originally for oral performance, sometimes accompanied by instruments. Many epic poems of various cultures were pieced together from shorter pieces of traditional narrative verse, which explains their episodic structure, repetitive elements, and their frequent in medias res plot developments. Other forms of traditional narrative verse relate the outcomes of battles or describe tragedies or natural disasters.|$|E

But it was as a painter of portraits that Titian excelled, his longevity allowing him to achieve far more, both in the way of production and in stylistic development than either Giorgione or his Florentine contemporary Raphael were able to. Titian gave the world images of Pietro Aretino and Pope Paul III and many other people of his day, perhaps his most powerful portrait being that of Doge Andrea Gritti, ruler of Venice, who <b>looms</b> <b>large</b> in the picture space, one huge hand clasping his heavily buttoned robe in a dynamic Expressionistic gesture.

[...] While Spiegelman {{was far from the}} first to do {{autobiography}} in comics, critics such as James Campbell considered Maus the work that popularized it. [...] The bestseller has been widely written about in the popular press and academia—the quantity of its critical literature far outstrips that of any other work of comics. [...] It has been examined from a great variety of academic viewpoints, though most often by those with little understanding of Maus context in the history of comics. [...] While Maus has been credited with lifting comics from popular culture into the world of high art in the public imagination, criticism has tended to ignore its deep roots in popular culture, roots that Spiegelman has intimate familiarity with and has devoted considerable time to promote.|$|E
500|$|L. Ron Hubbard was the {{inventor}} of Dianetics and founder of Scientology. Born in Tilden, Nebraska in March 1911, Hubbard grew up {{with his family in}} Helena, Montana. He was unusually well-traveled for a young man of his time due to his father's frequent relocations in connection with his service in the United States Navy. He lived in a number of locations in the United States and traveled to Guam, the Philippines, China, and Japan. He enrolled at George Washington University in 1930 to study civil engineering, but dropped out in his second year. While at GWU, he organized an expedition to the Caribbean for fellow students which <b>looms</b> <b>large</b> in his official biography but was a flop according to contemporary accounts. He subsequently spent time in Puerto Rico panning for gold, before returning to the United States, marrying his pregnant girlfriend, and embarking on a career as a [...] "penny-a-word" [...] writer.|$|E
500|$|Fifteen {{original}} {{tracks were}} considered for inclusion on the album, which Reznor described as [...] "Highly conceptual. Quite noisy. Fucking cool." [...] Reznor also described the album as a [...] "collage of sound type of thing", citing musical inspiration from early Public Enemy records, specifically the production techniques of The Bomb Squad. Most of Year Zeros musical elements {{were created by}} Reznor solely on his laptop, {{as opposed to the}} instrument-heavy With Teeth. AllMusic's review described the album's laptop-mixed sound: [...] "guitars squall against glitches, beeps, pops, and blotches of blurry sonic attacks. Percussion <b>looms</b> <b>large,</b> distorted, organic, looped, screwed, spindled and broken." [...] Many reviews of the album compared the album's electronic sound to earlier Nine Inch Nails releases such as The Downward Spiral and The Fragile, while contrasting its heavily modified sounds to the more [...] "organic" [...] approach of With Teeth. Many critics also commented on the album's overall tone, including descriptions such as [...] "lots of silver and grey ambience" [...] and reference to the album's [...] "oblique tone". [...] The New York Times review described the album's sound by saying [...] "Hard beats are softened with distortion, static cushions the tantrums, sneaky bass lines float beneath the surface." [...] The article went on to describe individual tracks: [...] "And as usual the music is packed with details: [...] "Meet Your Master" [...] goes through at least three cycles of decay and rebirth; part of the fun of [...] "The Warning" [...] is tracking the ever-mutating timbres." ...|$|E

500|$|Certain {{techniques}} and styles {{can be found}} throughout Nine Inch Nails' catalog. Songs such as [...] "Wish", and [...] "The Day the World Went Away" [...] exhibit terraced dynamics. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. He also has used software to alter his voice in several songs, as evident in [...] "Starfuckers, Inc." [...] and [...] "Burn". The band's music also occasionally contains complex time signatures, notably in [...] "The Collector", from With Teeth, and concert favorite [...] "March of the Pigs". Reznor regularly uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements, and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody and/or harmony. These techniques are all used in the song [...] "Hurt", which contains a highly dissonant tritone played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word [...] "I" [...] every time the B/E# dyad is played. [...] "Closer" [...] concludes with a chromatic piano motif: The melody is debuted during the second verse of [...] "Piggy" [...] on organ, then reappears in power chords at drop D tuning throughout the chorus of [...] "Heresy", while an inverted (ascending) version is used throughout [...] "A Warm Place", and then recurs in its original state for the final time on [...] "The Downward Spiral". On The Fragile, Reznor revisits this technique of repeating a motif multiple times throughout different songs, either on a different musical instrument, with a transposed harmony, or in an altered tempo. Many of the songs on Year Zero contain an extended instrumental ending, which encompasses the entire {{second half of the}} three-minute long [...] "The Great Destroyer".

2500|$|Tabinshwehti's legacy <b>looms</b> <b>large.</b> Although {{he did not}} {{implement}} any administrative reforms, {{his military}} conquests assembled the largest kingdom in Burma {{since the fall of}} Pagan in 1287. His administratively fragile kingdom proved to be the impetus for the eventual reunification of the entire country under Bayinnaung, even if the core of the reunified Burmese state would stabilize only in the early 17th century. Though he may initially have been urged on by his court, it was ultimately his decision to start a war with a wealthier but poorly led neighbor, and to persist until the victory over Hanthawaddy was achieved. He quickly built on the success by combining his kingdom's [...] "more martial tradition" [...] with the maritime wealth and manpower of Lower Burma, which enabled him to acquire foreign mercenaries and firearms. This fortuitous combination would ultimately lead to his founding of the Toungoo Empire. His success in breaking out of an increasingly narrow dry zone not only saved the only remaining ethnic Burman-led kingdom from extinction but also ensured the continued spread of Burmese culture and language in the Irrawaddy valley.|$|E
2500|$|According to BJ Terwiel, {{there are}} ten {{different}} {{accounts of the}} battle by indigenous, European and Persian authors: (four Siamese, one Burmese, four late 16th and early 17th century European accounts and late 17th century one Persian account). Only the Siamese royal chronicle account says there was a formal elephant duel between Naresuan and Swa. Per Terwiel's analysis of the ten accounts, Swa and Naresuan both fought on their war elephant in the battle but no formal duel probably ever took place. According to Terwiel, {{it is highly unlikely}} that Swa would have agreed to a formal duel since agreeing to do so would have [...] "jeopardized the costly invasion that had thus far progressed without a hitch." [...] During the battle, Naresuan's elephant got surrounded by the Burmese forces. During that crucial moment, a Burmese war elephant went musth, and attacked Swa's elephant. Seeing that Swa was in difficulty, Naresuan [...] "closed in, and he (or one of the warriors riding with him, maybe a Portuguese) fired a gun which mortally wounded the crown prince" [...] Swa. Naresuan was [...] "lucky to escape from a very dangerous situation" [...] but also quick to take advantage of it. According to Terwiel, the [...] "Burmese and European accounts stayed closer to what actually may have happened", and [...] "Naresuan's much repeated challenge to hold a duel, even though it <b>looms</b> <b>large</b> in many Thai history books, should be relegated to a legendary tale." ...|$|E
