5|$|Matthias {{married his}} first wife, Catherine of Poděbrady, in 1461. She died in {{childbirth}} in 1464. His second wife, Beatrice of Naples, whom he married in 1476, was infertile.

5|$|Sigurd Eysteinsson and Thorstein the Red {{moved on}} {{northern}} Scotland, conquering large areas variously {{described in the}} sagas as constituting all of Caithness and Sutherland and possibly including territory in Ross and even Moray during the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> the 9th century. The Orkneyinga Saga relates how the former defeated the Pict Máel Brigte Tusk but died from an unusual post-battle injury.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} {{literacy}} in the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> {{the twentieth century}} was particularly remarkable with special emphasis on the eradication of illiteracy.

5|$|Although Charles Holden had {{gradually}} reduced his workload, he {{was still}} continuing {{to go into the}} office three days per week during the early 1950s.

In the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> his life, Holden was himself physically weaker and was looked after by his niece Minnie Green.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the themes}} of Hemming's work is the depredations {{suffered}} by his monastery {{at the hands of}} royal officials. One such notorious official from the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> King Æthelred's reign is Eadric Streona ("Grasper"), ealdorman of Mercia, blamed for having appropriated land held by the church in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire and for having incorporated the ancient county of Winchcombeshire into Gloucestershire. Hemming may have invented Eadric's byname of Streona, as it is not attested before appearing in Hemming's work.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990, {{only four}} {{pitchers}} {{have joined the}} 300win club: Roger Clemens, Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and Johnson. Changes in {{the game in the}} <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century have made attaining 300career wins difficult, perhaps more so than during the mid 20thcentury. The four-man starting rotation has given way to a five-man rotation, which gives starting pitchers fewer chances to pick up wins. No pitcher reached 20wins in a non strike-shortened {{year for the first time}} in 2006; this was repeated in 2009 and 2017.|$|E

5|$|The legendary traditions {{may also}} be in {{connection}} with the establishment of a trans-Carpathian frontier mark by the Hungarian monarchy, with its capital at Câmpulung, probably in the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> the 13th century. A tomb stone belonging to {{one of the leaders of}} this formation, Count Lawrence of Câmpulung (comes Laurentius de Longo Campo), dating from the year 1300, may provide a solid chronological reference point. On the other hand, comes Laurentius may have been a one-time leader of the Saxon community in Câmpulung.|$|E
5|$|The {{little that}} is known of Mac Scelling {{suggests}} {{that he was an}} early archetype of what latter became known as gallowglasses, heavily-armed mercenaries, recruited from the West Highlands and Islands of Scotland by Irish rulers in later centuries. Although first specifically recorded in the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> the thirteenth century, gallowglasses were almost certainly utilised at least a generation before. The aforesaid apparent reference to Mac Scelling by La Geste des Engleis en Yrlande could be evidence that he had taken up residence in Ireland like later gallowglasses.|$|E

5|$|Bjaðmunjo was a {{daughter}} of Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland (died 1119). In the late eleventh century, {{following the death of}} his father, Muirchertach seized control of the Kingdom of Munster and moved to extend his authority throughout Ireland as High King of Ireland. In so doing, he gained control of the Norse-Gaelic Kingdom of Dublin, and as a result began to extend his influence into the nearby Kingdom of the Isles. There is uncertainty concerning the political situation in the Isles in the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> the eleventh century. What is known for sure is that, {{before the end of the}} century, Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway (died 1103) led a marauding fleet from Scandinavia into the Irish Sea region, where he held power until his death in 1103.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century, {{minerals}} such as gold were mined {{with limited}} success. The last mine was abandoned in 1907, but panning for gold is still allowed {{in many areas}} of the forest, and in most circumstances no permit is required. After the end of the mining era, numerous camps were established by the Civilian Conservation Corps to help combat unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The camps housed groups of unemployed men who were paid by the federal government to build roads, hiking trails, and campgrounds for future travelers to the Yellowstone region. Visitation to national forests like Shoshone increased dramatically after World War II with the advent of better roads and accessibility to the region.|$|E
5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} in the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, {{he was at least}} as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{first entered}} {{what would become}} Indiana {{near the end of}} the last ice age. The region around Harrison County was of {{particular}} value to the early humans because of the abundance of flint. There is evidence of flint mining in local caves as early as 2000BCE; the stone was used to produce crude tools. Passing migratory tribes frequented the area which was influenced by succeeding groups of peoples including the Hopewells and Mississippians. One flint-working and camping location is known as the Swan's Landing Archeological Site; it is among the most important Early Archaic archaeological sites anywhere in eastern North America. Permanent human settlements in the county began with the arrival of American settlers in the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> the 18thcentury.|$|E
5|$|In 1816, {{the couple}} famously spent a summer with Lord Byron, John William Polidori, and Claire Clairmont near Geneva, Switzerland, where Mary {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} her novel Frankenstein. The Shelleys left Britain in 1818 for Italy, where their second and third children died before Mary Shelley {{gave birth to her}} last and only surviving child, Percy Florence Shelley. In 1822, her husband drowned when his sailing boat sank during a storm near Viareggio. A year later, Mary Shelley returned to England and from then on devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author. The <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> her life was dogged by illness, probably caused by the brain tumour that was to kill her at the age of 53.|$|E
5|$|In the 1790s, Johnson aligned {{himself with}} the {{supporters}} of the French Revolution, and published {{an increasing number of}} political pamphlets in addition to a prominent journal, the Analytical Review, which offered British reformers a voice in the public sphere. In 1799, he was indicted on charges of seditious libel for publishing a pamphlet by the Unitarian minister Gilbert Wakefield. After spending six months in prison, albeit under relatively comfortable conditions, Johnson published fewer political works. In the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> his career, Johnson did not seek out many new writers; however, he remained successful by publishing the collected works of authors such as William Shakespeare.|$|E
