40|$|Abstract Stemborers and <b>leaffolders</b> are {{two groups}} of {{lepidopteran}} pests that cause severe damage to rice {{in many areas of}} the world. In this study, a cry 1 C * gene encoding Bacillus thuringi-ensis (Bt) d-endotoxin was synthesized by codon optimization as the first step towards gene stack-ing in our resistance management strategy of transgenic rice. Agrobacterium-mediated trans-formation of this gene into Minghui 63 (Oryza sativa L.), an elite indica CMS restorer line, produced 120 independently transformed plants, 19 of which had a single-copy transgene. Pre-liminary screening of T 1 families of these 19 transformants in the field identified five lines showing a high level of resistance to <b>leaffolders</b> (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis) and stemborers. Hy-brids were produced by crossing these five lines with Zhenshan 97 A, the male-sterile line for Shanyou 63, the most widely cultivated hybrid in China. These five lines and their hybrids were highly resistant to yellow stemborer (Tryporyza incertulas) as revealed by an insect bioassay. The content of Cry 1 C * protein varied considerably among the five lines as well as among the corre-sponding hybrids. T 1 c- 19, a line showing the highest content of Cry 1 C * protein, and its hybrid were tested in the field for insect resistance and agronomic performance and found to be highly resistant to stemborers and <b>leaffolders</b> through-out the growth period, resulting in a significantly increased grain yield compared with the respec-tive controls. These results indicate that T 1 c- 19 can be used for production of insect-resistant hybrid rice and as a germplasm for gene stacking to produce rice plants with two toxins...|$|R
40|$|Marasmia exigua (Butler) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) {{is one of}} {{the major}} rice <b>leaffolders</b> {{negatively}} affecting the rice production in the world. The growth and development of M. exigua was studied at seven constant temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 27, 30 and 35 °C). The results showed that M. exigua eggs failed to hatch at 10 °C and the larvae could not complete development at 15 and 35 °C. The developmental times of each stage, survival rates of pre-adult, adult longevity, fecundities and oviposition days of M. exigua at 20, 25, 27 and 30 °C were investigated using age-stage, two-sex life table. The total pre-adult development time decreased with the increase in temperature decreasing from 61. 58 days at 20 °C to 28. 94 days at 30 °C. The highest survival rate was observed at 25 °C (73 %). Male adult longevities were generally longer than that of females, except at 30 °C. The highest mean fecundity, age-stage specific fecundity and age-specific fecundity peak values were all observed at 27 °C. The maximum intrinsic rate of increase r and finite rate of increase λ were observed at 27 °C, while the maximum net reproduction rate R 0 was observed at 25 °C. The longest mean generation time occurred at 20 °C and the shortest at 27 °C. These results provide better understanding on the development, reproduction and dynamic of M. exigua populations, their distribution, and might be utilized to forecast and manage M. exigua outbreaks in China...|$|R

Two kinds of major lepidopteran pests in rice production, stemborers and <b>leaffolders,</b> cause severe yield loss in the most rice-producing countries. Bt toxic protein which are expressed by cry 1 Ac, cry 1 C * and cry 2 A * should be the most available methods to decrease the damage by these lepidopterans. To improve the rice resistance to insects, three Bt genes, i. e. cry 1 Ac, cry 1 C* and cry 2 A*, were introgressed to 9311 and Fuhui 838 from the donor parents, that are Minghui 63 (cry 1 C*), Minghui 63 (cry 2 A*), Minghui 63 (cry 1 Ac) respectively by molecular maker-assisted selection. The results showed that the improved lines got greatly resistance to the pests, and acquired good results of the agronomic traits.

50|$|Since crambids are {{relatively}} common throughout human settlements, the moths tend to affect crops and gardens, whether harmfully, beneficially or harmlessly. Beneficial crambids include the water hyacinth moth (Niphograpta albiguttalis), {{used to control}} its host (Eichhornia crassipes), the water veneer (Acentria ephemerella), a biocontrol agent used against Eurasian watermilfoil), and the bamboo borer (Omphisa fuscidentalis), of which the caterpillars are used for human consumption (see entomophagy). The mint moth (Pyrausta aurata) {{is an example of}} a harmless crambid. Crambid larvae are typically stem borers in plants of the grass family. As this family contains many important crops, some Crambidae species achieve pest status. The European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis is perhaps the best known; introduced to the United States in the early 1900s, it is now widespread in all but the westernmost states. Other pest species include the spotted stalk borer (Chilo partellus), the Asiatic rice borer (Chilo suppressalis), sod webworms (Crambus spp.), Duponchelia fovealis, the sugarcane borer (Diatraea saccharalis), bean pod borers (Maruca spp.), the rice white stemborer (Scirpophaga innotata), the southwestern corn borer (Diatraea grandiosella), and the grape <b>leaffolder</b> (Desmia maculalis).|$|E
40|$|Field andlaboratory {{studies on}} {{predation}} of rice <b>leaffolder</b> eggs (i. e., Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée) and Marasmia patnalis Bradley) {{were conducted to}} identify major predator species. Direct observations of predation on field-exposed eggs showed that in two seasons Metioche vittaticollis (Stål) and Anaxipha longipennis (Serville) were the major predators of <b>leaffolder</b> eggs. Together these crickets took the largest part of all eggs consumed during observation (92 €and had the highest ratio of visits with predation to their total observed visits to plants with <b>leaffolder</b> eggs. Furthermore, the activity pattern of the crickets matched best the daily pattern of egg disappearance, and the seasonal trends in their observed visits correlated best with the seasonal trends in egg disappearance. Minor predators feeding on field-exposed rice <b>leaffolder</b> eggs were Ophionea nigrofasciata Schmidt-Goebel, Micraspis sp., and Conocephalus longipennis (de Haan). The latter species was the most commonly observed egg predator, but had a negligible share in the total predation. In petri dish tests the consumption of <b>leaffolder</b> eggs by the predatory crickets M. vittaticollis and A. longipennis was far {{greater than that of}} four other predators. Female cricket adults consumed at least 80 eggs per day, and all individuals accepted <b>leaffolder</b> eggs as food. According to daily egg consumption and acceptance rates, the predators ranked as follows: M. vittaticollis, A. longipennis > Micraspis sp. > O. nigrofasciata > Paederus fuscipes Curtis, C. longipennis. Predator ranking according to the ratio of visits with predation to total visits in the field was identical to the ranking based on the egg consumption tests. Due to their large predation potential, predatory crickets will probably {{play an important role in}} <b>leaffolder</b> egg predation, even when their densities are low compared to those of other predator species...|$|E
40|$|Folding and {{spinning}} behavior of Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) in different categories of rice genotypes viz., resistant, susceptible, hybrid, scented, popular and wild rice genotypes were significantly different. Longer leaf selection time and folding time per primary fold; shorter primary fold and whole leaf fold; {{lower number of}} binds per primary fold and whole leaf fold were recorded in resistant and wild rice genotypes. In the correlation analysis, {{it was found that}} the leaf folding parameters were positively correlated to leaf folder damage whereas the leaf spinning parameters were negatively correlated. Similarly, the morphological characters differed significantly among the chosen genotypes and were related to <b>leaffolder</b> damage. The leaf width and total productive tiller number were positively correlated to <b>leaffolder</b> infestation. Results also indicated that the trichome density and length, leaf length and plant height might contribute to resistance whereas total number of green leaves had no effect on <b>leaffolder</b> infestation. In the scatter plot analysis between leaf folding {{and spinning}} characters and <b>leaffolder</b> damage, the genotypes were separated into four groups viz., resistant (TKM 6, Ptb 33, LFR 831311, Oryza rhizomatis and O. minuta), moderately resistant (ASD 16 and CORH 1), moderately susceptible (ADT 36, Pusa Basmati and CB 200290) and susceptible (IR 36 and TN 1). The present investigation proved that the leaf morphology viz., leaf length and width, plant height and trichome density and length may play a vital role in resistance against rice <b>leaffolder...</b>|$|E
40|$|Populations of rice leaffolders {{and their}} natural enemies were studied in eight crops of {{irrigated}} rice in Laguna Province, the Philippines. The rice <b>leaffolder</b> complex {{consisted of three}} species: Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée), Marasmia patnalis Bradley and M. exigua Butler. <b>Leaffolder</b> population dynamics were characterized by an egg peak at maximum tillering and a broad larval peak around booting stage. Peak densities ranged from 0. 2 to 2. 0 larvae per hill. Most larvae originated from immigrant moths {{and there was no}} substantial second generation. The seasonal percentage egg parasitism by Trichogramma sp. ranged from 0 to 27 °and percentage larval parasitism from 14 to 56 ÐThe braconid Macrocentrus philippinensis Ashmead was the most commonly reared larval parasitoid. Forty natural enemy taxa that may attack rice leaffolders were identified from suction and sweepnet samples: 24 predator taxa and 16 parasitoid taxa. The estimated survival rates from <b>leaffolder</b> egg to larval stages and between larval stages showed large variation between rice crops, but were not clearly correlated with observed levels of parasitism, natural enemy abundance, or natural enemy to <b>leaffolder</b> ratios. It is suggested that the generally low densities of rice leaffolders in Philippine transplanted rice are caused by their ovipositional preference for crops at the maximum tillering stage, allowing for only one generation, and by high immature mortality caused by the abundant and diverse complex of natural enemies...|$|E
40|$|Cage {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} quantify the predation rate of the cricket Metioche vittaticollis (Sta&ring;l) on the eggs of rice <b>leaffolder</b> Marasmia patnalis Bradley. Egg predation by adult females was measured in response to changes in egg density, predator density and leaf area per cage. The number of eggs consumed per predator increased with egg density, without reaching a plateau. The predation rate decreased with increasing leaf area. The functional response could be adequately described with a linear Type I model, with the effect of leaf area included. This type of response to <b>leaffolder</b> egg density means that predation was not limited by prey handling time or satiation, but by the search rate. The search rate is here interpreted as the leaf area effectively searched for <b>leaffolder</b> eggs by a single predator in one day. Estimated search rates averaged 0. 13 m 2 day - 1 for M. vittaticollis females. The search rate of the predators increased with prey density, but a model describing a density dependent search rate explained only 3 f the total variation in search rate. Increasing predator density per cage led to {{a decrease in the}} per capita egg predation rate when predator density was more than two per m 2 leaf area. Interference might thus reduce the potential to enhance <b>leaffolder</b> egg predation by conservation or augmentation of predatory cricket population...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} nitrogenous-fertilization on the {{population}} dynamics and natural control of rice leaffolders was studied in an irrigated rice area in the Philippines. Nitrogen was applied at three levels (0, 75 and 150 kg N ha- 1), {{and its impact on}} crop growth and yield, arthropod abundance, and rates of <b>leaffolder</b> parasitism and survival was assessed with weekly samples. Rice plants were taller and had a higher leaf nitrogen content with increasing levels of nitrogenous fertilization, but grain yield was highest at the medium nitrogen level. Herbivores, predators, and parasitoids increased in abundance with nitrogenous-fertilization level. The average density of rice <b>leaffolder</b> larvae at the highest nitrogen level was eight times the density at zero nitrogen level, and the peak percentage injured leaves increased from 5 to 35 &Eth;The strong increase in larval density was due to the positive effect of nitrogenous-fertilization on egg recruitment and survival of medium-sized larvae. The percentage parasitism of eggs and larvae was not affected by nitrogenous-fertilization. The increase in survival of medium-sized larvae with nitrogen levels was associated with lower predator to <b>leaffolder</b> ratios. The strong effect of nitrogenous-fertilization in the present small-scale experiment was attributed mainly to allowing the moths an oviposition choice between plots with different application levels of nitrogen. Therefore it is hypothesized that the effect of increasing nitrogenous-fertilization level on <b>leaffolder</b> larval densities will be less pronounced when implemented over a large area...|$|E

The changes of various biochemical constituents such as leaf soluble protein, phenol, ortho-dihydroxy phenol, tannin and enzymes viz., peroxidase, phenyl alanine ammonia lyase (PAL) were assessed spectrophotometrically in all the rice genotypes before and after RLF infestation. The protein profile was analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulphate-poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method. A significant constituent of biochemical content such as tannin, phenol and ortho-dihydroxy phenol has been increased along with enzyme activities of peroxidase and PAL in the infested resistant (Ptb 33, TKM 6 and LFR 831311) and wild rice genotypes (Oryza minuta and O. rhizomatis). A decrease in leaf protein content was evident invariably in all the infested rice genotypes. It is also evident that the contents of biochemicals such as phenol, ortho-dihydroxy phenol and tannin were negatively correlated with <b>leaffolder</b> damage. However, leaf protein content was positively correlated with the damage by rice <b>leaffolder.</b> SDS-PAGE analysis for total protein profiling of healthy and C. medinalis-infested genotypes revealed the enhanced expression of a high molecular weight (> 97 kDa) protein in all the genotypes. Besides, there was also an increased induction of a 38 kDa protein in C. medinalis infested resistant genotypes, which was absent in uninfested plants.

These findings indicate that damaged rice plants gradually recover, with an increase in the DI for WRARR. The above results were demonstrated by biochemical tests. Therefore, the sequential infestation of the two pest species and their DIs should be considered for integrated pest management (IPM) and control strategies for rice pests...|$|E

Also, {{there are a}} variety of user-friendly forms of bioformulation products, including dusts (DP), granules (GR), wettable powders (WP), oil dispersions (OD), and liquid formulations (Knowles 2005). The WP formulation of B. licheniformis (N 1 E) mixed with corn starch and olive oil was evaluated against tomato gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea in both artificial and natural infection settings, and the results showed that spraying of WP formulation mixed with a 100 -fold diluted N 1 E was found to be the most effective approach (Lee et al. 2006). Furthermore, B. thuringiensis Berliner (B.t.) mixed with water-soluble granular formulation was evaluated against the rice <b>leaffolder,</b> Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee, and the results showed that the first spraying of the formulation containing 2.5  kg/ha B.t. led to the lowest <b>leaffolder</b> damage at only 8.21  % after 7  days and also the highest grain yield at 28. 58  kg/plot (Kandibane et al. 2010). Currently, several entomopathogenic bacteria have received much attention as biological control agents. Xenorhabdus spp. are gram-negative bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae and symbiotically associate with entomopathogenic nematodes of the family Steinernematidae (Boemare et al. 1993; Forst et al. 1997). A complex cooperation between these bacteria and their nematodes leads to severe toxicity to many insect species (Akhurst 1983; Herbert and Goodrich-Blair 2007; Herbert Tran et al. 2009). When the nematodes infest their insect hosts, they release the symbiotic bacteria from their intestinal tracts into the insect host’s hemocoel, and this action usually results in the death of insect hosts within 48  h, most likely due to the combined actions of bacterial multiplication, septicemia, and secretion of toxins (Bowen and Ensign 1998; Sicard et al. 2004; Yang et al. 2012). Cell suspensions and cell-free supernatants of Xenorhabdus spp. have been shown to be highly effective under laboratory conditions for controlling of several insect pests, such as Plutella xylostella L. (Abdel-Razek 2003; Mahar et al. 2008), Hopila philanthus (Fuessly) (Ansari et al. 2003), Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), Thrips tabaci (Lindeman) (Gerritsen et al. 2005), Galleria mellonella L. (Mahar et al. 2005), Spodoptera exgua (Hubner), Otiorhynchus sulcatus (Fabricius), Schistocerca gregaria (Forskal) (Mahar et al. 2008), and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Shresth and Kim 2010). Moreover, Bussaman et al. (2009) reported that application with Xenorhabdus nematophila and Photorhabdus luminescens caused the highest mortality of Luciaphorus perniciosus Rack, a mushroom mite, at 85 and 83  %, respectively. The cell suspension of X. nematophila that was cultivated for 48  h at the concentration of 1  ×  108 cells/ml was found to cause the maximum mortality of L. perniciosus (85 – 88  %) and reduction of fecundity of its offspring (22.84  %). Moreover, the different parts of X. stokiae isolate PB 09 culture (whole cell suspension, cell-free supernatant and crude cell extract) were also evaluated and the results showed that cell-free supernatant of X. stokiae PB 09 was the most effective to control mushroom mite, resulting in miticidal activities at 89  % (Bussaman et al. 2012). Nonetheless, the efficacy of Xenorhabdus spp. bacteria in the form of bioformulations has yet been explored. This is important to understand the suitable bioformulation forms of Xenorhabdus spp. before proceeding to the field experiments (Suprapta 2012). Therefore, in this study, X.|$|E
40|$|The insect-repellent {{qualities of}} oil {{extracted}} from {{the fruit of the}} neem tree, and of cake from its residue after pressing, are being studied at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). This is part of a program me to develop biological pesticides that cause no ecological damage and scientists in several countries are cooperating with IRRI. Farmers in India, where neem is a native species, have long protected their crops with extracts of both its fruit and leaves. Scientists have discovered that neem derivatives repel 123 species of insects, including pests of stored grain. Neem oil and residues consist of a complex array of chemicals which exhibit diverse behavioural and physiological effects on insects. IRRI studies show that insects feed less, grow poorly and lay fewer eggs on pest-susceptible rice plants that have been sprayed with neem oil. Effects are similar with sucking insects, such as the brown planthopper, and chewing insects such as the rice <b>leaffolder</b> and the ear-eating caterpillar. In IRRI tests, five applications of a 25 % neem oil emulsion sprayed with an ultra-low-volume applicator at 4 I/ha adequately protected a rice crop. Neem cake applied to rice fields has reduced nitrogen loss in experiments in India and at IRRI and neem may also encourage nitrogen fixation in rice.

40|$|Silicon (Si) is {{important}} in plant defenses that operate in a direct manner against herbivores, and work in rice (Oryza sativa) has established that this is mediated by the jasmonate signaling pathway. Plant defenses also operate indirectly, by the production of herbivore induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that attract predators and parasitoids of herbivores. These indirect defenses too are mediated by the jasmonate pathway but no earlier work has demonstrated an effect of Si on HIPVs. In this study, we tested the effect of Si supplementation versus Si deprivation to rice plants on subsequent HIPV production following feeding by the important pest, rice <b>leaffolder</b> (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis). Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analyses showed lower production of α-bergamotene, β-sesquiohellandrene, hexanal 2 -ethyl, and cedrol from +Si herbivore-infested plants compared with -Si infested plants. These changes in plant chemistry were ecologically significant in altering {{the extent to which}} parasitoids were attracted to infested plants. Adult females of Trathala flavo-orbitalis and Microplitis mediator both exhibited greater attraction to the HIPV blend of +Si plants infested with their respective insect hosts compared to -Si infested plants. In equivalent studies using RNAi rice plants in which jasmonate perception was silenced there was no equivalent change to the HIPV blend associated with Si treatment; indicating that the effects of Si on HIPVs are modulated by the jasmonate pathway. Further, this work demonstrates that silicon alters the HIPV blend of herbivore-infested rice plants. The significance of this finding is that there are no earlier-published studies of this phenomenon in rice or any other plant species. Si treatment to crops offers scope for enhancing induced, indirect defenses and associated biological control of pests because parasitoids are more strongly attracted by the HIPVs produced by +Si plants...|$|E
