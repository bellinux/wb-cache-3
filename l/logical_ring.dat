This paper identifies some interesting problems in mobile group communications regarding dynamic group membership due to member joining and leaving, dynamic locations due to node mobility, and dynamic networks due to node/link failures. These problems are solved by proposing a ring-based hierarchy of proxies with bi-directional tokens. The proposed hierarchy is a combination of <b>logical</b> <b>rings</b> and <b>logical</b> trees, which takes advantage of the simplicity of <b>logical</b> <b>rings</b> and the scalability of logical trees.

In {{order to deal with}} the scalability and reliability issues for group communication services in such a network environment, many existing protocols divide the whole group into subgroups and organize them into a tree-based hierarchy. A special node in each subgroup is responsible for collecting acknowledgement messages and locally retransmitting lost messages within the subgroup. However, the tree-based hierarchy has the single point of failure problem, which may seriously affect the performance of group communications. We propose a RingNet hierarchy of proxies that is a combination of logical trees and <b>logical</b> <b>rings.</b> The proposed hierarchy has the self-organization property because it can heal itself as quickly as possible in the presence of failures.

It is therefore critical that lightpaths are routed in such a way that a single link failure would not disconnect the network. We call such a routing survivable and develop algorithms for survivable routing of a logical topology. First, we show that the survivable routing problem is NP-complete. We then prove necessary and sufficient conditions for a routing to be survivable and use these conditions to formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). Due to the excessive run-times of the ILP, we develop simple and effective relaxations for the ILP that significantly reduce the time required for finding survivable routings.
