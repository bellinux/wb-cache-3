60|$|Pretty {{soon they}} came to a nice mossy green log right across the Lone Little Path. Peter Rabbit stopped and sat up very {{straight}}. He looked this <b>way</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Johnny Chuck stopped too and he sat up very straight and looked this <b>way</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> but all he could see was the mossy green log across the Lone Little Path.|$|R

6000|$|The man nodded. [...] "It <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> now, but {{you wait}} until I've fixed things up," [...] said he. [...] "Then {{if you feel like}} walking eight miles I'll go on with you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> But {{you must}} not go away without giving me another chance to talk with you. Will you promise that?" [...] he demanded, abruptly, passionately. [...] "I have {{something}} to say to you." ...|$|E
60|$|What did it mean? Had Captain Hannock smelt a {{mouse and}} thus sought to outwit Mr. Ranson? It {{certainly}} <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Chug-a-rum?" [...] said Grandfather Frog, {{and looked}} this <b>way</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Then {{he gave a}} funny hop and turned about in the {{opposite}} direction and looked this <b>way</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> but all he saw was the Smiling Pool dimpling and smiling, Mrs. Redwing bringing a fat worm to her hungry little babies in their snug nest in the bulrushes, and the Merry Little Breezes hurrying over to see what the trouble might be.|$|R
60|$|Both governess and pupil {{were close}} to the summer-house before they <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and noticed Midwinter {{standing}} inside. The governess saw him first.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> to Doby too, I guess," [...] said Mr. Bascom, with {{a glance}} of {{contempt}} at the general; [...] "he's lost about fifteen pounds to-day. Did Hilary send you down here?" [...] he demanded.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mrs. Bell, I only asked {{because every}} one {{thinks it is}} strange he doesn't--and an elder, of all people. It {{looks as if he}} didn't think himself a Christian, you know. Of course, we all know better, but it <b>LOOKS</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> If I was you, I'd tell him folks was talking about it. Mr. Bentley says it is {{hindering}} the full success of the meetings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know; it <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> {{at first}} sight," [...] said the sailor, nodding his head; [...] "but those as knows the {{least have a}} habit of thinkin' they know {{all there is to}} know, while them as knows the most admits what a turr'ble big world this is.

6000|$|Then Johnny Chuck looked this <b>way</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> to be {{sure that}} no one was listening. Finally he whispered in Jimmy Skunk's ear: ...|$|R

Everything <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> to me." ...|$|E
60|$|There is a {{most unusual}} feature about that dispute: the nine persons who decided alike, quoted not a single {{authority}} in support of their position. I do not know when I have seen trained disputants do the like of that before. The nine merely furnished their own opinions, founded upon--nothing at all. In the other dispute ("Did Jesus anywhere claim to be God?") {{the same kind of}} men--trained and learned clergymen--backed up their arguments with chapter and verse. On both sides. Plenty of verses. Were no reinforcing verses {{to be found in the}} present case? It <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> ma'am, {{but really}} it aint," [...] replied the girl. [...] "It {{seemed to me}} as if it would be a mercy to both of 'em to have the thing settled. So I cleared away a place in front of the wood-shed and unchained Lord Edward, and then I opened the kitchen door and called the bull. Out he came, with his teeth a-showin', and his blood-shot eyes, and his crooked front legs. Like lightnin' from the mount'in blast, he made one bounce for the big dog, and oh! what a fight there was! They rolled, they gnashed, they knocked over the wood-horse and sent chips a-flyin' all ways at wonst. I thought Lord Edward would whip in a minute or two; but he didn't, for the bull stuck to him like a burr, and they was havin' it, ground and lofty, when I hears some one run up behind me, and turnin' quick, there was the 'Piscopalian minister, 'My! my! my!' he hollers; 'what a awful spectacle! Aint there no way of stoppin' it?' 'No, sir,' says I, and I told him how I didn't want to stop it, and the reason why. Then says he, 'Where's your master?' and I told him how you was away. 'Isn't there any man at all about?' says he. 'No,' says I. 'Then,' says he, 'if there's nobody else to stop it, I must do it myself.' An' he took off his coat. 'No,' says I, 'you keep back, sir. If there's anybody to plunge into that erena, the blood be mine;' an' I put my hand, without thinkin', ag'in his black shirt-bosom, to hold him back; but he didn't notice, bein' so excited. 'Now,' says I, 'jist wait one minute, and you'll see that bull's tail go between his legs. He's weakenin'.' An' sure enough, Lord Edward got a good grab at him, and was a-shakin' the very life out of him, when I run up and took Lord Edward by the collar. 'Drop it!' says I, and he dropped it, for he know'd he'd whipped, and he was pretty tired hisself. Then the bull-dog, he trotted off with his tail a-hangin' down. 'Now, then,' says I, 'them dogs will be bosom friends forever after this.' 'Ah me!' says he, 'I'm sorry indeed that your employer, for who I've always had a great respect, should allow you to get into such habits.' That made me feel real bad, and I told him, mighty quick, that you was the last man in the world to let me do {{anything}} like that, and that, if you'd 'a' been here, you'd 'a' separated them dogs, if they'd a-chawed your arms off; that you was very particular about such things; {{and that it would be}} a pity if he was to think you was a dog-fightin' gentleman, when I'd often heard you say that, now you was fixed an' settled, the one thing you would like most would be to be made a vestryman." ...|$|E

50|$|The film {{opens with}} a young child {{climbing}} into a bullock cart and insisting that he also go with the cart {{to pick up the}} 'Shavundi' - a person who performs funeral rites and lives amongst the cremation grounds. Though essential to the funeral ceremonies, he is often considered frightening or unlucky. He certainly <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> too - covered in ash and grime, sleeping in a bat-infested grove and given ominous background music. The 'Shavundi' and child begin talking in the cart ride to the funeral, and then a flashback takes us to meet Lakshmi.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1996 review, Janet Maslin lauded the [...] "sleek young Stones in {{all their}} insolent glory {{presiding}} over this uneven but ripely nostalgic show"; although [...] "rumor had it that the Stones... thought they looked tired and felt upstaged by the high-energy Who", [...] "it hardly <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> as Mick Jagger's fabulous performance nearly turns this into a one-man show."

40|$|The EU IST- 10303 “eConstruct ” {{project is}} {{developing}} an XML Vocabulary and Grammar for the Building and Construction (BC) industry, {{together with a}} number of applications of this vocabulary. The vocabulary- called bcXML (from building and construction XML) - supports eCommerce and eBusiness in BC, both nationally and over the borders of the different European member states. Especially the communication of meaning over the national borders is of crucial importance for the future usage of the Internet as a means to increase the industry's competitiveness, its ability to co-operate, reduce cost of failure, and stimulate the European market of BC products, services and business. This paper presents the current (March 2001) status of bcXML; what it looks like, why it <b>looks</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and what the BC industry can expect of it.
