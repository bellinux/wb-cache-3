In static <b>line</b> <b>progression,</b> more jumps are required to experience freefall, but the jumps are less expensive for the student as one instructor can dispatch multiple students per load and students are initially dispatched from lower altitudes. Under accelerated freefall, one or sometimes two instructors are dedicated just to one student.|$|E
50|$|A {{static line}} is a cord {{attached}} at {{one end to the}} aircraft and at the other end {{to the top of the}} jumper's 'D-Bag' (Deployment Bag, into which the canopy is packed). The parachutist's fall from the aircraft causes the static line to become taut, this then pulls the D-Bag out of the container on the jumper's back. The static line and D-Bag stay with the aircraft as the jumper leaves, and is pulled back into the aircraft by the dispatcher. Now free of its D-Bag, the canopy is allowed to inflate as the jumper continues to fall. Effectively, the jumper drags the parachute behind him, causing the upward-rushing wind to force open and inflate the canopy. The canopy should inflate and begin supporting the jumper within 4 seconds. In the unlikely event of a malfunction, students are taught how to cut away the main canopy and deploy the reserve chute. The aim of static <b>line</b> <b>progression</b> is to train students to maintain the correct, stable body position upon exiting the aircraft, and to teach how to deploy the canopy via the pilot chute mechanism.|$|E

40|$|Checkpointing and {{rollback}} recovery are {{techniques that}} can provide efficient recovery from transient process failures. In a message-passing system, the rollback of a message sender may cause the rollback of the corresponding receiver, and the system needs to roll back to a consistent set of checkpoints called recovery line. If the processes are allowed to take uncoordinated checkpoints, the above rollback propagation may result in the domino effect which prevents recovery <b>line</b> <b>progression.</b> Traditionally, only obsolete checkpoints before the global recovery line can be discarded, and the necessary and sufficient condition for identifying all garbage checkpoints has remained an open problem. A necessary and sufficient condition for achieving optimal garbage collection is derived and it is proved {{that the number of}} useful checkpoints is bounded by N(N+ 1) / 2, where N is the number of processes. The approach is based on the maximum-sized antichain model of consistent global checkpoints and the technique of recovery line transformation and decomposition. It is also shown that, for systems requiring message logging to record in-transit messages, the same approach can be used to achieve optimal message log reclamation. As a final topic, a unifying framework is described by considering checkpoint coordination and exploiting piecewise determinism as mechanisms for bounding rollback propagation, and the applicability of the optimal garbage collection algorithm to domino-free recovery protocols is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} one of the most {{challenging}} global medical issues today. In 2011, prostate cancer was the most diagnosed malignancy in the United States, making up 29 % of new cancer cases. In that year it was the second leading cause of cancer related deaths among men in the USA and the second most common cause of cancer related death overall from the EU. The prostate remains, however, an under studied organ, making insights into the anatomy and biology of prostate cancer difficult to achieve. After 30 years, PSA screening of men of the appropriate age is still the first step in prostate cancer diagnosis, usually followed by a manual prostate exam which may lead to a transrectal biopsy. This study makes use of Next Generation Sequencing to successfully identify a superior miRNA based urinary assay for the detection of prostate cancer. A receiver operating curve AUC of 0. 90 was achieved for patients vs. non-patients using an additive risk model defined by empirically derived critical threshold values of eight urinary miRNAs identified with this method. This is superior to the PSA blood test’s AUC of 0. 66 which illustrates that a miRNA profile such as this has the potential to surpass protein biomarkers such as PSA in terms of specificity and sensitivity. It was also demonstrated that a geometric mean of three urinary miRNAs were useful for endogenous normalization. One significant risk factor for prostate cancer is being African American. Again using Next Generation Sequencing technology, we have established a miRNA expression profile for the stages of a prostate cancer cell <b>line</b> <b>progression</b> model derived from the normal prostate epithelium of an African American man. Normal prostate epithelium was immortalized only with SV 40 large T antigen (P 69) and passaged three times in nude mice, producing the highly aggressive and metastatic M 12 cell line. The M 2182 cell line is an intermediate between the P 69 s and M 12 s having only been passaged twice and not yet having acquired metastatic potential. The F 6 cell line was derived by reintroducing a copy of chromosome 19 missing from the M 12 cell line via microcell mediated chromosome transfer. These profiles show a large downregulation of miRNAs early in tumorigenesis (from P 69 toM 2182) affecting the DLK 1 -DIO 3 megacluster and the miR- 200 family. The later acquisition of metastatic potential (from M 2182 to M 12) is concomitant with the upregulation of specific miRNAs including the HOX gene miRNAs miR- 10 a and miR- 196 and miR- 9. Thus, the analysis of this progression model has uncovered relevant miRs and genes the dysregulation of which contribute to prostate tumorigenesis...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: To {{perform a}} {{cost-effectiveness}} analysis of follicular lymphoma maintenance treatment after first-line induction with rituximab compared to observation in Portugal. Methods: A Markov follicular lymphoma model was developed with four health states: progression free survival on {{first and second}} <b>lines,</b> <b>progression</b> and death. The transition probabilities between health states {{were obtained from the}} PRIMA and EORTC 20981 clinical trials and the health states utilities from the literature. The analysis considered the Portuguese National Health Service perspective and includes only direct costs. Resource consumption was estimated by a Portuguese clinical expert panel. The unit costs (€ in 2014) were estimated using Portuguese official databases. Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were performed. Results: In the base case, for a time horizon of 10 years, the cost per life year gained and per quality-adjusted life-year were € 10, 634 and € 10, 664, respectively. The sensitivity analyses confirmed the stability of the base case for time horizons of 20 and 30 years, varying between € 7, 430 and € 7, 155. Maintenance with rituximab is cost-effective for a time horizon of 5. 5 years (cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained of € 23, 616).

40|$|Monitoring wild cervid {{populations have}} become a {{priority}} for management. However, accurate and reliable estimates of densities are difficult to achieve since they may be affected by environmental variation, species behaviour or observational issues. Therefore, to obtain unbiased estimates of densities {{it is necessary to}} adopt sampling methods that quantify the probability to detect the target species. In this study, we compare the results of roe deer sampling based on distance detection performed by two techniques: surveys on foot in the evening and nocturnal surveys by car. Estimates of roe deer population densities were conducted in Sierra de Guadarrama (Madrid, Spain). Distance sampling was conducted along tracks in 10 pine forests in October. Observations from the surveys done on foot were better fitted with detection functions, although this technique required more days and more observers for its realization, hence increasing field effort. Nocturnal surveys by car were also a proper technique and decreased distance sampling costs, since only three people were needed for 6 days to carry them out. However, observations obtained with this technique showed an imbalance in the detection function in the first few metres. This model was limited by the small number of roe deer observed in or near the <b>line</b> of <b>progression.</b> This is a handicap because functions used by the Distance software assume that the highest probability of detecting specimens is in the <b>line</b> of <b>progression,</b> causing an imbalance in the detection function at zero distance. To compensate for this, data were lefttruncated at 20 m. Therefore, when it is necessary to estimate absolute densities of roe deer populations, nocturnal distance sampling by car seems to be the most appropriate method due to its low cost, yet the influence of the vehicle on the distribution of roe deer and, therefore, on the estimated density, {{must be taken into account}} when carrying out such studie...|$|R

40|$|Nestin is an {{intermediate}} filament protein and {{a marker of}} neuroectodermal stem cells indicating multipotentiality and regenerative capability. In melanoma tissues, nestin re-expression was correlated with tumor progression. Activation of the nestin neural enhancer was shown {{to be dependent on}} the binding of class III POU transcription factors, with brain- 2 (BRN 2) suggested to play a key role. We found both nestin and BRN 2 mRNA in almost all of 13 analyzed melanoma cell <b>lines</b> of different <b>progression</b> stages, but expression levels did not correlate. Nestin protein was detected in 11 of 13 and BRN 2 protein in 7 of 13 melanoma cell <b>lines</b> independent of <b>progression</b> stage. Downregulation of BRN 2 by small-interfering RNA did not alter nestin expression in melanoma cells. However, POU proteins, such as BRN 2, commonly cooperate with transcription factors of the Sry-box (SOX) family by binding to a nearby DNA site necessary for their action. SOX 9 and SOX 10 {{have been shown to be}} expressed in melanocyte precursors, with SOX 10 downregulated upon differentiation. We now demonstrate SOX 9 and SOX 10 protein expression in melanoma tissues and cell lines. Downregulation of SOX 9 and of SOX 10 markedly decreased nestin levels in melanoma cells in a cooperative manner. Thus, SOX 9 and SOX 10 but not BRN 2 seem to be required for nestin expression in human melanoma...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} healing of wounds in cardiac valves, histologic and ultrastructural studies were {{performed}} in the mitral valves of 10 sheep in which a 1 cm long, radially oriented incision had been made {{at the center of}} the free edge of the anterior mitral leaflet. Two types of granulation tissue (GT) were associated with healing of these wounds. The first covered the cut edge and consisted of myxomatous tissue that extended from the valvular spongiosa and fibrosa. Maturation of collagen, with formation of thick bundles of fibrils progressed for up to 16 weeks in this tissue, extending from the basal portion of the wound toward the free edge of the leaflet. The second type of GT resembled that seen in areas of reactive fibrosis in regurgitant mitral valves. It was found predominantly on the ventricular surfaces of the leaflets, also extending from their basal portion. At 4 – 5 weeks, fibroblasts were the only cellular components of GT. Parallel arrays of myofibroblasts were found after 8 weeks. The GT also contained a network of proteoglycan granules, which were more abundant in the ventricular side and increased in amount up to the 12 th week, decreasing thereafter. The cut surface was relined by growth and spreading of endothelial cells from both sides of the leaflet. This process began at the most basal region of the wound and was completed at 8 weeks. Neovascularization was observed in the basal regions of the wounds at 12 weeks. The new vascular structures sprouted from vessels normally present in the spongiosa along the vaßlve ring, and initially consisted of cords of endothelial cells that were surrounded by basement membranes, pericytes and some elastic fibers, but lacked distinct lumina. At 16 weeks, similar vessels extended along the distal area of the wound. In conclusion, {{the healing of}} mitral valvular wounds is a slow process that requires 8 – 12 weeks forthe formation of a dense collagenous scar at the edges and complete restoration of the endothelial <b>lining.</b> <b>Progression</b> of healing is associated with the phenotypic modulation of connective tissue cells from fibroblast to myofibroblasts and neovascularization of the valvular spongiosa...|$|R

40|$|Whereas {{the tumor}} acidic {{extracellular}} pH plays {{a crucial role}} in the invasive process, the mechanism(s) behind this acidification, especially in low nutrient conditions, are unclear. The regulation of the Na(+) /H(+) exchanger (NHE) and invasion by serum deprivation were studied in a series of breast epithelial cell <b>lines</b> representing <b>progression</b> from non-tumor to highly metastatic cells. Whereas serum deprivation reduced lactate production in all three cells lines, it inhibited NHE activity in the non-tumor cells and stimulated it in the tumor cells with a larger stimulation in the metastatic cells. The stimulation of NHE in the tumor cell lines was the result of an increased affinity of the internal H(+) regulatory site of the NHE without changes in sodium kinetics or expression. Serum deprivation conferred increased cell motility and invasive ability that were abrogated by specific inhibition of the NHE. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3 -kinase by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant or wortmannin incubation inhibited NHE activity and invasion in serum replete conditions while potentiating the serum deprivation-dependent activation of the NHE and invasion. These results indicate that the up-regulation of the NHE by a phosphoinositide 3 -kinase-dependent mechanism plays an essential role in increased tumor cell invasion induced by serum deprivation. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
