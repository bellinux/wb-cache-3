40|$|Achieving ‘a social <b>licence</b> to operate’ is {{important}} for organisations with long time horizons, high exposure to global markets and {{with a wide range}} of interested stakeholders. Community engagement is critical to achieve a social <b>licence</b> to operate, but its capacity to influence social <b>licence</b> is not well understood. Using case studies from forestry in New Brunswick, Canada and Tasmania, Australia, this article considers what social <b>licence</b> is, how community engagement plays a role in achieving social <b>licence</b> and how an alternative conceptualisation of social <b>licence</b> may improve the influence of community engagement in achieving a social <b>licence</b> to operate. Social <b>licence</b> is often conceived of as a single <b>licence</b> granted by a ‘community’. We argue that social <b>licence</b> is better conceptualised as a continuum of multiple <b>licences</b> achieved across various levels of society. Viewed in this way, we can consider what is needed to achieve social <b>licences</b> at given points along that continuum, and identify the strengths and weaknesses of specific engagement techniques in achieving particular social <b>licence...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Milton then {{argues that}} Parliament's {{licensing}} order will fail in its purpose to suppress scandalous, seditious, and libellous books: [...] "this order of <b>licencing</b> conduces {{nothing to the}} end {{for which it was}} fram'd". The order was meant to rectify manners by preventing the spread of an [...] "infection" [...] caused by bad books. Milton objects, arguing that the licensing order is too sweeping, because even the Bible itself had been historically limited to readers for containing offensive descriptions of blasphemy and wicked men. Milton also points out that Parliament will not protect the ignorant from bad books by this Order, because the books would more likely have been read by the learned anyhow. Furthermore, whatever bad ideas were written can still be taught through word of mouth or otherwise, so [...] "infection" [...] or corruption is not prevented. Milton’s point is that licensing books cannot possibly prevent societal corruption (it is [...] "far insufficient to the end which it intends"), so there is no viable stopping point: [...] "If we think to regulat Printing, thereby to rectifie manners, we must regulat all recreations and pastimes, all that is delightful to man". Finally, Milton also points out that, if there are even licensers fit for making these judgments, then the possibility of error in licensing books is still great, and {{the amount of time that}} the job would take is impractical.|$|E

40|$|Driver <b>licencing</b> is an {{important}} part of life for many Australian, especially those who live in outer urban areas or regional and remote parts of the country where public transport is not accessible. With increasingly difficult graduated licensing systems for new drivers, aimed at keeping young drivers safe, there can be substantial barriers to licensing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. However, little is understood about the population rates of driver <b>licencing</b> for Aboriginal and Torres Strait people, or the barriers to <b>licencing.</b> This lack of data inhibits development of appropriate programs.
