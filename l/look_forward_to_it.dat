2500|$|Being on {{the radio}} is nice – it's like hanging out again, fooling about and talking rubbish. I really enjoy it and <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> every week." [...] – Adam Buxton ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing {{may happen}} {{to prevent the}} ball. What a {{disappointment}} it would be! I do <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> I own, with very great pleasure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a good boy. I shouldn't {{like you}} to do that. You'll {{get a little bit}} of money when I pass away, but you mustn't <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> It wouldn't profit you if you did." ...|$|E
60|$|I'm <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> I {{think in}} some past life I {{must have been a}} lizard.|$|R
60|$|GEOFFREY [He {{holds her}} at arms' length--looking {{into her eyes}} and smiling.] I believe you are <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> very much, {{but he will}} be asleep, and you won't see his pretty ways and his earnest dark eyes.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Herminia bent her head. [...] "You {{misunderstand}} me," [...] she replied. [...] "I don't {{mean to say}} I {{will never}} fall in love. I expect to do that. I <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> frankly,--it is a woman's place in life. I only mean to say, I don't think anything will ever induce me to marry,--that is to say, legally." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, I know!" [...] {{said his}} wife. [...] "I {{think of those}} things, too, Basil. Life isn't what it seems when you <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> But I think people would suffer less, and wouldn't have to work so hard, and could make all {{reasonable}} provision for the future, {{if they were not}} so greedy and so foolish." ...|$|E
6000|$|It is his humour too, to {{say that}} he does not look forward to going out; that he is not glad the time is drawing near; that he did <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> once, but that was very long ago; that he has lost all care for everything. It is his humour to be a helpless, crushed, and broken man. And, Heaven be his witness that he has his humour {{thoroughly}} gratified! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May I {{not stay}} a little longer, Sibby," [...] said Clement, rather piteously, [...] "to hear Lance sing? I have been <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> all day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall end there, you know, Aaron," [...] Maraton sighed. [...] "I am not <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> It's a queer {{sort of a}} {{hothouse}} for a man." ...|$|R
50|$|One notable {{victim of}} the hangings was a 17-year-old Erdal Eren, who said he <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> in order <b>to</b> avoid {{thinking}} of the torture he had witnessed.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} talk {{me out of}} it, my dears," [...] said Mrs. Langford. [...] "I know it is right, and it shall be done. It is only the making up my mind that was the struggle, and I shall <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> as much as either of you, when I know {{it is to be}} done. Now walk off, my dears, and do not let that letter be too late for the post." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{was fifteen}} I talked in italics and {{superlatives}} too," [...] said Miss Oliver sarcastically. [...] "I think the party {{promises to be}} pleasant for young fry. I expect to be bored. None of those boys will bother dancing with an old maid like me. Jem and Walter will take me out once out of charity. So you can't expect me to <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> with your touching young rapture." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} {{singular}} {{if it was}} not," [...] said Mrs. Saltillo dryly; [...] "and as I believe {{it is by no}} means an uncommon fact in human nature, it seems to me strange that people should insist upon it as a discovery. It is an inheritance, however, that in due time progress and science will no doubt interrupt, to the advancement of the human race. I need not say that both Enriquez and myself <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> with confident tranquillity." ...|$|E
60|$|FANNY. No, I {{want you}} to go, dear. Your aunts are <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> I shall get over it all the sooner with {{everybody}} out of the way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, damn the expense. Think how I've been <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Don't {{you know}} what <b>it</b> means <b>to</b> me? I've never loved anyone but you. I never shall." ...|$|R
60|$|She gave me her hand. I stammered {{something}} about the pleasure I felt in seeing her again, and about my having <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> for a long, long time.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes!' cried Bella, in high glee, choking him again. 'He's the Knave of Wilfers! Dear Pa, {{the lovely}} woman means {{to look forward}} to this fortune that has been told for her, so delightfully, and to cause it to make her a much better lovely woman than she ever has been yet. What the little fair man is {{expected}} to do, sir, is to <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> also, by saying to himself when he is in danger of being over-worried, [...] "I see land at last!" ...|$|E
6000|$|While, as we journeyed on, I {{gradually}} dwelt less on how piteous {{my arrival}} {{would be for}} myself, and thought {{more and more of}} its sadness for the poor old Marquis who had loved his nephew so much, till, instead of merely fearing to reach Nid de Merle, I began to <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> and consider how to comfort the poor old man; for had not my husband begged me to be the staff of his old age, and to fill a daughter's place to him? ...|$|E
60|$|Yes. We {{must have}} a few books, and {{everything}} that is idle, sauntering, and enjoyable. We must lie {{down at the bottom}} of those boats, and devise all kinds of engines for improving on that gallant holiday. I see myself in a striped shirt, moustache, blouse, red sash, straw hat, and white trousers, sitting astride a mule, and not caring for the clock, the day of the month, or the week. Tinkling bells upon the mule, I hope. I <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> day and night, and wish the time were come. Don't you give it up. That's all.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the picnic}} this afternoon, too!" [...] she sighed. [...] "I've <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> all summer. And it's a perfect day--and I've {{got to stay}} here and nurse this foot." ...|$|R
60|$|Dick was not {{a gambler}} and did not play many games, but he wanted a little excitement, and he <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> as he {{followed}} his cousin up the drive.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘That’s my dear brother!’ She {{kissed his}} hand in a little rapture. ‘The dear girls will be dreadfully disappointed,’ added Rosa, laughing, with the dewdrops glistening in her bright eyes. ‘They have <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> so, poor pets!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{do not see}} how you {{can expect}} men to like 'The Sybarites'," [...] she said, with some heat; [...] "very few men realize or care to realize what a small chance the average woman has. I know {{marriage}} isn't a necessary goal, but most women, as well as most men, <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> at some time of life, and, as a rule, a woman is forced to take her choice of the two or three men that offer themselves, no matter what they are. I admire a man who takes up the cudgels for women, as he has done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You well know, Victor, {{that our}} union {{had been the}} {{favourite}} plan of your parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and taught to <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> as an event that would certainly take place. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truth--Do you not love another? ...|$|E
60|$|We are {{planning}} a retreat into the mountains--into Giotto's country, the Casentino--where we are to find a villa for almost nothing, and shall have our letters sent daily from Florence, together with books and newspapers. I <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> with joy. We promise one another to be industrious à faire frémir, {{so as to make}} the pleasure lawful. Little Penini walks about, talking of 'mine villa,' anxiously hoping that 'some boys' may not have pulled all the flowers before he gets there. He boasts, with considerable complacency, that 'a table in Pallis says I am four years,' though the fact doesn't strike him as extraordinary.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, my dear," [...] she said, [...] "think how {{necessary}} it is. For {{the first}} time, {{in my life}} I am absolutely <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> I never thought that I should live to associate romance with that ugly, brown-stone building." ...|$|R
50|$|Another teacher, Mr. South, is {{mentioned}} {{very near the}} beginning, but never appears. We gain {{the impression that he}} is a decent man, as Preston and his friends think {{he is going to be}} teaching him this year, and are <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|The leading New York {{papers have}} sent men over for to-morrow night with {{instructions}} to telegraph columns of descriptions. Great excitement and expectation everywhere. Fields {{says he has}} <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> so long that he knows he will die at five minutes to eight.|$|R
60|$|With {{extreme care}} they raised the old dog's body, whose faded tan and white showed {{here and there}} under the leaves stirred by the wind. They laid it, heavy, cold, and unresponsive, in the grave, and Jolly spread more leaves over it, while Jolyon, deeply afraid to show emotion before his son, began quickly shovelling the earth on to that still shape. There went the past! If only there were a joyful future to <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to!</b> <b>It</b> was like {{stamping}} down earth on one's own life. They replaced the turf carefully on the smooth little mound, and, grateful that they had spared each other's feelings, {{returned to the house}} arm-in-arm.|$|E
60|$|The pampered aristocrat, {{whose life}} is one {{continued}} round of licentious pleasures and sensual gratifications; or the gloomy enthusiast, who detests the cheerful amusements he can never enjoy, and envies the healthy feelings he can never know, {{and who would}} put down the one and suppress the other, until he made the minds of his fellow-beings as besotted and distorted as his own;--neither of these men can by possibility form an adequate notion of what Sunday really is to those whose lives are spent in sedentary or laborious occupations, and who are accustomed to <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> through their whole existence, as their only day of rest from toil, and innocent enjoyment.|$|E
60|$|Among {{the group}} of men and boys {{assembled}} round {{the mouth of the}} Vaughan pit on the 7th of June were two little lads, Jack Simpson and Harry Shepherd, who were to make the descent for the first time. The boys were fast friends. Harry was the taller but was slighter than Jack, and far less sturdy and strong. Both were glad that they were to go into the pit, for although the life of a gate-boy is dull and monotonous, yet in the pit villages the boys <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> as marking {{the first step in a}} man's life, as putting school and lessons behind, and as raising them to a position far in advance of their former associates.|$|E
60|$|We {{have another}} hunting-party at Vissarion next week. Teuta is <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> with {{extraordinary}} interest. She hopes then {{to present to}} our brothers of the Balkans our little son, and she is eager {{to know if they}} endorse her mother-approval of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{sounds like}} a remark made to open the way to conversation." [...] Jeff went on to burlesque a reply in the same spirit. [...] "Oh, very much so indeed, Miss Lynde! We are all <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> so eagerly. Are you coming?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{all works}} out splendidly. To-morrow's the Invitation Handicap, and father's been <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> for weeks. He'd hate {{to have to}} go up to town himself and not play in it. But you can slip up and slip back without his knowing {{anything}} about it." ...|$|R
