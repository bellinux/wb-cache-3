40|$|Ventricular arrhythmias {{following}} {{myocardial infarction}} may originate from subendocardial Purkinje fibres in the infarcted area. The role of potassium and sodium-calcium exchange currents on action potential duration was therefore investigated in Purkinje fibres surviving infarction and in normal Purkinje fibres. Barium {{was used to}} reduce potassium conductance and replacement of sodium chloride by lithium chloride was used to reduce the sodium-calcium exchange current. Barium (1 x 10 - 5 to 3 x 10 - 5 M) produced a concentration dependent <b>lenghthening</b> of action potential duration in normal Purkinje fibres but these concentrations had no effect in Purkinje fibres surviving infarction. The resting membrane potential, activation voltage, amplitude and V̇(max) were decreased in Purkinje fibres surviving infarction and in barium treated fibres v normal Purkinje fibres. These results show that action potential characteristics of barium treated normal Purkinje fibres closely resemble those seen in Purkinje fibres surviving infarction. A similar reduction of action potential duration was seen in normal Purkinje fibres, fibres surviving infarction and barium treated fibres when the sodium 'window' current was decreased by lignocaine. Without any effect on the V̇(max), the replacement of sodium chloride by lithium chloride resulted in a similar effect on the action potential duration in normal Purkinje fibres and fibres surviving infarction. The {{results show that the}} longer action potential duration found in Purkinje fibres surviving infarction can be explained by a decrease of the potassium conductance and not by an increase of the sodium 'window' current or the sodium-calcium exchange current. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Loss of {{function}} mutations of human DKC 1 gene cause Dyskeratosis Congenita X-linked (X-DC), a multisystemic syndrome accompanied by telomerase defects, premature aging, increased cancer susceptibility and stem cell dysfunction. The protein encoded by DKC 1, called dyskerin, is a pseudouridine synthase {{belonging to a}} highly evolutively conserved family. Dyskerin participates {{to the formation of}} the H/ACA snoRNP complexes involved in a variety of cellular functions, including pseudouridylation and processing of rRNAs, transcriptional control and telomere elongation. The striking evolutive conservation of snoRNP functions, coupled with a highly divergent mechanism of telomere <b>lenghthening,</b> makes Drosophila a suitable system in which to assess the mechanisms by which pseudouridine synthases regulate stemness maintenance. Since Drosophila midgut has recently emerged as an ideal model {{for the study of the}} molecular mechanisms underlying somatic stem cell maintenance, it provides an useful system to evaluate the effects caused by loss {{of function}} of genes involved in this process. I thus used the GAL 4 /UAS system to silence in vivo Nop 60 b/mfl, the Drosophila ortholog of DKC 1, and investigate in detail the effects triggered by gene silencing on the formation of larval Adult Midgut Precursor (AMPs) cells. I found that mfl silencing totally disrupts the formation of larval imaginal islands, the typical stem niches in which AMPs are organized. MFL-depleted AMPs are strongly reduced in their number and appear dispersed into the epithelium, but they still retain the expression of stemness markers as escargot (a member of the Snail/Slug superfamily of Zinc finger proteins), Delta and Arm...|$|E
40|$|Hypokinesia/hypodynamia was induced in the hindlimb {{muscles of}} the rat, using a {{suspension}} technique. This caused differing degrees of atrophy in different muscles. However, this atrophy was reduced in muscles held in a <b>lenghthened</b> position. The greatest degree of wasting was observed in the unstretched soleus, a slow postural muscle, where both Type 1 and Type 2 a fibers atrophied to the same degree. However, wasting of the gastrocnemius muscle {{was associated with a}} reduction {{in the size of the}} Type 2 b fibers. In both slow-postural and fast-phasic hindlimb muscles, atrophy was brought about by a reduction in the rate of protein synthesis in conjunction with an elevation in the rate of protein degradation. When inactive muscles were passively stretched, both protein synthesis and degradation were dramatically elevated. Even periods of stretch of as little as 0. 5 h/d were found to significantly decrease atrophy in inactive muscles...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedSingle-gene mutants with {{extended}} lifespan {{have been}} described in several species. We performed the first genome-wide screen for long-lived mutants in a prokaryotic organism, using the Gram negative bacterium Escherichia coli. The screen revealed strains lacking components of the electron transport chain and the TCA cycle that exhibit longer stationary phase survival and increased resistance to heat and oxidative stress compared to wild-type. Extended survival in the sdhA mutant, lacking subunit A of succinate dehydrogenase, is associated with reduced production of superoxide. On the other hand, the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor ArcA and the bypass of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex through the pyruvate oxidase / acetyl-CoA synthetase enzyme pair independently contribute to the <b>lenghthened</b> lifespan of the lipoic acid synthase mutant (lipA). Oxidative damage in the formof protein carbonylation does not limit the stationary phase survival of E. coli. Since analogous metabolic changes involving different carbon sources have been observed in long-lived Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans strains, our {{results indicate that the}} switch from respiratory to fermentative metabolism in the presence of oxygen might be an evolutionarily conserved strategy to enhance stress resistance and extend lifespan...|$|R
40|$|For {{surgical}} treatment of urinary stress incontinence in women today are available many different surgical procedures. It confirms {{that none of}} them can successfuly cure all patients and achieve continents with the absence of new symptoms or side effects. Vaginal needle suspensions were developed during four decades and {{played an important role in}} the treatment of stress urinary incontinence. Worse long-term results,comparing to other methods,and new surgical procedures with better cure rate,beats his primacy few year ago. Suspending sutures are important part of every vaginal suspending operation and tension forces applyed to tyed them were mostly described by authors. The aims of this study were measuring the tying forces of suspending sutures,bladder neck replacement and increase in urethral lenght. Measuring are accomplish during two surgical procedures. One of them mobilise bladder neck (Raz) during operation,and another (Stamey) does not. Measuring were done od the end of the operation,in 60 patients, 50 of them were operated by Raz modification and 10 by Stamey modification. Preoperative evaluation were perfomed through SEAPI incontinence classification system. Suspension sutures tying force measuring were made with specialy developed dynamometar constructed from Procron stainless steel. Later we calculated tying forces from dynamometar extesion. Bladder neck replacement and increase in urethral length were calculated from catether marks measuring after suspension sutures were tyed. Average suspending sutures tying forces at Raz operation was 20, 91 N (14, 84 - 29, 06) with average blader neck suspension of 18, 4 mm(14 - 23) and urethral lenghtening of 8, 7 mm(6 - 12). Stamey operation have average tying forces 33, 08 N (27, 81 - 39, 44),bladder neck suspension 8, 3 mm(6 - 12) and urethral <b>lenghthening</b> 3, 2 mm(2 - 4) In early postoperative period,after catheter removal,urinary retention and urgencies are estimated. During follow-up period continence status,bladder empting ability and urgencies are clinicaly evaluated. Follow-up period was 10 years and 5 patients were lost from the study. After 10 years 14 (29, 7 %) patients with Raz operation were completely dry in every occasion and 10 (20, 3 %) patients have mild stress incontinence with severe stress maneuvers,but not with normal activities and no pads required. 19 (40, 6 %) patients were incontinent as before surgery or worse and 4 (8, 5 %) patients were incontinent but better than before surgery. Results with Stamey operations were significantly worse. None of 10 patiens were continent afther 10 years,two were continent afther 5 years but had failed during sixth year. Significant correlation between tying forces,bladder neck suspension and increase in urethral lenght with the result of treatment was not established. Inspite of such results several indicators connecting higher tying forces and treatment failure. Average tying forces was slightly higher in patients with recurrent stress incontinence compared with continent patients and percentage of continent patients was convinsigly higher among group with tying forces below mean value. Positive correlation between tying forces and degree of postoperative urgencies and negative correlation between postoperative urgencies and successful treatment support connection of tretment failure and higher tying forces. Three preoperative aspects have significant correlation with postoperative results. Subjective stress-related leak assessment and protection use have negative correlation with successful tretment,while ALPP confirm positive correlation. Urinary retentions and urgencies in early postoperative period have significant positive connection with tying forces of suspending sutures. The poorer long-term results of needle bladder neck suspensions were consequence of fascial damageing with suspending sutures tension and his loosing with stress incontinence recurrence. Suspending sutures tying forces would not exeed 20 N because higher forces can result with tissue damageing...|$|E
