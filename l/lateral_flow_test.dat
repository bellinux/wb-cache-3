50|$|Current {{research}} in microfluidics {{is focused on}} developing point-of-care diagnostics and cell sorting techniques (see lab-on-a-chip), and understanding cell behavior (e.g. cell growth, cell aging). In the field of diagnostics, the <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> is a common microfluidic device platform that utilizes capillary forces to drive fluid transport through a porous membrane. The most famous <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> is the take home pregnancy test, in which bodily fluid initially wets and then flows through the porous membrane, often cellulose or glass fiber, upon reaching a capture line to indicate a positive or negative signal. An advantage to this design, and several other microfluidic devices, is its simplicity (for example, its lack of human intervention during operation) and low cost. However, a disadvantage to these tests is that capillary action cannot be controlled after it has started, so the test time cannot be sped up or slowed down (which could pose an issue if certain time-dependent processes are to take place during the fluid flow).|$|E
5000|$|The flow {{behaviour}} in traditional capillary follows the Washburn's equation. Recently, novel capillary pumps with a constant pumping flow rate {{independent of the}} liquid viscosity [...] were developed, which have a significant advantage over the traditional capillary pump (of which the {{flow behaviour}} is Washburn behaviour, namely the flow rate is not constant). These new concepts of capillary pump are of great potential to improve the performance of <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

This <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> uses microbeads coated with an anti-body specific to PLRV. Virus particles are separated from the plant tissue using a powerful magnet.

30|$|Up to date, <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>tests,</b> {{also called}} <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> immunochromatographic assays, {{have been widely}} used in {{qualitative}} and semiquantitative detection of biomarkers. This technology utilizes antigen-antibody reaction features to detect numbers of analytes, including antigens, antibodies, and even the products of nucleic acid amplification tests [1, 2]. They have merits of user-friendly format, rapid detection, long-term stability, and relatively low cost [3, 4]. However, most colloidal gold <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>tests</b> are analyzed by naked eyes, which is subjective and inaccurate. For these reasons, many groups have engaged in developing novel labeling materials to replace colloidal gold. Quantum dots (QDs), one kind of novel nanomaterial, are composed of periodic groups of II-IV, III-V, or IV-VI semiconductor material. Quantum dots have many advantages compared with colloidal gold, such as high fluorescent intensity, broad absorption spectra, narrow and symmetric emission bands, and excellent stability [5 – 12]. On the other hand, most <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>tests</b> could only implement qualitative detection. In order to realize quantitative detection, some groups [13 – 17] have dedicated to this issue. Huang et al. [2] utilized a photomultiplier tube (PMT) as a signal acquisition device for up-conversion of nanoparticle-labeled test strips. Although PMT has high sensitivity, it is with a limited surveyed area. Mei's group [1] chose a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor to capture test strip images. Besides, our group [18] employed a charge-coupled device (CCD) with an image acquisition card as an image sensor to capture test strip images. However, the image acquisition limited the application of this instrument and, at the same time, resulted in complexity and high cost. In this article, an improved test strip reader is presented.|$|R

However {{it is possible to}} measure the intensity of the test line to determine the quantity of analyte in the sample. Handheld diagnostic devices known as lateral flow readers are used by several companies to provide a fully quantitative assay result. By utilizing unique wavelengths of light for illumination in conjunction with either CMOS or CCD detection technology, a signal rich image can be produced of the actual test lines. Using image processing algorithms specifically designed for a particular test type and medium, line intensities can then be correlated with analyte concentrations. One such handheld lateral flow device platform is made by Detekt Biomedical L.L.C.. [...] Alternative non-optical techniques are also able to report quantitative assays results. One such example is a magnetic immunoassay (MIA) in the <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> form also allows for getting a quantified result.

40|$|Abstract Background Dengue is a {{major public}} health problem in {{tropical}} and subtropical countries. Rapid and easy diagnosis of dengue can assist patient triage and care-management. The detection of DENV NS 1 on rapid <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>tests</b> offers a fast route to a presumptive dengue diagnosis but careful evaluations are urgently needed {{as more and more}} people use them. Methods The sensitivity and specificity of the Bio-Rad NS 1 Ag Strip and SD Dengue Duo (NS 1 /IgM/IgG) <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> rapid <b>tests</b> were evaluated in a panel of plasma samples from 245 Vietnamese patients with RT-PCR confirmed dengue and 47 with other febrile illnesses. Results The NS 1 rapid tests had similar diagnostic sensitivities (respectively 61. 6 % and 62. 4 %) in confirmed dengue cases but were 100 % specific. When IgM/IgG results from the SD Dengue Duo were included in the test interpretation, the sensitivity improved significantly from 62. 4 % with NS 1 alone to 75. 5 % when NS 1 and/or IgM was positive and 83. 7 % when NS 1 and/or IgM and/or IgG was positive. Both NS 1 assays were significantly more sensitive for primary than secondary dengue. NS 1 positivity was associated with the underlying viraemia as NS 1 -positive samples had a significantly higher viraemia than NS 1 -negative samples. Conclusions These data suggest that the NS 1 test component of these assays are highly specific and have similar levels of sensitivity. The IgM parameter in the SD Duo test improved overall test sensitivity without compromising specificity.

30|$|In this study, {{we report}} {{a simple and}} {{sensitive}} QDs-based rapid detection method for syphilis antibody. Its test result was {{compared with that of}} colloidal gold–based rapid test strips. Regarding the colloidal gold–based rapid immunochromatographic test, the sensitivity of 82 % (95 % CI, 68 – 91 %) was obtained in 50 known syphilis-positive sera, which is accordant to the assertion that one-step immunochromatographic rapid test was not sufficiently sensitive [24]. In particular, {{it is often difficult to}} interpret in some weakly positive sera. Owing to its ease to perform, one-step <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> is still recommended for primary healthcare settings in developing countries. However, limited equipments for reserve and insufficient training in developing countries may cause the worrisomely low sensitivity. According to Zhi-qiang Chen et al., the total incidence of primary and secondary syphilis in China, 5.7 cases per 100, 000 in 2005, was reported, much higher than that in most developed countries [25]. If some of those patients seek care from ill-equipped private clinical setting, the consequence of misdiagnosis caused by the low sensitivity of colloidal gold–based <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> strips would be devastating. In contrast with traditional <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> strips, Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) was cried up for its excellent sensitivity. But its complicated and lengthy operation makes it not suitable for the first line screening or on-site screening of syphilis. In addition, as for colloidal gold–based rapid test strips, another problem is the interference of hemolytic serum. The coloring is difficult to distinguish in some cases when hemolysis occurs. In order to resolve these problems, fluorescence or other labels have been taken into consideration [11]. However, conventional fluorescent dyes suffer from some limits including narrow excitation spectrum, poor photostability and short fluorescent lifetime, all of which greatly restrict the application of those fluorescent dyes in <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> strips [26].|$|E

Methodology/Principle Findings: Pools of infection and control sera were screened against four different soluble form variant surface glycoproteins (sVSGs) by ELISA and one, sVSG 117, showed particularly strong immunoreactivity to pooled infection sera. Using individual sera, sVSG 117 was shown to be able to discriminate between T. b. gambiense infection and control sera by both ELISA and <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test.</b> The sVSG 117 antigen was subsequently used with a previously described recombinant diagnostic antigen, rISG 65, to create a dual-antigen <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> prototype.

Conclusion/Significance: In the virtual field trial, using two positive antigen bands as the criterion for infection, the sVSG 117 and rISG 65 dual-antigen <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> prototype showed a sensitivity of 97. 3 % (95 % CI: 93. 3 to 99. 2) and a specificity of 83. 3 % (95 % CI: 76. 4 to 88. 9) for the detection of T. b. gambiense infections.

The TvY 486 _ 0045500 and TvY 486 _ 0019690 ELISA tests gave identical sensitivity and specificity values for T. vivax infection of 94. 5 % (95 % CI, 86. 5 % to 98. 5 %) and 88. 0 % (95 % CI, 75. 7 % to 95. 5 %), respectively, and the TvY 486 _ 0045500 <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> prototype a sensitivity and specificity of 92. 0 % (95 % CI, 83. 4 % to 97. 0 %) and 89. 8 % (95 % CI, 77. 8 % to 96. 6 %), respectively. These data suggest that recombinant TvY 486 _ 0045500 shows promise {{for the development of a}} pen-side <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> for the diagnosis of T. vivax animal African trypanosomosis...|$|E
30|$|Despite the {{satisfying}} results, {{there is}} a need for further studies to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of the QDs-based <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> strip in patients with suspected infection and with positive serologic test results, and patients with other pathologic conditions. Besides, a multi-centric study in which the same samples are evaluated would be highly valuable. Moreover, it was very difficult to take clear fluorescent photos under ultraviolet lamp by the nonprofessional digital camera we used and therefore our group is working at a kind of mini-reader with ultraviolet source and a miniaturized professional charge-coupled device (CCD). We hope to take clear fluorescent photographs of QDs-based <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> strips for qualitative and quantitative analysis by this reader. With this equipment, we will be able to obtain a more accurate and objective result.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, we have {{developed}} a novel fluorescent POC rapid test method {{to be used for}} screening for syphilis that is inexpensive, easy to perform, and has been demonstrated to be suitable for on-the-site syphilis screening. Its clinical performance in clinical tests could make it a promising replacement for colloidal gold–based <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> strips.|$|E
40|$|Abstract GMO {{protein content}} in maize flours or fresh crops {{can be easily}} {{assessed}} by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunochromatographic (<b>lateral</b> <b>flow)</b> strip <b>tests</b> commercially available. Therefore, ELISA {{can be seen as}} a useful tool for screening, for control purposes and for traceability implementation. In order to highlight the importance of monitoring GMO protein presence in food products and to investigate the performance of representative ELISA commercial kits, we evaluated three commercial kits by measuring the amount of Cry 1 Ab/Cry 1 Ac in IRMM certified reference materials...|$|R
40|$|Although {{simple and}} {{low-cost}} interventions for {{sickle cell disease}} (SCD) exist in many developing countries, child mortality associated with SCD remains high, in part, {{because of the lack}} of access to diagnostic tests for SCD. A density-based test using aqueous multiphase systems (SCD-AMPS) is a candidate for a low-cost, point-of-care diagnostic for SCD. In this paper, the field evaluation of SCD-AMPS in a large (n =  505) case-control study in Zambia is described. Of the two variations of the SCD-AMPS used, the best system (SCD-AMPS- 2) demonstrated a sensitivity of 86 % (82 - 90 %) and a specificity of 60 % (53 - 67 %). Subsequent analysis identified potential sources of false positives that include clotting, variation between batches of SCD-AMPS, and shipping conditions. Importantly, SCD-AMPS- 2 was 84 % (62 - 94 %) sensitive in detecting SCD in children between 6 months and 1 year old. In addition to an evaluation of performance, an assessment of end-user operability was done with health workers in rural clinics in Zambia. These health workers rated the SCD-AMPS tests to be as simple to use as <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>tests</b> for malaria and HIV...|$|R
40|$|Background: Screening {{tests for}} gambiense {{sleeping}} sickness, {{such as the}} CATT/T. b. gambiense and a recently developed <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> <b>tests,</b> are hitherto based on native variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs), namely LiTat 1. 3 and LiTat 1. 5, purified from highly virulent trypanosome strains grown in rodents. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have expressed SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) fusion proteins of the immunogenic N-terminal part of these antigens in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The secreted recombinant proteins were affinity purified with yields up to 10 mg per liter cell culture. Conclusions/Significance: The diagnostic potential of each separate antigen and a mixture of both antigens was confirmed in ELISA on sera from 88 HAT patients and 74 endemic non-HAT controls. Replacement of native antigens in the screening tests for sleeping sickness by recombinant proteins will eliminate both the infection risk for the laboratory staff during antigen production {{and the need for}} laboratory animals. Upscaling production of recombinant antigens, e. g. in biofermentors, is straightforward thus leading to improved standardisation of antigen production and reduced production costs, which on their turn will increase the availability and affordability of the diagnostic tests needed for the elimination of gambiense HAT...|$|R
