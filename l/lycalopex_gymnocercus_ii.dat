40|$|Abstract Here {{we report}} the {{occurrence}} of Ancylostoma (Ancylostoma) buckleyi (Le Roux and Biocca, 1957) (Nematoda: Ancylostomatidae) in the small intestine of Pampas foxes (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>gymnocercus)</b> (Mammalia: Canidae). This fox is the most abundant native carnivore in southern South America, where it inhabits grasslands, open woodlands and areas highly modified by extensive ranching and agricultural activities. Material from 80 foxes in rural areas of southern Buenos Aires province, Argentina was examined. The intestinal tracts were carefully removed from each carcass and subsequently isolated by ligatures (pylorus and rectum). Examination of the intestinal content was performed using the sedimentation and counting technique. Four foxes (5 %) {{were found to be}} parasitized with adult specimens of A. buckleyi. This is the first report of Ancylostoma (A.) buckleyi in Argentina and adds L. gymnocercus as new host of this nematode species...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} the studies carried out on ceramic and bone {{materials}} recorded at Cerro Tapera Vázquez site (Argentinean Northeast) are presented. Taxonomic, anatomic and taphonomic studies of bone assemblages and technological-decorative analysis and refitting of pottery were undertaken. The site is located on a mound next to El Ceibo Creek, where 16 m 2 were excavated in 2008. Abundant smooth, incised and modeled pottery (handles and zoomorphic appendages) and numerous bones remains of Myocastor coypus (most frequent taxon), Blastocerus dichotomus, Ozotoceros bezoarticus, Cavia aperea, Leopardus geoffroyi, <b>Lycalopex</b> <b>gymnocercus,</b> Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris, birds and fish (Siluriformes and Characiformes) were recorded. Except Cavia aperea rodent and Dusicyon gimnocercus fox, all taxa show evidence of anthropic modification (cut marks, fresh fractures and burning). Two radiocarbon dates were obtained: 650 and 520 yrs. BP. The results reached in this study lead {{to the conclusion that the}} pre-Hispanic populations that occupied Cerro Tapera Vázquez by the end of the Late Holocene were riverine canoe peoples, with complex ceramic technology and subsistence based on hunting of coypu, capybara and cervids, fishing and small-scale horticulture...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{problems}} threatening wild fauna, {{being run over}} is an important one, which results in a high mortality rate for several species. This study aimed to identify the species run over along 98 km of BR 158 (which connects the county of Cruz Alta to the Val de Serra District in Júlio de Castilhos county, in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil), to analyze the monthly rates of roadkill, and to correlate this with the monthly total rainfall. Monthly expeditions were performed between April and September 2007, {{and a total of}} 61 animals belonging to fifteen species were recorded (a rate of 0. 10 ind. /km/month). The most victimized species were the skunk (Conepatus chinga), totaling 17 individuals (28 %), followed by the pampas fox (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>gymnocercus),</b> with seven individuals (11 %) and the crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), with five individuals (8 %). There was no difference in rates of roadkill among the sampling period; however, the month with the highest record of was September (n = 18). No correlation was verified for the rate of roadkill and monthly precipitation, but there was a trend between the occurrence of roadkill and a higher volume of rainfall...|$|R
40|$|Between January 2007 and December 2010, the {{abundance}} of medium-sized mammals was studied, with special focus on the Molina's hog-nosed skunk, Conepatus chinga (Molina, 1782), at four locations in southern Brazil. In this study, transect line methodology was used to obtain data for Distance Analyses. Transects were traveled by car at night, searching with spotlights {{along the edges of}} secondary roads in agricultural landscapes. Along 1, 811 km, we obtained 620 observations of 20 mammal species. The most common species was the exotic European hare, Lepus europaeus (Pallas, 1778); the highest abundance estimated for South America was observed in one of the study areas, where its density was estimated as 32 individuals/km². Carnivores were the most commonly recorded mammals, represented by 10 species and comprising 51 % of all observations. Molina's hog-nosed skunk occurred in all study areas, but occurred in sufficient numbers to obtain density estimates in only two of the areas. We estimated 1. 4 to 3. 8 individuals/km², in the first density estimate made by the transect method for a member of Conepatus in the Neotropics. These values are similar to those estimated for North American species of Mephitidae. In Brazil, C. chinga is apparently more abundant in the Pampa biome than in the grasslands of the Atlantic Forest. For two other carnivores, <b>Lycalopex</b> <b>gymnocercus</b> (Fisher, 1814) and Cerdocyon thous (Linnaeus, 1766), we estimated preliminary densities that were similar to those previously cited for different regions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCanine rangeliosis, {{caused by}} the piroplasmid protozoon Rangelia vitalii, is {{currently}} recognized as a reemerging disease that affects domestic dogs in Brazil. In the present study, piroplasmid infection was searched in wild canids (20 Cerdocyon thous and 4 <b>Lycalopex</b> <b>gymnocercus)</b> in Brazil. Molecular analysis, based on PCR and DNA sequencing of {{a portion of the}} 18 S rRNA gene, revealed that 30 % (6 / 20) C. thous were infected by R. vitalii. Blood and bone marrow samples from one of the R. vitalii-infected C. thous were inoculated into a domestic dog, which developed clinical rangeliosis that was confirmed by molecular tests. However, the C. thous donor showed no clinical, hematological or biochemical alterations, even though its R. vitalii infection status was confirmed for at least 80 days. These observations suggest that R. vitalii is not as highly pathogenic for C. thous as it is for domestic dogs. Phylogenetic analysis inferred by the 18 S rRNA gene placed R. vitalii embedded in the clade ‘Babesia sensu stricto’, consisting of a number of species that represent truly the genus Babesia. It is proposed that the species R. vitalii should be transferred to the genus Babesia. The present study expands our knowledge on the natural history of R. vitalii, suggesting that it might have a natural cycle involving the wild canid C. thous. Further studies are needed to confirm that C. thous is a natural reservoir of R. vitalii in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|The {{spread of}} enteric viruses of {{domestic}} animals {{and human beings}} to wild species can be facilitated by the resistance of these viruses {{on the environment and}} their ability to be transmitted by water and contaminated food. The health status of the populations of pampas foxes (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>gymnocercus)</b> and crab-eating foxes (Cerdocyon thous) is largely unknown and the landscapes occupied by these animals in southern Brazil have been threatened by human occupation and expansion of agriculture. In this work, the search of genomes of human and canine adenoviruses in feces from these wild carnivores was used to track the dissemination of domestic animals and human pathogens to the free-living populations in a wildlife reserve located in southern Brazil. This was performed by virus-specific differential real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) on stool specimens, avoiding capture and additional stress to the animals. Genus-specific conventional reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was complementarily performed aiming the detection of enteroviruses (EV) and rotaviruses (RV) on these same samples. HAdV genomes were found on 14 out of the 17 (82. 35 %) stool samples analysed, whereas CAV was found co-infecting 5 of these samples. RV genomes were detected on 7 of the 17 samples (41. 18 %) and all samples were negative for EV. The results point to the dispersion of HAdV and RV at a high rate to these species of South American wild carnivores, which can be an effect of growing anthropisation of the habitat of these animals. </p...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale, multispecies {{monitoring}} {{programs are}} used widely to assess changes in wildlife populations; however, they often assume constant detectability when documenting species occurrence. This assumption is rarely accurate because animal populations vary considerably {{across time and}} space. Furthermore, detectability of a species can be influenced {{by a number of}} physical, biological, or anthropogenic factors (e. g., weather, seasonality, topography, sampling methods, urban development). Analyses of habitat factors affecting occupancy and detection of mammalian species have not been conducted in the Paraguayan Chaco. To address this gap in the literature and provide conservation recommendations, I estimated site occupancy rates using species-specific detection probabilities for focal mammalian species at 3 study sites in the Chaco ecoregion of Paraguay. During remote camera surveys conducted August - November 2011 - 2012, I used photographic data and model selection techniques to assess the influence of different survey and site covariates on occupancy of several focal mammalian species: maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), Geoffroy 2 ̆ 7 s cat (Leopardus geoffroyi), puma (Puma concolor), crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), pampas fox (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>gymnocercus),</b> collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), and giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla). I recorded 2, 034 photographs of 24 mammalian species at 64 camera sites; among those, 1, 353 photographs and 529 independent survey-detections were of these 9 focal species. Detection of maned wolves and peccaries was higher in 2011 than 2012; other species did not show significant differences in detection by year. Peccaries were detected more frequently during higher temperatures, but foxes were detected more frequently during lower temperatures. The crab-eating fox was the species occupying the most sites (68...|$|R
40|$|In South America, the {{crab-eating fox}} Cerdocyon thous occurs in sympatry to the ecologically similar, and phylogenetically close Lycalopex vetulus to the North, and <b>Lycalopex</b> <b>gymnocercus</b> to the South of its range. We studied {{character}} displacement in Cerdocyon under {{the effect of}} Bergmann's rule and the presence (or absence either) of Lycalopex within the crab-eating fox range. We performed skull shape analysis on 191 C. thous specimens and divided them in three distinct groups, depending on whether Cerdocyon occurs in sympatry or in allopatry to Lycalopex species. We tested for differences in size and shape between Cerdocyon groups and regressed both skull size and sexual size dimorphism against latitude and temperature, while controlling for spatial autocorrelation in the phenotypes. Southern Cerdocyon specimens present enlarged temporalis muscle and slender carnassial, both suggestive of a shift towards increased carnivory. Such a niche shift is interpreted {{as a mean to}} reduce competition to the larger Lycalopex species, which is still smaller than Cerdocyon. Consistently with the above, the degree of sexual shape and size dimorphism in Cerdocyon increases southward. We found a complex but coherent pattern of size and shape differentiation in Cerdocyon groups, which is consistent with the effects of both competition and Bergmann's rule. Cerdocyon reduces competition to Lycalopex by growing larger in the North. To the South, Cerdocyon is still larger, in keeping with Bergmann's rule, but strongly differs in skull shape from both its Lycalopex competitor and from any other Cerdocyon. Since the Southern Lycalopex species is much more similar in size to Cerdocyon than its Northern congeneric, this suggests that shape differences serve the goal of reducing competition between Cerdocyon and Lycalopex to the South, as size differences do to the North. The absence of the hypercarnivorous canid Speothos venaticus from the southern range of Cerdocyon may have allowed such a pattern to take place...|$|R
40|$|In Argentina, hydatid disease {{caused by}} Echinococcus granulosus is widespread. The south of Buenos Aires province, Argentina, {{is one of}} the three regions where {{hydatidosis}} is endemic. Although domestic dogs and sheep are considered to be the main hosts for E. granulosus, the potential role of wildlife in the local transmission of E. granulosus has not been investigated. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the hydatidosis/echinococcosis prevalence in European hare (Lepus europaeus) and Pampas fox (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>gymnocercus),</b> two abundant species with a strong predator–prey relationship in rural areas of Buenos Aires province using different diagnostic tests. A total of 61 fox intestines were examined, finding that 52 (85. 2 %) harbored at least one helminth species. However, no adult or immature form of Echinococcus sp. was found in the intestinal contents. Coproparasitological analysis and Copro–ELISA followed by Copro–PCR were used as supplementary diagnostic tests. Only one (1. 7 %) of 59 fecal samples was positive to Taeniidae eggs by coproparasitological analysis, but this same sample was negative by the Copro–ELISA test. The analysis by Copro–ELISA showed 6 of 57 (10. 6 %) positive samples, but the Copro–PCR tests carried out on these samples were negative to E. granulosus. A total of 6, 808 lungs, 3, 576 livers, and 3, 542 hearts of hunted hares were examined and palpated, but no structure resembling hydatid cysts were detected. Our results suggest that hares and Pampas foxes are not currently important wild reservoirs of E. granulosus in the studied area. Fil: Scioscia, Nathalia Paula. Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata.
