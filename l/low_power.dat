5|$|In {{testing the}} {{transmitter}} proved only barely suitable in the air-to-air role, with short detection ranges {{due to its}} relatively <b>low</b> <b>power.</b> But to everyone's surprise, {{it was able to}} easily pick out the wharves and cranes at the Harwich docks a few miles south of Bawdsey. Shipping appeared as well, but the team was unable to test this very well as the Heyford was forbidden to fly over water. After this success, Bowen was granted two Avro Anson patrol aircraft, K6260 and K8758, along with five pilots stationed at Martlesham to test this ship-detection role. Early tests demonstrated a problem with noise from the ignition system interfering with the receiver, but this was soon resolved by fitters at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE).|$|E
5|$|It was {{confirmed}} on June 8, 2015, at Apple's WWDC that the iPad 2 would support iOS 9. This makes the iPad 2 the first iPad and only iOS device to support six major versions of iOS. As with previous releases, though, many headline features are unavailable on the iPad 2, including predictive Siri, translucency effects, split-view, slide-over and picture-in-picture multitasking, <b>Low</b> <b>Power</b> Mode and the Health app. iOS 9 {{is said to}} feature performance improvements that may help the aging device function more smoothly, and initial tests suggest {{that it did not}} significantly impact available space. Other A5-based devices will also support iOS 9 including the iPhone 4S (five major iOS versions), the iPad Mini (four major iOS versions) and iPod Touch 5G (four major iOS versions).|$|E
5|$|The {{major part}} of the {{subsequent}} attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's <b>low</b> <b>power</b> coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.|$|E

In the heavy manufacturing industries, sometimes, heavy tools are employed for different types of work. But the application of robots with heavy tools is not possible due to the limited torque limits of actuators. Suspended tool systems (STS) have been proposed to manipulate heavy tools by <b>low</b> <b>powered</b> robot-arm for this purpose. A <b>low</b> <b>powered</b> five-bar direct-drive parallel manipulator is designed and constructed to manipulate heavy tools suspended from a spring balancer. The validity, usefulness, and effectiveness of the suspended tool system are shown by experimental results. <br /...|$|R
