5|$|The {{possibility}} of reopening the Bergen Street lower level was <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>as</b> {{part of the}} study for the reintroduction of F express service as it could reduce the impact of less local service at the busy station. The station, if reopened, would require significant and expensive reconstruction, including making the station ADA accessible, the reconstruction of platform stairs, improved lighting and communications, waterproofing and concrete repairs, among other things. The rehabilitation would cost $75 million, and therefore the lower level is not currently planned to be reopened.|$|E

25|$|A {{reference}} {{model in}} general {{is a model of}} something that embodies the basic goal or idea of something and can then be <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>as</b> a reference for various purposes. A business reference model is a means to describe the business operations of an organization, independent of the organizational structure that perform them. Other types of business reference model can also depict the relationship between the business processes, business functions, and the business area’s business reference model. These reference model can be constructed in layers, and offer a foundation for the analysis of service components, technology, data, and performance.|$|E
25|$|Recently, tumor {{growth has}} been studied using {{mathematics}} and continuum mechanics. Vascular tumors (formed from blood vessels) are thus <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>as</b> being amalgams of a solid skeleton formed by sticky cells and an organic liquid filling the spaces in which cells can grow. Under this type of model, mechanical stresses and strains {{can be dealt with}} and their influence on the growth of the tumor and the surrounding tissue and vasculature elucidated. Recent findings from experiments that use this model show that active growth of the tumor is restricted to the outer edges of the tumor, and that stiffening of the underlying normal tissue inhibits tumor growth as well.|$|E

Some of the wounds that were allowed to be performed on were external injuries, such as skin lesions caused by a sharp edge, such as by a sword, dagger and axe or through household tools such as knives.

McCoy noted that banks could receive CRA credit by lending or brokering loans in lower-income areas that would be considered a risk for ordinary lending practices. CRA regulated banks may also inadvertently facilitate these lending practices by financing lenders. They noted that CRA regulations, as then administered and carried out by Fannie Mae and Freddie MAC, did not penalize banks that engaged in these lending practices. They recommended that the federal agencies use the CRA to sanction behavior that either directly or indirectly increased predatory lending practices by lowering the CRA rating of any bank that facilitated in these lending practices.|$|E

His paintings were featured prominently in his most critically acclaimed film, 1997's Hana-bi. Although for years already Kitano's largest audience had been the foreign arthouse crowd, Hana-bi cemented his status internationally as one of Japan's foremost modern filmmakers. Although it was not a big success financially, it won the Golden Lion award at the 1997 Venice Film Festival.

25|$|Lenders {{argue that}} the real estate attorney's fee, for example, is a {{pass-through}} cost, not a cost of the lending. In effect, they are arguing that the attorney's fee is a separate transaction and {{not a part of}} the loan. Consumer advocates argue that this would be true if the customer is free to select which attorney is used. If the lender insists, however, on using a specific attorney, the cost should be <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>as</b> a component of the total cost of doing business with that lender. This area is made more complicated by the practice of contingency fees – for example, when the lender receives money from the attorney and other agents to be the one used by the lender. Because of this, U.S. regulators require all lenders to produce an affiliated business disclosure form which shows the amounts paid between the lender and the appraisal firms, attorneys, etc.|$|E
25|$|Evenness is the {{difference}} between the percentage of a minority in a particular part of a city, compared to the city as a whole. Exposure is the likelihood that a minority and a majority party will come in contact with one another. This dimension shows the exposure to other diversity groups while sharing the same neighborhoods. Clustering is the gathering of different minority groups into one certain space; clustering often leads to one big ghetto and the formation of hyperghettoization. Centralization is the number of people within a minority group that is located {{in the middle of an}} urban area, often <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>as</b> a percentage of a minority group living in the middle of a city compared with the rest of their group living elsewhere. Concentration is the dimension that relates to the actual amount of land a minority lives on within its particular city. The higher segregation is within that particular area, the smaller the amount of land a minority group will control.|$|E
25|$|LeuT {{has been}} co-crystallised with {{sertraline}} and (R)- and (S)-fluoxetine where the SSRIs {{have been found}} to bind as non-competitive inhibitors in a vestibule binding site (can be <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>as</b> a second binding site), which is separated from the drugs binding site by the site chains of the two aromatic amino acids of the extracellular gate of the transport protein. The halogens on the SSRIs chemical structure all bind to the same HBP within LeuT and interact with similar amino acids, but the amino acid sequence in the HBP is highly preserved between LeuT and SERT. That suggest that in the human SERT the SSRIs also bind both at the same position and with similar manner, which is a key feature making the SSRIs selective for SERT. Conversely, there could be differences in their binding where {{the other part of the}} drug molecule will likely bind to SERT in a different way, given the diversity in their structure. The localisation of the vestibular binding site, as the primary SSRI binding site in SERT is, is however controversial since some research has shown that the SSRIs work in competitive manner by binding to the drugs binding site, not to the second binding site.|$|E
