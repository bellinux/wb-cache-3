50|$|Petty Officer LORANGE {{is cited}} for {{extraordinary}} heroism {{on the afternoon}} of 19 March 1979 when he rescued a young boy from drowning in the turbulent surf at Agingan Point, Saipan, Northern Marianas Islands. The boy and a friend were fishing off the point when he was swept out to sea by the high surf. His young companion tossed a <b>log</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the boy and ran for help. When advised of the accident, Petty Officer LORANGE and three shipmates from U.S. Coast Guard Loran Monitor Station Saipan immediately proceeded to the scene. Upon arrival, the boy was observed approximately 70-yards offshore, holding on to the log in an area locally known as “Shark Alley.” With complete disregard for his own safety, Petty Officer LORANGE dove off the 10 to 12-foot cliff and swam through the 15-foot breaking surf and 10-foot swells to the helpless boy. Reaching the bleeding victim, Petty Officer LORANGE quickly calmed him down and towed him {{to the base of the}} cliff. The other Coast Guardsmen then tossed him a life ring with a line attached. While being pulled to safety, Petty Officer LORANGE maintained his hold on the boy while using his feet to fend off the side of the cliff. With the boy safely ashore, Petty Officer LORANGE, a trained EMT, assisted in treating the boy for shock and lacerations while en route to the hospital. Petty Officer LORANGE demonstrated remarkable initiative, exceptional fortitude, and daring in spite of imminent personal danger in this rescue. His unselfish actions, courage and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.|$|E
40|$|Help {{children}} learn vocabulary by reading Vocabulary {{is fundamental to}} reading. As elementary students cross over from learning to read into reading to learn, vocabulary knowledge becomes increasingly important. The massive amount of vocabulary a student must learn precludes large amounts of time spent on any single word (Carver 1994, Schwanenflugel et al. 1997), except perhaps for some words that the student will read and write {{many times over the}} course of a lifetime. Therefore students must learn vocabulary from text. 1 Help {{children learn}} vocabulary during computer assisted oral reading Project LISTEN’s Reading Tutor listens to children read aloud, and helps them learn to read (Mostow & Aist CALICO 1999). The Reading Tutor shows the child a story one sentence at a time, listens to the child read all or part of the sentence out loud, and responds with help in recorded human voices. When the Reading Tutor has heard the student read every content word, the Reading Tutor shows the next sentence. Besides reading, the student may click Go to see the next sentence, Back to move back, on a word or on Help to hear the word read by the Tutor or get other help, or Goodbye to <b>log</b> <b>out.</b> <b>To</b> learn new words from interacting with the Reading Tutor, a student must: • spend time reading, • read new material hard enough to have new words, and • learn the meaning of new words when encountered. We excluded the first factor [...] time on task [...] as outside the scope of this thesis. We addressed the second factor by modifying the Reading Tutor to take turns picking stories with students, to expose students to more new material than they would have read if they picked all the stories themselves. We addressed the third factor by designing, implementing, and evaluating ways to augment stories with extra help [...] such as synonyms or glossary definitions [...] to make the most of encounters with novel words...|$|E

50|$|The Indian River {{starts at}} Brook Trout Lake in the West Canada Lakes {{region of the}} {{southwest}} Adirondack Mountains. Traveling downstream, it picks up the Cobblestone Creek coming in on its left, just before it forms the Green Stillwater, a 1/2 mile long flatwater section {{at the base of}} Indian Mountain. Then the river forms a series of rapids for a half mile or so before it slows and forms what is locally called the Big Eddy, a deep pool where the river makes a hard left. After this, the outlet of Mountain Lake joins the Indian River from the left, only 50' below what once was the first crossing of the river, a log bridge that loggers constructed back in the 1960s, in order <b>to</b> bring their <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> market from the deep woods. The bridge was destroyed by authorities in the 1970s, about when the Indian was declared a wild river by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.|$|R

Gary, driven by thirty years of diverted plans, and Irene, haunted by a tragedy in her past, are trying to rebuild their life together. Following the outline of Gary's old dream, they're hauling <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Caribou Island in good weather and in terrible storms, in sickness and in health, to patch together the kind of cabin that drew them to Alaska in the first place.

From the author of the massively-acclaimed Legend of a Suicide, comes a devastating novel about a marriage, a couple blighted by past shadows and the weight of expectation, of themselves and of each other.

50|$|Burrs Mill Brook {{was used}} as a logging mill in the early 1900s. There are still trails in Tabernacle that were used as roads <b>to</b> carry the <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> other towns. Once the Mill was shut down, people started using the Trails as roads. In the 1970s a lot of Tabernacle, NJ's roads were paved and people started to just use paved roads. Over time people stopped using the Trails because they could use the more easy paved roads. The roads went into decline and began overgrown. In the 80s, kids used the Trails as walking trails. Back then, there were many Trails and because there were no quads or dirt bikes the trails were so nice, you could drive a car on them still after 29 years since the last time they were a road. Once kids moved out of the neighborhood, the trail went into decline, more and more Trails were {{becoming}} overgrown, and the area became more dense. Then in the 2000s kids moved into the neighborhood and by now quads and dirt bikes were out and kids began using them as quaffing areas.

5000|$|The future {{mayor of}} Santa Cruz, Fred Swanton, {{decided that the}} land {{could be used to}} {{generate}} renewable energy. In {{the last decade of the}} 1800s he built a powerhouse with two dams on Big Creek and Mill Creek, and generated hydro-electric power for the Central Coast Counties Gas and Electric which became part of PG&E. However, after a forest fire broke out the flume was destroyed and the powerhouse was abandoned. To assist with logging on the land the Ocean Shore Railroad was constructed. It ran along the coast from San Francisco to Santa Cruz. The railroad hauled <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> of Swanton <b>to</b> the San Vincente Lumber Company sawmill in Santa Cruz.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the mass of the central supermassive black hole, M_bh, and the host galaxy luminosity, L_gal, in a sample of quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR 7). We use composite quasar spectra binned by black hole mass and redshift to assess galaxy features that would otherwise be overwhelmed by noise in individual spectra. The black hole mass is calculated using the photoionization method, and the host galaxy luminosity is inferred from the depth of the Ca II H + K features in the composite spectra. We evaluate the evolution in the M_bh - L_gal relationship by examining the redshift dependence of Delta log M_bh, the offset in black hole mass from the local black hole - bulge relationship. There is little systematic trend in Delta <b>log</b> M_bh <b>out</b> <b>to</b> z = 0. 8. Using the width of the [O III] emission line as a proxy for the stellar velocity dispersion, sigma_*, we find agreement of our derived host luminosities with the locally-observed Faber-Jackson relation. This supports the utility of the width of the [O III] line as a proxy for sigma_* in statistical studies. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures; final version; major revision...|$|R
