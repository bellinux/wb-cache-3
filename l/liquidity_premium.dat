5000|$|In economics, a <b>liquidity</b> <b>premium</b> is the {{explanation}} for a difference between two types of financial securities (e.g. stocks), that have all the same qualities except liquidity. It is a segment of a three-part theory that works to explain the behavior of yield curves for interest rates. The upwards-curving component of the interest yield {{can be explained by}} the <b>liquidity</b> <b>premium.</b> The reason behind this is that short term securities are less risky compared to long term rates due to the difference in maturity dates. Therefore investors expect a premium, or risk premium for investing in the risky security. Liquidity risk premiums are recommended to be used with longer term investments, where those particular investments are illiquid.|$|E

5000|$|Property premium {{is the key}} {{concept in}} the system of property-based {{economics}} developed by Gunnar Heinsohn, Otto Steiger, and Hans-Joachim Stadermann. It is an insight derived from the legal distinction between property and possession which is made by jurists, but not by economists. The distinction between property and possession is used by Heinsohn and Steiger to classify forms of society. [...] "Three distinctive systems of material reproduction are known to man: (i) custom or tribal societies, (ii) command or feudal societies and (iii) ownership- or property-based societies." [...] The first two are based on possession, which is a physical, material concept. Property, on the other hand, is an abstract, intangible concept, and thus can only exist as a creation of law and within the realm established by the rule of law. Where such a regime of law is established, property arises; and it is accompanied by the phenomenon of property premium. [...] "As soon as property is created it carries an unearned and immaterial premium, the property premium. This premium exists {{in addition to the}} physical use of goods or resources in their possessional state and consists of two powers: (i) its capacity of backing the issue of money which can be created only in a credit contract and (ii) its eligibility to serve as collateral for obtaining credit." [...] It is this property premium which explains the phenomenon of interest. The owner gives up his property premium by using his property to back the issue of that money; what he gains in exchange is interest. The borrower likewise forgoes property premium in engaging a loan, because he must back his promise of repayment with collateral, pledging his property as security for repayment of the loan. What he receives in return is <b>liquidity</b> <b>premium,</b> which is the capacity to cancel indebtedness. [...] "Keynes's idea that interest is the payment for forgoing <b>liquidity</b> <b>premium,</b> therefore, falls short. The debtor's payment of interest materializes the creditor's property premium, while the debtor's property premium gives rise to liquidity premium." ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{looks at}} the {{determinants}} of <b>liquidity</b> <b>premium</b> of the term structure of interest rates. Based upon a very simple model, we show that <b>liquidity</b> <b>premium</b> is not necessarily positive, as usually believed. This point is illustrated empirically with Chilean data for the sample period 1983 - 1999. Our estimation results show that <b>liquidity</b> <b>premium</b> is not only time-varying but that it also depends on the curvature of the term structure, expected inflation, expected depreciation of the nominal exchange rate, and on economic activity, contradicting the expectations hypothesis. For our sample period, the <b>liquidity</b> <b>premium</b> is usually negative, and when positive it is very small. This implies that investors are willing to hold long-term assets even though their return is relatively lower. This {{appears to be a}} consequence of indexation, which reduces the risk of long-term bonds as their return is linked to past inflation. Alternatively, we believe that a negative <b>liquidity</b> <b>premium</b> may be explained by the preferred habitat hypothesis of interest rates. Indeed, data on the composition of the portfolios of Chilean insurance and re-insurance companies show that, due to immunization (matching of durations of assets and liabilities), about a 60 percent of total assets correspond with long-term bonds and mortgage securities. This investment strategy drives the prices of long-term financial instruments up, and their rates down. ...|$|E
