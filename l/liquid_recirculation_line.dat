40|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> is {{a method}} of {{improving}} evaporator performance by supplying the evaporator with more liquid than is evaporated. The excess liquid, which is generally provided {{by means of an}} externally driven, mechanical pump, eliminates dryout and increases overall heat transfer coefficient in the evaporator. <b>Liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> is common in large-scale industrial refrigeration systems, where the additional cost and complexity of the pump is justified by the large size of the system. However, <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> has yet to gain widespread application in small-scale systems, such as residential or automotive air conditioning. The use of an ejector to provide the recirculation effect rather than a mechanical pump can help <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> systems gain consideration for small-scale systems. However, the performance of <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> cycles with and without ejectors for small-scale systems has yet to be thoroughly investigated. This paper presents the results of an experimental and numerical study of the effect of <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> on the performance of air condition cycles. The refrigerant R 410 A, commonly considered for residential systems, is used as the working fluid. A numerical model of a <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> cycle, capable of accounting for heat transfer and pressure drop effects in the evaporator, was developed and used to predict the effect that recirculation ratio (ratio of total evaporator mass flow rate to mass flow rate of vaporized liquid) has on cycle COP.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} simultaneous {{removal of}} ethylene, sparingly soluble in water, and ammonia gases by biofiltration as influenced by <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> flow and media types. Perlite and glass beads were utilized as media in eight and two biofilters, respectively. Continuous <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> flow rates ranged from 2. 7 - 5. 4, 5. 4 - 13, or 13 - 26 L/h. Two perlite biofilters were operated with the liquid recirculated at 13 L/h intermittently for 10 min/hr. The empty bed residence time was 30 s in each reactor. Gas flow rate was 7 L/min for each bioreactor, {{and the full}} media depth was 50 cm. ^ The experimental results showed that ethylene removal efficiencies increased with microbial adaptation and growth as time elapsed, but the characteristics of ethylene removal over time was varied with reactor types. One of the two perlite biotrickling filters with low <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> flow increased ethylene removal to 90 % due to low mass transfer limitations. However, other filters with medium, high, or intermittent <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> flow or with glass beads media reached only about 30 - 70 % probably due to relatively high mass transfer limitation, poor distribution of nutrition supplies, and low specific surface areas of media, respectively. On the other hand, ammonia was almost completely removed by each reactor. No significant effect of ammonia loading rates or removal efficiency on ethylene removal efficiencies was observed. Mathematical simulation was utilized to predict ethylene degradation and understand the relevant biofiltration mechanisms. The logistic model was used to fit the S-shape increase of ethylene removal efficiencies over time, and the numerical model was to analyze physic-chemical and biological mechanisms related to ethylene removal in each reactor. ...|$|R
40|$|The use of twin-screw pumps {{for moving}} fluids {{is not new}} {{technology}} but its application to wet gas compression (high gas volume fraction [GVF]) is still considered relatively new. There are many advantages for using twin-screw pumps for oil field applications; three of the immediate improvements include reducing hardware costs, reducing well bore pressure, and producing a pressure boost to move the product to a central collection facility. While there are many advantages to using twin-screw pumps in wet gas applications, there are some problems that have been encountered while operating at high GVFs. When operating at high GVF, over 95 percent twin-screw pumps experience a severe loss of efficiency and an increase of operating temperature. A common way {{to increase the efficiency}} while operating in the high GVF range includes adding a <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> system where a portion of liquid is stored downstream of the pump and is injected into the pump inlet. These systems lower the effective GVF of the multiphase fluid below 95 percent in order to increase the pump efficiency. The first objective is to characterize the performance of a twin-screw pump fitted with a <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> system while operating under high GVF conditions. The second objective is to investigate the transient heat rise associated with high GVF operation. While traditional twin-screw pumps can be fitted with a <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> system to allow them to operate under high GVF conditions the pumps themselves are not optimized for wet gas compression and still suffer performance penalties. The results of this investigation show that the <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> system can allow the pump to operate under high GVF but the heat added to the system reduces the systems efficiency. Without a method of removing the heat generated in the pumping process the pump will not run at its optimal efficiency.

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} is used {{to convert}} unusable waste such as livestock manure, wastewater, solid waste and food waste into valuable end products such as biogas. Wastewater treatment plants are required to intensify wastewater digestion process using existing digester capacity by processing concentrated sludge, which affects digester mixing performance. There have been many studies on digester hydrodynamics, but digester mixing is still carried out based on empirical evidence rather than fluid mechanical studies. The main objective of this work {{is to determine the}} optimum mixing method/s for digesters using a hydrodynamic study. This involved a model liquid to represent sludge. Flow visualisation and electrical resistance tomography (ERT) are employed in this work. Also, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are developed and validated using flow visualisation experimental data. All experiments were conducted in a 0. 19 m diameter cylindrical tank. Three mixing systems, namely mechanical mixing, <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> and gas sparging, were implemented. Xanthan gum Keltrol-T (XGKT) solution was selected as the model liquid because its rheological characteristics are similar to digester sludge. Specific power inputs ranging from 3. 5 to 10. 5 W/m 3 were employed. Dye tracer and brine solution were used as tracers in flow visualisation and electrical resistance tomography (ERT) techniques respectively. Inactive mixing volume was determined by measuring the volume of the coloured and low conductivity regions in flow visualisation and ERT experiments, respectively. Experimental results show that the total inactive volume in the model digester decreases with increasing mixing time and reaches a plateau. Larger inactive volume was found in solutions with higher apparent viscosity regardless of the mixing mode used. Increasing power input beyond a certain value was found to have no influence in the reduction of inactive volume in <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> and gas sparging. In case of mechanical mixing, a threshold power input is required to achieve an acceptable value of the active volume. Experiments with <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> and gas sparging systems were conducted with different nozzle orientations to study their effect on inactive volume reduction. Downward jet in <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> system produces the largest inactive volume, and upward and angled jets lead to smaller inactive volumes. In gas sparging system, the downward sparger with a low tank bottom clearance leads to the smallest inactive volume. Therefore, the position and orientation of fluid inlet nozzles are very important in the design and operation of digesters processing thicker sludge. ERT can be used to estimate the shape and size of the active mixing region. It provides information on the inactive volume reduction rate and the final dead volume up to a certain level of accuracy depending on the mixing system. However, the estimations require further investigations and improvements. Overall, ERT has the potential of being used in the study of inactive volume in real sludge. CFD models are developed only for mechanical mixing and <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> systems. The models estimate the flow patterns and the inactive volume fairly well.

The general objective of this research was to evaluate the potential of headspace gas monitoring and control of fixed-film anaerobic digesters. ^ Laboratory-scale fixed-film anaerobic digesters treating a synthetic soluble carbohydrate waste were used. Trace gases, hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and final gases, methane and carbon dioxide, were monitored on-line. The effects of <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> on the rate of gas transfer from the generation site to the headspace of the reactor were evaluated. It was found that <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> rates do not affect mass transport rates significantly. Gas transport was primarily taking place by rising bubbles. Methane and carbon dioxide were transported from the bubbles to the surrounding liquid, whereas hydrogen was transported from the liquid to the bubbles. The rate of substrate uptake by the biofilm was significantly affected by <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> rates. ^ The responses of trace gases to toxic stress by cadmium and formaldehyde were evaluated. Trace gases proved to be sensitive indicators of toxic stress. Comparison with previous studies revealed that fixed-film digesters were several times more resistant to toxicity than suspended-growth digesters. Adaptation to formaldehyde was fast and degradation of the compound was consistently observed. ^ On-line control of effluent COD concentration using headspace parameters was possible when changes in influent strength were imposed to the system. ^ A new parameter for digester monitoring was proposed in this study. The new parameter was named the methanogenic activity index, MAI. The MAI provides a simple criterion to determine when the reactor is reaching its maximum loading rate and also, provides a clear signal of the occurrence of toxicity events in the process. ...|$|R

Results showded that for a test period of 65 days, triethylamine removal efficiencies of more than 98 % were obtained for EBRT of 156 s and loading rates of less than 48 g/m 3 /h. With an EBRT of 52 s removal efficiencies of> 90 % were obtained for loadings of < 57 g/m 3 /h and maximum removal capacity was 53. 4 g/m 3 /h at volumetric loading of 64 g/m 3 /h.

40|$|A {{two-phase}} anaerobic {{system is}} generally considered as advantageous over a single-phase system as phase separation of the acidogenic and methanogenic processes in the two-phase system can be capitalized for high OLR operation and process efficiency. This can be particularly true for wastes with a large rapidly biodegradable fraction, such as fruit and vegetable waste (FVW). This {{study was conducted to}} assess and compare the reactor stability and process performance of a single-phase system with two-phase system for fruit and vegetable waste. A conventional single-phase reactor was used and compared with a two-phase reactor system, which consisted of an acidification reactor and a methanogenic reactor, with solids and <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation.</b> The operation of acidification reactor was based on decoupling of the solids retention time from the hydraulic retention time and the digestate from acidification reactor was centrifuged, followed by recirculation of solids back to the reactor. The separated liquid was fed to the methanogenic reactor for methane production and the methanogenic effluent was recirculated back to the acidification reactor. This strategy of solids recirculation was to increase the solids retention time and thereby enhance the degradation of organic matter. Recirculation of methanogenic effluent was to provide alkalinity, maintain a constant solids concentration in the reactor and for possible enhancement of solids hydrolysis. The initial inoculation conditions of the single phase and the two-phase acidification reactor were similar. The single-phase reactor was operated at low loading rates of 2 then 3. 5 kg/m 3 d and the acidification reactor was operated with step-wise increase in the loading rate up to 10 kg/m 3 d. A new strategy was developed to convert methanogenic sludge to acidification sludge in a short time at this high OLR and with total recirculation of solids, followed by operation under acidification conditions. The acidification reactor achieved stable performance at 7. 0 kg VS/m 3 d and an optimum pH of 5. 5 - 6. 2 with very high substrate solubilization rate. Overall methane yield and VS removal were 0. 30 m 3 CH 4 /kg VS fed and 98 % in the two-phase system and 0. 47 m 3 CH 4 /kg VS fed 83 % in the in the single-phase reactor. Material balance and energy yield calculations for the two processes showed that the two-phase system was inferior in terms of volumetric methane production and energy yield by 33 %. Loss of energy during hydrolysis in the acidification reactor and lower methane production in the methanogenic reactor contributed to the lower energy yield.

Its configuration is inspired from airlift systems. It consists of a 60 -l reactor made of an internal airlift system coupled to an external <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> loop. Hollow fiber membranes are submerged in the riser compartment. The process was intermittently fed with a synthetic ammonia solution and the gas holdup evolution was monitored for 500 to 600 days. Experiments were performed using flowrates ranging from 0. 4 to 1. 03 Nm 3 /h, and from 0 to 0. 6 m 3 /h for air and water, respectively. This corresponded to superficial velocities from 0. 004 to 0. 03 m. s 1 for air and 0 to 0. 011 m. s 1 for water. The gas holdup g was directly measured by the volume expansion method, using a tubular level meter located on the plant. The reported results showed that, in the absence of microorganisms, g ranged between 0. 5 and 5. 5 % for the investigated range of gas liquid superficial velocities, whilst increasing from 0. 5 to 4. 8 % only in the presence of gas (no <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation).</b> This double influence of the air and the liquid velocities on the gas holdup was described by a multilinear correlation. However in the presence of biosolids in the reactor, the gas holdup raised up to 6. 5 %, corresponding to an increase of ca. 48 % (in average, with respect to data recorded on day 0). This increase in g was attributed to both a gas entrainment effect and an impact of the bioparticles recirculated into the reactor. Under experimental conditions investigated, the gas holdup increased linearly with the air and the liquid velocities, what corresponded to the bubbly flow regime in the system. This showed that, according to investigated conditions, the impact of circulated biomass was not enough to change the bubble gas flow regime. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Four different concepts are being investigated: no-bleed, low-bleed, {{use of a}} <b>recirculation</b> <b>line,</b> and He bubbling. A full-scale test article, which is a facsimile of a propellant feed duct with an attached section to simulate heat input from an LO 2 turbopump, is to be tested at the Cold Flow Facility of the Marshall Space Flight Center West Test Area. Work to date includes: design and fabrication of the test article, design of the test facility and initial fabrication, development of a test matrix and test procedures, initial predictions of test output, and heat leak calibration and heat exchanger tests on the test articles...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOne-dimensional {{modelling}} {{of global}} hydrodynamics and mass transfer is developed for an annulus sparged draft tube airlift reactor operating at high gas throughputs. In a first part, a specific closure {{law for the}} mean slip velocity of bubbles in the riser is proposed according for, in one hand, the collective effects on bubble rise velocity and, in the other hand, {{the size of the}} <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> in the airlift riser. This global hydrodynamics model is found to well explain the global gas volume fraction measurements in the airlift riser {{for a wide range of}} superficial gas velocity View the MathML source(0. 6 ≤JG≤ 10 cms− 1). In a second part, mass transfer in the airlift has been studied by using the gassing-out method and a dual-tip optical probe to measure the bubble size distributions. As for bubble columns, in such airlift, the volumetric mass transfer coefficient appears to be quite proportional to the gas superficial velocity. Finally, as in Colombet et al. (2011), mass transfer at the bubble scale seems to be weakly influenced by an increase of gas volume fraction...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{of three}} mixing systems (mechanical mixing, pumped <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> and gas mixing) was {{investigated}} in a laboratory scale model anaerobic digester. A transparent model fluid, xanthan gum Keltrol T (XGKT) solution was used to represent digested sludge due to their similarity in rheological characteristics. Mixing performance in 0. 15 and 0. 4 wt% XGKT solutions was investigated using a flow visualisation technique involving a decolourisation method {{with the assistance of}} a fluorescent dye tracer. A constant specific power input was used for all the three mixing systems. The changes in inactive mixing volume were determined as a function of mixing time for each system. The final inactive volumes in the three mixing systems were compared to determine their mixing efficiencies. Complete mixing with less than 5 % inactive volume was achieved in the 0. 15 wt% solution in all the three systems. However, a significantly large inactive volume remained undestroyed in the 0. 4 wt% solution. The mechanical mixing had the best performance in the 0. 15 wt% solution whereas the gas sparging system showed the best mixing efficiency in the 0. 4 wt% solution...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the accomplishment {{made during the}} second year of this cooperative research effort between Washington University, Ohio State University and Air Products and Chemicals. The technical difficulties that were encountered in implementing Computer Automated Radioactive Particle Tracking (CARPT) in high pressure SBCR have been successfully resolved. New strategies for data acquisition and calibration procedure have been implemented. These have been performed as a part of other projects supported by Industrial Consortium and DOE via contract DE- 2295 PC 95051 which are executed in parallel with this grant. CARPT and Computed Tomography (CT) experiments have been performed using air-water-glass beads in 6 inch high pressure stainless steel slurry bubble column reactor at selected conditions. Data processing of this work is in progress. The overall gas holdup and the hydrodynamic parameters are measured by Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) in 2 inch slurry bubble column using Norpar 15 that mimic at room temperature the Fischer Tropsch wax at FT reaction conditions of high pressure and temperature. To improve the design and scale-up of bubble column, new correlations have been developed to predict the radial gas holdup and the time averaged axial <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> velocity profiles in bubble columns...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{studied the}} {{start-up}} process of a mesophilic (37  ±  2  °C) anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR) operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 days using synthetic carbohydrate rich wastewater. Anox Kaldness-K 1 carriers {{were used as}} biofilm carrier material. The reactor performance and biofilm formation were evaluated during the process. The start-up process at lower <b>liquid</b> <b>recirculation</b> flow rate enhanced the biofilm formation and reactor performance. The organic substrate composition had {{a major impact on}} early colonization of methanogenic archaea onto the surface of the Kaldness carriers during the start-up process. Specific organic substrates favouring the growth of methanogenic archaea, such as acetate, are preferred in order to facilitate the subsequent biofilm formation and AFBR start-up. The supply of 'bio-available' nutrients and trace elements, in particular iron, had an important role on optimal methanogenic activity and speeding-up of the biofilm development on the Kaldness carriers. This paper provides possible strategies to optimize the various operational parameters that influence the initial biofilm formation and development in an AFBR and similar high rate anaerobic reactors, hence can be used to reduce the long time required for process start-up...|$|R
