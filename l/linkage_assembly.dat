The success of the prototype U1 over the N1 design led to a construction order for a further 20 locomotives to be built at Eastleigh in 1931. Despite the possible weight savings with the Holcroft valve gear, the complexity of maintaining the linkage with the inside cylinder meant that the new class members were fitted with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear for all cylinders. As had happened with the N1 class prototype No. A822, No. A890 was modified to this revised specification in 1930 to reduce maintenance costs. Prior to the modification of No. A890, the new locomotives were visibly different {{by the absence of}} the outside-to-inside valve <b>linkage</b> <b>assembly</b> and were given larger tenders with a water capacity of , although the slab-front was retained.|$|E

Over the pH range 7 - 9. 5 and the temperature range 15 - 30 degrees C, assembly is characterized by negative enthalpy and heat capacity changes and positive entropy changes. The dependence of the enthalpy and entropy changes on pH is complex; however, the negative heat capacity change results in both quantities becoming more negative with increasing temperature. Assembly is linked to the binding of protons; the effects observed can be fit to models involving six or more ionizable groups with pK values of 7. 3 - 7. 4, 8. 5 - 8. 8, and 9. 2 - 9. 5, which ionize cooperatively. Contributions from additional groups cannot be ruled out and are in fact expected. The overall pattern of thermodynamic effects implies a complex set of intersubunit interactions. Protonation reactions and increased hydrogen bonding are likely to be the major sources of the negative enthalpy change; however, the negative heat capacity change results primarily from changes in solvent structure associated with hydrophobic and electrostatic bond formation with changes in low-frequency vibrational modes making a secondary contribution. Similarly, the relatively small entropy change observed within the temperature range examined probably reflects the balance between positive contributions from increased hydrophobic and electrostatic bonding and negative contributions from increased hydrogen bonding and damping of low-frequency vibrational modes...|$|R

40|$|Layer-by-layer {{assembly}} {{has received}} much attention {{over the last}} fifteen years. This assembly process {{can be carried out}} using different methods including hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic, and to a lesser extent, covalent interactions. However, these assemblies are rarely seen on polyolefin substrates {{due to the lack of}} functionality on the surface. ?Click? chemistry has become very popular in recent years as a means to join modular compounds together. This thesis is the first published report to use ?click? chemistry as a means for layer-by-layer assembly on a polymeric substrate. By designing polymers that contain alkyne or azide groups, it is possible to assemble them layer-by-layer on a polyethylene substrate. Polymers based on tert-butyl acrylate were initially designed for use in organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran. The copper catalyst that facilitated the 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition was air sensitive and expensive. To capture the true essence of ?click? chemistry, a new system was designed based on N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM) -based polymers. These polymers were water soluble and allowed for ?click? chemistry to be performed in water and open to air in benign conditions. With the development of a water soluble polymer system that could be modified to contain either azide groups or alkyne groups, layer-by-layer assembly was carried out in water. A polyethylene film was modified in a series of reactions to have an alkyne-functionalized surface. The poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) -based polymers were layered in an alternating fashion to form multilayer assemblies. A series of control reactions were also performed, showing that these layers were interconnected via triazole <b>linkages.</b> These <b>assemblies</b> were monitored by attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy. Once the layers were assembled, the polyvalent nature of the polymers allowed for further functionalization. Various surface functionalizations were established using fluorescence microscopy and contact angle analysis. By using spectroscopic and chemical means, layer-by-layer assembly on polyethylene films was proven. Control reactions showed the necessity of components for triazole formation. Therefore, layer-by-layer assembly using ?click? chemistry was achieved...|$|R

We previously described such a network that forms upon Latrunculin A (LatA) treatment, in which formin DAAM 1 was localized at these nodes. Knock down of DAAM 1 reduced the mobility of actin nodes but the nodes remained. Here we have investigated DAAM 1 containing nodes after LatA washout. DAAM 1 was found to be distributed between the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane. The membrane binding likely occurs through an interaction with lipid rafts, but is not required for F-actin assembly. Interesting the forced interaction of DAAM 1 with plasma membrane through a rapamycin-dependent <b>linkage,</b> enhanced F-actin <b>assembly</b> at the cell membrane (compared to the cytoplasm) after the LatA washout. However, immediately after addition of both rapamycin and LatA, the cytoplasmic actin nodes formed transiently, before DAAM 1 moved to the membrane.

Thus, we suggest that DAAM 1 organizes actin filaments into a nodal complex, and such nodal complexes seed actin network recovery after actin depolymerization...|$|R

Based on the Galaxy framework, some workflows for the assembly of real sequencing data from different organisms and produced by the Illumina, SOLiD??? and 454 technologies were aggregated. Also, due to the applied characteristic of the project, a few punctual solutions were generated to address specific needs. Those solutions were encapsulated in the NGS: LASZLO's Sandbox module, a "toolbox" especially tailored for the de novo and reference-guided assembly approaches. During the research, the LASZLO @ GALAXY prototype processed, for instance, sequencing data of the Leishmania amazonensis organism, contributing for a first evaluating process of its genome. Presently, it's noticed that the data generation is no longer the "bottleneck" of the sequencing projects, but the downstream data analysis. Frequently, the acquired data is not immediately translated into biological knowledge expansion, due to the obstacles met by the experimental biologist when dealing, not only with the myriad of available tools, but also with factors like the inherent need of their integration and the deployment of the adequate infrastructure for their operation. The results achieved during project execution indicate that the proposed system, glimpsed as an eventual institutional service or even as one of smaller scope, might become an end-user's ally in the NGS data manipulation...|$|R
40|$|In {{design and}} {{manufacturing}} {{there are a}} lot of situations to make engineers to deal with products, which have redundant mechanical structures. This is a harmful effect that can produce non-solvable dimension chains at designing preproduction stage, and lead to rebasing in the course of assembly. Traditional means for mathematical description of mechanical structures, such as directed and undirected graphs, matrices, and etc., have no appropriate tools to identify redundancy and eliminate it. This can be achieved by using a relatively new mathematical model, i. e. a hyper-graph of mechanical linkages. It is shown that a necessary condition of redundancy is simple inequality X <R + 1, where X - the number of vertices, and R - the number of the hyper-graph edges. Eliminating the unnecessary mechanical <b>linkages</b> generates mechanical <b>assembly</b> structures with different assembly properties. The paper considers generation of non-redundant structures, which possess a maximum fractionalizing property. So-organized products can be broken up into the largest number of independently assembled fragments - assembly units. This simplifies the preproduction engineering and disassembly procedures in case of full or selective repairs during operation. It is shown that the normal sequence of assemblies enables us to reduce a mechanical structure of such products to the chain of a maximum length.   We propose an algorithm to eliminate redundancy. It generates the maximum fractionalizing mechanical structures. The algorithm is based on three heuristic rules that recommend eliminating edges, which disarrange a chain structure of the hyper-graph. The paper provides a rationale heuristics and considers a test case. To test the algorithm using a large array of examples, the experimental software has been developed. Computational experiments have been conducted using a sample of thirty redundant hyper-graphs randomly generated. The experiments have shown the highest relevance of the heuristic rules and algorithm reliability. </p...|$|R

Cellubiuronic acid is initiated on a lipid and is composed of alternating β- 1, 3 -Glc and β- 1, 4 -glucuronic acid (GlcUA) <b>linkages.</b> The entire <b>assembly</b> process is carried out by a polypeptide synthase thought to contain a single active site, suggesting that the donor specificity is controlled by the terminal nonreducing sugar in the acceptor subsite. Shortly after initiation, the synthase undergoes an allosteric transition accompanied by the tight binding of the nascent chain via its nonreducing oligosaccharide terminal segment to the carbohydrate acceptor recognition site. The chain length of polysaccharide assembled by recombinant synthase in Escherichia coli membranes was determined by an ejection mechanism that appeared to be a reversal of the allosteric transition of the synthase from the transitory to the fully processive state. The rates of both ejection and transition were shown to be highly sensitive to the concentration of UDP-GlcUA. As the concentration of UDP-GlcUA was increased, both the rate of synthesis and the processive turnover time increased. The product of the processive turnover time and the rate of synthesis predicted a marked increase in polysaccharide chain size (from 50 to 1150 kDa) over a relatively narrow concentration range of 1 – 11. 5 μm UDP-GlcUA. The kinetic model chain length predictions were in close agreement with chemically determined sizes of polysaccharides synthesized at the same UDP-sugar concentrations. The model indicates that translocation occurs following the addition of GlcUA to the chain terminus, whereas UDP-Glc drives chain termination when inadequate levels of UDP-GlcUA are present. In sum, type 3 synthase appears to modulate polysaccharide chain length by functioning as a concentration-dependent kinetic timing device...|$|R

Our approach to these natural products features a new and scalable method for erythro-[beta]-hydroxytryptophan amino acid synthesis, an intramolecular Friedel-Crafts reaction of a silyl-tethered indole, and a new mercaptan reagent for epipolythiodiketopiperazine (ETP) synthesis that can be unravelled under very mild conditions. In evaluating the impact of Cl 2 -hydroxylation, we have identified a unique need for an intramolecular variant of our Friedel-Crafts indolylation chemistry. Several key discoveries including the first example of permanganate-mediated stereoinvertive hydroxylation of the a-stereocenters of diketopiperazines as well as the first example of a direct triketopiperazine synthesis from a parent cyclo-dipeptide are discussed.

A major suture separates the Archean-Neoproterozoic Ruker Province from an inferred Grenvillian-age orogenic Gamburtsev Province with remarkably thick crust (up to 60 km thick) and thick lithosphere (over 200 km thick).

An over 1, 900 km long magnetic and gravity lineament is imaged along the western flank of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin and is interpreted here as a major Paleoproterozoic suture zone linked to the collision of Laurentia and East Antarctica within Columbia. The proposed suture {{played a pivotal role}} helping localise Neoproterozoic Rodinia rifted margin evolution and forming a backstop for the Ross-Delamerian cycle of Gondwana amalgamation.

It {{is the most common}} bacterial cause of sinusitis, otitis media and community acquired pneumonia and also a major cause of invasive diseases such as septicaemia and meningitis. Rarely bacteraemia is associated with cardiac complications, such as endocarditis and pericarditis. Pneumococci are also frequent colonizers of the nasopharynx of healthy children attending day-care centers and may be considered as mucosal commensals of the nasopharyngeal microflora. The aim of this thesis was to investigate pneumococcal adhesion factors and other cell wall properties involved in the interaction with the human host in regard to colonization, virulence, and treatment. Clinical isolates, from patients hospitalised with a pneumococcal bacteraemia associated with a pneumococcal endocarditis or pericarditis, were collected and analysed. An associated condition such as pneumonia, sinusitis, meningitis or sepsis, appeared to be a prerequisite for disease, and was present in all cases. In the study we found that streptococci seem to require pre-existing endothelial lesions in order to adhere to cardiac valves and cause endocarditis. We could not find any specific virulence attributes, such as capsular types or adhesive properties in the examined isolates. A novel pilus-like structure was found on the surface of pneumococci, encoded by the rlrA pathogenicity islet. The rlrA islet contains the genes rlrA, encoding the positive regulator, rrgA, rrgB, rrgC, encoding three structural pili subunits and srtB, srtC, srtD, encoding three sortases involved in the <b>linkage</b> and <b>assembly</b> of the pilus structure. We found that the pilus shaft consists of a polymer of RrgB subunits with RrgC as the tip protein. RrgA is distributed in intervals along the shaft and monomers are also associated with the pneumococcal cell wall. The pilus is one of the major, but not the only, adherence factor to lung epithelial cells. We show that RrgA is the major adhesion among the pilus proteins. However, the pilus as such does no seem to be essential for in vitro adherence as long as RrgA is present. Our observations also show, that RrgA is the major protein involved in virulence and pathogenicity, inducing earlier death and high levels of TNF and IL- 6 in murine infection models. Lysis is a characteristic feature of pneumococci. We examined contributions of cell wall charge and pH alterations on LytA-dependent stationary phase and antibiotic induced lysis. An exogenous pH below 6 or fermentation of glucose and subsequent low pH levels in the growth medium effectively abolished lysis but not growth or death of the bacteria. Pneumococcal cell wall pH levels were detected by FITC emission. We could not find any significant pH changes in the cell wall of bacteria in liquid cultures. However, a biofilm model in which non-encapsulated T 4 R and T 4 RdeltalytA attached as monolayers, showed that treatment with penicillin G, vancomycin or valinomycin (a proton motive force dissipator), but not the non-lytic erythromycin, led to an instant pH shift. This pH shift was dependent upon endogenous H 20 2 production as it required an intact pyruvate oxidase gene, spxB, and could be prevented with exogenous addition of catalase...|$|R
40|$|Activation of the {{complement}} cascade {{and subsequent}} {{assembly of the}} membrane attack complex (MAC) occur {{in a number of}} pathophysiological settings. When formed on the surface of endothelial cells in sublytic concentrations, the MAC can induce a number of proinflammatory activities, including the secretion of soluble mediators (eg, interleukin (IL) - 8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) - 1) and the up-regulation of cell surface adhesion molecules. Available data indicate that MAC-induced cell activation may occur through several complex signal transduction pathways, but {{little is known about the}} intranuclear mechanisms by which complement-derived products promote the up-regulation of inflammatory mediators. Using purified distal complement proteins (C 5 - 9) to assemble functional MAC on early-passage human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we examined mechanisms of MCP- 1 and IL- 8 induction. Formation of sublytic concentrations of MAC promoted an increase in nuclear factor (NF) -kappa B DNA binding activity within 60 minutes as determined by serial electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Cytosolic to nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B was confirmed by Western immunoblot and immunocytochemical analyses. Formation of the C 5 b- 8 complex also promoted NF-kappa B translocation but to a lesser degree than observed in HUVECs containing complete MAC. No cytosolic to nuclear translocation of the p 65 NF-kappa B subunit was observed in unstimulated HUVECs or in cells incubated with the MAC components devoid of C 7. Preincubation of HUVECs with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate prevented MAC-induced increases in IL- 8 and MCP- 1 mRNA concentrations and protein secretion. A direct cause and effect <b>linkage</b> between MAC <b>assembly</b> and NF-kappa B activation was established through examination of the pharmacological effect of the peptide SN 50 on IL- 8 and MCP- 1 expression. SN 50 is a recently engineered 26 -amino-acid peptide that contains a lipophilic cell-membrane-permeable motif and a nuclear localization sequence that specifically competes with the nuclear localization sequence of the NF-kappa B p 50 subunit. This study provides direct in vitro evidence that the distal complement system (MAC) can promote proinflammatory endothelial cell activation, specifically, increases in IL- 8 and MCP- 1 mRNA concentrations and protein secretion, and that cytosolic to nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B is necessary for this response...|$|R
