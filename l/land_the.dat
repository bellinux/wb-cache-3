5|$|Much of {{the land}} {{near the mouth of}} Mahoning Creek is developed. A strip of land {{crossing}} the watershed in its central section is also developed.

5|$|A {{cultivator}} of olives, Davenport {{had planted}} {{a limited number}} of olives around Beaumont House in 1852 after he purchased the <b>land</b> <b>the</b> year before. Davenport later expanded his groves by replanting trees and cuttings from Beaumont both {{in other areas of the}} allotment and at some of his other properties in the Adelaide Hills. He also planted mulberry trees for producing silk on the estate grounds.|$|E
5|$|Also nearby was the Shoemaker family, which owned {{substantial}} {{tracts of}} land in both the District and in Maryland. Three forts or portions of forts were built on their property: Fort Simmons, Fort Mansfield, and Battery Bailey. Despite the loss of much of their <b>land,</b> <b>the</b> Shoemaker family continued to operate a local general store and sold various sundry items to the garrison at Fort Bayard.|$|E
5|$|An amphibious {{landing at}} Mersing was {{originally}} planned by the Japanese to sever {{the lines of}} communication between the British forces and Singapore, but the Southern Expeditionary Army Group decided to <b>land</b> <b>the</b> rest of the 18th Division at Singora instead, believing that the Allied defences at Mersing were too formidable. Although ground forces captured Endau on 21 January, they lacked the strength to break through the Australian defences at Sungei-Mersing.|$|E

5|$|Both {{in water}} and on <b>land,</b> <b>the</b> newts are largely nocturnal. In their aquatic habitats, they hide under vegetation, and on land, they use {{structures}} such as logs, rocks, or small animal burrows for cover. They feed mainly on different invertebrates, but in the water may also prey on tadpoles and smaller newts. Predators include herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and various carnivorous mammals.|$|E
5|$|Building and {{expansion}} continued up to World War I, {{by which time}} the orphanage occupied 150 acres (600 dunam) of <b>land.</b> <b>The</b> Schneller grounds reached {{all the way to}} present-day Romema, where Schneller planted forests on land that eventually housed the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo. The orphanage’s holdings were gradually reduced to 17.5 acres with the sale of land to the new neighborhoods of Mekor Baruch and Kerem Avraham.|$|E

5|$|By 1880 {{the estate}} {{had been broken}} up into fifteen smaller farms. The rough {{northern}} meadows adjacent to the Moselle were used for beef farming, whilst the southern fields, known as Grainger's Farm, were used as grazing <b>land.</b> <b>The</b> {{western edge of the}} estate was by this time occupied by the Great Eastern Railway's Palace Gates Line and Green Lanes railway station, opened in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{in farming}} practices, {{especially}} the drainage of <b>land,</b> <b>the</b> more intensive use of grassland and {{the removal of}} hedgerows, has affected wildlife in Wales. The causes of the decline are complex and factors such as climate change also play a part.|$|E
5|$|Despite American {{hunger for}} <b>land,</b> <b>the</b> {{leadership}} in the Minnesota Territory did not actually want to remove the Sioux from the territory.

5|$|Expecting an {{imminent}} {{continuation of the}} battle, three Allied brigades arrived within twenty-four hours to reinforce the beachhead, but no subsequent attack materialised. Instead, on 20 and 24 May two truces were declared to collect the wounded and bury the dead in no man's <b>land.</b> <b>The</b> Turks never succeeded in capturing the bridgehead; instead the ANZACs evacuated the position {{at the end of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Epsilon {{strengthened}} {{further to}} tie for the second-strongest December hurricane on record with 85mph winds at its peak, and it lasted {{longer than any}} other hurricane ever to form in December.

5000|$|The sea is {{warmed by}} the sun to a greater depth than <b>the</b> <b>land</b> due to its greater {{specific}} heat. [...] The sea therefore has a greater capacity for absorbing heat than <b>the</b> <b>land,</b> so <b>the</b> surface of the sea warms up more slowly than <b>the</b> <b>land's</b> surface. As <b>the</b> temperature of the surface of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> rises, <b>the</b> <b>land</b> heats <b>the</b> air above it. The warm air is less dense and so it rises. This rising air over <b>the</b> <b>land</b> lowers <b>the</b> sea level pressure by about 0.2%. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher sea level pressure, flows towards <b>the</b> <b>land</b> into <b>the</b> lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast. The strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between <b>the</b> <b>land</b> and <b>the</b> sea. If the environmental wind field is greater than 8 kn and opposing {{the direction of a}} possible sea breeze, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.|$|R
