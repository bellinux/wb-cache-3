40|$|This paper {{analyses}} farm household {{strategies and}} investment behaviour of Bulgarian farmers {{with a particular}} focus on the perceived effects of Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). The survey {{is based on a}} sample of 83 Bulgarian farms, carried out during 2007 by the Institute of Agricultural Economy (IAE). The farms were selected from 6 <b>less</b> <b>favourite</b> <b>areas</b> in the country which participate in a pilot project aiming to pre-test the effect of direct payments on different farm types. Based on this, three farm types with different specialisation (arable crops, livestock and vegetables), all implementing conventional technology were chosen. The survey includes information about farm and household structure, expectations, reaction to planned and intended investment. Direct payments are normally used in the farm with aim to cover current costs and investment expenditure. JRC. J. 5 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|E
40|$|Economies {{in rural}} regions are characterised {{by a wide}} range of {{economic}} activities and that in 1990 even in the most rural regions of economically developed countries the agricultural sector accounted for less than 20 % of regional labour force (OECD). Non-agricultural activities become dominant in rural regions. Among others, rural tourism and agri-tourism belong to the most frequent types of these activities in rural areas. However prerequisites and conditions for sustainable regional development and rural and agri-tourism differ between countries economy with long tradition of market economy and countries with transition economies. There are many factors behind this difference, when intensive character of agricultural production even in <b>less</b> <b>favourite</b> <b>areas,</b> which was typical for these areas in transition economies still a few years ago, is one of decisive. The article addresses the problem of evaluation of sustainable regional development and evaluation of rural and agritourism in the context of various world regions. The three dimensions of sustainable development, the environmental, the economic and the social dimension are equally important and should not be ranked or separated. Indicator systems and evaluation methods have the potential to {{play a significant role in}} the decision making process at a regional level. They can form the basic information that is necessary to allow strategic planning as well as informed participatory processes for the decision among different pathways into the future...|$|E

50|$|Twenty housemates {{entered the}} Gran Hermano house. They were {{split in two}} {{different}} houses, White house (House 1) and Color house (House 2). 9 women entered the color house and 9 men entered the white house. Rubén and Chari were ex, she entered {{the white house and}} Rubén entered the color house. All housemates had to get know each other by blind dates and after that chose their <b>favourites</b> or <b>less</b> <b>favourites.</b> On Day 5, women from color house chose their 4 favorite men from white house. Men from white house chose their 4 <b>less</b> <b>favourite</b> women from color house. Chari and Rubén's secret were discovered so they had to change house. On Day 47, the house was unified. On Day 82, five ex-housemates, Chari, Mireia, Oscar, Ruben, and Yago, returned to the Color House after an online public vote; a second round of online public voting on Day 89 decided for Ruben and Yago to officially return to the Gran Hermano house as official housemates; the other three housemates were re-evicted.|$|R

40|$|AbstractCompanies {{typically}} select {{those projects}} that maximize their profit {{as the primary}} criterion, within the limited budget at their disposal. This criterion may lead to some company departments getting an exceedingly large share of the overall budget and induce a negative perception of unfairness among the <b>less</b> <b>favourite</b> ones. We investigate how profit optimization can be sought after while achieving the desired level of fairness at the same time. Adopting a maximin approach to fairness and using an Integer Linear Programming solver, we show that a linear trade-off is possible, since fairness and profit exhibit a nearly perfect linear anticorrelation. Fairness can be improved by even a relatively small reduction of profit, especially in large companies (i. e., managing {{a large number of}} projects) ...|$|R

30|$|A weak {{labour market}} and an {{inadequate}} {{social protection system}} characterise this landscape. In particular, the young and women are <b>less</b> <b>favourite</b> in the labour market. The former typically have access to less stable and worse paid jobs. The latter can hardly reconcile family tasks with work. Among workers, only specific categories are supported in case of job loss or income decrease, particularly middle-aged employees in medium-large size firms. This situation is worsened by a welfare system that relies heavily on family ties {{and that does not}} address the needs of worse-off households through either universal or means-tested policies. The territorial dualism in terms of persistent poverty is partly explained by an even less favourable labour market in the South, characterised by higher unemployment rates, combined with a more traditional division of roles and the subsequent lower women’s commitment to paid work.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a rationale for}} consulting with very young children to enable their voices to be heard, and taken into consideration, when planning pre‐school provision. It goes on {{to suggest that the}} expressed preferences of pre‐school children can be taken as an accurate account of their thoughts and feelings. This is tested through a case study of six 4 ‐year‐olds in a nursery setting. The research enabled a comparison to be made between what the children said were their <b>favourite</b> <b>areas</b> of nursery life, and their preferences as noted by adults. In five out of six cases, adult perspectives were the same as child perspectives. The paper ends with some exploration of the factors that contribute to reliable consultation with very young children...|$|R

Theoretical part describes children with special needs, process of socialization and their integration with the majority in the classroom. The final results, shown through the sociograms and sociometirc tables, are the result of sociometric questionnaire. The scholars needed to give an answer to two specific questions and choose between all scholars three <b>favourite</b> and three <b>less</b> <b>favourite</b> scholars. Formed questions are; regarding the positive criteria „Write down three names from your class-mates, you would wish the most to go on a trip with“ and regarding the negative criteria; „Write down the names of the three classmates you would not wish to spend your free time with“. The analysis of research have shown, regarding the sociometric questionnaire, that most of the children with special needs are being less socially accepted from the majority of the classmates within the class. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{visit to}} the museum is a real {{aesthetic}} experience where the visitors feel themselves like living a spiritual moment linked to {{the beauty of the}} artworks. Aesthetic perception derived by artwork is a complex interplay of cognitive, emotional, behavioural and physiological responses. Previous studies showed that also psychological components could be responsible of aesthetic experience, so the aim of our research is to explore if, in addition to the psychophysiological level, the personality traits could have effects during exploration of different museum spaces. Our sample was composed by 18 participants (M = 23, 8; DS = 1, 4). They were asked to freely explore for 10 minutes each areas, starting randomly from one of the two spaces: “Leonardo Space”, a traditional museum area which contains models of Leonardo’s inventions and its drawing; “Spacial Space”, an interactive area which contains multimedia devices and objects about space like shuttles and spacesuits. During the exploration, we measured electrophysiological (by EEG) and autonomic (by Biofeedback) responses; then the participant completed a test of personality, the Big Five Questionnaire 2. After a correlational analysis, we found a significantly negative correlation between the score of Agreeableness of BFQ- 2 and alpha band activity in the left frontal cortex during the exploration of the “Leonardo Space”. We suggested that subjects with higher values of Agreeableness paid more attention to Leonardo’s models with an activation of the reward system (left frontal cortex). People tried to understand the mind of the artist. Then we found a significantly negative correlation between the score of Extroversion of BFQ- 2 and SCL (Skin Conductance Level), and between the score of Extroversion of BFQ- 2 and PULS (heart rate) during the vision of the models of Leonardo da Vinci’s works. Increasing the values of Extroversion, subjects were more concentrated seeing the models of Leonardo’s inventions. Extroverted people, who are dynamic, imaged the movement and the function of Leonardo da Vinci’s creations. Finally, we found a significantly negative correlation between the score of Conscientiousness of BFQ- 2 and SCL, and between the score of Conscientiousness of BFQ- 2 and PULS during the sight of the <b>less</b> <b>favourite</b> artefact of “Leonardo Space”. Subjects were more concentrated seeing the artefact <b>less</b> <b>favourite</b> of “Leonardo Space”. Conscientious people looked meticulously the artefact less pleasant because they are scrupulous, and they have more rational view...|$|R

Yet when I read them over again since their composition, I own I found them considerably better than I expected, and I think, if other circumstances do not crush them and blight their popularity, they will make their way. Mr. Cadell is still desirous to acquire one-half of the property {{of this part of}} the work, which is chiefly my own. He proposes assembling all my detached works of fiction and articles in Annuals, so that the whole, supposing I write, as is proposed, six new volumes, will run the collection to fifty, when it is time to close it. Between cash advanced on this property, and a profit on the sale of the second part, Mr. Cadell thinks, having taken a year or two years' time, to gather a little wind into the bag, I will be able to pay, on my part, a further sum of £30,000, or the moiety remaining of the whole debts, amounting now to less than £60,000.|$|R
40|$|With {{the present}} article, I {{would like to}} {{illustrate}} the long period of classical librarianship and classical processing of library materials prior to the invasion of computer technology and new way of catalog composition into libraries. In the classical period of the processing of library materials, author catalogs were formed by one or several authors while in the frames of computer processing of library materials, multi-author catalogs are being produced. In the čase of an author catalog, a consistent UDC scheme exists and the author's manner of classification and editing of the catalog can be recognized. Such a catalog discloses its author: his education in a special field of knowledge and in other scientific fields, his mastering of general scientific sistematics, his mastering of the špirit in systematics of the UDC system not to resort to formal classification. The catalog also reveals {{the extent of the}} author's democracy through the way he treats his <b>favourite</b> and <b>less</b> <b>favourite</b> authors, places, events,phenomena, ideologies etc. In my opinion, aH the mentioned should be described and documented because passing tirne slowly but persistently destroys everything and everything which is not being documented, passes into oblivion...|$|R
