40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, the authors introduced {{the idea of}} a <b>symmetric</b> <b>pair</b> of operators as a way to compute self-adjoint extensions of symmetric operators. In brief, a <b>symmetric</b> <b>pair</b> consists of two densely defined linear operators A and B, with A ⊆ B^ and B ⊆ A^. In this paper, we will show by example that <b>symmetric</b> <b>pairs</b> may be used to deduce closability of operators and sometimes even compute adjoints. In particular, we prove that the Malliavin derivative and Skorokhod integral of stochastic calculus are closable, and the closures are mutually adjoint. We also prove that the basic involutions of Tomita-Takesaki theory are closable and that their closures are mutually adjoint. Applications to functions of finite energy on infinite graphs are also discussed, wherein the Laplace operator and inclusion operator form a <b>symmetric</b> <b>pair.</b> Comment: 17 page...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{develops}} a {{general theory of}} quantum group analogs of <b>symmetric</b> <b>pairs</b> for involutive automorphism of the second kind of symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras. The resulting quantum <b>symmetric</b> <b>pairs</b> are right coideal subalgebras of quantized enveloping algebras. They give rise to triangular decompositions, including a quantum analog of the Iwasawa decomposition, {{and they can be}} written explicitly in terms of generators and relations. Moreover, their centers and their specializations are determined. The constructions follow G. Letzter's theory of quantum <b>symmetric</b> <b>pairs</b> for semisimple Lie algebras. The main additional ingredient is the classification of involutive automorphisms of the second kind of symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras due to Kac and Wang. The resulting theory comprises various classes of examples which have previously appeared in the literature, such as q-Onsager algebras and the twisted q-Yangians introduced by Molev, Ragoucy, and Sorba.
