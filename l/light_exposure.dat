40|$|The uptake of {{horseradish}} peroxidase (HRP) into membranous structures, detectable by light and electron microscopy, is used here {{to monitor the}} synaptic activity of photoreceptors of isolated frog retinas maintained in the dark or under various illumination conditions. The major findings are: (a) Neurotransmission from photoreceptor terminals seems to involve {{the same types of}} endocytic membrane-retrieval processes that occur at other nerve terminals. Presumably, the endocytic processes compensate for exocytic events associated with neurotransmission. The retrieved membrane is "recycled" to form vesicles. Some of these accumulate near the synaptic ribbons, perhaps indicating reutilization for exocytosis. On the other hand, some retrieved membrane evidently is degraded via multivesicular bodies that appear to undergo "retrograde" transport from the receptor synapses to the myoid regions. (b) Photoreceptor terminals take up much HRP in the dark. Steady illumination markedly decreases uptake by rods. Uptake by cones is notably reduced only at illumination intensities higher than those that have maximal effects on rods. (c) The decrease in rod HRP uptake with light is reversible when retinas are allowed to adapt to the dark, if the <b>light</b> <b>exposures</b> used were at intensities that bleach very little visual pigment. Such "recovery" is not observed after <b>light</b> <b>exposures</b> that bleach a considerable amount of visual pigment. The cones recover their dark levels of HRP uptake even after <b>light</b> <b>exposures</b> that bleach considerable amounts of visual pigment. The changes in HRP uptake that we observe parallel expectations for photoreceptor synaptic neurotransmission derived from indirect physiological evidence...|$|R

40|$|The {{short-term}} {{influence of}} visual experience was {{studied in the}} first-order tetrad synapses of the first optic neuropil, or lamina, underlying the compound eye in the housefly (Musca domestica). We report the effects of single light reversals, in which flies reared in constant darkness were exposed to light or those in constant light were exposed to darkness, on this defined population of synapses. The synaptic population was characterized by quantitative electron microscopic methods using three parameters: (i) the number of synaptic contacts per photoreceptor terminal; (ii) the size of these synapses, given by the mean platform width of their presynaptic ribbons; and (iii) the proportion (up to approximately 20 %) of small synapses-those having a ribbon platform less than 0. 17 micron wide. The effects of <b>light</b> <b>exposures</b> in flies reared in constant darkness include decreased mean synaptic size and increased numbers of synapses. These effects are seen in flies of all ages (to 10 days). Long <b>light</b> <b>exposures</b> (2 - 6 h) are much less effective than short exposures (down to 20 s), with maximum effects obtained at 15 min (up to 45 % more synapses). Small synapses are reasoned to be new junctions formed only recently; the decreased mean synaptic size and the increased number of synapses seen after short <b>light</b> <b>exposures</b> are both interpreted to result from a recent burst of synaptogenesis in the adult lamina. The effects of dark exposure in flies reared in constant light are the reciprocal of those seen in dark-reared flies exposed to light, but they are less pronounced. Although the function of such changes is not yet known, they may form part of the light adaptation mechanism of the photoreceptor, and occur along with a redistribution of other organelles involving membrane invaginations into its terminal. These changes occur against a background trend for control flies reared under constant conditions to have fewer, larger synapses with increasing age up to 10 days, an effect that is most pronounced in constant darkness, when synaptic number decreases by 21 % and size increases by 13 %...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe brain {{processes}} light {{information to}} visually represent the environment {{but also to}} detect changes in ambient light level. The latter information induces non-image-forming responses and exerts powerful effects on physiology such as synchronization of the circadian clock and suppression of melatonin [1, 2, 3]. In rodents, irradiance information is transduced from a discrete subset of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells via the retinohypothalamic tract to various hypothalamic and brainstem regulatory structures including the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei, the master circadian pacemaker [4, 5, 6]. In humans, light also acutely modulates alertness [7, 8], but the cerebral correlates of this effect are unknown. We assessed regional cerebral blood flow in 13 subjects attending to auditory and visual stimuli in near darkness following <b>light</b> <b>exposures</b> (> 8000 lux) of different durations (0. 5, 17, 16. 5, and 0 min) during the biological night. The bright broadband polychromatic light suppressed melatonin and enhanced alertness. Functional imaging revealed that a large-scale occipito-parietal attention network, including the right intraparietal sulcus, was more active {{in proportion to the}} duration of <b>light</b> <b>exposures</b> preceding the scans. Activity in the hypothalamus decreased in proportion to previous illumination. These findings have important implications for understanding the effects of light on human behavior...|$|R

Some seeds germinate best after a fire. For some seeds, fire cracks hard seed coats, while in others, chemical dormancy is broken in reaction to the presence of smoke. Liquid smoke is often used by gardeners to assist in the germination of these species.|$|E
25|$|If {{angiosperm}} shoots are not {{exposed to}} the required light for chloroplast formation, proplastids may develop into an etioplast stage before becoming chloroplasts. An etioplast is a plastid that lacks chlorophyll, and has inner membrane invaginations that form a lattice of tubes in their stroma, called a prolamellar body. While etioplasts lack chlorophyll, they have a yellow chlorophyll precursor stocked. Within {{a few minutes of}} <b>light</b> <b>exposure,</b> the prolamellar body begins to reorganize into stacks of thylakoids, and chlorophyll starts to be produced. This process, where the etioplast becomes a chloroplast, takes several hours. Gymnosperms do not require light to form chloroplasts.|$|E

Susceptibility of certain wine grape varieties were found to increase as the grapes reached higher Brix sugar levels. Further research in the 2000s, showed that some of the open canopy techniques used to prevent Botrytis grey rot may actually promote the development of some of these other types of rot. Ripe rot, in particular, seemed to thrive at the higher ultraviolet B (280–320nm) <b>light</b> <b>exposure</b> that open canopies allow.

25|$|Exposure to light, {{physical}} damage, and age increase glycoalkaloid content {{within the}} tuber. Cooking at high temperatures—over —partly destroys these compounds. The concentration of glycoalkaloid in wild potatoes suffices to produce toxic effects in humans. Glycoalkaloids may cause headaches, diarrhea, cramps, and in severe cases coma and death; however, poisoning from potatoes occurs very rarely. <b>Light</b> <b>exposure</b> causes greening from chlorophyll synthesis, thus giving a visual {{clue as to}} areas of the tuber that may have become more toxic; however, this {{does not provide a}} definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other.

Since then breeders developing new varieties test for this, and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising cultivar.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the bottom}} is rising, {{fringing}} reefs can grow around the coast, but coral raised above sea level dies and becomes white limestone. If the land subsides slowly, the fringing reefs keep pace by growing upwards on a base of older, dead coral, forming a barrier reef enclosing a lagoon between the reef and the land. A barrier reef can encircle an island, and once the island sinks below sea level a roughly circular atoll of growing coral continues {{to keep up with}} the sea level, forming a central lagoon. Barrier reefs and atolls do not usually form complete circles, but are broken in places by storms. Like sea level rise, a rapidly subsiding bottom can overwhelm coral growth, killing the coral polyps and the reef, due to what is called coral drowning. Corals that rely on zooxanthellae can drown when the water becomes too deep for their symbionts to adequately photosynthesize, due to decreased <b>light</b> <b>exposure.</b>|$|E
