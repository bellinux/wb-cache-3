5|$|In {{the late}} 16th century, {{during the reign}} of Stefan Batory (1576–1586), a peasant-based levy formation, piechota wybranicka (<b>lit.</b> drafted or {{selected}} infantry, also known as piechota łanowa, <b>lit.</b> acreage infantry) was formed. It was based on peasants from the royal estates only, who received a unit of land (łan) in exchange for their service. The formation numbered about 2,300 and after early disappointments was never seen as of much military value. It supplemented the few small units of haiduk infantry, which saw service in Poland primarily around late 16th and 17th centuries. In 1655 a new infantry unit was created, the żołnierz dymowy (or żołnierz łanowy– <b>lit.</b> chimney or łan soldier, named again after the type of tax applied). It required all lands, no matter whether owned by king, nobles or the Church, to provide peasant recruits, and applied a similar requirement to towns.|$|E

The solution was a modified primus stove (designed by a friend of Andrée's) that could be dangled 8m (26ft) below the crew and then <b>lit</b> from the basket, at a safe distance. An angled mirror attached to the specially designed stove allowed the crew to determine whether it was successfully <b>lit</b> or not.|$|E
