40|$|Both <b>loop</b> fancy <b>yarns</b> and frotte fancy yarns {{belong to}} the group of yarns with {{continuous}} effects. The difference between frotte and <b>loop</b> <b>yarn</b> relies {{on the fact that the}} <b>loop</b> <b>yarn</b> is constructed with two core yarns and the frotte yarn is constructed with only one core yarn. The differences are evident in the shape of these two types of fancy yarns. These shape differences are the functions of the tensions of component yarns during the twisting process. The shape and construction of the fancy yarn influence its properties. The properties of loop and frotte fancy yarns, woven and knitted fabrics are compared in this article in order to find out the optimal yarn’s and fabric’s production condition to satisfy the final user and maintain low production costs. In terms of economy aspects only, the frotte fancy yarns are believed to be cheaper in production due to lower quantity of components utilize for their production to compare with <b>loop</b> fancy <b>yarns,</b> under conditions of the same settings of ring twisting frame...|$|R
50|$|Bouclé, or <b>looped,</b> <b>yarns</b> {{are created}} by loosely <b>looping</b> an effect <b>yarn</b> around a base yarn. They can be made of any type of fiber and are usually {{composed}} of three plies, or strands, wrapped around each other. The texture is created by spinning {{one of the three}} plies more loosely than the other two. Fiber artists who choose to create projects in bouclé yarn must use extra care because if not handled carefully, the loose strand may split and snag on the knitting needles or crochet hook.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{balanced}} method for realistic rendering of towels and carpets from a normal viewing distance. Since the <b>yarn</b> <b>loops</b> {{on the surface}} of a towel contribute more to the appearance of a towel than the underneath skeleton yarns do, we model <b>yarn</b> <b>loops</b> with more accurate geometry and lighting models. To show the randomness {{in the shape of a}} <b>yarn</b> <b>loop,</b> we control the shape of <b>yarn</b> <b>loops</b> by bilinear patches. To keep the continuity between the shapes of neighboring <b>yarn</b> <b>loops,</b> we determine the vertices of a bilinear patch by both the underneath towel stitch pattern and a turbulence function. We also present a reasonably simplified method to ray trace the a <b>yarn</b> <b>loop</b> volume. In our ray-tracing method, only one intersection point needs to be calculated for each incident ray. Both our lighting model and geometry model can also be applied to other layered objects (e. g. fur and grasses). ...|$|R

50|$|Knitting is {{the process}} of using two or more needles to <b>loop</b> <b>yarn</b> into a series of {{interconnected}} loops {{in order to create a}} finished garment or some other type of fabric. The word is derived from knot, thought to originate from the Dutch verb knutten, which is similar to the Old English cnyttan, to knot. Its origins lie in the basic human need for clothing for protection against the elements. More recently, hand knitting has become less a necessary skill and more a hobby.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the sensing behavior of various textile structures made of stainless steel continuous filament yarns for their potential measurement applications for large strain under high temperature. Four knitting structures are designed and tested. It is observed that the resistance change of the fabrics depends on the structure, the shift of the loop decreasing and the change of the contact resistance between yarns increasing are help to the repeat and sensitivity of the relative resistance change respectively. The relative resistance change also depends on the loading condition, such as strain rate, the maximum cycle strain and temperature. In our four knitting structures, single warp-knit has better repetition in strain sensing than the other three structures, this is because the loops in single warp-knit possess a stabilized behavior, and the plastic deformation is the smallest. The mechanisms of this strain sensing behavior have been investigated including the relationships between electrical resistance of yarn and yarn tensile strain, between yarn length transfer in the strain fabric and the fabric tensile strain, as well as contact resistance of the <b>looped</b> <b>yarns.</b> The major contributor has been deduced to be the change of contact resistance between <b>looped</b> <b>yarns</b> during the deformation...|$|R

50|$|Knitting creates {{multiple}} <b>loops</b> of <b>yarn,</b> called stitches, {{in a line}} or tube. Knitting {{has multiple}} active stitches on the needle at one time.

40|$|The author {{conducted}} {{several experiments}} using {{three kinds of}} sewing thread，cotton 	thread，polyester spun thread and polyester filament thread，in order to reveal how tensile 	angle influenced their mechanical properties. These properties are important to predict the 	seam strength in curved sewing，particularly in attaching sleeves to ablouse. 	Taking the tensile angle into account，t he obtained data from the experiments were 	converted to the actual values and discussed. The results are listed below. 	 1) As the tensile angle of each thread was increased，th e loop strength decreased gradually， 	whi 1 e the elongation slowly increased. The tendency was noticeable above a tensi 1 e angle 	of around 50 - 60 degrees. Thus a strong negative correlation was acknowledged between 	the loop strength and the elongation in each thread. 	 2) The ratios of the strength and elongation between the single and <b>loop</b> <b>yarn</b> remained 	basically constant regardless of tensile angle {{for all of the}} threads tested. The cotton 	thread had the largest ratio with the polyester spun thread second and the polyester 	filament thread third through all of the tensile angles. 	 3) The loop toughness of the polyester spun thread and the polyester filament thread was 	larger than that of the cotton thread. The toughness of each thread grew little by little with 	the tensile angle，and was strongly correlated with the loop strength and the elongation...|$|R
40|$|Spirality is a {{particularly}} serious problem for plain knitted fabrics due to asymmetric loops. This study investigates {{the relationship between the}} spirality of plain wool knits and various variables. The experimental results show that the twist factor of two-ply wool yarn is the most important factor influencing fabric spirality. Loop length and fiber diameter also show significant effects. In general, increasing the twist factor of two-ply <b>yarn,</b> <b>loop</b> length, and fiber diameter increases the angle of spirality. The experimental results demonstrate that relaxation treatment of fabrics in water decreases the angle of spirality. The experimental data also lead to the derivation of empirical equations linking the angle of spirality to the twist factor of two-ply <b>yarn,</b> <b>loop</b> length, and fiber diameter in both the dry relaxed and simulated industrial relaxed states.

2500|$|Crochet ( [...] ; [...] ) is {{a process}} of {{creating}} fabric by interlocking <b>loops</b> of <b>yarn,</b> thread, or strands of other materials using a crochet hook. The name is derived from the French term crochet, meaning 'small hook'. These are made of materials such as metal, wood, or plastic and are manufactured commercially and produced in artisan workshops. The salient difference between crochet and knitting, beyond the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in crochet is completed before proceeding with the next one, while knitting keeps a large number of stitches open at a time. (Variant forms such as Tunisian crochet and broomstick lace keep multiple crochet stitches open at a time.) ...|$|R

40|$|Rotor spun yarn, {{despite its}} growing popularity, suffers the {{disadvantages}} of lower tenacity, limited count range, and harsh {{handle of the}} resulting fabrics. Therefore, this work probes the possibility of eliminating these drawbacks by using tensile drawing. The yarns are produced with different specifications from the same fibers. The results are encouraging, since contrary to predictions, staple yarns treated this way do perform properly. Tensile drawing especially improves rotor spun yarn quality in terms of structural/mechanical evenness and processability. Other features include increased packing density, reduced yarn diameter, enhanced mechanical rigidity, and even the potential for larger tenacity. The influence of processing variables on yarn properties is also revealed by examining {{the contribution of the}} number of <b>yarn</b> <b>loops</b> mounted on the feed roller and rewinding to drawing and the resulting products. The number of <b>yarn</b> <b>loops</b> wound on the feed roller is significant in terms of drawing tension. Optimum drawing can be obtained without rewinding in terms of better yarn properties and economics, though rewinding can effectively eliminate fiber breakage. Moreover, the truely critical factor in the drawing extent should be drawing tension rather than the so-called drawing ratio. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
