60|$|As her motor car, with a swift smoothness, {{carried her}} along the Embankment towards the <b>lattice</b> <b>bar</b> of Charing Cross {{bridge and the}} remoter towers of the Houses of Parliament, grey now and unsubstantial against the bright western sky, her mind came back slowly to her {{particular}} issues in life. But {{they were no longer}} the big exasperatingly important things that had seemed to hold her life by a hundred painful hooks before she went into the cathedral. They were small still under this dome of evening, small even by the measure of the grey buildings to the right of her and the warm lit river to her left, by the measure of the clustering dark barges, the teeming trams, the streaming crowds of people, the note of the human process that sounds so loud there. She felt small even to herself, for the touch of beauty saves us from our own personalities, makes Gods of us to our own littleness. She passed under the railway bridge at Charing Cross, watched the square cluster of Westminster's pinnacles rise above her until they were out of sight overhead, ran up the little incline and round into Parliament Square, and was presently out on the riverside embankment again with the great chimneys of Chelsea smoking athwart the evening gold. And thence with a sudden effect of skies shut and curtains drawn she came by devious ways to the Fulham Road and the crowding traffic of Putney Bridge and Putney High Street and so home.|$|E
40|$|Buildup of {{internal}} self-stresses in hyperstatic adaptive structures resists actuation. A recent paper by Guest and Hutchinson shows that periodic infinite truss structures cannot be both statically and kinematically determinate structures; therefore, a rigid infinite <b>lattice</b> <b>bar</b> framework must be hyperstatic. This paper {{shows that it}} is possible to design adaptive periodic infinite truss structures that can achieve any state of uniform strain without energy cost by actuating only a subset of the bars in a coordinated fashion. We show that actuation of only 3 bars in two dimensions or 6 bars in three dimensions per unit cell is required. A mathematical apparatus is developed and an example of such a bitriangular lattice structure is given, along with accompanying illustrations.

TiAl 6 V 4, medical implants can be produced. To increase osseointegrative behavior {{the ability to}} fabricate filigree lattice structures can be utilized to achieve a modified implant surface. In order to increase dimensional accuracy when applying a lattice structure on a curved surface, process constraints for single <b>lattice</b> <b>bars</b> are studied. The investigated lattice structure was thereupon applied {{on the surface of}} a medical implant...|$|R
60|$|It {{consisted}} of two lines of strong girders on each side, connected by <b>lattice</b> <b>bars,</b> with strong communications between the sides at each pier. The depth of the girders was some twenty feet. After cautiously feeling the wall and finding {{that there were no}} openings in which their explosives could be placed, they crawled away noiselessly, ascended to the bank again a couple of hundred yards from the bridge, and returned to their camping ground. They observed as they went that there were still fires burning in the station yard, that some Kaffirs were seated near these, and as, in the silence of the night, a faint sound could be heard like that of a distant train, they had no doubt that they were waiting up for one to arrive. Indeed, before they had reached the camping place they saw a train pass by. It had no lights save the head- lights and that of the engine fire, and they therefore had no doubt that it was another train with stores.|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of a low-profile antenna array with a multicrystalline silicon solar cell capable of powering a low-power wireless sensor at 2. 45 GHz is reported. <b>Lattice</b> bus <b>bars</b> {{on the cell}} are exploited to minimize antenna shadows from low-profile antennas and transmission lines for a higher output power. The dual inverted-F array improves gain, and beam switching enables the array to sweep a wider coverage angle with larger beamwidths compared to other solar integrated antennas...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{also had}} elements designed to draw parallels to {{the experiences of}} those Canadians incarcerated during World War II: the 2 storey windows in the main hall have <b>lattice</b> reminiscent of <b>bars,</b> and rain water is directed off the roof using chains attached to stones on the ground.|$|R
60|$|At mid-day she arose, hearing {{upon the}} stair the {{step of the}} woman who brought her food, and to hide her tear-stained face went to the <b>barred</b> <b>lattice</b> and looked out. The scene was dismal indeed, for the wind had veered suddenly, the snow had ceased, and in place of it rain was falling with a steady persistence. When the woman had gone, Elsa washed her face, and {{although}} her appetite turned from it, ate of the food, knowing how necessary it was that she should keep her strength.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We derive a {{constitutive}} {{law for the}} myocardium {{from the}} description of both the geo-metrical arrangement of cardiomyocytes and their individual mechanical behaviour. We model a set of cardiomyocytes by a quasiperiodic discrete <b>lattice</b> of elastic <b>bars</b> interacting by means of moments. We work in a large displacement framework and we use a discrete homogenization technique. The macroscopic constitutive law is obtained through the resolution of a nonlinear self-equilibrum system of the discrete lattice reference cell.

50|$|It {{is a small}} {{building}} with two-foot-thick sandstone walls, and was built by contractor Elija W. Fannin. Its only ventilation is by its doorway and by a small window, 12 x 6 in in size, which has two sets of iron bars in it. Its door is a <b>lattice</b> of iron <b>bars,</b> which cost $55.65 from the firm of Sengel and Shulte. The jail has its original dirt floor, but has a newer roof, now covered in corrugated tin. It is significant as the only remaining artifact of the Skullyville County Government in the Choctaw Nation; a courthouse located {{to the north of}} the jail was burned in 1949.|$|R
40|$|Structural {{analysis}} {{consists of}} determining the forces and displacements generated by elements acting on the structure. Manual methods of structural analysis generally are excessively time-consuming, making them unsuitable for most practical problems and calling {{for the use of}} computational methods. This paper describes the development of a software application for the analysis of forces and displacements of plane or spatial <b>lattices</b> formed by <b>bar</b> elements. In order to improve the interaction between the user and the program, a graphical interface was developed to optimize data entry and allow the altering or expansion of a previously-analyzed lattice with greater ease and control. The computational implementation used the displacement method to determine forces and displacements due to external loads acting on the lattice. Commercial software SAP 2000 v 15 is used to compare results...|$|R
5000|$|Surface {{features}} in a material produce {{variations in the}} CTR intensity, which can be measured and used to evaluate what surface structures may be present. Two examples of this are shown in Fig. 3. In {{the case of a}} miscut at an angle , a second set of rods is produced in reciprocal space called superlattice rods, tilted from the regular lattice rods by the same angle, [...] The X-ray intensity is strongest in the region of intersection between the <b>lattice</b> rods (grey <b>bars)</b> and superlattice rods (black lines). In the case of ordered alternating steps, the CTR intensity is chopped into segments, as shown. In real materials, the occurrence of surface features will rarely be so regular, but these two examples show the way in which surface miscuts and roughness are manifested in the obtained diffraction patterns.|$|R
60|$|He gives a vivid {{description}} of the scene that evening. In the centre was a garden raised on arches lit by festoons of lights and connected with the Rows by eight graceful bridges, beneath which hummed the interlacing streams of motor traffic, pulsating as the current alternated {{between east and west}} and north and south. Above rose great frontages of intricate rather than beautiful reinforced porcelain, studded with lights, barred by bold illuminated advertisements, and glowing with reflections. There were the two historical music halls of this place, the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, in which the municipal players revolved perpetually through the cycle of Shakespeare's plays, and four other great houses of refreshment and entertainment whose pinnacles streamed up into the blue obscurity of the night. The south side of the square was in dark contrast to the others; it was still being rebuilt, and a <b>lattice</b> of steel <b>bars</b> surmounted by the frozen gestures of monstrous cranes rose over the excavated sites of vanished Victorian buildings.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of simulating position estimation from a camera-based system integrated in a hand-held mine detector. The system reports positions of the sensor head relative to a bar placed on the ground by the deminer to indicate the safe limit. Monitoring the position during sensor scanning enables image reconstruction of the captured signals. Image representation allows object shape analysis and easy target localization. The simulation has considered several configurations including one or two cameras, one or no accelerometer and a 1 or 2 -dimensional reference <b>lattice</b> on the <b>bar.</b> The required accuracy of the positioning system in our application is +/- 0. 5 cm in each direction. 1.

40|$|SYMP ON SIGE BASED TECHNOLOGIES, AT THE 1992 SPRING CONF OF THE EUROPEAN MATERIALS RESEARCH SOC, STRASBOURG, FRANCE, JUN 02 - 04, 1992 International audienceIn {{order to}} study Si-Ge substitutions, Six-Ge 1 -x talcs (0 < x < 100) were {{synthesized}} at 200 -degrees-C with various octahedral (nickel, cobalt or magnesium) cations. X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveals, {{in spite of}} different silicon and germanium cation sizes, preservation of the usual C 1 <b>BAR</b> <b>lattice</b> symmetry group of silicon talcs for germanium talcs. An increase in the cell volume and a rotation of tetrahedra (to adjust tetrahedral and octahedral lateral sheet dimensions) are observed for Si-Ge talcs when the germanium content increases. Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectroscopy reveals, with increasing germanium content, a continuous evolution of band positions towards lower frequencies, indicating a tetrahedral solid solution. According to XRD and FTIR results, germanium can easily substitute for silicon on the tetrahedral sheet of clay minerals...|$|R
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} structures generally {{refers to}} beams, co- lumns and walls which are constituted by complex <b>lattices</b> of steel <b>bars</b> {{embedded in a}} concrete matrix, exhibiting multiple cracks due to high external loads. This paper presents the for- mulation of a numerical model aimed at describing the frac- ture process in reinforced concrete, from the volumetric ratio of concrete and steel. Crack formation and propagation in a composite material is described in the model by an enhanced strain field, such as that established in the continuum strong discontinuity approach and mixture theory. The composite material is constituted by a concrete matrix {{and one or two}} steel bar orthogonal packages. The steel and concrete are re- presented by a one-dimensional plasticity model and a scalar damage model having different tension and compression strength, respectively. The dowel action and the bond-slip effects between the bars and the matrix are described with additional models relating component material stress and strain. It is concluded that the proposed model can easily be implemented in the finite element method, due to several conventional nonlinear numerical process characteristics which remain. The model would also allow the problem to be analysed at macroscopic scale, thereby avoiding a finite e- lement mesh having to be constructed for each component material and its interaction effects and reducing computa- tional costs...|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{remodeling}} {{is important}} in cellular processes like vesicle trafficking, organelle shaping, movement or division. In Drosophila the membrane-shaping N-BAR protein amphiphysin {{is involved in the}} biogenesis and stabilization of deep invaginations of the sarcolemma, the T-tubules, crucial for the excitation-contraction coupling machinery in striated muscles. Drosophila amphiphysin mutants are viable but flightless due to a disorganized T-tubule network. However, details of the amphiphysin membrane interaction the underlying molecular mechanism how amphiphysin is remodeling and maintaining tubular membrane shapes and the three dimensional structure of the amphiphysin assembly are unknown. In this study I structurally characterized the helical arrangement of Drosophila amphiphysin on membrane tubes by using cryo-EM. I found that the BAR domain cooperatively self-assembles to a helical arrangement on the membrane surface. The cryo-EM 3 D reconstruction of amphiphysin N-BAR-mediated tubes provided first structural insights into the unique and well-connected helical amphiphysin BAR assembly. One tip of the crescent-shaped BAR dimer is immersed into the membrane whereas the other tip is protruding outwards from the tube surface. In addition, it seems that the regulatory domains with a SH 3 domain of amphiphysin are not involved in the membrane remodeling process. The helical <b>BAR</b> <b>lattice</b> is well-connected by laterally locking BAR domains in adjacent lattice rows via the H 0 helix and by tip-to-center interactions of neighboring BAR domains in one lattice row. The H 0 helix is insignificant for the membrane remodeling activity but essential for the fast initiation of the helical BAR polymerization and for the formation of a rigidly organized BAR arrangement on the tube surface. Mutations at the tip region or _H 0 helix mutants showed impaired tube remodeling activity and a disorganized helical BAR arrangement. This suggests that the H 0 helix as well as the BAR tips are crucial for an efficient and organized BAR assembly on the tube surface. I observed that amphiphysin N-BAR-mediated tubes are more rigid and uniform as endophilin N-BAR-mediated tubes, contributing to the dynamic membrane scission process in endocytosis. The cooperative BAR self-assembly and the unique and well-connected BAR arrangement on membranes give insights into the molecular mechanism of membrane shaping by amphiphysin and its ability to maintain the shape of T-tubules...|$|R
40|$|We apply a simulational proxy of the phi-value {{analysis}} and perform extensive mutagenesis experiments {{to identify the}} nucleating residues in the folding "reactions" of two small <b>lattice</b> Go () over <b>bar</b> polymers with different native geometries. Our findings show that for the more complex native fold (i. e., {{the one that is}} rich in nonlocal, long-range bonds), mutation of the residues that form the folding nucleus leads to a considerably larger increase in the folding time than the corresponding mutations in the geometry that is predominantly local. These results are compared to data obtained from an accurate analysis based on the reaction coordinate folding probability P-fold and on structural clustering methods. Our study reveals a complex picture of the transition state ensemble. For both protein models, the transition state ensemble is rather heterogeneous and splits up into structurally different populations. For the more complex geometry the identified subpopulations are actually structurally disjoint. For the less complex native geometry we found a broad transition state with microscopic heterogeneity. These findings suggest that the existence of multiple transition state structures may be linked to the geometric complexity of the native fold. For both geometries, the identification of the folding nucleus via the P-fold analysis agrees with the identification of the folding nucleus carried out with the phi-value analysis. For the most complex geometry, however, the applied methodologies give more consistent results than for the more local geometry. The study of the transition state structure reveals that the nucleus residues are not necessarily fully native in the transition state. Indeed, it is only for the more complex geometry that two of the five critical residues show a considerably high probability of having all its native bonds formed in the transition state. Therefore, one concludes that, in general, the phi-value correlates with the acceleration/deceleration of folding induced by mutation, rather than with the degree of nativeness of the transition state, and that the "traditional" interpretation of phi-values may provide a more realistic picture {{of the structure of the}} transition state only for more complex native geometries.
