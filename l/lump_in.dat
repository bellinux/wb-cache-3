5|$|Neuroblastoma (NB) {{is a type}} {{of cancer}} that forms in certain types of nerve tissue. It most {{frequently}} starts from one of the adrenal glands, but can also develop in the neck, chest, abdomen, or spine.

5|$|Betty {{has gained}} weight {{over the past}} few months, causing her self-worth to drop and her sex life with Henry to flatline. This prompts an {{intervention}} of sorts from Henry's mother, Pauline, who suggests diet pills. When Betty goes to the doctor's office in an attempt to obtain diet pills, the doctor refuses. After a routine examination, he finds a possibly cancerous <b>lump</b> <b>in</b> Betty's throat. Betty returns home in a hysteric fever. She calls Don, who reassures her. Betty begins to confront the legacy of her life and the effect her death would have on her loved ones. Several days later, the doctor calls back to tell her the tumor is benign. Henry holds a despondent Betty in his arms. She ponders her life as simply a sad, fat housewife.|$|E
5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} of stomach pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard <b>lump</b> <b>in</b> his stomach. At this point there was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E

5|$|She {{applied to}} {{participate}} in the CBS reality competition show The Amazing Race 16 with NASCAR Truck Series driver Jennifer Jo Cobb as her teammate but both were cut from the program. Robinson was invited to donate memorabilia to the NASCAR Hall of Fame but did not send anything because of her commitment to audition for The Amazing Race 16. She was involved with the planning and decorating for Kelley Earnhardt Miller's marriage in 2011. In March 2014, Robinson was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer, which she was told had also spread to her lymph nodes. She underwent treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy which caused 18 lymph nodes and a <b>lump</b> <b>in</b> her breast to be removed. Robinson was cared for by her mother-in-law for seven months. Her friends ran her businesses on her behalf, and Earnhardt Miller along with Dale Earnhardt Jr., ran fundraising events to help Robinson pay her medical bills. She later entered remission, and completed her final radiation treatment in September 2015.|$|E

Signs {{of breast cancer}} may include a <b>lump</b> <b>in</b> the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.|$|E

Cancer can also occur in the thyroid after spread from other locations, in which case it is not classified as thyroid cancer.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reported}} symptom {{complex of}} breast cancer is Paget's disease of the breast. This syndrome presents as skin changes resembling eczema, such as redness, discoloration, or mild flaking of the nipple skin. As Paget's disease of the breast advances, symptoms may include tingling, itching, increased sensitivity, burning, and pain. There may also be discharge from the nipple. Approximately half of women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the breast also have a <b>lump</b> <b>in</b> the breast.|$|E

It was made with two layers of horn, wood or bone sandwiching the tang, each overlaid with a thin metal plate. Often the hilt was decorated with inlaid silver.

An expansion or <b>lump</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the handle made the user's grip even more secure.|$|E

25|$|The pre-procedure mammograms were {{negative}} for malignant neoplasms. The types of anaesthesia applied were general (two patients) and epidural analgesia plus sedation, with local infiltration and intercostal nerve blocks (15 patients). The autologous adipocyte tissue was grafted in one-to-three stages; the average volume of a tissue-graft was 278.6cm3 {{of fat per}} operation, per breast. Post-procedure, each patient was instructed to regard any <b>lump</b> <b>in</b> the breasts as unrelated to the fat grafts, until after a complete medical workup of the breast lump had been performed. Moreover, the study Cell-assisted Lipotransfer for Cosmetic Breast Augmentation: Supportive Use of Adipose-Derived Stem/Stromal Cells (2007), about a 40-woman cohort, indicated that the inclusion of adipose stem cells to the grafts of adipocyte fat increased the rate of corrective success of the autologous fat-grafting procedure.|$|E

25|$|In 1970, he was {{appointed}} as the second Deputy Prime Minister, replacing Tun Abdul Razak, who had been elevated to Prime Minister following the resignation of Tunku Abdul Rahman. Shortly before, Ismail had become privy to the secret that Abdul Razak was suffering from leukaemia. Only Razak's doctors, Razak and Ismail knew of Razak's health problems, with Razak often using the pretext of paying Ismail a visit at his home to be examined by doctors at a hidden building near Ismail's house. Not long after, Ismail himself discovered a <b>lump</b> <b>in</b> his neck while shaving – the lump was later confirmed to be cancerous. As a result, many within Ismail's family urged him to retire again. However, Ismail considered it his duty to assist Abdul Razak as Deputy Prime Minister, and thus refused to resign, delaying the treatment for his neck cancer and refusing an operation on his heart valves to continue working.|$|E
25|$|Jane Emily Goward {{was born}} in Wakefield in Yorkshire in 1964, the sixth of ten {{children}} of a dentist. When she was aged 11, the family emigrated to Australia but returned after three years. In 1990, Tomlinson applied to study Mathematics at the University of Leeds. However, when she found a <b>lump</b> <b>in</b> her breast and had a lumpectomy, she enrolled instead at Leeds General Infirmary and trained as a radiographer. By this time, she had married Mike Tomlinson and had two daughters, Suzanne and Rebecca. They later had a son, Steven. Qualifying in 1993, Tomlinson later studied to postgraduate level and became a paediatric radiographer. Three years after having a lumpectomy the cancer returned {{and she had a}} second mastectomy, and two rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In 2000, Jane Tomlinson was told that the cancer had spread to her bones and lungs, and was given about 12 months to live.|$|E
