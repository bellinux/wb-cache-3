5000|$|In the {{midpoint}} of his work is a - depending on the counting - 10-volume autobiographical novel cycle about the alter-ego figure [...] "Eugen Rapp", which began with Verlassene Zimmer Abandoned Room (1966) and concluded with Freunde Friends (1997). Almost without parallel in the German publications of 1945, this novel explores autobiographical events, and both cuts and captures the political history of Germany in the 20th century. Just as notable are the novels Andere Tage Days (1968) and Neue Zeit Age (1975), of the daily confrontation with the Third Reich. Lenz comes from an autobiographical concept ("Write as you are," [...] {{is one of the}} central maxims). It strives to accurately depict <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of a metaphysical background to indicate [...] "flow into each other past and present". In books like Lady and Executioner (1973) and Der Wanderer (1986) Lenz succeeded, again and again, with the autobiographical and merge of the transcendental component of his writing. As the most prominent stylistic device he uses here the form of [...] "internal dialogue", which makes the character perspective transparent and transferred to the reflections of the outside world directly into sensations. In addition to his novels, and Rapp occasionally published poetry submitted by Lenz, a large number of novels and short stories. These delve, like Die Begegnung Encounter (1979) and Memory of Edward (1981), into the 19th century world, or they design, as in the 1980 completed trilogy Der Innere Bezirk Inner District, conscious alternative plans for their own biography. Lenz occasionally followed narrative traditions, especially with The Double Face (1949) or Spiegelhütte ("Mirror Cabins") (1962), building on forms of magic realism.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} moral {{distress}} was first {{developed in the}} mid 1980 ?s by the American philosopher Dr. Andrew Jameton. Since then, moral distress has been studied in many health care practice settings and among various disciplines. However, moral distress among nurses in community health care settings has remained largely unexplored. Community health nurses (CHNs) work with clients, families, and communities {{with a variety of}} diverse care needs. Therefore, in this research I cast a wide net by asking a broad question, ?What guides us here?? What guides nurses through the ethical landscape of community health nursing? The purpose of this research, then, is to explore CHNs experiences of everyday ethical issues and moral distress and identify educational opportunities for ongoing learning and support. To do this I used a narrative inquiry approach and interviewed 20 Canadian CHNs by phone. Based on my analysis of the data, categories of key ethical issues, themes, and educational needs were explored and identified. From the interview data, participants? stories were then re-storied by me into meta-narratives. Nine meta-narratives, inspired by multiple-participant interview responses, were created as an end product of this study. The meta-narratives represent stories that are true to <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> regarding situations that the CHNs reported from their nursing practice. At the same time, however, the meta-narratives do not describe any one situation; rather they reflect aspects of several stories combined. Thus, the meta-narratives offer protection of confidentiality, provide an evidence-based, detailed account of these experiences, and are educational resources for CHNs. I also designed and had participants evaluate an educational intervention {{in the form of a}} self-directed e-learning module (e-module). Based on the research findings, I offer recommendations for action to promote ethical nursing practice and support CHNs, which include implications for education, theory, research, and nursing practice. This research provides foundational knowledge about the ethical landscape of community health nursing in Canada, the everyday ethical issues faced, experiences of moral distress, and educational opportunities to support CHNs...|$|E

My interest in uncertainty developed during the course of a fifteenmonth stay with David’s family in Chimtengo village, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rural Central Region of Malawi.

Musculoskeletal (MSK) disease is a significant burden on the aging population, contributing 7. 5 % of <b>the</b> disease burden <b>in</b> those aged over 60 years. MSK diseases have a pronounced effect on disability level and independence in old age, with a consequent significant public health burden and impact on quality of later life. As numbers of older individuals and their disease burden increase, {{it is important to}} examine MSK disease <b>in</b> older <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>detail.</b> <b>The</b> musculoskeletal aging phenotype comprises four often interwoven key elements ? osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, sarcopenia and frailty ? and this review will focus on these four themes.

Accurate measurement of the musculoskeletal aging phenotype is necessary firstly to document the burden of each condition, and then to enable factors to be identified which may accelerate or retard their development or progression. In some areas of MSK disease, this work is more advanced (osteoporosis); in other areas (sarcopenia) the field is currently very rapidly evolving.

40|$|The {{pioneers of}} dynamic Keynesian economics, Harrod and Kalecki, {{began with an}} {{analysis}} of the trade cycle, but are remembered for their contributions to growth theory. Unlike most twentieth century growth theory, they both had a major focus on disequilibrium situations and an examination of this aspect of their theory is the purpose of this paper. Harrod distinguished three stages in his dynamic analysis. The first was the derivation of the fundamental equation and consequent theorems. Fundamental meant underlying: even apart from random factors the equation may never hold exactly <b>in</b> real <b>life.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second stage, <b>detailed</b> analysis was made of <b>the</b> factors (<b>in</b> addition to <b>the</b> fundamental equation) which have a systematic effect on the path the economy follows. The final stage is policy prescriptions. Except in his 1936 book on the trade cycle, Harrod did relatively little “second stage” work but this did not stop him putting forward policy prescriptions. This three stage structure of analysis contributed to the widespread misunderstanding of the nature of his fundamental equation leading to a widely accepted view of a Harrod growth model which was completely different to what Harrod thought he was putting forward. Kalecki, on the other hand, rejected what Harrod had called “first stage analysis” as being of little interest. His main criticisms of growth theory were aimed at, what he saw, as the vacuousness of such theorising. Instead, his work concentrated on second and third stage analysis, that is, in attempting to understand the non-equilibrium, dynamics of the economy with a view towards policy prescription. For this reason, Kalecki’s contribution was less open to misunderstanding than was Harrod’s. ...|$|R
