5|$|By June 1942, the Manhattan Project {{had reached}} the stage where the {{construction}} of production facilities could be contemplated. On June 25, 1942, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) S-1 Executive Committee deliberated on {{where they should be}} located. Moving directly to a megawatt production plant looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> step, given that many industrial processes do not easily scale from the laboratory to production size. An intermediate step of building a pilot plant was considered prudent. For the pilot plutonium separation plant, a site was wanted close to the Metallurgical Laboratory, where the research was being carried out, but for reasons of safety and security, it was not desirable to locate the facilities in a densely populated area like Chicago.|$|E

25|$|You're {{sitting in}} the stands {{and you can see}} he's a big guy, but when I walked up to {{him for the first time}} face-to-face, I go, 'Wow, this is a big man.' He's big, but he has a really good swing. It's not <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> guy. It's short, compact. It's not just the home runs. The guy has a pretty good idea how to hit.|$|E
25|$|In a day/night {{match at}} St Lawrence Ground, Warwickshire captain Nick Knight sent Kent in to bat, and his South African pace bowler Dewald Pretorius took {{a flurry of}} wickets in good bowling conditions. Ending with five for 32, he took the first five wickets of the innings as Kent {{collapsed}} to 29 for 5, but South Africans Justin Kemp and Martin van Jaarsveld rebuilt quickly. Despite little support - no batsman apart from himself passed 25 - Kemp {{made his way to}} 84 off 93 balls, as Kent scrambled 177 for 9. In reply, Warwickshire got to 19 for 0, but a fiery spell from Martin Saggers yielded three wickets, as Nick Knight, Ian Bell and Jamie Troughton were all dismissed in single figures. Warwickshire's fifth-wicket partners saw off the opening bowling, however, and went after the part-timers instead, in chase of what suddenly looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> target of 178.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2011, Jawbone {{announced}} (and {{then paused}} production) of its lifestyle tracking system, UP by Jawbone. The UP wristband and accompanying app was first {{announced at the}} TED conference in Scotland in July 2011. Describing the company’s foray into health, Rahman told TechCrunch, “It seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> departure, but once we start talking about the things {{it takes to make}} this whole category work, we get into things like making it tiny, having a long battery life, making it fashionable, making it waterproof, working with smartphones, having a rich, visual experience on your smartphone and making it social. This is all stuff we do anyway. It comes back around to the mission of your mobile lifestyle.” Highly anticipated by Jawbone fans and the media, the UP lifestyle tracker and app system launched in November 2011. FastCompany Design reported, “If UP works, it could augur a huge shift in the way we approach weight loss and staying healthy.” Jawbone halted production of the product a month later in response to widespread customer claims of issues with charging, syncing, and in some cases, product failure. The guarantee, offered purchasers of UP full refunds for any reason, even if they wanted to keep their wristbands.|$|E

Kuhn is a wonderful batter and fields well enough in comparison with other Dixie infielders". For Blake, [...] "the best shortstop in the S. I. A.

MTV writer Kyle Anderson complimented the energy of the video and Shakira's dancing ability.

50|$|Although {{the virtue}} of the Lightning Bugs {{was that they were}} far more {{expendable}} than piloted reconnaissance aircraft, by early 1966 an average of four out of five Lightning Bugs failed to return from missions. This was unacceptable even for a relatively cheap drone, and the Air Force asked Ryan to quickly convert ten standard Firebee target drones to expendable decoys. They were fitted with traveling-wave tube (TWT) active radar enhancement devices to make them look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> aircraft on radar. There were no provisions for recovery or long-range fuel capacity, since their missions were to be one-way only.|$|R

500|$|The {{cast and}} crew were unhappy with the rock prop used in the episode.

500|$|Of {{the many}} Native American tribes that have {{lived on the}} Merced River the most {{prominent}} were the Miwok (consisting of Plains Miwok and Sierra Miwok), Paiute, and Ahwahnechee.

The Sierra (or Mountain) Miwok lived in the upper Merced Canyon and in Yosemite Valley, {{and at the time}} the first white explorers came to the area, there were about 450 Sierra Miwok split among ten permanent villages. Paiute, of origin from the eastern Sierra near the Mono Lake area, also lived in the upper watershed of the Merced River.
