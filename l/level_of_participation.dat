Other studies have suggested that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging to a religion.

Nevertheless, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year.

In collecting the information, thirty four full-time teachers in a Catholic school in Yogyakarta Indonesia are asked to evaluate the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> they actually have experienced. The gap between the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> they wanted and the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> they actually have experienced express their <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> satisfaction to their <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation.</b> Moreover, the teacher respondents are also asked to evaluate the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> Organizational Health they perceived. The result of the study show that the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation,</b> both teachers' desired participation and actual participation are not always significantly correlated to the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> Organizational Health they perceive. Such significant relationship between the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> and the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> Organizational Health only occur in some areas of decision making and some dimensions of Organizational Health. In addition, satisfied teachers and dissatisfied teachers are not always different in their perception <b>of</b> the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> Organizational Health.

2500|$|With {{the advent}} of the Union and the demise of Jacobitism, access to London and the Empire opened up very {{attractive}} career opportunities for ambitious middle-class and upper-class Scots, who seized the chance to become entrepreneurs, intellectuals, and soldiers. Thousands of Scots, mainly Lowlanders, took up positions of power in politics, civil service, the army and navy, trade, economics, colonial enterprises and other areas across the nascent British Empire. Historian Neil Davidson notes that “after 1746 there was an entirely new <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> by Scots in political life, particularly outside Scotland”. Davidson also states that “far from being ‘peripheral’ to the British economy, Scotland – or more precisely, the Lowlands – lay at its core”. British officials especially appreciated Scottish soldiers. As the Secretary of War told Parliament in 1751, [...] "I am for having always in our army as many Scottish soldiers as possible...because they are generally more hardy and less mutinous". The national policy of aggressively recruiting Scots for senior civilian positions stirred up resentment among Englishmen, ranging from violent diatribes by John Wilkes, to vulgar jokes and obscene cartoons in the popular press, and the haughty ridicule by intellectuals such as Samuel Johnson that was much resented by Scots. In his great Dictionary Johnson defined oats as, [...] "a grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people."
