5|$|Despite this, many post-grunge bands {{adopted a}} hard rock sound {{and in the}} 2000s there came a renewed {{interest}} in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes. Out of this movement came garage rock bands <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Stripes, the Strokes, Interpol and, later on, the Black Keys. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.|$|E
5|$|Of vertebrates, {{numerous}} {{species of}} frog, salamander, snake, turtle, and alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) proliferate in marsh waters. Most {{of these animals}} are active at night. Frog choruses are overwhelming; during alligator mating season the grunts of bulls join in. The marshes around the St. Johns River upper basin teem with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month, nesting or feeding in the upper basin. Wading and water birds <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> ibis (Eudocimus albus), wood stork (Mycteria americana), and purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinicus) depend on the water for raising their young: they prey upon small fish and tadpoles in shallow water and puddles in the dry season. In successful seasons, their colonies can number in the thousands, creating a cacophony of calls and fertilizing trees with their droppings.|$|E
5|$|On paper, the JNA {{seemed a}} {{powerful}} force, with 2,000 tanks and 300 jet aircraft (mainly Soviet or locally produced). However, by 1991, {{the majority of}} this equipment was 30 years old, as the force consisted primarily of T-54/55 tanks and MiG-21 aircraft. Still, the JNA operated around 300 M-84 tanks (a Yugoslav version of the Soviet T-72) and a sizable fleet of ground-attack aircraft, such as the Soko G-4 Super Galeb and the Soko J-22 Orao, whose armament included AGM-65 Maverick guided missiles. By contrast, more modern cheap anti-tank missiles (like the AT-5) and anti-aircraft missiles (like the SA-14) were abundant and were designed to destroy much more advanced weaponry. Before the war the JNA had 169,000 regular troops, including 70,000 professional officers. The fighting in Slovenia brought about {{a great number of}} desertions, and the army responded by mobilizing Serbian reserve troops. Approximately 100,000 evaded the draft, and the new conscripts proved an ineffective fighting force. The JNA resorted to reliance on irregular militias. Paramilitary units <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Eagles, Serbian Guard, Dušan Silni, and Serb Volunteer Guard, which committed a number of massacres against Croat and other non-Serbs civilians, were increasingly used by the Yugoslav and Serb forces. There were also foreign fighters supporting the RSK, mostly from Russia. With the retreat of the JNA forces in 1992, JNA units were reorganized as the Army of Serb Krajina, which was a direct heir to the JNA organization, with little improvement.|$|E

If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.|$|E
25|$|The Boston terrier breed {{originated}} around 1870, when Robert C. Hooper of Boston, {{purchased from}} Edward Burnett a dog named Judge (known later as Hooper's Judge), which {{was of a}} Bull and Terrier type lineage. Hooper's Judge is either {{directly related to the}} original Bull and Terrier breeds of the 19th and early 20th centuries, or Judge is the result of modern English Bulldogs being crossed into terriers created in the 1860s for show purposes, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> English Terrier. The American Kennel Club cites Hooper's Judge as the ancestor of almost all true modern Boston Terriers.|$|E
500|$|As {{with several}} of the songs previewed at Kinfauns, the Beatles did not revisit [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] during the White Album sessions. Harrison decided to give the song to former Undertakers singer Jackie Lomax – a fellow Liverpudlian {{and one of the}} first artists signed to the Beatles' record label, Apple Records, in early 1968. In a 2004 interview, Lomax said that he was {{fortunate}} to have Harrison's help, adding: [...] "even on a big project <b>like</b> <b>The</b> <b>White</b> Album he only had four songs.

500|$|The Doors {{wanted to}} {{capitalize}} on the experimental climate in popular music at the time that brought about groundbreaking works <b>like</b> <b>The</b> <b>White</b> Album and Electric Ladyland while redefining what could be accomplished within the rock medium. Looking for a new, creative sound, Rothchild hired Paul Harris to arrange string and orchestral arrangements for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and local jazz horn players. Session musicians Doug Lubahn and Harvey Brooks also served as additional bass guitarists. The music on The Soft Parade incorporated art rock, blues rock, jazz fusion, and psychedelic rock styles. Drummer John Densmore and Manzarek, who both had jazz backgrounds, asserted they were receptive to Rothchild's jazz concept: [...] "We'd [...] always talk about using some jazz musicians – let's put some horns and strings on, man, let's see {{what it would be like}} to record with a string section and a big horn section", recalled Manzarek.|$|E

2500|$|Valley oak is of {{the white}} oak {{evolutionary}} lineage, which is officially known as the subgenus Lepidobalanus. This subgenus comprises numerous oaks from California and elsewhere, which species share similar leaves, acorns, bark and wood pulp.

2500|$|The Black Paintings [...] of 1951 <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Paintings were {{executed}} on multiple panels and were single color works. Here Rauschenberg incorporated pieces of newspaper into the painting working the paper into the paint so that sometimes newspaper {{could be seen}} and in other places could not. By 1953-1954 Rauschenberg had moved from the [...] monochromatic paintings of the White Painting and Black Painting series, to the Red Painting series. [...] These paintings were created with diverse kinds of paint [...] applications of red paint, and {{with the addition of}} materials such as wood, nails, newsprint and other materials to the canvas created complex painting surfaces, and were forerunners of Rauschenberg's well-known Combine series.|$|E
2500|$|On November 7, 1939, Henry Standing Bear {{wrote to}} the Polish-American {{sculptor}} Korczak Ziolkowski, who worked on Mount Rushmore under Gutzon Borglum. He informed the sculptor, [...] "My fellow chiefs and I would <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> man {{to know that the}} red man has great heroes, too." [...] Standing Bear also wrote a letter to Undersecretary Oscar Chapman of the Department of the Interior, offering all his own fertile 900 acres (365 ha) in exchange for the barren mountain for the purpose of paying honor to Crazy Horse. The government responded positively, and the National Forest Service, responsible for the land, agreed to grant a permit {{for the use of the}} land, with a commission to oversee the project. Standing Bear chose not to seek government funds and relied instead upon influential Americans interested in the welfare of the American Indian to privately fund the project.|$|E
2500|$|Lev Grossman's New York Times best-seller The Magicians is a {{contemporary}} dark fantasy about an unusually gifted young man obsessed with Fillory, the magical land of his favourite childhood books. Fillory is a thinly veiled substitute for Narnia, and clearly the author expects {{it to be}} experienced as such. Not only is the land home to many similar talking animals and mythical creatures, it is also accessed through a grandfather clock {{in the home of}} an uncle to whom five English children are sent during World War II. [...] Moreover, the land is ruled by two Aslan-like rams named Ember and Umber, and terrorised by The Watcherwoman. She, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Witch, freezes the land in time. The book's plot revolves heavily around a place very like the [...] "wood between the worlds" [...] from The Magician's Nephew, an interworld waystation in which pools of water lead to other lands. This reference to The Magician's Nephew is echoed in the title of the book.|$|E

2500|$|As the 1970s began, Leonid Brezhnev allowed architects more freedom; soon, housing {{of varied}} design was built. Blocks of flats were taller and more decorated; large mosaics {{on their sides}} became a feature. In nearly all cases, these were built not as {{standalone}} construction {{but as part of}} large estates (...) which soon became a central feature of socialist cities. In contrast to the houses built in the 1950s-1960s, which had up to 5 floors, new residential buildings were higher and could have up to 9 or more floors, although the house with fewer floors continued to be built. Each complex includes an extensive area with a yard for walks, a playground with swings, a sandbox for the games and sites for parking vehicles, which are often supplemented by garages for cars, lined up separately from the residential buildings. This principle remains today.Public buildings were built with a variety of themes. Some (<b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House of Russia) made direct connections to earlier 1950s architecture, with a white marble-faced exterior and large bas-reliefs on the wings.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the turn}} of the millennium, bubblegum pop groups like Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears were {{dominating}} the charts, many of them with a Latin beat (Shakira, Ricky Martin), and rappers like Jay-Z and Eminem were huge stars. [...] Some garage rock revivalists <b>like</b> <b>The</b> <b>White</b> Stripes and The Hives became highly hyped bands in the indie rock field, and achieved substantial mainstream success. [...] The first few years of the 2000s saw the further rise of pop-hip hop, fed by the breakthrough success of Eminem. [...] Indeed, hip hop became an essential element of nearly all popular music during this period, resulting in new fusions like nu metal. [...] Pop thug rappers like Ja Rule were nationally renowned, though hard-edged hip made a return within a few years with the rise of 50 Cent. Politically minded hip hop in the tradition of Public Enemy and Boogie Down Productions has also diversified since the early 1990s with groups like The Coup, Sweatshop Union, Mr. Lif, Paris, Immortal Technique and many others.|$|E
2500|$|In 1875, {{delegates from}} 11 bowling clubs in New York City and Brooklyn {{gathered}} {{to form the}} National Bowling Association (NBA) and adopt a set of standard playing rules. While they agreed on a uniform distance of 60 feet from foul line to head pin {{and the size of}} the bowling ball, there were many other disagreements, including scoring, that caused splinter groups to form. It wasn't until 1895, when prominent bowling leaders gathered in New York City to form the American Bowling Congress (ABC), that the bulk of the standard rules for bowling that have survived to the modern day were drafted. The ABC was soon joined by similar organizations geared toward female bowlers, with the Women's International Bowling Congress (WIBC) being formed in 1916. (The ABC and WIBC jointly became the United States Bowling Congress [...] in 2005.) At the same time, the sport's image among the upper classes was enhanced by the opening of more luxurious and elegant alleys <b>like</b> <b>The</b> <b>White</b> Elephant in New York City, opened by restaurateur Joe Thum. Many consider Thum to be the father of modern bowling, along with inaugural ABC President Thomas Curtis and later, coming into the second half of the 20th century, American professional bowler Dick Weber.|$|E
