5|$|In {{his early}} career Whitehead wrote {{primarily}} on mathematics, <b>logic,</b> <b>and</b> physics. His most notable work in these fields is the three-volume Principia Mathematica (1910–13), {{which he wrote}} with former student Bertrand Russell.

40|$|Recently, {{a growing}} {{interest}} in description <b>logics</b> <b>and</b> their applications can be observed. This is mainly due {{to the development of}} very expressive description <b>logics</b> <b>and</b> optimized description <b>logic</b> systems which support terminological and/or assertional reasoning for these logics. This workshop intended to gather researchers as well as practitioners who are interested in description <b>logics</b> <b>and</b> their applications. The primary focus of this workshop was on applications of description logics. Ian Horrocks, University of Manchester, gives a tutorial-style talk about latest developments in description logic research...|$|R

5|$|Author {{of around}} 170 {{scientific}} articles and books, Steinhaus has left his legacy and contribution in many branches of mathematics, such as functional analysis, geometry, mathematical <b>logic,</b> <b>and</b> trigonometry.

40|$|Simple type {{theory is}} suited as {{framework}} for combining classical <b>and</b> non-classical <b>logics.</b> This claim {{is based on}} the observation that various prominent logics, including (quantified) multimodal <b>logics</b> <b>and</b> intuitionistic <b>logics,</b> can be elegantly embedded in simple type theory. Furthermore, simple type theory is sufficiently expressive to model combinations of embedded <b>logics</b> <b>and</b> it has a well understood semantics. Off-the-shelf reasoning systems for simple type theory exist that can be uniformly employed for reasoning within and about combinations of logics. Combinations of modal <b>logics</b> <b>and</b> other <b>logics</b> are particularly relevant for multi-agent systems...|$|R

5|$|Mieza {{was like}} a {{boarding}} school for Alexander {{and the children of}} Macedonian nobles, such as Ptolemy, Hephaistion, and Cassander. Many of these students would become his friends and future generals, and are often known as the 'Companions'. Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, <b>logic,</b> <b>and</b> art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works of Homer, and in particular the Iliad; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{classical}} <b>and</b> non-classical <b>logics</b> can be elegantly {{embedded in}} Church’s simple type theory, {{also known as}} classical higher-order logic. Examples include propositional <b>and</b> quantified multimodal <b>logics,</b> intuitionistic logics, <b>logics</b> for security, <b>and</b> <b>logics</b> for spatial reasoning. Furthermore, simple type theory is sufficiently expressive to model combinations of embedded <b>logics</b> <b>and</b> it has a well understood semantics. Off-the-shelf reasoning systems for simple type theory exist that can be uniformly employed for reasoning within <b>and</b> about embedded <b>logics</b> <b>and</b> <b>logics</b> combinations. In this article we focus on combinations of (quantified) epistemic <b>and</b> doxastic <b>logics</b> <b>and</b> study their application for modeling and automating the reasoning of rational agents. We present illustrating example problems and report on experiments with off-the-shelf higher-order automated theorem provers...|$|R

Among other stories compared to Spirited Away, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is seen to be more closely linked thematically.|$|E

One of its most important elements was a critique of his research methodology – of experimental <b>logic</b> <b>and</b> of variable analysis. Other writings of the period include Symbols of Class Status (1951) and On Cooling the Mark Out (1952). His doctoral dissertation, Communication Conduct in an Island Community (1953), presented a model of communication strategies in face-to-face interaction, and focused on how everyday life rituals affect public projections of self.|$|E

5|$|Many of Poe's conclusions, however, are {{speculative}} {{due to his}} {{rejection of}} analytic <b>logic</b> <b>and</b> emphasis on intuition and inspiration. Further, Eureka contains many scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions opposed Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets. He also says that Johannes Kepler came to his conclusions not through science but through guesswork. For this reason, {{it has been suggested}} that what Poe demands is true in Eureka is not actually about this universe, but a parallel fictitious one Poe creates. If this is the case, as interpreted by poet Richard Wilbur, Poe is criticizing this world, suggesting it has fallen away from God by elevating scientific reason above poetic intuition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Logic</b> <b>and</b> the {{philosophy}} of language are closely related. Philosophy of language {{has to do with}} the study of how our language engages and interacts with our thinking.
