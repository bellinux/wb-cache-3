40|$|The Manchester Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) was {{included}} {{as part of}} a questionnaire survey of 1989 drivers aged 50 or over. Previous research has differentiated three main types of aberrant driver behavior: errors, lapses and violations. Each of these has different psychological origins, and different implications for road safety interventions [Reason et al., 1990. Ergonomics 33, 1315 – 1312]. It has also been shown that, using a full age-range sample of drivers, reported violations were statistically associated with accident involvement, whereas errors and lapses were not [Parker et al., 1995 a. Ergonomics 38, 1036 – 1048; Parker et al., 1995 b. Accident Analysis and Prevention 27, 571 – 581]. Although factor analysis of the DBQ responses of this sample produced five factors, the original three-way distinction was preserved. However the pattern of relationships between factor scores and accident involvement was different. Relatively high scores on the error factor and the <b>lapse</b> <b>factor</b> were predictive of involvement in an active accident, while passive accident involvement was associated with high scores on the <b>lapse</b> <b>factor.</b> ...|$|E
30|$|One way {{in which}} a {{decrease}} in alertness manifests itself is via an increased rate of drivers’ lapses. However, drivers’ perception of importance of the attention lapse causal factor (Table  3) has no influence on their views on the effects of the physical environment on their state of alertness. None of the five related statement displayed any statistical significance in a Kruskall–Wallis H test with low (1 – 3), medium (4 – 7), and high (8 – 10) marks for the attention <b>lapse</b> <b>factor</b> as a categorical variable.|$|E
40|$|In {{the form}} of topic discussions, users {{interact}} with each other to share knowledge and exchange information in online fo-rums. Modeling the evolution of topic discussion reveals how information propagates on Internet and can thus help under-stand sociological phenomena and improve the performance of applications such as recommendation systems. In this pa-per, we argue that a user’s participation in topic discussions is motivated by either her friends or her own preferences. In-spired by the theory of information flow, we propose dynamic topic discussion models by mining influential relationships between users and individual preferences. Reply relations of users are exploited to construct the fundamental influential social network. The property of discussed topics and time <b>lapse</b> <b>factor</b> are also considered in our modeling. Further-more, we propose a novel measure called ParticipationRank to rank users according to how important they are in the so-cial network and to what extent they prefer to participate in the discussion of a certain topic. The experiments show our model can simulate the evolution of topic discussions well and predict the tendency of user’s participation accurately...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aims of {{this study}} included: Determination {{of the most common}} driver {{behavior}} in drivers and also analyzing the relationship between trait anxiety (TA) with subscale of driving behavior (lapses, errors, ordinary and aggressive violations). Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 168 drivers that having crash. The self-reporting of the drivers was determined by using Manchester driving behavior questionnaire (DBQ) and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results: Independent t-test showed that violations factor (ordinary and aggressive) are the most common behavior in drivers, Pearson correlation revealed that TA had a significant direct positive relation with all DBQ subscales especially error and <b>lapses</b> <b>factor</b> (P < 0. 01) also Pearson correlation showed that age had a negative significant relation with factors of DBQ. Conclusions: It can be concluded from the results (according to the relation between TA with error and <b>lapses</b> <b>factor)</b> that the rate of TA is destructive effective on the memory performance and process in the drivers and cause absent minded and memory imperfect function and process in these people during the driving...|$|R

40|$|Standard {{methods in}} {{non-linear}} analysis {{are used to}} indicate that there exists a parabolic branching of solutions of the Lichnerowicz-York equation with an unscaled source. We also apply these methods to the extended conformal thin sandwich formulation and, by assuming that the linearised system develops a kernel solution for sufficiently large initial data, we reproduce the parabolic solution curves for the conformal <b>factor,</b> <b>lapse</b> and shift found numerically by Pfeiffer and York. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{program of}} {{research}} was conducted to investigate factors influencing hazardous material (hazmat) vehicle crashes which are a significant road safety problem in Thailand and many other countries. The aims were to evaluate crash causes with regard to driver and organisational factors relating to hazmat truck crashes in Thailand. Three studies were conducted to address a series of research objectives and hypotheses. 340 hazmat drivers and 32 carrier companies participated in the studies. Study One focused on driver-related behavioural factors. The results indicated that four factors of aberrant driving behaviour (i. e. factor 1 highway-code violations, factor 2 speeding violations, factor 4 lapses, and factor 5 mistakes) were a predictor of crash involvement. However, driver compliance with Thai hazmat transport regulations and driver attitude towards safety regulations were not predictive of crashes. Study Two focused on organisational safety management factors. The {{results indicated that the}} implementation of safety management systems (SMSs) regarding communication was mostly supported by fleet managers. Also, safety management practices (SMPs) that encouraged a driver safety response, e. g. financial reinforcement were preferred by fleet managers. However, SMPs relating to the active role of companies, e. g. control of hours of service were still only sporadically adopted. Study Three was then performed to evaluate an aggregate effect of driver and organisational factors. The multilevel analysis of a two-level structure of these factors indicated that only an SMS component regarding control had a cross-level effect transmitting to driver crash outcome. Several SMS components and SMPs were also related to aberrant driving behavior. In summary, the studies suggest three possible pathways leading to an occurrence of hazmat truck crashes. (1) Driver attitude towards safety rules and regulations influenced driver behaviour regarding factor 1 highway-code violation. This factor, in turn, was significantly related to crash involvement. (2) Adoption of control of hours of service was related to factor 4 lapses while driving. The <b>lapse</b> <b>factor</b> was also predictive of crash involvement, and (3) Adoption of speed and route monitoring was related to factor 2 speeding violations. The speeding violation factor was found to be related to crash involvement. The findings are discussed and recommendations suggested in light of the particular work context and socio-cultural issues bearing on the hazmat transport industry in Thailand...|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{the goal}} for high {{accuracy}} modeling of gravitational radiation emitted by isolated systems, recently, there has been renewed interest in the numerical solution of the hyperboloidal initial value problem for Einstein's field equations in which the outer boundary of the numerical grid is placed at null infinity. In this article, we numerically implement the tetrad-based approach presented in [J. M. Bardeen, O. Sarbach, and L. T. Buchman, Phys. Rev. D 83, 104045 (2011) ] for a spherically symmetric, minimally coupled, self-gravitating scalar field. When this field is massless, the evolution system reduces to a regular, first-order symmetric hyperbolic system of equations for the conformally rescaled scalar field which is coupled {{to a set of}} singular elliptic constraints for the metric coefficients. We show how to solve this system based on a numerical finite-difference approximation, obtaining stable numerical evolutions for initial black hole configurations which are surrounded by a spherical shell of scalar field, part of which disperses to infinity and part of which is accreted by the black hole. As a non-trivial test, we study the tail decay of the scalar field along different curves, including one along the marginally trapped tube, one describing the world line of a timelike observer at a finite radius outside the horizon, and one corresponding to a generator of null infinity. Our results are in perfect agreement with the usual power-law decay discussed in previous work. This article also contains a detailed analysis for the asymptotic behavior and regularity of the <b>lapse,</b> conformal <b>factor,</b> extrinsic curvature and the Misner-Sharp mass function along constant mean curvature slices.

40|$|Adherence to a {{gluten-free}} diet is {{the mainstay}} of treatment for coeliac disease. Non-adherence is common as the diet is restrictive and {{can be difficult to}} follow. This study aimed to determine the rates of intentional and inadvertent non-adherence in adult coeliac disease and to examine the factors associated with both. A self-completion questionnaire was mailed to adult coeliac patients identified from the computer records of 31 family practices within the North East of England. We received 287 responses after one reminder. Intentional gluten consumption was reported by 115 (40 %) of respondents. 155 (54 %) had made at least one known mistaken lapse over the same period and 82 (29 %) reported neither intentional nor mistaken gluten consumption. Using logistic regression analysis, low self-efficacy, perceptions of tolerance to gluten and intention were found to be independently predictive of intentional gluten consumption. A statistical model predicted 71. 8 % of cases reporting intentional lapses. Intentional non-adherence to the GFD was found to be common but not as frequent as inadvertent <b>lapses.</b> Distinguishing the <b>factors</b> influencing both intentional and inadvertent non-adherence is useful in understanding dietary self-management in coeliac disease...|$|R
40|$|Background: Due {{to limited}} {{reporting}} of intervention rationale, {{little is known}} about what distinguishes a good intervention from a poor one. To support improved design, {{there is a need for}} comprehensive reports on novel and complex theory-based interventions. Specifically, the emerging trend of just-in-time tailoring of content in response to change in target behavior or emotional state is promising. Objective: The objective of this study was to give a systematic and comprehensive description of the treatment rationale of an online alcohol intervention called Balance. Methods: We used the intervention mapping protocol to describe the treatment rationale of Balance. The intervention targets at-risk drinking, and it is delivered by email, mobile phone text messaging, and tailored interactive webpages combining text, pictures, and prerecorded audio. Results: The rationale of the current treatment was derived from a self-regulation perspective, and the overarching idea was to support continued self-regulation throughout the behavior change process. Maintaining the change efforts over time and coping adaptively during critical moments (eg, immediately before and after a <b>lapse)</b> are key <b>factors</b> to successful behavior change. Important elements of the treatment rationale to achieving these elements were: (1) emotion regulation as an inoculation strategy against self-regulation failure, (2) avoiding lapses by adaptive coping, and (3) avoiding relapse by resuming the change effort...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the accuracy of}} a survey question {{about the number of}} times a subject has been arrested. Specifically, the study answers questions dealing with extent of response error, random versus systematic response errors, the reasons for response errors (lapses in memory and motivational factors that lead to under-reporting or overreporting), {{and the extent to which}} the survey response is an adequate substitute for actual data. The results demonstrate that there is a considerable amount of response error in the measure and that both memory <b>lapses</b> and motivational <b>factors</b> contribute to it. Some strategies for dealing with the problem are explored. Over the years, a great many studies have been conducted to assess the problem of measurement error in survey data (for an overview of the literature see Phillips, 1971; Deutscher, 1973; Bradburn and Sudman, 1974; Wyner, 1976). While the extent of error and the nature of the errors (random or systematic) depend upon the specific survey question being investigated, it is safe to say that response error is widespread. Survey estimates of means and relationships between variables may be substantially biased due to response errors, yet the magnitude of the bias is usually unexplored and therefore unknown. Attempts to overcome the problem have originated from two different directions. One approach, that of the survey researcher, has been to refine the interviewing process in the hope of reducing the amount of error in the data-collection phase of research. For example, the literature is replete with studies of the effects of th...|$|R
40|$|Aim : The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the driving {{behaviours}} of four ethnic groups and to investigate the relationship between violations, errors and lapses of DBQ and accident involvement in Qatar. Subjects and Methods: The Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) was used to measure the aberrant driving behaviours leading to accidents. Of 2400 drivers approached, 1824 drivers agreed to participate (76 %) and completed the driver behaviour questionnaire and background information. Results: The study revealed that the majority of the Qatari (35. 9 %) and Jordanian drivers (37. 5 %) were below 30 years of age, whereas Filipino (42. 3 %) and Indian subcontinent (34. 1 %) drivers were in the age group of 30 - 39 years. Qatari drivers (52 %) were involved in most accidents, followed by Jordanians (48. 3 %). The most common type of collision was a head on collision, which was similar in all four ethnic groups. The Qatari drivers scored higher on almost all items of violations, errors and lapses compared to other ethnic groups, while Filipino drivers were lower on all the items. The most common violation was the same in all four ethnic groups “Disregard the speed limits on a motorway”. The most common error item observed was “Queing to turn right/left on to a main road”. “Forget where you left your car” and “Hit something when reversing” were the two <b>lapses</b> identified in <b>factor</b> analysis. Conclusion: The present study identified that Qatari drivers scored higher on most of the items of violations, errors and lapses of DBQ compared to other countries, whereas Filipino drivers scored lower in DBQ items. </p...|$|R
