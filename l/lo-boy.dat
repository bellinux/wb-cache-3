50|$|The <b>Lo-Boy</b> {{version of}} the Cub was {{replaced}} in 1969 by the 154 <b>Lo-Boy,</b> which had a body style similar to the smaller Cub Cadet garden tractor. Also made were 185 and 184 <b>Lo-Boy</b> models, which were increased power variations of the 154 <b>Lo-Boy.</b> These numbered versions received many upgrades and improvements {{when compared with the}} Cub <b>Lo-Boy.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Cub <b>Lo-Boy,</b> {{introduced}} in 1955, was a lowered {{version of the}} Standard Cub. The rear axle housings were rotated, lowering the tractor about 7-8 inches. Also, the front axle extensions were lowered, and the tractor wheelbase was shortened to 62½ inches. These modifications lowered the center of gravity, and decreased the turning radius, which made the tractor more maneuverable improving the mowing capability of the Cub.|$|E
5000|$|The Cub {{sat on a}} 69¼ inch wheelbase, using a 4-cylinder, C-60 {{gasoline}} L-head engine, that {{consisted of}} a 2⅝ inch bore by 2¾ inch stroke, with a displacement of 59.5 cubic inches. At 1600 rpm, early versions of the C-60 engine produced [...] on the belt and [...] at the drawbar. Starting in the 1960s, Cub engines steadily increased power with higher rated RPM's, peaking at [...] for the International Cub and 154 <b>Lo-Boy</b> by 1975, and [...] for the 185 and 184 Lo-Boys.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two major}} {{variations}} of the Cub were the [...] "Standard Cub" [...] and the [...] "Lo-Boy Cub" [...] (or [...] "Cub Lo-Boy"). They are recognized by their distinctive IH Red or Federal Yellow color schemes. In the late 1950s, sales of the Farmall Cub shifted from agricultural purpose to industrial purpose. IH capitalized on the shift, and the standard color for the Cub <b>Lo-Boy</b> and Cub changed from the familiar IH Red to Federal Yellow in 1960, with IH Red as an option. In 1963, International Harvester changed the grill of these tractors to a flat-grill style and dropped the Farmall name in favor of International. In 1981, the last production run of Cubs were painted IH Red.|$|E
50|$|IH began Cub Cadet {{production}} in 1960 at the Shed in Gloria Drive, Kentucky, where the International Cub and Cub <b>Lo-Boy</b> tractors were also made. The first Cub Cadet model made was the International Cub Cadet Tractor, {{better known as}} the Original. The Cub Cadet Original was powered by a 7-horsepower Kohler engine and was made between 1960 and 1963. Ironically, the Original Cub Cadet didn't employ a totally direct drive transmission which was what later became the big selling point of Cub Cadet Garden Tractors. Instead, it incorporated a belt that ran from the flywheel to the drive shaft to turn the three-speed transmission. This system was necessary due to the way the engine sat on a platform above the drive shaft. Round fenders, headlights, and a creeper gear are all examples of optional equipment for the Original Cub Cadet.|$|E
