5|$|For {{almost a}} century {{only a few of}} the texts were published. In 1875, the {{director}} of the Chilean National Museum of Natural History in Santiago, Rudolf Philippi, published the Santiago Staff, and Carroll (1892) published part of the Oar. Most texts remained beyond the reach of would-be decipherers until 1958, when Thomas Barthel published <b>line</b> <b>drawings</b> of almost all the known corpus in his Grundlagen zur Entzifferung der Osterinselschrift ("Bases for the Decipherment of the Easter Island script") which remains the fundamental reference to rongorongo. He transcribed texts A through X, over 99% of the corpus; the CEIPP estimates that it is 97% accurate. Barthel's <b>line</b> <b>drawings</b> were not produced free-hand but copied from rubbings, which helped ensure their faithfulness to the originals.|$|E

40|$|Documentation of {{maritime}} {{heritage is}} essential for its protection, and for reference in restoration and renovation processes. These functions become problematic {{in the case of}} historical ships and boats that lack <b>lines</b> <b>drawings.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe a procedure for creation of <b>lines</b> <b>drawings</b> based on the shape analysis of surviving historical boats or their small-scale models with the help of reverse engineering (RE) techniques. The paper describes how digital photogrammetry and the iterative method were used to analyze the shape of three historical boats: Tomahawk, Refola and Nada. The application of the proposed procedure produced the <b>lines</b> <b>drawings</b> of the boats as its result. The accuracy of the 3 D CAD model obtained with the photogrammetric technique was verified by comparing it against a more accurate 3 D model produced with the help of a RE laser scanner. The examination of the resulting <b>lines</b> <b>drawings</b> proves that the digital photogrammetry process and the proposed iterative method are adequate tools for developing lines plans of boat models. The research offers the methodological basis for the creation of an archive of <b>lines</b> <b>drawings</b> of historical boats. Such an archive would provide reference for philologically correct restorations, and permit definition and classification of distinctive elements of various types of historical boats, particularly those produced in the Campania Region...|$|R

5|$|Symbols are visuals used to {{represent}} objects, actions, and concepts {{through the use of}} items such as the physical object itself, colored or black and white photographs, <b>line</b> <b>drawings,</b> and written words. For users with literacy skills, alphabet-based symbols including individual letters, whole words, or parts thereof may be used in combination with the other types of symbols.Tactile symbols which are textured objects, real objects or parts of real objects that are used as a communication symbols particularly for individuals with visual impairments and/or significant intellectual impairments. Both low- and high-tech devices can incorporate the use of symbols. With low-tech devices, a communication partner is involved and must interpret the symbols chosen. Picture Communication Exchange System (PECS) is a commonly used low-tech communication system that teach individuals how to request, comment, and answer questions through the use of <b>line</b> <b>drawings</b> known as picture communication symbols (PCS). , a high-tech communication system, is an app that incorporates various symbols and motor planning. Symbols are placed in fixed position on the screen which allow users to develop motor patterns associated with certain requests or statements. The choice of symbols and aspects of their presentation, such as size and background, depend on an individual's preferences as well as their linguistic, visual, and cognitive skills. This can be determined using an assessment for symbolic understanding.|$|E

5|$|Fox {{negotiated}} a deal which would prove extremely lucrative for Groening, {{in which he}} retained {{a large portion of}} revenue from merchandising. To animate the short segments, Brooks and company settled on Klasky Csupo, a small animation house who offered to produce the cartoons cheaply. Brooks initially just wanted to animate the shorts through the basic <b>line</b> <b>drawings,</b> and Klasky-Csupo offered color for the same cost. The studio only employed three young animators—CalArts graduates Bill Kopp, Wes Archer, and David Silverman—who adapted Groening's scripts for animation in one week, doing layouts, animation and inbetweening by hand in the very short amount of time. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the three, and assumed that the figures would be cleaned-up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes. Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the person who decided to make the characters yellow.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1978 with The Pickwick Papers, Keeping took on {{the mammoth}} task of {{illustrating}} the complete works of Charles Dickens for the Folio Society. His knowledge of the vanishing world of industrial London made him the perfect man for the job. The books were originally to be produced by letterpress printing, meaning the illustrations must be pure <b>line</b> <b>drawings</b> with no tones or washes. When they came to be published more modern printing techniques were used which would have allowed Keeping {{a full range of}} tones, but he had started with <b>line</b> <b>drawings,</b> so he used the same technique for the entire series, illustrating two books a year until he completed the task with Martin Chuzzlewit in 1988.|$|E

40|$|Normal {{subjects}} {{were presented with}} a simple line drawing of a face looking left, right, or straight ahead. A target letter F or T then appeared {{to the left or}} the right of the face. All subjects participated in target detection, localization, and identification response conditions. Although {{subjects were}} told that the <b>line</b> <b>drawing’s</b> gaze direction (the cue) did not predict where the target would occur, response time in all three conditions was reliably faster when gaze was toward versus away from the target. This study provides evidence for covert, reflexive orienting to peripheral locations in response to uninformative gaze shifts presented at fixation. The implications for theories of social attention and visual orienting are discussed, and the brain mechanisms that may underlie this phenomenon are considered. A moment’s introspection reveals that in everyday life, gaze shifts can provide a rich and complex source of social information. For instance, at a loud party one can communicate the desire to leave by simply “catching ” a friend’s eye and then looking toward the door. The use of gaze shift as a social cue would, of course, have had many evolutionary advantages as well. For example, a sudden shif...|$|R

40|$|Batavia, a Dutch East Indiaman, sank in 1629 on its {{maiden voyage}} to the Indies in the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago {{off the coast}} of Western Australia. The ship gained notoriety for the mutiny and horrific {{massacre}} that engulfed the survivors after the wreck, but the vessel itself was lost for centuries. The remains of the ship were discovered in 1963, and excavated between 1971 and 1980 by a team of archaeologists from the Western Australian Museum. The surviving hull timbers, raised from the seabed by archaeologists, represent approximately 3. 5 percent of the original hull. They include part of the transom and aft port quarter of the ship. To date, Batavia represents the only excavated remains of an early seventeenth?century Dutch East Indiaman that have been raised and conserved in a way that permits detailed study. This is of great significance as there are no <b>lines</b> <b>drawings</b> or construction plans for any Dutch ships from this period. The study and comparison of the Batavia hull timbers with those of other Dutch shipwrecks and historic documentation contributes to the understanding of Dutch shipbuilding techniques {{at the end of the}} sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth centuries...|$|R

40|$|<b>Lines</b> plan <b>drawings</b> {{play a very}} {{important}} role in the fields of naval architecture and ship design.

The survey process becomes very useful when dealing with ships or boats do not have proper <b>lines</b> plan <b>drawings</b> or in the absence of hull drawings. Various methods can be used to achieve the survey process such as laser and photogrammetry methods. Photogrammetry is used in case of inaccessibility or in which photogrammetry is the only possible way to be used. In this study, close range photogrammetry was used to survey the hull form of two boat models. The overall length of the first model is 0. 71 m, while the length of the other one is 2. 5 m. Commercial photogrammetry software was used for image processing to predict the lines of the two models. Moreover, the photogrammetry results of the large model have been exported into commercial naval architecture software to produce a fair hull surface model and to get the hydrostatic particulars for this model. Results obtained indicated that method developed was able to obtain good lines plans for the boat models...|$|R
