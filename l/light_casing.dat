5000|$|The Mark 10 was {{nicknamed the}} [...] "Airburst Elsie"; the Mark 8 had been nicknamed the LC or <b>Light</b> <b>Casing</b> bomb, {{which was then}} {{expanded}} to [...] "Elsie".|$|E
50|$|The {{relatively}} large screen, coupled with thin and <b>light</b> <b>casing,</b> allowed {{a balance of}} power and portability; especially given the quoted 3 hour battery life. This made the notebook especially popular with business users.|$|E
50|$|Groote Kaap (Great Cape) (also {{known as}} the Julianadorp Lighthouse) is a round steel {{lighthouse}} painted red with a white <b>light</b> <b>casing</b> on the North Sea coast in the dunes near Julianadorp by the sea, in the municipality of Den Helder. The construction of the tower was completed in 1966. The tower was replaced in 1985.|$|E
50|$|Introduces GEM-40 (Graphite-Epoxy Motor) solid {{boosters}} from Hercules (now Alliant). Besides being longer, their <b>lighter</b> <b>casings</b> allow higher payload capability.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: US Balao class [...] of WWII, {{showing the}} <b>lighter</b> colored <b>casing</b> atop the darker colored {{pressure}} hull. Note the many perforations {{running along the}} casing from bow to stern ...|$|R
25|$|Parabolic {{aluminized}} reflector (PAR) bulbs {{control light}} more precisely. They produce {{about four times}} the concentrated light intensity of general service (A), and are used in recessed and track <b>lighting.</b> Weatherproof <b>casings</b> are available for outdoor spot and flood fixtures.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reception}} of the S III has been particularly positive. Critics noted the phones blend of features, such as its S Voice application, display, processing speed, and dimensions as having an edge over its competition, the Apple iPhone 4S and HTC One X. Vlad Savov of The Verge declared it a [...] "technological triumph", while Natasha Lomas of CNET UK lauded the phones [...] "impossibly slim and <b>light</b> <b>casing</b> and a quad-core engine", calling it the [...] "Ferrari of Android phones", a sentiment affirmed ("a prince among Android phones") by Dave Oliver of Wired UK and ("king of Android") Esat Dedezade of Stuff magazine. Gareth Beavis of TechRadar noted that the S III is [...] "all about faster, smarter and being more minimal than ever before while keeping the spec list at the bleeding edge of technology." [...] Matt Warman of The Daily Telegraph said, [...] "On spending {{just a short time}} with the S3, Im confident in saying that its a worthy successor to the globally popular S2".|$|E
50|$|Problems {{associated}} with {{the design of the}} axial piston engine include high oil consumption, high fuel consumption, low rpm limit imposed by previously discussed frictional loads, low overall horsepower, mechanical complexity and complex machining methods needs to allow the engine {{to stand up to the}} loads imposed on the components. Additional problems are noted in that, the design does not have a long lifespan when compared to other engine designs due to large numbers of moving parts and relative high stresses. Wear and tear occurs at a faster rate because the engine makes more power pulses per turn of the cam than traditional engines. Lastly, due to very high initial torque and a need for large amounts of coolant, loss of oil or coolant to this design during running will almost certainly result in a catastrophic explosion of the engine because the engine generally has very <b>light</b> <b>casings</b> or shields located in the area around the cams and connecting rods.|$|R
5|$|The RAF {{activated}} 20 squadrons between September 1958 and December 1959 {{to operate}} the 120 Thor missiles. They were located at 20 old wartime airfields so that {{the government did not}} have to purchase the land. Each missile was supplied with its own Mark 49 warhead, a variant of the Mark 28 with a thinner and <b>lighter</b> <b>casing.</b> While the Thor missile bases were manned by the RAF, the warheads were supplied under Project E. Each one had a USAF authorisation officer. The missiles used a dual key system, one of which was held by the authorisation officer. Occasionally a missile would be chosen for test firing, for which the missile and its RAF crew would be flown to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Twelve test firings were conducted between 6 October 1959 and 12 June 1962. Under the original agreement, the USAF paid the cost of maintenance for the missiles for five years. After a debate over costs and benefits, the Air Council decided on 31 May 1962 that Project Emily should be terminated by the end of 1963. The last Thor squadrons were inactivated on 23 August 1963. The missiles were returned to the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Few wells {{actually}} produce through casing, since producing fluids can corrode {{steel or}} form deposits such as asphaltenes or paraffin waxes {{and the larger}} diameter can make flow unstable. Production tubing is therefore installed inside the last casing string and the tubing annulus is usually sealed {{at the bottom of}} the tubing by a packer. Tubing is easier to remove for maintenance, replacement, or for various types of workover operations. It is significantly <b>lighter</b> than <b>casing</b> and does not require a drilling rig to run in and out of hole; smaller [...] "service rigs" [...] are used for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|The end of {{the tube}} which {{projects}} into the tank is furnished with a bell-mouthed casting of gunmetal, and to this is attached a <b>light</b> cylindrical <b>casing</b> of sheet iron, within which the torpedo to be fired is placed, {{the inside of the}} casing being furnished with ribs, upon which the torpedo rests. Each torpedo is furnished at its rear end with a knob, or button-shaped projection, and, when a torpedo is placed in the casing just mentioned, this knob is clipped by fingers carried {{at the end of a}} tubular rod, which slides through the main tube already described; and by this means the torpedo is held in place in the casing until fired.|$|R
5000|$|In some European countries, {{cooked and}} often smoked wiener {{sausages}} bought fresh from supermarkets, delicatessens and butcher shops {{may be called}} by a name (such as in German or French) which translates in English as [...] "Vienna sausage." [...] Traditionally, they are made from spiced ham. Wieners sold as Vienna sausage in Europe have a taste and texture very much like North American [...] "hot dogs" [...] or [...] "frankfurters", but are usually longer and somewhat thinner, with a very <b>light,</b> edible <b>casing.</b> European Vienna sausage served hot in a long bun with condiments is often called a [...] "hot dog", referring not to the wiener itself, but to the long sandwich as a whole.|$|R
25|$|The major {{components}} of an ERS <b>light</b> are the <b>casing</b> {{in which the}} internal parts are mounted, an ellipsoidal reflector located {{in the back of}} the casing, a lamp mounted to position the filament at the rear focal point of the ellipsoid, a dual plano-convex lens (two plano-convex lenses facing each other in the barrel), and at the front, a gel frame to hold the color gel. The light from the lamp is efficiently gathered by the ellipsoidal reflector and sent forward through the gate, shutters and lens system.|$|R
5000|$|The GEM-40 is a 40 in SRM used on Delta II {{beginning}} in 1990. The use of composite materials allowed for booster <b>casings</b> <b>lighter</b> than the steel casings of the Castor 4 SRMs they replaced. The first flight of a GEM-40 occurred in 1990 on a Delta II 7925. Delta II vehicles can use three, four, or nine GEM-40s. When using {{three or four}} boosters, all GEM-40s ignite on the ground, while on Delta IIs using nine boosters six are ignited on the ground, and the remaining three are ignited in the air when the first six burn out.|$|R
50|$|The 2010 Hypermotard 1100 {{bikes are}} both {{considerably}} lighter than before, mainly {{due to the}} vacuum-cast engine <b>casings,</b> <b>lighter</b> crankshaft, flywheel and alternator, but the rear subframe has also been redesigned and both bikes carry some carbon fibre. The Evo SP gets the full complement of carbon fibre, as the 'S' model before it, but a rear hugger is now standard on the SP. The Evo model weighs 172 kg (379 lbs) versus 171 kg (377 lbs) for the Evo SP, the latter's cast alloy wheels making the difference. The Evo has Pirelli Diablo Rosso tyres and the Evo SP has Pirelli Diablo Supercorsa SP. As with last year's more expensive model, the SP comes with Ducati's DDA device/ software.|$|R
5000|$|The G Flex's {{physical}} design {{resembles that}} of the LG G2, consisting of a polycarbonate shell with a curvature of 700 millimetres (28 in), with volume and power buttons located on {{the rear of the}} device directly below the camera—the power button also contains an LED lamp which {{can be used as a}} notification <b>light.</b> The rear <b>casing</b> of the G Flex carries a [...] "brushed metal" [...] look and features a [...] "self-healing" [...] coating which can repair minor scratches and abrasions made to it. LG claimed that the curved design would be more [...] "natural" [...] when held to the head for conducting phone calls, and would reduce the level of glare on the display. While the phone can withstand being bent—having been being bent a hundred times with 88 pounds (40 kg) of pressure during internal testing without any permanent damage to its form, LG chose to maintain a level of rigidity to the G Flex's design in order to ensure a [...] "premium" [...] feel. The G Flex's internal hardware is almost identical to the G2, with a 2.26 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor with 2 GB of RAM, support for LTE or LTE Advanced networks where available, 32 GB of internal storage, and an infrared emitter. Unlike the G2, however, the G Flex's display is a 6-inch (15 cm), 720p, flexible OLED display coated with Gorilla Glass, and it also incorporates a non-removable 3500 mAh battery specifically optimized for the G Flex's curved form factor.|$|R
50|$|The early {{cars were}} very popular and earned some rave reviews; one {{magazine}} described {{the car as}} a tin-top version of a Lotus 7. It was 'THE car' for many enthusiasts who before {{had to settle for}} a Cortina GT or a Mini-Cooper and it also amazed a lot of the public who were used to overweight 'sports cars' like the Austin-Healey 3000. The launch was not perfect however, the car was too specialist for some Ford dealerships who did not understand the car; there are a few stories of incorrect parts being fitted at services. There were a few teething problems reported by the first batch of owners, (most of these problems show how quickly the car was developed) some of the engines were down on power, the gear ratios were too close and the worst problem was the differential housing coming away from the casing. This problem was mainly caused by the high loads put on the axle because of the A bracket it {{was an integral part of}} the rear suspension. This was made even worse by the fact any oil lost from the axle worked its way on to the bushes of the A bracket. There were 4 main updates made to the Mk1 Lotus during its production to solve some of these problems. The first change was a swap to a two-piece prop shaft and the <b>lighter</b> alloy transmission <b>casing</b> were changed for standard Ford items; this also included swapping the ultra close ratio gears for Cortina GT gear ratios, the main difference was 1st, 2nd and reverse were much higher ratios. from 1964, standard panels were used rather than the light alloy ones. Alloy items and ultra-close ratios coulds be specified when buying new cars.|$|R
