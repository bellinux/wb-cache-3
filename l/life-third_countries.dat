The report describes the late dry-season terrestrial environment within an area that follows {{the boundaries of the}} proposed Qawra/Dwejra Heritage Park and evaluates the ecological and conservation significance of the biotic assemblages present within this area. The present study is being carried out {{in the context of the}} Dwejra LIFE project, awarded to Nature Trust (Malta) under the <b>LIFE-Third</b> <b>Countries</b> component of the European Union’s LIFE programme (Commission Reference: LIFE 03 TCY/MT/ 000047). The Project was awarded to Nature Trust (Malta) in 2003 and runs from 1 st April 2004 to 31 st March 2007. Project partners include the Malta Environment and Planning Authority and Associazione Italiana per il WWF. The general aims of the project are as follows: Development of a restoration / conservation and management plan. Establishment of a framework for environmental management. Strengthening of current administrative and enforcement capacities. Implementation of environmental education programmes through the creation of an eco-tourism and environmental education site. Use of the project as a demonstration for the creation of further coastal nature reserves. Creation of a Coastal Nature Reserve which conforms with the objectives of the Coastal Zone Management Subject Plan, as well as the Structure Plan for Malta and Gozo. peer-reviewe...|$|E
