5|$|Wind {{turbines}} reached {{grid parity}} (the {{point at which}} the cost of wind power matches traditional sources) in some areas of Europe in the mid-2000s, and in the US around the same time. Falling prices continue to drive the <b>levelized</b> <b>cost</b> down and {{it has been suggested that}} it has reached general grid parity in Europe in 2010, and will reach the same point in the US around 2016 due to an expected reduction in capital costs of about 12%.|$|E
5|$|Grid parity, {{the point}} at which the cost of {{photovoltaic}} electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of grid power, is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in California and Japan. In 2008, The <b>levelized</b> <b>cost</b> of electricity for solar PV was $0.25/kWh or less in most of the OECD countries. By late 2011, the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the OECD and to reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of power purchase agreements (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, grid operators and wind turbine manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|The <b>levelized</b> <b>cost</b> of {{electricity}} (LCoE) {{can be calculated}} by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by the total amount {{of electricity}} shipped to the grid during that period. The amount of money is essentially a combination of the capital expense (CAPEX) of the plant and the interest payments on that CAPEX, and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted operational expenses, or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated by considering the peak power the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the capacity factor (CF) to account for downtime due to maintenance or deliberate throttling. As a quick calculation, one can ignore inflation, opportunity costs and minor operational expenses to develop a figure of merit for the cost of electricity.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the economically achievable potential for improving electricity end-use efficiency in the U. S. The approach involves identifying {{a series of}} energy-efficiency policies aimed at tackling market failures, and then examining their impacts and cost-effectiveness using Georgia Tech’s version of the National Energy Modeling System (GT-NEMS). By estimating the policy-driven electricity savings and the associated <b>levelized</b> <b>costs,</b> a policy supply curve for electricity efficiency is produced. Each policy is evaluated individually and in an Integrated Policy scenario to examine policy dynamics. The Integrated Policy scenario demonstrates significant achievable potential: 261 TWh (6. 5 %) of electricity savings in 2020, and 457 TWh (10. 2 %) in 2035. All eleven policies examined were estimated to have lower <b>levelized</b> <b>costs</b> than average electricity retail prices. <b>Levelized</b> <b>costs</b> range from 0. 5 – 8. 0 cent/kWh, with the regulatory and information policies tending to be most cost-effective. Policy impacts on the power sector, carbon dioxide emissions, and energy intensity are also estimated to be significant. *Corresponding author...|$|R
50|$|The US Energy Information Administration has {{recommended}} that <b>levelized</b> <b>costs</b> of non-dispatchable {{sources such as}} wind or solar may be better compared to the avoided energy cost {{rather than to the}} LCOE of dispatchable sources such as fossil fuels or geothermal. This is because introduction of fluctuating power sources may or may not avoid capital and maintenance costs of backup dispatchable sources. <b>Levelized</b> Avoided <b>Cost</b> of Energy (LACE) is the avoided costs from other sources divided by the annual yearly output of the non-dispatchable source. However, the avoided cost is much harder to calculate accurately.|$|R

25|$|A {{key issue}} in {{implementing}} IGCC is its high capital cost, which prevents it from competing with other power plant technologies. Currently, ordinary pulverized coal plants are the lowest cost power plant option. The advantage of IGCC {{comes from the}} ease of retrofitting existing power plants that could offset the high capital cost. In a 2007 model, IGCC with CCS is the lowest-cost system in all cases. This model compared estimations of <b>levelized</b> <b>cost</b> of electricity, showing IGCC with CCS to cost 71.9 $US2005/MWh, pulverized coal with CCS to cost 88 $US2005/MWh, and natural gas combined cycle with CCS to cost 80.6 $US2005/MWh. The <b>levelized</b> <b>cost</b> of electricity was noticeably sensitive {{to the price of}} natural gas and the inclusion of carbon storage and transport costs.|$|E
25|$|The <b>levelized</b> <b>cost</b> is {{that value}} for which an equal-valued fixed revenue {{delivered}} {{over the life}} of the asset's generating profile would cause the project to break even.

50|$|For instance, {{wind power}} {{connects to the}} grid on the {{distribution}} side (as opposed to the customer side). This means it competes with other large forms of industrial-scale power like hydro, nuclear or coal-fired plants, which are generally inexpensive forms of power. Additionally, the generator will be charged by the distribution operator to carry the power to the markets, adding to their <b>levelized</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Predicted by Swanson's law, the <b>levelized</b> <b>costs</b> for {{photovoltaics}} have {{plunged to}} levels just above that of hydropower and wind power.

25|$|Estimates {{of total}} costs range from 7 (for a 200 MW plant) and 21 (for a 5 MW plant) euro cents per kWh to 25–35 cents per kWh. <b>Levelized</b> <b>cost</b> are {{approximately}} 3 Euro cents per KWh for a 100 MW wind or natural gas plant.

25|$|Despite these complexities, most of {{the data}} {{indicate}} that wind energy {{is one of the}} most cost efficient sources of renewable energy but approximately two times the cost of coal generated power in 2006. When the costs associated with pollution are factored in it was competitive with coal- and gas-fired power stations even then. By 2014, wind had the lowest <b>levelized</b> <b>cost</b> of energy (LCOE) of any power source in Australia.|$|E
25|$|While {{the cost}} of {{constructing}} established nuclear power reactor designs has followed an increasing trend due to regulations and court cases whereas the <b>levelized</b> <b>cost</b> of electricity is declining for wind power. In 2010 a report from Solar researchers at Duke University suggested that solar power became cheaper than nuclear power, anti-nuclear organizations promote this worldview. However the duo state that if subsidies were removed for solar power, the crossover point would be delayed by years.|$|E
40|$|One {{possible}} way to further reduce <b>levelized</b> <b>costs</b> of electricity of {{concentrated solar thermal}} energy is to directly use water/steam as the primary heat transfer fluid within a concentrated collector field. This socalled direct steam generation offers the opportunity of higher operating temperatures and better exergy efficiency. A technical challenge of the direct steam generation technology compared to oil-driven power cycles is a competitive storage technology for heat transfer fluids with a phase change. Latent heat thermal energy storages are suitable for storing heat at a constant temperature {{and can be used}} for direct steam generation power plants. The calculation of the economic impact of an economically optimized thermal energy storage system, based on a latent heat thermal energy storage system with phase change material, is the main focus of the presented work. To reach that goal, a thermal energy storage system for a direct steam generation power plant with parabolic troughs in the solar field was thermally designed to determine the boundary conditions. This paper discusses the economic impact of the designed thermal energy storage system based on the <b>levelized</b> <b>costs</b> of electricity results, provided via a wide parametric study. A state-of-the-art power cycle with a primary and a secondary heat transfer fluid and a two-tank thermal energy storage is used as a benchmark technology for electricity generation with solar thermal energy. The benchmark and direct steam generation systems are compared to each other, based respectively on their annual electricity yields and their <b>levelized</b> <b>costs</b> of electricity at two different sites. A brief comparison of a passive and an active latent heat storage system is included. Finally, specific target costs for the new direct steam generation thermal energy storage system are determined {{based on the results of}} the parametric study...|$|R

To date, almost all have been supported at least in part by regulatory incentives such as feed-in tariffs or tax credits, but as <b>levelized</b> <b>costs</b> have fallen significantly in the last decade and grid parity has been reached in an increasing number of markets, it may not be long before external incentives cease to exist.|$|R
25|$|Grid parity (or socket parity) {{occurs when}} an {{alternative}} energy source can generate electricity at a <b>levelized</b> <b>cost</b> (LCoE) that is {{less than or equal}} to the price of purchasing power from the electricity grid. Reaching grid parity is considered to be the point at which an energy source becomes a contender for widespread development without subsidies or government support. It is widely believed that a wholesale shift in generation to these forms of energy will take place when they reach grid parity.|$|E

40|$|Atmospheric {{fluidized-bed}} combustion (AFBC) is {{the prevalent}} technology in boiler design for new power plants.

We find important relationships between the type of fuel used and unit-output fuel costs (AFBC plants burning scrap are cheaper in fuel per unit of output, despite the lower heat content of scrap) and between operating costs and plant size (larger AFBC plants are cheaper to run). While we find that the advantage in unit fuel costs is not reflected in <b>levelized</b> total <b>costs</b> (which are affected only by plant size), this result may be caused by our procedure for calculating <b>levelized</b> total <b>costs</b> from component costs. ...|$|R

500|$|The PV {{industry}} {{is beginning to}} adopt <b>levelized</b> <b>cost</b> of electricity (LCOE) as the unit of cost. The electrical energy generated is sold in units of kilowatt-hours (kWh). As a rule of thumb, and depending on the local insolation, 1 watt-peak of installed solar PV capacity generates about 1 to 2kWh of electricity per year. This corresponds to a capacity factor of around 10–20%. The product of the local cost of electricity and the insolation determines the break even point for solar power. The International Conference on Solar Photovoltaic Investments, organized by EPIA, has estimated that PV systems will pay back their investors in 8 to 12 years. [...] As a result, since 2006 it has been economical for investors to install photovoltaics for free {{in return for a}} long term power purchase agreement.

As of 2013, the US Energy Information Administration estimates the [...] "levelized cost" [...] of wind energy from new installations as 7 to 10 cents per kWh, depending on the geographic area, but cautioned that levelized costs of non-dispatchable sources such as wind should {{be compared to the}} avoided energy cost rather than the <b>levelized</b> <b>cost</b> of dispatchable sources such as natural gas, or baseload sources such as coal or geothermal.

Renewable portfolio standards require renewable energy to exist (most of them intermittent such as wind and solar), but at the expense of utilities and consumers. The production tax credit makes wind power cheaper for utilities and consumers, but at the expense of taxpayers.

40|$|Hydrogen {{infrastructure}} costs will vary by region as geographic characteristics and feedstocks differ. This paper proposes {{a method for}} optimizing regional hydrogen infrastructure deployment by combining detailed spatial data in a geographic information system (GIS) with a technoeconomic model of hydrogen infrastructure components. The method is applied to {{a case study in}} Ohio in which coal-based hydrogen infrastructure with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is modeled for two distribution modes at several steady-state hydrogen vehicle market penetration levels. The paper identifies the optimal infrastructure design at each market penetration as well as the costs, CO 2 emissions, and energy use associated with each infrastructure pathway. The results indicate that aggregating infrastructure at the regional-scale yields lower <b>levelized</b> <b>costs</b> of hydrogen than at the city-level at a given market penetration level, and centralized production with pipeline distribution is the favored pathway even at low market penetration.

40|$|In this study, a new {{cost model}} is {{developed}} for CO 2 pipeline transport, which {{starts with the}} physical properties of CO 2 transport and includes different kinds of steel grades and up-to-date material and construction costs. This pipeline cost model is used for a new developed tool to determine the configuration leading to the lowest <b>levelized</b> <b>costs</b> for CO 2 transport, for point-to-point pipelines {{as well as for}} simple networks on different types of terrain and for different time frames. The model optimizes inlet pressure, diameter, steel grade and number of pumping stations. Results show that gaseous CO 2 transport can give lower <b>levelized</b> <b>costs</b> than liquid CO 2 transport for point-to-point pipelines and for simple networks, if the CO 2 is stored in a reservoir with a low required injection pressure, like depleted natural gas fields. However, for storage fields with a required injection pressure of 8 MPa or higher (like aquifers), CO 2 can be better transported in a liquid form. For onshore pipelines transporting liquid CO 2, the optimal inlet pressure is 9 - 13 MPa and pumping stations are installed roughly every 50 - 100 km. For offshore pipelines, pumping stations are not an option and the inlet pressure is determined by the length of the pipeline. The maximum inlet pressure is about 25 MPa and for even longer pipelines, a larger diameter is selected. The <b>levelized</b> <b>costs</b> (excluding initial compression) for transporting 100 kg/s (about 3 Mt/y) over 100 km are between 1. 8 and 33 (sic) /t for liquid and 4. 0 - 6. 4 (sic) /t for gaseous CO 2 transport. For larger mass flows the costs are decreasing, for instance transporting 200 kg/s (about 6 Mt/y) over 100 km are 1. 2 - 1. 8 (sic) /t for liquid and 3. 0 - 3. 8 (sic) /t for gaseous CO 2 transport. Furthermore, results show that higher steel grades lead to lower investment costs for onshore pipelines transporting liquid CO 2. Using X 120 in the long term reduces the pipeline costs up to 17 %. For gaseous CO 2 transport, lower steel grades (like X 42 and X 52) are the best option. Also offshore pipelines do not benefit from the development of higher steel grades over time because the thickness should be at least 2. 5 % of the outer diameter. The results indicate that oversizing the pipeline, to transport CO 2 from an additional source that is coming available later, is not always cost-attractive. This strongly depends on the time span of which further CO 2 sources are available and on the mass flows. Oversizing appears earlier cost-attractive compared to two point-to-point pipelines if the source with the largest mass flow becomes available first. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
