40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} is intended to determine the accuracy of various <b>limit</b> <b>dose</b> tests. A <b>limit</b> <b>dose</b> test involves dosing a number of animals with a chemical at a single dose, the <b>limit</b> <b>dose.</b> All animals may be dosed at once or animals may be dosed one or two at a time. The test outcome {{is a series of}} deaths and survivals. A set of rules associates a test outcome with a decision as to whether the median lethal dose or LD 50 is above or below the <b>limit</b> <b>dose.</b> An example of a decision rule would be to classify the LD 50 as over the <b>limit</b> <b>dose</b> when more than half the animals die. The {{analysis in}} this paper uses a computer model to evaluate the accuracy of these decision rules. A decision rule is defined to be correct when the LD 50 is correctly classified as above or below the <b>limit</b> <b>dose.</b> This classification is probabilistic because it depends on the deaths and survivals observed in the <b>limit</b> <b>dose</b> test. In assessing the test accuracy, the model begins by assuming the existence of a probit dose-response curve with a known LD 50 and slope. This curve is used to estimate the probability that an animal will die or survive at a given dose. The computer model then extends this result to the number of animals tested by calculating the probability of each possible sequenc...|$|E

Gla proteins are important for normal blood coagulation and normality of bones and arteries. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the potential toxicity of synthetic MK- 7 in BomTac:NMRI mice and in Sprague-Dawley rats. In an acute oral toxicity test, mice were administered a single oral dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight (<b>limit</b> <b>dose)</b> and no toxicity was observed during the 14 -day observation period. In the subchronic oral toxicity test in rats, animals were administered MK- 7 for 90 days by gavage at the following doses: 0 (vehicle control, corn oil), 2. 5, 5, and 10 mg/kg body weight/day. All generated data, including clinical observations, ophthalmology, clinical pathology, gross necropsy, and histopathology, revealed no compound-related toxicity in rats. Any statistically significant findings in clinical pathology parameters and/or organ weights noted were considered to be within normal biological variability. Therefore, under the conditions of this experiment, the median lethal dose (LD 50) of MK- 7 after a single oral administration in mice was determined to be greater than the <b>limit</b> <b>dose</b> level of 2000 mg/kg body weight.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine the preliminary oral toxicity profile of the aqueous extract of bark of Helicteres isora L.

The acute oral toxicity study was conducted using <b>limit</b> <b>dose</b> test of up and down procedure according to the OECD/OCDE Test Guidelines on Acute Oral Toxicity (AOT 425 statPgm, version: 1. 0) at a <b>limit</b> <b>dose</b> of 2000 mg/kg/p. o. Repeat dose oral toxicity studies were conducted by daily oral dosing of 500 mg kg - 1 b. w of HIL dissolved in 1 mL of 0. 9 % saline and 1 mL of 0. 9 % saline to rats in the test and control groups, respectively, for 28 days. On day 29, blood samples for bioassays were collected by cardiac puncture under chloroform anesthesia. The phytochemical analysis was conducted using standard procedures. The LD 50 estimate of the extract was calculated to be greater than 2000 mg/kg/p. o. The extract caused a significant (p< 0. 05) decrease in weight gain, differential eosinophil count and increase in serum creatinine but did not affect the organ weights, other serum electrolytes (Na +, K +, HCO 3), liver enzymes and other hematological indices in test rats. Its phytochemical analysis showed it contains saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, phlobatannins, glycosides, reducing sugars and anthraquinones. These results show that the aqueous extract of Helicteres isora is relatively safe toxicologically when administered orally. Thus, its use in folkloric medicine as an oral antidiabetic is relatively safe when used over the tested period...|$|E

40|$|Combined {{administration}} of IgA and IgG anti-Thy- 1 antibodies enhances renal inflammation in rats. BackgroundIgA nephropathy (IgAN) {{is the most}} common type of immunologically mediated glomerulonephritis (GN) and is characterized by deposition in the glomerular mesangium of IgA together with C 3, C 5 b- 9, and properdin. In patients, the codeposition of IgA together with IgG and/or IgM can lead to a more progressive course of disease. In Wistar rats, mesangial proliferative GN can be induced by the injection of mouse IgG anti-Thy- 1 antibodies (ER 4 G). In contrast, the {{administration of}} mouse IgA anti-Thy- 1 antibodies (ER 4 A) to rats results in isolated hematuria without detectable albuminuria and without detectable complement deposition. MethodsTo investigate the effect of the combination of IgA and IgG on glomerular injury, Wistar rats were injected with a <b>limiting</b> <b>dose</b> of ER 4 G in the presence or absence of ER 4 A in a dose able to induce hematuria. ResultsAlthough the <b>limiting</b> <b>dose</b> of ER 4 G or the dose of ER 4 A used did not induce significant albuminuria, the combination of ER 4 G and ER 4 A resulted in a synergistic increase in albuminuria. Microhematuria occurred in rats receiving either ER 4 A or ER 4 G alone or in combination. Although both ER 4 A or a <b>limiting</b> <b>dose</b> of ER 4 G induced minor increases in extracellular matrix expansion, the combination resulted in a pronounced, additive increased matrix expansion. ConclusionWe conclude that in this model of IgA-mediated glomerulopathy, a selective complement-dependent synergistic renal injury is induced in Wistar rats by glomerular codeposition of mouse anti-Thy- 1 monoclonal isotypes...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess, through contouring the single dental cavities, the absorbed radiation dose on irradiated alveolar bones during the treatment of cervico-facial tumours, so as to test the correlation between the absorbed dose of radiation at alveolar level and the level of individual surgical risk for osteonecrosis. Materials andmethods: we selected 45 out of 89 patients on the basis of different exclusion criteria. Nine of these patients showed evidence of osteoradionecrosis. The patients were treated either with 3 D conformational radiation therapy (3 D-CRT) or with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), there after alveolar bones were contoured using computed axial tomography (CAT scans) carried out following oncological and dental treatment. The dose-volume histograms (DVH) were obtained on the basis of such data, which included those relating to the dental cavities in addition to those inherent to the tumours and the organs at risk. Results: all patients, irrespective of type of treatment, received an average of 60 to 70 grays in 30 / 35 sittings. The patients treated with IMRT showed higher variation in absorbed radiation dose than those treated with 3 D-CRT. The alveolar encirclement allowed {{the assessment}} of the absorbed radiation dose, and consequently it also allowed to assess the individual surgical risk for osteonecrosis in patients with head and neck tumours who underwent radiography treatment.

Toxicity signs like a convulsion, abnormal posture, paralysis followed by abnormal necropsy findings on the brain may be pointing to targeted brain toxicity.

The ocu-lar findings following prenatal TCE exposure are reported in stud-ies that were not designed specifically for developmental safety as-sessment, and thus did not use standard experimental practices.
