5|$|Between 1849 and 1870, five <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> {{buildings}} were erected by George Müller {{to care for}} 2,050 orphans in his Ashley Down orphanage.|$|E
5|$|Property {{changes since}} the {{original}} construction include the front terrace, entranceway and landscaping. The former front lawn and flower beds were paved over, {{and a new}} driveway was cut into the stone wall north of the original <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> arch over the first driveway.|$|E
5|$|A <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> {{windmill}} {{was built}} on a hill by late 1686, doubling as a watch tower over the Ottawa River, the Lake of Two Mountains and {{the mouth of the}} Des Prairies River. This windmill was like no other in New France (although a similar fortified windmill was later built in Quebec), with thick walls, square loopholes for muskets, with machicolation at the top for pouring lethally hot liquids and rocks onto attackers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>largest</b> <b>stone</b> {{circle in}} Britain is at Avebury, the second <b>largest</b> <b>stone</b> circle is the Great Circle at Stanton Drew stone circles, and the Ring of Brodgar {{contains}} the third <b>largest</b> <b>stone</b> circle in Britain.|$|R
50|$|In {{periglacial}} {{areas and}} areas affected by seasonal frost, repeated freezing and thawing of groundwater forces <b>larger</b> <b>stones</b> toward the surface, as smaller stones flow and settle underneath <b>larger</b> <b>stones.</b> At the surface, {{areas that are}} rich in <b>larger</b> <b>stones</b> contain much less water than highly porous areas of finer grained sediments. These water-saturated areas of finer sediments have a much greater ability to expand and contract as freezing and thawing occur, leading to lateral forces which ultimately pile <b>larger</b> <b>stones</b> into clusters and stripes. Through time, repeated freeze-thaw cycles smooth out irregularities and odd-shaped piles to form the common polygons, circles, and stripes of patterned ground.|$|R
5000|$|Megalithic art {{refers to}} the use of <b>large</b> <b>stones</b> as an artistic medium. Although some modern artists and sculptors make use of <b>large</b> <b>stones</b> in their work, the term is more {{generally}} used to describe art carved onto megaliths in prehistoric Europe.|$|R
5|$|A second range stood {{along the}} north-west wall, {{and would have}} been {{connected}} to the hall range by the donjon tower. The ground floor housed a kitchen. In 1725 the range was remodelled into a two-storey house, accessed via a stone stair, and topped with the dormer windows which now form part of the gatehouse. The well in front is original, although the <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> surround is of 19th century date.|$|E
5|$|During the Bronze Age fewer <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> {{structures}} were built although the great ceremonial circles continued in use as metalworking was slowly introduced to Britain from Europe over a lengthy period. There are relatively few Orcadian sites dating from this era {{although there is}} the impressive Plumcake Mound near the Ring of Brodgar and various islands sites such as Tofts Ness on Sanday {{and the remains of}} two houses on Holm of Faray.|$|E
5|$|Fort Senneville {{is one of}} the {{outlying}} forts of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, built by the Canadiens of New France near the Sainte-Anne rapids in 1671. The property was part of a fief ceded to Dugué de Boisbriant in 1672 by the Sulpicians. A <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> windmill, which doubled as a watch tower, was built on a hill by late 1686 and featuring machicolation and other castle-like features. The fort was burned down by Iroquois in 1691, with only the mill itself left standing.|$|E

5|$|In 1861, a stone {{addition}} to the original 1774 Georgian structure was built. The <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> blocks used {{for the construction of}} the addition were quarried from the plantation's Mill Creek Mountain, a ridge located across the South Branch Potomac River {{to the west of the}} mansion. The stone blocks were hewed by sawyers, then transported across the river to the mansion, and lifted upon the addition's scaffolding with wheelbarrows. A Mr. Ferrybe supervised and managed the stone addition's construction.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, Joseph of Arimathea, with Pilate's {{permission}} and with Nicodemus' help, removes Jesus' {{body from the}} cross, wraps him in a clean cloth, and buries him in his new rock-hewn tomb. In , {{on the following day}} the chief Jewish priests ask Pilate for the tomb to be secured, and with Pilate's permission the priests place seals on the <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> covering the entrance.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of ancient Egypt includes {{some of the}} most famous structures in the world: the Great Pyramids of Giza and the temples at Thebes. Building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes, but also to reinforce the wide-ranging power of the pharaoh. The ancient Egyptians were skilled builders; using only simple but effective tools and sighting instruments, architects could build <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> structures with great accuracy and precision that is still envied today.|$|E
50|$|In the {{north-east}} of the Manikata church {{there is}} a medium barren land called Tal-Qargħa. This land contains a number of archaeological remains mainly cart-ruts, old quarry and walls built of <b>large</b> <b>stones.</b> In the land {{there is a}} girna and in {{the west of the}} structure there is a wall some 8 metres long and in it there are five <b>large</b> <b>stones.</b> Parallel to this wall there is another wall, which has six <b>large</b> <b>stones.</b> On top of the hill there is another wall and it there are three <b>large</b> <b>stones,</b> the <b>largest</b> one is 0.75m length and 0.6m breath. Apart from this wall there are another two built from <b>large</b> <b>stones.</b> It seems that during the Bronze Age period in this area there was a prehistoric village and it was defended by several walls against their enemies. The idea of building a village on a hill and surround it by a defensive wall is a typical characteristic of the Bronze Age Period, Borġ in-Nadur. This site has evidence of hut foundations and has the longest defensive wall of the Bronze Age Period. Borġ in-Nadur wall is the best preserved prehistoric fortification in Malta.|$|R

50|$|Circles {{range in}} size from a few centimeters to several meters in diameter. Circles can consist of both sorted and {{unsorted}} material, and generally occur with fine sediments in the center surrounded by a circle of <b>larger</b> <b>stones.</b> Unsorted circles are similar, but rather than being surrounded by a circle of <b>larger</b> <b>stones,</b> they are bounded by a circular margin of vegetation.|$|R
5|$|The {{basement}} {{rooms at}} Wappocomo are located almost entirely aboveground. The house's foundation is constructed of <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> blocks, into which was crafted a large open fireplace that once exhibited a swinging iron chimney crane. The space around this large open fireplace within the mansion's basement formerly {{served as a}} kitchen, {{where most of the}} cooking and food preparation took place. Entry into the home's basement is accessible through a wide and heavy exterior door.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of cathedrals and castles advanced building technology, {{leading to the}} development of <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> buildings. Ancillary structures included new town halls, houses, bridges, and tithe barns. Shipbuilding improved {{with the use of the}} rib and plank method rather than the old Roman system of mortise and tenon. Other improvements to ships included the use of lateen sails and the stern-post rudder, both of which increased the speed at which ships could be sailed.|$|E
5|$|The militiamen {{killed in}} the Battle of Waddams Grove were {{eventually}} interred in a memorial cemetery in Kellogg's Grove. The graves are located beneath a <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> monument dedicated to those militia men killed during the Black Hawk War. The battlefield itself {{is believed to be}} located along the Yellow Creek northwest of William Waddams' original land claims north of the present day unincorporated town of Waddams Grove, Illinois.|$|E
50|$|The process uses <b>large</b> <b>stones</b> to roughen up {{the fabric}} being processed. The {{garments}} {{are placed in}} a large horizontal industrial clothes washer that is also filled with <b>large</b> <b>stones.</b> As the wash cylinder rotates, the cloth fibers are repeatedly pounded and beaten as the tumbling stones ride up the paddles inside the drum and fall back down onto the fabric.|$|R

5|$|The monastery, {{which is}} next to the River Washford, would have been {{surrounded}} by gardens, fishponds, orchards, barns, guesthouses, stables, a farmyard and industrial buildings. The abbey grounds were defended by a water filled moat and a gatehouse. Excavation has revealed that a <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> cross, like a market cross, stood {{just west of the}} main building.|$|E
5|$|After {{civil war}} broke out in England in 1135, the third earl, also called William, set about {{improving}} the defences of the castle. He began to build a tall keep {{on top of the}} motte, reinforcing the surrounding earthworks with stone walls. A planned settlement was established alongside the castle, surrounded by its own earthworks and walls, and the Peddars Way was redirected to pass by the castle, town and priory, all important symbols of the de Warennes' power in the region. Hamelin de Warenne acquired the castle through marriage and curtailed the building work on the keep around 1165, but completed the construction of three <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> gatehouses in the castle and town. One of these, the town's bailey gate, still survives intact.|$|E
5|$|All {{buildings}} have been adorned with elaborate carvings and sculptures and {{were supported by}} <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> columns. These stone columns {{can be seen in}} several buildings such as the Lovamahapaya (brazen palace). Drainage systems of these buildings are also well planned, and terra cotta pipes were used to carry water to drainage pits. Large ponds were attached to some monasteries, such as the Kuttam Pokuna (twin pond). Hospital complexes have also been found close to monasteries. Buildings were constructed using timber, bricks and stones. Stones were used for foundations and columns, while brick were used for walls. Lime mortar was used for plastering walls.|$|E

5|$|Dominating the {{appearance}} of the house from the street is a large verandah-style porch, supported by <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> columns, on the southern-facing front of the house; an enclosed porch, smaller but two stories high and supported by wooden pillars, is located on the rear portion of the house's east side. Projecting {{from the front of the}} house, above the porch, is a small wing with a gable, semicircular window, and elaborate cornice. The house is built in a combination of styles; it includes many Italianate details, but its design appears to have been influenced by the architecture of the Sears Modern Homes.|$|E
5|$|Funds were {{provided}} {{for the purchase of}} a 6-inch (150mm) refracting telescope from T. Cooke & Sons. The dome was originally designed to mount a small transit, and the lengthy telescope, over 2 metres long, had a limited field of view though the dome's opening. A <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> pillar was constructed inside the tower, raising the telescope to bring it closer to the dome and improve its field of view. Unfortunately, the new telescope was unable {{to take part in the}} transit measurements due to bad weather, and missed the 1895 Transit of Mercury for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester, {{called in}} the {{architect}} William Burn to build new stables {{to the east of}} the house, in collaboration with W. A. Nesfield, who had designed the parterres. Work started at the same time on the terraces surrounding the house. This work continued until 1857 and included, to the south and on axis with the house, the monumental fountain of Saint George and the Dragon dated c. 184957 sculpted by Charles Raymond Smith. To the east of the house and overlooking the terrace, Burn designed the <b>large</b> <b>stone</b> orangery, with a three-bay pedimented centre and three-bay flanking wings. The orangery is now roofless and windowless.|$|E
