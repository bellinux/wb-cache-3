Experiment 1 suggested that road situation is {{a major determinant of}} visual and mental workload of the driver and that the processing resources of older drivers are somewhat more limited than those of younger and middle-aged drivers. Familiarity with the area of driving (when guided) and time of day (associated with traffic density) showed no secondary task effects.

Significant research efforts have been dedicated to techniques for efficient processing of spatial continuous queries on moving objects in a centralized location monitoring system. Surprisingly, very few have promoted a distributed approach to real-time location monitoring. In this paper we present a distributed and scalable solution to processing continuously moving queries on moving objects and describe the design of MobiEyes, a distributed real-time location monitoring system in a mobile environment. Mobieyes utilizes the computational power at mobile objects, leading to significant savings in terms of server <b>load</b> and <b>messaging</b> cost when compared to solutions relying on central processing of location information at the server. We introduce a set of optimization techniques, such as Lazy Query Propagation, Query Grouping, and Safe Periods, to constrict the amount of computations handled by the moving objects and to enhance the performance and system utilization of Mobieyes. We also provide a simulation model in a mobile setup to study the scalability of the MobiEyes distributed location monitoring approach with regard to server <b>load,</b> <b>messaging</b> cost, and amount of computation required on the mobile objects...|$|R

40|$|The {{resource}} {{discovery is}} one of the most important services in Grid systems because providing the resources is critical to handle the applications. But some inherent characteristics of Grid environments such as large-scale and dynamicity make the resource discovery a challenging task. The hierarchical structure is widely used in Grid resource discovery but it suffers from high <b>message</b> <b>load</b> especially in upper level indexing nodes. This paper proposes a technique to reduce the <b>message</b> <b>load</b> of upper level indexing nodes in the hierarchical resource discovery. It applies a threshold value for in-process messages of indexing nodes to limit the queries passed to upper levels. The queries are checked in the sibling nodes of current level when they are not allowed to be passed to the parent node. The proposed technique is simulated in GridSim and experimented by different configurations of threshold values and number of Grid nodes. The experimental results showed that the proposed technique is able to reduce the <b>message</b> <b>load</b> of indexing nodes as 21. 2 % however it also affects negatively on the response time of issued resource queries as 19. 3 %. Therefore, the proposed technique is an appropriate solution for the applications with priority of lower <b>message</b> <b>loads</b> relative to the response time...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol for universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) mobile networks, where a new protocol is proposed. In our proposed protocol, the mobile station {{is responsible for}} generating of authentication token (AUTN) and random number (RAND). The home location register is responsible for comparison of response and expected response to take a decision. Therefore, the bottleneck at authentication center is avoided by {{reducing the number of}} messages between mobile and authentication center. The authentication time delay, call setup time, and signalling traffic are minimized in the proposed protocol. A fluid mobility model is used to investigate the performance of signalling traffic and <b>load</b> transaction <b>messages</b> between mobile database, such as home location register (HLR) and visitor location register (VLR) for both the current protocol and the proposed protocol. The simulation results show that the authentication delay and current <b>load</b> transaction <b>messages</b> between entities and bandwidth are minimized as compared to current protocol. Therefore, the performance and the authentication delay time have been improved significantly.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} formalized, fully {{decentralized}} runtime semantics for a core subset of ABS, a language and framework for modelling distributed object-oriented systems. The semantics incorporates an ab-stract graph {{representation of a}} network infrastructure, with network endpoints represented as graph nodes, and links as arcs with buffers, corresponding to OSI layer 2 interconnects. The key prob-lem we wish to address is how to allocate computational tasks to nodes so that certain performance objectives are met. To this end, we use the semantics {{as a foundation for}} performing network-adaptive task execution via object migration between nodes. Adaptability is analyzed in terms of three Quality of Service objectives: node load, arc <b>load</b> and <b>message</b> latency. We have implemented the key parts of our semantics in a simulator and evaluated how well objectives are achieved for some application-relevant choices of network topology, migration procedure and ABS program. The evaluation suggests that it is feasible in a decentralized setting to continually meet both the objective of a node-balanced task allocation and make headway towards minimizing communication, and thus arc <b>load</b> and <b>message</b> latency. ...|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{catalysts}} {{driving the}} atrocities committed by Indonesian Pemuda against the native Eurasian civilian population was the inciteful Republican propaganda. Republican propaganda during the revolution {{was used as}} a form of political warfare, by communicating <b>loaded</b> <b>messages</b> to produce emotional responses and influence the attitude of the masses, with the objective to further its political and military agenda. Effective means of mass communication were the broadcasts of republican radio stations such as 'Radio Pemberontak' and speeches during mass demonstrations. The supreme republican leader Sukarno had mastered these forms of communication. However, during the Bersiap period the republican strategic agenda had not yet fully found a common ground and unitary message how to achieve its single mission of independence. Due to this paradox republican communication often fluctuated between moderate (political) and radical (military) messages. The Republican military declaration of total war (14 October 1945) states: [...] "When the sun sets, we the Indonesian people are in war with the Dutch." [...] The declaration then continues with clearly targeting civilian groups: [...] "With this declaration we order all Indonesians to find their own enemy - Dutch, Indo or Ambonese." ...|$|R

Since no study of a people is {{complete}} without mentioning their language, the paper also gives a very brief account of Fulfulde, the language of the Fulçe people. However, the central focus of the paper is the concept of pulaaku, that unique attribute of the Fulçe that serves as an unwritten code of conduct for all ‘true’ Fulçe. Pulaaku is Fulçe’s guiding principle in their dealings with their fellow Fulçe as well as with all other people. Rather than talk about pulaaku in isolation, however, the paper tries to mirror it through Fulfulde proverbs. Coded or <b>loaded</b> <b>messages</b> called wise-sayings or proverbs are widely used in all languages. Fulfulde is particularly rich in this, which is why the paper explores this reservoir of knowledge in trying to portray the rich culture of the Fulçe people. The corpus of proverbs from which the selected proverbs come, was compiled in and around Gombe with the help of Mallam Bappayo Bappa Yerima Djibril. Since the Fulçe are easily the most dispersed people in Africa, no single study can do real justice to all of them. This is why this study narrows its scope to cover just the Fulçe of Gombe area of the northeastern of Nigeria...|$|R
