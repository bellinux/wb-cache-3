I also appeal for a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness amongst us all...Our beautiful country has been nicknamed `The Warm Heart of Africa' and we have been admired for our warmth and spirit of hardwork. This admiration calls not only for a need for us to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> past and present and draw lessons from it, but there is even a greater need for us to look forward to the future in our endeavours to reconstruct and reconcile if we have to move forward at all.|$|E
500|$|Years {{after its}} release, Stone {{said of the}} film that it [...] "was the {{beginning}} of a new era for me in terms of film making because it's not just about a conspiracy to kill John Kennedy. It's also about the way we <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> recent history... It shifts from black and white to color, and then back again, and views people from offbeat angles." ...|$|E
500|$|.....We felt {{because it}} was 20 years earlier, these are much younger Spartans. They aren't quite as {{experienced}} as Master Chief, and we looked a lot at combat infantry going into actual wars, and typically {{at the beginning of}} a war, especially the Vietnam War, if you look at the infantry, they're all loaded up. They have all the backpacks on, they have all the belts on, every single bit of armor is there, and they're carrying around lots of armor. At the end of the war, they've lost it all and just carry what they need. This is all they have. So if you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> Spartans, they have more pieces of armor on going into the war. They have more markings on there, more pieces of armor. They've still got the belts on, they're still carrying around everything.|$|E

500|$|Much of {{the lyrics}} were {{composed}} by Batmanglij and Koenig in Batmanglij's apartment (a former factory building in Brooklyn) and at a rented cottage on Martha's Vineyard. The lyrics explore more mature, world-weary themes such as growing old and disillusionment with American foreign policy. The album eschewed the theme of privileged youth from their first two albums in favor of characters with adult responsibilities and reflections on the passage of time. Faith and mortality are recurring themes on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", [...] "Worship You", and [...] "Everlasting Arms". Koenig likened their first three albums to Brideshead Revisited: [...] "The naïve joyous school days in the beginning. Then {{the expansion of the}} world, travel, seeing other places, learning {{a little bit more about}} how people live. And then the end is a little bit of growing up, starting to think more seriously about your life and your faith. If people could <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> three albums as a bildungsroman, I’d be O.K. with that." [...] According to Brice Ezell from PopMatters, Modern Vampires of the City is [...] "very much an indie rock record" [...] because of Koenig's voice and diction, which reveals [...] "the youth that he and his bandmates so often strive to shrug off." [...] Ezell asserts that, on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", the [...] "reckless abandon" [...] expressed by the lyrics reveals [...] "the group's grasp on the genuine rebellion that indie rock ought to strive for." ...|$|E
2500|$|Camden's Britannia {{remained}} a standard and highly regarded authority {{for many years}} after his death. A lightly revised edition of Holland's 1610 translation was published in 1637. A new and greatly expanded translation, edited by Edmund Gibson, was published in 1695, and was reissued in revised editions in 1722, 1753 and 1772. Yet another new and further expanded translation by Richard Gough was published in 1789, followed by a second edition in 1806. In an address given in 1986, marking the original publication's 400th anniversary, George Boon commented that the work [...] "still fundamentally colours {{the way in which}} we, as antiquaries, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> country".|$|E

[...] Mike Salmonson, father of an elementary school student, said the matter was [...] "part of … institutional arrogance—a lack of full disclosure and honesty" [...] on the part of district administrators.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the UK's Metal Hammer magazine in May 2008, Heafy said that their new album was to have [...] "more thrash influences, more screaming." [...] He told Revolver magazine, [...] "For the first time, we can't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> songs and say who the riffs sound like. We're really making our own stuff and our own kind of music and art form, and that's exciting." [...] In September 2008, Trivium released their fourth full-length album, Shogun. The album sold 24,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release, debuting at #23 on the Billboard 200 chart as well as #1 in the UK Rock Album Charts.|$|E
2500|$|... "Every {{generation}} writes its own history," [...] said Kenneth T. Jackson, {{a historian}} of New York City. [...] "It {{could be that}} The Power Broker was a reflection of its time: New York was in trouble and had been in decline for 15 years. Now, for {{a whole host of}} reasons, New York is entering a new time, a time of optimism, growth and revival that hasn't been seen in half a century. And that causes us to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> infrastructure,” said Jackson. “A lot of big projects are on the table again, and it kind of suggests a Moses era without Moses," [...] he added. Politicians are also reconsidering the Moses legacy; in a 2006 speech to the Regional Plan Association on downstate transportation needs, New York governor-elect Eliot Spitzer stated a biography of Moses written today might be called At Least He Got It Built: [...] "That's what we need today. A real commitment to get things done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chibnall was {{inspired}} by ITV's hit show Downton Abbey to cast only top actors. [...] "I said, 'We have to have cast as good as Downton. ...That was absolutely my shameless aim, to go, 'Okay, you have to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> poster and feel that's going to give Downton a run for its money.' [...] " [...] Executive producers Chibnall and Featherstone and producer Richard Stokes held extensive discussions with the casting directors, who then generated lists of potential actors to whom the producers might wish to offer roles or ask to audition. The casting directors also read all the finished scripts, met with location scouts to see photographs of the anticipated location shoots, and had long discussions with various production department heads to gather {{as much information as}} possible so they could choose the right performers to audition. A key rule for the casting team was [...] "no wankers allowed", as Featherstone put it. The production team refused to consider egotistical, obnoxious, vain, temperamental, or arrogant actors for roles, as they felt it made it difficult for both cast and crew to do their best work.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, CSI {{executive}} producer Anthony Zuiker began casting for the then-unnamed Miami based spin-off. First cast was Emily Procter, as Calleigh Duquesne. Regarding {{her decision to}} leave The West Wing and join Miami, Procter stated that [...] "It was like choosing between a boyfriend that {{wants to be with}} you casually or a man that says I love you." [...] She described her character as [...] "a weird girl [...] bright and very nerdy. She wears a lot of boot-cut corduroy pants and turquoise necklaces and looks like a hippie. I just like to pretend I'm Velma in Scooby-Doo." [...] Adam Rodriguez, Rory Cochrane, and Khandi Alexander were cast alongside Procter, completing the supporting ensemble. For the lead, CBS suggested David Caruso. Zuiker, who stated that he had [...] "heard about the NYPD Blue thing," [...] was initially hesitant. Elaborating, Zuiker stated that he [...] "sort of jumped in and said, 'Naw, I don't know about this guy. The show's tough enough to get off the ground and I don't want to walk into any problems." [...] CBS president Les Moonves had announced in January that a Miami spin-off was imminent, yet [...] "It wasn't until we sort of, like, at the eleventh hour, really started to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> options as to who was going to play Horatio, [...] revisited Caruso. And [...] said, 'Yeah, we'll have him come out for dinner, see what he's about.'" [...] Caruso was later cast as Caine. He was the last pilot cast member to be contracted to series.|$|E
