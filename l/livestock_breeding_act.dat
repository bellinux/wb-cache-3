Continuous {{and steady}} {{development}} of <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding</b> in Jiangxi Province, while brings enormous economic benefits to society, also has brought great impaction on natural environment. This paper estimated {{the output of}} pollutants (CODcr, BOD 5, NH 3 -N, TP, TN) and average TP/TN load on unit area of farmland from <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding</b> in Jiangxi province and analyzed the distribution characteristics of pollutants during 2007 [...] 2009. The output of main pollutants (CODcr, BOD 5, NH 3 -N, TP and TN) from <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding</b> in Jiangxi Province increased slightly; high load regions of TP/TN were mainly distributed in the areas with high total and those with relatively smaller area of farmland although the output is lower; output of pollutants from <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding</b> in Jiangxi had exceeded the local farmland bearing capability. Relevant departments should take measures to control non-point pollution from <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding...</b>|$|R

40|$|Non-point source {{pollution}} {{is widely considered}} {{a serious threat to}} drinking water. Eutrophication in Chinese watershed is mainly due to nitrogen and phosphorus output from agricultural source. Taihu Lake is a typical eutrophic lake in China, a basin representative {{for the study of the}} temporal-spatial characteristics of pollution loading of nitrogen and phosphorus to provide scientific basis for reasonable estimation and targeted control measures of nitrogen and phosphorus loss. Based on data from nitrogen and phosphorus loss in agricultural land, <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding,</b> domestic discharge and aquaculture, this study calculated the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus comprehensive loss risk for each pollution source. Using the superposition of ArcGIS raster data, we also described the spatial distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus comprehensive loss risk by the formula of comprehensive loss risk. The results showed that critical risk areas of nitrogen and phosphorus loss mainly originated from <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding</b> and agricultural land during flood period in Tiaoxi watershed. Agricultural land and <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding</b> sources formed major parts of nitrogen loss, accounting for 30. 85 % and 36. 18 %, respectively, while phosphorus loss mainly originated from <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding</b> (56. 28 %). During non-flood period, integrated management of <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding</b> and domestic discharge requires much attention to control nitrogen and phosphorus loss in the critical risk area. Finally, it is of great practical significance to propose spatial-temporal targeted measurements to control nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in watershed for various periods and different areas...|$|R

40|$|Indexación: Web of Science; ScieloBackground: The {{infectious}} diseases in the <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding</b> industry represent a significant drawback that generates substantial economic loss and {{have led to}} the indiscriminate use of antibiotics. The formulation of polymeric microparticles loaded with antibiotics for veterinary use can: reduce the number of required doses; protect the drug from inactivation; and maintain a sustained-release of the antibiotic drug at effective levels. Accomplishing all of these goals would have a significant economic and animal health impact on the <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding</b> industry. Results: In this work, we formulated ceftiofur-loaded PHBV microparticles (PHBV-CEF) with a spherical shape, a smooth surface and diameter sizes between 1. 65 and 2. 37 μm. The encapsulation efficiency was 39. 5 ± 1. 1 % w/w, and we obtained a sustained release of ceftiofur in PBS-buffer (pH 7. 4) over 7 days. The antibacterial activity of ceftiofur was preserved after the encapsulation procedure, and toxicity of PHBV-CEF microparticles evaluated by MTS was represented by an IC 50 > 10 mg/mL. Conclusions: Our results suggest that PHBV-CEF particles have a potential application for improving the treatment of {{infectious diseases}} in the <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding</b> industry.
