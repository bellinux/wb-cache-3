50|$|Spaced {{throughout}} {{the upper half}} of the cylinder are niches of varying size. Some are self-contained. Others are connected to each other by tunnels. The <b>lost</b> <b>ones</b> can climb into a niche by ladders which are distributed {{throughout the}} cylinder. The ladders are often missing rungs at irregular intervals. Most of the <b>lost</b> <b>ones</b> have an irrepressible desire to climb the ladders, and there are large queues around the base of each <b>one,</b> as the <b>lost</b> <b>ones</b> wait their turn to climb.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} {{has three}} separate, informal bands of activity. Around the periphery are the climbers {{waiting for their}} turns on the ladders. The periphery is also where the sedentary and vanquished <b>lost</b> <b>ones</b> prefer to lean against the wall, uninterested in searching or climbing anymore. As they are underfoot of the climbers, they are viewed as an annoyance. Just in from the outer band is an Indian file line of <b>lost</b> <b>ones</b> who are weary of searching {{in the center of}} the sphere, where most of the <b>lost</b> <b>ones</b> reside.|$|R
