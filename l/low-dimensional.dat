25|$|Summary {{statistics}} {{may be used}} {{to increase}} the acceptance rate of ABC for high-dimensional data. <b>Low-dimensional</b> sufficient statistics are optimal for this purpose, as they capture all relevant information present in the data in the simplest possible form. However, <b>low-dimensional</b> sufficient statistics are typically unattainable for statistical models where ABC-based inference is most relevant, and consequently, some heuristic is usually necessary to identify useful <b>low-dimensional</b> summary statistics. The use of a set of poorly chosen summary statistics will often lead to inflated credible intervals due to the implied loss of information, which can also bias the discrimination between models. A review of methods for choosing summary statistics is available, which may provide valuable guidance in practice.|$|E

25|$|<b>Low-dimensional</b> {{topology}} {{is strongly}} geometric, {{as reflected in}} the uniformization theorem in 2 dimensions – every surface admits a constant curvature metric; geometrically, it has one of 3 possible geometries: positive curvature/spherical, zero curvature/flat, negative curvature/hyperbolic – and the geometrization conjecture (now theorem) in 3 dimensions – every 3-manifold can be cut into pieces, each of which has one of eight possible geometries.|$|E
25|$|Geometric group theory, as a {{distinct}} area, is relatively new, and became a clearly identifiable branch of mathematics in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Geometric group theory closely interacts with <b>low-dimensional</b> topology, hyperbolic geometry, algebraic topology, computational group theory and differential geometry.

25|$|Another core idea of M-Theory {{is close}} in spirit to {{ideas from the}} field of {{compressed}} sensing. An implication from Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma says that a particular number of images can be embedded into a <b>low-dimensional</b> feature space with the same distances between images by using random projections. This result suggests that dot product between the observed image and some other image stored in memory, called template, {{can be used as a}} feature helping to distinguish the image from other images. The template need not to be anyhow related to the image, it could be chosen randomly.|$|E
25|$|At one extreme, all {{geometrical}} and metric concepts may {{be dropped}} {{to leave the}} topological plane, which may {{be thought of as}} an idealized homotopically trivial infinite rubber sheet, which retains a notion of proximity, but has no distances. The topological plane has a concept of a linear path, but no concept of a straight line. The topological plane, or its equivalent the open disc, is the basic topological neighborhood used to construct surfaces (or 2-manifolds) classified in <b>low-dimensional</b> topology. Isomorphisms of the topological plane are all continuous bijections.

25|$|<b>Low-dimensional</b> {{comparability}} graphs: The comparability graph for {{a partially}} ordered set has a vertex for each set element and an edge between two set elements that are related by the partial order. The order dimension of a partial order is the minimum number of linear orders whose intersection is the given partial order. If a partial order has bounded order dimension, then an adjacency labeling scheme for the vertices in its comparability graph may be defined by labeling each vertex with its position {{in each of the}} defining linear orders, and determining that two vertices are adjacent if each corresponding pair of numbers in their labels has the same order relation as each other pair. In particular, this allows for an adjacency labeling scheme for the chordal comparability graphs, which come from partial orders of dimension at most four.|$|E

If v is a non-zero vector such that Tv is a scalar multiple of v, then the line through 0 and v is an invariant set under T and v is called a characteristic vector or eigenvector. The scalar λ such that Tv = λv is called a characteristic value or eigenvalue of T.|$|E

[...] Raster ICS (RICS), and position sensitive FCS (PSFCS) incorporate the time delay between {{parts of the}} image scan into the analysis. [...] Also, <b>low-dimensional</b> scans (e.g. a circular ring)only possible on a scanning systemcan access time scales between single point and full image measurements.

2500|$|In mathematics, Floer {{homology}} is a {{tool for}} studying symplectic geometry and <b>low-dimensional</b> topology. [...] Floer homology is a novel invariant that arises as an infinite-dimensional analog of finite-dimensional Morse homology. [...] Andreas Floer introduced {{the first version of}} Floer homology, now called Hamiltonian Floer homology, in his proof of the Arnold conjecture in symplectic geometry. [...] Floer also developed a closely related theory for Lagrangian submanifolds of a symplectic manifold. A third construction, also due to Floer, associates homology groups to closed three-dimensional manifolds using the Yang–Mills functional. [...] These constructions and their descendants play a fundamental role in current investigations into the topology of symplectic and contact manifolds as well as (smooth) three- and four-dimensional manifolds.|$|E
2500|$|ABC {{can be used}} {{to infer}} {{problems}} in high-dimensional parameter spaces, although one should account for the possibility of overfitting (e.g., see the model selection methods in [...] and [...] ). However, the probability of accepting the simulated values for the parameters under a given tolerance with the ABC rejection algorithm typically decreases exponentially with increasing dimensionality of the parameter space (due to the global acceptance criterion). Although no computational method (based on ABC or not) seems to be able to break the curse-of-dimensionality, methods have recently been developed to handle high-dimensional parameter spaces under certain assumptions (e.g., based on polynomial approximation on sparse grids, which could potentially heavily reduce the simulation times for ABC). However, the applicability of such methods is problem dependent, and the difficulty of exploring parameter spaces should in general not be underestimated. For example, the introduction of deterministic global parameter estimation led to reports that the global optima obtained in several previous studies of <b>low-dimensional</b> problems were incorrect. For certain problems, it might therefore be difficult to know whether the model is incorrect or, as discussed above, whether the explored region of the parameter space is inappropriate. A more pragmatic approach is to cut the scope of the problem through model reduction.|$|E
