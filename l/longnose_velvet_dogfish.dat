50|$|The <b>longnose</b> <b>velvet</b> <b>dogfish,</b> Centroselachus crepidater, is a {{sleeper shark}} {{of the family}} Somniosidae, found circumglobally in {{southern}} hemisphere subtropical seas, at depths of between 230 and 1,500 m. It reaches a length of 130 cm.|$|E

New {{microsatellite}} loci for the <b>longnose</b> <b>velvet</b> <b>dogfish</b> Centroselachus crepidater (Squaliformes: Somniosidae) {{and other}} deep sea sharks. Conservation Genetic Resources, 3, (1), 173 - 176. IMPF: 00. 48 The continuing over-exploitation of traditional coastal stocks {{has resulted in}} the shift of commercial fishing towards deep-sea ecosystems {{in many parts of the}} world. The effects on target and non-target species have been dramatic; particularly for the deep-sea sharks. With the aim of providing tools that will allow the assessment of population genetic structure of Centroselachus crepidater, novel microsatellite loci have been developed for this deep-sea elasmobranch. Seven of these markers showed between 3 and 7 alleles per locus in two North Atlantic populations, with observed and expected heterozygosities between 0. 18 ? 0. 95 and 0. 25 ? 0. 82, respectively. Additionally, ten loci cross-amplify in other Elasmobranch species. Peer reviewe...|$|E

5000|$|The Japanese <b>velvet</b> <b>dogfish,</b> Scymnodon ichiharai, is a {{harmless}} deepwater sleeper shark {{of the family}} Somniosidae, found in the northwest Pacific from Suruga Bay and adjacent waters of Japan at depths of between 500 and 800 m. [...] Reproduction is ovoviviparous.|$|R

Two specimens of total length (TL) 280 mm and 322 mm were caught by a deep-sea trawler at depths 280 - 350 m. The specimens are described and figured...|$|R
5000|$|The largespine <b>velvet</b> <b>dogfish,</b> Scymnodon macracanthus, is a shark of {{the family}} Somniosidae, found on the lower {{continental}} slopes between latitudes 50°S and 54°S in the southeast Pacific Ocean from the Straits of Magellan, and the southwest Pacific from New Zealand, at depths of between 650 and 920 m. Its length is up to 68 cm.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>velvet</b> <b>dogfish,</b> Zameus squamulosus, {{the only}} member of the genus Zameus, is a {{harmless}} sleeper shark of the family Somniosidae, found around the world between latitudes 64°N and 48°S, from the surface to 2,000 m. Its length is up to 84 cm. Although sharks within the family Somniosidae have generally been accepted to be non-luminous, Zameus squamulosus has photophores on its ventral epidermis.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results on nine {{of the most important}} elasmobranch fish species of the nine years (2001 - 2009) of the Porcupine bank Spanish surveys. The main species in biomass terms in Porcupine bank bottom trawl survey, in decreasing biomass abundance order, are: blackmouth catshark, birdbeak <b>dogfish,</b> <b>velvet</b> belly, Knifetooth <b>dogfish,</b> lesser spotted dogfish, bluntnose sixgill shark, sandy ray, cuckoo ray and common skate. Many of these species occupy mainly the deep areas covered in the survey, especially birdbeak dogfish, knifetooth <b>dogfish</b> and <b>velvet</b> belly. Less confined to deeper grounds are blackmouth catshark and sandy ray, while lesser spotted dogfish and cuckoo ray inhabit mainly the shallower grounds close to the Irish shelf or the central mound in the bank. Length distributions of these species along the survey series are also presented and discussed. The few available data on siki sharks from the Porcupine bank survey are also summarized.
