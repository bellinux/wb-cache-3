40|$|The paper {{considers}} a utilitarian {{federal government that}} <b>levies</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> finance <b>a</b> national public good or to effect a redistributive policy. Regions differ in their incomes and in their preferences for a local public good. First, {{we assume that the}} central government observes each region's public expenditures (and, hence, local tax revenues) but cannot perfectly observe revenues and preferences. We derive the (constrained) Pareto-efficient allocation and show how it can be implemented by a “surcharge” on local taxes. The level of redistribution that can be achieved is limited {{by the fact that it}} may be difficult, or even impossible, to distinguish low-income regions with a high preference for the public good from high-income regions with a low preference. Then we allow for the possibility that the central government can observe incomes through a costly audit. We examine the optimal audit policy and study the impact of audits on the optimal taxation scheme. Throughout the paper we focus on the properties of average and marginal tax rates and on the resulting under- or overprovision of regional public goods...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe end of cold war levels of defense expenditures has promoted {{the reduction in}} the number of defense-related companies, creating potential monopolistic economic scenarios for defense procurement. This thesis studies one methodology to deal with these scenarios, based on the Baron-Myerson monopolist regulation mechanisms. The Baron-Myerson mechanism provides a tool to regulate monopolists when their costs are unknown or cannot be measured, because it is designed as to compel the producer to reveal its costs by maximizing the company's profit when it announces their true value. The government presents a modified purchasing plan to the producer, buys according to the announced costs and pays <b>a</b> subsidy (or <b>levies</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax)</b> <b>to</b> the producer. To apply Baron-Myerson the government needs to know the demand for the good or service it requires, and an estimate of probability density function for the possible costs of the project. This second assumption is the issue addressed in this thesis. The thesis establishes selection criteria and policy recommendations that the government can use to choose a probability density function for the application of Baron-Myerson. The criteria is based on the maximization of the expected government gain, given the level of efficiency of the producer. Also, an analysis of the policy implications of the government's choice is made, to determine the effects of a change in policy on the total welfare, the firm's profits and the government gain.

50|$|To a large extent, {{the main}} reason behind this long period of {{hyperinflation}} was unsustainable growth of the money supply to finance the large fiscal deficits maintained by successive governments. Driven by rising tax evasion and losses among state enterprises, the total public fiscal deficit reached 10% of GDP in 1983. Austerity measures pursued by President Raúl Alfonsín trimmed this 4% in 1985, though the 1989 crisis pushed the shortfall to 7.6% (which could only be financed by suspending debt interest payments). Since Argentina could not participate meaningfully in world capital markets given the great investment risk it posed, the only course available was the financing of these fiscal deficits by monetizing them. This meant that the government <b>levied</b> <b>an</b> inflation <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> pay for the fiscal deficits, which in turn contributed to stalling growth.|$|R

Duke Magnus, however, broke the contract and ravaged villages in the prince-archbishopric, including the fortress in Neuhaus.
