5|$|Once a recruit was {{accepted}} he was 'marked' on the arm, presumably a tattoo or brand, to facilitate recognition if {{he attempted to}} desert. The recruit was then issued with an identification disk (which was worn around the neck) and a certificate of enlistment (probatoria). He was then assigned to a unit. A law of 375 required those with superior fitness to be assigned to the comitatenses.

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} {{external}} respiratory function in miners with a varying <b>length</b> <b>of</b> underground <b>service</b> {{in order to}} further develop differential respiratory therapy for evolving critical conditions. Materials and methods. The studies were performed in 530 miners who were able-bodied drift miners and diggers from two Novokuznetsk mines (a study group). The group was divided into 4 subgroups in relation to the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> underground <b>service</b> and age. In both groups, expiratory respiratory function was studied on a «MicroLoop» spirometer (Micro Medical Ltd (United Kingdom), by mathematically processing the Results. Velocity and capacity values were measured. Results. The study has shown similar external respiratory changes: a reduction in capacity indices (vital capacity, forced vital capacity) in the presence of preserved velocity indices, which occur just with a <b>length</b> <b>of</b> underground <b>service</b> <b>of</b> up to 10 years. As the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> underground <b>service</b> and age <b>of</b> the examined miners increase, these disorders progress — there is a significant reduction in capacity and then velocity (MVR 25 - 50) spirographic characteristics. Conclusion. While working in the mine, drift miners and diggers develop a mixed type of external respiratory disorders with a preponderance of restrictive ones. Ventilation disorders progress with increases in the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> underground <b>service</b> and age. When a critical condition emerges at this background, adequate respiratory therapy is obviously one of the leading components of successful treatment.  </p...|$|R

5|$|In , the {{caretaker}} government approved plans to turn Biman {{into a public}} limited company with shareholdings split between seven public sector organisations. As {{a part of the}} restructuring, the government put in place a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) to reduce the man-equipment ratio (MER) of 367:1 (ratio of manpower to aircraft). The industry average at the time was 200:1, and other Asian airlines operated with MERs of about 150:1. The VRS provided compensation based on <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> at a cost to the government of over BDT2.97billion borrowed from the World Bank. Biman management expected to reduce its workforce by 1,600, but 2,162applications were received, many from employees who expected to be dismissed with little or no severance pay if the quota was not met. Biman accepted between 1,863 and 1877 applications, and affirmed that key personnel {{would not be allowed to}} leave the organisation via VRS.|$|E
5|$|In March and April 1918, the {{battalion}} {{took part in}} the defensive actions in response to the German spring offensive, before subsequently taking part in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, launched near Amiens on 8 August 1918. The 6th Battalion joined the advance the following day, striking out from Villers-Bretonneux and taking part in the capture of Lihons. The battalion continued operations to late September 1918, taking part in the advance towards Herleville, but was then withdrawn from the line for rest and reorganisation and did not see any further combat. In November, the members of {{the battalion}} began being repatriated back to Australia as the demobilisation process began. The process was undertaken gradually based upon <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> and as the battalion's numbers began to dwindle it was amalgamated with the 7th Battalion in March 1919.

In 2015, the Royal Canadian Mint featured Macdonald's face on the Canadian two dollar coin, the Toonie, to celebrate his 200th birthday. He also gives his name to Ottawa's Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway (River Parkway before 2012), Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport (renamed in 1993) and Ontario Highway 401 (the Macdonald–Cartier Freeway c. 1968), though these facilities are rarely referred to using his name.|$|E

5|$|Garfield's {{assassination}} by an office-seeker amplified {{the public}} demand for civil service reform. Both Democratic and Republican leaders {{realized that they}} could attract the votes of reformers by turning against the spoils system, and by 1882 a bipartisan effort began in favor of reform. In the previous Congress, Sherman's fellow Ohio Senator, Democrat George H. Pendleton, had introduced legislation that required selection of civil servants based on merit as determined by an examination, but Congress declined to act on it right away. Republicans lost seats in the 1882 congressional elections, in which Democrats campaigned on the reform issue, and in the lame duck session were more amenable to civil service reform. Sherman spoke in favor of merit selection and against removing employees from office without cause. He was against the idea that civil servants should have unlimited terms of office but believed that efficiency, not political activity, should determine an employee's <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> Sherman {{voted in favor of}} Pendleton's bill, and the Senate approved it 38–5.
