25|$|A <b>lifting</b> <b>bag</b> is {{an item of}} diving {{equipment}} {{consisting of}} a robust and air-tight bag with straps, {{which is used to}} lift heavy objects underwater by means of the bag's buoyancy. The heavy object can either be moved horizontally underwater by the diver or sent unaccompanied to the surface.|$|E
25|$|Parachute lift {{bags are}} {{open at the}} bottom. When full any extra or {{expanding}} air will spill out. The shape of an open <b>lifting</b> <b>bag</b> should distribute the volume in a vertical rather than a horizontal direction so that the open end of the bag always remains underwater. If the open end reaches the surface, air will escape from the bag and it may sink.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} <b>lifting</b> <b>bags</b> used on land as short lift jacks for lifting cars or heavy loads or <b>lifting</b> <b>bags</b> {{which are used}} in {{machines}} {{as a type of}} pneumatic actuator which provides load over a large area. These <b>lifting</b> <b>bags</b> of the AS/CR type are for example used in the brake mechanism of rollercoasters.|$|R
25|$|<b>Lift</b> <b>bag</b> {{appropriate}} capacity should {{match the}} task at hand. If the <b>lift</b> <b>bag</b> is grossly oversized a runaway or otherwise out of control ascent may result. Commercially available <b>lifting</b> <b>bags</b> may incorporate dump valves to allow the operator to control the buoyancy during ascent, {{but this is a}} hazardous operation with high risk of entanglement in an uncontrolled lift or sinking. If a single bag is insufficient, multiple bags may be used, and should be distributed to suit the load.|$|R
25|$|Closed <b>lift</b> <b>bags</b> have an {{overpressure}} valve to prevent internal pressure from exceeding ambient pressure {{by more than}} a set amount (around 10kPa, or 1msw) Closed <b>lift</b> <b>bags</b> are intended for use at or near the surface, as they retain the air even in rough seas. They are available in several configurations, including horizontal cylinder, vertical cylinder, teardrop and pillow.|$|R
25|$|Open circuit scuba has no {{provision}} for using the breathing gas more than once for respiration. The gas inhaled from the scuba equipment is exhaled to the environment, or occasionally into another item of equipment for a special purpose, usually to increase buoyancy of a lifting device such as a buoyancy compensator, inflatable surface marker buoy or small <b>lifting</b> <b>bag.</b> The breathing gas is generally provided from a high-pressure diving cylinder through a scuba regulator. By always providing the appropriate breathing gas at ambient pressure, demand valve regulators ensure the diver can inhale and exhale naturally and without excessive effort, regardless of depth, as and when needed.|$|E
50|$|Medium-sized {{objects are}} {{normally}} recovered using a <b>lifting</b> <b>bag,</b> {{and students are}} trained in <b>lifting</b> <b>bag</b> technique. The most common hazard is entanglement with lines whilst filling the <b>lifting</b> <b>bag</b> from the diver's alternate air source. This risk, when coupled {{with the possibility of}} rapid ascent following the freeing of the object from suction caused by it resting upon the sea bed, can seriously compromise the safety of the recovery team if done improperly. Lift bags can be rated up to several tons, but these are beyond the capacity of most recreational divers.|$|E
5000|$|An {{inflatable}} jack, <b>lifting</b> <b>bag,</b> or pneumatic <b>lifting</b> <b>bag</b> is an air {{bag that}} is inflated by compressed air (without a hydraulic component) {{in order to}} lift objects. The bag can be deflated to be reused later. The objects can be of a smaller load such as an automobile {{or it can be}} a larger object such as an airplane.|$|E

5000|$|Pneumatic <b>Lifting</b> <b>Bag</b> [...] - [...] Pneumatic lifting {{bags are}} air-pressurized devices that lift objects.

25|$|<b>Lift</b> <b>bags</b> {{are used}} to bring the load up in stages: a long chain or sling is used to connect the load to a <b>lift</b> <b>bag</b> just below the surface, which is filled to break out the load and lift it until the bag reaches the surface, then a second bag is used to bring the load up further. This {{procedure}} continues until the load has been raised sufficiently. Advantages of this method are a more controlled lift, the facility to use a larger capacity for initial breakout without risk of a runaway. Disadvantages include the requirement for divers to work {{on or near the}} lifting gear when under load.|$|R
