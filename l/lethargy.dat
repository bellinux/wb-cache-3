5|$|The site of S.iniae {{infection}} and its clinical presentation vary from species to species. In tilapia, S.iniae causes meningoencephalitis, with symptoms including <b>lethargy,</b> dorsal rigidity, and erratic swimming behavior; death follows {{in a matter}} of days. In rainbow trout, it is typically associated with septicemia and central nervous system damage. Symptoms are consistent with septicemia, and include <b>lethargy</b> and loss of orientation (as in tilapia), exophthalmia, corneal opacity, and external and internal bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Concussion {{can result}} in changes in mood {{including}} crankiness, loss of interest in favorite activities or items, tearfulness, and displays of emotion that are inappropriate to the situation. Common symptoms in concussed children include restlessness, <b>lethargy,</b> and irritability.|$|E
5|$|The armier {{were men}} from Ariège in the Pyrenees who {{could see and}} talk to the souls of the dead. The mesultane were women and girls in Georgia who plunged into a <b>lethargy</b> and {{travelled}} in spirit {{to the land of the}} dead, to communicate with them.|$|E
5|$|A 2005 {{animation}} film {{produced in}} Spain and titled Gisaku relates {{the adventures of}} a young Japanese samurai named Yohei who visited Spain in the 17th century, in a story loosely taking its inspiration from the travels of Hasekura. Yohei survived in hiding {{to the present day}} due to magical powers ("After centuries of <b>lethargy,</b> he awakes in a World he does not know"), and accomplishes many adventures in modern Europe as a superhero.|$|E
5|$|The classic {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} in children are loss of appetite, abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss, constipation, anemia, kidney failure, irritability, <b>lethargy,</b> learning disabilities, and behavioral problems. Slow development of normal childhood behaviors, such as talking and use of words, and permanent intellectual disability are both commonly seen. Although less common, {{it is possible for}} fingernails to develop leukonychia striata if exposed to abnormally high lead concentrations.|$|E
5|$|The mildest form of hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{is difficult to}} detect clinically, but may be demonstrated on neuropsychological testing. It is experienced as forgetfulness, mild confusion, and irritability. The first stage of {{hepatic encephalopathy}} is characterised by an inverted sleep-wake pattern (sleeping by day, being awake at night). The second stage is marked by <b>lethargy</b> and personality changes. The third stage is marked by worsened confusion. The fourth stage {{is marked by a}} progression to coma.|$|E
5|$|Zinc is an {{essential}} mineral, including to prenatal and postnatal development. Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people {{in the developing world}} and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia, <b>lethargy</b> and copper deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is still}} {{commonly}} parboiled before preparation, evidence suggests that even this procedure may not make Gyromitra esculenta entirely safe for consumption. When consumed, the principal active agent, gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine (MMH). The toxin affects the liver, central nervous system, and sometimes the kidneys. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, <b>lethargy</b> and headache. Severe cases may lead to delirium, coma and death after five to seven days.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the US Mint began minting pennies {{coated in}} copper but {{containing}} primarily zinc. The new zinc pennies pose {{a risk of}} zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. Another patient who ingested 12grams of zinc showed only <b>lethargy</b> and ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins.|$|E
5|$|In a fatal attack, however, it manifests very quickly. In {{a number}} of cases, death has {{occurred}} within 24 hours of {{the onset of the}} infection, while other cases do not last longer than around five days. The virus attacks endothelial cells, rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; once this reaches the heart, the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock. Symptoms include <b>lethargy</b> and an unwillingness to eat, a rapid heartbeat, and decreased blood-cell count, as well as cyanosis of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and oedema of the head and trunk.|$|E
5|$|Of {{concern to}} breeders is the {{condition}} known as uterine inertia, {{an inability to}} expel the foetus due to weak muscles. This condition was present {{in one of the}} foundation cats and appears in some Singapura females today. Individuals with uterine inertia may require deliveries to be made by Caesarean section. Another issue that affects the breed is Pyruvate kinase deficiency, which leads to hemolytic anemia. Typical symptoms includes <b>lethargy,</b> diarrhea, lack of appetite, poor coat quality, weight loss and jaundice.|$|E
5|$|The Flapper awoke {{from her}} <b>lethargy</b> of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, {{put on her}} choicest pair of {{earrings}} {{and a great deal}} of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure... she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had always wanted to do. Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of poisoning are typically gastrointestinal and neurological. Symptoms occur within 6–12hours of consumption, although cases of more severe poisoning may present sooner—as little as 2 hours after ingestion. Initial symptoms are gastrointestinal, with sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea {{which may be}} bloodstained. Dehydration may develop if the vomiting or diarrhea is severe. Dizziness, <b>lethargy,</b> vertigo, tremor, ataxia, nystagmus, and headaches develop soon after; fever often occurs, a distinctive feature which does not develop after poisoning by other types of mushrooms. In most cases of poisoning, symptoms do not progress from these initial symptoms, and patients recover after 2–6 days of illness.|$|E
5|$|Water {{temperature}} {{affects the}} sea turtle's metabolic rate. <b>Lethargy</b> is induced at temperatures between 13 and 15°C (55 and 59°F). The loggerhead {{takes on a}} floating, cold-stunned posture when temperatures drop to around 10°C. However, younger loggerheads are more resistant to cold and do not become stunned until temperatures drop below 9°C. The loggerheads' migration helps to prevent instances of cold-stunning. Higher water temperatures cause an increase in metabolism and heart rate. A loggerhead's body temperature increases in warmer waters more quickly than it decreases in colder water; their critical thermal maximum is currently unknown.|$|E
5|$|When in the hospital, glucose {{levels are}} checked several times daily {{and the patient}} is {{monitored}} for signs of symptomatic ketosis (which can be treated with a small quantity of orange juice). Lack of energy and <b>lethargy</b> are common but disappear within two weeks. The parents attend classes over the first three full days, which cover nutrition, managing the diet, preparing meals, avoiding sugar and handling illness. The level of parental education and commitment required is higher than with medication.|$|E
5|$|Around one {{in three}} {{subjects}} develops systemic symptoms; {{after a number of}} hours, or rarely, delayed for more than 24 hours. Symptoms typically include nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, agitation, headache, generalised sweating and hypertension. Other non-specific systemic effects such as malaise and <b>lethargy</b> are also common. Rarely, other effects are reported such as neurological manifestations, fever and priapism (uncontrolled erection of the penis). Severe pain usually persists for over 24 hours after being bitten. Symptoms of envenomation may linger for weeks or even months. Rare complications include localised skin infection, seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, or respiratory failure. Children, the elderly, or those with serious medical conditions are at much higher risk of severe effects resulting from a bite. Infants have died within hours of a bite, but adult fatalities have taken up to 30 days.|$|E
5|$|Humans evolved {{for life}} in Earth gravity, and {{exposure}} to weightlessness {{has been shown to}} have deleterious effects on the health of the human body. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience space motion sickness. This can cause nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, <b>lethargy,</b> and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise. Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.|$|E
5|$|In {{veterinary}} practice, {{dogs are}} the species most commonly affected by hypothyroidism. The {{majority of cases}} occur {{as a result of}} primary hypothyroidism, of which two types are recognized: lymphocytic thyroiditis, which is probably immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by fatty tissue. There is often <b>lethargy,</b> cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, and weight gain. Furthermore, skin changes and fertility problems are seen in dogs with hypothyroidism, {{as well as a number}} of other symptoms. The signs of myxedema can be seen in dogs, with prominence of skin folds on the forehead, and cases of myxedema coma are encountered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is associated with detectable antibodies against thyroglobulin, although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease. Treatment is with thyroid hormone replacement.|$|E
5|$|More {{than a dozen}} {{peptides}} {{and other}} substances have been isolated from the Gila monster's venom, including hyaluronidase, serotonin, phospholipase A2, and several kallikrein-like glycoproteins responsible for the pain and edema caused by a bite. Four potentially lethal toxins have been isolated from the Gila monster's venom, including horridum venom, which causes hemorrhage in internal organs and exophthalmos (bulging of the eyes), and helothermine, which causes <b>lethargy,</b> partial paralysis of the limbs, and hypothermia in rats. Most are similar in form to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which relaxes smooth muscle and regulates water and electrolyte secretion between the small and large intestines. These bioactive peptides are able to bind to VIP receptors in many different human tissues. One of these, helodermin, {{has been shown to}} inhibit the growth of lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) {{kidney failure}} {{is the result}} of {{ethylene}} glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after getting into antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after getting into antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe <b>lethargy,</b> coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetance may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms are {{dependent}} {{on the type of}} TBI (diffuse or focal) and {{the part of the brain}} that is affected. Unconsciousness tends to last longer for people with injuries on the left side of the brain than for those with injuries on the right. Symptoms are also dependent on the injury's severity. With mild TBI, the patient may remain conscious or may lose consciousness for a few seconds or minutes. Other symptoms of mild TBI include headache, vomiting, nausea, lack of motor coordination, dizziness, difficulty balancing, lightheadedness, blurred vision or tired eyes, ringing in the ears, bad taste in the mouth, fatigue or <b>lethargy,</b> and changes in sleep patterns. Cognitive and emotional symptoms include behavioral or mood changes, confusion, and trouble with memory, concentration, attention, or thinking. Mild TBI symptoms may also be present in moderate and severe injuries.|$|E
5|$|After the kickoff, the Hokie offense {{continued}} the <b>lethargy</b> that had characterized its {{play in the}} first half, as Mike Imoh was stopped for no or little gain on consecutive plays before the Hokies were called for a five-yard illegal procedure penalty. On the next play, Florida State capitalized on the momentum it had gained with Reid's punt-return touchdown as defender Pat Watkins intercepted Marcus Vick's pass, returning it to the FSU 44-yard line. Drew Weatherford and the Seminole offense, with the game's momentum firmly in their favor, wasted no time expanding their lead. Weatherford completed a 6-yard pass, then a 21-yard one, and was aided by a 15-yard facemask penalty against Virginia Tech. Deep inside Virginia Tech territory, the third play of the drive was a 14-yard touchdown rush by Leon Washington. The speed of the drive, after a nearly scoreless first half, frustrated the Virginia Tech defense, which committed a 15-yard personal foul after the touchdown. The scoring drive had taken just three plays and 54seconds, and gave Florida State a 173 lead with 10:23 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, <b>lethargy,</b> and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} red maple, {{especially}} when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. The toxin is unknown, but {{believed to be}} an oxidant because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads {{to the production of}} methemoglobin, which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, <b>lethargy,</b> increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, colic, laminitis, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as blood transfusions, fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes <b>lethargy,</b> sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to sleeping sickness, previous names have included negro <b>lethargy,</b> maladie du sommeil (Fr), Schlafkrankheit (Gr), African <b>lethargy,</b> and Congo trypanosomiasis.|$|E
25|$|Low {{cardiac output}} - Fatigue, weakness, dyspnea on exertion, <b>lethargy,</b> and lightheadedness.|$|E
25|$|CNS {{depression}} with increasingly heavier exposure: drowsiness, <b>lethargy,</b> slurred speech, hypoesthesia, confusion, disorientation, loss of consciousness, {{respiratory depression}} and apnoea.|$|E
25|$|A fever {{is usually}} {{accompanied}} by sickness behavior, {{which consists of}} <b>lethargy,</b> depression, anorexia, sleepiness, hyperalgesia, and the inability to concentrate.|$|E
25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of zinc deficiency may also occur such as: acne, eczema, white spots on the nails, hair loss, depression, amnesia, and <b>lethargy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Use of the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid {{combination}} {{for more}} than one week has caused mild hepatitis in some patients. Young children having ingested acute overdoses of amoxicillin manifested <b>lethargy,</b> vomiting, and renal dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of hyponatremia include nausea and vomiting, headache, short-term memory loss, confusion, <b>lethargy,</b> fatigue, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, spasms or cramps, seizures, and decreased consciousness or coma.|$|E
25|$|These parasites {{can also}} infect birds {{producing}} three different clinical forms: an acute pulmonary disease, muscular disease and neurological disease. Symptoms include <b>lethargy,</b> shortness of breath, tail bobbing, yellow tinted droppings and sudden death.|$|E
25|$|Zidovudine: Although {{administered}} {{often with}} aciclovir in HIV patients, neurotoxicity {{has been reported}} in at least one patient who presented with extreme drowsiness and <b>lethargy</b> 30–60 days after receiving IV aciclovir; symptoms resolved when aciclovir was discontinued.|$|E
25|$|Aseptic {{meningitis}} (sometimes called steroid-responsive meningitis) {{has been}} diagnosed {{in increasing numbers}} in the Norwegian Toller population in recent years. Symptoms include intensive neck pain, fever, and <b>lethargy.</b> Prevalence is estimated at 2.5% in the Norwegian population.|$|E
25|$|Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Nocturnal {{enuresis}} {{could be}} the presenting symptom of type 1 diabetes mellitus, classically associated with polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia; weight loss, <b>lethargy,</b> and diaper candidiasis may also be present in those with new-onset disease.|$|E
