5|$|The first temperature-sensitive RNA element was {{reported}} in 1989. Prior to this research, mutations upstream from the transcription start site in a lambda (λ) phage cIII mRNA were found to affect the level of translation of the cIII protein. This protein is involved in selection of either a <b>lytic</b> or lysogenic life cycle in λ phage, with high concentrations of cIII promoting lysogeny. Further study of this upstream RNA region identified two alternative secondary structures; experimental study found the structures to be interchangeable, and dependent on both magnesium ion concentration and temperature. This RNA thermometer is now thought to encourage entry to a <b>lytic</b> cycle under heat stress {{in order for the}} bacteriophage to rapidly replicate and escape the host cell.|$|E
25|$|The <b>lytic</b> cycle, or {{productive}} infection, {{results in}} the production of infectious virions. EBV can undergo <b>lytic</b> replication in both B cells and epithelial cells. In B cells, <b>lytic</b> replication normally only takes place after reactivation from latency. In epithelial cells, <b>lytic</b> replication often directly follows viral entry.|$|E
25|$|Unlike <b>lytic</b> {{replication}} {{for many}} other viruses, EBV <b>lytic</b> replication does not inevitably lead to lysis of the host cell because EBV virions are produced by budding from the infected cell. <b>Lytic</b> proteins include gp350 and gp110.|$|E
25|$|Immediate-early <b>lytic</b> gene {{products}} act as transactivators, {{enhancing the}} expression of later <b>lytic</b> genes. Immediate-early <b>lytic</b> gene products include BZLF1 (also known as Zta, EB1, associated with its product gene ZEBRA) and BRLF1 (associated with its product gene Rta).|$|E
25|$|Following {{infection}} of a cell, {{a cascade of}} herpes virus proteins, called immediate-early, early, and late, are produced. Research using flow cytometry on {{another member of the}} herpes virus family, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, indicates the possibility of an additional <b>lytic</b> stage, delayed-late. These stages of <b>lytic</b> infection, particularly late <b>lytic,</b> are distinct from the latency stage. In the case of HSV-1, no protein products are detected during latency, whereas they are detected during the <b>lytic</b> cycle.|$|E
25|$|Early <b>lytic</b> gene {{products}} {{have many more}} functions, such as replication, metabolism, and blockade of antigen processing. Early <b>lytic</b> gene products include BNLF2.|$|E
25|$|For <b>lytic</b> {{replication}} to occur, the {{viral genome}} must be linear. The latent EBV genome is circular, {{so it must}} linearize {{in the process of}} <b>lytic</b> reactivation. During <b>lytic</b> replication, viral DNA polymerase is responsible for copying the viral genome. This contrasts with latency, in which host cell DNA polymerase copies the viral genome.|$|E
25|$|Finally, late <b>lytic</b> gene {{products}} {{tend to be}} proteins with structural roles, like VCA, {{which forms}} the viral capsid. Other late <b>lytic</b> gene products, such as BCRF1, help EBV evade the immune system.|$|E
25|$|Unlike <b>lytic</b> replication, latency {{does not}} result in {{production}} of virions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lytic</b> gene {{products}} are produced in three consecutive stages: immediate-early, early, and late.|$|E
25|$|New {{infectious}} progeny virus are {{assembled in}} the cell nucleus. Papillomaviruses have evolved a mechanism for releasing virions into the environment. Other kinds of non-enveloped animal viruses utilize an active <b>lytic</b> process to kill the host cell, allowing release of progeny virus particles. Often this <b>lytic</b> process is associated with inflammation, which might trigger immune attack against the virus. Papillomaviruses exploit desquamation as a stealthy, non-inflammatory release mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{majority}} of species in this family have <b>lytic</b> life cycles, a few may have temperate life cycles.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{bacteriophage}} known to follow the lysogenic cycle and the <b>lytic</b> cycle is the phage lambda of E. coli.|$|E
25|$|EBV infects B {{cells of}} the immune system and {{epithelial}} cells. Once EBV's initial <b>lytic</b> infection is brought under control, EBV latency persists in the individual's B cells {{for the rest of the}} individual's life.|$|E
25|$|The PR and PL {{promoters}} are {{no longer}} repressed and switch on, and the cell returns to the <b>lytic</b> sequence of expression events (note that cII is not stable in cells undergoing the SOS response). There is however one notable difference.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of lambda phages is {{controlled}} by cI and Cro proteins. The lambda phage {{will remain in the}} lysogenic state if cI proteins predominate, but will be transformed into the <b>lytic</b> cycle if cro proteins predominate.|$|E
25|$|The {{prophage}} is duplicated {{with every}} subsequent cell {{division of the}} host. The phage genes expressed in this dormant state code for proteins that repress expression of other phage genes (such as the structural and lysis genes) {{in order to prevent}} entry into the <b>lytic</b> cycle. These repressive proteins are broken down when the host cell is under stress, resulting in the expression of the repressed phage genes. Stress can be from starvation, poisons (like antibiotics), or other factors that can damage or destroy the host. In response to stress, the activated prophage is excised from the DNA of the host cell by one of the newly expressed gene products and enters its <b>lytic</b> pathway.|$|E
25|$|It is {{postulated}} that following natural infection with EBV, the virus executes {{some or all}} of its repertoire of gene expression programs to establish a persistent infection. Given the initial absence of host immunity, the <b>lytic</b> cycle produces large amounts of virus to infect other (presumably) B-lymphocytes within the host.|$|E
25|$|On initial infection, the {{stability}} of cII determines the lifestyle of the phage; stable cII {{will lead to the}} lysogenic pathway, whereas if cII is degraded the phage will go into the <b>lytic</b> pathway. Low temperature, starvation of the cells and high multiplicity of infection (MOI) are known to favor lysogeny (see later discussion).|$|E
25|$|The testes grow in {{response}} to the start of spermatogenesis. Size depends on <b>lytic</b> function, sperm production (amount of spermatogenesis present in testis), interstitial fluid, and Sertoli cell fluid production. After puberty, the volume of the testes can be increased by over 500% as compared to the pre-pubertal size. Testicles are fully descended before one reaches puberty.|$|E
25|$|Latent EBV in B {{cells can}} be {{reactivated}} {{to switch to}} <b>lytic</b> replication. This is known to happen in vivo, but what triggers {{it is not known}} precisely. In vitro, latent EBV in B cells can be reactivated by stimulating the B cell receptor, so reactivation in vivo probably takes place when latently infected B cells respond to unrelated infections.|$|E
25|$|Retroviral vectors {{can either}} be replication-competent or replication-defective. Replication-defective vectors {{are the most common}} choice in studies because the viruses have had the coding regions for the genes {{necessary}} for additional rounds of virion replication and packaging replaced with other genes, or deleted. These virus are capable of infecting their target cells and delivering their viral payload, but then fail to continue the typical <b>lytic</b> pathway that leads to cell lysis and death.|$|E
25|$|T. b. rhodesiense is {{the acute}} {{form of the}} disease and death can occur within months since the {{symptoms}} emerge within weeks and it is more virulent and faster developing than T. b. gambiense. Furthermore, trypanosomes are surrounded by a coat that is composed of variant surface glycoproteins (VSG). These proteins act to protect the parasite from any <b>lytic</b> factors that are present in human plasma. The host's immune system recognizes the glycoproteins present on the coat of the parasite leading to the production of different antibodies (IgM and IgG).|$|E
25|$|Another way for {{bacteria}} {{to defend against}} phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication. The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that <b>lytic</b> ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} aspect of treatment is improving denture hygiene, i.e. removing the denture at night, cleaning and disinfecting it, and storing it overnight in an antiseptic solution. This is important as the denture is usually infected with C. albicans which will cause re-infection if it is not removed. Substances which are used include solutions of alkaline peroxides, alkaline hypochlorites (e.g. hypochlorite, which may over time corrode metal components of dental appliances), acids (e.g. benzoic acid), yeast <b>lytic</b> enzymes and proteolytic enzymes (e.g. alcalase protease). The other aspect of treatment involves resolution of the mucosal infection, for which topical antifungal medications are used (e.g. nystatin, amphotericin, miconazole, fluconazole or itraconazole). Often an antimicrobial mouthwash such as chlorhexidine is concurrently prescribed. Possible underlying disease (diabetes, HIV) should be treated where possible.|$|E
25|$|Meiotic {{division}} in the VE hypothesis arose because of the evolutionary pressures placed on the lysogenic virus {{as a result of}} its inability to enter into the <b>lytic</b> cycle. This selective pressure resulted in the development of processes allowing the viruses to spread horizontally throughout the population. The outcome of this selection was cell-to-cell fusion. (This is distinct from the conjugation methods used by bacterial plasmids under evolutionary pressure, with important consequences.) The possibility of this kind of fusion is supported by the presence of fusion proteins in the envelopes of the pox viruses that allow them to fuse with host membranes. These proteins could have been transferred to the cell membrane during viral reproduction, enabling cell-to-cell fusion between the virus host and an uninfected cell. The theory proposes meiosis originated from the fusion between two cells infected with related but different viruses which recognised each other as uninfected. After the fusion of the two cells, incompatibilities between the two viruses result in a meiotic-like cell division.|$|E
500|$|The {{fruit body}} usually grows to a {{diameter}} of , although extremes of [...] and [...] have been reported. Its shape ranges from roughly spherical, to obovate (egg-shaped) or pyriform (pear-shaped), sometimes plicate (crumpled, wrinkled) around a somewhat fibrous, persistent tuft of mycelium. The puffball is initially covered by a thick, felted, whitish layer (the exoperidium). This is continuous at first but eventually cracks and peels away in thin flakes, exposing a leathery to corky, nearly smooth, light brown to dark pinkish-brown surface. This tough layer of tissue (the endoperidium) measures about 2mm thick, encloses the gleba. In maturity, the endoperidium opens by irregular splits that eventually extend towards the base in a star-shaped manner. These torn segments of endoperidium sometimes turn inside out, sometimes drying rigid, exposing a felt-like internal surface. The gleba is white when young and has a cheesy appearance and consistency. As the puffball matures, it undergoes a <b>lytic</b> process involving water loss. Subsequently, the gleba becomes olivaceous, olive-brown, and finally dark olive when dry, and then develops a characteristic pungent smell. Fruit bodies that grow underground have a conspicuously different morphology–a smooth, chocolate-brown coloured surface that lacks the patches characteristic of above-ground fruit bodies, and their capillitia are [...] with stumpy spines. The fungus is edible when the gleba is white. Its odor and taste {{have been described as}} pungent or earthy and its taste astringent.|$|E
2500|$|Bacteriophages {{may have}} a <b>lytic</b> cycle or a {{lysogenic}} cycle, and a few viruses are capable of carrying out both. With <b>lytic</b> phages such as the T4 phage, bacterial cells are broken open (lysed) and destroyed after immediate replication of the virion. [...] As soon as the cell is destroyed, the phage progeny can find new hosts to infect. <b>Lytic</b> phages {{are more suitable for}} phage therapy. Some <b>lytic</b> phages undergo a phenomenon known as lysis inhibition, where completed phage progeny will not immediately lyse out of the cell if extracellular phage concentrations are high. This mechanism is not identical to that of temperate phage going dormant and is usually temporary.|$|E
2500|$|EGCG, a {{polyphenol}} {{in green}} tea, has {{shown in a}} study to inhibit EBV spontaneous <b>lytic</b> infection at the DNA, gene transcription and protein levels in a time and dose-dependent manner; the expression of EBV <b>lytic</b> genes Zta, Rta, and early antigen complex EA-D (induced by Rta), however, the highly stable EBNA-1 gene found across all stages of EBV infection is unaffected. [...] Specific inhibitors (to the pathways) suggest that Ras/MEK/MAPK pathway contributes to EBV <b>lytic</b> infection though BZLF1 and PI3-K pathway through BRLF1, the latter completely abrogating {{the ability of a}} BRLF1 adenovirus vector to induce the <b>lytic</b> form of EBV infection. [...] Additionally, the activation of some genes but not others is being studied to determine just how to induce immune destruction of latently infected B-cells by use of either TPA or sodium butyrate.|$|E
2500|$|Flow cytometry {{enables a}} {{high-throughput}} homogeneous fluorescent antibody-binding assay for cytotoxic T cell <b>lytic</b> granule exocytosis ...|$|E
2500|$|Enterobacteria phage λ (lambda phage, {{coliphage}} λ) is {{a bacterial}} virus, or bacteriophage, that infects the bacterial species Escherichia coli (E. coli). [...] It {{was discovered by}} Esther Lederberg in 1950 when she noticed that streaks of mixtures of two E. coli strains, one of which treated with ultraviolet light, was [...] "nibbled and plaqued". The wild type of this virus has a temperate lifecycle that allows it to either reside within the genome of its host through lysogeny or enter into a <b>lytic</b> phase (during which it kills and lyses the cell to produce offspring); mutant strains are unable to lysogenize cells- instead they grow and enter the <b>lytic</b> cycle after superinfecting an already lysogenized cell.|$|E
2500|$|The white {{appearance}} {{is created by}} hyperkeratosis (overproduction of keratin) and epithelial hyperplasia. The causative agent implicated is Epstein-Barr virus, the same virus that causes infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever). After the primary EBV infection has been overcome, the virus will persist {{for the rest of}} the host's life and [...] "hides" [...] from the immune system by latent infection of B lymphocytes. The virus also causes <b>lytic</b> infection in the oropharynx, but is kept in check by a normal, functioning immune system. Uncontrolled <b>lytic</b> infection is manifested as oral hairy leukoplakia in immunocompromised hosts. OHL usually arises where the immunocompromise is secondary to HIV/AIDS. Rarely are other causes of immunocompromise associated with OHL, but it has been reported in people who have received transplants and are taking immunosuppressive medication. OHL may also accompany chronic graft versus host disease. Even more rare are reports of OHL in persons with competent immune systems.|$|E
2500|$|Some methods prompt {{production}} with UV radiation, Mitomycin C, or heat shock. [...] UV {{radiation and}} Mitomycin C are used because the DNA damage they produce stimulates the SOS response. [...] Cross streaking {{may be substituted}} for lawns. [...] Similarly, production in broth may be followed by dripping the broth on a nascent bacterial lawn, or even filtering it. [...] Precipitation (ammonium sulfate) and some purification (e.g. column or HPLC) may help exclude lysogenic and <b>lytic</b> phage from the assay.|$|E
2500|$|No Q {{results in}} no {{extension}} of the PR promoter's reading frame, so no <b>lytic</b> or structural proteins are made. Elevated levels of int (much {{higher than that of}} xis) result in the insertion of the lambda genome into the hosts genome (see diagram). Production of cI leads to the binding of cI to the OR1 and OR2 sites in the PR promoter, turning off [...] cro and other early gene expression. cI also binds to the PL promoter, turning off transcription there too.|$|E
2500|$|Non-chromosomal ssrA {{was first}} {{detected}} in a genomic survey of mycobacteriophages (in 10% of the phages). Other mobile elements including plasmids and genomic islands {{have been found}} bearing ssrA. One interesting case is Rhodobacter sphaeroides ATCC 17025, whose native tmRNA gene is disrupted by a genomic island; unlike all other genomic islands in tmRNA (or tRNA) genes this island has inactivated the native target gene without restoration, yet compensates by carrying its own tmRNA gene. A very unusual relative [...] of ssrA {{is found in the}} <b>lytic</b> mycobacteriophage DS6A, that encodes little more than the TLD.|$|E
2500|$|HSVs may {{persist in}} a {{quiescent}} but persistent form known as latent infection, notably in neural ganglia. HSV-1 tends {{to reside in}} the trigeminal ganglia, while HSV-2 tends to reside in the sacral ganglia, but these are tendencies only, not fixed behavior. During latent infection of a cell, HSVs express latency associated transcript (LAT) RNA. LAT regulates the host cell genome and interferes with natural cell death mechanisms. By maintaining the host cells, LAT expression preserves a reservoir of the virus, which allows subsequent, usually symptomatic, periodic recurrences or [...] "outbreaks" [...] characteristic of non-latency. Whether or not recurrences are symptomatic, viral shedding occurs to infect a new host. A protein found in neurons may bind to herpes virus DNA and regulate latency. Herpes virus DNA contains a gene for a protein called ICP4, which is an important transactivator of genes associated with <b>lytic</b> infection in HSV-1. Elements surrounding the gene for ICP4 bind a protein known as the human neuronal protein Neuronal Restrictive Silencing Factor (NRSF) or human Repressor Element Silencing Transcription Factor (REST). When bound to the viral DNA elements, histone deacetylation occurs atop the ICP4 gene sequence to prevent initiation of transcription from this gene, thereby preventing transcription of other viral genes involved in the <b>lytic</b> cycle. Another HSV protein reverses the inhibition of ICP4 protein synthesis. ICP0 dissociates NRSF from the ICP4 gene and thus prevents silencing of the viral DNA.|$|E
