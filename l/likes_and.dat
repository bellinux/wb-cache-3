5|$|Cyan playtested {{the game}} with two people {{sitting in front of}} the game, finding that they would {{converse}} with each other and vocalize their <b>likes</b> <b>and</b> dislikes compared to one person silently playing. Rand and Robyn sat behind the testers taking notes, and could make on-the-fly changes and fixes. Cyan wanted the interface of the game to be invisible, and to craft a game that all kinds of people would enjoy. Early on they had decided that there would be no inventory, enemies, or ways to die; eventually they included a save system as a concession to the fact that it would take most players months to complete the game. Among the problems testers discovered with the story was that Myst initially had no inciting incident. In response, Cyan added a note from Atrus to Catherine that clued players into the existence of a chamber by the dock that played a message from Atrus and explained the game's objectives.|$|E

40|$|Children’s social {{interactions}} {{with their peers}} influence their psychosocial adjustment; consequently, the relationship between class-wide peer liking, same-gender peer <b>liking,</b> <b>and</b> school adjustment was explored in two age groups. Peer liking was analysed using the social relations model (SRM). In Study 1, 205 children (103 female and 102 male, Mage = 7. 15, SD = 7 months) completed measures of peer <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> school adjustment, and teachers completed the Short-Form TRSSA. In Study 2, 197 children (98 female and 90 male, Mage = 9. 87, SD = 5. 9 months) completed measures of peer <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> school adjustment. Both studies yielded evidence of reciprocal <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> individual differences in the ratings of <b>liking</b> awarded to, <b>and</b> elicited from, both peer groups. Multigroup path analysis, with groups created according to gender, revealed that elements of liking predicted different aspects of school adjustment with some variation according to age and gender. Together, {{these findings suggest that}} the SRM can be used to examine peer <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> underscore the importance of children’s peers for school adjustment...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} the relations among children’s effortful control, school <b>liking,</b> <b>and</b> academic competence {{with a sample}} of 240 7 - to 12 -year-old children. Parents and children reported on effortful control, and teachers and children assessed school <b>liking.</b> Children, parents, <b>and</b> teachers reported on children’s academic competence. Significant positive correlations existed between children’s effortful control, school <b>liking,</b> <b>and</b> academic competence. Consistent with predictions, and while controlling for the effects of parents’ education and family income, school liking mediated the relation between effortful control and academic competence. Implications include a focus on proximal processes such as enhancing school <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> encouraging social relationships when designing interventions to promote academic competence...|$|R

25|$|Bourdieu himself {{believes}} class distinction {{and preferences}} are “most marked {{in the ordinary}} choices of everyday existence, such as furniture, clothing, or cooking, which are particularly revealing of deep-rooted and long-standing dispositions because, lying {{outside the scope of}} the educational system, they have to be confronted, as it were, by naked taste.” Indeed, Bourdieu believes that “the strongest and most indelible mark of infant learning” would probably be in the tastes of food. Bourdieu thinks that meals served on special occasions are “an interesting indicator of the mode of self-presentation adopted in ‘showing off’ a life-style (in which furniture also plays a part).” The idea is that their <b>likes</b> <b>and</b> dislikes should mirror those of their associated class fractions.|$|E
25|$|Since chance {{procedures}} {{were used by}} Cage to eliminate the composer's and the performer's <b>likes</b> <b>and</b> dislikes from music, Cage disliked the concept of improvisation, which is inevitably linked to the performer's preferences. In a number of works beginning in the 1970s, he found ways to incorporate improvisation. In Child of Tree (1975) and Branches (1976) the performers are asked to use certain species of plants as instruments, for example the cactus. The structure of the pieces is determined through the chance of their choices, as is the musical output; the performers {{had no knowledge of}} the instruments. In Inlets (1977) the performers play large water-filled conch shells – by carefully tipping the shell several times, it is possible to achieve a bubble forming inside, which produced sound. Yet, as it is impossible to predict when this would happen, the performers had to continue tipping the shells – as a result the performance was dictated by pure chance.|$|E
40|$|Current {{train of}} thought in {{appetite}} research is favouring an interest in non-homeostatic or hedonic (reward) mechanisms in relation to overconsumption and energy balance. This tendency is supported by advances in neurobiology that precede {{the emergence of a}} new conceptual approach to reward where affect <b>and</b> motivation (<b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting) can be seen as the major force in guiding human eating behaviour. In this review, current progress in applying processes of <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting to the study of human appetite are examined by discussing the following issues: How can these concepts be operationalised for use in human research to reflect the neural mechanisms by which they may be influenced? Do <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting operate independently to produce functionally significant changes in behaviour? Can <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting be truly experimentally separated or will an expression of one inevitably contain elements of the other? The review contains a re-examination of selected human appetite research before exploring more recent methodological approaches to the study of <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting in appetite control. In addition, some theoretical developments are described in four diverse models that may enhance current understanding of the role of these processes in guiding ingestive behaviour. Finally, the implications of a dual process modulation of food reward for weight gain and obesity are discussed. The review concludes that processes of <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting are likely to have independent roles in characterising susceptibility to weight gain. Further research into the dissociation of <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting through implicit and explicit levels of processing would help to disclose the relative importance of these components of reward for appetite control and weight regulation...|$|R

25|$|It {{is clear}} to Lizaveta Prokofyevna and General Yepanchin that their {{daughter}} {{is in love with}} the Prince, but Aglaya denies this and angrily dismisses talk of marriage. She continues to mock and reproach him, often in front of others, and lets slip that, as far as she is concerned, the problem of Nastassya Filippovna is yet to be resolved. Myshkin himself merely experiences an uncomplicated joy in her presence and is mortified when she appears to be angry with him. Lizaveta Prokofyevna feels it is time to introduce the Prince to their aristocratic circle and a dinner party is arranged for this purpose, to be attended by a number of eminent and influential persons. Aglaya, who does not share her parents' respect for these people and is afraid that Myshkin's eccentricity will not meet with their approval, tries to tell him how to behave, but ends by sarcastically telling him to be as eccentric as he <b>likes,</b> <b>and</b> to be sure to wave his arms about when he is pontificating on some high-minded subject and break her mother's priceless Chinese vase. Feeling her anxiety, Myshkin too becomes extremely anxious, but he tells her that it is nothing compared to the joy he feels in her company. He tries to approach the subject of Nastasya Filippovna again, but she silences him and hurriedly leaves.|$|E
25|$|Yasuna's {{character}} changes {{between the}} manga and anime {{in regard to}} her level of devotion towards Hazumu and how much she {{is willing to do}} to be with her, especially after Hazumu's transformation into a girl. The first instance of this is when Yasuna confesses her love to Hazumu the first day she returns to school as a girl, but in the anime she does not confess to Hazumu after the change and in fact starts to avoid her. Similarly, during the time when Hazumu is shopping for her first bra, Yasuna shows up in the manga version and helps Hazumu into a very feminine bra, but in the anime it is Tomari who helps her try on her first bra. In episode three of the anime, Yasuna continues to avoid Hazumu despite still longing for her, and it takes an effort by Hazumu to restore their previous friendship, but Yasuna never once tries to avoid Hazumu in the manga; on the contrary, Yasuna tries to be around Hazumu as much as possible in the manga version. During the time when Yasuna holds a curry party in the manga, which is combined with the beach trip in episode seven of the anime, Yasuna tells Tomari that she wants all of Hazumu to herself and she invited the others to the party so that she could see Hazumu's brightest smile. However, during the same scene in the anime, Yasuna tells Tomari that she invited Tomari and the others so that she could learn more about Hazumu and her <b>likes</b> <b>and</b> dislikes.|$|E

Naomi admits to Liam {{that she has}} been feigning interest in things he <b>likes</b> <b>and</b> that she needs to be true to herself, even if it means their relationship won't work. This is what Liam wants, and their relationship becomes more stable; however, when Naomi is forced to come clean over false rumors she spread claiming that she was sexually harassed by a teacher, Mr. Cannon, Liam decides that he needs a break from her. During this time, Annie and Liam become closer and he consoles her after she overhears her mother, Debbie, confessing to her father, Harry, that she kissed her yoga instructor. His consolation causes Annie to believe that Liam is flirting with her, but realizing that this was not his intent, Annie instead advises Liam to stay with Naomi, as she does not want to ruin her friendship again over a boy. Liam begins to have his own troubles when his father returns, pretending that he wants to have a relationship with his son. But when Liam steals very valuable coins from his stepfather in hopes of starting a life with his father, he abandons Liam. Naomi becomes distracted by her pregnant sister Jen returning to town and causing trouble for Naomi. Naomi finds out that Ryan is the father of Jen's baby, and informs him of his impending fatherhood. Jen does not want Ryan {{to have anything to do}} with the future of their baby, but Ryan is insistent that he should be involved. After Liam breaks up with her, a devastated Naomi is raped by Mr. Cannon, who tells her that after her initial false accusations, nobody will believe her. Mr. Cannon and Naomi had been working on a digital media project when they had become close and worked after hours on a project. This is also when Naomi was attacked by Mr. Cannon. Dixon leaves for Australia with Ivy after witnessing his parents having another argument. Harry informs Debbie that he was fired as principal of West Beverly after covering up an incident at school for Dixon. Annie reveals to Liam about the hit-and-run, and he encourages her to confess. Jasper is jealous that Annie and Liam are spending so much time together and sets fire to Liam's boat that he has been working on for a very long time. Liam sees this and attacks Jasper as the police arrive.|$|E
