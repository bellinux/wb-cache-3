25|$|A self-inflicted {{wound was}} the VOC's {{dividend}} policy. The dividends {{distributed by the}} company had exceeded the surplus it garnered in Europe in every decade but one (1710–1720) from 1690 to 1760. However, in the period up to 1730 the directors shipped resources to Asia {{to build up the}} trading capital there. Consolidated bookkeeping therefore probably would have shown that total profits exceeded dividends. In addition, between 1700 and 1740 the company retired 5.4 million guilders of long-term debt. The company therefore was still on a secure financial footing in these years. This changed after 1730. While profits plummeted the bewindhebbers only slightly decreased dividends from the earlier level. Distributed dividends were therefore in excess of earnings in every decade but one (1760–1770). To accomplish this, the Asian capital stock had to be drawn down by 4 million guilders between 1730 and 1780, and the <b>liquid</b> <b>capital</b> available in Europe was reduced by 20 million guilders in the same period. The directors were therefore constrained to replenish the company's liquidity by resorting to short-term financing from anticipatory loans, backed by expected revenues from home-bound fleets.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – In {{contrast}} to common literature {{that suggests that}} trade credit is an extremely expensive source of financing with annual interest rates exceeding 40 percent, this paper seeks {{to argue that the}} average interest rate of trade credit does not exceed the cost of alternative funds, thereby explaining why trade credit constitutes a substantial part of the optimal financing mix of large, <b>liquid,</b> and <b>capital</b> market listed firms. Design/methodology/approach – Besides providing a formula for estimating a firm's actual trade credit interest rate, this paper is mainly based on a descriptive analysis of trade credit use as well as on survey results of a broad range of prior studies. Findings – The paper finds that highly liquid firms use substantial amounts of trade credit, thus indicating that trade credit use per se cannot be as expensive as literature supposes. In line, estimated average interest rates are about 4 to 6 percent. Originality/value – By arguing that actual cost of trade credit use is far from being as high as literature supposes, this paper provides important implications for optimal short-term financing strategies {{as well as for the}} assessment of trade credit use in credit worthiness analyses.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} sources {{and levels of}} {{infrastructure}} financing in the Philippines {{for the last five}} years (2008 - 2012). The mapping of fiscal resources showed that there had been underinvestment in infrastructure. To illustrate, in 2008 - 2012, public infrastructure spending as a share of GDP ranged between a low of 1. 40 percent to a high of 2. 09 percent - a far cry from the target 5 percent of GDP over the medium term. The result of many years of infrastructure underinvestment is woefully manifested in the Philippines' place in quality-of-infrastructure ranking among ASEAN member-states; it is currently second to the bottom. Recently, there had been significant improvements in the government's fiscal position that augur well for more substantial infrastructure spending in the future. New regional sources of financing, the <b>liquid</b> domestic <b>capital</b> market, and a low interest-rate environment also present opportunities for investing in infrastructure by both the government and the private sector. However, it is not only the constrained availability of financial resources that could restrain infrastructure investments but also institutional weaknesses and, therefore, the government must firmly commit to reform policies and strengthen institutions...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{analysis}} {{does not}} suggest that reserves are "too high" {{in the majority of}} Asian countries, though China may be a special case. Much of the reserve increase in Asia can be explained by an optimal insurance model under which reserves provide a steady source of liquidity to cushion the impact of a sudden stop in capital inflows on output and consumption. Moreover, the benefits of reserves in terms of reduced spreads on privately held external debt further explains the observed growth in reserves since 1997 - 98.
