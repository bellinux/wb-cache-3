500|$|Slotted lines {{can measure}} {{standing}} waves, wavelength, and, with some calculation or plotting on Smith charts, {{a number of}} other parameters including reflection coefficient and electrical impedance. [...] A precision variable attenuator is often incorporated in the test setup to improve accuracy. [...] This is used to make level measurements, while the detector and VSWR meter are retained only to mark a reference point for the attenuator to be set to, thus eliminating entirely the detector and meter measurement errors. [...] The parameter most commonly measured by a slotted line is SWR. This serves as a measure of the accuracy of the impedance match to the item under test. [...] This is especially important for transmitting antennas and their feed lines; high standing wave ratio on a radio or TV antenna can distort the signal, increase transmission <b>line</b> <b>loss</b> and potentially damage components in the transmission path, possibly even the transmitter.|$|E
2500|$|A typical {{complete}} filter {{will consist of}} a number of Zobel sections for roll-off, frequency dips and temperature followed by a flat attenuator section to bring the level down to a standard attenuation. [...] This is followed by a fixed gain amplifier to bring the signal back up to a usable level, typically 0dBu. [...] The gain of the amplifier is usually no more than 45dB maximum. [...] Any more and the amplification of line noise will tend to cancel out the quality benefits of improved bandwidth. [...] This limit on amplification essentially limits how much the bandwidth can be increased by these techniques. [...] It {{should also be noted that}} no one part of the incoming signal band will be amplified by the full 45dB. [...] The 45dB is made up of the <b>line</b> <b>loss</b> in the flat part of its spectrum plus the basic loss of each section. [...] In general, each section will be minimum loss at a different frequency band, hence the amplification in that band will be limited to the basic loss of just that one filter section, assuming insignificant overlap. [...] A typical choice for R0 is 600Ω. [...] A good quality transformer (usually essential, but not shown on the diagram), known as a repeating coil, is at the beginning of the chain where the line terminates.|$|E

Data of geographic information systems (GIS) in-cluding the distance of distribution line and location of load being key parameter of PEA is simulated using digital si-mulation and electrical network calculation program (DIgSILENT) to analyze power loss of the distribution system. In addition, the capacity and location of DG installed into the distribution system is considered. The results are shown that, when DG is installed close to the substation, the electrical <b>line</b> <b>losses</b> are reduced. However, if DG capacity becomes larger and the distance between DG and load is longer, the electrical <b>line</b> <b>losses</b> tend to increase.

5000|$|The SWR {{is usually}} thought of {{in terms of}} the maximum and minimum AC {{voltages}} along the transmission line, thus called the voltage standing wave ratio or VSWR (sometimes pronounced [...] "vizwar"). For example, the VSWR value 1.2:1 denotes an AC voltage due to standing waves along the transmission line reaching a peak value 1.2 times that of the minimum AC voltage along that line. The SWR can as well be defined as the ratio of the maximum amplitude to minimum amplitude of the transmission line's currents, electric field strength, or the magnetic field strength.

40|$|Renewable {{energy sources}} (RES), {{especially}} wind turbines, {{have become more}} important during the last years. An increasing number of distributed generation (DG) units are connected to weak medium voltage distribution networks in rural areas {{where they have a}} large influence on the voltage and the <b>line</b> <b>losses.</b> Voltage rise is in this case often a limiting factor for the maximum amount of DG capacity. Already current wind turbines with a capacity of 2 MW can often not easily be connected to existing 10 kV feeders. To increase the DG capacity of existing networks without reinforcement DG units can be controlled. This paper proposes abandoning unity power factor used today and letting the converters used as network interface of many new wind turbine generators absorb reactive power to reduce the voltage level. Since reactive power has great influence on losses in the network the use of reactive power is limited. <b>Line</b> <b>losses</b> due to the transfer of reactive power are taken into account in this study. Furthermore the use of curtailment is analysed. Simulations of voltage change and <b>line</b> <b>losses</b> when using reactive power control by the connected wind turbines and curtailment in a simple test system are presented. Without reinforcement of the network it was possible to increase the DG capacity from 2; 7 MW to more than 4 MW in the test network without violating voltage limits. <b>Line</b> <b>losses</b> increase but to a reasonable extent and lost energy due to curtailment is insignificant...|$|R
