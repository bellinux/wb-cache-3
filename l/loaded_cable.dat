40|$|Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) is an {{advanced}} composite material with advantages of high strength and light weight, giving it great {{potential to be}} a new, reliable cable material. Ideal structures for CFRP cables are orthogonally <b>loaded</b> <b>cable</b> structures, where cables are loaded orthogonally or approximately orthogonally by external loads. Using CFRP cables in such structures, e. g. cable roofs and cable facades, has advantages over traditional steel cable structures.

Simulation results will provide information on how the amplitude of vibration and the transient dynamic forces change with the application of spacers.

40|$|Introduction The {{present state}} of {{technique}} is such that cables can now be so manufactured that the capacitances of the various circuits at audio-frequencies, {{with respect to the}} sheath, are very exactly balanced. This balance of the capacitances is adequate in the case of circuits having no unbalanced connections to earth. On the other hand, every connection to earth, even with apparent balance, is likely to involve the inductance and resistance unbalances of each of the circuits to which such an earth connection is made. The dielectric strength between the conductors of a cable is appreciably less than that between the conductors and the sheath and, consequently, the connection to earth of some of these conductors would create a danger of breakdown of the dielectric separating the conductors when the cable is subjected to severe induction. When a <b>loaded</b> <b>cable</b> is subjected to a high induced electromotive force, the presence of connections to earth would permit a flow of...|$|E

40|$|Electrical {{noise is}} {{produced}} by switching transients in the power supply converters which excite resonances formed by stray capacitance and cable inductance. This noise is present {{not only on the}} <b>load</b> <b>cables,</b> but also on ground cables of the magnet and of the converter cabinet. Since there will eventually be a large number of cabinets running at one time, tests were carried out to characterize the noise and to investigate possible techniques for reducing the levels. The tests were carried out on the test girder and converter cabinet set up in 412 area. There were four magnets installed on the girder [...] two 0. 5 m quadrupoles, a 0. 8 m quadrupole, and a sextupole. These tests were carried out on one of the 0. 5 m quadrupoles. It should be noted that with this setup, the raw dc power was supplied at around 70 V. In the final configuration, a 0. 5 m quad will be fed from a 40 V raw supply. Consequently, the switching transients observed during the tests are likely to be higher than will occur in reality. Noise currents contain two main components: a low frequency component at around 50 kHz, and a higher frequency component at around lMHz. It is the latter component which is of primary concern. Currents measured on the dc <b>load</b> <b>cables</b> typically were around one ampere, while currents into the building ground system were only a few tens of milliamps. Several methods were used to try reducing the noise currents, but only the addition of a series impedance was successful [...] other methods either had no effect or increased the ground currents...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Twenty {{fresh frozen}} cadaver {{shoulders}} were dissected {{in order to}} study the rotator cable-crescent complex. The rotator crescent is a term that we have {{used to describe the}} thin, crescent-shaped sheet of rotator cuff com-prising the distal portions of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus insertions. The crescent was found to be bounded on its proximal margin by a thick bundle of fibers that we have called the rotator cable. This cable-crescent configura-tion was found to consistently span the insertions of supraspinatus and i-ffaspinatus tendons. The dimensions of the rotator cable and crescent were measured by a digital micrometer. The rotator cable was found to be a very substantial structure, averaging 2. 59 times the thickness of the rotator crescent that it surrounded. This anatomic study supports the concepts of stress-shielding of the rotator crescent by the stout rotator cable and stress transfer by this <b>loaded</b> <b>cable</b> system.

40|$|Multistrand anchors {{have seen}} {{widespread}} use, providing strength and stability at hydraulic Corps facilities. However, these steel tendons {{are subject to}} strength reduction as an effect of corrosion. Methods for evaluating the corroded cable strength do not exist to accurately estimate the time until tendon cables {{would have to be}} replaced (at great expense). The following five research tasks are used to address this deficiency: laboratory accelerated corrosion; pull-tests on pristine and laboratory corroded cables; optical scanning; data collection correlated with cross-sectional properties of cables; and development of a method to relate this data to the field. The pull-tests provide measured capacities for seven-strand, posttensioned (PT) cables. An optical scan of the corroded cables provides cross-sectional properties of individual wires within the pulled cables. Trendlines are established for the related peak cable capacities and cross-sectional properties in an effort to determine their correlations. Trendlines for minimum wire area and second-moment short axis diameter are found with low error, making them good predictors of <b>loaded</b> <b>cable</b> capacity. This pull-test dataset has been related back to cable failure in the field, assuming a linear rate of corrosion loss for the cross-sectional properties and required PT capacity...|$|E
40|$|Micro-generations {{and future}} grid usages, such as {{charging}} of electric cars, raises major challenges {{to monitor the}} electric <b>load</b> in low-voltage <b>cables.</b> Due to the highly interconnected nature, real-time measurements are problematic, both economically and technically. This entails an overload risk in electricity networks when cables must be disconnected for maintenance reasons or are accidentally damaged. Therefore, it is of great interest for electricity grid providers to anticipate the load in networks and quicker detect failures. However, computing the electric <b>load</b> in <b>cables</b> requires computational intensive power flow calculations and live consumption measurements. Today’s view of the grid is usually based on on-field documentation of cables, fuses, and measurements by technicians and therefore often outdated. Thus, the electric load is usually only simulated in case of major topology variations. However, live measurements of smart meters provide new opportunities. In this paper we present a novel approach for a near real-time electric load approximation by deriving in live the current electric topology and <b>cable</b> <b>loads</b> from smart meter data. We leverage the models@run. time paradigm to combine live measurements with topology characteristics of the grid. Our approach enables to approximate the <b>load</b> in <b>cables,</b> {{not only for the}} current grid topology, but also to simulate topology changes for maintenance purposes. We showed that this allows a near real-time approximation while remaining very accurate (average deviation of 1. 89 % compared to offline power-flow calculation tools). Developed with a grid operator, this approach will be integrated in a monitoring and warning system and as an embeddable solution for on-field simulation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Hybrid {{composite}} tensioned element on {{the base}} of steel and carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) with strengthened sections was considered as an object of investigation. Strengthening of the most heavy <b>loaded</b> <b>cable's</b> sections is necessary to decrease the difference between maximum and minimum axial forces in the cable, which depends on the deflection. Strengthening of the cable's sections was carried out by the increase of volumetric fraction of steel in some sections by the length. The behaviours of tensioned hybrid composite element with strengthened sections were investigated analytically and by experiment. The hybrid composite tensioned element with strengthened sections was considered as a material of cable net of prestressed saddle-shaped cable roof 50 x 50 m in plan, together with the steel cables. It was stated, that the using of the tensioned hybrid composite element with strengthened sections enables to decrease consumption of cable net materials...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe force density method (FDM) is a {{classical}} method used in linear and nonlinear form. The linear approach presents a quick tool for finding cable net new shapes by solving {{a set of}} linear equilibrium equations for certain topology, boundary conditions and assumed cables force density. The nonlinear approach was introduced to solve cable nets under constraints (assigned certain distance between nodes, limit force or unstressed length in some elements). Any type of constraint introduces nonlinearity. This paper studied the prestressed cable nets and the <b>loaded</b> <b>cable</b> nets. For prestressed cable nets, coordinate constraints to all nodes of the cable net are introduced to modify the shape after graphically examining the preliminary shape. This preliminary shape resulted from linear analysis of assumed distribution of cable force densities. For analyzing cable nets under different load cases, the first load case is analyzed to achieve the coordinate constraints assigned to nodes. Analysis results are node coordinates, cable forces and lengths. Young’s modulus and areas of cables are {{used to calculate the}} unstressed length of all cables using materialization equations, those lengths are used as constraint in the analysis of other load cases. Forces in all cables under different load cases/combinations are calculated. By using this approach, design of cable net under static load is simplified...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the stress state of a wire rope is tedious although analytical solution {{of a simple}} rope subjected to static load is available. While facing the problems involving complex ropes, it is usual practice to take approximations based upon the concepts of an average stress state for the constitutive ropes or for every wire. For a statically <b>loaded</b> <b>cable</b> superimposed with a tensile impulse, practically in sudden lifting of a heavy weight, the coupled axial-shearing strain waves in the cable has rarely been studied and explored through analytical approaches. Based on Costello's force-deformation relationship and elastic wave propagation theory, analysis procedures and results are presented in this paper. Time-dependent coupled axial-torsional displacements and axial-shearing strain waves in a simple straight wire rope, due to a longitudinal impact at one end, are obtained. At the instance of the strike, a pair of coupled primary axial-torsional waves is created and begins to travel in the cable independently with different speed. Meanwhile, a coupling induced secondary torsional wave and an axial wave were observed to travel with the primary axial wave and the primary torsional wave, respectively. Phenomenon such as the traveling, reflections from ends, and intersections of the primary waves {{as well as the}} secondary wave are presented.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} the {{non-linear}} closed-form static computational {{model of the}} pre-stressed suspended biconvex and biconcave cable trusses with unmovable, movable, or elastic yielding supports subjected to vertical distributed load applied over the entire span and over a part (over the half) of the span is presented. The paper {{is an extension of}} the previously published work of authors [1]. Irvine's linearized forms of the deflection and the cable equations are modified because the effects of the non-linear truss behaviour needed to be incorporated in them. The concrete forms of the system of two non-linear cubic cable equations due to the load type are derived and presented. From a solution of a non-linear vertical equilibrium equation for a <b>loaded</b> <b>cable</b> truss, the additional vertical deflection is determined. The computational analytical model serves to determine the response, horizontal components of cable forces and deflection of the geometrically non-linear biconvex or biconcave cable truss to the applied loading, considering effects of elastic deformations, temperature changes and elastic supports. The application of the derived nonlinear analytical model is illustrated by numerical examples. Resulting responses of the symmetric and asymmetric cable trusses with various geometries (shallow and deep profiles) obtained by the present non-linear closed-form solution are compared with those obtained by Irvine's linear solution and those by the non-linear finite element method.
