5|$|The {{interior}} of the building is also similar to how it appeared when the house was constructed. However, a few changes have been made. In 1910 the two marble fireplaces were replaced by brick. The flooring has been replaced as needed. The home's basement, once the main <b>living</b> <b>area,</b> has since been converted several times for other uses.|$|E
5|$|Positioned atop a hill {{dominating}} Cubzac-les-Ponts and Saint-Andr√©-de-Cubzac, the Terrefort-Quancard castle is a wine {{property and}} family house. The main {{building is a}} limestone rectangular body of <b>living</b> <b>area,</b> covered with slate for the roof. The surrounding grape wines, {{most of which are}} Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, span approximately 70hectares of land. Various vestiges remain, including a wash for linen and horses, and a wind-will for flour.|$|E
5|$|The basement, and {{for part}} of the home's history, the main <b>living</b> <b>area,</b> is {{accessed}} via a staircase {{at the back of the}} first-floor hall. The steep stairs still show years of wear. One of the rooms off the main basement is the kitchen where Glidden is said to have experimented with the coffee grinder and his wife's hair pins, eventually leading to his brand of barbed wire.|$|E

5|$|When the {{building}} was finished, it had two classrooms, a kitchen, a laundry room, a pantry, and a main entrance on the first floor. On the second floor, there were three classrooms and a chapel with an adjoining sacristy. The third floor was a <b>living</b> <b>area</b> for the teaching sisters. It had eight cells, a kitchen, a refectory, and a community room. All in all, {{the building}} was a permanent convent and a temporary parochial school.|$|E
5|$|Living {{quarters}} for the senior officers consisted of eight separate well-furnished cabins, each {{provided with a}} small oak table and chair, an oil lamp, shelves and drawers and a canvas floor covering covered with a rug. The entire crew were given goat-skin mats to sleep on. Lighting for each <b>living</b> <b>area</b> was provided by small skylights in the deck above, which were covered by an iron hatch during battle. The officer's wardroom was located forward of the berth deck where officers would eat their meals, hold meetings or socialize during what little spare time they had. It was well furnished with an oriental rug, a large oak table and other such items. Ericsson had personally paid for the costs of all the officer's furnishings.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{planes were}} {{initially}} only fitted at the stern, but additional planes were {{mounted on the}} conning tower during construction of B1, B2, and B3; B4 was not fitted with them and it is uncertain if the remaining boats received them during construction. These greatly improved the boats' depth-keeping, surfacing and diving abilities compared to the A-class boats. These were later exchanged for bow planes; the last boat to receive them was B6, which did not get hers until January 1916. The B-class submarines lacked any internal bulkheads which exposed the crew to the petrol engine's exhaust fumes. In fact mice were used to detect any concentrations of carbon monoxide inside the hull. Ventilation was provided for the batteries, but none for the crew's <b>living</b> <b>area.</b> No accommodations were provided for the crew and {{they were forced to}} improvise while at sea. In recognition of this issue, the crew's endurance was only expected to be four days during the summer and three days during the winter.|$|E

25|$|Frasier's {{apartment}} {{was designed to}} be ultra-modern in an eclectic style (as Frasier himself points out in the pilot). One of the show's signature elements that it became well known for was the apartment's design which included elements such as a slightly split-level design, doors with triangular wooden inlay features, numerous pieces of well-known high-end furniture pieces (such as a replica of Coco Chanel's sofa, and both Eames and Wassily Chairs) and a notable view from the terrace which was frequently complimented by visitors. The main set consisted of the open-concept <b>living</b> <b>area</b> with a sitting/TV space and dining area on the lower level and a piano exit to the terrace on the rear upper level. The set also included the kitchen through an open archway. A small section of the building corridor and elevator doors was built, as was a powder room near the front entrance. Two corridors off the <b>living</b> <b>area</b> ostensibly led to the apartment's three bedrooms. Sets for each of these rooms were built as separate sets on an as-needed basis.|$|E
