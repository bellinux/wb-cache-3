40|$|Zero-tension lysimeters play an {{important}} role in groundwater risk assessments for pesticides in the European Union. In these assessments, measured lysimeter leachate concentrations are usually used directly for decision making. When doing so, one assumes (i) that the lysimeter bottom boundary condition itself did not lead to underestimating field leaching concentrations, (ii) that the number of application years and the duration of the <b>lysimeter</b> <b>study</b> were adequate to measure the maximum concentration in time, and (iii) that the pesticide-lysimeter system considered was sufficiently vulnerable with respect to leaching. These assumptions were tested using simulations with a Darcian water flow model combined with a chromatographic pesticide leaching model. The scenario consisted of a layered light-textured soil cropped with cereals and of multiyear weather data. The groundwater level in the field usually fluctuated between 0. 7 and 2. 5 m depth. The lysimeter bottom boundary condition resulted in pesticide leaching concentrations lower than those calculated for the field system. Simulations showed that a <b>lysimeter</b> <b>study</b> of 2 yr was too short to measure the maximum leaching concentration for pesticides with organic-matter/water distribution coefficient values exceeding 40 L kg¿ 1. The probability that a <b>lysimeter</b> <b>study</b> results in a leaching concentration below 0. 1 µg L¿ 1 by a coincidental favorable combination of pesticide¿soil parameters was assessed by Monte Carlo simulations. This probability exceeded 20 % for pesticides that would give leaching concentrations of 1 µg L¿ 1 under field conditions. Therefore, it is advisable that for each <b>lysimeter</b> <b>study,</b> modeling be used to assess the likelihood that the leaching concentration would be below 0. 1 µg L¿ 1, considering all relevant systematic and random factors...|$|E

40|$|Sewage sludge is {{repeatedly}} applied as fertilizer on farmland due to {{its high}} nutrient content. This {{may lead to a}} significant increase of silver nanomaterials (AgNM) in soil over years. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the ecotoxicity and fate of AgNM under environmentally relevant conditions in outdoor lysimeters over 25 months. Two AgNM concentrations (1. 7 and 8. 0 mg/kg dry matter soil) were applied via sewage sludge into soil. In subsamples of the soil, incubated under laboratory conditions for 180 days, the comparability of outdoor and laboratory results regarding ecotoxicity was determined. The results from our long term lysimeter experiments show no detectable horizontal displacement in combination with very low remobilization to the percolate water. Thus, indicate that the sludge applied AgNM remains nearly immobile in the pathway between soils and leachate. However, Ag uptake to the roots of wheat and canola suggests that the chemical conditions in the rhizosphere induce AgNM remobilization from the incorporated sewage sludge even after two harvesting cycles. At the higher AgNM concentration a steady inhibition of the soil microflora was observed over 25 month in the <b>lysimeter</b> <b>study,</b> while there was no effect at the lower AgNM concentration.

40|$|In many {{countries}} around the world, municipal sewage and industrial wastewaters are typically treated, or sometimes only partially treated, prior to their discharge into surface waters. A major anionic surfactant, Linear Alkyl benzene Sulfonate (LAS), and a degraded product of a non-ionic surfactant, Nonylphenol (NP), are frequently found in municipal wastewaters. When wastewater containing such surfactants and their degraded products is used for irrigation, it can {{have an effect on}} the sorption/desorption and movement of pesticides in soils. Therefore, a <b>lysimeter</b> <b>study</b> was conducted, in summer 2004, to assess the effect of LAS and NP on the movement of agricultural herbicides through a sandy loam soil. The degradation of the herbicides was studied in lysimeters over a ninety-day period. Irrigation water with a concentration of 12 mg L - 1 of LAS and NP was used to assess their effect on the leaching of atrazine, metolachlor, and metribuzin. Moreover, a laboratory sorption experiment was undertaken to estimate the partition coefficients (kd) of the three herbicides with water containing the same concentrations of LAS and NP. Irrigation water containing low concentrations of surfactants (LAS and NP) did not increase leaching of the three herbicides. Therefore, these results would reduce the concerns regarding pesticide leaching through sandy soil brought on by LAS and NP in wastewaters for irrigation, which is becoming more important due to increasing water scarcity in the dry climate regions of the world. Beside the <b>lysimeter</b> <b>study,</b> mathematical models can be used effectively and economically in a very short period of time for simulating herbicide concentrations into soil. PESTFADE, a one dimensional transient flow model, was used, in this study, to simulate the fate of the three herbicides in sandy soils. Another model, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), was also used over mathematical modeling due to its faster execution period and less input parameter requirements, for predicting the concentrations of the three herbicides in a sandy loam soil. The predicted concentrations, from both models were compared with the experimental results from the <b>lysimeter</b> <b>study.</b> Although slight overestimations and underestimations were observed, both models simulated herbicide concentrations in the soil profile satisfactorily...|$|E

40|$|A {{water budget}} for the burial ground area {{prepared}} by Hubbard and Emslie concluded that about 15 inches, almost one-third of the average annual precipitation, normally infiltrates the land surface and recharges the groundwater. Also, evapotranspiration was estimated to average 30 inches annually, and runoff from the land surface was estimated as 1 to 3 inches. More information has become available recently from <b>lysimeter</b> <b>studies,</b> climatic stations, groundwater studies, and stream discharge measurements. These additional data generally support the conclusions above with some modifications. The type of vegetation cover on the land surface affects the site hydrology and water budget components of evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge. The <b>lysimeter</b> <b>studies</b> indicate that about 12 inches more water is lost annually to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration with deep-rooted pine trees present than in areas where bare soil or shallow-rooted grass cover occur. Therefore, recharge in the burial ground area may differ from that with similar soils in forested areas of the Savannah River Plant. Study of the hydrologic properties of soils in the burial ground area indicates that infiltration rates for the soils generally are relatively high, exceeding one inch per hour. Runoff as overland flow tends to occur only with intense rainfall events of 1 inch or more. The soil-water characteristic curves are representative of relatively coarse-textured soils...|$|R

The lower RLD in shallow soil layers of these QTL lines was further supported by the reduction in their crown root number as compared to Swarna (Additional file 1 : Table S 11).

It has been successfully used during the COST Action 66 model comparison. The Weiherbach research area is a small, intensively cultivated catchment in south-western Germany. The soils of the region are developed from loess and are strongly influenced by erosion. An important feature is the abundance of large macropores that cause preferential flow events. Field dissipation and field <b>lysimeter</b> <b>studies</b> with the herbicide isoproturon and the tracer KBr were conducted in a typical Calcaric Regosol for a late autumn {{as well as for}} a spring application scenario. For the <b>lysimeter</b> <b>studies</b> 10 undisturbed soil monoliths (0. 45 m long, 0. 3 m in diameter) from the same field were used to allow for an estimate of the spatial variability of solute transport. During the spring experiment, one half of the field plot and selected lysimeters were irrigated to simulate wet conditions with higher leaching potential. The Weiherbach data set comprehensively characterises the hydrological, agricultural and soil properties of the experimental sites (including site-specific degradation and sorption data for isoproturon) as well as the meteorological conditions during the experiments. In the field studies, depth profiles of isoproturon and tracer were measured at several dates whereas in the <b>lysimeter</b> <b>studies</b> the percolate was regularly analysed. A detailed description of the experimental results and the whole data set as it was used for the comparison of pesticide transport models within COST Action 66 will be given by Schierholz (1999). In the experiments both matrix and macropore flow occurred and the kind and amount of solute transport clearly depended on the precipitation (irrigation) conditions. The autumn application was followed by an unusually wet winter and represents a 'worst case' scenario with deep leaching of isoproturon. After the spring application there were about average meteorological conditions, but the irrigated variants again represent a 'worst case'. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

This <b>lysimeter</b> <b>study</b> {{sets out to}} investigate {{the influence of the}} type of slurry and application rate on the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen lost by leaching. The field trial assesses the influence of application methods on grass yield, sward damage and ritrogen loss by leaching through analysing the effects on a grass crop using two different methods of injection and comparing them with surface application and granular fertilizer. Losses of P from sandy loam soils were found to be minimal therefore contamination of groundwater is thought to be unlikely. Similar leacling patterns were observed from both the cake and liquid sludges at all four rates_ applied, however the liquid sludge released more phosphate than the cake sludge, resulting in higher concentrations recorded. The <b>lysimeter</b> <b>study</b> also found leaching losses of ritrate from both sludge types to be well above the EC maximum permissible level of 11. 3 mg nitrate-N l`l at all four rates. Residual N from the previously cropped soil masked the nitrate concentrations during the initial stages of the study. Losses of N from the cake sludge was lower than from the liquid treated plots due to slow release.

Part of this concept requires in situ crop water reuse from shallow groundwater; and data is needed to quantify the potential use of groundwater by alternative crops. A column <b>lysimeter</b> <b>study</b> was initiated to determine the potential crop water use from shallow groundwater by alfalfa {{as a function of}} groundwater quality and depth to groundwater. The results demonstrated that up to 50 % of the crop water use could be met from shallow groundwater (4 dS/m) in the shallow groundwater experienced increased salinity in the soil profile with time, which resulted in reduced crop water use from shallow groundwater. Yields decreased with time as the groundwater salinity increased and periodic leaching will be required for in situ use to be a sustainable practice. Statistical analysis of crop yield demonstrated that there was significant use of groundwater with an EC of 6 dS/m for a few years.

40|$|The {{conclusions}} of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) following the peer review of an initial risk assessment {{carried out by the}} competent authority of the rapporteur Member State Belgium, relating to the pesticide active substance lenacil are reported. The context of the peer review was that requested by the European Commission following the submission and evaluation of confirmatory environmental fate and behaviour data and an associated argumentation on the potential for effects / relevance of possible groundwater metabolites. The conclusions were reached {{on the basis of the}} evaluation of the representative uses of lenacil as a herbicide on sugar beet and fodder beet for the control of grass and broad-leaved weeds. The reliable endpoints concluded as being appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment, derived from the available studies and literature in the dossier peer reviewed, are presented. The concern was identified, that the assessment of the relevance of potential groundwater metabolites, present in the leachate of relevant <b>lysimeter</b> <b>studies,</b> could not be finalised with the available information...|$|R
40|$|Globally {{agricultural}} production is facing serious challenges {{to provide adequate}} food supply to meet a growing population. However, the reduced capacity of soil to support and sustain {{agricultural production}} {{as a result of}} soil fertility decline is impacting negatively on agricultural growth. Increase in the price of inorganic fertilisers and limited availability of nutrients from organic amendments has reduced progress in improving soil fertility. This research therefore aims at contributing knowledge towards evaluating the maximisation/optimisation of nutrients in compost and secondary treated sewage effluent (STSE) amended soils to meet the nutritional requirements of crops for sustainable crop production and environmental protection. STSE was irrigated on soils (sandy loam and clay loam) amended with greenwaste compost in soil incubation, glasshouse/pot and <b>lysimeter</b> <b>studies.</b> Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) was grown in the pots and <b>lysimeter</b> <b>studies.</b> The incubation experiment showed that for a clay loam, N mineralisation in treatments with STSE alone and combinations of compost and STSE was higher than the applied N. Increasing compost quantity in compost and STSE nutrient integration resulted in reduced net N mineralisation in the clay loam soil. In the sandy loam, increasing compost contribution in compost and STSE nutrient integration resulted in an increase in net N mineralisation. Cation exchange capacity, microbial diversity, quality of available carbon and drying and rewetting cycles influenced the net nitrogen mineralisation dynamics in both soil types. Increasing the contribution of STSE while reducing compost quantity resulted in increased nitrogen use efficiency and ryegrass dry matter yield. The environmental threat to ground and surface water pollution through NO 3 [...] N leaching may be enhanced by the inclusion of STSE in integrated compost and STSE nutrient supply to plants. Similarly, the threat to eutrophication due to phosphorous leaching is likely to be higher with integration of compost and STSE. Ryegrass dry matter yield reduced with increasing compost contribution while the concentration of N in ryegrass herbage for the combinations of compost and STSE was above the minimum requirement for N in herbage for productive grazing and dairy cattle in the pot experiment. Using compost and STSE of similar characteristics, the ideal approach to maximise nutrient potential from compost through irrigation with STSE is when 25 % compost is integrated with 75 % STSE with respect to nitrogen supply.

40|$|Uncontrolled dumping {{of solid}} waste is {{problematic}} and poses a potential health risk. The objectives of Landfill pre treatment are environment friendly disposal of waste by preventing the release and distribution of pollutants. Composting is one applicable method among the available technologies for pre-treating of MSW, since it contains more than 80 % (dry wet basis) of organic fraction and has moisture content about 60 - 70 %. This paper discusses the design and fabrication of improved types of static pile for composting of MSW {{and the effects of}} biological pre treatment (composting) on landfill dynamics. The two kinds of piles Piped system of static pile (SP) and Step grade static pile (SG) have been constructed on the concrete paved ground. Heterogeneous MSW were sorted quickly and mixed well before filling both the structures. After a period of three-months of monitoring composted MSW was used for <b>lysimeter</b> <b>studies.</b> The height and diameter of the constructed lysimeter were 3 m, 1. 2 m respectively. The two columns of the lysimeter were filled with known weight of the sorted raw and pretreated MSW separately. Required physical biochemical parameters were monitored during the study periods.
