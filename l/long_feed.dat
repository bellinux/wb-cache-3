40|$|Abstract—In this work, we {{demonstrate}} a novel compact mechanical beam steering transmitter {{based on a}} direct vertical integration of a 2 -D MEMS-based mechanical beam steering antenna with a VCO on a single silicon platform. By eliminating the <b>long</b> <b>feed</b> lines and waveguide metal blocks, the radiation pattern has been improved vastly, resulting in an almost ideal pattern at every scan angle. The losses incurred by the feed lines and phase shifters are also eliminated, which allows the transmitter to be implemented using only a single VCO. The system complexity has been greatly reduced with a total module size of only 1. 5 cm x 1. 5 cm x 0. 4 cm. This work demonstrates that RF MEMS can be a key enabling technology for high-level integration. Index Terms—Beam steering, micromachining, VCO...|$|E

40|$|The ham mite, Tyrophagus putrescentiae, is {{the major}} target pest of dry cured ham. Ham mites infest {{a wide range of}} stored food {{products}} such as dried meats, dried eggs, nuts, cheese, pet foods and grains (Townsend, 2007). Mites are very small (1 / 2 mm <b>long),</b> <b>feed</b> on the surface of dry cured meat and follow the seam fat to the interior of the bone and interior of the hams. Mites cannot fly, but they can crawl around extensively and may be carried from one spot to another by humans and other insects. Heavily infested materials may have a sweet or minty odor and infested areas will have a powdery appearance from the buildup of dead mites and their coverings (Townsend, 2007). Methyl bromide has been used to fumigate dry cured ham plants and is the only known fumigant that is effective at eradiating ham mite infestations at this time (EPA, 2010). However, methyl bromide is classified as a Class 1 ozone depletion substance and will be phased out for all industries by 2015 (EPA, 2006). A survey of 34 dry cured ham plants indicated that 22 of plants surveyed used methyl bromide fumigation one to five times a year based on the severity of the infestation (Rentfrow, et al., 2008). This demonstrates that methyl bromide fumigation is important to the economic viability of the dry cure...|$|E
40|$|Aerosol {{delivery}} equipment, {{suitable for}} the treatment of bovine respiratory dysfunctions and including 2 parallelly positioned jet nebulizers, was studied in depth {{in order to determine the}} optimal working conditions in the field. Indeed, some factors might reasonably alter the performance of this equipment. Among these factors, the influences of the parallel position of jet nebulizers (in order to accommodate the breathing requirements of the cattle and achieve a rapid treatment), of the <b>long</b> <b>feed</b> pipe delivering compressed air (in order to keep the animal away from the compressor unit), and finally of the ambient temperature were studied, this equipment being essentially used during the winter season. This equipment could accommodate the breathing needs of cattle weighing up to 225 kg if a pressure of 600 kPa was developed upstream to the nebulizers. The rate of atomization was significantly reduced when working at ambient air temperatures (272. 25 K < T < 274. 65 K) close to those encountered in winter. This was especially true when pressure upstream to the nebulizers did not exceed 500 kPa. The immersion of the feed pipe for compressed air in hot water led to an increase in the rate of atomization without raising evaporative water losses, and reduced the drop in temperature in the nebulizer solution. Finally, the rate of atomization significantly increased when the face mask including the nebulizers was maintained so that the nebulizers were in a vertical position or at an angle not less than 60 degrees with respect to the ground.

40|$|Planar {{arrays of}} waveguide-fed slots have been {{employed}} in many radar and remote sensing applications. Such arrays are {{designed in the}} standing wave configuration because of high efficiency. Traveling wave arrays can produce greater bandwidth {{at the expense of}} efficiency due to power loss in the load or loads. Traveling wave planar slot arrays may be designed with a <b>long</b> <b>feed</b> waveguide consisting of centered-inclined coupling slots. The feed waveguide is terminated in a matched load, and the element spacing in the feed waveguide is chosen to produce a beam squinted from the broadside. The traveling wave planar slot array consists of a <b>long</b> <b>feed</b> waveguide containing resonant-centered inclined coupling slots in the broad wall, coupling power into an array of stacked radiating waveguides orthogonal to it. The radiating waveguides consist of longitudinal offset radiating slots in a standing wave configuration. For the traveling wave feed of a planar slot array, one has to design the tilt angle and length of each coupling slot such that the amplitude and phase of excitation of each radiating waveguide are close to the desired values. The coupling slot spacing is chosen for an appropriate beam squint. Scattering matrix parameters of resonant coupling slots are used in the design process to produce appropriate excitations of radiating waveguides with constraints placed only on amplitudes. Since the radiating slots in each radiating waveguide are designed to produce a certain total admittance, the scattering (S) matrix of each coupling slot is reduced to a 2 x 2 matrix. Elements of each 2 x 2 S-matrix and the amount of coupling into the corresponding radiating waveguide are expressed in terms of the element S 11. S matrices are converted into transmission (T) matrices, and the T matrices are multiplied to cascade the coupling slots and waveguide sections, starting from the load end and proceeding towards the source. While the use of non-resonant coupling slots may provide an additional degree of freedom in the design, resonant coupling slots simplify the design process. The amplitude of the wave going to the load is set at unity. The S 11 parameter, r of the coupling slot closest to the load, is assigned an arbitrary value. A larger value of r will reduce the power dissipated in the load while increasing the reflection coefficient at the input port. It is now possible to obtain the excitation of the radiating waveguide closest to the load and the coefficients of the wave incident and reflected at the input port of this coupling slot. The next coupling slot parameter, r, is chosen to realize the excitation of that radiating waveguide. One continues this process moving towards the source, until all the coupling slot parameters r and hence the S 11 parameter of the 4 -port coupler, r, are known for each coupling slot. The goal is to produce the desired array aperture distribution in the feed direction. From an interpolation of the computed moment method data for the slot parameters, all the coupling slot tilt angles and lengths are obtained. From the excitations of the radiating waveguides computed from the coupling values, radiating slot parameters may be obtained so as to attain the desired total normalized slot admittances. This process yields the radiating slot parameters, offsets, and lengths. The design is repeated by choosing different values of r for the last coupling slot until the percentage of power dissipated in the load and the input reflection coefficient values are satisfactory. Numerical results computed for the radiation pattern, the tilt angles and lengths of coupling slots, and excitation phases of the radiating waveguides, are presented for an array with uniform amplitude excitation. The design process has been validated using computer simulations. This design procedure is valid for non-uniform amplitude excitations as well...|$|E
