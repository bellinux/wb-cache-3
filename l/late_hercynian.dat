The meso-and microstructural deformation features are discussed here. On the basis of these, two maps of the different deformative zones within the shear zones have been prepared and both displacements have been calculated.

40|$|During <b>late</b> Palaeozoic (<b>Hercynian)</b> {{low-pressure}} {{regional metamorphism}} in the Pyrenees, exceptionally high thermal gradients existed within the upper crust, and temperatures {{as high as}} 700 degrees C were attained at depths as shallow as 10 km, resulting in large-scale crustal anatexis. Stable isotope studies indicate that the crust was flushed by circulating ground waters to depths of 12 km, but the amount of fluid involved below 8 km was probably not much greater than 50 % of the rock mass, and this fluid apparently did not penetrate the pre-Palaeozoic basement below 12 km. There is no evidence for continental collision in the region at that time, and these data, together with other geological and geophysical constraints, suggest that the most plausible tectonic setting for the metamorphism is a zone of continental rifting, possibly associated with strike-slip movement. Thermal modelling suggests that a transient, high-temperature heat source in the lower crust is required {{to account for the}} observed metamorphic P-T arrays. Among a range of possible solutions, a basaltic sill, 6 - 8 km thick and emplaced at 14 km could generate a maximum temperature array similar to those observed in the Pyrenees...|$|R
40|$|China has {{the largest}} global demand for iron ore resources, with more than 50 % of its demand {{presently}} being met from foreign sources. Iron resources are abundant in China (ca. 80 billion tons of proven iron ores), but high-grade ores are scarce. Most iron deposits in China are low in grade, with an average grade of 30. 62 % TFe. The iron deposits in China are divided into six types: sedimentary–metamorphic, magmatic Fe–Ti–(V), volcanic rock-hosted, contact metasomatic–hydrothermal (mostly skarn), sedimentary, and weathering–leaching type. Sedimentary–metamorphic iron deposits, which are mainly distributed in the North China Craton, are dominated by highly metamorphosed and deformed BIF-related iron deposits. Although these ores average only 30. 35 % TFe, their coarse-grained magnetite is easily recovered during processing. Sedimentary–metamorphic iron deposits {{are the most common}} of the iron deposit types in China and account for approximately 56. 3 % of the proven ore reserves in the country. Iron skarn deposits in China occur along or near the contact zones between Mesozoic intermediate-felsic, medium- to shallow-level intrusions and carbonate country rocks. They {{are one of the most}} important suppliers of high-grade magnetite ores in China. Magmatic Fe–Ti–(V) deposits, which formed in Proterozoic basement rocks during the <b>late</b> Paleozoic <b>Hercynian</b> orogeny, are hosted by mafic–ultramafic complexes with Ti–V-rich magnetite as the major iron ore mineral. Volcanic rock-hosted iron deposits are divided into those hosted by marine and continental volcanic rocks, with magnetite as the main ore mineral in both. Marine volcanic rock-hosted iron deposits are mainly distributed in late Paleozoic rocks of the Altaishan and Tianshan Mountains in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Continental volcanic rock-hosted iron deposits are mainly distributed in the Yanshanian (late Mesozoic) Na-rich intermediate-mafic rocks of the Ningwu and Luzong basins in the Middle–Lower Yangtze River Valley. Sedimentary-type iron deposits are dominantly hosted in Devonian clastic marine formations in southern China and in Mesoproterozoic marine strata in northern China, with hematite as main ore mineral.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Estimation of eroded {{overburden}} at unconformities {{is essential}} to accurately constrain burial histories and predict the timing of hydrocarbon maturation. In the Ghadames Basin, three independent techniques, palaeo-isopach construction, sonic velocity and vitrinite reflectance analysis, were employed. The resultant basin model suggests that only the two most significant unconformities, the <b>Hercynian</b> (<b>Late</b> Carboniferous) and Alpine (early Eocene), have a major control on timing of hydrocarbon charge. Modelling indicates only one period of generation from the Lower Silurian shales on the western margin of the basin, with 95 % hydrocarbon generation prior to Hercynian exhumation. The central basin and southern margin experienced maximum burial during Eocene time. The Middle–Upper Devonian mudstones are the main source rocks {{and they did not}} generate significant volumes of hydro-carbons over the basin centre until Cretaceous time; they are currently within the peak oil generation zone. In Libya, on the eastern/northeastern flank of the basin, results indicate Cenozoic maximum burial, followed by up to 2000 m of Alpine exhumation. The magnitude of this exhumation has not been recognized previously, although it is a critical component of the basin model as it has a major impact on potential hydrocarbon charge in this area. Maturation models predict that the Lower Silurian source underwent two generative phases: (1) pre-Hercynian (Carboniferous) generation; and, significantly, (2) post-Hercynian (Late Jurassic–Cenozoic) generation. The identification of late hydrocarbon generation offers potential for oil and gas to migrate into post-Hercynian traps. Over the western, northern and eastern flanks, the Devonian source rocks remain immature / marginally mature at present day...|$|R

40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. The Taimyr fold {{and thrust}} belt (FTB) {{consists}} of several zones that show evidence for Precambrian, <b>late</b> Paleozoic (<b>Hercynian),</b> and Mesozoic tectonic events. Most scientists point to Precambrian and late Paleozoic compression {{as the most}} intense event, although Zonenshain et al. (1990) argued for a strong Mesozoic tectonic event. Our studies of the Central and Southern Taimyr done in 2005 - 2012 {{in the frame of}} projects supported by the State geological mapping program and by TGS-NOPEC Company also points to important role of the Mesozoic tectonics. The main results are summarized in the following points: 1. The only clear angular unconformity in the sedimentary succession of the Central and Southern Taimyr is between Vendian and underlying rocks. Vendian-Triassic succession does not contain unconformities, although some hiatuses may occur. 2. Pre-Rhaetian unconformity (previously interpreted as pre-Jurassic) may be related to extension event as well as to compression event. 3. Folds in Cambrian up to Upper Permian rock units have very similar geometry. 4. In the eastern part of Southern Taimyr (Tsvetkova Cape area) Permian to Jurassic rocks show similar structural style. 5. Stress axes orientation estimated from the fracture study in Riphean rocks in the Central Taimyr and Permian up to Upper Jurassic sediments {{in the eastern part of}} Southern Taimyr (Tsvetkova Cape area) is very similar. 6. Apatite fission track study of samples from the Tsvetkova Cape area point to ca. 150 — 125 Ma and 75 - 60 Ma uplift/erosion events. 7. In the eastern part of Southern Taimyr all compression-related structures were affected by a younger extension. In summary, our observations do not show evidence for a strong late Paleozoic compression in the Central and Southern Taimyr. Granite intrusions, previously interpreted as Carboniferous, are ca. 250 Ma and may be presumably linked to the Norilsk trap LIP magmatic event. Also worth noting is that there are no Paleozoic ophiolite complexes within Taimyr FTB. Similarity in fold geometry and stress axes orientation shows that Vendian and younger rocks up to Permian in the Central Taimyr as well as Permian and Mesozoic rocks of the Southern Taimyr were mainly deformed during Mesozoic (Early and/or Late Cretaceous) compressional event, also recognized by brittle fractures in the Riphean rock units. These events are approximately synchronous to major collisional processes occurred in latest Jurassic-Cretaceous time in the northeast Asia and may reflect a connection between Southern Taimyr and Mesozoic fold belts of the northeast Asia. The final extension best documented in the Tsvetkova Cape area likely reflects tectonic relaxation processes right after the compressional event and opening of the Laptev Sea rifted sedimentary basin in Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic.

40|$|The {{research}} {{has been focused on}} amphibolite bodies in the eastern Macedonia, nearby vilage Koševo, between Štip and Radoviš. The locality has been extensively investigated for the presence of porphiritic copper mineralization in the Bučim block (mine is placed about 5 km toward the south). Eclogite has been reported {{for the first time in}} the block by Denkovski & al. (1983, 1984). Later on the occurrence was investigated in more details by several authors (Mirčovski, 1991; Mirčovski 1989; Mirčovski 1990 / 91; Mirčovski & al., 1997; Korikovsky & al., 1997). Occurrence of eclogite-amphibolite within the Bučim block is structurally placed between Vardar zone and Serbo-Macedonian masiff. It is about 20 km long and about 8 to 12 km wide. There are different oppinions that Bučim block is a part of Vardar zone as well that it is a part of Serbo-Macedonian masiff. In the sorroundings of investigated rocks there are mixed Precambrian, Paleozioc and Tertiary rocks. Precambrian rocks are represented by various types of gneisses, eclogite amphibolite and various amphibolites. Paleozoic rocks are represented by diabase (SE of Koševo) which cuts amphibole-biotite gneiss. Tertiary rocks are represented by trahite and trachyteryolite dykes cutting muscovite-biotite gneiss. Eclogite-amphibolite is named in accordance to proposed nomenclature for this type of rocks (Carswell, 1990). It is possible to distinguish prograde and retrograde phase of metamorphism in the rocks. Peak of prograde metamorphism is estimated to be at 650 º C and 12 to 12. 5 Kbar. Retrograde phase begun with slight increase of temperature to about 700 º C and significant decreasing the pressure to about 4 to 4. 5 Kbar (Mirčovski 1990 / 91;). Eclogite-amphibolite is medium grained, dark green rock built of omphacite, diopside, garnet, two generations of amphibole (tschermakite-pargasite-hastingsite), two generations of plagioclase feldspars (prograde, 12 to 27 mol% An; retrograde, 46 to 73 mol% An), zoisite, quartz, rutile and titanite (there is sometimes corrona of titanite around rutile). It is possible to conclude that metamorfic peak of prograde phase determined on the basis of Sm/Nd method was T= 260 ą 49 Ma (with starting &# 949;Nd=- 0. 3) achieved during Upper Permian and it could be interpret as the <b>latest</b> phase of <b>Hercynian</b> orogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The Hospitalet mantled gneiss antiform {{consists}} of monzo-granitic orthogneisses, which are overlain by a predominantly pelitic, at least 2. 5 km thick succession of Cambro-Ordovician metasediments. During the Hercynian orogeny the rocks were polyphase deformed and plurifacially metamorphosed. Three stages in its tectonic evolution can be distinguished. Pre-antiform episode NE-SW trending (Dl) folds were formed and overprinted by upright EW trending (D 2) folds and foliations, defining the suprastructure around the massif. Deformation occurred at low grade conditions and NS shortening is indicated, probably accompanied by thickening of the metasedimentary pile. Gneiss antiform formation Within the massif the D 2 structures are overprinted by flat lying to gently inclined (D 3) folds and foliations, defining the infrastructure. The geometry of S 3 {{relative to the}} gneiss-cover contact limits antiform formation to vertical tectonics at {{the scale of the}} massif, accommodated by horizontal extension at the same scale. Subsequently, a low piT ratio metamorphism (650 C/km) took place in the infrastructure, associated with extensive, zonal growth of biotite, andalusite, cordierite, staurolite and sillimanite in highest grade. Structural and tectono-metamorphic considerations suggest that extension was largely accommodated by an extensional shear zone or shear zones of which the infrastructure represents the upper part. Post-antiform episode During isobaric cooling in lower amphibolite facies conditions the infrastructure has been deformed in (1) a 1 km wide zone of mylonitic strain at the gneiss-cover contacts, (2) a 1. 5 km wide zone of (D 4 / 5) refolding SW of the gneisses, (3 a) a km scale recumbent fold in the eastern hinge zone of the gneiss antiform and (3 b) small-scale recumbent (D 6) folds throughout the massif. The antiformal gneiss core acted as a relatively rigid body and the metasediments and mineral zones were draped around it, first in NNE-SSW stretching, afterwards in WNW-ESE stretching, causing (a) seemingly high thermal gradients and (b) the antiformal pattern of the isograds. The three stages {{in the evolution of the}} Hospitalet mantled gneiss antiform are considered to represent early (Westphalian), middle (Westphalian- Stephanian) and <b>late</b> (Stephanian-early Permian) <b>Hercynian</b> tectonics.

40|$|Many of the tectonic units {{recognized}} in the Northern Apennines crop out in La Spezia 1 : 50, 000 Geological Sheet: from bottom to top, the Metamorphic Succession of Punta Bianca (Early Paleozoic to Late Triassic), the Tuscan Nappe (Late Triassic to Oligocene), the Marra Unit (Oligocene), the Canetolo Complex (Paleogene), the Ottone Unit (Late Cretaceous), the Mt. Gottero Unit (Jurassic to Paleocene), the Mt. Antola Unit (Late Cretaceous). The first three units developed above the continental margin of the Adria plate, the remaining four had a substratum ranging from transitional (the Subligurid Canetolo Complex) to oceanic (Ligurid Units) and are considered representative of the so-called Tethyan realm. The Metamorphic Succession of Punta Bianca crops out in the eastern pro¬montory of La Spezia gulf. It is made of by Early Paleozoic fine-grained clastic sediments metamorphosed during a <b>Late</b> Paleozoic (<b>Hercynian)</b> event and by two sedimentary (continental to shallow marine) cycles of Middle to Late Triassic age. The Triassic basins are probably related to early rifting stages con¬nected with the Tethys opening. During the Miocene the whole succession underwent “Alpine” greenschist facies metamorphism. Lenses of discontinuous thickness of cataclastic carbonate breccias (Maralunga and Lerici breccias) are interposed between the Metamorphic Succession of Punta Bianca and the overlying Tuscan Nappe. The Tuscan Nappe sedimentary formations were deposited on a carbonate platform in progressive drowning after the Early Jurassic and in deep-sea environment since the latest Jurassic. New units of different rank, from members to lithofacies, have been mapped within the Formazione di La Spezia, Scaglia Toscana and Macigno. The total thickness of the Tuscan Nappe reaches 3, 500 m and more than 2, 000 m are represented by the Oligocene Macigno turbidite grey¬wacke sandstones. Discontinuous lenses of Oligocene marls and silts (Marra Unit) of probable slope environment are geometrically interposed between the Tuscan Nappe and the overlying Canetolo Complex. The latter is a Paleogene highly deformed assemblage of prevailing shales with subordinate limestones and sandstones, whose original stratigraphy is obliterated. When {{it was possible to}} distinguish discrete bodies of uniform lithology, the “Groppo del Vescovo limestone” (CGV) and the “Ponte Bratica sandstones” (ARB) have been mapped. The tectonic units overlying the Canetolo Complex {{can be attributed to the}} External Ligurids, which were originally closer to the Adria margin and include the Ottone Unit, and to the Internal Ligurids, which were originally closer to the conjugate European margin and include the Mt. Gottero Unit and the Mt. Antola Unit. All the Ligurid units have a similar sedimentary succession since they con¬sist of Late Cretaceous shales topped by turbidites, that can be calcareous (Ottone and Mt. Antola) or arenaceous (Mt. Gottero). Some peculiarities can be pointed out. In the Ottone Unit the shaly portion beneath the calcareous turbidi¬tes (“Ottone flysch”, OTO) is stuffed by olistoliths derived from the ophiolitic suite. The Mt. Gottero Unit includes some chunks of serpentinites and gabbros which are regarded as the original substratum of the sedimentary succession, which at its top reaches the Paleocene. Along the northeastern flank of the Sarzana basin the highly deformed Ligurid units are sealed by a thick cover of continental deposits ranging in age from a possible Late Miocene to the Holocene. Unlike the lithostratigraphical criteria that ruled the mapping of older deposits, unconformity-bounded strati-graphic units were recognized and mapped in the Neogene sedimentary succes¬sion. The Sarzana Synthem (ASZ), the Low Magra Valley Synthem (BVM) and the Pian di Barca Synthem (PBR) have been established together with associa¬ted subsynthems and lithofacies. Fluvial and alluvial fan sediments prevail in the Low Magra Valley Synthem (BVM) and the Pian di Barca Synthem (PBR). Fluvio-lacustrine deposits with lignite seams occur in the basal portion of the Sarzana Synthem (ASZ). Along the NE slopes of the Sarzana basin the same lower units of the Sarzana Synthem (ASZ) are tilted toward SW and juxtaposed by faults to the Ligurids. Tilting decreases progressively moving basinward. The marine area of La Spezia Sheet is almost entirely occupied by a conti¬nental shelf with an extremely regular morphology. It is constituted by some Plio-Quaternary sedimentary sequences that cover an Apenninic substratum faulted and sunk. One morphological peculiarity is represented by the active head of the Levante Canyon that cuts the shelf in its southwestern part. This fea¬ture does not bear any relationships with the subaerial drainage network or tec¬tonic structures. With reference to various types of shelfs of sedimentary construction, this shelf belongs to a category in which progradation and aggradation assume com¬parable importance on the whole, even if their relationship was different in the various phases of development. The seismostratigraphical analysis has confir¬med the presence of a notable reflector with regional continuity and characters of an erosive surface. This reflector divides the sedimentary prism in two parts. The upper sedimentary complex is organized in mainfold complete sequences, bounded by unconformities, as a classical expression of cycles of sea level chan¬ges, due to glacioeustatism. The remarkable thickness of the whole sedimentary prism, that increases toward SE, underlines the importance of the subsidence related to the disjunctive tectonics that has given origin to the basins of the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea. The Upper Pleistocene-Holocene succession is mainly characterized by a transgressive sequence formed by at least three bodies. The widest and thickest body corresponds to the Younger Dryas and represents the fluvial deposit of an extended coastal plain with a well-developed hydrographic network. An acoustically semitransparent layer with typical characters of an highstand deposit rests above all the described bodies. It reaches considerable, but extre¬mely varying, thickness (max 30 m). The structural framework of La Spezia Sheet is dominated by the superposi¬tion of Ligurid “Tethyan” units above Adria plate units (Punta Bianca and Tuscan Nappe). In turn, each of these major assemblages includes tectonically stacked units. The main stacking events can be dated Early to Middle Miocene. From a structural point of view, five areas can be distinguished from west to east: - continental margin. Its framework is determined by different brittle structures, mainly referable to the “Tyrrhenian” disjunctive tectonics active since the Late Miocene. As to importance and frequency, step faults of Apenninic trend, which lower the substratum towards SW, prevail. They are intersected by NE-trending transfer lines. E-W trending normal faults are more rare. A narrow belt of the substratum is deformed by some listric reverse faults, which also displace part of the sedimentary cover, producing large thrusts. Trend and continuity of these structures parallel those of the Apenninic step faults; - western promontory of La Spezia gulf: The Tuscan Nappe, the Marra Unit and the Canetolo Complex are here involved in a large, SW verging, overturned fold (“La Spezia fold”) which can be traced southward beyond the La Spezia gulf. This “Tyrrhenian” vergence, opposite to the common “Adriatic” vergence of the northern Apennine structures, has been tentatively related to a backthrust in the generally Adriatic-oriented displacement of the tectonic units. - eastern promontory of La Spezia gulf and La Spezia hinterland: in the sou¬thernmost portion of the promontory the Metamorphic Succession of Punta Bianca and the overlying Tuscan Nappe are antiformally folded. The Tuscan Nappe is involved also in low-angle normal faulting. To the North, a larg slab of “Mt. Gottero sandstone” (GOT) is locally involved in N to NE verging recum¬bent folding. A major NW-trending, high-angle normal fault (“La Spezia fault”) juxtaposes the Tuscan Nappe of the western promontory against the Mt. Gottero tectonic unit. - the Sarzana basin: like many other similar Neogene structures in the Apennines, this basin is a half graben bounded by NW trending border faults, the master fault being adjacent to the Punta Bianca promontory. It is possible that these pronounced NW/SE Apenninic lineaments were acquired during rather late stages of the basin development. - northeastern areas (Mt. Grosso/Mt. Tanna ridge) : the core of this ridge is a Tuscan Nappe anticline. On both limbs of the anticline repeated thrusts of Ligurid and Subligurids units make up a belt of highly deformed rocks. A schematic structural history of the region includes the following succession of events: in connection with a subduction zone dipping beneath the Europe plate, begin since the Late Cretaceous the consumption of the Tethys realm and the stacking of the Ligurid units and their progressive translation onto the Adria plate margin. At the end of the Paleogene their superposition on the Tuscan domain is achie¬ved; end of Paleogene/beginning of Miocene intense shortening in the Adria con¬tinental crust and ensialic subduction produce greenschist metamorphism of the Punta Bianca succession and strong folding with large backthrusts; since the Late Miocene a part of the region is uplifted and emerged with development of continental intermontane basins, bounded by normal high-angle faults particularly active during the Quaternary; during the same time the continental margin is rifted and lowered as conse¬quence of Tyrrhenian Basin formation; some compressive events temporarily interrupt the disjunctive tectonics during the Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocen...|$|R

These depositsare reported to be <b>late</b> <b>Hercynian</b> in age and related to theemplacement of late-orogenic granite not outcropping in thestudied area. Structural and paragenetic studies of theAchmmach tin deposit were conducted in order to establisha general model of the mineralization. From field constraints,the <b>late</b> <b>Hercynian</b> phase {{is marked by a}} transition fromtranspression to extension with deformation conditions evolvingfrom ductile to brittle environments. The transpression(horizontal shortening direction roughly trending E-W) is coevalwith the emplacement of the first tourmaline halos alongseveral conjugated trends (N 070, N 020, and N 120). Thereafter, a tourmaline-rich breccia formed in response tothe fracturing of early tourmaline-altered rocks. Subsequently, during the extensional phase, these structureswere reactivated as normal faults and breccias, allowing theformation of the main tin mineralization (cassiterite) associatedwith a wide variety of sulfides (arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite,sphalerite, galena, pyrrhotite, bismuthinite, pyrite, and stannite). This evolution ends with fluorite and carbonate deposition. The hydrothermal fluid flow velocity, calculated byapplying statistical measures on the tourmaline growth bands,varies with the lithology. Values are lower in metapelites andhigher in breccia. In the general evolution model proposedhere, tourmaline alteration makes the rock more competent,allowing for brittle fracturing and generation of open spacewhere the main Sn mineralization was precipitated...|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} first apatite fission-track thermochronologic data for 17 {{samples from the}} {{southern}} Catalan Coastal Ranges of NE Spain. Thermal histories of Carboniferous metasediments, <b>Late</b> <b>Hercynian</b> intrusions and Lower-Triassic Buntsandstein sediments from three tectonics blocks, Miramar, Prades and Priorat, are derived and interpreted within the geodynamic framework and tectonic evolution of the region. The apatite fission-track ages range from 198 ± 24 to 38 ± 5 Ma and mean fission-track lengths are all < 13. 3 μm. Samples throughout the study area underwent total track annealing during the <b>Late</b> <b>Hercynian</b> magmatic episode, followed by fast cooling prior to the deposition of Lower Triassic sediments. The Lower Triassic sediments and basement rocks underwent a temperature increase during a first Mesozoic rift phase in Middle Triassic-Early Jurassic times resulting in the complete or near complete annealing of the fission-tracks. During a second Mesozoic rifting stage, in Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous time, differential tectonic block activity is observed in the three studied tectonic blocks. Subsequently, during Late Cretaceous a long-period of thermal stability, detected in all samples, {{is related to the}} post-rift episode. The onset of fast cooling registered in the apatite fission track system during Paleogene times is related to the Pyrenean orogeny. Compressional forces associated with the ongoing southern migration of the convergence forces at the Iberian plate boundaries caused unroofing of about 2 - 3 km of material of the Prades and northwestern flank of the Priorat block. Extensional collapse in Late Oligocene-Miocene related to the Western Mediterranean rifting triggered the denudation of about 2 km of material from the southeastern flank of the Miramar, Prades and Priorat blocks. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Studies {{performed}} on the Carcavai fault zone, Eastern Algarve, revealed several deformational features in Plio-Quaternary sediments with potential neotectonic implications. These features include fracturing (faults and joints) and clastic dikes, located along the Carcavai fault.

This is suggested by a consistent strike, subparallel to the major tectonic structure, and by the location pattern. Evidences of the fault activity were also identified in the Mesozoic and Paleozoic rocks, though the age of that deformation is poorly constrained.

30|$|The Tarim Basin is {{the largest}} petroliferous basin in the {{northwest}} of China, and is composed of a Paleozoic marine craton basin and a Meso-Cenozoic continental foreland basin. It is of great significance in exploration of Ordovician. In over 50 years of exploration, oil and gas totaling over 1.6 billion tonnes oil-equivalent has been discovered in the Ordovician carbonate formation. The accumulation mechanisms and distribution rules are quite complicated because of the burial depth more than 3, 500 m, multi-source, and multi-stage accumulation, adjustment, reconstruction and re-enrichment in Ordovician. In this paper, we summarized four major advances in the hydrocarbon accumulation mechanisms of Ordovician carbonate reservoirs. First, oil came from Cambrian and Ordovician source rocks separately and as a mixture, while natural gas was mainly cracked gas generated from the Cambrian-Lower Ordovician crude oil. Second, most hydrocarbon migrated along unconformities and faults, with different directions in different regions. Third, hydrocarbon migration and accumulation had four periods: Caledonian, early Hercynian, <b>late</b> <b>Hercynian</b> and Himalayan, and the latter two {{were the most important}} for oil and gas exploration. Fourth, hydrocarbon accumulation and evolution can be generally divided into four stages: Caledonian (the period of hydrocarbon accumulation), early Hercynian (the period of destruction), <b>late</b> <b>Hercynian</b> (the period of hydrocarbon reconstruction and re-accumulation), and Himalayan (the period of hydrocarbon adjustment and re-accumulation). Source rocks (S), combinations of reservoir-seal (C), paleo-uplifts (M), structure balance belt (B) matched in the same time (T) control the hydrocarbon accumulation and distribution in the Ordovician formations. Reservoir adjustment and reconstruction can be classified into two modes of physical adjustment and variation of chemical compositions and five mechanisms. These mechanisms are occurrence displacement, biodegradation, multi-source mixing, high-temperature cracking and late gas invasion. Late hydrocarbon accumulation effects controlled the distribution of current hydrocarbon. The T-BCMS model is a basic geological model to help understanding the control of reservoirs. At present, the main problems of hydrocarbon accumulation focus on two aspects, dynamic mechanisms of hydrocarbon accumulation and the quantitative models of oil-bearing in traps, which need further systemic research.|$|E

The samples {{are representative of the}} main four types of ore: cupriferous rubane ore, rubane ore with tin, cupriferous massive sulfide ore and cupriferous massive sulfide ore with tin. The trace-element distribution among the minerals from the four ores, and particularly the high Sri and In contents as well as the Se/S values of pyrite, provide evidence of a magmatic signature for this complex and unique deposit. With respect to cassiterite, which is a characteristic major ore mineral at the Corvo deposit, both chemical composition and textural relationships to sulfides suggest that the high-temperature reduced fluids that deposited sulfides also deposited cassiterite.

Dike magmatism, similarly to {{other regions of the}} western Mediterranean, such as Sardinia, Corsica, and Catalonia, is of calc-alkaline to alkali-calcic affinity.

The dike network has a geometrical arrangement consistent with a transtensional stress regime that resulted in ductile thinning of the lower crust during the late stage of the Hercynian orogeny and concurrent fracturing of the upper crust that made possible magma ascent through dikes.

No other ore deposits than iron beds and a supergene iron-manganese karst-related deposit {{were found in the}} studied area. However, Upper Ordovician-Lower Silurian rocks show Ni, Zn, Pb content above the average values of sandstones. Upper Ordovician-Lower Silurian country rocks are grouped into two stratigraphical sequences that reflect sea-level rise-fall cycles in a basin developed in a passive margin. The duration of these cycles indicates that they were caused by a combination of eustatic processes and intraplate extensional tectonics. The <b>Late</b> <b>Hercynian</b> hydrothermal deposits hosted by metasediments and granitoids, comprise (Ba) -(Pb-Zn-Cu- [Ag]) vein and stratabound type deposits that were emplaced before the Ladinian, during an extensional stage starting in the Upper Permian. Three stages of ore deposition have been recognised, the first stage is characterised by the formation of pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, Ag sulphosalts and minor arsenopyrite and Bi sulphides. In the second stage, pyrite, Cu sulphides, barite and Ni-Co mineral s precipitated. Main deposition of galena and sphalerite took place {{at the end of the}} first stage and the beginning of the second stage. There is no evidence of selective Ag enrichment. Hydrothermal alteration of granitic host rocks is characterised by argillic-phyllic, argillic-propylitic assemblages overprinted by a late alkai metasomatism. There is a strong relation between composition of secondary minerals, mineralogy of the alteration zone and whole-rock composition. Mass transfers of alumina appear to be important. There is a significant introduction of Si, AI, K, Na, Rb and Pb, together with a depletion in Ca and Sr. Chlorite and illite geothermometers indicate temperatures of 276. 7 - 321. 5 ·C. Three events of fluid entrapment at hydrostatic pressures have been recognised, with fluids evolved from low to moderate, locally carbonaceous hot fluids to highmoderately polysaline cooler fluids.
