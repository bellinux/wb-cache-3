Before the switch to standard time zones, each local city or town was free to determine its local time, called <b>local</b> <b>mean</b> <b>time.</b> Now, Western Australia uses Western Standard Time; South Australia and the Northern Territory use Central Standard Time; while New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria, and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) use Eastern Standard Time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} definitely verified {{use of a}} differential was in a clock made by Joseph Williamson in 1720. It {{employed a}} differential to add the equation of time to <b>local</b> <b>mean</b> <b>time,</b> {{as determined by the}} clock mechanism, to produce solar time, which would have been the same as the reading of a sundial. During the 18th Century, sundials were considered to show the [...] "correct" [...] time, so an ordinary clock would frequently have to be readjusted, even if it worked perfectly, because of seasonal variations in the equation of time. Williamson's and other equation clocks showed sundial time without needing readjustment. Nowadays, we consider clocks to be [...] "correct" [...] and sundials usually incorrect, so many sundials carry instructions about how to use their readings to obtain clock time.|$|E
2500|$|Before 1883 in the United States, most {{towns and}} cities set their own local time to noon when the sun was at its highest point in the sky. Since the sun reaches [...] "high noon" [...] four minutes later for every degree of {{longitude}} traveled towards the west, the time in every town was different. [...] In Indiana, <b>local</b> <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> varied from GMT-5:39 in the east to GMT-5:52 in the west. [...] With {{the emergence of the}} railroads, hundreds of miles could be traveled in a much shorter time, causing a train passenger to apparently experience several slight changes in time over the course of even a short rail trip. By 1883, the major railroads in the US agreed to coordinate their clocks and begin operating on [...] "standard time" [...] with four [...] "time zones" [...] established across the nation, centered roughly on the 75th, 90th, 105th, and 120th meridians west. On November 18, 1883, telegraph lines transmitted GMT to major cities, where each city was to adjust their official time to their proper zone. The state capital in Indianapolis lies at approximately the 86th meridian (U.S. Census Bureau), closer {{to the center of the}} Central Time Zone at the 90th meridian than the center of the Eastern Time Zone at the 75th meridian.|$|E

50|$|<b>Local</b> <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> {{was used}} {{from the early}} 19th century, when local solar time or sundial time was last used until {{standard}} time was adopted on various dates in the several countries. Each town or city kept its own meridian. This led to a situation where locations one degree of longitude apart had times four minutes apart. This became {{a problem in the}} mid 19th century when railways needed clocks that were synchronized between stations, {{at the same time as}} people needed to match their clock (or the church clock) to the time tables. Standard time means that the same time is used throughout some region—usually, it was either offset from Greenwich Mean Time or was the <b>local</b> <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> of the capital of the region. The difference between <b>local</b> <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> and local apparent time is the equation of time.|$|E

50|$|Special {{cases of}} the {{sun-synchronous}} orbit are the noon/midnight orbit, where the <b>local</b> <b>mean</b> solar <b>time</b> of passage for equatorial longitudes is around noon or midnight, and the dawn/dusk orbit, where the <b>local</b> <b>mean</b> solar <b>time</b> of passage for equatorial longitudes is around sunrise or sunset, so that the satellite rides the terminator between day and night. Riding the terminator is useful for active radar satellites as the satellites' solar panels can always see the Sun, without being shadowed by the Earth. It is also useful for some satellites with passive instruments that need to limit the Sun's influence on the measurements, as {{it is possible to}} always point the instruments towards the night side of the Earth. The dawn/dusk orbit has been used for solar observing scientific satellites such as Yohkoh, TRACE, Hinode and PROBA2, affording them a nearly continuous view of the Sun.|$|R
50|$|When well-regulated {{mechanical}} clocks became {{widespread in}} the early 19th century, each city began to use some <b>local</b> <b>mean</b> solar <b>time.</b> Apparent and <b>mean</b> solar <b>time</b> can differ by up to around 15 minutes (as described by the equation of time) because of the elliptical shape of the Earth's orbit around the Sun (eccentricity) and the tilt of the Earth's axis (obliquity). <b>Mean</b> solar <b>time</b> has days of equal length, {{and the difference between}} the two sums to zero after a year.|$|R

50|$|For civil purposes, {{a common}} clock time is {{typically}} defined {{for an entire}} region based on the <b>local</b> <b>mean</b> solar <b>time</b> at a central meridian. Such time zones began to be adopted about {{the middle of the}} 19th century when railroads with regularly occurring schedules came into use, with most major countries having adopted them by 1929. As of 2015, throughout the world, 40 such zones are now in use: the central zone, from which all others are defined as offsets, is known as UTC±00, which uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).|$|R
50|$|Synchronization was {{important}} {{in the operation of}} 19th century railways, these being the first major means of transport fast enough for the differences in local time between adjacent towns to be noticeable. Each line handled the problem by synchronizing all its stations to headquarters as a standard railroad time. In some territories, sharing of single railroad tracks was controlled by the timetable. The need for strict timekeeping led the companies to settle on one standard, and civil authorities eventually abandoned <b>local</b> <b>mean</b> solar <b>time</b> in favor of that standard.|$|R
50|$|Except for meridians {{based on}} Greenwich, the system {{adopted by the}} {{railroad}} industry on 18 November 1883 ignored Dowd's proposal. The adopted system by William F. Allen, editor of the Traveler's Official Railway Guide, had borders that passed through railway terminals, even some in major cities, like Detroit, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and Charleston—these formed {{the border between the}} eastern and central time zones. It included a fifth time zone for eastern Canada, called Intercolonial Time after the Intercolonial Railway serving eastern Canada. Each of these boundary cities had to adopt one of the two railroad zones or continue to use <b>local</b> <b>mean</b> solar <b>time.</b> The 1918 Standard Time Act moved the borders to relatively rural areas.|$|R

40|$|Image {{binarization}} is {{the process}} of separation of pixel values into two groups, white as background and black as foreground. Thresholding plays a major in binarization of images. Thresholding can be categorized into global thresholding and local thresholding. In images with uniform contrast distribution of background and foreground like document images, global thresholding is more appropriate. In degraded document images, where considerable background noise or variation in contrast and illumination exists, there exists many pixels that cannot be easily classified as foreground or background. In such cases, binarization with local thresholding is more appropriate. This paper describes a locally adaptive thresholding technique that removes background by using <b>local</b> <b>mean</b> and mean deviation. Normally the <b>local</b> <b>mean</b> computational <b>time</b> depends on the window size. Our technique uses integral sum image as a prior processing to calculate <b>local</b> <b>mean.</b> It does not involve calculations of standard deviations as in other local adaptive techniques. This along with the fact that calculations of mean is independent of window size speed up the process as compared to other local thresholding techniques.

In 1884, the Greenwich Meridian was used for two-thirds of all charts and maps as their Prime Meridian. In 1928, the term Universal Time (UT) was introduced by the International Astronomical Union to refer to GMT, with the day starting at midnight.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a spatial domain threshold based adaptive power-law applications (TAPLA) in image enhancement technique in which adaptation {{is carried out}} with local thresholds.

This method can be applied on both the grey scale and color images. In the case of color images, each channel is considered separately.
