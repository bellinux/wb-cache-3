25|$|The {{portable}} toilet is used {{on construction}} sites, film locations, and large outdoor gatherings {{where there are no}} other facilities. They are typically self-contained units that are made to be easily moved. Most portable toilets are Unisex single units with privacy ensured by a simple lock on the door. The units are usually light weight and easily transported by a flatbed truck and loaded and unloaded by a small forklift. Many portable toilets are small molded plastic or fiberglass portable rooms with a <b>lockable</b> <b>door</b> and a receptacle to catch waste in a chemically treated container. If used {{for an extended period of}} time, they have to be cleaned out and new chemicals put in the waste receptacle. For servicing multiple portable toilets, tanker trucks (vacuum trucks or honeywagons) are equipped with large vacuums to evacuate the waste and replace the chemicals. Portable toilets can also be urine-diverting dry toilets.|$|E

50|$|The {{receiving}} vault {{was most}} commonly {{seen from the}} 1800s into the early 1900s. The earliest receiving vaults were simple underground chambers dug out of hills. Where the ground was level, the receiving vault was dug into the earth, and a mound heaped over it to mimic a hill. Receiving vaults stored coffins or bodies in loculi, or shelves, set into {{the walls of the}} vault. The interiors were simple, and often plain, with heavy <b>lockable</b> <b>doors</b> to prevent entry by grave robbers or body snatchers.|$|R

50|$|The palace was moated {{and can be}} {{separated}} into four parts: north east quadrant; the medieval barrel vault and the King's Hall, built by Henry VII in 1508, in the south east; the King’s Garden on the south west; and the Copse to the north west, once the orchard. Woking Borough Council, as custodians, have built a protective roof over the barrel vault, installed a <b>lockable</b> <b>door</b> and carried out protective repairs to the remaining Tudor wall. The King’s Garden was originally a formal kitchen garden but is now a rough meadow. The Copse contains two large linear fish ponds and a smaller round pond. The moat is on three sides whilst the River Wey enclosed the site on the fourth side.|$|E
5000|$|The word carrel {{can also}} {{refer to a}} small {{isolated}} [...] "study room" [...] in public libraries and on university campuses; usually the room has a <b>lockable</b> <b>door</b> to which the user is granted the key on request. Carrels usually contain a desk (not necessarily one described as above), shelving and a lamp. Carrels are generally quite popular at universities and are therefore usually quickly occupied. This becomes especially true during mid-term examinations and finals. They {{have the advantage of}} power for a laptop (and often internet port) as well as generally being quieter than in the main library building. Carrels are also often used as temporary storage for books and materials the user is not finished with while they are at lectures or labs.|$|E
50|$|On {{the eastern}} side, {{the main hall}} area has a half-timbered VJ wall and a fibro upper to the ceiling. The {{remainder}} of the hall is VJ lined. Two inside doors were sealed , one near the old RSL door located {{at the front of}} the building and another on the other side of the main entrance door. The stage is accessed by two wooden steps. Vertical timberwork now fronts the top of the stage, partly concealing one of the latticed air vents in the roof. A small, heavily latticed bar (formed by enclosing the rear of the addition) with a pulldown hatch and <b>lockable</b> <b>door</b> is accessed on the left prior to ascending the steps to toilet facilities at the southern end of the building.

50|$|Chemical toilets {{are large}} enough for a single occupant, usually about 110 cm square by 210 cm high. While the units are {{typically}} free-standing structures, their stability is augmented {{by the weight of}} the waste tank, which usually contains an empty liquid disinfectant dispenser and deodorizer. Some include both a seated toilet and a urinal. Most include <b>lockable</b> <b>doors,</b> ventilation near the top, and a vent pipe for the holding tank. When wind is blowing over the vent pipe it creates a low pressure area sucking the odor out. Leaving the toilet lid open will reverse the flow of the venting of the tank.|$|R

He took the charge to inforce various safety measures viz. display ‘On school duty' boards on autorickshaws, cars, mini-vans and other hired while transporting students. He also mandated maximum carriage capacity for Autorickshaws, 10 years of driving experience and an EIB driving permit for the drivers. He made it mandatory for school buses to have a fire extinguisher, first-aid box, well-fortified windows, <b>lockable</b> <b>doors</b> and emergency exits.

50|$|Bonnington Estate - The {{cast iron}} bridge here {{is presumed to}} be that built for Lady Mary Ross who {{replaced}} or adapted the dovecot which stood on Bonnington Isle, to which the bridge leads, with a 'Fog House', lined with moss. The Wordsworths visited the site in 1803 and Dorothy Wordsworth described {{the interior of the}} fog house as being 'as snug as a bird's nest' and resembling a scooped out haystack. It had a domed roof and the walls, roof and furniture were neatly covered with moss. It reminded her of huts illustrated in the book of Captain Cook's Voyages. The building had a <b>lockable</b> <b>door</b> and was reached as mentioned via a cast iron bridge that replaced an earlier wooden one. Dorothy was however far from impressed by the view from this fog house and saw it as being too close to the path frequented by visitors. She did however regard it as being the finest example of a fog house that she saw during her tour in Scotland. The fog house here no longer exists although the stone foundations are still visible and the bridge, although still present, cannot be used.|$|E
50|$|On the {{formation}} of British Railways on 1 January 1948, operators decided to produce a new range of standard coaches, instead of perpetuating existing designs—but the new types had to be compatible with the old. Two of the pre-BR companies (the GWR and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway) favoured the British Standard gangway, whereas the other two (the London and North Eastern Railway and the Southern Railway) used the Pullman type. In the design of their new Mark 1 coaches, British Railways decided to standardise on the Pullman type in view of its resistance to telescoping. These gangways consisted of a flat steel plate, having a large aperture for the passageway. At the bottom it was rivetted to the buffing plate, whilst the top was supported on the coach end by two telescopic spring units. On the coach end was a wooden doorframe; this {{was connected to the}} faceplate by a flexible diaphragm made from plasticised asbestos. When two coaches were coupled, a curtain was used to cover the inside surfaces of the diaphragms and faceplates. The doorframe was fitted with a <b>lockable</b> <b>door,</b> of either sliding or hinged type, depending on the interior layout of that end of the coach.|$|E
50|$|Re-building in {{the early}} 1990s {{involved}} the installation of train radios, PZB cab signalling, new driver's consoles, an electronic timetable system (EBuLa), and rear walls with <b>lockable</b> <b>doors</b> for the cabs. The interior was refurbished according to the then prevailing taste, the number of available seats dropped from 54 to 40. New engines of MAN type 2866 UH with 162 kW power were installed, some of the electro-mechanical gearboxes were replaced with Voith Diwa D863 hydraulic gearboxes of a type used in buses. Some driving trailers were motorised, and two powered cars that were used on the lines on Usedom island were converted to use natural gas as engine fuel.|$|R

60|$|Feeling that {{it would}} be ridiculous to inquire about mad dogs in the {{presence}} of two millions sterling, the man in grey suffered himself to be led through long passages and vaulted chambers, some of which latter were kitchens, where the men on duty had splendid fires, oceans of hot water, benches and tables, and liberty to cook the food either brought by themselves for the day or procured from a caterer on the premises-- for Post-Office officials when on duty may not leave the premises for any purpose whatever, except duty, and must sign books specifying to the minute when, where, and why, they come and go. In this basement also, as in the other, were long rows of numbered cupboards or large pigeon-holes with <b>lockable</b> <b>doors,</b> one of which was appropriated to each man for the safe depositing of his victuals and other private property.|$|R
30|$|The toolkit {{introduction}} {{was also}} observed to increase dialog around {{the need for}} improved sanitation infrastructure. For example, following the initial workshop, one WASH NGO requested technical support to address MHM-friendly sanitation facilities under construction at three schools in Nyarugusu camp. This led to joint assessments by the NGO and toolkit team to evaluate the proposed design based on toolkit standards and propose feasible corrective actions, such as ensuring locks and tighter doorframes, improved drainage mechanisms for washrooms to enhance privacy, and clearer delineation (and spacing) {{between male and female}} facilities. The same NGO subsequently introduced minor modifications (i.e., <b>lockable</b> <b>doors)</b> within toilet and bathing facilities at protection centers, other schools, and at the border points. For toilet facilities located at the household level, there remained a lack of improvements to toilet infrastructure subsequent to the toolkit introduction, including that communal facilities (toilets shared by multiple families) were deemed as not private, safe, hygienic, or comfortable locations for managing menstruation, especially at night.|$|R

50|$|In the trial, Escamilla's defence {{argued that}} he had taken the rifle in the belief that Leavitt was likely to be violent when confronted; that Lightsey was himself acting worryingly when he asked to be given the rifle; and that the rifle was {{defective}} and could have gone off accidentally. A weapons expert testified in support of the last point, and the defence called five character witnesses from his home in California to testify to his peaceful and non-violent nature. However, only one was able to testify. The defence also argued that the jury should be instructed to consider the special conditions which were present on T-3 - for example, the lack of law enforcement and the absence of <b>lockable</b> <b>doors</b> - and how they might affect what constituted negligent conduct. The judge refused to make such a direction. The jury found Escamilla not guilty of second-degree murder on the high seas, but did find him guilty of the lesser offence of involuntary manslaughter on the high seas. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment, but bailed pending the outcome of an appeal.|$|R
50|$|From 1984 to 1986, trim {{levels were}} L(standard), GL (deluxe), and GLS (glorious). The L {{featured}} vinyl seats, a fold-down rear bench seat, and usually a four-speed manual transmission mated to a 1.4 L I4 engine. The GL included vinyl-cloth seats, a standard clock (which was {{mounted in the}} instrument cluster) rear wiper, passenger-side mirror, tinted glass, <b>lockable</b> fuel <b>door,</b> standard door guards, upgraded interior trim, and (from 1985) an available 1.6 L engine.

40|$|Health risks {{associated}} with poor sanitation behaviours continue to be reported mostly from low-income countries (LICs). Reports show that various factors limit many people from accessing and using improved latrines, forcing some to opt for sharing latrines with neighbours, others practicing open defecation. Meanwhile, debate prevails on whether shared latrines should be categorised as unimproved according to WHO/UNICEF-JMP criteria. We contribute to this debate based on results from a study undertaken in three regions, Tanzania. Data were collected through observations in 1, 751 households with latrines, coupled with collection of opinions from heads of such households regarding the latrine-sharing practices. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess associations between the outcome and possible predictor variables. Of all 1, 751 latrines, 14. 6 % were shared. Among the shared latrines, 74. 2 % were found being generally clean as compared to 69. 2 % of the non-shared ones. Comparing the shared and non-shared latrines, the non-shared latrines were {{significantly less likely to}} be found with floors built with permanent materials (OR = 0. 73, 95 % CI: 0. 55, 0. 98); washable floors (OR = 0. 69; 95 % CI: 0. 51, 0. 93); and <b>lockable</b> <b>doors</b> (OR = 0. 73; 95 % CI: 0. 56, 0. 95). Shared latrines were less likely to have floors with faecal matter, functional handwashing facilities (HWFs), HWFs with running water, and roofs; albeit the differences in all these scenarios were not statistically significant. Respondents expressed desire for improved latrines, but also did not find it wrong to share latrines if cleanliness was maintained. Having an 'improved' latrine remains important as JMP recommends, but based on our study findings, we argue that possessing a non-shared latrine neither guarantees safety to its users nor its categorisation as 'improved'. Instead, the state of the latrine, the construction technology used and the behaviours of the users may be more important...|$|R

50|$|In June 1997, during {{excavation}} {{work for a}} new barn west of Breitenheim, there was an utterly unexpected discovery when some foundation remnants of an obviously very old building were unearthed. Thanks to builder Wolff’s thoughtfulness and interest in history, knowledge of this find reached the state archaeologists in Mainz who were responsible for such things by way of Karen Groß of the Meisenheim Historical Club. During a promptly undertaken survey of the village, the ruin was recognized as Roman and {{it was decided to}} undertake an immediate dig. This was, however, only possible with the family Wolff’s and Mrs. Groß’s courtesy and support once again. Over a fortnight, a team from the Archäologische Landesdenkmalpflege (State Archaeological Monument Care), Mainz office, sometimes thwarted by rain, dug the building’s remnants up. Under local excavation engineer Klaus Soukop’s leadership, six young men, most doing alternative civilian service but one a “freelancer”, pealed back the layers of earth to bring the old foundations to light. A whole variety of equipment was deployed, everything from a compact excavator to a trowel. The goal was to make every trace of the building visible {{to learn as much as}} could be learnt about its size, possible conversions, the rooms’ functions and the building technique. In the next step of the work, the whole site was photographed, drawn to scale and described - requirements for scientific analysis. After one week came the careful burial work - the site was not left exposed - so that as planned, the barn could be built. In the coming years - with the family Wolff’s permission - the further parts of the building are to be unearthed, which will make Breitenheim the only place within a great distance to have the footprint of a Roman villa rustica that has been so completely excavated. Hitherto, only a few carved stones with ornamental and figural decoration, set into the walls at Breitenheim’s church, had made it clear that what is now Breitenheim was settled even as far back as Roman times. As parts of old tombs, these stones also indirectly bear witness to a villa rustica. In 1997, this was finally found, between the Jeckenbach and the Bollerbübchen. A Roman villa rustica - Latin for “country estate” - was made up of a main building, which was the dwelling, and several outbuildings, namely a barn, a stable, a shed, servants’ quarters and so on. Such estates are known to have lain within very nearly every municipality in the district of Bad Kreuznach and neighbouring regions. Back in Roman times, villages, as the word is understood now, did not yet exist. Beginning in the 1st century AD, sometimes together with native Celtic timber-frame buildings, these country estates characterized the land for four centuries. Agricultural goods were produced here not only for the occupants’ own needs, but also for the main towns in the region, towns now called Bad Kreuznach, Alzey, Bingen, Mainz, Worms and Trier, among others. Rising from stone foundations were plastered stone and timber-frame buildings with several floors, tiled roofs and glazed windows. Inside were frescoed floors, sometimes mosaics, a hypocaust, painted walls and wooden-beam or vaulted ceilings, sometimes stuccoed. <b>Lockable</b> wooden <b>doors</b> inside and leading outside afforded access to the rooms and joined them together. The façade was often impressively shaped with a colonnade over the entrance. A heated bathing facility was part of a villa rustica’s basic appointments as surely as running water from the nearest spring. Removed somewhat from the main building but still within sight lay the private graveyard with gravestones or even optically pleasing grave monuments. The villa rustica was always linked to the well developed road network, and the next villa rustica along the road often lay only about a kilometre away. Discharged soldiers lived here, but mainly it was the newly wealthy native Celtic populace, who gladly adopted the Roman way of life and the things that Roman civilization had to offer. By the 4th century, though, or at the latest the 5th, this era of high living ended, and the Middle Ages announced their onset with the waves of migration that involved so much of Europe. The local area was then characterized more by Germanic peoples such as the Alemanni and the Franks.|$|R
