5|$|At TNA's {{previous}} No Surrender PPV {{event on}} September14, Sting announced that TNA management {{had decided that}} he would challenge the TNA World Heavyweight Champion for the title at Bound for Glory. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> Joe defeated Christian Cage and Angle in a Three Ways to Glory match to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after Jarrett interfered in the bout by bashing a guitar over Angle's head. Following No Surrender on the September18 episode of Impact!, Sting discussed his actions further, stating that when he was younger he learned from the veterans in the industry and that Joe and Styles had been disrespectful in their rivalries with Booker T and Angle. Jarrett responded to Sting's comments <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> stating that the issue was not about disrespect, it was about the veterans in the company not wanting to retire and let the younger wrestlers be stars. Angle argued that he made TNA a success, not the efforts of Jarrett, Sting, Joe, or Styles. Angle then challenged Jarrett to a match at Bound for Glory IV, which Jarrett declined. On the September25 episode of Impact!, Angle challenged Jarrett to a match again, this time threatening and mocking him along with his daughters. Jarrett accepted Angle's challenge afterwards. Sting also expressed his reasons for having a desire to face Joe for the title on the same telecast, stating that he was taught respect by veterans in his youth so he was going to defeat Joe for the championship at Bound for Glory to teach Joe respect. Mick Foley was announced as the Special Ringside Enforcer for the Jarrett versus Angle bout on the October2 Impact! episode. Sting and Joe signed the contract for their encounter on the October9 episode of Impact!, with the stipulation added {{that there would be no}} rematch between the two after the event regardless of the outcome.|$|E
5|$|The main feud on the ECW brand {{involved}} CM Punk and his ECW Championship. Punk {{had just}} retained his title against Big Daddy V at No Mercy, the previous pay-per-view. John Morrison, whom Punk defeated for the title, returned on the October 9 episode of ECW, {{after a brief}} absence, and defeated Punk in a non-title match. The Cyber Sunday match was then made to be CM Punk defending the ECW Championship against the fans' choice between Big Daddy V, Morrison, and The Miz. The next week on ECW, Punk, along with Kane, defeated his three possible opponents in a 3-on-2 Handicap match. Morrison and The Miz (who were a tag team) turned on each other, and they faced {{each other in a}} match <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> which was interrupted by Big Daddy V. On the October 23 episode of ECW, Big Daddy V faced Kane, and Punk teamed with Balls Mahoney to face The Miz and Morrison in a tag team match. Punk and Mahoney won due to a miscommunication between The Miz and Morrison.|$|E
5|$|Monster's Ball II {{was held}} at Bound for Glory. Rhino, Abyss, Sabu, and Jeff Hardy all participated in the match. James Mitchell {{accompanied}} Abyss to the ring. In a Monster's Ball match, pinfalls and submissions count anywhere. There are no disqualifications or count-outs and weapons are supplied and welcomed. It is called Monster's Ball because in the storyline each wrestler has supposedly been locked {{in a dark room}} for the preceding 24 hours without food or water. In the very beginning, Sabu started bleeding from his right eye, while Hardy had blood coming out of a cut on his arm. Midway through the bout, Rhino also started to bleed. Hardy laid Abyss on a table and then ascended {{to the top of the}} Bound for Glory set. He then jumped off in a somersault and landed on Abyss. Eventually both Abyss and Hardy recovered, leading to Rhino tackling Abyss through a table with his signature Gore maneuver. Afterwards, Rhino drove Hardy's head into the mat with his signature Rhino Driver maneuver from the second ring rope and followed with a pin to win the match at 12 minutes and 20 seconds. After this match, Larry Zbyszko announced that a Ten-Man Gauntlet match would be held <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> to determine who would face Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
2500|$|Cassandra Trotter (Gwyneth Strong) — Cassandra {{first met}} Rodney in [...] "Yuppy Love". Their {{relationship}} blossomed, {{and by the}} end of series six the two had married. But her high career ambitions caused conflict with Rodney, and their troubled marriage was one of <b>the</b> main storylines <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> run.|$|R
50|$|For many years, rumors {{circulated}} that Bill Cullen replaced James <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> run; however, {{only one}} source has ever stated this (Alex McNeill's Total Television) {{and the existence}} of an episode taped October 3, 1968 with James as host has effectively debunked this. Further, Cullen was at <b>the</b> time based <b>in</b> New York City, while PDQ was taped in Hollywood.|$|R
50|$|After FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper {{comes to}} Twin Peaks to {{investigate}} the murder of Laura Palmer, MIKE appears to Cooper in a dream, explaining his and BOB's history, {{but in a way}} that is not immediately clear. He shows Cooper a vision of BOB as he appeared <b>in</b> life. <b>Later,</b> Cooper, Deputy Hawk, and Sheriff Truman locate Philip Gerard, who is at the time unable to give them any information. <b>Later,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> second season, MIKE is key to solving Laura Palmer's murder.|$|R
5|$|The Brothers {{took part}} in the {{gauntlet}} match at Glory By Honor 2, which was held to fill the tag team championship left vacant by Red suffering a serious knee injury. They defeated and eliminated the Special K team of Hydro and Angeldust as well as The Ring Crew Express, before being eliminated by the other Special K team in the match, Izzy and Dixie, due to outside interference from Angeldust. After Izzy and Dixie later won the tag team title, the Brothers were granted a shot at it, at Main Event Spectacles. The reason given in the storyline was they were given the shot since they only lost in the gauntlet match because Special K cheated. In the opening segment of that event, they were aligned with Jim Cornette, because, in the storyline, Cornette wanted to create new champions. They attacked his former client, Samoa Joe, who Cornette abandoned since he already was a champion. They {{went on to win the}} belts <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> At The Conclusion, The Battle Lines Are Drawn, and The Last Stand, which was by stipulation Joe's last shot at the tag team title for as long as the Briscoe Brothers held it, they retained the belts over Joe and a different partner each time, A.J. Styles, Bryan Danielson, and Jerry Lynn respectively. Since Joe took pinfalls at The Conclusion (to Mark) and The Last Stand (to Jay), both brothers subsequently earned shots at his world title. Both fell; Mark at Final Battle 2003 and Jay at At Our Best in a memorable and bloody steel cage match.|$|E
25|$|On October 18, 2007 {{edition of}} Impact!, Gilbertti {{appeared}} in a taped interview segment with Mike Tenay as Disco Inferno. He returned <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> losing in a squash match to Abyss.|$|E
25|$|Television {{shows such}} as Urban Legends, , and later , feature re-enactments of urban legends {{detailing}} the accounts of the tales and (typically) <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> these programs reveal any factual basis they may have. The Discovery Channel TV show MythBusters (2003–2016) tried to prove or disprove urban legends by attempting to reproduce them using the scientific method.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>show</b> {{was unique}} {{for its use}} of the Vietnam War. Before All My Children debuted, no <b>show</b> had {{discussed}} <b>the</b> war <b>in</b> any depth. There were traditional Phoebe and free-spirited Amy both butting heads over the war, with Amy often leading protests around Pine Valley. When Amy left, Ruth takes over as the anti-war voice and protests against <b>the</b> war <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1970s. The character's protest speech in 1972 won Mary Fickett the first Emmy Award given to a soap opera performer. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> run, Phoebe softened.|$|R
500|$|As part of {{the larger}} story, the writers have placed {{elements}} in earlier episodes that are referenced <b>in</b> episodes seasons <b>later.</b> For example, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first-season episode [...] "The Ghost Network", the Fringe team encounters an amber-like substance, which is later shown to be a critical means to combat the breakdown of the parallel universe and eventually for <b>the</b> same <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prime universe with the third-season episode [...] "6B". Pinkner compared this aspect to [...] "planting seeds", some which they know how they plan to use <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> story, while others they can find ways of incorporating into these later episodes.|$|R
50|$|Harold's {{advanced}} {{knowledge of}} computers, television and technology originally landed him {{the job of}} producer and director of <b>the</b> TV <b>show,</b> often wielding a portable device with dials and a keyboard, used to create <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> visual effects and transitions, though he didn't have it <b>in</b> <b>later</b> seasons. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> history, he became employed at Multicorp {{and went to work}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighbouring town of Port Asbestos. He later became the publicity manager for Possum Lake, and eventually fell in love with Bonnie (Laurie Elliott), a commercial truck driver who shares nearly all of his unusual mannerisms. The two were married <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final episode of the series.|$|R
25|$|In 1964, Walt Disney was a guest, {{primarily}} {{to promote his}} production of Mary Poppins. Benny persuaded Disney to give him over 110 free admission tickets to Disneyland for his friends and one for his wife, but <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> Disney apparently sent his pet tiger after Benny as revenge, at which point Benny opened his umbrella and soared above the stage like Mary Poppins.|$|E
25|$|The cast of {{the show}} mainly {{contains}} Srujan Lokesh, Indrajith Lankesh, Shwetha Chengappa, Aparna, Mimicry Dayanand and V Manohar with permanent characters. Pavan Kumar, Rajashekhar and many other artists have no fixed character and play different characters as per the scripts. Mandya Ramesh, Kuri Prathap and Naveen Padil {{were added to the}} main cast <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> with permanent characters. Recurring cast with fixed characters include Vandana Dayanand and Rajini. The table below briefs about the cast and characters in detail.|$|E
25|$|At WrestleMania XXX in March, Hogan {{served as}} the host, coming out {{at the start of}} the show to hype up the crowd. During his promo, he mistakenly {{referred}} to the Superdome, the venue the event was being held at, as the Silverdome, which became the subject of jokes throughout the night. Hogan was later joined by Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock, and they finished their promo by drinking beer together in the ring. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> Hogan shared a moment with Mr. T, Paul Orndorff and Roddy Piper, with whom he main evented the first WrestleMania.|$|E
50|$|Despite its {{popularity}} {{as a family}} drama, American Dreams was heavily criticized for its various levels of historical inaccuracy. Several historic events were restaged earlier or <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> timeline to fit a plotline, {{and some of the}} music and pop culture references do not match up with either historic fact or <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> current timeline. Several arguments between <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> loyal fanbase can be traced to whether <b>the</b> <b>show</b> should be viewed as a chronologically accurate representation of life in 1960s Philadelphia, or is instead an idealized combination of mnemonic images and pop culture references from points throughout the 1960s, much as the film The Wedding Singer was for the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|During {{the run of}} {{the series}} Hasham {{released}} a pop-music album, although {{he was not able to}} successfully launch a career as a singer. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> run a spin-off series focusing on Hasham's character switching to a career as a private investigator also failed to pan-out. After Number 96 ended Hasham continued his career with acting roles where he was part of a television series ensemble. Probably his most widely seen post-Number 96 acting performance in Australia was an ongoing role as villain, Ken Hansen, <b>in</b> soap opera <b>The</b> Young Doctors <b>in</b> 1979. Through <b>the</b> early 1980s he presented a series of television advertisements for a television rental company called Electronic Sales and Rentals.|$|R
50|$|Barry was <b>later</b> {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quiz <b>show</b> scandals, and in 1958 {{testified before}} {{a congressional committee}} about his involvement.|$|R
25|$|Two {{incidents}} {{occurred at}} the tour's second stop at the PNE Coliseum on March 2, 1999 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. After Manson made a lewd remark about Love during his band's performance, Love ran onstage, hiked her dress and jumped on Manson's back while he sang. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> Manson suffered from dizziness and fainted onstage, injuring his hand on a monitor as he fell. Initially he pretended {{it was part of}} the show, but left the stage after performing their signature song to seek medical attention. When he returned onstage, he pulled the plugs off of their instrument amplifiers and stormed offstage without performing an encore. The rest of the band left the stage afterward.|$|E
25|$|News, {{sport and}} {{detailed}} weather reports were presented on the half-hour. As of 6 August 2012 either Henry or Robinson also presented news headlines on the quarter-hour. In addition Metropolitan viewers also received regular traffic updates for their respective city from SUNA traffic. Until 3 August 2012 after the 8:30am news, the hosts crossed to Yumi Stynes, Gorgi Coghlan or another Circle guest host {{to find out}} what was coming up on The Circle. The hosts were joined by Wendell Sailor and Roger Oldridge respectively to preview and review NRL and AFL matches Monday and Friday mornings at 6:40am during the respective seasons. Viewers were able to express their views by phoning the Henry Hotline, a talkback radio style segment; these calls were replayed <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b>|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Anderson {{had begun}} a new feud. She did not {{participate}} in the tournament at ChickFight VIII but instead had a rematch against Eden Black for the newly created Transatlantic Women's Championship, which she won. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> she successfully defended the title against Croatian wrestler Wesna Busic. The two had met years previously when her internet celebrity saw her invited to German Stampede Wrestling to face Wesna in a losing effort at International Impact I. After defending her Transatlantic Championship at ChickFight VII, their next CF meeting saw Wesna defend her RQW Women's Championship fought under ChickFight Rules (no disqualification and falls count anywhere) which saw the two go to a forty-five-minute time limit draw. This left the two at 1–1 and so a decisive match was to be held at ChickFight X but this ended in controversy when Wesna claimed that her tap out was merely an attempt to grab the rope for a rope break; their rematch later that night saw Wesna pick up the victory leaving them drawn again at 2–2. CF XI was originally slated to be a two out of three falls match to find a decisive victory until Anderson pulled out due to injury.|$|E
500|$|After {{the series}} had been conceived, Newman {{initially}} approached Don Taylor and then Shaun Sutton to produce it, although both declined. He then decided on his former production assistant at ABC, Verity Lambert, {{who had never}} produced, written or directed, but she readily accepted his offer. As Lambert became the youngest—and only female—drama producer at the BBC, there were some doubts as to Newman's choice, but she became a success <b>in</b> <b>the</b> role. Even Newman clashed with her on occasion, however, particularly over {{the inclusion of the}} alien Dalek creatures on the programme. Newman had not wanted any [...] "bug-eyed monsters" [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> but he was placated when the creatures became a great success. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> run, <b>in</b> 1966 he took a more hands-on role again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> changeover between the First and Second Doctors.|$|R
50|$|Before {{taking the}} role as Beth Hunter on Home And Away, Clarissa previouly played {{a small part}} as a council worker named Ms Angelo. Ironically she {{was a friend of}} Shelley Sutherland whose husband married her {{character}} Beth Hunter <b>later</b> on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> Clarissa has now joined All Saints, playing Julia Mayfair, Frank's carer.|$|R
50|$|Taylor is a 16 {{year old}} girl living in Edendale, Louisiana. She {{is very much}} the 'popular socialite' of this show. She forms an intense {{relationship}} with Drake, despite the fact that Sophia is interested in her, and ends up pregnant <b>later</b> on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> She is close friends with Emery, Lukas, Julia, Grayson, and Roman.|$|R
25|$|In the {{following}} match, Jeff Jarrett (accompanied by the Roadie) defended his Intercontinental Championship against Shawn Michaels. The match first {{went back and}} forth, with both Michaels and Jarrett taking control for certain periods. The first highspot occurred when Jarrett backdropped Michaels over the top rope to the arena floor. Throughout the match, the Roadie distracted the referee, allowing Jarrett to perform illegal tactics to gain an advantage. Michaels managed to escape a sleeper hold minutes later, gaining {{the upper hand in}} the process. After several highspot moves by Michaels, The Roadie shook the ring-ropes while Michaels was on the top rope, grounding Michaels in the process. Jarrett attempted to regain the advantage by performing the Figure four leglock, but Michaels reversed the hold into a near-fall. Jarrett went for the submission hold again, but Michaels shoved him into the referee, sending the official to the ground. Michaels tried to seize the advantage with a Superkick, but the Roadie grabbed Michaels. Jarrett performed a Crossbody, getting a near-fall in the process. The finish to the match came when the Roadie accidentally tripped Jarrett. Jarrett got back up only to walk into Michaels's Superkick. Michaels pinned him and became Intercontinental Champion. It was revealed <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> that Jarrett and The Roadie were involved in a backstage confrontation with each other, signaling an end to their on-screen friendship.|$|E
25|$|Foley {{appeared}} on Raw on the January 16, 2012, episode {{to announce his}} intentions {{to participate in the}} Royal Rumble match at the 2012 Royal Rumble pay-per-view later in the night during a six-man tag team match CM Punk needing a tag Foley came down to the ring and got tagged in the match; he defeated David Otunga but John Laurinaitis reversed the decision because Foley was not an official participant of the match. The next week, he also appeared, wishing Zack Ryder good luck in his match against Kane that night. Foley participated in the Royal Rumble match at the 2012 Royal Rumble pay-per-view where he entered at number 7 and eliminated Justin Gabriel (with the help of Ricardo Rodriguez), Epico, and Primo, eventually being eliminated by Cody Rhodes after 06:34 this was Foley's last night as an active wrestler. Foley later appeared in a segment alongside Santino Marella during Wrestlemania XXVIII. On April 10, 2012, Foley made an appearance on WWE SmackDown: Blast from the Past. He returned to Raw on June 18, 2012, announcing that he would be serving as the temporary general manager of both Raw and SmackDown for the week. On July 23, at the 1000th episode of Raw, he appeared as Dude Love, danced with Brodus Clay and performed the mandible claw on Jack Swagger with a tie dyed Mr. Socko. In 2012 he hosted the WWE: Falls Count Anywhere – The Greatest Street Fights and other Out of Control Matches DVD. On the September 24, 2012 episode of Raw, Foley made an appearance to confront CM Punk, telling him to accept a match against John Cena. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> however, Punk attacked Foley backstage. At Hell in a Cell, CM Punk successfully retained his WWE Championship against Ryback due to interference from the referee, Brad Maddox. The next day on Raw, CM Punk announced he would be facing Team Foley at Survivor Series in a traditional Survivor Series Tag Team Elimination match for which Foley had accepted the challenge. However Punk had been removed from the match the following week. On the November 12, 2012 episode of Raw, Foley was appointed the Special Guest Enforcer in the match between CM Punk and John Cena. Foley's hand-picked Survivor Series team of The Miz, Randy Orton, Kofi Kingston and Team Hell No failed to defeat Team Ziggler in the Traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series Elimination Tag Match. Foley portrayed Santa Claus on the December 24 pre-taped edition of Monday Night Raw. Foley as Santa was run over by Alberto Del Rio. However, he managed to recover later in the night and help Cena defeat Del Rio in a Miracle on 34th Street Fight.|$|E

500|$|Bowie {{entered the}} show to the song [...] "Glass Spider", {{for which he was}} lowered from the set's ceiling while seated in a silver chair and singing into a telephone. Bowie was dressed in a single-breasted three-quarters length red suit, a red shirt, and red shoes. The show's first {{vignette}} began with [...] "Bang Bang", during which Bowie pulled an audience member out of the crowd, only to be rejected by the fan, who {{by the end of the}} song was revealed to be one of the troupe's dancers. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> for the song [...] "Fashion", the dance troupe threatened Bowie with a street fight, which, by the end of the song, he accidentally wins.

500|$|In May 1976, {{at the age}} of 17, Eaton {{made his}} debut in NWA Mid-America. He entered his first match, a loss to Bearcat Wright, as a last-minute {{substitute}} for Wright's absent opponent. He quickly became a regular in Mid-America and continued to train with the more experienced wrestlers. Before long, fans, as well as promoter Nick Gulas, noticed Eaton's athleticism and showmanship. [...] Gulas decided to [...] "promote" [...] Eaton up the ranks of NWA Mid-America, giving him matches <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> closer to the main event. The angle that really helped elevate Eaton's name up the card in the promotion took place after the introduction of the tag team The Hollywood Blonds (Jerry Brown and Buddy Roberts). Eaton fought the Blonds with a variety of partners, including his old trainer Yamamoto and [...] "Pistol" [...] Pez Whatley. When the Blonds decided to move to a different wrestling promotion, the storyline maintained that Eaton was responsible for driving them out of NWA Mid-America.|$|E
500|$|Free {{from his}} EMI {{contract}} on 9 May 1972, Barrett signed {{a document that}} ended his association with Pink Floyd, and any financial interest in future recordings. Barrett attended an informal jazz and poetry performance by Pete Brown and former Cream bassist Jack Bruce in October 1973. Brown arrived at the show late, and saw that Bruce was already onstage, along with [...] "a guitarist I vaguely recognised", playing the Horace Silver tune [...] "Doodlin'". <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> Brown read out a poem, which he dedicated to Syd, because, [...] "he's here in Cambridge, and he's {{one of the best}} songwriters in the country" [...] when, to his surprise, the guitar player from earlier in the show stood up and said, [...] "No I'm not". By the end of 1973, Barrett had returned to live in London, staying at various hotels and, in December of that year, settling in at Chelsea Cloisters. He had little contact with others, apart from his regular visits to his management's offices to collect his royalties, and the occasional visit from his sister Rosemary.|$|E
