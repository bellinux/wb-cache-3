There was nothing but that wretched, old, mangled {{steamboat}} I was leaning against, while he talked fluently about 'the necessity for every man to get on.' 'And when one comes out here, you conceive, {{it is not to}} gaze at the moon.' Mr. Kurtz was a 'universal genius,' but even a genius would find it easier to work with 'adequate tools--intelligent men.' He did not make bricks--why, there was a physical impossibility in the way--as I was well aware; and if he did secretarial work for the manager, it was because 'no sensible man rejects wantonly the confidence of his superiors.' Did I see it? I saw it. What more did I want? What I really wanted was rivets, by heaven! Rivets. To get on with the work--to stop the hole. Rivets I wanted. There were cases of them down at the coast--cases--piled up--burst--split! You kicked a <b>loose</b> <b>rivet</b> at every second step in that station yard on the hillside. Rivets had rolled into the grove of death. You could fill your pockets with rivets for the trouble of stooping down--and there wasn't one rivet to be found where it was wanted. We had plates that would do, but nothing to fasten them with. And every week the messenger, a lone negro, letter-bag on shoulder and staff in hand, left our station for the coast. And several times a week a coast caravan came in with trade goods,--ghastly glazed calico that made you shudder only to look at it, glass beads value about a penny a quart, confounded spotted cotton handkerchiefs. And no rivets. Three carriers could have brought all that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat.|$|E
5000|$|A hammer is {{also used}} to [...] "ring" [...] an {{installed}} rivet, as a non-destructive test for tightness and imperfections. The inspector taps the head (usually the factory head) of the rivet with the hammer while touching the rivet and base plate lightly with the other hand and judges the quality of the audibly returned sound and the feel of the sound traveling through the metal to the operator's fingers. A rivet tightly set in its hole returns a clean and clear ring, while a <b>loose</b> <b>rivet</b> produces a recognizably different sound.|$|E

A sudden dip in the bow caused the submarine to be swamped through the hatch in the conning tower. She was salvaged four days after the accident at which point a <b>loose</b> <b>rivet</b> was found in the bow plating. The submarine was then repaired and recommissioned and used for training during the First World War along with A9 as part of the First Submarine Flotilla, operating near Devonport through early 1916. She was scrapped in October 1920 at Dartmouth.|$|E

To move, the robot uses a flexible network of pneumatic suction cups that are adjustable to the surface. It can inspect the lines of rivets with ultrasonic waves, eddy current and thermographic techniques. It detects <b>loose</b> <b>rivets</b> and cracks.|$|R

This procedure can be performed for every rivet type and considering different technological parameters and actual assembly conditions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A wavelet-based active sensing {{technique}} for health monitoring of isotropic thin plate-like structures using baseline-free ultrasonic guided Lamb wave signals is presented. In this technique, a built in clock-like piezoelectric (PZT) wafer array of small footprint comprising {{of a single}} transmitter and multi-receivers (STMR) is considered. The recorded signals in absence of defects are compared with a theoretical model first, and the velocity and amplitude dispersion of guided waves are studied {{in an effort to}} tune an appropriate guided wave mode. A five cycle Hanning pulse is transmitted, and the pulse-echo data recorded at the receivers is processed using two novel algorithms, namely damage index 1 (DI 1) and damage index 2 (DI 2), based on wavelet transformation to identify defects in the form of cracks and <b>loose</b> <b>rivet</b> holes, which are located both near and far away from the array. In both cases, damage index (DI) maps are generated for identification of defects in a particular coverage area on demand by considering the reflected fundamental guided wave modes. Simulation studies are als...|$|E
40|$|A damage index (DI) {{approach}} for damage detection and localization based on {{high frequency wave}} propagation data and low frequency vibration measurements is presented. Improved ultrasonic and vibration test setups, consisting of either distributed high-fidelity piezoelectric sensor arrays or laser vibrometer, data acquisition boards, signal conditioning and dedicated software have been implemented. In the wave propagation measurements, the data consist of broadband signals due to ultrasonic waves propagating in the structure, while in the vibration measurements they are modal response of the structure produced by the actuators. Using the initial measurements performed on an undamaged structure as baseline, damage indices are evaluated from the comparison of the frequency response of the monitored structure with an unknown damage. In case of wave propagation measurements, a damaged/undamaged path mechanism is used to approximately locate the damage using the correlations obtained between the statistical DI (statistic t) values at the sensor locations (control points). For vibration measurements, both piezoelectric patches and the laser vibrometer are used as response sensors {{in an effort to}} examine their sensitivity to damage detection. It is found that the laser vibrometer acquisitions produce improved sensitivity and higher accuracy of the DI when compared to piezo-patches as response sensors. In addition, Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) has been used to compare and quantify the changes in the modal parameters evaluated from the measurements carried out on the healthy and damaged structure. The DI approach is used to identify various types of defects in the form of <b>loose</b> <b>rivet</b> holes, delaminations due to low velocity impact and added mass for changes in the stiffness, in both metallic and composite structural components with relatively complex geometries. It is shown that the procedure is able to identify an emerging and/or growing defect, with some degree of confidence. (C) 200...|$|E

5000|$|Tape {{measures}} that were {{intended for use}} in tailoring or dressmaking were made from flexible cloth or plastic. They are named [...] "sewing tape". These types of tape measures were mainly used for the measuring of the human's waist line. Today, measuring tapes made for sewing are made of fiberglass, which does not tear or stretch as easily. Measuring tapes designed for carpentry or construction often use a stiff, curved metallic ribbon that can remain stiff and straight when extended, but retracts into a coil for convenient storage. This type of tape measure will have a floating tang or hook on the end to aid measuring. The tang {{is connected to the}} tape with <b>loose</b> <b>rivets</b> through oval holes, and can move a distance equal to its thickness, to provide both inside and outside measurements that are accurate. [...] A tape measure of 25 or even 100 feet can wind into a relatively small container. The self-marking tape measure allows the user an accurate one hand measure.|$|R
5|$|At {{least one}} other AJ-2 was {{purchased}} and used as a water bomber before it was purchased in 1970 by Avco Lycoming for use as an engine testbed for the YF102 turbofan. The J33 turbojet had to be reinstalled and the aircraft required almost a year of maintenance {{before it could be}} flown to Avco Lycoming's home airfield at Stratford, Connecticut. The YF102, too fat to fully fit in the bomb bay, was mounted on a retractable mechanism that could be lowered below the aircraft for tests. The testing was conducted from January to July 1972. Another round of testing on the commercial derivative of the F102, the ALF 502, was performed between January 1979 and December 1980. In 1984, routine maintenance discovered several <b>loose</b> <b>rivets</b> on the spar and further examination showed that the skin was starting to separate from the spar. This damage was too uneconomical to repair so Avco Lycoming decided to donate the last surviving Savage to the National Museum of Naval Aviation. The AJ-2 was flown to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida on 9 May 1984.|$|R
40|$|December 2006. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 62 - 64) This thesis {{presents a}} study of the effect of controllable riveting parameters, mainly squeeze force, rivet length, rivet diameter tolerance, hole countersunk depth and hole diameter tolerance, on the quality of formed rivet. The quality of a formed rivet is determined by the geometry of its head formation {{and the extent to which}} the hole is filled. The study determines maximum allowable tolerance on drilled hole in a 0. 064 ” thick aluminum sheet for a 1 / 8 ” rivet. The study is performed using finite element simulation of the riveting process. Theoretical relations between squeeze force and formed rivet head geometry derived in this study is used to validate the finite element model. Statistical design of experiment is employed to analyze the simulation data of riveting and determine the effect of individual factors, their interactions and relationship with the quality of formed rivet head. The results demonstrate that the correct formation of rivet head geometry depends upon all the factors studied. However, correct geometry of rivet head is not enough to determine the quality of a riveted joint, because the countersunk rivet head does not expand enough to fill up the hole completely, thereby creating a gap and leading to a <b>loose</b> <b>rivet.</b> The gap increases with the increase in tolerances in drilled hole, limiting its allowable tolerances to 0. 006 ”. The length of rivet has no significant effect on the gap formation. To ensure the elimination of gap formation, an alternate procedure with reduced countersunk depth is studied, which allows for increased allowable tolerance in drilled hole. Results show that with as little as 0. 01 ” reduced countersunk depth, the allowable tolerances on drilled hole could be increased to 0. 03 ”, without compromising on the quality of the joint...|$|E

2500|$|From 1938 to 1941, London {{received}} an altogether more comprehensive modernisation. Her upperworks were removed {{and replaced by}} new fore and aft superstructures and two upright funnels modelled on the contemporary [...] cruisers. The forward superstructure block incorporated a large hangar opening onto an athwartships catapult between the superstructure blocks. There was a catapult {{on either side of}} the after funnel. The 4-inch anti-aircraft guns were replaced by twin mountings and relocated to the after superstructure, with the torpedoes a deck below. The 2-pounder guns were carried on the hangar roof and the multiple Vickers guns mounted, one each, on the roofs of [...] "B" [...] and [...] "X" [...] turrets. A [...] belt, [...] deep, was added abreast the machinery spaces, extending up to the armoured deck. However, the hull had originally been carefully designed to reduce weight based on the initial arrangements. The modifications to London added heavy weights fore and aft and severely overstressed the hull. As a result cracks and <b>loose</b> <b>rivets</b> began to appear on the upper deck. The upper deck was reinforced, which caused the stress to be transmitted through the lower hull instead and cracks began to appear under the waterline. It took underwater reinforcements and refits extending into 1943 to remedy the situation.|$|R
40|$|Reliable Non Destructive Testing (NDT) {{is vital}} to the {{integrity}} and performance management of capital assets in safety critical industries such as aerospace, transportation, pipelines, petro-chemical processing, and power generation []. The structures that are to be inspected are usually very large and located in remote and hazardous environments. The NDT system has to be deployed by first providing very expensive access, requiring the erection of scaffolding and lengthy preparation before NDT can start. In addition the system must be capable of finding and characterizing component and structural defects to a high probability of detection thereby decreasing the probability of failure. Another priority is to reduce outage time as the cost of loss of production runs into millions. This presentation describes recent developments in mobile wall climbing, swimming and pipe crawling robots that provide the means to perform NDT on difficult to access structures and provide the possibility of carrying out the NDT in-service thus preventing costly outages. In confined and hazardous environments they are the only means to reach a test site and perform the NDT.

As Goofy struggles to shake the bucket off, he lets <b>loose</b> several <b>rivets</b> and finally gets the bucket off by sliding on a skateboard. He swings around on a gas pump and heads toward Donald, who puts down a plank of wood for Goofy to cross the underground station. Goofy bangs into Donald and causes Donald to hit a larger oil can, which splatters oil everywhere. Goofy slides around on the oil (his movements looking like he is doing a tap dance) and finally gets off the slick, causing Mickey and the car to crash to the ground, and Goofy gets his head stuck in the lever. Just then, Pete arrives. He pushes Mickey aside and gets into the car, but due to the team's inadequate work, the car won't start. They tiptoe away while Pete is distracted and as they watch the car dismantles itself until only the engine is remaining. The engine moves forward on four [...] "legs" [...] and chases Pete away, banging into him the whole time.|$|R
