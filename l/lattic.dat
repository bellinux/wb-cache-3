50|$|As {{part of the}} 1964 naval program, the Royal Canadian Navy {{planned to}} improve the attack {{capabilities}} of the Restigouche-class. Unable to convert the vessels to helicopter-carrying versions like the St. Laurents due to budget constraints, instead Restigouche-class ships were to receive variable depth sonar (VDS) to improve their sonar range, placed on the stern, and the RUR-5 anti-submarine rocket (ASROC). The destroyers also received a stepped <b>lattic</b> mast. Called the Improved Restigouche Escorts (IRE), Terra Nova {{was the first to}} undergo conversion, beginning in May 1965. The conversion took ten months to complete, followed by sea trials. The sea trials delayed the conversion of the next ship for four years. By 1969, the budget for naval programs had been cut and only four out of the seven (Terra Nova, Restigouche, Gatineau and Kootenay) would get upgraded to IRE standards and the remaining three (Chaudière, Columbia, and St. Croix) were placed in reserve.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the quantum breathing mode (monopole oscillation) of trapped fermionic particles with Coulomb and dipole interaction in {{one and two}} dimensions. This collective oscillation {{has been shown to}} reveal detailed information on the many-particle state of interacting trapped systems and is thus a sensitive diagnostics for a variety of finite systems, including cold atomic and molecular gases in traps and optical <b>lattics,</b> electrons in metal clusters and in quantum confined semiconductor structures or nanoplasmas. An improved sum rule formalism allows us to accurately determine the breathing frequencies from the ground state of the system, avoiding complicated time-dependent simulations. In combination with the Hartree-Fock and the Thomas-Fermi approximations this enables us to extend the calculations to large particle numbers $N$ on the order of several million. Tracing the breathing frequency to large $N$ {{as a function of the}} coupling parameter of the system reveals a surprising difference of the asymptotic behavior of one-dimensional and two-dimensional harmonically trapped Coulomb systems.
