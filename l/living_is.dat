5|$|Despite {{the strong}} economy, the Bay Area's housing market {{and cost of}} <b>living</b> <b>is</b> {{becoming}} increasingly expensive. As of 2017, the average income {{needed in order to}} purchase a house in the region was $179,390, while the median price for a house was $895,000. Because of the high cost of living, many workers in the Bay Area live far from their place of employment, contributing to one of the highest percentages of extreme commuters in the United States, or commutes that take over ninety minutes in one direction. For example, about 50,000 people commute from neighboring San Joaquin county into the nine-county Bay Area daily.|$|E
