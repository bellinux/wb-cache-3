25|$|Secondary {{consciousness}} {{is seen in}} animals with semantic capabilities, such as the four great apes. It is present in its richest form in the human species, which is unique in possessing complex language made up of syntax and semantics. In considering how the neural mechanisms underlying primary consciousness arose and were maintained during evolution, it is proposed that at some time around the divergence of reptiles into mammals and then into birds, the embryological development {{of large numbers of}} new reciprocal connections allowed rich re-entrant activity to take place between the more posterior brain systems carrying out perceptual categorization and the more frontally located systems responsible for value-category memory. The ability of an animal to relate a present complex scene to its own previous history of learning conferred an adaptive evolutionary advantage. At much later evolutionary epochs, further re-entrant circuits appeared that linked semantic and <b>linguistic</b> <b>performance</b> to categorical and conceptual memory systems. This development enabled the emergence of secondary consciousness.|$|E
25|$|To provide clarity, cross-linguistic {{influence}} can {{be understood}} as the various ways that two or more languages relate in the mind and affect a persons <b>linguistic</b> <b>performance</b> or development. Cross-linguistic effects of orthographic and semantic overlap between different languages of cognates and interlingual homographs were also reported in many priming studies. For example, Beauvillain and Grainger had French-English bilinguals make English lexical decisions on target strings primed by French words, which was told to the participants. The homographic primes were French words that were either semantically related to the English words (e.g., coin-money, where coin means corner in French) or not related. The results showed that the bilinguals responded faster in related conditions than unrelated conditions. Even though the participants knew that the prime words were always belonged to their French meaning, they were still affected by the English meaning of the homographic prime words. In the later studies, researchers masked the briefly presented prime words to prevent participants from using conscious strategies. For example, Sáchez-Casas et al. used Spanish-English bilinguals in a semantic categorization task on Spanish target words. They used three types of priming conditions: entirely identical cognates or non-cognates (rico-rico; pato-pato), translations of cognates or non-cognates (rich-rico; duck-pato) and non-word primes combined with cognate or non-cognate targets as a control condition (rict-rico vs. wuck-pato). They found that the bilinguals responded to the cognate translation conditions as fast as the identical conditions, but the non-cognate translation was as slow as the control conditions.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1981 Linguistic delays are a {{frequent}} concomitant of reduced intellectual ability. The present study examined linguistic development in intellectually impaired children with {{fetal alcohol syndrome}} (FAS). The purposes {{of the study were}} to describe the level of linguistic functioning in a group of five-year-old children with FAS and {{to assess the impact of}} reduced intellectual ability on the <b>linguistic</b> <b>performances</b> of these children. The <b>linguistic</b> <b>performances</b> of FAS children were compared to similar data from normally developing children from comparable age, sex and socioeconomic groupings, as well as to the following control groups: (1) a group of three-year-old MLU matched normal children, and (2) a group of five-year-old intellectually matched children with Prader-Willi syndrome. These subjects' <b>linguistic</b> <b>performances</b> were assessed by examining syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic development. In addition, since short-term memory deficits have been reported to occur in adults who misuse alcohol, short-term memory capabilities were examined in FAS children to determine if similar deficits existed. When compared to normative data as well as to MLU matched younger normal children, the results of this study clearly indicated that children with FAS were delayed in syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and short-term memory functioning. The linguistic delays were more pronounced in production rather than comprehension of linguistic information. Short-term memory deficits were more pronounced in short-term memory for related syllables (sentences) rather than for unrelated word series. The results of this study did not substantiate the impact of reduced intellectual ability on the <b>linguistic</b> <b>performances</b> observed in FAS children...|$|R

Even at this phase she distinguished the names of similar objects, {{even if they were}} unfamiliar, but never overgeneralized words for individual objects. For something unfamiliar she always sought the correct word or phrase instead of attempting to apply a word from her existing vocabulary, and could determine the names of objects based on their uses.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s, Chomsky {{introduced}} two central ideas {{relevant to}} the construction and evaluation of grammatical theories. The first was the distinction between competence and performance. Chomsky noted the obvious fact that people, when speaking in the real world, often make linguistic errors (e.g., starting a sentence and then abandoning it midway through). He argued that these errors in <b>linguistic</b> <b>performance</b> were ir{{relevant to the}} study of linguistic competence (the knowledge that allows people to construct and understand grammatical sentences). Consequently, the linguist can study an idealised version of language, greatly simplifying linguistic analysis (see the [...] "Grammaticality" [...] section below). The second idea related directly to the evaluation of theories of grammar. Chomsky distinguished between grammars that achieve descriptive adequacy and those that go further and achieved explanatory adequacy. A descriptively adequate grammar for a particular language defines the (infinite) set of grammatical sentences in that language; that is, it describes the language in its entirety. A grammar that achieves explanatory adequacy has the additional property that it gives an insight into the underlying linguistic structures in the human mind; that is, it does not merely describe the grammar of a language, but makes predictions about how linguistic knowledge is mentally represented. For Chomsky, the nature of such mental representations is largely innate, so if a grammatical theory has explanatory adequacy it must be able to explain the various grammatical nuances of the languages of the world as relatively minor variations in the universal pattern of human language. Chomsky argued that, even though linguists were still a long way from constructing descriptively adequate grammars, progress in terms of descriptive adequacy will only come if linguists hold explanatory adequacy as their goal. In other words, real insight into the structure of individual languages can only be gained through comparative study {{of a wide range of}} languages, on the assumption that they are all cut from the same cloth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Language {{change is}} {{increasingly}} {{recognized as one}} of the most crucial sources of evidence for understanding human cognition. Unfortunately, despite sophisticated methods for documenting which changes have taken place, the question of why languages evolve over time remains open for speculation. This paper presents a novel research method that addresses this issue by combining agentbased experiments with deep language processing, and demonstrates the approach through a case study on German definite articles. More specifically, two populations of autonomous agents are equipped with a model of Old High German (500 – 1100 AD) and Modern High German definite articles respectively, and a set of self-assessment criteria for evaluating their own <b>linguistic</b> <b>performances.</b> The experiments show that inefficiencies detected in the grammar by the Old High German agents correspond to grammatical forms that have actually undergone the most important changes in the German language. The results thus suggest that the question of language change can be reformulated as an optimization problem in which language users try to achieve their communicative goals while allocating their cognitive resources as efficiently as possible. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on {{language}} objects in contemporary ‘word cities’, or urban landscapes, shaped by art and consumer culture. I define ‘language objects’ as two- or three-dimensional pieces of writing (e. g. needlework samplers, fridge magnets, wooden or metal sculptures, etc.) that do not serve any apparent informational or utilitarian purpose, i. e. they are not ‘attached’ to or displayed on any objects with identifiable practical functions, e. g. buildings, t-shirts, mugs, paper weights, and so on. Two specific language objects considered here are Robert Indiana’s LOVE sculpture and a Marks & Spencer ‘love letters decoration’. It is suggested that such language objects perform largely Jakobson’s (1960) poetic function with its key focus on form. Yet, they are also instances of <b>linguistic</b> <b>performances</b> with complex trajectories of appropriation and recontextualization of prior cultural and linguistic material (Bauman, 2001; Bauman & Briggs, 1990), while their appropriation for specific ‘personal’ uses is best explained by treating them as ‘shifters’ — referential indexes, or signs constituted by the combination of their symbolic value and the communicative act itself (or ‘rules of use’) (Jakobson, 1971; Silverstein, 1976) ...|$|R
40|$|Lying is {{a complex}} {{cognitive}} process that involves additional attentional and processing resources. Recent findings suggest that lying is characterized by an intent to deceive which requires the inhabitation of a predominant response (i. e., telling the truth) {{and the construction of}} a false narrative. In psycholinguistics, several studies have shown that interlocutors' lexical choices influence each other in that conversational partners tend to converge on same patterns of use (i. e., lexical entrainment). In this study, I developed an experimental paradigm with pairs of naive participants with the aim to investigate how lying affects lexical entrainment and impacts interlocutors' <b>linguistic</b> <b>performances</b> in terms of duration of dialogue and liars' individual contribution to it. Results showed that lying was associated with a higher tendency to lexically align compared to truth-telling but only when crucial elements of the discourse were concerned. The tendency appears, hence, to be mediated by a desire to be believed. Deceptive and truthful interactions did not show different processing times, which indicates that the duration of dialogues and recaps was not a reliable measure of the cognitive dynamic occurring during lying in dialogic communication...|$|R
