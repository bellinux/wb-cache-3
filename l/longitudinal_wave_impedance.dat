40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} paper, the {{relationship}} between characteristic <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> and compositions was mainly investigated {{in order to find}} a suitable theoretical model for predicting the impedance value of Ti-Mo system composites and FGM. At first, dense Ti-Mo composites with different weight fractions of Mo were prepared. Then the transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave</b> velocities of the samples were measured and the characteristic <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> values were obtained. A mixture model was adopted to estimate the characteristic <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> value of Ti-Mo composites. Comparisons between the estimated and experimental results demonstrated that the suggested model was sufficiently accurate to predict the characteristic <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> value of Ti-Mo system composites and FGM...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{approach}} is proposed for retrieving the {{forward and backward}} <b>wave</b> <b>impedances</b> of lossless and lossy bianisotropic metamaterials. Compared with other methods in the literature, its main advantage is that forward and backward <b>wave</b> <b>impedances</b> can be uniquely and noniteratively extracted. It has been validated for both lossless and lossy bianisotropic metamaterials by performing a numerical analysis. The proposed approach can be applied for checking whether the metamaterial structure shows the bianisotropic property by monitoring forward and backward <b>wave</b> <b>impedances,</b> since the forward and backward <b>wave</b> <b>impedances</b> of a metamaterial structure depend on different polarizations of the incident wave.

40|$|Summary. If thermal and {{mechanical}} coupling is neglected, {{there is a}} class of isothermal strain energy functions for isotropic compressible hyperelastic solids, that admits the propagation of a finite amplitude transverse wave, without a coupled <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave,</b> and a subclass that admits the simultaneous propagation of an uncoupled finite amplitude transverse <b>wave</b> and a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave</b> [1]. Several examples of this class of strain energy function are discussed. When thermal {{and mechanical}} coupling is considered the solid is described as thermoelastic. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the possibility of the propagation of a finite amplitude transverse wave without a coupled <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave,</b> or the uncoupled simultaneous propagation of a finite amplitude transverse <b>wave</b> and a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave,</b> in an isotropic thermoelastic solid that has no underlying deformation. It is shown that an extensive class of isotropic thermoelastic solids does not admit the propagation of an uncoupled finite amplitude transverse wave, with or without an uncoupled <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave,</b> even if the corresponding hyperelastic solid does. ...|$|R

The research work revealed the quite different <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wave</b> velocity changes between under the simple and pure shear states and also distinguished longitudinal velocity change under the pure shear state, {{on the other}} hand transverse wave velocity changes under simple and pure shear states showed almost the same change tendencies similar to the texture development under both shear states. Therefore, to clear the different effects due to plastic deformation on transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>waves</b> velocity changes under simple and pure shear states the microstructural changes of polycrystal solids were investigated via finite element polycrystal model (FEPM).

30|$|By Eq. (1), the <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> {{decreases}} as the {{distributed capacitance}} increases, and increases as the distributed reactance increases. Usually the <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> of overhead lines is between 270 and 380  Ω [14]. The mutual inductance {{approaches to the}} self-reactance when the cable cores are arranged closely. The equivalent distributed reactance is greatly reduced when the values of currents in two cores are the same with opposite directions. At the same time, when {{the distance between the}} cable cores is closer and the insulation material between the cores has a relative dielectric constant up to 4 or 5, the distributed capacitance is greatly increased. So the cable’s <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> would be much less than overhead line’s <b>impedance.</b> The cable’s <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> would be approximately 1 / 7 of overhead line’s impedance [15]. From Eq. (2), {{it can be seen that}} the transmission capability of a cable is approximately 7 times those of overhead lines or catenaries at the same voltage level, since the natural power is inversely proportional to the <b>wave</b> <b>impedance.</b> Empirical data [14] show that the output power at one side of a single loop (head-to-end) of 35  kV overhead lines can reach up to 10  MW with a transmission distance of approximately 20  km, while the output power of cables under the same condition can reach up to 70  MW (for double-loop circuit lines to 140  MW). Thus it can be derived that the cable’s one-side transmission distance is up to 100  km or longer. It is able to fully meet the needs of any metro or light rail line.|$|R
