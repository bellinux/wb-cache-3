25|$|Everson {{has also}} created locale and <b>{{language}}</b> <b>information</b> for many languages, from {{support for the}} Irish language and the other Celtic languages to the minority Languages of Finland. In 2000, together with Trond Trosterud, he co-authored Software localization into Nynorsk Norwegian, a report commissioned by the Norwegian Language Council. In 2003 he was commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme to prepare {{a report on the}} computer locale requirements for the major languages of Afghanistan (Pashto, Dari, and Uzbek), co-authored by Roozbeh Pournader, which was endorsed by the Ministry of Communications of the Afghan Transitional Islamic Administration. More recently, UNESCO's Initiative B@bel funded Everson's work to encode the N'Ko and Balinese scripts.|$|E
500|$|Much work in {{neurolinguistics}} involves {{testing and}} evaluating theories {{put forth by}} psycholinguists and theoretical linguists. [...] In general, theoretical linguists propose models to explain the structure of language and how <b>language</b> <b>information</b> is organized, psycholinguists propose models and algorithms to explain how <b>language</b> <b>information</b> is processed in the mind, and neurolinguists analyze brain activity to infer how biological structures (populations and networks of neurons) carry out those psycholinguistic processing algorithms. [...] For example, experiments in sentence processing have used the ELAN, N400, and P600 brain responses to examine how physiological brain responses reflect the different predictions of sentence processing models put forth by psycholinguists, such as Janet Fodor and Lyn Frazier's [...] "serial" [...] model, and Theo Vosse and Gerard Kempen's [...] "unification model". [...] Neurolinguists can also make new predictions about the structure and organization of language based on insights about the physiology of the brain, by [...] "generalizing from the knowledge of neurological structures to language structure".|$|E

500|$|Much work in {{neurolinguistics}} has, like Broca's and Wernicke's early studies, {{investigated the}} locations of specific language [...] "modules" [...] within the brain. [...] Research questions include what course <b>language</b> <b>information</b> follows through the brain as it is processed, whether or not particular areas specialize in processing particular sorts of information, how different brain regions {{interact with one another}} in language processing, and how {{the locations of}} brain activation differs when a subject is producing or perceiving a language other than his or her first language.|$|E
2500|$|The guides are {{different}} from other travel guidebooks in {{that in addition to}} providing travel information, history, and basic <b>language</b> <b>information,</b> they also provide reviews of the wines produced by each winery covered creating a hybrid book that is part travel guide and part wine guide, thus the name, 'vinologue' which is a portmanteau of 'vino' and 'travelogue'. [...] The guides work to make wine both approachable and affordable for any audience and they purposefully don't award numeric scores to wines given that beyond tasting notes, they believe scores to be highly subjective and personal.|$|E
2500|$|One {{possibility}} is that bilinguals initially {{make a decision about}} the language of the word and then activate the appropriate language-selected lexicon. In this mechanism, an executive system directs the language switch for the input word. In earlier studies, researchers found that bilinguals can comprehend passages composed of words entirely from only one language more quickly than passages composed of words from both languages. They explain this result as an involuntary switch that happens when bilinguals comprehend passages with two languages. When comprehension procedures in one language fail due to the language contextually changing, then the switch mechanism will automatically direct input to another language system. Therefore, bilinguals are slower at reading mixed language passages than at single language passages because they must spend time on switching languages. However, those studies failed to consider that the two languages might be activated simultaneously and there might be a later lexical competition in choosing which <b>language</b> <b>information</b> to use. The later lexical completion {{can also be used to}} explain why bilinguals spend more time understanding passages in mixed languages. [...] However, other studies have found that there is no significant cost incurred by inter-sentential language switching and mixing. showed that there was no cost to switching between languages when bilinguals read sentences for comprehension. Additionally, Guzzardo Tamargo, R.E. found that when making metalinguistic judgments and performing non-comprehension based tasks, switch costs were evident but there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that there is a cost at the switch site when bilinguals read a mixed sentence. This indicates that under normal circumstances and given sufficient linguistic context, language switching does not incur a cost.|$|E
