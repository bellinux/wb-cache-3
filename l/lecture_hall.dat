5|$|At {{the same}} time as his work on the Scott Building, Alexander was asked to take up the {{challenge}} of completing the Smithsonian Institution Building, the progress of which had bogged down under architect James Renwick, Jr. In August 1853, Alexander accepted, and by 1855, the Smithsonian Building was complete. During construction, Alexander slightly altered Renwick's original design by placing the Smithsonian's main <b>lecture</b> <b>hall</b> on the second floor. The change allowed for superior acoustics and a wider space than could be found on the first floor. To support the large <b>lecture</b> <b>hall</b> and the central core of the building, Alexander arranged for the installation of fireproof masonry-encased iron structural columns. These would prove their value on January 24, 1865, when a fire broke out on the roof above the <b>lecture</b> <b>hall.</b> The resulting blaze destroyed the hall and damaged {{much of the rest of}} the structure. Thanks to the fireproof columns, however, the Smithsonian building did not collapse.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{includes}} Tenri University, Tenri Hospital, Tenri Seminary, the Besseki <b>Lecture</b> <b>Hall,</b> the Shuyoka, dormitories, and Tenri High School. Currently 25 {{wings of}} the complex are complete. The complete structure calls for 68 wings.|$|E
5|$|Librescu is {{most widely}} {{known for his}} actions during the Virginia Tech shooting, when he held the doors to his <b>lecture</b> <b>hall</b> closed, {{allowing}} {{all but one of}} his students enough time to escape through the windows. Shot and killed during the attack, Librescu was posthumously awarded the Order of the Star of Romania, the country's highest civilian honor. Coincidentally, Librescu's act of heroism happened on the 27th of Nisan on the Jewish lunar calendar. That date is Yom HaShoah which is Holocaust Remembrance Day in Israel.|$|E

The East auditorium, which was the scene of the incident, will no longer be used for classes, and a replacement <b>lecture</b> <b>hall</b> will be built elsewhere on campus. On January 27, 2010, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn came to the NIU campus to release the funds for the renovation of Cole Hall.|$|E

5|$|Tucker's {{effectiveness}} in the <b>lecture</b> <b>hall</b> is not objectively certain, {{and he may}} well have encountered difficulty with public speaking as {{he had in the}} courtroom previously. His continued faculty chairmanship certainly testified to his relative popularity among colleagues, and he published numerous works—including one satire, a fiction, three books on economics and statistics, a Jefferson biography, as well as two pamphlets. Together with Robley Dunglison he founded and edited the Virginia Literary Museum (1829–1830) in which he published voluminous writings; and he frequently sent essays to newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|Designed {{and built}} by the Public Works Department, the new red-bricked {{building}} was officially opened and christened as the National Library on 12 November 1960 by the President of Singapore, Yusof bin Ishak. The architecture was said to reflect the red-brick epoch of British architecture in the 1950s. Hedwig Anuar was appointed the first Singaporean Director of the National Library in April 1960 and served until June 1961. Aside from its extensive English collection, the library also made Chinese, Malay and Tamil books available for loan. Occupying a total floor area of 10,242 square metres, the library included reading sections for adults and children, a microfilm unit and a <b>lecture</b> <b>hall.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the centre}} of the quad is the Harris Building, {{formerly}} Oriel court, a real tennis court where Charles I played tennis with his nephew Prince Rupert in December 1642 and King Edward VII had his first tennis lesson in 1859.

5|$|The {{observatory}} {{was originally}} built by Worchester R. Warner and Ambrose Swasey, owners of Warner & Swasey Company, which made precision instruments and telescopes {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries. They became trustees of the Case School of Applied Science (later renamed to Case Institute of Technology), and built an observatory in East Cleveland, which they gave to the school in 1919. This original observatory building was located on Taylor Road four {{miles east of the}} university campus and housed a 9.5-inch refractor, and was dedicated in 1920. The building was designed by the firm of Walker and Weeks. In subsequent years the observatory grew to house several more telescopes and instruments, such as the 24-inch Burrell Schmidt telescope, as well as an astronomical library and public <b>lecture</b> <b>hall.</b>|$|E
5|$|Uxbridge Football Club was {{provided}} {{with the use of}} the station stadium from 1923 and played evening matches there. Ten barrack blocks designed by A. Gilpin were built around the parade ground in 1925, as was the RAF officers' hospital and the original Operations Room, controlled by the Fighting Area of Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB). The Air Ministry chose RAF Uxbridge as the new base for ADGB on 14 January 1926 owing to its proximity to Whitehall. The site had the added advantage of lying on the fringes of London and therefore difficult for an enemy to locate and bomb. Having also housed a gymnasium, the <b>lecture</b> <b>hall</b> building became the station cinema in 1927, initially for the use of station personnel only but soon opened to the general public. On 1 March 1929, the headquarters of the Observer Corps was established at Hillingdon House; Air Commodore Edward Masterman was appointed its first commandant. The Observer Corps remained at RAF Uxbridge until 1 March 1936, when it transferred to RAF Bentley Priory.|$|E

25|$|In 1897, Lowell became lecturer, and in 1898, {{professor}} of government at Harvard. His publishing career continued {{with the appearance of}} Colonial Civil Service in 1900, and The Government of England in two volumes in 1908. In December 1901, Lowell and his wife donated funds anonymously to erect a building housing a large <b>lecture</b> <b>hall,</b> a facility the university lacked at the time. It became the New <b>Lecture</b> <b>Hall</b> (later renamed Lowell <b>Lecture</b> <b>Hall),</b> at the corner of Oxford and Kneeland Streets, and held a 928-seat auditorium as well as 8 meeting rooms.|$|E
