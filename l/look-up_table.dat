5|$|When clocked, {{the phase}} {{accumulator}} (PA) creates a modulo-2N sawtooth waveform {{which is then}} converted by the phase-to-amplitude converter (PAC) to a sampled sinusoid, where N {{is the number of}} bits carried in the phase accumulator. N sets the NCO frequency resolution and is normally much larger than the number of bits defining the memory space of the PAC <b>look-up</b> <b>table.</b> If the PAC capacity is 2M, the PA output word must be truncated to M bits as shown in Figure 1. However, the truncated bits can be used for interpolation. The truncation of the phase output word does not affect the frequency accuracy but produces a time-varying periodic phase error which is a primary source of spurious products. Another spurious product generation mechanism is finite word length effects of the PAC output (amplitude) word.|$|E

25|$|A framebuffer is {{a digital}} device for {{computers}} which stores {{data in the}} so-called video memory (comprising an array of Video RAM or similar chips). This data goes either to three digital-to-analog converters (DACs) (for analog monitors), one per primary color, or directly to digital monitors. Driven by software, the CPU (or other specialized chips) write the appropriate bytes into the video memory to define the image. Modern systems encode pixel color values by devoting eight bits {{to each of the}} R, G, and B components. RGB information can be either carried directly by the pixel bits themselves or provided by a separate color <b>look-up</b> <b>table</b> (CLUT) if indexed color graphic modes are used.|$|E

If the PA output word were used directly to index the PAC <b>look-up</b> <b>table</b> an untenably high storage {{capacity in the}} ROM would be required. As such, the PA output word must be truncated to span a reasonable memory space. Truncation of the phase word causes phase modulation of the output sinusoid which introduces non-harmonic distortion {{in proportion to the}} number of bits truncated. The number of spurious products created by this distortion is given by: ...|$|E

In many cases, <b>look-up</b> <b>tables</b> are the method of choice for real-time applications. <b>Look-up</b> <b>tables</b> have had wide-spread use in trade studies, planning tools, training simulations, and other applications and {{have proven to be}} both extremely valuable for real-time casualty assessment and at times misunderstood in what capabilities they provide. <b>Look-up</b> <b>tables</b> facilitate fast retrieval of vulnerability data, with measurable trade-offs between memory requirements, computation requirements, and fidelity. As processing power has increased, higher-fidelity algorithms of casualty assessment have gained wider use, suggesting that <b>look-up</b> <b>tables</b> may eventually become obsolete. This paper describes the casualty assessment modeling spectrum from low fidelity to high fidelity, including <b>look-up</b> <b>tables,</b> curve fits, physics-based models, and finite element codes.

Guidelines for how to determine what model type to select and what factors should be considered when selecting a model are discussed.

In December 1973 LaRouche asked the couple {{to return to the}} U.S. His followers sent tapes of the subsequent sessions with White to The New York Times as evidence of an assassination plot. According to the Times, [...] "here are sounds of weeping, and vomiting on the tapes, and Mr. White complains of being deprived of sleep, food and cigarettes. At one point someone says 'raise the voltage,' but (LaRouche) says this was associated with the bright lights used in the questioning rather than an electric shock." [...] The Times wrote, [...] "Mr. White complains of a terrible pain in his arm, then LaRouche can be heard saying, 'That's not real. That's in the program'."

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{identification of}} flux linkages and inductances {{play a vital}} role in developing high-performance control methods for synchronous motors (SMs). In this thesis, the identification of flux maps of SMs at constant speed is done. The aim of this thesis is to achieve <b>look-up</b> <b>tables</b> of flux linkages as a function of machine currents. Simulation are performed on a 6. 7 -kW synchronous reluctance motor (SyRM). The current controlled SyRM, operating at constant speed, is fed with current sequences and the corresponding voltages are calculated. By using these calculated voltages, the motor flux linkages are identified and stored in the form of <b>look-up</b> <b>tables.</b> The iron losses and stator resistance variation are compensated during the identification process. Theses linkage <b>look-up</b> <b>tables</b> can be used as a benchmark for testing different saturation models of synchronous motors. From these <b>look-up</b> <b>tables,</b> the information about motor inductances can be obtained which can be used to fully exploit the motor torque and speed range by determining various control strategies such as the maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) and maximum torque per volt (MTPV) ...|$|R
