5|$|The king {{known today}} as Magnus VI of Norway (the first Norwegian king known to use regnal numbers) {{originally}} used the regnal number IV for himself in contemporary Latin letters, <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> Magnus Haraldsson. As the numbering system has seen changes in modern times, Magnus Haraldsson is today included as Magnus II.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
50|$|Linear logic, {{in which}} {{duplicated}} hypotheses 'count' differently from single occurrences, <b>leaves</b> <b>out</b> {{both of these}} rules, while relevant (or relevance) logics merely <b>leaves</b> <b>out</b> the latter rule, {{on the ground that}} B is clearly irrelevant to the conclusion.|$|R

50|$|Proportional Control Action <b>leaves</b> <b>out</b> {{an error}} called Offset Error. While a {{disturbance}} (deviation from existing state) {{occurs in the}} Steady State Condition, any corrective control action, based purely on Proportional Control, will always <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> an error between the next steady state and the desired setpoint. This error is called an Offset Error.|$|R
5|$|García Márquez {{was also}} noted for <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> {{seemingly}} important details and events so {{the reader is}} forced into a more participatory role in the story development. For example, in No One Writes to the Colonel, the main characters are not given names. This practice is influenced by Greek tragedies, such as Antigone and Oedipus Rex, in which important events occur off-stage and are left to the audience's imagination.|$|E
5|$|The couple's first child, Mary Prudentia Hogg, {{was born}} in November 1827. Her parents did their best not to spread the news, because she was born soon after they began cohabiting. Mary Prudentia died in May 1829. Jane gave birth to their second daughter, Prudentia, in 1836, and Mary Shelley was {{selected}} as her godmother. Hogg's friendship with Mary Shelley was disrupted several years later, however, when she republished Percy Shelley's Queen Mab in 1839. Hogg rebuked her for <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> its previous dedication to Harriet Shelley, {{and they did not}} communicate with each other for several years.|$|E
5|$|While Drive {{is set in}} {{the present}} day, it carries a heavy 1980s {{atmosphere}} that is cautiously set from beginning to end and is underlined not only by the vehicles or music and clothes, but also by its architecture. The parts of the city seen in the Valley and by downtown Los Angeles are cheap stucco and mirrored glass, often <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> more contemporary buildings. Drab background settings include the southern California commercial strip. As the Los Angeles Times pointed out, whenever gleaming buildings are shown, it is because they are being seen from a distance. Refn shot those scenes from a helicopter at night in Bunker Hill, Los Angeles.|$|E
5000|$|In English, the {{formation}} of the passive allows the optional inclusion of an agent in a prepositional phrase, [...] "by the man", etc. Where English would <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> the noun phrase, Irish uses the autonomous; where English includes the noun phrase, Irish uses its periphrastic passive - which can also <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> the noun phrase: ...|$|R

5|$|The sequel, Xenosaga Episode II, was {{developed}} by a new team with Takahashi overseeing the project so the series could be taken {{in a new direction}} by younger staff members within Monolith Soft. The scenario, written by Norihiko Yonesaka based on the initial draft by Takahashi and Saga, ended up <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> a lot of the originally planned content. Episode II was released in Japan in June 2004, while it was released in North America in February 2005. The sequel was also published in Europe by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe in October of that year. Both Episode I and Episode II were re-imagined for the Nintendo DS as Xenosaga I & II, released in March 2006. Co-developed by Monolith Soft and Tom Create, the scenario was supervised by Takahashi and included material which needed to be cut from the original releases of the first two Xenosaga games. Xenosaga I & II remains exclusive to Japan.|$|E
5|$|In Skinner's office, Krycek gets up {{from his}} chair and starts <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> the doorway. Skinner goes after him, then turns around and sees Miles {{approaching}} behind him. Skinner just manages to escape with Krycek (who was purposely closing the elevator doors on Skinner), but Miles' hand breaks through the elevator door, injuring Skinner and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital, Mulder distrusts what Doggett has been told by Knowle Rohrer, so the two set out to find out how trustworthy Rohrer really is. Meanwhile, at Doggett's abandoned hometown where Reyes and Scully are hiding out, Reyes sees someone running off and follows whoever it is. A car pulls up and she meets a trooper who agrees to help with the birth. As Mulder and Doggett pull into the garage, they find Krycek pulling up in another car, with a passenger who happens to be Rohrer. Mulder believes that Rohrer and Krycek are colluding together but don't understand how/what for. Doggett covertly pursues Rohrer and learns that Rohrer has an accomplice: Agent Crane.|$|E

25|$|Although he is {{virtually}} unheard of today, Levy {{was one of}} the most notorious gunfighters of his time. Both Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp mentioned his name and his abilities. Earp praised Levy for his practical approach in a gunfight, <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> fast draw theatrics and opting for calm accuracy instead.|$|E
25|$|Although {{successful}} as a precision timekeeper, the Admiralty {{for obvious reasons}} wanted a timekeeper on every major ship, and Kendall's was too expensive and took too long to make. Kendall made a simplified version (K2) in 1771, <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> the complicated remontoir system. But the result was still too costly and, moreover, not as accurate as the original.|$|E

25|$|The Wheeler–DeWitt {{equation}} {{that combines}} general relativity and quantum mechanics – by <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> time altogether – {{was introduced in}} the 1960s and it was taken up again in 1983, when the theorists Don Page and William Wootters made a solution based on the quantum phenomenon of entanglement. Page and Wootters argued that entanglement can be used to measure time.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} his revised scenario, Bourne somewhat altered Tchaikovsky's score, reordering several numbers and omitting others. For example, No. 5 {{has been moved}} in its entirety from Act One to Act Three, where it follows the (reordered) national dances. Act Three has been trimmed by <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> most of No. 19 {{and all of the}} following pas de deux.|$|E

Some scholars denounce the insertion as <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> Rashi's advocacy for giving the gifts as recorded in his responsum.|$|E

25|$|However, some {{clothing}} {{retailers and}} mail order companies {{have their own}} house brands and use a custom sizing system. Marks and Spencers uses AA-A-B-C-D-DD-E-F-G-GG-H-J, <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> FF and HH. As a result, their J-Cup is equal to a British standard H-cup. Evans and ASDA sell bras (ASDA {{as part of their}} George clothing range) whose sizing runs A-B-C-D-DD-E-F-G-H. Their H-Cup is roughly equal to a British standard G-cup.|$|E
25|$|The Pale {{boundary}} essentially {{consisted of}} a fortified ditch and rampart built around parts of the medieval counties of Louth, Meath, Dublin and Kildare, <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> half of Meath, most of Kildare, and southwest County Dublin.
