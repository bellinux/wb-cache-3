25|$|The acute porphyrias are acute {{intermittent}} porphyria (AIP), {{variegate porphyria}} (VP), amino <b>levulinic</b> <b>acid</b> dehydratase deficiency (ALAD) and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). These diseases primarily affect the nervous system, resulting in episodic crises known as acute attacks. The major symptom of an acute attack is abdominal pain, often accompanied by vomiting, hypertension (elevated blood pressure), and tachycardia (an abnormally rapid heart rate). The most severe episodes may involve neurological complications: typically motor neuropathy (severe dysfunction of the peripheral nerves that innervate muscle), which leads to muscle weakness and potentially to quadriplegia (paralysis of all four limbs) and central nervous system symptoms such as seizures and coma. Occasionally, there may be short-lived psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, and, very rarely, overt psychosis. All these symptoms resolve once the acute attack passes. Porphyria is not a cause of chronic psychiatric illness, though an association with anxiety and depression has been suggested.|$|E
50|$|In 1840 the Dutch Professor G.J. Mulder {{mentioned}} <b>levulinic</b> <b>acid</b> for {{the first}} time. He synthesized it by heating fructose with hydrochloric acid. The former term “levulose” for fructose gave <b>levulinic</b> <b>acid</b> its name. Although <b>levulinic</b> <b>acid</b> has been well known since the 1870s, it has never reached a commercial use in significant volume. First commercial production of <b>levulinic</b> <b>acid</b> began as a batchwise process in an autoclave by A.E. Statley in the 1940s. In 1953 the US company Quaker Oats developed a continuous process {{for the production of}} <b>levulinic</b> <b>acid.</b> In 1956 it was identified as a platform chemical with high potential and in 2004 the US Department of Energy (U.S. DoE) identified <b>levulinic</b> <b>acid</b> by screening approximately 300 substances as one of the 12 potential platform chemicals in the biorefinery concept.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{synthesis of}} <b>levulinic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is done by}} heating hexoses (glucose, fructose) or starch in dilute hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. The yield depends {{on the nature of}} the acid, acid concentration, temperature and pressure. In addition to formic acid further, partly insoluble, by-products are produced. These are deeply colored and their complete removal is a challenge for most technologies. Many concepts for the commercial production of <b>levulinic</b> <b>acid</b> are based on a strong acid technology. The processes are conducted in a continuous manner using lignocellulose as inexpensive starting material which is impregnated by dilute mineral acid and transferred to a high pressure reactor where it is heated with steam to allow the reaction to form <b>levulinic</b> <b>acid</b> to take place. After cooling the reaction mixture and filtering off the solid by-products, the <b>levulinic</b> <b>acid</b> that is formed is separated from the mineral acid catalyst by extraction without neutralization of the acid catalyst. This allows the acid catalyst to be recycled, while the <b>levulinic</b> <b>acid</b> can be purified from the acid-free organic solvent. Pure <b>levulinic</b> <b>acid</b> is isolated by evaporation of the extraction solvent and distillation of the <b>levulinic</b> <b>acid.</b> Companies who developed technology based on this concept include Biofine, DSM, Segetis, and GFBiochemicals. GFBiochemicals started the commercial production of <b>levulinic</b> <b>acid</b> in 2015 at a production scale of 2,000 MT/a in Caserta, Italy. 2Caserta is the world's largest operational production plant for <b>levulinic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E

Two {{series of}} black-colored {{macromolecular}} substances were respectively prepared by a) acid-catalyzed dehydration of pure glucose and b) dry-state heating of crystalline cellulose. For molecular characterization, these substances {{were analyzed by}} standard chemical and spectroscopic techniques, revealing {{a more or less}} smoothed carbohydrate signature. The pyrolysis results showed striking differences between the two series of carbohydrate-derived substances. The carbohydrate origin of the charred celluloses (even after 48 % wt loss) were evident by the characteristic cyclic ketones, alkylfuranes and the major peak of levoglucosan. The alkylbenzenes and aikylphenols were in comparatively low amounts. On the contrary, the acid-catalyzed dehydration substances, showed pyrolysis patterns where aromatic compounds (phenols, benzofurans, indenes, naphthalenes) dominate vs the infrequent furan peaks. The residual, acid-soluble, polyvinylpyrrolidone-retained fraction yielded furanes in addition to acetic and <b>levulinic</b> <b>acids.</b> The results obtained suggest that carbohydrate dehydration in media of intense ionic strength may lead to macromolecular material showing pyrolysis patterns compatible with the "carbohydrate-free" sedimentary macromolecules.

Other fatty acids were elaidic [(E) -octadec- 9 -enoic] acid (13. 9 %), stearic (octadecanoic) acid (12. 8 %) and linoleic [(9 Z, 12 Z) - 9, 12 -octadecadienoic] acid (10. 6 %). Of the 11 identified fatty acids, seven were saturated fatty acids, which represented 41. 5 % of total fatty acids, while unsaturated fatty acids altogether constituted 58. 5 %. In the cypselae of C. tomorosii, five fatty acids were identified. The major fatty acid was linolelaidic [(9 E, 12 E) -octadeca- 9, 12 -dienoic] acid (48. 8 %). The second most dominant fatty acid was oleic [(9 Z) -octadec- 9 -enoic] acid (34. 2 %). Thus, unsaturated fatty acids were present with 83 %.

The results showed that acids at moderate concentrations can stimulate the glycolytic flux, while higher levels of acid slow down the glycolytic flux for both aerobically and anaerobically grown yeast cells. In particular, the flux distribution between respiratory and fermentative growth was adjusted to achieve an optimal ATP generation to allow a maintained energy level as high as it is in nonstressed cells grown exponentially on glucose under aerobic conditions. In addition, yeast cells exposed to acids suffered from severe reactive oxygen species stress and depletion of reduced glutathione commensurate with exhaustion of the total glutathione pool.

Compared with low initial cell density, increasing initial cell density reduced the lag phase and improved the bioconversion yield of cinnamic acid during acid adaptation. In addition, yeast cells were able to grow at elevated concentrations of acid, probable due to the increase in phenotypic cell-to-cell heterogeneity in large inoculum size.

40|$|The {{downstream}} {{section of a}} lignocellulosic biochemical ethanolprocess produces a waste stream following the distillation of ethanol from thefermented syrup. This distillery wastewater, referred to as stillage, is a darkcolored, acidic, nutrient rich liquid that presents significant problems withits disposal. Unlike conventional distillery wastewater, this stillage maycontain recalcitrant products of biomass pretreatment. With US EPA tighteningthe industrial effluent discharge standards accompanied by decreasing landavailability for waste discharge, more intensive treatment approaches must beapplied to overcome stillage disposal issues. In this dissertation, an integrated system was developed totreat stillage produced from a sugarcane bagasse feedstock process.   The sugarcane bagasse is first pretreated ina dilute phosphoric acid process followed by enzymatic saccharification andthen fermentation.   The goals of theintegrated treatment system were to recover green {{energy in the form}} of biogas,recover nutrients, specifically phosphate via struvite precipitation, andfinally polish the effluent using advanced oxidation process to recover clean waterfor possible reuse in the ethanol plant. The aim of this integrated system wasto reduce the carbon and water foot print associated with the ethanolproduction process. Thermophilic anaerobic digestion (55 °C) of cellulosicethanol stillage was investigated using a 5. 5 L laboratory scale anaerobicfluidized bed reactor (AFBR). Batches of coarsely separated bagasse stillage(0. 425 mm sieve) obtained from the Biofuels pilot plant at the University ofFlorida with a high and variable soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) rangingfrom 11. 5 to 63 g sCOD/L was used as feed.  The AFBR was operated for 100 days.  The methane potential achieved was 12. 9 L CH 4 (L Stillage) - 10. 288 L CH 4 (g sCOD loaded) - 1. Solubleorganic matter removal efficiency of 93 % was achieved at a hydraulic retentiontime (HRT) of 7. 3 days and an organic loading rate of 6. 54 g sCOD L- 1 d- 1. The effluent soluble COD was 3. 5 g sCOD/L. Organic acids and sugars weremonitored periodically during the entire run. No external nutrients (N and P) were added during the operation of the fluidized bed reactor.   Typical dilute acid pretreatment productslike furfurals and <b>levulinic</b> <b>acids</b> found in the stillage were degraded in theAFBR.   Upon operating the AFBR at aloading rate of 8. 8 g sCOD L- 1 d- 1, volatile organic acids(especially propionic acid) accumulated and methane production wassuppressed.   These organic acids wereconsumed within {{a couple of days after}} turning off the feed.   Thereafter, the AFBR was operated at normaloperating conditions (6. 54 g sCOD L- 1 d- 1).   A novel sequential batch reactor (SBR) technology (withfill, react, settle, decant and drain phases) was used to precipitate andrecover phosphate from anaerobically digested stillage, in the form of the slowrelease fertilizer struvite.   The use ofcoarsely separated stillage solids as seed in the SBR to promote settling ofstruvite was investigated.   Resultsshowed that unseeded trials produced a large amount of unsettled fine mineralprecipitates, while using 1 % (wet w/v) stillage solids as seed materialimproved settleability of processed sludge. More than 95 % of settling occurredwithin the first 15 minutes of undisturbed settling following the 30 minreaction time. About 99. 9 % and 56 % of orthophosphate-phosphorous andammonia-nitrogen, respectively, were recovered in the sludge.   Seeding also increased the yield of netamount of settled struvite precipitate-containing sludge by 63 %. The struvite-containingsettled sludge was also tested for its agronomic applicability and nutrientleachability. Results showed markedly improved nutrient uptake by plants andreduced N and P levels in leachate on application of settled sludge as soilamendment for cultivation of sweet sorghum. Anaerobically digested and struvite precipitated effluentwas then subjected to photocatalytic oxidation to decolorize and reduce organicmatter further.   Photocatalytic oxidationwas carried out using TiO 2 coated reusable sheets (TiO 2 loading: 3 mg/cm 2).    Batch experiments were performed to study theeffect of initial soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD), depth, pH, lightsource and silver doping of TiO 2 catalyst on decolorization andorganic matter removal. Organic concentration of 3500 mg sCOD/L in anaerobicallydigested effluent was an obstacle for efficient photocatalytic treatment.   It was shown that dilution of this effluentdid not enhance photocatalytic degradation.  However, after reducing the soluble COD by biological aerobic treatment organicmatter removal, decolorization was enhanced.  The extent of decolorization was 91. 3 %, 91. 5 % and 77 % after 22, 55 and 80. 5 hours for 1, 3 and 5 mm depths, respectively, at neutral pH. The final treatedsCOD was 80 mg/L.   Significantdecolorization was observed only after the sCOD dropped below 600 mg/L duringtreatment. There was very little decolorization (~ 25 %) at pH of 9 or above. First order rate constants were determined to compare the kinetics of thephotodegradation process. Undoped TiO 2 with UV-A lamp and silverdoped TiO 2 with UV-C lamp had the highest first order rateconstants; 0. 087 h- 1 and 0. 063 h- 1, respectively.   Correspondingly 94 %, 99 % decolorization, and 82 %, 91 % COD removal was attained after 41 and 59 hours of exposure. A mass and energy balance was developed for a 1 milliongallon ethanol plant using sugarcane bagasse as feedstock. The results showedbiogasification of stillage produces enough biogas to meet the energy demandsin the plant for steam generation and the excess may be used to produceelectricity. Phosphates recovered from the process as struvite are enough tosupply ~ 43 % of the fertilizer needs to cultivate sugarcane for bagasseproduction. And finally polishing the wastewater provides a means for recyclingwater in the plant. This might help reduce the dependence of bioethanol plantson ground water resources...|$|R
