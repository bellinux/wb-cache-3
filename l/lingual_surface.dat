2500|$|The {{oropharynx}} {{lies between}} the mouth (oral cavity) to the front, and the laryngopharynx below, which [...] separates {{it from the}} larynx. The upper limit of the oropharynx is marked by the soft palate, and its lower limit by the epiglottis and root of the tongue. The oropharynx communicates with the mouth, in front through {{what is known as}} the oropharyngeal isthmus, or isthmus of the fauces. The isthmus (i.e. connection) is formed above by the soft palate, below by the posterior third of the tongue, and at the sides by the palatoglossal arches. The posterior third of the tongue, or tongue base contains numerous follicles of lymphatic tissue that form the lingual tonsils. Adjacent to the tongue base, the <b>lingual</b> <b>surface</b> of the epiglottis, which curves forward, is attached to the tongue by median and lateral glossoepiglottic folds. The folds form small troughs known as the epiglottic valleculae. The lateral walls are marked by two vertical pillars on each side, the pillars of the fauces, or palatoglossal arches. More properly they are separately named the palatoglossal arch anteriorly and the palatopharyngeal arch posteriorly. The anterior arch is named from the palatoglossal muscle within, running from the soft palate to the tongue [...] (glossus), while the posterior arch similarly contains the palatopharyngeal muscle running from the soft palate to the lateral pharynx. Between the arches lies a triangular space, the tonsillar fossa in which lies the palatine tonsil, another lymphoid organ.|$|E

5000|$|A {{cingulum}} is a convexity mesiodistally {{resembling a}} girdle, encircling the <b>lingual</b> <b>surface</b> at the cervical third, {{found on the}} <b>lingual</b> <b>surface</b> of anterior teeth.

[...] The majority of a lingual surface's cervical third is made up of the cingulum. [...] On lower incisors, a cingulum usually is poorly developed or absent.

40|$|BACKGROUND: (I) Introducing an {{intraoral}} {{camera system}} with a special positioner to allow computer-based analysis of reproducible images on <b>lingual</b> tooth <b>surfaces</b> and (II) comparing plaque removal by three manual toothbrushes with different brushhead designs (convex, multilevel and flat trimmed) on <b>lingual</b> mandibular tooth <b>surfaces.</b> METHOD: In a clinical single-blind, crossover, 24 -h plaque-regrowth study on 25 subjects, a computer-based index (PPI) {{was used to evaluate}} pre- and postbrushing plaque on <b>lingual</b> <b>surfaces</b> of mandibular premolars and molars. Subjects brushed their teeth under standardized conditions at three visits, each time with a different, randomly assigned toothbrush. RESULTS: The intraoral camera system allowed a reproducible and relatively convenient access to the <b>lingual</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the mandibular teeth and provided an increase in objectivity. Overall, each brush achieved statistically significant plaque removal, however, none reached clinical relevance. The multilevel brush was superior at specific sites, but failed to show statistically significant superiority in terms of overall plaque reduction. Without regard of the toothbrush used, the right handed subjects were less efficient in removing plaque from the right side compared to the left. CONCLUSIONS: The method is able to detect even small differences in plaque reduction. None of the different brushhead designs was able to compensate an insufficient brushing techniques...|$|R

40|$|Background and aims. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of different etching times on enamel color stability after immediate versus delayed exposure to colored artificial saliva (CAS). Materials and methods. Human first premolars were divided into five groups of twenty. A colorimeter was used according to the CIE system on the mid-buccal and mid-lingual surfaces to evaluate initial tooth color. Samples in group A remained unetched. In groups B to E, buccal and <b>lingual</b> <b>surfaces</b> were initially etched with phosphoric acid for 15 and 60 seconds, respectively. Then, the samples in groups A and C were immersed in colored artificial saliva (cola+saliva). In group B, the teeth were immersed in simple artificial saliva (AS). Samples in groups D and E were immersed in AS for 24 and 72 hours, respectively before being immersed in colored AS. The teeth were immersed for one month in each solution before color measurement. During the test period, the teeth were retrieved from the staining solution and stored in AS for five minutes. This was repeated 60 times. Color changes of buccal and <b>lingual</b> <b>surfaces</b> were calculated. Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests were used for statistical analysis (Î± â‰¤ 0. 05). Results. There were no significant differences between the groups in term of Î”E of buccal (P = 0. 148) and <b>lingual</b> <b>surfaces</b> (P = 0. 73). Conclusion. Extended time of etching did not result in significant enamel color change.

40|$|Orthodontic {{treatment}} with fixed appliances {{is considered a}} risk factor for the development of white spot caries lesions (WSL). Traditionally, brackets are bonded to the buccal <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Lingual</b> brackets are developing rapidly and have become more readily available. Buccal surfaces are considered to be more caries prone than <b>lingual</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Furthermore, <b>lingual</b> brackets are shaped to fit the morphology of the teeth and seal almost the entire surface. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that lingual brackets result in a lower caries incidence than buccal brackets. We tested this hypothesis using a split-mouth design where subjects were allocated randomly to a group receiving either buccal or lingual brackets on the maxillary teeth and the alternative bracket type in the mandible. The results indicate that buccal surfaces are more prone to WSL development, especially when WSL existed before treatment. The number of WSL that developed or progressed on buccal surfaces was 4. 8 times higher than the number of WSL that developed or progressed on <b>lingual</b> <b>surfaces.</b> When measured using quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF), the increase in integrated fluorescence loss was 10. 6 times higher buccally than lingually. We conclude that lingual brackets make a difference when caries lesion incidence is concerned...|$|R
