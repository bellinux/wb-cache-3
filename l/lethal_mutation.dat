Using the balancer nT 1 (IV;V), which suppresses recombination over 49 map units, 294 <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations</b> on LGIV(right) and LGV(left) were recovered using EMS mutagenesis. Twenty-six of these mutations fell into the unc- 22 region.

40|$|Mouse t haplotypes often carry {{embryonic}} <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations.</b> Sixteen complementation {{groups are}} known, but {{the viability of}} the heterozygotes between them is often less than 100 %. It has been reported that cis heterozygotes of two <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations</b> showed better viability than trans heterozygotes. This could indicate that the mutations were part of the same functional unit, even though they map up to 15 cM apart. However, the tw 5 and tw 12 haplotypes in our colony did not show a statistically significant decrease in viability when combined in trans. The cis-trans analysis was repeated using two independent chromosomes, derived by recombination between the tw 5 and the tw 12 haplotypes to provide the two <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations</b> in cis. Two independent chromosomes, representing the reciprocal recombination event, supplied the corresponding wild-type alleles in cis. These chromosomes were combined in the four pairwise combinations, and male/female reciprocal crosses were done. The cis heterozygotes showed a decrease, rather than an increase, in viability in seven of the eight cases. These results probably reflect effects of unrelated background genes. The <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations,</b> instead of being functionally related, may have occurred in a random, unrelated set of genes and may confer a selective advantage to t haplotypes found in wild populations...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to (1) {{characterize}} the 67 interval of chromosome 3 of Drosophila melanogaster genetically and (2) isolate mutations of the 67 B 1 small heat shock protein (hsp) gene cluster specifically, we undertook a mutational analysis of the 67 A-D subinterval. Using a deficiency of the 67 A 2 to 67 D 11 - 13 region, Df(3 L) AC 1, we screened 8700 diepoxybutane-treated chromosomes and 7800 ethyl methanesulfonate-treated chromosomes for visible and <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations</b> throughout this interval and recovered 74 independent recessive <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations,</b> but no visible mutations. One of the <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations,</b> d 29 A 6, was identified as an overlapping deficiency extending from 66 F 3 to 67 B 1. An additional 6000 diepoxybutane-treated chromosomes were screened for lethality over d 29 A 6, yielding another four <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations</b> within the 67 A 2 -B 1 subinterval. These 78 <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations,</b> along with two others isolated in other laboratories, define 23 essential loci [...] 6 within the 67 A 2 -B 1 subinterval and 17 within the 67 A 2 to D 11 - 13 subinterval.

Examination of the 67 A 2 -B 1 lethal complementation groups for (1) earlier onset of lethality following a heat shock, (2) missing or altered small hsps on two-dimensional protein gels, and (3) restoration of viability by transformed wild-type copies of the small hsp genes indicates {{that none of these}} mutations affect the small hsps.

5000|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which mutations cause lethality in Diptera in the developing zygote are well documented. [...] The primary lesion leading to a dominant <b>lethal</b> <b>mutation</b> is {{a break in the}} chromosome, in this case, induced by radiation. When a break is induced in a chromosome in mature sperm, it remains in this condition until after the sperm has entered an egg. Following fusion, nuclear divisions begin, and a break in a chromosome can have drastic effects on the viability of the embryo as development proceeds. During early prophase the broken chromosome undergoes normal replication, but during metaphase the broken ends can fuse leading to the formation of a dicentric chromosome and an acentric fragment. The acentric fragment is frequently lost, while the dicentric fragment forms a bridge at anaphase leading to another chromosomal break. This whole process then repeats itself, leading to the accumulation of serious imbalances in the genetic information of the daughter cells. The accumulation of this genetic damage finally leads to the death of the zygote).|$|E

The primary <b>lethal</b> <b>mutation</b> at 6 F 1 – 2 had occurred in an unstable chromosome (Uc) described previously (Lim 1979).

Two extragenic suppressors define a new gene, mei- 2. The suppressor mutations in these two genes also result in recessive maternal-effect lethality, but with meiotic rather than mitotic defects. Surprisingly, most of these suppressors are also able to suppress mel- 26 (ct 61) in addition to mei- 1 (ct 46).
