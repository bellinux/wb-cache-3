40|$|The {{correlations}} in dusty plasmas in {{the gaseous}} state is considered. It is {{shown that the}} <b>long-ranged</b> correlations of dust particles, contrary to usual matter, start to form in a weakly correlated state, leading finally {{to the formation of}} dust crystals and dust liquids with not strong but intermediate strength correlations. The physical mechanism leading to <b>long-ranged</b> correlations is the dust attraction due to shadow effects of the plasma particle fluxes. An analytic theory for the <b>long-ranged</b> dust density correlation function is developed and the numerical results for a broad range of dust densities and plasma temperatures are presented. The <b>long-ranged</b> correlations induced by dust for electron densities, ion densities, and dust charges are also investigated, and the results for electron density correlations are presented in a way that permits measurement of the <b>long-ranged</b> correlation function in laser and radio-wave scattering experiments...|$|R
40|$|Thermodynamic {{fluctuations}} in {{systems that are}} in nonequilibrium steady states are always spatially long ranged, in contrast to {{fluctuations in}} thermodynamic equilibrium. In the present paper we consider a fluid subjected to a stationary temperature gradient. Two different physical mechanisms have been identified by which the temperature gradient causes <b>long-ranged</b> fluctuations. One cause {{is the presence of}} couplings between fluctuating fields. Secondly, spatial variation of the strength of random forces, resulting from the local version of the fluctua-tion-dissipation theorem, has also been shown to generate <b>long-ranged</b> fluctua-tions. We evaluate the contributions to the <b>long-ranged</b> temperature fluctuations due to both mechanisms. While the inhomogeneously correlated Langevin noise does lead to <b>long-ranged</b> fluctuations, in practice, they turn out to be negligible as compared to nonequilibrium temperature fluctuations resulting from the coupling between temperature and velocity fluctuations.

40|$|Work {{fluctuations}} {{and work}} probability distributions are fundamentally different in systems with short- ranged versus <b>long-ranged</b> correlations. Specifically, in systems with <b>long-ranged</b> correlations the work distribution is extraordinarily broad compared to systems with shortranged correlations. This difference profoundly affects the possible applicability of fluctuation theorems like the Jarzynski fluctuation theorem. The Heisenberg ferromagnet, well below its Curie temperature, {{is a system}} with <b>long-ranged</b> correlations in very low magnetic fields due {{to the presence of}} Goldstone modes. As the magnetic field is increased the correlations gradually become short-ranged. Hence, such a ferromagnet is an ideal system for elucidating the changes of the work probability distribution as one goes from a domain with <b>long-ranged</b> correlations to a domain with short-ranged correlations by tuning the magnetic field. A quantitative analysis of this crossover behaviour of the work probability distribution and the associated fluctuations is presented...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{hydrodynamic}} theory of polar active smectics, for systems both {{with and without}} number conservation.

In d= 2 there is a Kosterlitz-Thouless type phase transition from the smectic phase to the ordered fluid phase driven by increasing the noise strength. For the number conserving case, we find that giant number fluctuations are greatly suppressed by the smectic order; that smectic order is <b>long-ranged</b> in d= 3; and that nonlinear effects become important in d= 2.

5|$|Like New World monkeys, strepsirrhines rely on scent marking {{for much}} of their communication.

Body postures and gestures may be used, although the long snout, non-mobile lips, and reduced facial enervation restrict the use of facial expressions in strepsirrhines. Short-range calls, <b>long-range</b> calls, and alarm calls are also used.
