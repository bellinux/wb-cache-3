5|$|The poem {{tells of}} the adventures of the title {{character}} and his sister Liénor. Guillaume is accepted at the court of Emperor Conrad who has {{fallen in love with}} Liénor despite his earlier aversion to <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>marriage.</b> Guillaume becomes one of the emperor's favorites and marriage negotiations proceed in a positive manner. The emperor's seneschal, however, discovers an intimate detail about Liénor's body and uses it to insinuate to the emperor and his court that she is no longer a virgin; the clever Liénor, with a ruse, proves his accusation false and marries the emperor.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{also uses}} sub-plots {{to offer a}} clearer view {{of the actions of}} the main characters. For example, when the play begins, Romeo is in love with Rosaline, who has refused all of his advances. Romeo's infatuation with her stands in obvious {{contrast}} to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet's <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>marriage.</b> Paris' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet's feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the sub-plot of the Montague–Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of hate that is the main contributor to the play's tragic end.|$|E

25|$|Moral aridity, the {{hypocrisy}} of contemporary life and the inability of people to find happiness in traditional ways such as <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>marriage</b> are the regnant themes {{in the works of}} Alberto Moravia. Usually, these conditions are pathologically typical of middle-class life; marriage is the target of works such as Disobedience and L'amore coniugale (Conjugal Love, 1949). Alienation is the theme in works such as Il disprezzo (Contempt or A Ghost at Noon. 1954) and La noia (The Empty Canvas) from the 1950s, despite observation from a rational-realistic perspective. Political themes are often present: an example is La Romana (The Woman of Rome, 1947), the story of a prostitute entangled with the Fascist regime and with a network of conspirators. The extreme sexual realism in La noia (The Empty Canvas, 1960) introduced the psychologically experimental works of the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Ruiz’s {{work does}} focus on race issues, {{considering}} she calls for “an essential Latin ‘difference,’ believing Latinos to be culturally and morally superior,” but her work also encompasses political issues. She warns against U.S. expansionism and corporate monopolies. For instance, in both her novels, she feminizes the male characters in order “to depict the subordinated status of those ‘handicapped’ by societal constraints”. These male characters are hurt by forces of decay and corruption. For example, in Squatter and the Don, the Californio men are victim to both illnesses and land loss {{because of the}} government. This novel centers on {{the corruption of the}} United States government due to the combination of capitalism with democracy. Ruiz paints the enemy here not to be the squatters, but the railroad barons. Even the Alamars and the Darrells, who in the end foster true <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>marriage</b> despite race, fall victim to the railroad barons.|$|E

500|$|Love in Several Masques is a {{traditional}} comic drama that incorporates morality. The theme of the play is the relationship of disguises and courtship {{with a discussion of}} the nature of love. Fielding focuses on men and how they deal with <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>marriage.</b> Also, the gentlemen must prove their worth before they can be justified in their marriage, which allows Fielding to describe the traits required in successful male suitors. The first act deals primarily with the gentlemen in order to establish a focus on their characteristics. Fielding's first play serves as a representation for his belief in the relationship of morality and libertine beliefs and introduces character types that he would use throughout his plays and novels. However, all negative characteristics are very apparent to the audience, and those characters who are immoral are unable to accomplish their goals. The main characters are still decent individuals who are able to help another, even though they sometimes get in each other's way. At no time is the audience able to believe that vice will conquer, which undermines part of the satire. Regardless, Harold Pagliaro is still able to conclude that [...] "Fielding's satire on the marriage market, however, is effective, if not biting." ...|$|E
500|$|Bookends {{contains}} many of Paul Simon's major themes, including [...] "youth, alienation, life, love, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality". Simon's work on Bookends is loosely autobiographical, designed {{to function as}} both a personal and artistic statement. Simon, [...] "feeling especially auteurist in the Dylan style of the day", had planned out the album's concept before he began writing, telling Garfunkel [...] "I'm going to start writing a whole side of an album—a cycle of songs. I want the early ones to be about youth and the last song to be about old age, and I want the feel of each song to fit." [...] Bookends, originally released primarily as a vinyl LP, opens and closes side one of the disc with the [...] "Bookends Theme", a brief acoustic piece (once compared to English rock band the Moody Blues) that evokes [...] "a time of innocence". [...] "Save the Life of My Child" [...] is a dramatic story involving drugs, violence and a mother and child relationship. According to James Bennighof, the song [...] "deals with individual crises in crowded urban settings, along with references to larger societal forces {{and at least a}} hint of some transcendent perspective". The song crossfades into [...] "America", which follows two young lovers—"an apparently impromptu romantic traveling alliance"—as they board a Greyhound bus [...] "to look for America". It is a protest song that [...] "creates a cinematic vista that tells of the singer's search for a literal and physical America that seems to have disappeared, along with the country's beauty and ideals". [...] "Overs" [...] includes themes regarding the disintegration of <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>marriage.</b> [...] "Old Friends" [...] paints a portrait of two old men reminiscing on the years of their youth. The two men [...] "sit on a park bench like bookends", and ponder how strange it feels to be nearing their lifetime. The song is joined with the [...] "Bookends Theme", this time with vocal accompaniment from the duo. The piece closes the entire suite with the [...] "resigned admonition" [...] to [...] "Preserve your memories / They're all that's left you".|$|E

2500|$|In Early Buddhism, the Sigalovada Sutta of the Digha Nikaya in the Pali Canon {{describes}} the respect {{that one is}} expected to give to one's spouse. However, since the ideal of Early Buddhism is renunciation, {{it can be seen}} from examples such as the story of the monk Nanda and his wife Janapada Kalyāni that striving for the [...] of Nirvana is valued above romantic <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>marriage.</b> Despite having married her just that day, encouraged by his cousin Gautama Buddha, Nanda left his wife to become a bhikkhu in the Buddhist Sangha. In stories like this from the Pali Canon, romantic love is generally perceived as part of attachment to samsara, the endless cycle of rebirth. Susan Murcott has pointed out that Early Buddhist attitudes to romantic <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>marriage</b> generally reflect the Brahmanic ideals of India at the time... including the recent rise of the renunciate ideal and the associated decline in the status of romantic <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>marriage.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The play's {{rejection}} by the Theatre Royal proved beneficial to Fielding because it {{allowed him to}} experiment with his plays {{in ways that would}} be unaccepted at larger locations.

Laurent-Perrier again took the lead in this area with advertisements touting their wine's favour with the Countess of Dudley, the wife of the 9th Earl of Stamford, the wife of the Baron Tollemache, and the opera singer Adelina Patti. Champagne labels were designed with images of romantic <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>marriage</b> as well as other special occasions that were deemed important to women, such as the baptism of a child.|$|E
