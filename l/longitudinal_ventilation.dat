40|$|The {{approach}} to tunnel ventilation system design {{has been a}} controversy for engineers for many years. The present methodologies and criteria used for quantifying the capacity of emergency tunnel ventilation in tunnel fire scenarios are mostly based on a simple empirical method or one-dimensional fluid dynamics network model. Due to the simple formulation of these methodologies, detailed dynamic flow behaviour of hot smoke from a tunnel fire at any location, which might cause the onset of backlayering, could not be predicted. To overcome this concern, a basic analysis of the complex phenomenon between ambient and hot smoke laden air in {{the proximity of the}} fire is required. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique, which has been well-established and applied in the design of building ventilation systems, enables the prediction of fundamental field variables of pressure, velocities, temperature and smoke concentration at any location within the computational domain of the system being simulated. Due to the unique environment inside the tunnel, validation of simulation results {{is one of the most}} important issues in applying the CFD technique as a design tool for quantifying the capacity of emergency tunnel ventilation system. This paper describes the CFD simulations of different fire scenarios in a road tunnel. Simulation results are compared with the results obtained from a series of full-scale fire tests conducted in an abandoned road tunnel in the USA, known as the Memorial Tunnel Fire Ventilation Test Program. Backlayering and critical velocity will be addressed and comparison of results obtained from the CFD technique and the traditional design method using empirical equations will be made.

30|$|In recent years, a {{comprehensive}} theory on tunnel fire dynamics {{has started to}} develop. Fire parameters such as the temperature development, flame length, backlayering, visibility and gas concentrations can be calculated for tunnels with longitudinal air flow (Ingason et al. 2015; Ingason 2012, 2008). In tunnels with <b>longitudinal</b> or natural <b>ventilation</b> there is an air flow along the tunnel due to static and dynamic pressure differences. Transversal ventilation systems have air inlets and outlets along the tunnel length. With some minor modifications or limitations, {{a large part of}} the theory will also apply for tunnels with transversal ventilation. When a fire develops, buoyancy forces make the hot gases rise and spread along the ceiling depending on the tunnel inclination and initial ventilation. Depending on the air flow speed, the hot smoke and cold air mix and the smoke eventually becomes homogenously distributed in the cross-section downstream the fire. The first tunnel fire science study was performed by Thomas (1958) to study the effect of backlayering, when hot smoke travels upstream along the ceiling against the air flow, see Figure  1. Later Thomas (1968) introduced the concept of a critical air velocity needed to prevent backlayering. The critical air velocity will increase with the heat release rate (HRR) towards a constant value at around 3  m/s for most tunnels (Ingason 2008; Ingason 2012). The fire generates a resistance that increases with the fire size, called the throttling effect. Therefore, although 3  m/s will be sufficient to resist backlayering, the fan capacity has to be increased for increasing fire sizes (Vaitkevicius et al. 2014).|$|R

In particular, has been detected that the building acts with a behaviour typically defined as "greenhouse effect", which determines high values of temperature and humidity content, in absence of a correct <b>longitudinal</b> and transverse <b>ventilation.</b> The research was aimed to study all the failures and pathologies and to identify design solutions to improve the performance of the thermo-hygrometric and internal ventilation of the building, and in general the conditions of the microclimate, in order to ensure a condition of comfort to the users and to ensure, at the same time, a suitable air quality for the preservation of fruit and vegetables.

40|$|The 2, 7 km long Saukopf-tunnel in Weinheim (Germany) is {{operated}} with bidirectional traffic and ventilated using a transverse ventilation system. This incorporates a continuous smoke extraction that enables {{to extract the}} smoke over the half or the entire tunnel length. In addition, the vitiated tunnel air can be extracted {{from the middle of}} the tunnel using the point extraction that can also perform smoke extraction. Due to the enforcement of the new German guideline on tunnel equipment of road tunnels (RABT- 2003 [1]), the ventilation system has to be upgraded in order to cater for the more onerous requirements for the fire case. The distributed smoke extraction is to be replaced with localised smoke extraction using remote controlled dampers. Furthermore during the smoke extraction, a control of the longitudinal flow is recommended. In this tunnel with bidirectional traffic, the most efficient smoke extraction is obtained, if the smoke is extracted such that air flows equally from both sides of the fire towards the extraction point situated above the fire. In order to enable a regulation of the <b>longitudinal</b> flow, new <b>ventilation</b> systems typically use jet fans. However due to civil constraints, this would be difficult to realize for this tunnel and consequently alternatives have been considered. One method is to enable air supply as well as extraction at the current middle extraction point. Furthermore, when smoke is extracted in one half of the tunnel, fresh air could be supplied in the other half. With these means, the flow velocity at the location of the fire can be influenced favourably.

40|$|In recent years, {{a number}} of high profile {{accidental}} fires have occurred in several road and rail tunnels throughout the world. Many of these fires grew rapidly to catastrophic size and claimed many lives. The processes involved in the rapid growth and extremely severe of these fires are not adequately understood as yet. The introduction to this thesis reviews {{a number of}} these accidental fires and describes much of the previous experimental research which has brought about the current understanding of tunnel fire behaviour. A detailed review of the relevant parts of elementary fire dynamics is also presented. This thesis addresses two main questions: 1. What is the influence of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>ventilation</b> on fire size in tunnels? and 2. What is the influence of tunnel geometry on fire size? The answers to both these questions are determined using a probabilistic method called Bayes Theorem. This provides a method of answering the above two questions using the handful of experimental data which are available. It is found that the heat release rate (HRR) of a heavy goods vehicle (HGV) fire may be greatly increased in magnitude by <b>longitudinal</b> <b>ventilation,</b> for example by about a factor of 5 with a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>ventilation</b> velocity of 3 ms- 1. It is also found that <b>longitudinal</b> <b>ventilation</b> may cause {{a significant increase in the}} HRR of large pool fires, but may cause a decrease in the HRR of small pool fires and car fires. An equation is derived to predict the influence of tunnel geometry on HRR. It is found that HRR varies principally with the width of the tunnel and the width of the fire object.

40|$|Despite the {{relative}} recent move towards inherent safe materials, the relentless drive of consumerism requires increased quantities of dangerous goods to be manufactured, transported, stored and used year on year. The {{safety and effectiveness}} of road transport systems is {{to be considered a}} strategic goal in particular in those countries, like Italy, in which 80 % of goods are transported by this means. Heavy good traffic by road has continually increased over many years and owing to population or environmental impact reasons, the actual number of road tunnels has grown in many countries. It must however be remarked that, due to the sharp reduction of vehicle pollutant emissions, the ventilation of road tunnel is more and more determined by the need of controlling smoke in case of fire. In case of fire in a tunnel, a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>ventilation</b> system is often operated in order to create, upstream of the fire, a smokeless area, essential for evacuation and rescue operations. If the ventilation rate is low, the fire smoke may propagate also upstream of the fire, contrary to the ventilation air flow, a phenomenon known as backlayering. The critical velocity, that is the minimum value capable of avoiding backlayering and thus force smoke to move only downstream, is obviously a fundamentally important value when designing ventilation systems. Therefore, the basic scientific problem is to determine the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>ventilation</b> rate necessary to prevent the combustion products from moving upstream of the fire. Current methods for determination of such value are based on semi-empiric equations, obtained by the Froude’s number conservation, combined with experimental data. The first step of this research was carried out on a real scale in order to simulate the evolving scenarios following an accident with fire development. Experimental runs were carried out with real fire development, utilizing alternatively different combustion materials and cars, focusing attention on longitudinal and transverse temperature gradients both in presence and in absence of fire-extinguishing automatic systems and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>ventilation</b> equipment.

Several experiments were carried out, considering a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>ventilation</b> system and realizing fires characterized by different heat/smoke flow rates. The asymptotic value of the critical ventilation velocity resulting by mathematical modelling appears in good agreement with those proposed by other authors. Combining the results of full scale and laboratory tests, practical recommendations are drawn concerning, from one side, general measures relating to the tunnel and the traffic (e. g. ventilation design and operation), on the other side specific measures to reduce the consequence of accidents and implement emergency response management...|$|E
40|$|Smoke back-layering flow {{length is}} {{the length of}} the {{reversed}} smoke flow upstream of the fire when the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>ventilation</b> velocity is lower than the critical velocity. This paper experimentally investigates the smoke back-layering flow length of longitudinal ventilated tunnel fires with a vertical shaft in the upstream (0. 5 - 4. 0 m from the fire source) using a 1 / 10 reduced-scale subway tunnel model. Experimental results show that the vertical shaft in the upstream can control the smoke back-layering flow length within a relatively limited range, compared to the tunnel without vertical shaft. Moreover, for the cases that the fire source is not located exactly below the vertical shaft, the most appropriate dimensionless distance between the vertical shaft and fire source is 3, resulting in the shortest smoke back-layering flow length. By introducing a concept of virtual fire source below vertical shaft, a new empirical model was further deduced to predict the smoke back-layering flow length. Its predictions fit reasonably well when the dimensionless longitudinal flow velocity is less than 0. 19.

The critical velocities for preventing back-layering for tilted tunnels are higher than the values required for horizontal tunnels. However, a corrected empirical formula for critical velocity in a tilted tunnel is proposed based on the experimental and numerical results. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
