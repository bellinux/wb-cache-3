6000|$|... "Can't {{get away}} from <b>your</b> <b>moral</b> bias, eh?--Well, well. We'll go into all that. But apart from its moral merits--simply as an artistic trick--it was not bad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir, for <b>your</b> <b>moral</b> lessons," [...] said Lillie, {{turning her}} back on him defiantly, putting {{her feet on the}} fender, and going on with her reading.|$|R
6000|$|Your logic, my friend, is perfect, [...] <b>Your</b> <b>moral</b> most drearily true; But, {{since the}} earth clashed on her coffin, [...] I keep hearing that, and not you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. I {{will do the}} talking, but I shall {{depend upon}} <b>your</b> <b>moral</b> support. We will go over to Somerville to-morrow afternoon. We had better not lose any time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Sitting up {{watching}} alone made me all nerves for you, {{and instead of}} going to bed when it got light I started. And now you won't frighten me like this again about <b>your</b> <b>morals</b> for nothing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{no voice}} or {{authority}} in the matter," [...] Norbanus said calmly. [...] "Legal right to interfere you never had. <b>Your</b> <b>moral</b> right you have forfeited. The conditions have been signed. Aemilia is betrothed to Beric." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They wouldn't {{listen to}} me. They {{said you had}} better be engaged. They thought it would benefit <b>your</b> <b>morals.</b> I was very much against it. I think boys are so much nicer when they haven't got encumbrances--or morals." ...|$|R
6000|$|CHARTERIS. Come, Julia: {{you don't}} {{expect me to}} admire you for <b>your</b> <b>moral</b> qualities, do you? (She turns and looks hard at him. He starts up apprehensively and backs away from her. She rises and follows him up slowly and intently.) ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why {{are you so}} indignant! Anyone {{would think}} <b>your</b> <b>moral</b> self had been outraged! Why take it morally? You petrify that man at the inn by the very way you speak to him, such condemnation! Why don't you take it as it comes? It's all life." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why then I'll do {{what you}} want. We needn't, I grant you, in that case wait; and I can {{see what you mean}} by {{thinking}} it nicer of us not to. I don't even ask you," [...] she continued, [...] "for a proof. I'm content with <b>your</b> <b>moral</b> certainty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] His {{voice sounded}} rather doubtful. [...] "The fact is, Bertie, it doesn't look quite right to me.

6000|$|But I {{know your}} primary fundamentals, they are your first {{principles}} of morals; not {{faith in the}} righteousness of Christ, for that is comprehended in your positive, and in themselves indifferent things: <b>your</b> <b>morals</b> are the things in themselves absolutely necessary; of an indispensable and eternal obligation (p. 8,9).

6000|$|Dear Bruner, {{once we had}} {{a little}} talk [...] (That is to say, 'twas I did all the talking) About the manner of <b>your</b> <b>moral</b> walk: [...] How devious the trail you made in stalking, On level ground, your law-protected game-- [...] "Another's Dollar" [...] is, I think, its name.|$|R

6000|$|Oh! woman, woman, {{what are}} ye not, when duly {{protected}} {{and left to}} the almost divine impulses of your generous natures! What may ye not become, when rendered mercenary and envious by too close a contact with those worldly interests which are never admitted to an ascendancy without destroying all <b>your</b> <b>moral</b> beauty! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't think <b>your</b> <b>moral</b> is very clear," [...] said Mr. Morris, [...] "for {{it would}} have been about as bad for the 'possum one way as the other. But, after all, {{it would have}} been better for the little beast to tell the truth and die with a clear conscience." ...|$|R
50|$|Your hands {{have made}} me and {{fashioned}} me: give me understanding and I shall <b>learn</b> <b>your</b> commandments.|$|R
60|$|Oh, I suppose you're {{shocked and}} scandalised. I {{ought to go}} on posing. I ought to act the part decently to the end. You would never have {{had the courage to}} do what I did, and yet, because I've failed, you think you can look down on me from the height of <b>your</b> <b>moral</b> elevation.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come, sir,' {{returned}} his father, raising himself {{a little on}} the sofa, and looking straight towards him; 'we have had enough of this. Remember, if you please, your interest, <b>your</b> duty, <b>your</b> <b>moral</b> obligations, <b>your</b> filial affections, and all that sort of thing, which it is so very delightful and charming to reflect upon; or you will repent it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As I suspected," [...] said Smith, [...] "but we {{must not}} repine. These trifling contretemps are the {{penalties}} we pay for our high journalistic aims. I fancy that {{with the aid of}} the diplomatic smile and the honeyed word I may manage to win out. Will you come and give me <b>your</b> <b>moral</b> support, Comrade Brown?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a row about nothing!" [...] said Mr. Bonteen, {{rising from}} his seat. [...] "We were {{speaking}} {{of a very}} pretty woman, and I was saying that some young fellow generally supposed to be fond of pretty women would soon be after her. If that offends <b>your</b> <b>morals</b> you must have become very strict of late." ...|$|R
60|$|There is {{only one}} {{pleasure}} higher than that, {{and that is to}} get outside and break the vow.

5000|$|Before {{her role}} as Babe Carey Chandler on All My Children, Havins was a {{professional}} dancer. She changed her focus to acting, carrying a principle with her: [...] "Always hold on to <b>your</b> <b>morals</b> and values because this business can be very deceiving. I turned down {{a lot of things}} because there was nudity required," [...] she said.|$|R
500|$|Andrew Garfield {{believes}} {{the story of}} Never Let Me Go is about humans, and exploring [...] "what {{it is to have}} a soul, and how you prove what a soul is"; he says he enjoys the way the film is a [...] "call to arms" [...] about the positives of life. He adds that its message could hopefully remind people that they have a choice when they arise in the morning whether to pursue their own choice of activities for the day, or to do what they should do or are obliged to do. Keira Knightley feels that the film's story is alarming, but has said that the film is [...] "more about humanity's ability to look the other way". [...] "You know in fact that if <b>your</b> <b>morals</b> can go out the window if you think you can survive in a certain way, whatever <b>your</b> <b>morals</b> may be".|$|R
