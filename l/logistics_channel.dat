40|$|AbstractThis paper {{suggests}} {{the important role}} of trust as a governance mechanism for the successful <b>logistics</b> <b>channel.</b> Two types of the circulated logistics channels are discussed. The first is the recycle channel, where an actor (a firm) can govern total channel and its flow. In this channel, an actor bears the role of entrance and exit, and processes goods, resources, and waste. It may be called as the closed circulated <b>logistics</b> <b>channel.</b> The second is the recycle channel of kitchen garbage, which is governed by plural actors, such as firms, consumers, and governments, based on trust. This channel may be called as the open circulated <b>logistics</b> <b>channel...</b>|$|E

30|$|The final {{research}} task set for {{the paper}} was defined as “to provide a clarification on how the SSS impacts the logistics costs to main markets”. In order to answer this Fig.  5 explains the distribution of different costs elements in relation overall costs. The study results imply that the manufacturing units located behind sea transport routes must continuously plan and negotiate with logistics service providers about possible improvements of logistics technologies. The exported volumes are so large that the <b>logistics</b> <b>channel</b> must continuously function properly. The production units far from markets are often under closer and critical look {{from the perspective of}} the firm management. Affordable manufacturing locations are often relatively close to buyers. However, during the latest decades, efficiency of logistics has developed tremendously. Large container ships that carry up to 18, 000 – 22, 000 TEU have clearly reduced transport unit costs in over sea routes. Accordingly, SSS cargo shipping in Europe provides effective ways for remote companies to stay in business.|$|E
40|$|An {{economic}} {{optimization model}} of waterborne containerized imports from Asia to the USA is described. Imports are allocated to alternative ports and <b>logistics</b> <b>channels</b> {{so as to}} minimize total transportation and inventory costs for each importer. <b>Logistics</b> <b>channels</b> include direct shipment of marine containers via truck or rail, and trans-loading in the hinterlands of the ports of entry from marine containers into domestic trailers or containers. The model was exercised with 2004 actual transportation costs, import volumes and declared values, plus a range of hypothetical container fees assessed on imports routed via the San Pedro Bay Ports. The results show that, without reductions in container movement lead times, container fees would result in significant diversion of cargoes to other ports. In contrast, if infrastructure is improved such that container movement lead times are significantly reduced, the model predicts little or no decrease in overall imports via San Pedro Bay but {{a substantial increase in}} trans-loaded imports for fees ranging up to $ 200 per container. ...|$|R

40|$|Shipments of {{container}} imports {{are heavily}} concentrated {{in a number}} of ports, which has resulted in pressures on logistics networks. Partly in response to such pressures, several new routes are being developed to gain access to US markets. One involves the port of Prince Rupert; the other is the expansion of the Panama Canal. The {{purpose of this article is}} to estimate prospective traffic flows through these <b>logistics</b> <b>channels</b> for container shipments to US markets. An optimization model is developed that accounts for congestion and demand uncertainty. It determines the optimal route, ship size, port and hinterland shipping channels based on cost minimization. Our results show that inter-port competition is very intense. Prince Rupert can become an important rival of US ports and routes and the expansion of the Panama Canal can have similar impacts. ...|$|R

The reverse <b>logistics</b> <b>channel</b> in supply chain context used for {{recycling}} {{differs from the}} forward flow logistics in many sub-areas. The objective of this thesis {{is based on the}} reverse <b>logistics</b> <b>channel</b> in supply chain context, which mainly focuses on several primary processes related with collection and sorting of solid waste, packaging, in relation to 4 R’s strategy, which includes reduce, reuse, recycle and recover. The rapidly increasing of the population and industrial manufacturing, as well as an increasing of the consumption leading to an increasing of solid waste generation in Bangkok, Thailand. This is the challenge for us to find potential improvements to increase the recycle rate, reduced the contamination problems so that material recovery rate should be increase. This also results in saving national resources and energy from producing products from virgin material. However, the scope of this paper is in collection and sorting areas of waste material. Collection and sorting of waste material at Eskilstuna Energi & Miljö has been practiced from many years and continuously improving according to their yearly development plans. We reviewed the process in EEM as a model process for our research in comparison with municipal solid waste management in Bangkok, Thailand. The analysis and comparison between collection and sorting process in Eskilstuna Energi & Miljö and in Bangkok, Thailand, which reflects the strong points of the collection and sorting system at EEM in Sweden to apply in the improvement step in the weak points of system in Thailand. The comparison based on benchmarking methodology, which focus on four major areas including waste containers, collection, sorting and transportation. The conclusion includes the potential improvements in the current process in Thailand will be presented at the end. In this part we further divide it into two steps i-e short and long term improvements, which make the authorities, acts more specific in certain ways. We suggest a proposed layout of solid waste management in Thailand in the end according to the improvements. The suggestions for improvement plan are finalized in this area. The main purpose is to realize and contribute realize continuous improvement in the existing process of sorting and collection in Bangkok.   Keywords: Recycling, Reverse logistics, Supply chain, 4 R, Collection, Sorting, Waste. ...|$|E
40|$|Biotech grains hold {{great promise}} for both {{producers}} and consumers but {{a thorough understanding}} of the value chain will be vitally important in realizing that potential. Biotech grains with input traits not approved for all uses can pose a serious problem for the grain handling and processing industry as they move through the value chain. This problem occurs because there is no premium to cover added costs of segregation and handling input trait grains after harvest. In the case of Starlink the manufacturer is currently providing a defacto premium to producers and elevators to make the channeling effort effective. Output trait grains not approved for all uses may also create a problem if due care is not used. However the existence of a premium over the market price for commodity grain provides a positive incentive to create a separate and distinct <b>logistics</b> <b>channel</b> for these products. Experience with Starlink indicates that attempting to channel a product that is not acceptable for all uses without a premium can inflict significant uncompensated costs on the output side of the value chain. These costs may include market discounts and are typically incurred by firms who do not receive any meaningful gain from the sale of the trait. ...|$|E

Not only does it have an economic effect on the stakeholders in the container transport chain, but it also has an environmental and sustainability impact on the society since the reduction of empty container movements will reduce fuel consumption, and reduce congestion and emissions. This chapter first analyzes the main reasons that cause empty container repositioning. Secondly, we provide a literature review with the emphasis on modeling the ECR problem from the network scope, e. g. modeling ECR in seaborne transportation network, modeling ECR in inland or intermodal transportation network, and treating ECR as a sub-problem or a constraint under other decision-making problems. Thirdly, we discuss the solutions to the ECR problems from the <b>logistics</b> <b>channel</b> scope perspective, which are categorized into four groups including organizational solutions, intra-channel solutions, inter-channel solutions, and technological innovations. Fourthly, we discuss the solutions to the ECR problems from the modelling technique perspective, which includes two broad research streams: network flow models and inventory control-based models. We then present two specific models representing the above two research streams, which aim to tackle the ECR problems in stochastic dynamic environments considering both laden and empty container management...|$|E

30|$|Other {{studies have}} {{attempted}} formulating supply reliability as an allocation problem under the headings of Process Flexibility. Jordan and Graves (1995) put forward the “chain” concept, which they define as a bipartite network {{of products and}} plants. However, they model demand uncertainty, rather than supply, and model a chain where there is redundant capacity in plants for producing alternative products {{as a response to}} demand fluctuations. They model the excess capacity and cost trade off, proving that a small amount of redundant capacity can have the benefits of total flexibility. Graves and Tomlin (2003) then extend this work to supply chains that produce multiple products and have consistent findings. Jordan and Graves (1995)‘s work resulted in various analytical models. Many researchers created bottom up models, where uncertainty is modelled alongside inventory production flow parameters, and then addressed by redundant processes (Barad and Nof, 1997), capacity planning (Jordan and Graves 1995), or <b>logistics</b> <b>channels</b> (Barad 2003). In their review Stevenson and Spring (2007) argued that while these models provide useful insights, they have limited relevance to the more complex network structures found in practice.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{advent of}} grocery sales through online {{channels}} necessitates that bricks-and-mortar retailers redefine their logistics networks {{if they want}} to compete online. Because the general understanding of such bricks-and-clicks logistics systems for grocery is still limited, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the internal logistics networks used to serve customers across channels by means of an exploratory study with retailers from different contexts. Design/methodology/approach: A total of twelve case companies from six European countries participated in this exploratory study. Face-to-face interviews with managers were the primary source for data collection. The heterogeneity of our sample enabled us to build a common understanding of logistics networks in grocery retailing on multiple channels and to understand the advantages of different warehousing, picking, internal transportation and last-mile delivery systems. Findings: Bricks-and-mortar grocery retailers are leveraging their existing logistics structures to fulfill online orders. Logistics networks are mostly determined by the question of where to split case packs into customer units. In non-food <b>logistics</b> <b>channel</b> integration is mostly seen as beneficial, but in grocery retailing this depends heavily on product, market and retailer specifics. The data from our heterogeneous sample reveals six distinct types for cross-channel order fulfillment. Practical implications: Our qualitative analysis of different design options can serve as decision support for retailers developing logistics networks to serve customers across channels. Originality/value: The paper shows the internal and external factors that drive the decisionmaking for omni-channel logistics networks for previously store-based grocery retailers. Thereby it makes a step towards building a contingency and configuration theory of retail networks design. It discusses in particular the differences between grocery and non-food omni-channel retailing, lastmile delivery systems and market characteristics in the decision-making of retail networks design...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 39). Increased participation in world trade is conventionally seen as {{the single most important}} key to rapid economic growth and development of the developing countries. The combination of increased competition among developing countries to attract foreign direct investment as locations for labour-intensive processes, crowded markets for labour-intensive manufactures, weak growth and protectionist inclinations in the advanced industrial countries can mean that what might be good for an individual exporter might not be good for all exporters. This analysis poses the vitally important policy challenge of what developing countries, confronted by the vigorous expansion of their foreign trade but no comparable rise in income, should do. Prospects of instability and conflict in the Third World are one of the major challenges to international export-import security in the era. The challenge is hardly new or unexpected. In the recent era, Third World conflicts, intra-state, inter-state and regional, vastly outnumbered those occurring in the developed segment of the international trade system. But even {{as the end of the}} Cold War has been accompanied by the settlement of a number of long-standing regional conflicts, such as in Afghanistan, Southern Africa, Central America, Nigeria, Vietnam, Brazil and Cambodia, new anxieties about Third World conflicts and their wider geopolitical ramifications have emerged. From a business perspective, supply chain management is not primarily about development, but is one of the most basic strategies of business to deliver output efficiently. However, in recent decades, as companies have responded to increased pressure to demonstrate their contribution to society and economic development, supply chains have gained attention as a lever through which businesses can boost their development impact. Specially, the impact of global supply chain on the business of export-import is significantly high for its direct effect on the effectiveness of the business. The efficiency of supply chain depends on its logistics support as well as the continuous flow of the process. Any disruption between the logistics flow can destroy the whole business. The management of each and every supply chain should consider the emergency option while designing the whole process. The implementation of alternative <b>logistics</b> <b>channel</b> may need a lot of investment but the priority should be to run the economy fluently in crisis period. S. M. Aftatul AmanM.

40|$|An {{economic}} {{optimization model}} of waterborne containerized imports from Asia to the USA for a retailer is described. The retailer's imports are allocated to alternative ports and logistics channels {{so as to}} minimize total transportation and inventory costs. Goods may be shipped via the <b>logistics</b> <b>channel</b> of direct shipment of marine containers via truck or rail to retail distribution centers, or via transportation to cross-docking facilities in the hinterlands of the ports of entry and trans-loading goods from marine containers into domestic trailers or containers. A previous model has been built for a retailer employing a single optimal importing strategy, specifying the allocation of each retail distribution center to its optimal port of entry and the choice of direct shipment or trans-loading, uniformly applied across the importer's entire product portfolio. Here we describe a methodology to extend this model {{to allow for a}} retailer that can employ multiple optimal strategies, applied to different classes of goods within its product portfolio segmented by inventory holding cost rate. We find that for the retailer's cost minimization problem, it is provably optimal to generate sub-problems by splitting goods into consecutive valuation partitions. By doing so, the retailer's multi-strategy problem becomes computationally tractable. We examine the impact of less-than-container shipments on the optimal set of strategies. This allows us to more accurately estimate the transportation cost. We collected data, including origin-destination transportation rates and lead times, from a top five national big-box retailer to test both single and multiple strategy methodologies. Using these parameters, we found that our case study retailer could potentially reduce their total supply chain cost by over 2. 1 % by using an optimal single strategy, and over 2. 6 % by using different optimal strategies for the various goods in their portfolio. We then examine the optimal single strategy and set of multiple strategies for retailers of various importing volumes and declared goods valuation distributions. The optimal single strategy for a retailer generally shows direct shipping for the lowest value goods and lowest demand volume retailers, trans-loading at three to four ports for slightly higher value of goods and demand volume, and trans-loading at fewer and fewer ports as the good value and volume continue increasing. For our tested parameter set, the cost reduction generated by allowing multiple strategies for a single retailer can further reduce the total supply chain cost by up to 1 %. Lastly, we analyze the value of building redundancy into the supply chain to mitigate the cost of disruptions. We note that many retailers utilize more ports than our model would recommend as optimal. We have found that there is value in a retailer always utilizing at least two ports of entry to protect against supply chain disruptions at any single port. However, for those retailers whose optimal port usage already includes at least two ports, disruption mitigation would not provide enough benefit to justify the additional infrastructure investment. We hypothesize that there exist other factors such as institutional inertia and negotiation leverage that contribute to the use of these additional ports of entry...|$|E

This session will present a model for addressing business continuity and share various principles and effective practices obtained from in-depth case study research of leading-edge firms. The Opportunity. All business organizations {{are exposed to}} operational risk. Most managers, when they think about such risk, {{tend to focus on}} those risks that affect internal operations. Accidents, natural disasters, and intentional malicious acts all have the potential to seriously disrupt or shut down internal operations. While critical, all risks are not internal. Increasingly, as more firms begin to rely on the supply chain and the capabilities of their suppliers, managers and researchers are coming to realize the true impact of supply-side disruptions (Zsidisin, 2003; Barnes 2001; Gilbert and Gips 2000). Business failures, disruptions or shutdowns among a firm’s suppliers or in its inbound <b>logistics</b> <b>channels</b> can easily create a ripple effect of business interruptions throughout the supply chain. They can also seriously and strategically impact overall performance. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} a formalized system that identifies such risks, qualifies the associated risks and then provides procedures...|$|R

The Chinese did not provide North Korea with direct military support (other than <b>logistics</b> <b>channels)</b> until United Nations troops, largely US forces, had nearly reached the Yalu River late in 1950.

But in September, the North Koreans were driven back by the US-led counterattack that started with the UN landing in Incheon, followed by a combined South Korean-US-UN offensive from the Pusan Perimeter. North Korean history emphasizes that the United States had previously invaded and occupied the South, allegedly with the intention to push further north and into the Asian continent. Based on these assumptions, it portrays the KPA invasion of the South as a counter-attack. By October, UN forces had retaken Seoul and invaded the North to reunify the country under the South. On 19 October, US and South Korean troops captured P’yŏngyang, forcing Kim and his government to flee north, first to Sinuiju and eventually into Kanggye.|$|R

In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} choosing the appropriate reverse channel structure for the collection of used products from customers. Specifically, we consider a manufacturer who has three options for collecting such products: (1) she can collect them herself directly from the customers, (2) she can provide suitable incentives to an existing retailer (who already has a distribution channel) to induce the collection, or (3) she can subcontract the collection activity to a third party. Based on our observations in the industry, we model the three options described above as decentralized decision-making systems with the manufacturer being the Stackelberg leader. When considering decentralized channels, we find that ceteris paribus, the agent, who is closer to the customer (i. e., the retailer), is the most effective undertaker of product collection activity for the manufacturer. In addition, we show that simple coordination mechanisms can be designed such that the collection effort of the retailer and the supply chain profits are attained at the same level as in a centrally coordinated system. supply chain management, reverse <b>logistics,</b> remanufacturing, <b>channel</b> structure...|$|R

40|$|The {{corporate}} {{characteristics and}} competences of successful fashion retail businesses encompass both ‘back of house’ and ‘market facing’ capabilities including financial discipline, product design, supplier management and <b>logistics,</b> sales <b>channel</b> management, and marketing capabilities such as pricing and branding. It {{is clear that}} success in this market demands the development of both ‘back-of-house’ and ‘market-facing’ competences contributing to relationships extending up the supply chain to designer, supplier and manufacturer and down to distributor, retailer and consumer. The diversity of these relationships mean {{that they may be}} beyond the scope of one organization. Hence strategic alliances are commonly used throughout the fashion industry, most often supporting ‘back of house’ competences in the design, manufacturing or distribution of a completely new product line - for example a fashion brand introducing cosmetic and fragrance products. While such ‘back of house’ alliances are fairly well understood, alliances focused on ‘market facing’ competences such as branding, retailing and promotion are less well covered within the literature. Using the example of a successful alliance between two European fashion businesses to develop and promote a new branded product line in China, this paper explores the motivations for, processes involved in and potential outcomes of, market-facing alliances in the fashion retail sector. The presentation will contextualise this instance within the scope of the existing alliance literature and indicate characteristics which make the fashion retail sector distinctive within the topic area.

Because we focus on operational systems, we excluded literature that strictly covers general management, marketing and service management issues, and does not discuss logistical aspects at all. This literature mainly addresses customer behavior in multiple channels and the organizational relations between channels. Furthermore, due to the advent of online commerce in the late nineties, we limited the search to issues published after 2000. Although OC retailing has some features {{that are related to}} pure online retailing, we excluded literature from single-channel e-commerce, since it is unclear how the requirements for online retailing will apply to OC (see also Agatz et al. 2008; Brynjolfsson et al. 2013; Bell et al. 2014). Because we focus on non-food retailing, we also excluded papers restricted to food distribution. We used a qualitative content analysis to identify the conceptual content that is related to our field of research (Ryan and Bernard 2000; Seuring et al. 2005; Mayring 2011). Papers were assessed based on whether they address problems of physical product flows and/or operational <b>logistics</b> interfaces between <b>channels.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this survey}} chapter on pricing and {{reimbursement}} in U. S. pharmaceutical markets, we first provide background information on important federal legislation, institutional details regarding distribution <b>channel</b> <b>logistics,</b> definitions of alternative price measures, related historical developments, and reasons why price discrimination is highly prevalent among branded pharmaceuticals. We then present {{a theoretical framework}} for the pricing of branded pharmaceuticals, without {{and then in the}} presence of prescription drug insurance, noting factors affecting the relative impacts of drug insurance on prices and on utilization. With this as background, we summarize major long-term trends in copayments and coinsurance rates for retail and mail order purchases, average percentage discounts off Average Whole Price paid by third party payers to pharmacy benefit managers as well as average dispensing fees, and generic penetration rates. We conclude with a summary of the evidence regarding the impact of the 2006 implementation of the Medicare Part D benefits on pharmaceutical prices and utilization, and comment on very recent developments concerning the entry of large retailers such as Wal-Mart into domains traditionally dominated by large retail chains and the "commoditization" of generic drugs. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we analyse factors {{relevant}} for adopting multi-access technologies in online auction markets. Its focus is on how multi-access technologies, such as Web and Internet technologies, mobile and wireless technologies, and digital TV technologies are adopted in online consumer auction markets. From a literature review four factors were identified based on theories of online auction markets, channels in marketing and <b>logistics,</b> and communication <b>channels</b> and media features that could explain the adoption of multi-access technologies. The four factors are: perceived appropriateness of a given multi-access technology, media richness of various multi-access technologies, support of multiple modes of communication relationships, {{and the level of}} experience in using multiple marketing channels. We analysed five Finnish consumer auction markets: Huuto. Net, Keltainen Pörssi, QXL Finland, Systeemi. Net, and Tori. Our analysis of five Finnish online auctions shows that the Internet and World Wide Web are the predominant [...] and in most cases the only [...] online access technology available to the users. Furthermore, not even the Web-technologies are used to their full potential. Our paper suggests that media richness and the ability to provide multiple modes of communication relationships stimulate the adoption of multi-access technologies. Conclusions are presented and implications are drawn for future research. Online auction markets Multi-access technologies Marketing channels Media richness Digital TV Mobile data services...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} the cola market situation in Thailand {{and the possibility of}} a local brand to compete with global brands. Due to the high value of this market, every cola company wants to get the biggest piece of the market share pie. Moreover, there is a situation regarding a global cola brand Pepsi falling into the trouble in terms of <b>logistics</b> and distribution <b>channels</b> after having been separated from its local partner company. In addition, Pepsi’s ex-partner company has launched a new cola brand into the market, a completely separate operation without any ties to Pepsi. As a result, the cola market in Thailand now has witnessed fierce competition and it attracts many players in the beverage industry to take part. Therefore, this research is designed to understand the brand preference, brand substitution, brand loyalty, taste preference, and relation between several factors from customers’ perspective to answer the possibility of a local brand competing with global brands, as well as {{to investigate}} the general cola market situation.   Information was collected by questionnaire which was answered by 420 participants, 51 percent of which were female and 49 percent were male. The results of the questionnaire found that their brand preference is actually in an opposite direction with the current cola market share, due to the effect of cola brand substitution in the market. Moreover, the research found that taste preference and gender have an influence on brand preference, while frequency of drinking and other demographics do not have any effect on brand preferenc...|$|R
