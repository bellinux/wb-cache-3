5|$|The Middle Devonian {{is divided}} into three main groups. The <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequence, mostly Eifelian in age, is {{dominated}} by lacustrine beds of the lower and upper Stromness Flagstones that were deposited in Lake Orcadie. The later Rousay flagstone formation is found throughout much of the North and South Isles and East Mainland.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lower</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills are {{composed}} of grassland and thicket, while above roughly 1800 metres is dominated by montane forest. The forest contains Neoboutonia macrocalyx, Tabernaemontana stapfiana, Prunus africana, Strombosia scheffleri, Cassipourea malonsana, Olea capensis and Ilex mitis. Some isolated parts are dominated by Erythrina abyssinica. <b>Lower</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest are dominated either by Juniperus procera or Commiphora baluensi.|$|R

It is also called the cardiac sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter, named from the adjacent part of the stomach, the cardia. Dysfunction of the gastroesophageal sphincter causes gastroesophageal , which causes heartburn and if it happens often enough, can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease, with damage of the esophageal mucosa.|$|E
