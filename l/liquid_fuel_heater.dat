40|$|Future regulations, {{such as the}} ultra low {{emissions}} vehicle (ULEV) {{specified by}} the California Air Resources Board (CARB), are placing stricter limits on the allowable hydrocarbon (HC) emissions and make {{the understanding of the}} sources of HC emissions of considerable importance. Previous researchers have identified six sources of hydrocarbon emissions: oil layers, deposits, <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel,</b> quenching, crevices, and exhaust valve leakage. The objective of this research was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> contribution to hydrocarbon emissions.

40|$|This {{computational}} {{study examines}} {{the effect of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> depth on flame spread across propanol pools with and without forced, opposed air flow. The initial pool temperature is below its closed- cup flash point temperature T(sub cc); so the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> must be heated sufficiently to create a combustible mixture of fuel vapor before ignition and flame spread can occur. Furthermore, {{in order for the}} flame to spread, an approximate rule is that the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> surface temperature ahead of the flame must be heated above T(sub cc) so that a flammable mixture just above the lean limit exists ahead of the flame. The depth of a <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> pool would affect the heating of the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> pool and thus the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> surface temperature ahead of the flame. It has been observed experimentally and numerically that, at normal gravity without forced gas-phase flow and with the initial pool temperature T(sub 0) in a range well below T(sub cc), the flame periodically accelerates and decelerates (pulsates) as it propagates. The depth of a <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> pool would change this range of T(sub 0) since it would affect the heating of the pool...|$|R

Moreover, the heat column and the high intensity CO 2 laser were applied to initiate the ignition.
