30|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} extremeophile microalgae that are tolerant of low pH, we queried the AMIS database to identify any <b>lignite</b> <b>mines</b> (brown coal). <b>Lignite</b> is typically <b>mined</b> from soil which is rich in sulfur, which can give rise to low pH water bodies (Muzik 1982; Shang and Scott 2011). According to the AMIS database, the Onakawana mine (located at 81.433 longitude and 48.419 latitude) is the only abandoned <b>lignite</b> <b>mine</b> registered in Ontario. <b>Lignite</b> was <b>mined</b> there during the early 1980 ’s and no mine closure plan was filed or reported (Muzik 1982). Thus, we expected {{there to be a}} high probability of identifying low pH water bodies in proximity to the mine site where acid-tolerant high-lipid producing microalgae may be found.|$|R
