25|$|A nonprofessional {{performer}} named Richard Lacovara doubled for Basehart in long {{shots on}} the ledge, {{which had been}} enlarged to minimize risk of falling. Lacovara was protected by a canvas <b>life</b> <b>belt</b> hidden under his costume, connected to a lifeline, Even with the double, Basehart still had to endure over 300 hours of standing on the ledge with little movement during the 50 days of shooting in New York, {{even though he had}} a sprained ankle and his legs were ravaged by poison oak contracted on the grounds of his Coldwater Canyon home.|$|E
25|$|Both cutters {{were kept}} swung out, {{hanging from the}} davits, ready for {{immediate}} use, while collapsible lifeboatsC and D were stowed on the boat deck (connected to davits) immediately inboard of boats1 and 2 respectively. A and B were stored {{on the roof of}} the officers' quarters, on either side of number1 funnel. There were no davits to lower them and their weight would make them difficult to launch by hand. Each boat carried (among other things) food, water, blankets, and a spare <b>life</b> <b>belt.</b> Lifeline ropes on the boats' sides enabled them to save additional people from the water if necessary.|$|E
2500|$|A {{personal}} {{flotation device}} (abbreviated as PFD; {{also referred to}} as a life jacket, life preserver, <b>life</b> <b>belt,</b> Mae West, life vest, life saver, cork jacket, buoyancy aid or [...] flotation suit) is a piece of equipment designed to assist a wearer to keep afloat in water. The wearer may be either conscious or unconscious.|$|E

50|$|Anti-flash gear may be {{accompanied}} by other protective gear, such as <b>life</b> <b>belts,</b> helmets, gas masks, etc. While it may be worn by first-response fire-fighting parties, regular shipboard fire-fighters will usually wear full protective gear similar to civilian fire fighters.|$|R
5|$|At most {{swimming}} locations around Lake Burley Griffin {{there are}} fenced-in swimming areas for safety. In {{the more popular}} areas, there are also safety lockers with <b>life</b> <b>belts</b> and emergency phones for requesting help. Between 1962 and 1991, seven people died from drowning.|$|R
2500|$|The episode's plot {{contains}} {{a theme of}} equality and civil rights. [...] "The Mutants Are Revolting" [...] has been interpreted as a political warning against societies with a [...] "disposable class" [...] of people. [...] It has also been interpreted as a statement {{about the plight of}} undocumented immigrants, due in part to Leela's secret status as an [...] "illegal alien" [...] in the series (as mutants are not allowed to live on the surface). [...] Mr. Astor giving up his seat on the [...] "lifeboat" [...] for Leela's grandmother and great-grandmother may be a reference to Alfred Vanderbilt, a wealthy passenger on the Lusitania, who gave his <b>life</b> <b>belt</b> to a young woman and her child, though he himself could not swim.|$|E
60|$|Pleasant, was it not? It was not. I {{began to}} {{understand}} what a shipwrecked sailor must feel when he finds there's something gone wrong with the <b>life</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh get her out! Oh Di, DARLING! Oh get her out! Oh Daddy, Oh Daddy!' moaned the child's voice, in distraction. Somebody {{was in the}} water, with a <b>life</b> <b>belt.</b> Two boats paddled near, their {{lanterns}} swinging ineffectually, {{the boats}} nosing round.|$|E
50|$|For World War II, {{the company}} was again called upon to supply vast {{quantities}} of wellington and thigh boots. 80% of production was for war materials - from ground sheets to <b>life</b> <b>belts</b> and gas masks. In the Netherlands, forces were working in flooded conditions which demanded Wellingtons and tight boots in vast supplies.|$|R
5000|$|On December 17, at 13:00 Düsseldorf Express {{salvaged}} München's emergency buoy. By now wind speeds {{dropped to}} Force 3. The freighter Starlight found two <b>life</b> <b>belts,</b> at [...] the Sealand Consumer {{picked up a}} fourth empty life raft. Also three life vests were sighted, two of them by Starlight and another one by Evelyn.|$|R
6000|$|... "I daresay," [...] {{the officer}} who was {{standing}} by him answered. [...] "You were pretty near frozen to death. Luckily your <b>life</b> <b>belts</b> kept you from taking in any water, {{but it was a}} near squeak. Another three minutes in the water, and the doctor says it would have been all up with you." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was just}} one moment, the moment in which, on {{going down to the}} junior day room of his house to quell an unseemly disturbance, he was boisterously greeted by a {{vermilion}} bull terrier, when Mr. Downing was seized with a hideous fear lest he had lost his senses. Glaring down at the crimson animal that was pawing at his knees, he clutched at his reason for one second as a drowning man clutches at a <b>life</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
60|$|Ralph, however, put {{one hand}} upon Percy's <b>life</b> <b>belt,</b> and struck out for shore; but he {{felt that it was}} hopeless. Frightful pains were {{shooting}} through his limbs, and he breathed what he believed to be a last prayer; when a boom like thunder, a few yards off, galvanized him into life again--for he saw the gunboat, which they had seen in the morning, only a few yards distant. She had just fired a gun, loaded with grape, {{in the direction of the}} Germans who were firing. She was still at anchor, and the stream was drifting them down fast upon her.|$|E
6000|$|The {{real truth}} is that prices and wages and all the various {{payments}} {{from hand to hand}} in industrial society, are the outcome of a complex of competing forces that are not based upon justice but upon [...] "economic strength." [...] To elucidate this it is necessary to plunge into the jungle of pure economic theory. The way is arduous. There are no flowers upon the path. And out of this thicket, alas, no two people ever emerge hand in hand in concord. Yet it is a path that must be traversed. Let us take, then, as a beginning the very simplest case of the making of a price. It is the one which is sometimes called in books on economics the case of an unique monopoly. Suppose that I offer for sale the manuscript of the Pickwick Papers, or Shakespere's skull, or, for the matter of that, the skull of John Smith, what is the sum that I shall receive for it? It is the utmost that any one is willing to give for it. That is all one can say about it. There is no question here of cost or what I paid for the article or of anything else except the amount of the willingness to pay {{on the part of the}} highest bidder. It would be possible, indeed, for a bidder to take the article from me by force. But this we presume to be prevented by the law, and for this reason we referred above not to the physical strength, but to the [...] "economic strength" [...] of the parties to a bargain. By this is meant the relation that arises out of the condition of the supply and the demand, the willingness or eagerness, or the sheer necessity, of the buyers and the sellers. People may offer much because the thing to be acquired is an absolute necessity without which they perish; a drowning man would sell all that he had for a <b>life</b> <b>belt.</b> Or they may offer much through the sheer abundance of their other possessions. A millionaire might offer more for a <b>life</b> <b>belt</b> as a souvenir than a drowning man could pay for it to save his life.|$|E
50|$|In World War II, Hunter Boot {{was again}} {{requested}} to supply {{vast quantities of}} Wellington and thigh boots. 80% of production was of war materials - from (rubber) ground sheets to <b>life</b> <b>belts</b> and gas masks. In the Netherlands, the British forces were working in flooded conditions which demanded Wellingtons and thigh boots in vast supplies.|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of timing belts {{is the need}} for regular replacement of the <b>belt.</b> Recommended <b>belt</b> <b>life</b> varies between designs; belts made from neoprene for older vehicles might have a recommended life of around 20000 mi while newer designs with lower torque loading and made from hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR) may have a recommended life of 60000 mi or more. By 2004, the range for timing <b>belt</b> <b>life</b> for new engine designs was 60000 - 100000 mi, with some designs having no fixed replacement schedule but with continued use based on visual inspection. Torque loading, vibration, oil, heat and dirt reduce <b>belt</b> <b>life.</b> Timing <b>belts</b> are regularly replaced during engine overhauls.|$|R
50|$|In 39 voyages between Adelaide and Melbourne {{there had}} never been cause for alarm aboard Admella. Never any need for life boats or <b>life</b> <b>belts.</b> The vessel's only captain, Hugh McEwan was a {{cautious}} and capable master mariner. Admella had been built with watertight bulkheads, riveted to the hull. These were designed as a special safety feature, but were ultimately the cause of a catastrophic break up of the ship into three exposed sections in the first 15 minutes of the disaster.|$|R
50|$|After {{the horse}} <b>Life</b> <b>Belt</b> is disqualified {{for a drug}} violation, trainer Dan Morgan is {{suspended}} from horse racing. He goes {{to work in a}} lesser role for June and Jimmy Curtis at their stables and tends to Color Sergeant, an injured horse.|$|E
50|$|A {{personal}} {{flotation device}} (abbreviated as PFD; {{also referred to}} as a life jacket, life preserver, <b>life</b> <b>belt,</b> Mae West, life vest, life saver, cork jacket, buoyancy aid or flotation suit) is a piece of equipment designed to assist a wearer to keep afloat in water.

50|$|However, {{the main}} focus of the {{galleries}} is on arts, craft and wares, including exhibits on: Irish coins and currency, silverware, furniture, folklife and costumes, ceramics, glassware, etc. Included are artefacts such as Etruscan vases, gauntlets worn by King William at Battle of the Boyne, a <b>life</b> <b>belt</b> and oar salvaged from the wreck of the RMS Lusitania and a pocket book carried by Wolfe Tone whilst imprisoned in the Barracks. (See above).|$|E
5000|$|A {{personal}} {{force field}} technology {{known as the}} <b>life</b> support <b>belt</b> was seen only in Star Trek: The Animated Series. In addition to supplying the wearer with the appropriate atmosphere and environmental protection, it permitted the animators to simply draw the belt and yellow glow around the existing characters, {{instead of having to}} redraw them with an environmental suit. A version of the <b>life</b> support <b>belt</b> later appeared in an early Star Trek: The Next Generation novel, The Peacekeepers, where they were referred to as [...] "field-effect suits".|$|R
50|$|While Wheeling {{had been}} engaged in hunting U-39 and in {{collecting}} the scattered convoy, UB-50 joined the fracas. At about 2016, the American warship witnessed a flash, then heard a report, to her port side, as UB-50s torpedo slammed into SS Mavisbrook. The gunboat stopped her engines and began rescue operations. Over the side went two Franklin life buoys, two balsam rafts, and a dozen <b>life</b> <b>belts.</b> Just as she prepared to lower one of her boats to continue rescue duty, Surveyor appeared on the scene, assumed rescue duty, and released Wheeling to resume protection and collection of the convoy.|$|R
50|$|The Corporation of Glasgow who had {{organised}} {{the tournament}} {{and provided the}} cup named after Glasgow's patron saint as their donation to the Festival of Britain were left red faced when the triumphant players and manager Jimmy McGrory discovered, on closer examination, that the cup was decorated with ornate <b>life</b> <b>belts</b> and mermaids. It was revealed that the trophy was not in fact new but third hand. The cup {{had been made in}} 1894 as a yachting trophy. In 1912 it had been altered for a football competition between Provan Gasworks and a City of Glasgow Police team.|$|R
50|$|He started 1928 with {{wins over}} George Rose, Auguste Gyde, and another defeat of Hyams in a title eliminator, before facing Ernie Rice in September for the British {{lightweight}} title vacated by Harry Mason, with Steward's Sporting <b>Life</b> <b>belt</b> also at stake. Steward knocked Rice {{out in the}} twelfth round to become British champion. He rounded off the year with a draw against former French champion Lucien Vinez and a win over future Dutch champion Jan Scheffers.|$|E

5000|$|Zamyatin later recalled, [...] "In England, I built ships, {{looked at}} ruined castles, {{listened to the}} thud of bombs dropped by German zeppelins, and wrote The Islanders. I regret that I {{did not see the}} February Revolution, and know only the October Revolution (I {{returned}} to Petersburg, past German submarines, in a ship with lights out, wearing a <b>life</b> <b>belt</b> the whole time, just in time for October). This is the same as never having been in love and waking up one morning already married for ten years or so.." ...|$|E
60|$|Both boys now {{took off}} their coats and waistcoats, {{put on a}} warm flannel jersey over their flannel shirts, and then wound the {{bandages}} of India rubber round each other's bodies. They began under the arms; drawing the webbing tight, as they wound it round, so that its natural elasticity caused each turn to press tightly upon the turn above, which it overlapped. This bandage was continued down to {{the lower part of}} the body. Then they put on the <b>life</b> <b>belts.</b> Over them they put their suits of white calico, white shoes with India rubber soles, the white caps, and swimming gloves.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{hearing that}} Hood had sunk, Electra {{raced to the}} area, {{arriving}} about 2 hours after Hood went down. They were expecting to find many survivors, and rigged scrambling nets and heaving lines, and placed <b>life</b> <b>belts</b> on the deck {{where they could be}} quickly thrown in. From the 94 officers and 1,321 ratings aboard Hood, just three survivors were found. Electra rescued them, and continued searching. Shortly thereafter, Icarus and Anthony joined in the search, and the three ships searched the area for more survivors. No more were found, only driftwood, debris, and a desk drawer filled with documents. After several hours searching, they left the area.|$|R
40|$|Charles S. Price" {{is another}} of the mystery vessels that {{went down in the}} Big Storm of November 11, 1913. Eleven vessels were sent to the bottom and several others were badly wrecked. The total amount of lives lost was 244. What {{happened}} to some of these boats will never be known. This applies to the "Charles S. Price," an ore carrier for the Hanna fleet of Cleveland, Ohio, and the "Regina," a Canadian vessel. Both of these vessels shared their doom together. A few miles from Fort Gratiot Light near Port Huron, Michigan, {{at the entrance to the}} St. Clair River, on the Monday of the Big Storm, a ship was sighted floating upside down. There was no way to identify it for several days while the storm raged as it floated about. When the storm subsided, a diver discovered that the carrier was the "Charles S. Price. " Its entire crew of 28 men were sent to their doom. The bodies of Captain W. A. Black and half of the crew were found the next day. Some of the crew of the "Charles S. Price" were wearing the <b>life</b> <b>belts</b> of the "Regina. " This is another mystery. It is believed that the two ships may have collided in the massive storm and that the sailors jumped or were thrown from one ship to the other and donned whatever <b>life</b> <b>belts</b> were available. No one will ever know the truth due to there being no survivors and the "Charles S. Price" being at the bottom of Lake Huron...|$|R
50|$|A {{native of}} Huangpi, Hubei, {{he was the}} son of a Qing veteran of the Taiping Rebellion (黎朝相). He {{graduated}} from the Tianjin naval academy in 1889 and served as an engineer in the First Sino-Japanese war. His cruiser was sunk and he survived because of his <b>life</b> <b>belt,</b> since he could not swim. He later joined the Hubei New Army and became senior military officer in Hankou. In 1910, he attempted to break up revolutionary rings that infiltrated his 21st Mixed Brigade. He did not arrest anyone caught in subversive activities, but simply dismissed them.|$|E
50|$|By stage 2 (day 1-2), {{penetration}} {{is complete}} and the flea has burrowed {{most of its}} body into the skin. Only the anus, the copulatory organs, and four rear air holes in fleas called stigmatas remain {{on the outside of}} the epidermis. The anus will excrete feces that is thought to attract male fleas for mating, described in a later section. The hypertrophic zone between tergites 2 and 3 in the abdominal region begins to expand a day or two after penetration and takes the appearance of a <b>life</b> <b>belt.</b> During this time, the flea begins to feed on the host’s blood.|$|E
5000|$|On 21 October, Seid was escorting Stoney Point to Espiritu Santo. At {{approximately}} 2000 hours, {{a message}} was received from Stoney Point stating {{that she had}} just passed {{a man in the}} water. Upon returning to the point and illuminating the area with search lights, it was discovered that the man floating in the water was attached to Seid. Though surrounded by sharks and supported only by a <b>life</b> <b>belt,</b> the man was recovered uninjured. Upon questioning, it was learned that he had fallen asleep on the fantail and fell off the ship as she rolled.|$|E
50|$|According {{to his own}} account, all {{was smooth}} and quiet while he was {{sleeping}} in a bunk until one of the watchmen came down {{and said that they}} all had to put their <b>life</b> <b>belts</b> on and go up to the deck. Daniels then went up to deck and awaited orders along with other crew members. They received orders to get all the women and children up to the deck and into their lifeboats. When he finished his task, there was only one remaining lifeboat, which was a collapsible boat secured {{to the top of the}} wireless room and lashed down with varying lashings. Someone asked for a pocket knife and Daniels obliged.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} synchronous <b>belt</b> <b>life</b> {{through the}} determination of the life-limiting parameters within a belt drive. Six different belt constructions were life-tested, producing three failure modes: tooth root cracking, cord delamination and fabric separation. The life test results were then correlated to various tooth dejections within the belt run. The results of this examination were then used to draw conclusions about which material properties most influence the <b>belt</b> <b>life.</b> I t is concluded that the tooth deflections at entry to and exit from the pulleys are most damaging, and that any material change which will increase the dynamic tooth stiffness will increase the <b>belt</b> <b>life</b> within the three failure modes encountered. ...|$|R
50|$|The chief {{engineer}} advised the Captain that the Taiaroa was making water. <b>Life</b> <b>belts</b> were handed {{out to all}} the passengers and crew. An unsuccessful {{attempt was made to}} get a line ashore. The Captain ordered all to the four life boats, the intent being to wait until light and then make for the beach. The boats were attached by lines astern but three soon capsized in the heavy sea. A rocket was sent up and a blue light burned to show the position of the beach. Most of those thrown from the capsizing lift boats were drowned having been overcome by the cold. Had they all remained on board they would most likely have all survived.|$|R
