40|$|In face of gradual {{ecological}} deterioration, the Chinese {{government has}} been in search of more efficient and effective mitigation policies, aiming to promote the sustainability of livestock production. However, researchers and policy makers seem to neglect a key issue: pinpoint policies are the most important, which means niche targeting is the premise before any policy design, such that better knowing of the livestock farmers preference is prerequisite. This paper then analyzes this question using a method of choice experiment to elicit the farmers’ preference and valuation of <b>livestock</b> <b>pollution</b> control policy instruments at household-scale, medium-scale and large-scale farms. Five attributes (technology regulation, pollution charge, biogas subsidy, manure price, and information provisioning) were set as <b>livestock</b> <b>pollution</b> control policy instruments. In total, 754 pigs farmers from five representative provinces in China were surveyed, and the collected {{data were analyzed using}} random parameter logit models. The marginal substitution rates for attributes are estimated both with preference space approach and willingness to pay space approach. The results show significant heterogeneities in farmers’ preferences and valuations for <b>livestock</b> <b>pollution</b> control policy instruments within the three scales. All policy instruments effectively increased the manure eco-friendly treatment ratio for medium-scale farms, and household-scale farms showed little change in the manure eco-friendly treatment ratio under all policy instruments. Household-scale farms and medium-scale farms suggested the highest preference for the biogas subsidy policy, while large-scale farms suggested the highest preference for the manure price policy...|$|E

It is very necessary to study and develop efficient, low-cost, resource utilization of livestock sewage treatment technology according to local conditions...|$|E
40|$|The Environmental Protection Agency is {{considering}} regulation of large-scale hog producers {{under the federal}} Clean Air Act, but little is understood about livestock’s effects on ambient air quality at the national level. I use the geographic changes in swine industry concentration between 1980 and 2002 to identify ambient air pollution attributable to this industry, controlling for numerous other factors. Doubling the number of hogs per square mile yields a 6. 6 % increase in sulfur-based ambient air pollution. Externality costs {{are estimated to be}} greater than possible regulatory requirements, suggesting societal gains from regulation. Key words: externalities, hogs, <b>livestock,</b> <b>pollution,</b> regulation. JEL Classification: Q 5. Shifts in hog production’s scale and technol-ogy {{over the past several decades}} have led to spatial concentration and thousands of ani-mals per operation. These changes coincide with a heightened interest in hog produc-tion’s contribution to air pollution, namely hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and ammonia (NH 3). These air pollutants are the source of heated debates in farming communities across the United States, as neighbors of large-scale live-stock operations have raised concerns over environmental and public health effects. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently considering uniform regulations of large-scale livestock production under the federal Clean Air Act (CAA) but has sug-gested in recent regulatory decisions that emis-sions from these sources do not warrant con-cern (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2009). Current knowledge on air pollu-tion from livestock facilities arises mostly from small, region- or farm-specific studies, which the National Research Council criticizes as not representative enough for federal policy mak-ing (2003). Also lacking are estimates of effects on ambient levels pertinent to public healt...|$|E

40|$|Amphibians are a disproportionately {{threatened}} {{group of}} vertebrates, {{the status of}} which in Sub-Saharan Africa is still uncertain, with heterogeneous fauna punctuated by mountains. Mount Oku, Cameroon is one such mountain, which holds many endemic and restricted-range species. The history of amphibian research on Mt Oku, current knowledge on biogeography and conservation biology is reviewed, including recent findings. This updated inventory adds 25 further species, with 50 species of amphibian so far recorded to the Oku Massif (c. 900 to 3, 011 m). This includes 5 endemic to Mt Oku, 7 endemic to the Bamenda Highlands, 18 restricted to the highlands of Cameroon and Nigeria, and 20 with broader ranges across Africa. This includes a new mountain locality for the Critically Endangered Leptodactylodon axillaris. Among others, the first record of Phrynobatrachus schioetzi and Ptychadena taenioscelis from Cameroon are presented. The uncertainty of habitat affinities and elevational ranges are discussed. The proportion of threatened species on Mt Oku is 44. 2 %, but projected to increase to 47. 9 % due to new species descriptions and recent dramatic declines. The natural habitats of Mt Oku are irreplaceable refuges for its endemic and restricted-range amphibian populations under severe pressure elsewhere in their range. Threats to this important amphibian fauna are increasing, including agricultural encroachment, expanding aquaculture, <b>livestock</b> grazing, <b>pollution,</b> invasive species, forest loss and degradation.

40|$|Thousands of {{confined}} {{animal feeding}} operations (CAFOs) {{have been constructed}} in eastern North Carolina. The fecal waste pit and spray field waste management systems used by these operations are susceptible to flooding in this low-lying region. To investigate the potential that flood events can lead to environmental dispersion of animal wastes containing numerous biologic and chemical hazards, we compared the geographic coordinates of 2, 287 CAFOs permitted by the North Carolina Division of Water Quality (DWQ) with estimates of flooding derived from digital satellite images of eastern North Carolina taken approximately 1 week after Hurricane Floyd dropped as much as 15 – 20 inches of rain in September 1999. Three cattle, one poultry, and 237 swine operations had geographic coordinates within the satellite-based flooded area. DWQ confirmed 46 operations with breached or flooded fecal waste pits in the same area. Only 20 of these 46 CAFOs were within the satellite-based estimate of the inundated area. CAFOs within the satellite-based flood area were located in 132 census block groups {{with a population of}} 171, 498 persons in the 2000 census. African Americans were more likely than whites to live in areas with flooded CAFOs according to satellite estimates, but not according to DWQ reports. These areas have high poverty rates and dependence on wells for drinking water. Our analysis suggests that flood events have a significant potential to degrade environmental health because of dispersion of wastes from industrial animal operations in areas with vulnerable populations.

40|$|Rationale: Livestock farm {{emissions}} may {{not only}} affect respiratory health of farmers {{but also of}} neighboring residents. Objectives: To explore associations between both spatial and temporal variation in pollutant emissions from livestock farms and lung function in a general, non-farming, rural population in the Netherlands. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2, 308 adults (age 20 - 72 years). A pulmonary function test was performed measuring pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV 1, FVC, FEV 1 /FVC and MMEF. Spatial exposure was assessed as 1) number of farms within 500 m and 1, 000 m of the home, 2) distance to the nearest farm, and 3) modelled annual average fine dust emissions from farms within 500 m and 1, 000 m of the home address. Temporal exposure was assessed as week-average ambient PM 10 and ammonia (NH 3) concentrations prior to lung function measurements. Data were analyzed with generalized additive models (smoothing). Results: A negative association {{was found between the}} number of livestock farms within a 1, 000 m buffer from the home address and MMEF, which was more pronounced in non-atopic participants. No associations were found with other spatial exposure variables. Week-average PM 10 and NH 3 levels were negatively associated with FEV 1, FEV 1 /FVC and MMEF. In a two-pollutant model, only NH 3 remained associated. A 25 µg/m 3 increase in NH 3 was associated with a 2. 22 % lower FEV 1 (95 %CI - 3. 69 to - 0. 74), FEV 1 /FVC: - 1. 12 % (- 1. 96 to - 0. 28) and MMEF: - 5. 67 % (- 8. 80 to - 2. 55).

40|$|The {{focus on}} {{protecting}} our surface water {{has shifted to}} controlling nonpoint <b>pollution.</b> <b>Livestock</b> grazing riparian areas {{have been identified as}} a source of nonpoint pollution. Riparian areas are the green vegetated areas adjacent to a creek, stream, or river. The impacts of livestock grazing riparian areas include manure and urine deposited directly into or near surface waters where leaching and runoff can transport nutrients and pathogens into the water. Unmanaged grazing may accelerate erosion and sedimentation into surface water, change stream flow, and destroy aquatic habitats. Im-proper grazing can reduce the capacity of riparian areas to filter contaminates, shade aquatic habitats, and stabilize streambanks. Faced with the negative impacts, many recommend the total, permanent exclusion of livestock from riparian areas. Although this is one option, because of its cost-prohibitive nature, its adoption has not been widespread. The negative impacts of livestock grazing riparian areas can be prevented, minimized, or improved by controlling when, where, how long, and with what intensity livestock graze the forages in the riparian area. So far in this series of fact sheets we have looked at the issues around livestock grazing riparian areas. This Photo courtesy of USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service.

40|$|The Penrith Sandstone aquifer is a {{regionally}} {{important source}} of public water supply and is locally impacted by anthropogenic <b>pollution.</b> <b>Livestock</b> rearing is the main agricultural activity in the Eden valley, Northwest England. The spreading of slurry wastes on grassland to improve pasture is common place and has increased in recent years. Both the timing and quantities applied are more dictated {{by the need to}} dispose of the slurry than to meet the crops nutrient needs. This leads to nutrient loss to runoff, posing a threat to surface water quality, and loss to the unsaturated zone due to recharge which can lead to increased groundwater nutrient concentrations. This study shows the novel use of excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy to rapidly trace the source and quality of dissolved organic matter within the unsaturated zone. Changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), fulvic-like (FA) and tryptophan-like (TRP) intensities and TRP: FA ratios (1. 6 - 0. 4) within the unsaturated zone are strongly suggestive a farm waste source of organic carbon. The preferential removal of the more labile TRP within the shallow unsaturated zone compared to the FA is likely due to microbial degradation. Fluorescence analysis allowed the rapid assessment of different types and relative abundances of dissolved organic matter (DOM), and fingerprinting of different sources of organic carbon within the unsaturated zone...|$|R

These have triggered criticisms from the community. Treating or processing the waste, not only will reduce the impact on the environment, but also will provide benefits because {{it can be used to}} produce fuel.

40|$|International audienceNitrogen (N) limits {{crop and}} grass production, {{and it is}} an {{essential}} component of dietary proteins. However, N is mobile in the soil-plant system and can be lost to the environment. Estimates of N flows provide a critical tool for understanding and improving the sustainability and equity of the global food system. This letter describes an integrated analysis of changes in N in human diets, N use efficiency (NUE) of cropping and <b>livestock</b> systems, N <b>pollution</b> and N in traded food and feed products for 12 world regions for the period 1960 – 2050. The largest absolute change in consumption of animal proteins during the period 1960 – 2009 is seen in China, while the largest share of animal protein per capita is currently observed in North America, Europe and Oceania. Due to the substantial growth of the livestock sector, about three quarters of contemporary global crop production (expressed in protein and including fodder crops and bioenergy byproducts) is allocated to livestock. Trends and levels of NUE and N surpluses in crop production are also diverse, as some regions show soil N depletion (developing regions, e. g. Africa), improving efficiency (industrialized regions, e. g. USA and Europe) and excessive N use (e. g. China, India). Global trade between the 12 regions has increased by a factor of 7. 5 for vegetable proteins and by a factor of 10 for animal proteins. The scenarios for 2050 demonstrate that {{it would be possible to}} feed the global population in 2050 with moderate animal protein consumption but with much less N pollution, and less international trade than today. In such a scenario, optimal allocation of N inputs among regions to maximize NUE would further decrease pollution, but would require increased levels of N trade comparable to those in a BAU scenario...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} of livestock breeding in China has increased rapidly since 1949, {{and the total}} output of meat, poultry and eggs maintains the world's top first in recent 20 years. <b>Livestock</b> emissions and <b>pollution</b> is closely associated with its population and spatial distribution. This paper aims to investigate the spatial patterns of livestock and poultry breeding in China. Using statistical yearbook and agricultural survey in 2007, the county-level populations of livestock and poultry are estimated as equivalent standardized pig index (ESP), per cultivated land pig index (PCLP) and per capita pig index (PCP). With the help of spatial data analysis (ESDA) tools in Geoda and ArcGIS software, especially the Moran's I and LISA statistics, the nationwide global and local clustering trends of the three indicators are examined respectively. The Moran's I and LISA analysis shows that ESP and PCP are significantly clustering both globally and locally. However, PCLP is clustering locally but not significant globally. Furthermore, the thematic map series (TMS) and related gravity centers curve (GCC) are introduced to explore the spatial patterns of livestock and poultry in China. The indicators are classified into 16 levels, and the GCCs for the three indicators from level 1 to 16 are discussed in detail. For districting purpose, each interval between gravity centers of near levels for all the three indicators is calculated, and the districting types of each indicator are obtained by merging adjacent levels. The districting analysis for the three indicators shows that there exists a potential uniform districting scheme for China's livestock and poultry breeding. As a result, the China's livestock and poultry breeding would be classified into eight types: extremely sparse region, sparse region, relatively sparse region, normally sparse region, normal region, relatively concentrated region, concentrated region and highly concentrated region. It is also found that there exists a clear demarcation line between the concentrated and the sparse regions.
