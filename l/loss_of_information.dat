5|$|Protein {{structures}} have to {{be represented}} in some coordinate-independent space to make them comparable. This is typically achieved by constructing a sequence-to-sequence matrix or series of matrices that encompass comparative metrics: rather than absolute distances relative to a fixed coordinate space. An intuitive representation is the distance matrix, which is a two-dimensional matrix containing all pairwise distances between some subset of the atoms in each structure (such as the alpha carbons). The matrix increases in dimensionality {{as the number of}} structures to be simultaneously aligned increases. Reducing the protein to a coarse metric such as secondary structure elements (SSEs) or structural fragments can also produce sensible alignments, despite the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> from discarding distances, as noise is also discarded. Choosing a representation to facilitate computation is critical to developing an efficient alignment mechanism.|$|E

In turn, the information from each individual principal component (PC) can be presented graphically in synthetic maps. These maps show peaks and troughs, which represent populations whose gene frequencies take extreme values compared {{to others in the}} studied area.|$|E

25|$|One {{approach}} to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is to incorporate stochastic (random) behaviour into the system. Stochastic behaviour destroys {{information contained in}} the ensemble. While this is technically inaccurate (aside from hypothetical situations involving black holes, a system cannot in itself cause <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>information),</b> the randomness is added to reflect that information of interest becomes converted over time into subtle correlations within the system, or to correlations between the system and environment. These correlations appear as chaotic or pseudorandom influences on the variables of interest. By replacing these correlations with randomness proper, the calculations can be made much easier.|$|E
25|$|The UAB Laboratory also {{functions}} as an environmentally-controlled curatorial repository for Navy's recovered artifacts {{that are not}} on loan to museums or other institutions. After removal from an underwater environment, the artifacts are in immediate danger due to the deteriorating affects of increased oxygen, temperature, light, and other atmospheric conditions. While artifacts are undergoing conservation in the laboratory, they are scientifically analyzed and thoroughly documented to prevent <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> throughout the stabilization process. Even after they are stabilized, artifacts excavated from underwater sites require periodic monitoring and evaluation, as they are susceptible to fluctuations in their immediate environment. All collections are available for study, with research as its goal.|$|E
25|$|According to some {{lines of}} thinking, the ageing process is routed into a basic {{reduction}} of biological complexity, and thus <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> In order {{to reverse this}} loss, gerontologist Marios Kyriazis suggested {{that it is necessary}} to increase input of actionable and meaningful information both individually (into individual brains), and collectively (into societal systems). This technique enhances overall biological function through up-regulation of immune, hormonal, antioxidant and other parameters, resulting in improved age-repair mechanisms. Working in parallel with natural evolutionary mechanisms that can facilitate survival through increased fitness, Kyriazis claims that the technique may lead to a reduction of the rate of death as a function of age, i.e. indefinite lifespan.|$|E

25|$|Summary {{statistics}} {{may be used}} {{to increase}} the acceptance rate of ABC for high-dimensional data. Low-dimensional sufficient statistics are optimal for this purpose, as they capture all relevant information present in the data in the simplest possible form. However, low-dimensional sufficient statistics are typically unattainable for statistical models where ABC-based inference is most relevant, and consequently, some heuristic is usually necessary to identify useful low-dimensional summary statistics. The use of a set of poorly chosen summary statistics will often lead to inflated credible intervals due to the implied <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> which can also bias the discrimination between models. A review of methods for choosing summary statistics is available, which may provide valuable guidance in practice.|$|E

RELAX NG schemas may be written in either an XML based syntax or a more compact non-XML syntax; the two syntaxes are isomorphic and James Clark's conversion tool——can convert between them without <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> RELAX NG has a simpler definition and validation framework than XML Schema, making it easier to use and implement. It also has the ability to use datatype framework plug-ins; a RELAX NG schema author, for example, can require values in an XML document to conform to definitions in XML Schema Datatypes.|$|E
25|$|JPEG's lossy {{compression}} also suffers from generation loss, where repeatedly decoding and re-encoding an image {{to save it}} again causes a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> each time, degrading the image. This does not happen with repeated viewing or copying, {{but only if the}} file is edited and saved over again. Because PNG is lossless, it is suitable for storing images to be edited. While PNG is reasonably efficient when compressing photographic images, there are lossless compression formats designed specifically for photographic images, lossless WebP and Adobe DNG (digital negative) for example. However these formats are either not widely supported, or are proprietary. An image can be stored losslessly and converted to JPEG format only for distribution, so that there is no generation loss.|$|E

500|$|During the {{creation}} of the State Archives in the nineteenth century, documents were organized according to their importance. Hatt-ı hümayuns on the white were considered the most important, along with those on international relations, border transactions and internal regulations. Documents of secondary importance were routinely placed in trunks and stored in cellars in need of repair. Presumably as a sign of respect toward the Sultan, hatt-ı hümayuns on documents (petitions, reports, etc.) were cut out and stored together with the hatt-ı hümayuns on the white, {{while the rest of the}} documents were stored elsewhere. These cut-out hatt-ı hümayuns were not cross-referenced with the documents to which they referred and were only annotated by the palace office using general terms and an approximate date. Because Sultans were not in the habit of dating their hatt-ı hümayuns until the late period of the empire, in most cases the documents associated with them are not known. Conversely, the decisions on many a memorandum, petition, or request submitted to the Sultan are unknown. The separation of hatt-ı hümayuns from their documents is considered a great <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> for researchers.

500|$|The Sackler Gallery, {{part of the}} Smithsonian Institution, was due to {{host the}} US premiere {{exhibition}} of the Belitung cargo in early 2012—a date set {{to coincide with the}} Smithsonian museum's 25th anniversary celebration. On 28 June 2011 it was reported that the museum was postponing the show. The Sackler Gallery has received condemnation of the exhibition due to the time-frame and nature of the original excavation of the artefacts; with arguments put forwards about whether the display should be allowed. According to The New York Times, [...] "a group of archaeologists and anthropologists from the National Academy of Sciences — including Robert McCormick Adams, a former leader of the Smithsonian" [...] wrote {{to the head of the}} Smithsonian Institution, G. Wayne Clough, on 5 April 2011 claiming that [...] "proceeding with the exhibition would 'severely damage the stature and reputation' of the institution." [...] Proponents of the arguments against display say that the excavation was for commercial gain and conducted so quickly as to have caused a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> pertaining to the crew and cargo. The New York Times article goes on to say that further comments were made by [...] "the Society for American Archaeology, the Council of American Maritime Museums and the International Committee for Underwater Cultural Heritage, as well as groups within the Smithsonian, including the members of the anthropology department and the Senate of Scientists at its National Museum of Natural History" [...] all asking that the Smithsonian reconsider the exhibition. There are also claims that exhibiting the artefacts would be against international agreements on underwater excavations. Kimberly L. Faulk, a marine archaeologist and vice chairwoman of the non-governmental Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology said that, [...] "by proceeding with the exhibition the Smithsonian — which is a research institution as well as a network of museums — would be violating its own set of professional ethics and promoting the looting of archaeological sites." ...|$|E
