5|$|Ark Royal {{had entered}} refit to {{accommodate}} the Phantom in 1967; this involved a major reconstruction, including several elements to allow the ship to operate the aircraft – the flight deck was increased in area and fully angled to 8½°, the arresting gear was replaced with a new water-spray system {{to accommodate the}} Phantom's higher weight and <b>landing</b> <b>speed,</b> and bridle catchers and water-cooled JBDs were fitted to the catapults. Once this work was complete, Eagle was scheduled to undergo a similar modernization. In 1969, the planned refit of Eagle was cancelled, and the options for seven additional FG.1s was not taken up. As a consequence, {{it was decided to}} further reduce the FAA's Phantom fleet to just 28 aircraft. The remaining 20 aircraft were then allocated to the Royal Air Force.|$|E
5|$|British {{forces were}} ordered {{withdrawn}} {{a few days}} later. The evacuation (Operation Alphabet) began in the north {{on the night of}} 3/4 June, and Glorious arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She only carried nine Sea Gladiators of 802 Squadron and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 823 Squadron for self-defence, as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher <b>landing</b> <b>speed</b> than the biplanes. This {{was the first time that}} high performance monoplanes without tailhooks had been landed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E
5|$|The Zveno-3 {{in which}} TB-3 carried two Grigorovich I-Z fighters under the wings {{presented}} a different challenge — the I-Z was a monoplane with fixed landing gear which touched the ground {{while it was}} suspended under the mothership. To accommodate the uneven ground during takeoffs, the fighters were attached via a floating frame that permitted vertical movement relative to the TB-3. However, immediately after takeoff the I-Z pilots had to push forward on the control sticks to lock the frame in the fixed bottom position — if the fighter-bomber was not rigid in flight, the bomber became extremely difficult to control. During one of the test flights, I-Z pilot Korotkov incorrectly timed the locking maneuver and the lift generated by his fighter broke the docking frame and crashed him {{into the bottom of}} the mothership's wing. As the bomber came in for an emergency landing with both fighters still attached, the slow <b>landing</b> <b>speed</b> of the TB-3 resulted in loss of lift for the I-Z which fell away, killing Korotkov. This was the most serious accident of the entire Zveno program despite the inherent complexity of carrying as many as five aircraft, performing mid-air launches and dockings, and damage to the motherships by propellers and landing gear of the fighters. Tests with various combinations of aircraft determined that top-mounted configurations presented the most difficulty in docking due to turbulent airflow coming off the mothership's wings. The problem of safe underwing attachment was solved with the appearance of the Polikarpov I-16 fighter with retractable landing gear. This permitted the use of the same rigid mounting frames as for the top-mounted aircraft.|$|E

50|$|On 18 May 1922, Guinness {{used the}} car to set new <b>Land</b> <b>Speed</b> Records at Brooklands: the Brooklands lap record at 121.54 mph, then the flying-start <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> records over a half-mile, kilometre, mile and two miles. The fastest record being 136.05 mph for the half-mile. These were the last <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> records to be set on a {{racetrack}} rather than a beach or salt flat.|$|R

25|$|The first Ki-44 {{prototype}} flew in August 1940 and {{the initial}} test flights were generally encouraging, with handling considered acceptable considering the high wing loading. Problems encountered included a high <b>landing</b> <b>speed</b> and poor forward visibility during taxiing due to the large radial engine.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> record [...] "Green Monster" [...] won the <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> record {{three times}} during the close {{competition}} of 1964 and 1965. It was powered by an F-104 Starfighter jet engine with four-stage afterburner.|$|R
50|$|Ernest Arthur Douglas Eldridge (18 July 1897 - 27 October 1937) was a British {{racing car}} driver {{who broke the}} world <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> record in 1924. His was the last <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> record set on an open road.|$|R
50|$|He is {{best known}} today for <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> records set in his car Thunderbolt. Between 1937 and 1939 he set three new <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> records, wresting them from Malcolm Campbell's Blue Bird, but was twice bettered by John Cobb.|$|R
25|$|The Wright Model D {{was built}} to sell to the United States Army for an {{observation}} aircraft. It was similar in design to the Wright Model R with a 6-60 motor. The Model D could fly 66.9mph and climb 525 feet per minute, but its excessive <b>landing</b> <b>speed</b> discouraged the Army from ordering more.|$|E
25|$|Changing wind {{conditions}} are another risk factor. In conditions of strong winds, and turbulence during hot days the parachutist can {{be caught in}} downdrafts close to the ground. Shifting winds can cause a crosswind or downwind landing which have a higher potential for injury due to the wind speed adding to the <b>landing</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although it {{was praised}} by its pilots, {{including}} John Salmond, later to become Chief of the Air Staff, its <b>landing</b> <b>speed</b> of 52mph (84km/h) was considered {{too fast for}} operational use, and the engine was still too unreliable, being replaced by a 100hp (75kW) Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine. With this engine, speed fell to a less impressive 92mph (148km/h).|$|E
50|$|Golden Arrow was a <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> record racer {{built in}} Britain {{to regain the}} world <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> record from USA. Henry Segrave drove the car at Daytona Beach and {{exceeded}} the previous record by 24 mph or 39 km/h.|$|R
50|$|John Godfrey Parry-Thomas (6 April 1884 - 3 March 1927) was a Welsh {{engineer}} and motor-racing driver who {{at one time}} held the <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> record. He was the first driver to be killed {{in pursuit of the}} <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> record.|$|R
50|$|After Campbell's {{achievement}} of the 300 mph <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> record with Blue Bird in 1935 {{he retired from the}} <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> record. Shortly afterwards he switched his attentions to the water speed record, at that time dominated by the American Gar Wood.|$|R
25|$|On 1 May 1983, an Israeli Air Force F-15D {{collided}} mid-air with an A-4 Skyhawk {{during a}} training flight, causing the F-15's right wing {{to shear off}} almost completely. Despite the damage, the pilot was able to reach a nearby airbase and land safely – albeit at twice the normal <b>landing</b> <b>speed.</b> The aircraft was subsequently repaired and saw further combat action.|$|E
25|$|When Caproni had {{completed}} initial testing, the Regia Aeronautica {{took control of}} the plane and transferred it to Guidonia Montecelio for a brief series of further test flights. All test pilots reported that the plane was extremely stable in flight, {{to the point where it}} was difficult to change course; test pilots were also astounded by the very low <b>landing</b> <b>speed</b> and the consequently very short landing run.|$|E
25|$|An {{aspect of}} the type often criticised was the high <b>landing</b> <b>speed</b> imposed by the wing design. Because of the low {{production}} level, {{based on the number}} of Peregrines available, no redesign of the wing was contemplated, although Westland did test the effectiveness of leading-edge slats to reduce speeds. When the slats were activated with such force that they were ripped off the wings, the slats were wired shut.|$|E
50|$|The {{first person}} to use Pendine Sands for a world <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> record attempt was Malcolm Campbell. On September 25, 1924 he set a world <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> record of 146.16 mph (235.22 km/h) on Pendine Sands in his Sunbeam 350HP car Blue Bird.|$|R

25|$|On 21 July 2015 at Pendine {{beach in}} Wales the 90th anniversary of Sir Malcolm Campbell’s first world <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> record in ‘Bluebird’ was recreated by his grandson, Don Wales, also a <b>Land</b> <b>Speed</b> Record holder, who recreated {{the event in}} the fully {{restored}} car.|$|R
25|$|It was a {{conventional}} two-bay biplane design {{based on the}} M.F.6 and M.F.7, with open cockpits in tandem for the student and instructor. The main difference between the M.F.8 and the M.F.7 were that M.F.8 had a new tail rudder and wing profile, {{in order to increase}} <b>landing</b> <b>speed.</b> The new profile had been developed by the Swedish professor Nordensvan, in cooperation with the Norwegian Army Air Service.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} of the Witch, serial J8596, was first flown on 30 January 1928 at RAF Andover, with Louis Paget at the controls. The type was praised for its stability as a bombing platform, and its 138mph maximum speed was good, although its 62mph <b>landing</b> <b>speed</b> was felt to be too fast. However, the Witch was judged unsuitable for service due to structural weaknesses, including a number of failures of the landing gear struts and other components.|$|E
25|$|The pilots {{flew the}} aircraft, which can carry up to 46,860 pounds (21,255kg) of {{aviation}} fuel, in a figure eight pattern between Bob Hope Airport in Burbank and LAX {{for more than}} two hours in order to burn fuel and lower the risk of fire upon landing. This also served to lighten the plane, reducing potential stress on the landing gear and dramatically lowering <b>landing</b> <b>speed</b> as well. The Airbus A320 does not have the mechanical facility to dump fuel, despite various news agencies reporting that the aircraft was doing so over the ocean.|$|E
50|$|The {{design team}} are all British. The machine was {{primarily}} designed and created by Alex Macfadzean, {{who holds the}} British motorcycle <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> record. Macfadzean had worked as crew member on Don Vesco's wheel-driven <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> record holding (as of 2014) automobile Turbinator in 2001.|$|R
50|$|The world <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> record remains unbroken.|$|R
50|$|The British <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> {{record is}} the fastest <b>land</b> <b>speed</b> {{achieved}} by a vehicle in the United Kingdom, as opposed to one on water or in the air. It is standardised as the speed over a course of fixed length, averaged over two runs in opposite directions.|$|R
25|$|One radical {{requirement}} of the proposed aircraft was the ability {{for it to be}} operated from straight stretches of rural highways only 500 meters long; this was considered critical to reducing the vulnerability to attack {{in the event of a}} pre-emptive strike upon the nation through the dispersal of aircraft from established airbases to more austere improvised landing strips. In order to enable such operations, this imposed several critical demands upon the design, including a modest <b>landing</b> <b>speed,</b> no-flare touchdown, powerful post-landing deceleration, accurate steering even in crosswinds on icy surfaces, and high acceleration on take-off.|$|E
25|$|In 1924 the British Air Ministry issued {{specification}} 4/24 for a twin-engined home defence fighter, {{which would}} be employed to defend Britain against night attacks by enemy heavy bombers. The aircraft {{had to have a}} top speed of at least 125mph (201km/h) and a <b>landing</b> <b>speed</b> of not more than 50mph (80km/h). In September 1925 the Air Staff amended the specification to specify the use of the 37-mm COW gun and supercharged engines. From the design proposals submitted by the manufacturers, two types were selected for prototypes development, the Bristol Bagshot and the Westland Westbury. Two airframes were ordered from Westland, allotted serial numbers J7765 and J7766.|$|E
25|$|In July 1948, Major Townsend {{started as}} the lead {{military}} pilot for the Air Force evaluation of the Boeing B-47 jet bomber. A result of B-47's sleek design, the aircraft required a high <b>landing</b> <b>speed</b> and an excessively long distance to stop. Townsend suggested {{the addition of a}} parachute, deployed shortly before touch-down, to shorten the landing distance. Equally dangerous, landing at a reduced engine power setting left the pilot unable to quickly command additional thrust due to the slow acceleration characteristics of early jet engines. A fellow B-47 test pilot, Major Russell E. Schleeh, proposed a second parachute, deployed while in the landing pattern, to permit a higher engine power setting during the approach.|$|E
