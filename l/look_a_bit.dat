500|$|In her 2014 biography, Valerie Solanas, Breanne Fahs {{argues that}} it is {{unlikely}} that Solanas appeared at the Chelsea Hotel looking for Girodias. Fahs states that Girodias may have fabricated the account in order to boost sales of the SCUM Manifesto, which he had published. Fahs states that [...] "the more likely story ... places Valerie at the Actor's Studio at 432 West Forty-Fourth Street early that morning." [...] Actress Sylvia Miles states that Solanas appeared at the Actor's Studio looking for Lee Strasberg, asking to leave her play for him. Miles said that Solanas [...] "had a different <b>look,</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> tousled, like somebody whose appearance is the last thing on her mind." [...] Miles told Solanas that Strasberg would not be in until the afternoon. Miles said that she accepted a copy of the play from Solanas and then [...] "... shut the door because I knew she was trouble. I didn't know what sort of trouble, but I knew she was trouble." ...|$|E
500|$|Kyla was {{involved}} in three romantic relationships during her time in the show, {{the first of which}} was with physiotherapist Justin Fuller (Ben Richards). Ayola said of the relationship: [...] "She hasn't got great taste in men! She likes good-looking blokes - that whole 'take me to a cave' thing - but she doesn't check that there is a soft, gentle, sensitive side to him. He's gorgeous to look at, but she hasn't learned that you have to <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> deeper." [...] Roger Griffiths was cast as Kyla's ex-husband Harvey. Ayola commented on their previous relationship: [...] "I think they split up because Kyla is so volatile. The more we learn about Harvey the more I think he might not be the reason for their split". She expanded: [...] "They had a tempestuous relationship and Kyla is very irrational which got too much for Harvey. Harvey brings out the worst in Kyla and she just ends up yelling at him. It's a very difficult and if he knew how to handle her maybe it could work out but he doesn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Metroid Prime: Trilogy {{has also}} been subject to criticism. GamePros Ashley Schoeller said that graphically, [...] "the games do <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> dated" [...] and complained that the HUD was [...] "out of aspect" [...] to fit the widescreen. Official Nintendo Magazines Fred Dutton said that some aspects of Prime and Echoes had aged, saying the {{backtracking}} [...] "feels like more of a chore than it did seven years ago," [...] {{and that it is}} [...] "not until [...] enters its final third that things really start to pick up". GamesRadar considered the achievements too expensive, and that the similarity between the three games gives [...] "an inescapable sense of déjà vu". Edge noted that the control scheme was not very innovative, and that Echoes and Corruption [...] "favoured graphical flourishes over design innovation". While Ben Reeves of Game Informer praised the game, the [...] "second opinion" [...] reviewer, Adam Biessener, considered the collection [...] "subpar", saying it lacked innovation, and that the Wii control scheme, particularly aiming and panning, [...] "is inferior in every way to the traditional scheme from the GameCube titles".|$|E

500|$|Rihanna {{performed}} the {{song for the}} first time alongside Sugarland front woman Jennifer Nettles, at the ACM Awards held by the Academy of Country Music on April 3, 2011. She was also a special guest star on the tenth season of American Idol on April 14, 2011. The performance featured Rihanna in a floor-length, heavily textured rose-colored gown, which she adorned as she appeared from behind flowing ceiling height curtains. Kara Warner of MTV News complimented the performance, saying [...] "the 23-year-old rocked the house with an ethereal performance of her ballad 'California King Bed. A writer of Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "It's a classy, laid-back performance with Rihanna in a lovely gown, backed up by interpretative dancers caressing large pieces of fabric that are probably meant to evoke bed sheets, but <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more like giant strips of toilet paper hanging from the ceiling. But either way, this is quite nice." [...] In March 2011, Rihanna was appointed spokeswoman for the [...] "100 Years of Skin Care" [...] Nivea Commercial campaign, which featured [...] "California King Bed" [...] as the song used in the commercials. As part of promotion for the campaign, Rihanna {{performed the}} song at private events in several European cities in May 2011, including Hamburg, Milan and Paris. The song was also performed on NBC's Today show on May 27, 2011, as part of their Summer Concert Series. The set also featured Rihanna performing her previous US Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits from Loud; [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", [...] "What's My Name?" [...] and [...] "S". The song is included on the set-list of the Loud Tour (2011).|$|E
2500|$|Scott Wilkinson of AVS was {{similarly}} {{impressed by the}} visual effects (though he did not enjoy the movie itself): [...] "Even sitting too far away, the movie itself looked gorgeous—sharp as a tack with beautiful colors. The smallest details, such as Jaden Smith's character in the far distance, somehow looked clearer than I would have expected under normal circumstances; I got the distinct impression that the image could have been blown up by quite a bit and no detail would have been lost. The CGI animals did <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> artificial, but that didn't bother me very much at all." ...|$|E

[...] The Council has just dumped {{a huge amount of}} lagging, because [...] "it was in feet and inches, and we have gone metric". [...] Secombe, now in character as Neddie Seagoon, arrives [...] "driving an unlicensed Goon Show with CD plates on". [...] Gritpype's comment is [...] "Yes, it does <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> seedy, doesn't it." [...] The two villains then attempt their usual swindle of Neddie, in this case convincing him that his legs must be lagged to keep them warm for the coming winter, the payment being his [...] "war gratuity" [...] of one hundred pounds.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1994, {{a few months after}} the series {{underwent}} its format overhaul, the studio received a makeover to make it <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> warmer and more inviting, complete with brick walls, artwork, and bookcases. The stage walls were designed so that they could be projected outward into the audience, making room for a catwalk that was used in shows such as the 1998 episode Stripper Wars!. In late 2000 the whole set was changed again to its current [...] "industrial" [...] look, changes initially welcomed due to the reduced ratings of the 1999–2000 season. In 2007 the set was slightly changed, with a larger studio audience, bigger stage, and a balcony, which was above the stage and ended at the pole. Springer now uses this as his main entrance by sliding down the pole. The logo and stage design have been carried across to the new studio in Stamford, Connecticut with only a few changes.|$|E
2500|$|If {{there is}} a single {{criticism}} to be made of Gardner ... it is that he accepts too comfortably the conventional wisdom, or accepted social reality, of current twentieth-century science and middle-class American Christianity. Somehow it is evident (to me at least) that he is implicitly making a pact with the reader to evaluate these fringe groups in terms of their own shared presumptions about what is [...] "normal". Thus he is quite confident throwing around labels like [...] "quack", [...] "crank" [...] and [...] "preposterous". In science the use of such value judgments can be quite time-bound; likewise in religions where today's heresy may become tomorrow's orthodoxy. The odds of course are always {{on the side of the}} writer criticizing fringe groups because statistically speaking so few of them survive. However, when a group does weather its infancy and go on to prosper, invariably its original detractors <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more arbitrary than they did initially, and then the shoe is on the other foot.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Bolland was {{approached}} by Syd Jordan to ghost some episodes of Jordan's newspaper strip Jeff Hawke. (Fellow fandom-pro artist Paul Neary had [...] "already done quite a few.") Bolland drew 13 episodes, and [...] "Syd touched {{up some of the}} faces, a few details here and there, to make them <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more like him." [...] By this point, [...] "although the Express owned the rights to the strip, they were not printing it," [...] but since it had a strong European following, these new episodes (Bolland believes) [...] "got collected in anthologies in French and Spanish," [...] but not in the UK except briefly in [...] "the fanzine Eureka." [...] In 1985, as a known fan, Bolland {{was approached}} by Nick Landau to select stories and draw covers for two Titan collections of the strip, with a third design going unpublished. Bolland also contributed [...] "A Miracle of Elisha" [...] to Knockabout Comics' Old Bailey OZ Trial Special, written because Old Testament history had piqued the interest of Bolland when living near the British Museum. This page was later reprinted in the star-studded (Moore, Hunt Emerson, Gaiman, Gibbons, Dave McKean, etc.) Outrageous Tales From the Old Testament volume, although Bolland's name was left off the cover.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} years of scuba, each diver carried a single second-stage regulator, {{and in the case of}} an out of air {{emergency}} the buddy pair would make an emergency ascent to the surface while the two divers took turns buddy breathing from the mouthpiece of remaining functional scuba set. [...] Though this system worked effectively enough in a swimming pool or in open water practice sessions, and sometimes worked for skilled and disciplined divers in actual emergencies, in some cases the stress and physical difficulties of the situation caused this system to fail. [...] To simplify the procedure for air sharing, the recreational diving industry moved to a configuration that provided each diver an additional second-stage regulator, as a backup to the primary; the backup is known variously as the [...] "octopus stage", [...] "backup", [...] "secondary" [...] or [...] "safe second" [...] (obsolescent). The term octopus came about because with several regulator and other hoses hanging from the first stage, the unit started to <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> like an octopus. [...] Two general systems have evolved for carrying and deploying the backup demand valve – one more prevalent in recreational diving and the other commonly found in technical diving (although some crossover exists). In both systems, each diver carries two demand valves. They may be attached to the first-stage regulator of a single tank or to two first stage regulators of twin cylinders. The primary regularor is used for normal breathing during the dive and the secondary regulator ("octopus") is a backup for oneself or for the out-of-air buddy.|$|E
