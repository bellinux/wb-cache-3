Skilled users of AAC show communicative competence in four interrelated areas: linguistic, operational, social and strategic. <b>Linguistic</b> <b>competence</b> refers to language skills in the person's native language {{as well as the}} linguistic code of the symbol system selected. Operational competence involves the skills in the use and maintenance of the tool of communication, while social competence and strategic competence reflect knowledge and judgment in communicative interactions, including the compensations required for a slow speaking rate, communication breakdowns and those unfamiliar with AAC. An AAC user may require specific device programming and/or training to achieve competency in these areas.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the relationship between foreign language teacher (FL) and learner <b>linguistic</b> <b>competences.</b> While the assessment of FL learner <b>linguistic</b> <b>competences</b> is very common, assessing FL teachers is rather a controversial topic. Although there are some studies into FL teacher <b>linguistic</b> <b>competences,</b> their use {{in the classroom and}} their effect on learner language achievements are rarely studied. However, such studies would provide significant feedback to FL policy makers and teacher educators so as to ensure the quality and the success of FLL. Our research study, therefore, sought to assess English language learner linguistic achievements in connection to their teacher <b>linguistic</b> <b>competences</b> in the Croatian context. The research drew upon the data collected within the longitudinal and transnational project Early Language Learning in Europe (ELLiE). The study sample consisted of two generalist teachers who teach lower primary English in two small-town primary schools and four of their learners respectively. Over the first four years of FLL we carried out qualitative analysis of teacher <b>linguistic</b> <b>competences</b> based on classroom observations and teacher interviews. The interaction task, carried {{out at the end of}} the fourth year of English language learning, enabled, on the other hand, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of learner oral production. The results obtained were compared and the relationship between teacher and learner <b>linguistic</b> <b>competences</b> was established.

40|$|In today’s globalized societies, {{characterized}} by increased translingual, multimodal and sometimes fast-paced communication, the concept “linguistic competences” {{has become a}} highly prolific notion. It is frequently invoked as the remedy {{for all sorts of}} problems, and lack thereof is seen as the root of all evils (Cameron 2000 a). This paper offers a critical sociolinguistic approach to the notion of <b>linguistic</b> <b>competences.</b> It asks what people actually mean by “linguistic competences” and why it has apparently become such a central concept in contemporary society. Drawing on examples from two contexts, the globalized call centre industry and the eight internationalized universities of Denmark, the paper first examines the meaning of <b>linguistic</b> <b>competences.</b> Here, it finds that a strengthening of <b>linguistic</b> <b>competences</b> is hailed as the same solution to problems which are very different in nature and which are perceived to exist in both the call centres and the universities. Drawing on Cameron’s notion of “verbal hygiene” (2012 a), it then proposes that the preoccupation with language, and more specifically with <b>linguistic</b> <b>competences,</b> may be interpreted as a symbolic act for a much more fundamental urge of human being to put the world to right. In this interpretation, interventions in the social order come to be conflated with interventions in the social order come to be conflated with interventions in language, and more specifically in <b>linguistic</b> <b>competences...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the associations between the speaking proficiency of 181 adult learners of Dutch {{as a second}} language and their <b>linguistic</b> <b>competences.</b> Performance in eight speaking tasks was rated on a scale of communicative adequacy. After extrapolation of these ratings to the Overall Oral Production scale of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) (Council of Europe, 2001), 80 and 30 participants (on average per speaking task) were found to be, respectively, at the B 1 and B 2 levels of this scale. The following <b>linguistic</b> <b>competences</b> were tapped with non-communicative tasks: productive vocabulary knowledge, productive knowledge of grammar, speed of lexical retrieval, speed of articulation, speed of sentence building, and pronunciation skills. Discriminant analyses showed that all <b>linguistic</b> <b>competences,</b> except speed of articulation, discriminated participants at the two levels of oral production. Subsequent comparisons showed that the distance between B 1 ers and B 2 ers was smaller in knowledge of high-frequency words than in knowledge of medium- and low-frequency words. Extrapolation from scores on the vocabulary test yielded estimations of productive vocabularies of, on average, 4000 and 7000 words for B 1 ers and B 2 ers, respectively. The grammar test assessed grammatical knowledge in 10 domains. B 2 ers were found to outperform B 1 ers on all parts of the test. Thus, the differences in lexical and grammatical knowledge of B 1 ers and B 2 ers appear {{to be a matter of}} degree, rather than a matter of category or domain.

Fish's work in this field examines how the interpretation of a text is dependent upon each reader's own subjective experience in one or more communities, each of which is defined as a 'community' by a distinct epistemology. For Fish, a large part of what renders a reader’s subjective experience valuable — that is, why it may be considered “constrained” as opposed to an uncontrolled and idiosyncratic assertion of the self — comes from a concept native to the field of linguistics called <b>linguistic</b> <b>competence.</b> In Fish’s source the term is explained as “the idea that it is possible to characterize a linguistic system that every speaker shares.” In the context of literary criticism, Fish uses this concept to argue that a reader’s approach to a text is not completely subjective, and that an internalized understanding of language shared by the native speakers of that given language makes possible the creation of normative boundaries for one’s experience with language.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1960s, Chomsky {{introduced}} two central ideas {{relevant to}} the construction and evaluation of grammatical theories. The first was the distinction between competence and performance. Chomsky noted the obvious fact that people, when speaking in the real world, often make linguistic errors (e.g., starting a sentence and then abandoning it midway through). He argued that these errors in linguistic performance were ir{{relevant to the}} study of <b>linguistic</b> <b>competence</b> (the knowledge that allows people to construct and understand grammatical sentences). Consequently, the linguist can study an idealised version of language, greatly simplifying linguistic analysis (see the [...] "Grammaticality" [...] section below). The second idea related directly to the evaluation of theories of grammar. Chomsky distinguished between grammars that achieve descriptive adequacy and those that go further and achieved explanatory adequacy. A descriptively adequate grammar for a particular language defines the (infinite) set of grammatical sentences in that language; that is, it describes the language in its entirety. A grammar that achieves explanatory adequacy has the additional property that it gives an insight into the underlying linguistic structures in the human mind; that is, it does not merely describe the grammar of a language, but makes predictions about how linguistic knowledge is mentally represented. For Chomsky, the nature of such mental representations is largely innate, so if a grammatical theory has explanatory adequacy it must be able to explain the various grammatical nuances of the languages of the world as relatively minor variations in the universal pattern of human language. Chomsky argued that, even though linguists were still a long way from constructing descriptively adequate grammars, progress in terms of descriptive adequacy will only come if linguists hold explanatory adequacy as their goal. In other words, real insight into the structure of individual languages can only be gained through comparative study {{of a wide range of}} languages, on the assumption that they are all cut from the same cloth.|$|E
