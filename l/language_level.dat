5|$|PHP has {{received}} criticism due to lacking native Unicode support {{at the core}} <b>language</b> <b>level,</b> instead only supporting byte strings. In 2005, a project headed by Andrei Zmievski was initiated to bring native Unicode support throughout PHP, by embedding the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library, and representing text strings as UTF-16 internally. Since this would cause major changes both to the internals of the language and to user code, it was planned to release this as version 6.0 of the language, along with other major features then in development.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of <b>language</b> <b>levels,</b> a pedagogic tool that helps students progressively learn object-oriented programming concepts in discrete stages. While Java is widely used in academia, its complex syntax and large array of constructs are difficult for beginning students to learn. The <b>language</b> <b>levels</b> facility supports a hierarchy of progressively sophisticated subsets of the language. This progression minimizes the clerical burden involved in learning to write Java programs and reinforces the specific abstractions taught at each stage of Rice introductory programming curriculum. In addition, the hierarchy of <b>language</b> <b>levels</b> reduces code clutter by automatically generating routine methods. This <b>language</b> <b>levels</b> facility has been implemented {{as an extension of}} DrJava, a pedagogic programming environment for Java developed at Rice University. We anticipate that this extension will enable more students to learn Java and master the principles of object-oriented programming...|$|R
40|$|We {{distinguish}} different {{features in}} lexeme content which correspond to {{different types of}} features generated on various <b>language</b> <b>levels.</b> The content of a lexeme in system is limited to its inherent features implied from idealised relations of identity and opposition between words. The content of a lexeme in usage depends on extraindividual linguistic associations which are beyond pure systemic contents. The content in discourse may contain also occasional features which can be totally different from systemic or usage contents. However, this various types of lexeme features specific to different <b>language</b> <b>levels</b> still belong to one lexeme in one language. This circulation of notions: 1 <b>language</b> «-* different <b>levels</b> and I content - various features rises a question: {{is it possible to}} make one semantics for one language and for one lexeme content. In the paper we want to present different methods of lexeme features analysis specific to particular <b>language</b> <b>levels</b> and to describe a tentative to obtain one method for the analysis of all types of lexeme features on all <b>language</b> <b>levels.</b> The aim of the paper is to show serious paradoxes due to confusion of different <b>language</b> <b>levels</b> and its typical contents. It is an evidence th at it is impossible to obtain a consistent universal semantics giving tools for description and analysis of lexeme contents on all <b>language</b> <b>levels</b> together.

DrJava is a lightweight, yet powerful, Java development environment suitable both for beginners and more advanced developers.

The methodology involves expert opinions on <b>language</b> <b>levels</b> and extending these opinions to other words using machine learning and data from a large corpus. Common European Framework for <b>Languages</b> (CEFR) <b>level</b> predictions for about 50 000 words, which can be readily used in educational applications, are also provided. For applications where the cost of misclassification varies, machine learning model parameters and algorithm selection must be adjusted. A large number of expert opinions taken from a survey with 30 practicing language teachers {{that can be used}} for this adjustment are also released. The overall methodology can be applied to low-resource languages, where CEFR-level classifications may not exist, by adding a comparable survey and corpus.
