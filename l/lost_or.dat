The night attack was successful, and Custer's division captured 24 to 30 artillery pieces. About 1,000 Confederates were taken prisoner, and 150 to 200 wagons were captured.|$|E

5|$|Many {{meanings}} {{have been}} suggested for the advent and nature of prehistoric art. It may have helped develop human solidarity in its early stages.

Portable objects may have acted as notation systems and anthropomorphic figures may have had a role in religious rituals. However, most artifacts can only be understood in their context, which is often <b>lost</b> <b>or</b> poorly understood.|$|E

5|$|On July15, the {{hurricane}} moved ashore near Matagorda Bay in Texas, with winds estimated around 105mph (165km/h), or a Category2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. At landfall, the minimum barometric pressure {{was estimated at}} 969mbar (28.61inHg). The hurricane's strong winds broke all of the boats from their moorings in the Matagorda harbor. Four ships were either <b>lost</b> <b>or</b> wrecked, and one schooner was washed ashore. The storm dissipated early on July16 after progressing further inland.|$|E

5|$|While Ovid's {{retelling of}} the myth is the more famous version of the story, he had several ancient sources on which to rely before he {{finished}} the Metamorphoses in A.D. 8.

In his version, Ovid recast and combined many elements from these ancient sources. Because his is the most complete, lasting version {{of the myth}}, it {{is the basis for}} many later works.|$|E
