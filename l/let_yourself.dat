500|$|A 30-second clip for the {{fragrance}} surfaced on the Internet in January 2014 and several publications reported and speculated {{it would be}} the commercial for Rise. A commercial was later officially released in February and was shot by Jake Nava with whom Beyoncé had collaborated frequently. It opens with shots of her showered in gold as she rises out of a glittering bowl formed of dust while dramatic music plays in the background; several of the scenes are filmed using a slow motion technique. Her voiceover is heard in the background, [...] "You can <b>let</b> <b>yourself</b> disappear, or you can stir things up. Never settle, shake loose. Embrace the elements. Because from now on, you will always Rise!". Beyoncé is seen surrounded by glittery ashes, wearing thigh-high gladiator sandals and a bodysuit noted to be Amazonian-inspired.|$|E
500|$|In June 2004, Bloc Party convened at Deltalab Studios in Copenhagen to make Silent Alarm with Paul Epworth. The {{band had}} already written demo songs to record, but Okereke {{has noted that}} [...] "it is a {{creative}} process {{and you have to}} <b>let</b> <b>yourself</b> be inspired while you're in the studio as well". The Deltalab set-up posed problems, because it included bare mains cables and dated, malfunctioning equipment from the 1960s and 1970s. Bloc Party took three sessions to get acquainted with Epworth's methodology. The producer has called the recording time a [...] "growing process" [...] because Okereke was not wholly comfortable singing in front of people, especially after tonsil problems. Although the band members had preliminary ideas about a track's rhythm, they did not know how songs were going to start or end. Okereke often asked Tong to play something on the drums, which inspired him to mould a track by adding guitar chords to the beat.|$|E

2500|$|Gone Girl's themes include dishonesty, the devious media, and the {{unhappiness}} {{that comes}} with a troubled economy. The characters lie to each other and the reader about affairs and disappearances. Amy fabricates a fake diary to implicate her husband for her disappearance and murder. Flynn says that, in writing the book, she wanted to examine how people within a marriage lie to each other: [...] "marriage is sort of like a long con, because you put on display your very best self during courtship, {{yet at the same time}} the person you marry is supposed to love you warts and all. But your spouse never sees those warts really until you get deeper into the marriage and <b>let</b> <b>yourself</b> unwind a bit." ...|$|E

It got to me. I'm still trying to decide whether I was won over or worn down— but why not give Sheridan the benefit of the doubt? [...] [...] [...] [...] is clearly drawing on deep personal reserves for this picture, and despite a few sequences when the creative hand seems intrusive, does well by his subject.

Ben Rimalower, in Playbill, wrote that, for Glinda, [...] "the gold standard was unquestionably and indelibly set" [...] by Chenoweth's performances. After playing Glinda for nine months, Chenoweth left Wicked, on , 2004, soon joining the cast of The West Wing in Los Angeles. The Wicked cast album earned a 2005 Grammy Award.|$|E
2500|$|Returning from Europe in 1944, Block {{resumed his}} writing career. Block was the producer, {{as well as}} writer, of Milton Berle's radio show, <b>Let</b> <b>Yourself</b> Go. The show was {{described}} as a [...] "zany, exhibitionist program" [...] similar to the children's game Forfeits in which audience members and famous guests acted out unusual behavior. [...] On one show, Berle promised to buy a $1,000 war bond if Opera Star Grace Moore would perform while standing on her head. With the help of Berle and announcer Kenneth Roberts holding her feet, she did a handstand as Block held the microphone while she sang. In September 1944, Block was the writer for Ed Wynn's program Happy Island, which was Wynn's return to radio after a decade absence. Also in 1944, Block wrote the song Buy a Bond Today. Around 1948, Block wrote the material for an album for Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis which was to be used as their audition for entry into television. [...] Block also attained what columnist Hedda Hopper described as a [...] "cushy deal" [...] at a major film studio.|$|E

2500|$|According to Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine, {{the song}} is [...] "an ode to S". It begins with a [...] "put-a-record-on scratchiness" [...] sound that mimics a record player. Following this, Madonna says, [...] "My name is Dita", as she invites her lover to be passive and childlike while she makes love to him and leads him to explore {{boundaries}} between pain and pleasure. Madonna's use of the pseudonym [...] "Mistress Dita" [...] in the song, {{as well as in}} [...] Sex, is a homage to Dita Parlo, a German actress who was known for [...] "not caring what people thought". The song has suggestive lyrics, such as [...] "Will you <b>let</b> <b>yourself</b> go wild/Let my mouth go where it wants to". Slant Magazine described these lyrics as [...] "taunting, aggressive—an elaborate exploration of sex, from seduction to disease". A similar song titled [...] "Erotic", was created during the Erotica album sessions exclusively to accompany the 1992 book Sex. The song, a stripped-down version of [...] "Erotica", includes lyrics not heard in the original track such as [...] "We could use the cage, I've got a lot of rope".

2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel like. You are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or that {{you want it to be}} like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will feel as if you are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and don't <b>let</b> <b>yourself</b> want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lead Singer John Cooper {{said this}} about the song. 'I am really excited about this song, which is {{probably}} the most overtly Christian song on the album. I think “Forgiven” is a very hopeful song, and even though it’s not the first time a song has been written on the subject, it strikes a balance between being very worship oriented and honest as well.

2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you <b>let</b> <b>yourself</b> be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.

[...] The song is written in drop C tuning, and was noted by the Ultimate Guitar Team for its heavy bass riff.
