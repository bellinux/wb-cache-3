For the past decade, Faraday filters have been used to do this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF.|$|E
40|$|Space <b>lidars</b> {{provides}} {{a unique and}} powerful tool in earth environment monitoring and planetary exploration. <b>Lidars</b> operate at a much shorter wavelength than radars and can have a much narrower beam and much smaller transmitter and receiver. <b>Lidars</b> carry their own light sources and can continue measurement day and night, and over polar regions, where the passive instruments cannot observe. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has developed several space <b>lidars,</b> three of them on planetary missions. These were the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) on the Mars Observer and Mars Global Surveyor missions, the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) on the MErcury Surface Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission and the Lunar Orbital Laser Altimeter (LOLA) on the Lunar Reconnaissance (LRO) mission.

40|$|The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is {{the next}} {{generation}} of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. It will reach a sensitivity and energy resolution never obtained until now by any other high energy gamma-ray experiment. Understanding the systematic uncertainties in general will be a crucial issue for the performance of CTA. It is well known that atmospheric conditions contribute particularly in this aspect. Within the CTA consortium several groups are currently building Raman <b>LIDARs</b> to be installed on the two sites. Raman <b>LIDARs</b> are devices composed of a powerful laser that shoots into the atmosphere, a collector that gathers the backscattered light from molecules and aerosols, a photo-sensor, an optical module that spectrally selects wavelengths of interest, and a read [...] out system. Unlike currently used elastic <b>LIDARs,</b> they can help reduce the systematic uncertainties of the molecular and aerosol components of the atmosphere to < 5 % so that CTA can achieve its energy resolution requirements of< 10 % uncertainty at 1 TeV. All the Raman <b>LIDARs</b> in this work have design features that make them different than typical Raman <b>LIDARs</b> used in atmospheric science and are characterized by large collecting mirrors (2. 5 m 2) and reduced acquisition time. They provide both multiple elastic and Raman read-out channels and custom made optics design. In this paper, the motivation for Raman <b>LIDARs,</b> the design and the status of advance of these technologies are described. Comment: All CTA contributions at arXiv: 1709. 0348...|$|R

5|$|Visual effects editor Marc Varisco, who had {{previously}} collaborated with director Scott on the 2005 film Domino, worked again with Scott to develop Déjà Vu into a fully-fledged work. In total, approximately 400 visual effects scenes were shot during the production of Déjà Vu. They had acquired a <b>LIDAR</b> device, which incorporated lasers to scatter light {{with the intent of}} mapping out a small region, during the production of Domino; Scott and Varisco decided to use the apparatus again during the production of Déjà Vu. Additionally, the two utilized the Panavision Genesis high definition camera to film the shots that would encompass the past that the Snow White team would peer at throughout the film, as well as the various night scenes. The <b>LIDAR</b> apparatus, which was operated by a hired Texan company devoted to the device, performed scans of Claire Kuchever's apartment, the ferry, the ATF office, and actress Paula Patton, among others. Effects editor Zachary Tucker combined the elements created by the Texan <b>LIDAR</b> company with computer-generated graphics to make possible the scenes of time-travel experienced in the film.|$|E

40|$|Modeling of the {{systematic}} {{errors in the}} second-order moments of wind speeds measured by continuouswave (ZephIR) and pulsed (WindCube) <b>lidars</b> is presented. These <b>lidars</b> use the conical scanning technique to measure the velocity field. The model captures the effect of volume illumination and conical scanning. The predictions are compared with the measurements from the ZephIR, WindCube, and sonic anemometers at a flat terrain test site under different atmospheric stability conditions. The sonic measurements are used at several heights on a meteorological mast in combination with <b>lidars</b> that are placed on the ground. Results show that {{the systematic}} errors are up to 90 % for the vertical velocity variance, whereas they are up to 70 % for the horizontal velocity variance. For the ZephIR, the systematic errors increase with height, whereas for the WindCube, they decrease with height. The systematic errors also vary with atmospheric stability and are low for unstable conditions. In general, for both <b>lidars,</b> the model agrees well with the measurements at all heights and under different atmospheric stability conditions. For the ZephIR, the model results are improved when an additional low-pass filter for the 3 -s scan is also modeled. It is concluded that with the current measurement configuration, these <b>lidars</b> cannot be used to measure turbulence precisely. Aerodynamics and Wind EnergyAerospace Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an environment-detection-and-mapping algorithm for autonomous driving that {{is provided in}} real time and for both rural and off-road environments. Environment-detection-and-mapping algorithms have been de-signed to consist of two parts: 1) lane, pedestrian-crossing, and speed-bump detection algorithms using cameras and 2) obstacle detection algorithm using <b>LIDARs.</b> The lane detection algorithm returns lane positions using one camera and the vision module “VisLab Embedded Lane Detector (VELD), ” and the pedestrian-crossing and speed-bump detection algorithms return the position of pedestrian crossings and speed bumps. The obstacle detection algorithm organizes data from <b>LIDARs</b> and generates a local obstacle position map.
