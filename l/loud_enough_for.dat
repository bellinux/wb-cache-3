25|$|Electronic {{music is}} music that employs {{electronic}} musical instruments, digital instruments and circuitry-based music technology. An electronic musician is a musician who composes or performs such music. In general, a distinction {{can be made}} between sound produced using electromechanical means, such as violins and drums, and that produced using electronic technology. Electromechanical instruments include mechanical elements, such as strings, hammers, and so on, and electric elements, such as magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar, which are typically made <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> performers and audiences to hear with an instrument amplifier and speaker cabinet. Pure electronic instruments do not have vibrating strings, hammers, or other sound-producing mechanisms. Devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer can produce electronic sounds.|$|E
25|$|According to {{classical}} rabbinical literature, {{in order for}} the Urim and Thummim to give an answer, it was first necessary for the individual to stand facing the fully dressed high priest, and vocalise the question briefly and in a simple way, though it was not necessary for it to be <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> anyone else to hear it. The Talmudic rabbis argued that Urim and Thummim were words written on the sacred breastplate. Most of the Talmudic rabbis, and Josephus, following the belief that Urim meant lights, argued that divination by Urim and Thummim involved questions being answered by great rays of light shining out of certain jewels on the breastplate; each jewel was taken to represent different letters, and the sequence of lighting thus would spell out an answer (though there were 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet, and only 12 jewels on the breastplate); two Talmudic rabbis, however, argued that the jewels themselves moved {{in a way that made}} them stand out from the rest, or even moved themselves into groups to form words.|$|E

His attempts at building the house frustrate Homer, and he curses <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Todd to overhear. After Todd says [...] "hell no" [...] and [...] "damn" [...] at dinner, his father Ned eventually discovers that he learned those words from Homer. He complains to Homer, who in turn criticizes Ned's mustache. Ned promises to shave off his mustache in return for Homer curtailing uses of profanity. He promises to put money in a [...] "swear jar" [...] - 25 cents for each curse.|$|E

500|$|A {{writer of}} Rap-Up {{magazine}} {{noted that the}} remix of the song which was featured on the mixtape Big R Ego was [...] "potent, but not quite fatal". Eskridge of Sister 2 Sister wrote in her review of the song that [...] "we can't help but wonder why {{it would have been}} cut". Matthew Richardson of Prefix Magazine noted, [...] "As far as songs that got left in the studio, 'Poison' actually isn't that bad. The song's production isn't <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> this to be a single, but Beyonce sounds fine here." [...] Nia Beckwith of the website AllHipHop gave a positive review about the song, saying that it was [...] "the most noteworthy" [...] track she heard during the week of its premiere. She wrote, ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, gigging musicians were finding that older Leslies like the 122 were not <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> large venues, {{which led to}} the {{introduction}} of the [...] "Pro Line" [...] series. These Leslies had louder solid-state power amplifiers, and were mounted on casters for ease of portability. The first models Leslie manufactured were the 900 and 910, which contained a 100 watt, three-channel power amplifier. Both could split into two sections. The most popular version of the Pro-Line series was the 760. It was a smaller version of the 900 and 910, and contained a 40 watt treble and 50 watt bass amplifier. A smaller, more portable version of the 760 is the 820. It is a solid-state cabinet like the 760, and it connects to the organ with a 9-pin connector as well. However, it is only [...] high and has only a single rotor with a full-range 12-inch speaker.|$|E
2500|$|The {{guideline}} {{of silent}} prayer comes from Hannah's behavior during prayer, when she prayed in the Temple {{to bear a}} child. She prayed [...] "speaking upon her heart," [...] {{so that no one}} else could hear, yet her lips were moving. Therefore, when saying the Amidah one's voice should be audible to oneself, but not <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> others to hear.|$|E

Originally Swift and Caillat were only to harmonize in the chorus, but as Caillat recorded, Swift decided to include her voice more throughout the track because of how impressed she was. Swift first recorded the entire song, and Caillat then recorded background vocals separately. Swift was {{very pleased with the}} finished product: [...] "I think she sounds beautiful on it. I'm so excited to have her voice on my album." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Anklebiters" [...] has {{received}} acclaim from music critics. Popdust gave the song a 4.5/5, commenting that {{the song was}} an [...] "upbeat, scream-along return to Paramore's emo-punk roots", and calling the song's atmosphere [...] "perfect for psyching yourself up before leaving {{the house for a}} nerve-wracking night on the town". MTV Buzzworthy says [...] "A fuzzy, scrappy track that starts in The Strokes' garage and kicks away the haters: [...] "Why do you care what people think?" [...] Williams rips. Good question. Turn this one up <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> and <b>for</b> 2 minutes and 17 seconds, you won't." [...] Billboard Magazine elaborated on the title's meaning, saying that [...] "the hip-hop community refers to naysayers as [...] "Haters," [...] but Paramore calls them [...] "Anklebiters"—folks who prey on other people's actions. [...] "Someday you're going to be the only one that you've got," [...] Williams sings to those that should rely on their own thoughts and not what anklebiters are saying".|$|R

Claude threw himself down on the sofa to enjoy the luxury of a desultory talk with his sisters; and Reginald, his head on the floor, and his heels on a chair, talked <b>loud</b> and fast <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> all three, with very little regard to what the damsels might be saying.|$|R
2500|$|Envoys {{were sent}} to the Samnites with the {{introductions}} to request that they, in view of their mutual friendship with Rome, spare territory which had become the possession of Rome and, if this was not heeded, to warn them to keep their hands off the city of Capua and the territory of Campania. [...] The envoys delivered their message as instructed to the Samnites' national assembly. [...] They were met with a defiant response, [...] "not only did the Samnites declare their intention of waging war against Capua, but their magistrates left the council chamber, and in tones <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the envoys to hear, ordered [...] to march out at once into Campanian territory and ravage it." [...] When this news reached Rome, the fetials {{were sent to}} demand redress, and when this was refused [...] Rome declared war against the Samnites.|$|E
2500|$|John F. Montgomery, {{who served}} in Budapest as U.S. {{ambassador}} from 1933 to 1941, openly admired this side of Horthy's character and reported the following incident in his memoir: in March 1939, Arrow Cross supporters disrupted a performance at the Budapest opera house by chanting [...] "Justice for Szálasi!" [...] <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the regent to hear. A fight broke out, and when Montgomery went {{to take a closer}} look, he discovered that:two or three men were on the floor and he [...] had another by the throat, slapping his face and shouting what I learned afterward was: [...] "So you would betray your country, would you?" [...] The Regent was alone, but he had the situation in hand.... The whole incident was typical not only of the Regent's deep hatred of alien doctrine, but of the kind of man he is. Although he was around seventy two years of age, it did not occur to him to ask for help; he went right ahead like a skipper with a mutiny on his hands.|$|E
2500|$|Catherine Gordon {{was taught}} to read {{at a young age}} and had a passion for literature, a passion she shared with her son. Byron would read through the Bible, {{focusing}} predominantly on the Old Testament, and he would also read works dealing with history or narrative tales like the Arabian Nights. However this passion for reading was not the only passion mother and child shared; Catherine was also known for having a violent temper. The son inherited his mother's temper but he would not speak while he experienced various fits. On one occasion, the young Byron bit off a piece of a china saucer during his [...] "silent rage". Byron's problems were compounded by his mother's lack of money, especially with her having to provide for her delinquent husband. When word reached her that John Byron had died, she cried out <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> her neighbourhood to hear. However, her troubles were not over, for in his final moments John Byron had incurred even more debt, which burdened his widow to the point of having to move to another home in worse conditions.|$|E
25|$|The dulcian is a {{flexible}} instrument, {{capable of being}} <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> to play in outdoor bands, quiet <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> chamber music, and expressive enough to join in with the choir. Its uses would have included playing dance music with the shawms and sackbuts of the city watch, chamber music, and the grand polychoral repertoire from Venice and Germany, such as Giovanni Gabrieli and Heinrich Schütz. There are explicit dulcian parts in the sonatas by Dario Castello.|$|R

However, the pillars are from another local quarry, as the Adams quarry was not deep <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a full-height pillar. Its original bell was cast by Paul Revere, but was melted down and recast as it was not <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> to serve as a fire alarm. The unusual domed ceiling represents a passion flower surrounded by lotuses. The fine mahogany altar is original.|$|R
2500|$|At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Reynolds {{clashed with}} Maj. Gen. Hooker, his {{predecessor}} at I Corps, but {{by this time}} the commander of the Army of the Potomac. Hooker originally placed the I Corps on the extreme left of the Union line, southeast of Fredericksburg, hoping to threaten and distract the Confederate right. On May 2, Hooker changed his mind and ordered the corps to conduct a daylight march nearly 20 miles to swing around and become the extreme right flank of the army, to the northwest of the XI Corps. The march was delayed by faulty communications and by the need to move stealthily to avoid Confederate contact. Thus, the I Corps was not yet in position when the XI Corps was surprised and overrun by Lt. Gen. Thomas J. [...] "Stonewall" [...] Jackson's flank attack, a setback that destroyed Hooker's nerve for offensive action. Hooker called a council of war on May 4 in which Reynolds voted to proceed with the battle, but although the vote was three to two for offensive action, Hooker decided to retreat. Reynolds, who had gone to sleep after giving his proxy vote to Meade, woke up and muttered <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Hooker to hear, [...] "What was the use of calling us together at this time of night when he intended to retreat anyhow?" [...] The 17,000-man I Corps was not engaged at Chancellorsville and suffered only 300 casualties during the entire campaign.|$|E
