2500|$|The {{day after}} the {{collision}} and ship's sinking, P agreed with the insurers' salvage team to send divers to recover the gold and silver ingots. Divers initially entered the Captain's cabin and opened his safe, to recover {{the keys to the}} ship's five strongrooms. This enabled them to open three of the five strongrooms, while the other two were opened with a <b>lump</b> <b>hammer</b> and cold chisel. The salvage operation lasted ten days. A notable history item of the day, the salvage operation was filmed by George Albert Smith of Brighton, using his new and innovative [...] "Kinemacolor" [...] system, the first successful colour motion picture process.|$|E
50|$|Mjolnir was {{typically}} {{depicted as a}} large, square-headed gray <b>lump</b> <b>hammer.</b> It has a short, round handle wrapped in brown leather, culminating in a looped lanyard. The object is based on Mj√∂lnir, the weapon of the mythological Thor.|$|E
5000|$|New Order seen {{changing}} an Emulator {{floppy disk}} during a live performance of [...] "Blue Monday" [...] (choir sample) on Top of the Pops. The band often used it live and the disk drives would stop working, prompting their keyboard player Gillian Gilbert {{to hit the}} sampler stand's leg with a <b>lump</b> <b>hammer</b> which fixed the problem ...|$|E
50|$|If {{the amount}} of gold used for the hat was moulded into a square bar, it would only measure 2.5 cm square. Such a bar or <b>lump</b> was <b>hammered</b> to the thickess of a modern sheet of {{printing}} paper during its production.|$|R
5000|$|The {{malleability}} of gold is extraordinary: a fist sized <b>lump</b> can be <b>hammered</b> {{and separated}} into one million paper back sized sheets, each 10 nm thick, 1600 times thinner than regular kitchen aluminium foil (0.016 mm thick).|$|R
60|$|It fell in oblique {{lines of}} ragged <b>lumps</b> of ice, <b>hammering</b> upon {{the wagon and}} {{bringing}} the horses to a stop. They began to plunge, turning half round, while one pressed against the other, {{in an effort to}} escape the savage buffeting. Festing let them have their way at the risk of upsetting the rig, and presently they stopped with their backs to the wind. He let the reins fall, and the hail beat upon his bowed head and shoulders like a shower of stones. The horses stood limp and trembling, as powerless as himself.|$|R
50|$|A {{drilling}} hammer, club hammer, <b>lump</b> <b>hammer,</b> crack hammer, mini-sledge or thor hammer {{is a small}} sledgehammer whose relatively {{light weight}} and short handle allow single-handed use. It is useful for light demolition work, driving masonry nails, and for use with a steel chisel when cutting stone or metal. In this last application, its weight drives the chisel more deeply into the material being cut than lighter hammers. Club hammers are common on the British inland waterways for driving mooring pins into the towpath or canal bank.|$|E

5000|$|Pocket Gamer {{scored the}} game 9 out of 10, also {{giving it a}} [...] "Gold Award". Reviewer Harry Slater {{compared}} the game to Real Racing 3, arguing [...] "If Real Racing 3 is a precision instrument, then Asphalt 8: Airborne is a <b>lump</b> <b>hammer</b> ... there's a simple arcade glory to the proceedings, which leaves you {{with a smile on}} your face after every breathtaking dash to the line. So while Asphalt 8: Airborne might not be subtle, every second you spend in its company is exhilarating fun." [...] He praised the level design, control options, the nitro system, and the use of shortcuts on every track. He concluded that [...] "Asphalt 8: Airborne might not be the best-looking racer out there, and it certainly isn't the most realistic, but as an arcade blast it's hard to top. Its powerslides are that bit madder, its jumps that bit more ludicrous, and its takedowns that more satisfying than its nearest competitors. This is a racer that concentrates on fun above anything else, and it hits its mark almost every time. If you're a fan of gaming with a grin on your face, then Asphalt 8: Airborne is going to be right up your street." ...|$|E
