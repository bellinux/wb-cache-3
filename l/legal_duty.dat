5|$|The English {{common law}} {{position}} that a public body cannot fetter its discretion by abdicating its responsibility and powers to another was discussed and adopted in Lines International. The general rules that Justice Prakash enunciated {{in the case}} are that, first, a public body has the duty to exercise discretion by itself; it cannot abdicate this responsibility by taking orders from other bodies unless it is under a <b>legal</b> <b>duty</b> to do so. Therefore, a condition in its policy {{that appeared to be}} a direction by the PSA to itself to take orders from either the Gambling Suppression Branch ("GSB") of the Singapore Police Force or STPB to deny berths to cruise vessels was a fetter on PSA's exercise of discretion and was held to be invalid. However, the invalid condition alone did not mean that the PSA had in fact fettered its discretion. The High Court stated that while the PSA had agreed to take orders from the GSB and STPB {{on the basis of the}} invalid condition, whether it had in fact done so was another matter. On the evidence, the Court went on to find that the PSA had in fact made its own decision in the matter.|$|E

25|$|In Lines International, the High Court {{held that}} since the Port of Singapore Authority was the {{authority}} vested with control over berths for vessels, it could not abdicate its responsibility by taking orders from other statutory boards unless it was under a <b>legal</b> <b>duty</b> to do so. If, on the evidence, a court concludes that an authority has fettered its discretion by acting under dictation from other people or bodies, its decision will be invalid.

25|$|A related {{concept is}} that under American jurisprudence, {{different}} standards of proof are required in {{civil and criminal}} proceedings. Normally, to be convicted of a crime, the defendant {{must have had a}} specific mens rea, or guilty mental state. For criminal violations of the income tax law, this generally means that the prohibited conduct (whether failure to file, failure to pay, or engaging in some affirmative act to evade the tax), must have been accompanied by an intentional violation of a <b>legal</b> <b>duty</b> of which the defendant was aware. By contrast, to establish civil liability to pay the tax, no mens rea {{on the part of the}} defendant is required to be proven.|$|E

The decision-maker must carry out the consultation with an open mind, but is not bound by views expressed to it.|$|E
25|$|France's Cour des Comptes, a state {{spending}} 'watchdog' charged with conducting financial and legislative audits {{of public and}} private institutions, accused the museums of failing in their <b>legal</b> <b>duty</b> to seek out the owners or heirs of the works, including paintings by Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and sculptures by Auguste Rodin. In an attempt to rebut the charges, French authorities put 900 of the MNRs on exhibit in five national museums, including The Louvre and the Pompidou Centre. Gleizes' Paysage à Meudon was among them. The state-museum network explained that few or none of the works in its possession were looted from Jews, but were sold to the Nazis by collaborationist dealers in the wartime Parisian art market. However, works such as the Gleizes, were indeed seized from Jews deported to death camps or fleeing persecution, or sold under duress at rock-bottom prices.|$|E
40|$|While {{significant}} {{national attention}} {{has recently been}} paid to varying questions about the <b>legal</b> <b>duties</b> of prospective mothers to their unborn children, little comparable focus {{has been placed on}} the duties of prospective fathers. Why the difference? Though men and women obviously participate differently in nurturing the development of potential human life, there is much that both prospective parents can do to promote the well-being of their future offspring. This inattention to male responsibilities not only undercuts prevailing governmental interests in protecting potential life, but also may, at times, constitute prohibited sex discrimination. When {{attention has been paid to}} prospective fathers, the results are usually disheartening. Treatment of men is often too lenient; yet, on occasion, treatment is too harsh. Further, many times there is little correlation between the <b>legal</b> <b>duties</b> of prospective mothers and fathers in situations where their conduct is comparable. This article seeks to prompt greater dialogue on the <b>legal</b> <b>duties</b> of prospective fathers to their unborn children. In doing so, it employs a recent case litigated in the courts of Florida and involving certain aspects of a prospective father's <b>legal</b> <b>duties.</b> The article utilizes the case, as well as recent controversies over prebirth maternal duties, to suggest some guidelines for establishing prebirth paternal duties. In particular, it addresses paternal duties in settings involving criminal prosecution, coercive civil laws, and involuntary termination of parental rights-areas which to date have been significantly considered only for prospective mothers. Finally, it examines additional prebirth paternal duties in settings where there are no easy parallels to maternal conduct...|$|R

500|$|A {{second major}} change {{was in the}} {{approach}} accountants took to their job. Previously the attitude was that accountants were only required to do their <b>legal</b> <b>duty,</b> but after the Royal Mail Case accountants were more and more expected to use their ethical and moral judgement in making decisions. Contemporaries said that the case [...] "probably had {{a greater impact on}} the quality of published data than all the Companies Acts passed up to that date".

In 1988 12-year-old Ashley King died in Phoenix, Arizona, after living for months with a tumor on her leg that had a [...] circumference; her parents pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment.

500|$|It {{requires}} that the defendant owed a duty of care to the victim (it is for the judge to decide on which facts such a duty would be created). These rules are typically those of tort. For example, in R v Pittwood, the defendant was put under a duty to act on account of being contractually obliged to close the gates at a railway crossing. Similar duties include those of a doctor of his patients, an electrician over a householder he has done work for, parents over their children, and, developed more recently, a police officer over persons he arrests. Included, however, are those of a criminal enterprise, which would not attract tortious liability in the civil law. Where the defendant is liable through an omission and not an act, then a <b>legal</b> <b>duty</b> to act – rather than a duty of care – is needed. Andrew Ashworth has criticised {{the nature of the}} duty of care requirement as [...] "decision-making at its retrospective worst".|$|E
