50|$|The {{earliest}} psychiatric facility {{began as}} a 30-bed building {{at the corner of}} Bras Basah Road and Bencoolen Street in 1841. It was then known as ‘The Insane Hospital.’ It was renamed the ‘Lunatic Asylum’ in 1861, and moved to a site near the old Kandang Kerbau Maternity Hospital. In 1887, this hospital was moved to the ‘New Lunatic Asylum’, with a capacity for 300 patients, built at College Road (Sepoy <b>Lines)</b> to <b>check</b> <b>an</b> outbreak of cholera. In 1928, a 24-ward ‘The Mental Hospital’ was built along Yio Chu Kang Road. The ‘New Lunatic Asylum’ at Sepoy Lines and the ward at Pasir Panjang were closed down and 1030 patients were transferred to ‘The Mental Hospital’.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuel system}} of a hit-and-miss engine {{consists}} of a fuel tank, fuel <b>line,</b> <b>check</b> valve and fuel mixer. The fuel tank most typically holds gasoline but many users would start the engines with gasoline and then switch over to a cheaper fuel such as kerosene or diesel [...] The fuel line connects the fuel tank to the mixer. Along the fuel <b>line,</b> <b>a</b> <b>check</b> valve keeps the fuel from running back to the tank between combustion strokes. The mixer creates the correct fuel-air mixture {{by means of a}} needle valve attached to a weighted or spring-loaded piston usually in conjunction with an oil-damped dashpot.|$|R

During his twenty-five-year tenure with Delta, he progressed through several positions and aircraft and retired as <b>a</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Check</b> Captain with <b>an</b> assignment to the Boeing 767-400 aircraft. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Check</b> Captain, Thompson {{was responsible for}} both training and evaluating other Delta Captains and co-pilots. In addition to his flying duties, Captain Thompson was {{an active participant in}} the Flight Operations Department, representing Delta at numerous conferences, expos and civic engagements. Additionally, he was active with the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) serving as Chairman of the Legislative Affairs Committee. [...] As one of the aviation industry’s few African-American commercial airline pilots, Captain Thompson was very active in the minority community. He has been a speaker at numerous inner city schools, helped establish a national scholarship program for minority students interested in aviation and served as Committee Chairman for the Joint National Convention of the Organization of Black Airline Pilots (OBAP) and the Tuskegee Airmen. Captain Thompson has received numerous indices of recognition from Delta Air Lines, ALPA and OBAP for his contributions.|$|R

It was first investigated whether the scheme will be sufficient, and if some correctors or monitors could be suppressed {{in order to reduce}} the cost. The correction scheme was in particular tested for the case of faulty correctors or monitors. Possible critical scenarios were identified, which may not be visible in a purely statistical analysis. This part of the analysis was largely based on the experience with trajectory and orbit correction problems encountered in the SPS and LEP. The simulation of the trajectory correction procedure was done using recently developed software...|$|R

While {{he cracked}} the Canucks' NHL roster out of training camp for the first time, he was used predominantly on the team's fourth <b>line</b> in <b>a</b> <b>checking</b> role {{for which he was}} ill-suited. After recording only 3 points in 31 games and being returned to the AHL, Bohonos was dealt to the Toronto Maple Leafs for Brandon Convery in an exchange of struggling talents.

40|$|Modern {{airline pilots}} are tasked every flight with the safe and {{efficient}} operation of highly automated airliners in today’s complicated global and economic environments. Airlines have developed {{standard operating procedures}} (SOP) for normal, abnormal, and emergency operations. These procedures serve as a script for crews to follow. These procedures are designed by airlines to ensure that aircraft are operated in the (1) most safe, (2) most efficient, and (3) most on-time manner. For the most part pilots will comply with SOP, but when they (1) don 9 t agree with SOP, (2) don 9 t understand SOP or {{the risks associated with}} not complying with SOP, or (3) don 9 t feel adequately trained to know what SOP is, it is difficult to motivate them to comply. Airlines have the means to measure compliance through Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) and Line Operations Safety Audit (LOSA). The purpose of this research is to determine if increased understanding, knowledge and awareness of the risk of noncompliance with SOP increase airline pilots’ compliance with SOP. This research explores data from <b>line</b> <b>checks</b> at <b>a</b> major US airline that was gathered in pursuit of understanding what drives SOP compliance. Baseline data was gathered and analyzed to determine the top 12 noncompliant items. The airline provided training during the Human Factors module in each pilots recurrent training on Pilot Intentional Non Compliance (PINC). The training including developing pilots’ understanding that while most Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) reports grant pilots immunity from legal action, if a violation is labeled PINC, ASAP protections do not apply. Further <b>line</b> <b>checks</b> were conducted after the pilots received the PINC training. The top 12 noncompliant items from the pre-PINC training group were compared to the same 12 items in the post-PINC training group. Significant improvement in SOP compliance was found in six of the 12 items tested. The results established that training pilots on the risk of PINC did significantly increase SOP compliance...|$|R

The 23rd and 40th, whose boats were the first to land, rushed up the height without {{stopping}} to fire a shot, and, charging the two French battalions with the bayonet, carried it and two hills in the rear, taking three pieces of cannon posted there. The 42nd Regiment formed up as if on parade, and mounted the sand-hills under the fire of two pieces of artillery and a battalion of infantry. The moment they reached the crest 200 French cavalry advanced to charge, but fell back under the heavy fire opened upon them.|$|R
2500|$|Though {{he was set}} {{to become}} an {{unrestricted}} free agent following the season, Stajan opted to remain in Calgary and signed a four-year, $14 million contract with the Flames. Stajan's offensive production rapidly declined over the following two seasons – he scored 31 points in 2010–11 and only 18 in 2011–12 – which resulted increasing condemnation of his play and arguments that his contract {{had become one of}} the [...] "worst in franchise history" [...] while head coach Brent Sutter dropped him from the top scoring lines to the fourth <b>line</b> in <b>a</b> <b>checking</b> role.

Not a big player, standing six feet tall weighing 180 pounds, he played a gritty, physical, brand of hockey primary in <b>a</b> <b>checking</b> <b>line</b> role. <b>As</b> a checker it was his responsibility {{to shut down the}} opposition and keep them from scoring, emphasizing defense over offense. Because of his versatility and role, he was often a member of his team's penalty killing unit. Breslin was known for his team-first attitude and willingness to do whatever was asked of him in order to help the team succeed. Former Wolves General Manager Kevin Cheveldayoff said of Breslin, [...] "You could always count on Tim to come and compete every night and do what was needed for the team to win". Not the most talented of players, Breslin's work ethic helped him to be a better player. Head coach Anderson once stated, [...] "He is the kind of player who maybe isn't in the very upper echelon in skill factor, but his dedication and hard work make up for that." ...|$|R
