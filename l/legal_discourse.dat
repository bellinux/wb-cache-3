40|$|In {{the last}} decades of {{international}} legal thought, the defining role of bindingness has been growingly approached with skepticism. It is less and less construed as the exclusive genetic code that provides the instructions for the identification and autonomous development of international <b>legal</b> <b>discourses</b> as international lawyers have sought to emancipate themselves from their own genetic heritage. Since {{the second half of}} the 20 th century, many international lawyers have come to feel that international <b>legal</b> <b>discourses</b> ought no longer to be structured and developed around the dichotomy between the ‘legally binding’ and the ‘legally non-binding’. Their emancipatory moves have arguably brought about refreshing dynamism and excitement in international legal thought. And yet, as this article argues, bindingness has proved resilient. After recalling the modern understandings and ontological functions of bindingness in international <b>legal</b> <b>discourses</b> (1), a few observations are formulated on the emancipatory experiments found in recent international legal thought (2). This paper ends with some remarks on the resilience of the idea of bindingness as a result of the anxiety and suspicions that have accompanied the attempts to alter the genetic code of the discipline (3) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the similarities and}} differences of the <b>legal</b> <b>discourses</b> on the prohibition of retroactive laws within the European human rights framework, and more broadly, a temporal framework that accompanies questions of historical injustice. The paper considers the significance of the notion of retrospective justice in post- 1989 Europe, and more specifically in Germany and Poland. From a criminal law perspective the idea of punishing people for an act that was not a crime at the time of commission is regarded as reprehensible. However, a different temporal narrative was evoked with the fall of Communism in 1989 that was based on responses to atrocities committed during the Second World War. The paper outlines the legal context that frames retrospective justice, nationally and regionally, and considers the importance of permitting the law to work retroactively. By examining certain aspects of the German and Polish experiences, the paper concurs that retrospective justice in post-Communist Europe contributes a specific set of problems to the field of transitional justice, none of which sit comfortably with one solution, and all of which demonstrate that narratives on select chapters of Communist histories remain unfinished. The narratives also show that transitional criminal justice has taken on a permanent character in <b>legal</b> <b>discourses,</b> in which retrospective justice takes on a dynamic meaning...|$|R

Research completed at the Department of AnthropologyThe US Evangelical movement's use of media and the court system since the 1980 s to litigate morality issues, such as abortion, has gained global attention {{with the state of}} Kansas {{at the center of this}} awareness. On May 31, 2009, Scott Roeder, an anti-abortion activist, walked into the Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, KS and killed abortion provider, Dr. George Tiller, where he was attending Sunday morning services. I explore Roeder‘s killing of Tiller, as a public crisis, and the news reporting of the subsequent trial from an anthropological perspective. This research was carried out with members of the Wichita community who were bound by their reading of news sources which reported on the trial of Scott Roeder. I posit the public performance of violence and the ritual process of the trial were communicative and catalysts for change within some Christian communities in Wichita. I argue the <b>legal</b> <b>discourses</b> produced as a result of the conflict and resolutions have brought out moderate Evangelical identities and communities, historically associated with conservative Evangelicalism and strictly anti-abortion positions.

40|$|In {{the early}} 2000 s {{migration}} towards Italy, {{both as a}} destination and transit country, was on the rise and gained increasing importance on the political agenda. In this context, enhanced security measures of border control in the Mediterranean became a priority. Meanwhile, new forms of postcolonial resistance have emerged as Italy has been compelled to face its long-standing colonial amnesia. The 2012 documentary film Mare Chiuso (Closed Sea) captures {{a slice of the}} entangled discourses, politics and practices in the Mediterranean. It recounts the story of boat migrants who set off from Libya in May 2009 and were forced back to their point of departure by Italian authorities. Engaging with the testimonies of the migrants involved, {{as well as with the}} <b>legal</b> <b>discourses</b> surrounding the case, Mare Chiuso brings to the fore the emerging contradictions at play in dominant discursive practices. The film offers alternative perspectives from the margins, problematizes official narratives and instigates fruitful debates on the Mediterranean as a geopolitical and cultural site. Traversing postcolonial and cultural studies, political science and law, this essay proposes an analysis of Mare Chiuso as an instance of postcolonial resistance. Independent and separate disciplinary approaches have failed successfully to map and investigate complex phenomena such as migration; thus, this essay brings into contact cultural theory and <b>legal</b> <b>discourses</b> with the aim of better understanding the burgeoning postcolonial phenomena in contemporary Italy...|$|R
