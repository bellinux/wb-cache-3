In order to obtain a correlation of the diversion cross-flow, we conducted adiabatic air-water experiments using a vertical multiple-channel with two subchannels simplifying the triangle tight <b>lattice</b> <b>rod</b> bundle. In the experiments, data were obtained on the axial variations in the pressure difference between the subchannels, the ratio of flow rate in one subchannel to the whole channel, and the void fraction in each subchannel for two-phase flow case.

50|$|Streaked or {{elongated}} {{spots are}} common to RHEED patterns. As Fig 3 shows, the reciprocal <b>lattice</b> <b>rods</b> with the lowest orders intersect the Ewald sphere at very small angles, so the intersection between the rods and sphere is not a singular point if the sphere and rods have thickness. The incident electron beam diverges and electrons in the beam {{have a range of}} energies, so in practice, the Ewald sphere is not infinitely thin as it is theoretically modeled. The reciprocal <b>lattice</b> <b>rods</b> have a finite thickness as well, with their diameters dependent {{on the quality of the}} sample surface. Streaks appear in the place of perfect points when broadened rods intersect the Ewald sphere. Diffraction conditions are fulfilled over the entire intersection of the rods with the sphere, yielding elongated points or ‘streaks’ along the vertical axis of the RHEED pattern. In real cases, streaky RHEED patterns indicate a flat sample surface while the broadening of the streaks indicate small area of coherence on the surface.|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of algebraic topology the closed sequence of 4 -dimensional polyhedra (algebraic polytopes) was defined. This sequence is started by the polytope 240, discovered by Coxeter, and {{is determined by the}} second coordination sphere of 8 -dimensional lattice E 8. The second polytope of sequence allows to determine a topologically stable rod substructure that appears during multiplication by a non-crystallographic axis 40 / 11 of the starting union of 4 tetrahedra with common vertex. When positioning the appropriate atoms tin positions of special symmetry of the staring 4 tetrahedra, such helicoid determines an α-helix. The third polytope of sequence allows to determine the helicoidally-like union of rods with 12 -fold axis, which can be compare with Z-DNA structures. This model is defined as a local <b>lattice</b> <b>rod</b> packing, contained within a surface of helicoidally similar type, which ensures its topological stability, as well as possibility for it to be transformed into other forms of DNA structures. Formation of such structures corresponds to lifting a configuration degeneracy, and the stability of a state - to existence of a point of bifurcation. Furthermore, in the case of DNA structures, a second "security check" possibly takes place in the form of local lattice (periodic) property using the lattices other than the main ones.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. An experimental study using 6 x 6 and 2 x 2 square <b>lattice</b> <b>rod</b> bundles has been performed to investigate the effects of spacer grids on the heat transfer enhancement during a bottom-reflood phase. The spacer grids improve a turbulent mixing of flow and induces breakup of large droplets into smaller ones. These result in the heat transfer enhancement between the fuel rods and the surrounding fluid. Since the geometry of the spacer grid affects the turbulent mixing and droplet breakup behaviors, three types of spacer grids with different geometry were tested in the present study. In order to investigate the heat transfer enhancement by spacer grids, single-phase steam cooling and droplet breakup by spacer grid were separately investigated. For the convective heat transfer enhancement in singlephase steam flow, the heater rod surface temperatures were measured {{in the vicinity of}} the space grid. In single-phase steam cooling experiment, the heat transfer was enhanced at upstream and downstream of spacer grids. Downstream of the spacer, the heat transfer enhancement decays with the distance from the top end of the spacer grid exponentially. The heat transfer enhancement depends on the Reynolds number as well as the flow blockage ratio. A new empirical correlation was developed in order to account for the effect of the Reynolds number. For the droplet breakup experiment, the sizes and velocities of droplets were measured across the spacer grid. The droplet breakup ratio decreases with increasing the Weber number of the droplet impacting on the spacer grid. The droplet breakup ratio by spacer grids was relatively higher than conventional correlations. dc 201...|$|E
