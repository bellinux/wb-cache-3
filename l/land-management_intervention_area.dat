40|$|Thesis (MMed.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2007. Introduction: Inadequate {{water supply}} and {{sanitation}} adversely affects the health and socio-economic development of communities. Since 2003, more than 40 000 households in peri-urban and rural areas within eThekwini Municipality, South Africa, have been provided with urine diversion toilets, safe water and hygiene education. eThekwini Municipality have requested that these interventions be evaluated to monitor their effect on health outcomes. Aim: The aim of the study is to describe the baseline situation in respect of sanitation, safe water and hygiene behaviour in <b>Intervention</b> <b>Areas</b> in eThekwini Municipality and compare these to Control Areas. Methods: An observational analytic cross sectional study design was undertaken. A multi-stage sampling procedure was followed and six study areas were randomly selected. Three <b>Intervention</b> <b>Areas</b> (urine diversion toilets) were matched with three Control Areas (no urine diversion toilets). A total of 1337 households, comprising of 7219 individuals, were included in the study. A Household Questionnaire a and an Observational Protocolb was administered by fieldworkers. Data was entered onto a custom designed EpiData database, processed and analysed using SPSS version 13. Results: The baseline characteristics revealed that <b>Intervention</b> and Control <b>areas</b> were very similar other than the provision of urine diversion toilets, safe water and hygiene education in the <b>Intervention</b> <b>area.</b> The <b>Intervention</b> <b>area</b> scored higher than the Control area (2. 31 vs. 1. 64) with regard to having a cleaner toilet, with no flies, no smells, having hand-washing facilities and soap provided close to the toilet. Some of the collected data from questionnaire responses were not consistent with the fieldworkers observations. It was reported that 642 households in the Control and 621 in the <b>Intervention</b> <b>areas</b> washed their hands with soap, whilst only 396 households in the Control and 309 in the <b>Intervention</b> <b>areas</b> were observed to have washed their hands with soap. Conclusion: Households in the Control area are at a greater risk of developing diarrhoeal and other related diseases. The provision of safe water, urine diversion toilets and hygiene education in the <b>Intervention</b> <b>area</b> has proved to be successful. Recommendations: eThekwini municipality must expand the package of services c to the Control areas. Sustainable hygiene education programmes must continue to be implemented and be evaluated over time.

40|$|Objective: The {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the effect of health and nutrition training among health workers on anaemia in rural communities of Tanzania. Methods: The study utilised two sets of data. Data on haemoglobin levels (secondary data) for under five children and pregnant women attending maternal and child health clinics at the sentinel district hospital was obtained from Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre (TFNC). Data was collected in the months of May and November from November 1997 to November 1998. At the sentinel laboratory a cyanomethaemoglobin method was used to determine haemoglobin concentration. Haemoglobin levels of less than 11 gm/dl was used to define anaemia for the two population groups. Primary data on knowledge, attitudes and practices among health workers and community members on anaemia were obtained through a cross-sectional study in the <b>intervention</b> and control <b>areas</b> in October 2000. The study areas were among the sentinel districts for anaemia surveillance. The <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> was randomly selected among those districts where health and nutrition training was provided to the health workers. The control area was selected from the areas where no health and nutrition training was instituted to the health workers. Control area had similar socioeconomic and geographical characteristics with the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> Results: Anaemia was highly prevalent in the two study population in both <b>areas,</b> the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> having significantly higher prevalence (82 %) than the control area (76 %) in under five children (p = 0. 028). A similar trend was observed in pregnant women, 75 percent being anaemic in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> as opposed to 72 percent in the control area but {{the difference between the two}} areas was not significant. For both groups prevalence of anaemia was observed to be high in May than in November (p < 0. 001). Regarding knowledge, health workers and respondents at household level in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> had higher knowledge than in the control area. However, the percentage of respondents with good knowledge was very low. Although there was some improved practices in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area,</b> it did not reflect the knowledge improvement as compared to the control area. Dietary practices favorable to prevent anaemia were found to be more in the control area than in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> Staples were the food group regularly consumed by the majority in both areas at household level than any other food groups. Conclusion: Findings of this study indicate that the observed high prevalence of anaemia in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> may partly be explained by lack of good knowledge on anaemia among the majority of health workers. Further, this may have lead to poor practices for the prevention and control of anaemia at community level. Therefore, there is a need for reviewing the health and nutrition training programme so that its future implementation can bring desirable change through improved knowledge among the health workers, involvement of policy makers and active cooperation of the community members.

A quasi-experimental design was used, with pre- and post-implementation registrations in the program implementation area (population 41, 000) and in a neighbouring control municipality (population 26, 000) in Östergötland County, Sweden. The traffic injury rate in the not vocationally active households was twice than employed or self-employed households in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> In the employed and not vocationally active households, males showed higher injury rates than females in both areas. In the self-employed households females exhibited higher injury rates than males in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> Males from not vocationally active households displayed the highest post-intervention injury rate in both the <b>intervention</b> and control <b>areas.</b> After 6 years of Safe Community program activity, the injury rates for males in employed category, injury rates for females in self-employed category, and males/females in non- vocationally active category displayed a decreasing trend in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> However, in the control area injury rate decreased only for males of employed households. The study indicated that there was almost no change in injury rates in the control area. Reduction of traffic injuries in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> between 1983 and 1989 was likely to be attributable to the success of safety promotion program.

Hence, the most critical issue the country is confronted with at present is the reconstruction of the historical buildings and places of the cities. The {{purpose of this study is}} to review the reconstruction project of Mashhad city center, Iran’s second largest metropolis, as an instance of urban redevelopment projects carried out in Iran since 1979. The present study was conducted in the city center of Mashhad by dividing it into two distinct parts: direct <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> (under supervi-sion of governmental authorities) and indirect <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> (under supervision of the private sector and sub-governmental authorities). The results obtained from questionnaires show that in the direct <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> residents are faced with a great deal of problems (forced relocation, unemployment, low incomes, cul-tural–social alienation, eviction and so forth).

40|$|Background: Schistosoma mansoni {{infection}} is a persistent {{public health problem}} in many Kenyan communities. Although praziquantel is available, re-infection after chemotherapy treatment is inevitable, especially among children. Chemotherapy followed by intermittent mollusciciding of habitats of Biomphalaria pfeifferi, the intermediate host snail, may have longer term benefits, especially if timed to coincide with natural fluctuations in snail populations. Methods: In this cohort study, the Kambu River (<b>Intervention</b> <b>area)</b> was molluscicided intermittently for 4 years, after mass chemotherapy with praziquantel in the adjacent community of Darajani in January 1997. The nearby Thange River was selected as a control (Non-intervention area), and its adjacent community of Ulilinzi was treated with praziquantel in December 1996. Snail numbers were recorded monthly at 9 – 10 sites along each river, while rainfall data were collected monthly, and annual parasitological surveys were undertaken in each village. The mollusciciding protocol was adapted to local conditions, and simplified to improve prospects for widespread application. Results: After the initial reduction in prevalence attributable to chemotherapy, there was a gradual increase in the prevalence and intensity of infection in the non-intervention area, and significantly lower levels of re-infection amongst inhabitants of the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> Incidence ratio between areas adjusted for age and gender at the first follow-up survey, 5 weeks after treatment in the non-intervention area and 4 months after treatment in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> was not significant (few people turned positive), while during the following 4 annual surveys these ratios were 0. 58 (0. 39 - 0. 85), 0. 33 (0. 18 - 0. 60), 0. 14 (0. 09 - 0. 21) and 0. 45 (0. 26 - 0. 75), respectively. Snail numbers were consistently low in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> {{as a result of}} the mollusciciding. Following termination of the mollusciciding at the end of 2000, snail populations and infections in snails increased again in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that in the Kenyan setting a combination of chemotherapy followed by intermittent mollusciciding can have longer term benefits than chemotherapy alone...|$|R

A comparison was made of primary care consultation and pathology data of people with SMI from <b>intervention</b> and control <b>areas.</b> Negative binomial regression models were used to compare the frequency and length of GP consultations, as well as the number and type of pathology examinations. Results. Records of 103 people from <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> and 98 controls were obtained. <b>Intervention</b> and control <b>areas</b> were not different at baseline in terms of age and claims data, but females had higher consultation rates. After adjusting for gender, people from <b>intervention</b> <b>areas</b> had more GP consultations, especially long consultations (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1. 56; 95 % confidence interval 1. 28 – 1. 91).

The study used a prospective quasi-experimental design which compared changes in diet and psychological health {{in an area}} where a new hypermarket was built (the <b>intervention</b> <b>area)</b> with a similarly deprived comparison area in Glasgow (Shettleston). A postal survey was undertaken both before and one year after the hypermarket was built, to assess changes in diet, self-reported health, and perceptions of neighbourhood. Changes in the retail structure of both areas were assessed through a ‘before-and-(repeated) -after’ intervention shop count survey. Qualitative data on diet, the neighbourhood, and the impact of the store were collected through focus groups. The quantitative study found limited improvements in diet and health. There was weak evidence for the impact of the hypermarket on population diet. There was weak evidence that poor psychological health in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> reduced. Amongst those who ‘switched’ to the new hypermarket there was weak evidence of a small improvement in mean fruit and vegetable consumption but good evidence of psychological health improvement. Qualitative and retail survey results reinforce this, identifying perceptions of areal improvement through redevelopment and a small positive impact of the new store on the retail structure of the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Restoration {{interventions}} to combat land degradation {{are carried out}} in arid and semi-arid areas to improve vegetation cover and land productivity. Evaluating the success of an intervention over time is challenging due to various constraints (e. g. difficult-to-access areas, lack of long-term records) {{and the lack of}} standardised and affordable methodologies. We propose a semi-automatic methodology that uses remote sensing data to provide a rapid, standardised and objective assessment of the biophysical impact, in terms of vegetation cover, of restoration interventions. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used as a proxy for vegetation cover. Recognising that changes in vegetation cover are naturally due to environmental factors such as seasonality and inter-annual climate variability, conclusions about the success of the intervention cannot be drawn by focussing on the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> only. We therefore use a comparative method that analyses the temporal variations (before and after the intervention) of the NDVI of the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> with respect to multiple control sites that are automatically and randomly selected from a set of candidates that are similar to the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> Similarity is defined in terms of class composition as derived from an ISODATA classification of the imagery before the intervention. The method provides an estimate of the magnitude and significance of the difference in greenness change between the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> and control areas. As a case study, the methodology is applied to 15 restoration interventions carried out in Senegal. The impact of the interventions is analysed using 250 -m MODIS and 30 -m Landsat data. Results show that a significant improvement in vegetation cover was detectable only in one third of the analysed interventions, which is consistent with independent qualitative assessments based on field observations and visual analysis of high resolution imagery. Rural development agencies may potentially use the proposed method for a first screening of restoration interventions. European Unio...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: First, to {{evaluate}} whether a local campaign to prevent childhood injuries increased parents' inclination to follow eight television programmes broadcast nationwide, and second, to assess whether parents reached by a local campaign benefitted more from the television programmes than those not reached by the campaign. METHODS: Before the television programmes were broadcast, all families with preschool children living in a typical Swedish municipality (the <b>intervention</b> <b>area)</b> {{received a letter from}} the head of the child health services encouraging them to watch the programmes. The local campaign also included face-to-face information and advice on childhood injuries at all day care centres and child health centres in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> After all the programmes had been broadcast, telephone interviews were conducted with one parent from 77 % of all 1699 households with at least one preschool child in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area,</b> and with 87 % of a random sample of 144 parents from other, similar municipalities. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The local campaign increased parents' inclination to follow the programmes. No significant association was found, however, between the number of programmes followed and measures undertaken in the homes as a direct consequence of the programmes. Nor was a significant association found between the number of programmes viewed and parents' attitudes towards risks. A local campaign may increase parents' awareness of information provided by the mass media on childhood injuries...|$|R
40|$|Between 1987 and 1989 the Cancer Research Campaign funded {{a health}} {{education}} programme for the early detection of cutaneous malignant melanoma {{in the general population}} in 6 health districts of England and 1 health board in Scotland (population of 3 million). The intervention was evaluated by studying its effects on annual and cumulative mortality rates for melanoma. Population-based data on mortality from melanoma were collected in the <b>intervention</b> <b>areas,</b> the health regions covering those areas, and 5 other health regions of England from 1981 to 1996. Deaths from melanoma in cases diagnosed after the start of the intervention were used to study cumulative mortality rates. The annual mortality rates for melanoma, 1981 to 1996, showed no significant difference in their trends between the <b>intervention</b> <b>areas,</b> and other areas of England and Wales. After adjustment for pre-intervention rates, there was also no significant reduction in cumulative mortality from melanoma in the <b>intervention</b> <b>areas</b> compared with the non-intervention areas: rate ratio 1. 2 (95 % Cl 0. 9 – 1. 7) in men, 0. 9 (95 % Cl 0. 7 – 1. 3) in females. The lack of a significant reduction in melanoma mortality associated with the intervention raises questions about this approach to early detection and emphasises the need for new strategies. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign[URL]...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{provides}} an overview of French national urban policy for the period 1981 – 2002, organized around three themes: spatial conceptualizations of <b>intervention</b> <b>areas</b> and changing scales of intervention, discursive articulations of <b>intervention</b> <b>areas,</b> and legitimation of state intervention. By relating the transformations of this policy to the contemporary restructuring of the French state, the paper argues that although there are elements of convergence, the contemporary restructuring of the French state differs remarkably from a US or UK-style neoliberalization, partly because of the republican tradition emphasizing the active role of the state for the well-being of its citizens. This restructuring carries the signs of the strong state tradition in France, and is best understood as an articulation of neoliberalism with established political traditions, an articulation that I try to capture with the notion of a ''republican penal state''...|$|R
