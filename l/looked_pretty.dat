500|$|Originally, {{the game}} was {{referred}} to as [...] "F-Zero on water" [...] and would feature high-speed boats, as shown in footage from the 1995 Nintendo Shoshinkai show. These boats were expected to have transforming capabilities, allowing players to switch from a stable catamaran-style form to a more streamlined canoe-style version. However, the boats were ultimately replaced with Jet Skis. According to Miyamoto, [...] "Boats <b>looked</b> <b>pretty</b> good at the show, but I didn't think that Wave Race 64 would be unique from similar games on other systems if we used boats. Jet Skis can show many maneuvers that work well in the realistic water of Wave Race 64." [...] The use of Jet Skis was suggested by Rare's Tim Stamper. The game uses the Nintendo 64's alpha blending feature to make the water simultaneously transparent and reflective.|$|E
500|$|The {{two songs}} {{performed}} by Will Schuester {{received the most}} negative reviews. Chaney described [...] "La Cucaracha" [...] as [...] "mercifully brief", and Slezak gave it an [...] "F" [...] for being not only [...] "intentionally awful" [...] but [...] "awful-awful". Chaney was more generously inclined toward [...] "A Little Less Conversation". She wrote, [...] "Matthew Morrison managed to give his all to this Spanish-infused Elvis Presley cover, even though he <b>looked</b> <b>pretty</b> ridiculous in that matador outfit", {{and gave it a}} [...] "B". Futterman stated that the performance reached [...] "a new low" [...] with the appearance of [...] "Mike and Brittany as his bulls", and Lynch said that the number [...] "was supposed to suck" [...] and [...] "did its job well"; even so, he gave it a [...] Slezak gave a one-word summation to accompany his [...] "D" [...] grade: [...] "No." ...|$|E
500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a 'B-', stating [...] "I've defended this show against {{complaints}} that it’s terminally bland, but formulaic material like this really does expose its flaws. It’s definitely not an unwatchably bad show ... In short: don’t be shy, Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. Show {{us what you}} can do." [...] He did praise the visual effects in the episode though, saying, [...] "This week’s episode {{had a couple of}} very nicely-staged set pieces and, especially for broadcast TV, some excellent special effects. Fire is hard to pull off, even in a blockbuster movie, but this episode revolved around a character ... who can generate and manipulate fire, and everything he did <b>looked</b> <b>pretty</b> cool." [...] Morgan Jeffrey at Digital Spy scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, calling it a [...] "slow burn", and concluding that [...] "Skye's arc is easily the weakest aspect of [...] "Girl in the Flower Dress" [...] but there's a decent villain and a strong climax to help compensate." [...] Will Salmon of SFX also scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, stating [...] "a shade more mature than the initial installments. It’s a welcome growth, and it does feel like Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. is getting itself together. They found the right levels of warmth and humanity last week, and humour and drama this time around. Now they just need to start going on some genuinely compelling missions against decent enemies." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt the series [...] "has settled into a pragmatic, if sometimes predictable comfort zone", and said that the episode [...] "delivered enough premise, pace, and patter to get its audience through a mellow hour — and set the bar higher {{for the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E

500|$|Although vastly {{critically}} acclaimed, {{the song}} did receive some minor criticism. Lukewarmly, Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic commented, [...] "numbers like 'Be Our Guest' provides evidence that Lumiere and co. are infinitely preferable as entertaining flatware." [...] On Lansbury's performance, Tan joked, [...] "The singer's delightfully personable contribution is almost {{reason enough to}} forgive Disney for thinking her English accent... would not look {{out of place in}} a film set in 18th century France." [...] A more negative review was written by Pete Vonder Haar of The Houston Press. Observing that Beauty and the Beast [...] "was Disney's first stab at incorporating computer animation," [...] he felt that [...] "the results are, now, pretty primitive," [...] concluding, [...] "I recall thinking the dancing forks during 'Be Our Guest'... <b>looked</b> <b>pretty</b> bad and time has not been kind." [...] The song has also been compared to [...] "Under the Sea" [...] from The Little Mermaid, most of which have been mixed. Jay Boyar the Orlando Sentinel opined, [...] "'Be Our Guest'... is the closest thing in Beauty and the Beast to the bubbly 'Under the Sea' extravaganza in The Little Mermaid," [...] while Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman's review was much more negative, describing the song as [...] "merely serviceable" [...] and concluding, 'Be Our Guest,'... sorry to say, is no 'Under the Sea'." [...] Likewise, Desson Howe of The Washington Post panned both the song and Lumiere, writing, [...] "the Candelabrum's Maurice Chevalier accent is clearly intended to substitute for the Caribbean-lilted lobster in Mermaid. And the ensemble song, 'Be Our Guest,' in which the household gadgets enjoin Belle to live with them, is an obvious attempt to reprise a similar Mermaid number, 'Under the Sea.' But it's just under par." ...|$|E

2500|$|For 1974, the Chevrolet Nova got larger {{parking lights}} and new bow-tie grille emblems, {{as well as}} {{modified}} bumpers that added two inches to length and helped cushion minor impacts. The Powerglide {{was replaced by a}} lightweight version of the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic 350 ( [...] THM 250 [...] ) already offered with the [...] V8, which was the only V8 offered for 1974. Nova sales continued the surge they had enjoyed since 1972 and approached 400,000 cars for 1974. Six-cylinder Novas were the fastest gainers, as sales of V-8 Novas declined. These were the years of the first energy crisis as Middle Eastern countries cut back on oil exports. After waiting for hours in gas lines and fretting about the prospect of fuel rationing, thrifty compacts <b>looked</b> <b>pretty</b> good to plenty of Americans. Nova fit the bill.|$|E

2500|$|On 25 February, Winx {{returned}} in the Chipping Norton Stakes. Originally at odds of 1.10, she drifted out slightly to 1.22 {{because of the}} heavy going. With the rain still falling shortly before the race, Waller walked the course and determined it was safe for Winx to run. [...] "I {{was so close to}} scratching her but we made the right decision. I walked the track before the race and it <b>looked</b> <b>pretty</b> good to me. It was safe and that was my main concern," [...] he said. Although her time was slow, Winx won with ease by two lengths over longshot Lasqueti Spirit. Hartnell did not handle the track and was well back in eighth. [...] "Today the conditions were fair and even," [...] said Bowman, [...] "yeah sure it is wet but everyone is getting their chance and it is just a case of whether your horse can cope with the surface or not. Clearly this mare can." ...|$|E
