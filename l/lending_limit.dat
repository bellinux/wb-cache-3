50|$|Lending-limit {{regulations}} {{restrict the}} total amount of loans and credits that a bank may extend to a single borrower. This restriction is usually stated {{as a percentage of the}} bank's capital or assets. For example, a national bank generally must limit its total outstanding loans and credits to any single borrower to no more than 15% of the bank's total capital and surplus. Some state banking regulations also contain similar lending limits applicable to state-chartered banks. Both federal and state laws generally allow for a higher <b>lending</b> <b>limit</b> (up to 25% of capital and surplus for national banks) when the portion of the credit that exceeds the initial <b>lending</b> <b>limit</b> is fully secured.|$|E

Arnholt Smith, grew during the 1960s {{to become the}} 86th largest bank {{in the country with}} $1.2 billion in total assets. It failed in 1973 in the largest bank failure to date. The cause was bad loans to Smith-controlled companies, which exceeded the bank's legal <b>lending</b> <b>limit.</b> Smith had used the bank's money for his private business and bribed bank inspectors to cover it up.

The bank grew to become the 86th largest bank in the country with $1.2 billion in total assets. The bank failed in October 1973, at which time it was the largest bank failure in history, due to an excessive level of bad loans to Smith-controlled companies, which exceeded the bank's legal <b>lending</b> <b>limit.</b> [...] In August 1973, the Internal Revenue Service sued Smith for $23 million for back taxes. The IRS filed criminal charges in the case but they were later dropped. [...] In 1975, Smith pleaded no contest to bank fraud charges and was placed on probation and fined $30,000. [...] That same year, Smith was sued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for $45 million for engaging in “unsafe and unsound” banking practices. [...] In 1977, a judge ordered Smith jailed for contempt because he refused to answer questions regarding his personal finances. [...] In 1979, Smith was convicted of embezzlement of $8.9 million and tax fraud, involving his sale of the San Diego Padres. He served eight months in a county minimum-security Work Furlough Center in 1984 and 1985; his sentence was reduced due to his poor health. [...] He died in 1996 of congestive heart failure.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{voices in}} the administration, however, {{continued}} to point in the opposite direction: for example Under Secretary of State Herbert Hoover Jr. and the new ICA head, John Hollister, who represented more frugal attitudes. Given the lack of consensus, Pres. Eisenhower and Congress conducted in 1956 {{a number of studies}} to give foreign aid policy a more solid basis. Mainly delivered in early 1957, the reports included an updated version of the essay by Millikan & Rostow that C.D. Jackson had circulated in 1954. The overall view that emerged was that sustained development assistance would have long-term benefits for the U.S. position in the world and, more specifically, that developing countries needed substantial financial assistance in the form of low-interest loans. Developing countries particularly needed softer financing to invest in public health systems, schools, and economic infrastructure, for which [...] "hard," [...] commercial lending was unsuitable. Personnel changes soon reflected this change in the administration’s view: Christian Herter succeeded Herbert Hoover Jr. as Under Secretary of State in February 1957, Robert Anderson succeeded George Humphrey as Treasury Secretary in July 1957, and James H. Smith Jr. replaced John Hollister as ICA Director in September 1957. Pres. Eisenhower summarized the conclusions in his May 21, 1957 message to Congress: [...] "This past year ... Congressional Committees, the Executive Branch and distinguished private citizens have just examined these programs anew. ... I recommend the following legislative actions: ... economic development assistance should be provided primarily through loans, on a continuing basis, and related closely to technical assistance. ... I recommend a clear separation of military and defense support assistance on the one hand, from economic development assistance on the other. ... I recommend that longterm sic development assistance be provided from a Development Loan Fund. ... Such loans should not compete with or replace such existing sources of credit as private investors, the International Bank World Bank, or the Export-Import Bank. ... I believe the Fund should be established and administered in the International Cooperation Administration. ... The technical cooperation program {{is one of the most}} valuable elements of our entire mutual security effort. It also should be continued on a long-term basis and must be closely related to the work of the Fund." [...] As a result, the Development Loan Fund was established in August 1957. The DLF largely financed infrastructure (such as railroads, highways, and power plants), factories, and agriculture with loans whose terms were relatively [...] "soft" [...] in the sense of charging interest rates lower than commercial levels and being repayable in local currency rather than U.S. dollars. Some projects were financed by a combination of a DLF soft loan and a harder World Bank loan. Operationally, the DLF became administratively self-contained by 1959 after contracting for administrative support from ICA for its first two years. Also, the Export-Import Bank's <b>lending</b> <b>limit</b> was raised in 1958 from $5 billion to $7 billion, and the administration advocated in January 1959 an expanded [...] "food for peace" [...] program. In 1958, the administration's shift toward a more expansive policy on development assistance was joined by an increasing number of members of Congress. The President and Congress particularly shifted towards promoting multilateral development assistance, which the European countries and Japan had become able to co-finance thanks to their economic recoveries having reached the point by the late 1950s where they could resume convertibility of their currencies. The USG proposed doubling the World Bank's capitalization in 1958 and approved the final measure that raised it from $10 billion to $21 billion in September 1959. In addition, Senator Mike Monroney was instrumental in winning Congressional approval in July 1958 for a new soft-loan facility for the World Bank, the International Development Association (IDA). This had been recommended as early as 1949 and had been supported by the International Development Advisory Board established by President Truman in 1950 and chaired by Nelson Rockefeller, but it took years before it received Congressional backing. The IDA formally came into being in September 1960, with the U.S. contributing 42% of its initial resources. On the other hand, the U.S. did not support the proposal for a Special UN Fund for Economic Development (SUNFED). The UN [...] "Special Fund" [...] that was created in 1957 was limited to developing projects for the UN's technical assistance program, EPTA, and could not finance public works. Assistance to developing countries took a different course in Latin America than in Asia, continuing through most of the 1950s to focus on technical assistance, with financial assistance sources being limited to the Eximbank and the World Bank. However, events in 1958 -- notably a riot during Vice President Nixon's visit to Caracas, Venezuela in May 1958 -- drew more USG attention back to the region. In August 1958, the USG reversed decades-long opposition to proposals for a regional development bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank was established by the Organization of American States in April 1959, with capital mostly contributed by the borrowing countries. To further engage other wealthy countries in global development assistance, the USG supported the creation of the Aid India Consortium in August 1958, the first of several informal groupings of donors. The USG also supported creation of the Development Assistance Group for the European Marshall Plan organization, the OEEC (Organization of European Economic Co-operation), in January 1960.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, the market share of farm debt owed to {{commercial}} banks has declined sharply. One of the potential reasons for the loss in market share {{is related to the}} legal lending limits on the maximum that banks can loan to individual borrowers;The {{purpose of this study is}} twofold: (1) to develop a simple theoretical market model that incorporates and investigates the effect of legal lending limits on the availability of credit to agricultural borrowers; and (2) to provide empirical evidence of this phenomenon;In the development of the theoretical model, an excess loan demand equation is formed, in which the effects of lending limits and such factors as average farm size and prices paid and received by the farm sector are investigated. To empirically test the effects of these variables on excess loan demand, a statistical model is developed which modifies the theoretical model by employing agricultural banks 2 ̆ 7 responses to a survey undertaken by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago concerning lending limits.
