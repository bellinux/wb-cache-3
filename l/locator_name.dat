50|$|An Internet {{resource}} locator is a locator defined by an Internet resource location standard. A resource location standard {{in conjunction with}} resource description and resource naming standards specifies a comprehensive infrastructure for network-based information dissemination. Mechanisms for mapping between <b>locators,</b> <b>names,</b> and descriptive identifiers.|$|R
5000|$|Often {{the name}} of the village founder or of the first settler {{constitute}} {{the first part of the}} place name (e.g. Oettingen, the founder was Otto; Gerolfingen, the founder was Gerolf, Rappoltsweiler, the founder was Ratbald or Ratbert). Mostly in the former Ostsiedlung area, the <b>locator's</b> <b>name</b> was sometimes included as the first part of the name (e.g. Hanshagen, the locator was Hans).|$|R
30|$|SAIL adopts an ubiquitous, seamless, and {{transparent}} mobility approach. Mobility support is {{not restricted to}} hosts, it covers content (based on NetInf) and virtual entities (based on CloNe), e.g. processes and VMs. NetInf employs unique identification and decoupling from <b>locators.</b> <b>Names</b> are flat, persistent, non-legible, authenticated, and self-certifiable. At the open connectivity services (OConS) level, SAIL employs a dynamic, distributed mobility management solution. The solution is flow-based and includes information collection, network selection, path selection, handover decision making, execution, enforcement, and optimization. More specifically, a modified dynamic mobility anchoring technique is adopted [131].|$|R
6000|$|Rufe watched me, silently smoking, till I came to {{the place}} for the <b>locator's</b> <b>name</b> {{at the end of}} the first copy; and when I {{proposed}} that he should sign, I thought I saw a scare in his eye. [...] "I don't think that'll be necessary," [...] he said slowly; [...] "just you write it down." [...] Perhaps this mighty hunter, who was the most active member of the local school board, could not write. There would be nothing strange in that. The constable of Calistoga is, and has been for years, a bed-ridden man, and, if I remember rightly, blind. He had more need of the emoluments than another, it was explained; and it was easy for him to [...] "depytise," [...] with a strong accent on the last. So friendly and so free are popular institutions.|$|R
40|$|Internet users seek {{solutions}} for mobility, multi-homing, support for localised address management (i. e. via NATs), and end-to-end security. Existing mobility approaches {{are not well}} integrated {{into the rest of}} the Internet architecture, instead primarily being separate extensions that at present are not widely deployed. Because the current approaches to these issues were developed separately, such approaches often are not harmonious when used together. Meanwhile, the Internet has a number of namespaces, for example the IP address or the Domain Name. In recent years, some have postulated that the Internet’s namespaces are not sufficiently rich and that the current concept of an address is too limiting. One proposal, the concept of separating an address into an Identifier and a separate Locator, has been controversial in the Internet community for years. It has been considered within the IETF and IRTF several times, but always was rejected as unworkable. This paper takes the position that evolving the naming in the Internet by splitting the address into separate Identifier and <b>Locator</b> <b>names</b> can provide an elegant integrated solution to the key issues listed above, without changing the core routing architecture, while offering incremental deployability through backwards compatibility with IPv 6...|$|R
40|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{fragility}} of web test cases is the inability of web element locators to work correctly when the web page DOM evolves. Web elements locators are used in web test cases to identify all the GUI objects to operate upon and eventually to retrieve web page content that is compared against some oracle in order {{to decide whether the}} test case has passed or not. Hence, web element locators play an extremely important role in web testing and when a web element locator gets broken developers have to spend substantial time and effort to repair it. While algorithms exist to produce robust web element locators to be used in web test scripts, no algorithm is perfect and different algorithms are exposed to different fragilities when the software evolves. Based on such observation, we propose a new type of <b>locator,</b> <b>named</b> multi-locator, which selects the best locator among a candidate set of locators produced by different algorithms. Such selection is based on a voting procedure that assigns different voting weights to different locator generation algorithms. Experimental results obtained on six web applications, for which a subsequent release was available, show that the multi-locator is more robust than the single locators (about - 30 % of broken locators w. r. t. the most robust kind of single locator) and that the execution overhead required by the multiple queries done with different locators is negligible (2 - 3 % at most) ...|$|R
50|$|A weather broadcast, {{collections}} and store <b>locator</b> iPhone application, <b>named</b> KWeather, {{was released on}} 3 January 2010. This free application allows the user to access information about the weather, to view the current Kipling catalog, and find the nearest Kipling shop. A second iPhone application, named KipMonkey, was released on 7 May 2010. The free application includes a match-three puzzle game with the monkey logo from the G*rilla Girlz collection.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} wireless access considerations behind {{the design of the}} MobilityFirst clean-slate future Internet architecture. The MobilityFirst architecture is motivated by a historic shift of the Internet from the fixed host-server model to one in which access from mobile platforms becomes the norm. This implies the need for a future Internet ar-chitecture designed to handle the special needs of mobile/wireless access efficiently and at large scale. A number of key wireless access network requirements including user/network mobility, varying wireless link quality and disconnection, multi-homing, ad hoc networking, flexible autonomous system boundaries and spectrum coordination are identified along with a brief discussion of the implications for protocol design. This is followed by a summary of the MobilityFirst protocol stack based on separation of <b>names</b> and <b>locators,</b> global <b>name</b> resolution service (GNRS), storage-aware routing with hop-by-hop transport, integrated spectrum management, along with an enhanced edge-aware interdomain routing framework. Selected results from ongoing protocol design and evaluation work are given for key compo-nents such as the GNRS, storage-aware routing and spectrum coordination protocol. I...|$|R
5000|$|There were {{repeated}} calls for Cardiff Blues {{to drop the}} [...] "Cardiff" [...] part of their name to sever links with the old Cardiff RFC identity and {{to move away from}} the traditional light blue kit worn by CRFC. Proponents of this idea point to the Super Rugby tournament where teams such as the Bulls and Crusaders play with no geographic <b>locator</b> in their <b>name.</b> These calls intensified when the Celtic Warriors regional team was dissolved in 2004, bringing old rivals Pontypridd within the catchment area of the Cardiff Blues region. However, there was significant opposition to any such move within the ranks of the club, given that the Cardiff club had won standalone status at a cost of £1,000,000 when the rebranding took place in 2003 (No other club or company have been involved with Cardiff RFC Ltd).|$|R
2500|$|In September 2007, AT {{changed its}} legal policy {{to state that}} [...] "AT may {{immediately}} terminate or suspend all or a portion of your Service, any Member ID, electronic mail address, IP address, Universal Resource <b>Locator</b> or domain <b>name</b> used by you, without notice for conduct that AT believes ... (c) tends to damage the name or reputation of AT, or its parents, affiliates and subsidiaries." [...] By October 10, 2007, AT had altered the terms and conditions for its Internet service to explicitly support freedom of expression by its subscribers, after an outcry claiming the company had given itself the right to censor its subscribers' transmissions. Section 5.1 of AT's new terms of service now reads [...] "AT respects freedom of expression and believes it is a foundation of our free society to express differing points of view. AT will not terminate, disconnect or suspend service because of the views you or we express on public policy matters, political issues or political campaigns." ...|$|R
