The overlap number of a graph is the minimum number of elements needed to form such a representation. We find the overlap numbers of cliques and complete bipartite graphs by relating the problem to previous research in combinatorics. The overlap numbers of paths, cycles, and caterpillars are also established.

Many ENPs have potential adverse impacts on the environment, {{and one of the most}} commonly used ENPs, silver nanoparticle (AgNP), has attracted increased global concern. 	The current study focused on phytotoxicity of AgNPs to a model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Silver nanoparticles were introduced into the growth medium for the wild type A. thaliana plants and root uptake and translocation of AgNPs were examined in hydroponic growth condition. We also conducted growth stage based phenotypic analysis by growing A. thaliana throughout its life cycle in soil. The result indicated that: (1) wild type seeds germination was not affected by either AgNPs or their dissolved Ag+ ions; (2) AgNPs exposure resulted in a concentration- and size- dependent inhibition effect to the root elongation; (3) confocal and electron microscopy indicated that AgNPs could be taken up by seedling roots, yet most of AgNPs attached to the surface of seedling root cap; (4) AgNPs and their dissolved Ag+ ions at tested concentrations had little influence on the vegetative growth of A. thaliana, but they accelerated the floral development; and (5) the effect on the floral development stage reduced the quality of second-generation (F 1) seeds, as indicated by their lower germination rate. In conclusion, AgNPs displayed both acute and chronic phytotoxicity to A. thaliana...|$|E

The paper will focus on the The South China Sea conflict in the pursuance to explain the distinctions that ASEAN’s management of intra-regional confl icts has gained through experience, through realizing its <b>limited</b> <b>containment</b> capacity as far the regional role of great powers is concerned, or through a critical removal of passivism in the confi dence-winning processes of extra-regional partners.

More than 1100 instances of infection with the pandemic A(H 1 N 1) influenza virus from 2009 and 2010 [A(H 1 N 1) 2009] distributed across this period were analyzed. Of these, 19 cases of oseltamivir-resistant virus harboring the H 275 Y mutation in the neuraminidase (NA) were detected. The mean 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) levels for oseltamivir- and zanamivir-susceptible A(H 1 N 1) 2009 viruses were 1. 4 -fold and 2 -fold, respectively, lower than for the seasonal A(H 1 N 1) influenza viruses from 2007 / 2008 : for oseltamivir-resistant A(H 1 N 1) 2009 virus the IC 50 was 2. 9 -fold lower. Eighteen of the 19 patients with oseltamivir-resistant virus showed prolonged shedding of the virus and developed resistance while on oseltamivir therapy. Sixteen of these 18 patients had an immunodeficiency, of whom 11 had a hematologic disorder. The two other patients had another underlying disease. Six of the patients who had an underlying disease died; of these, five had received cytostatic or immunosuppressive therapy. No indications for onward transmission of resistant viruses were found. This study showed that the main association for the emergence of cases of oseltamivir-resistant A(H 1 N 1) 2009 virus was receiving antiviral therapy and having drug-induced immunosuppression or an hematologic disorder. Except for a single case of a resistant virus not linked to oseltamivir therapy, the absence of detection of resistant variants in community specimens and in specimens from contacts of cases with resistant virus suggested that the spread of resistant A(H 1 N 1) 2009 virus was <b>limited.</b> <b>Containment</b> may have been the cumulative result of impaired NA function, successful isolation of the patients, and prophylactic measures to limit exposure.

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} is {{an important}} technique to stimulate coal seam gas extraction by enhancing connectivity between coal seams and wellbore via hydraulically induced fractures. The Efficiency of dewatering and methane production of hydraulically stimulated coal seam gas reservoir is highly depending on the geometry of induced fractures; especially the fracture vertical height which is controlled by different kinds of parameters including in-situ reservoir conditions and stimulation pumping schedules. Field practice shows {{that in many cases}} fracture stimulation was not successful due to the overgrowth of fracture height leading to longer dewatering time and delayed methane production. The {{purpose of this study is}} to perform hydraulic fracturing simulation on a specific coal seam gas reservoir stimulation case to control fracture vertical growth by optimising pumping schedule. First, mini-frac data analysis was performed to determine the in-situ stresses of the coal seams. Next, main fracture analysis was conducted through pressure history match to determine fracture geometry. The simulation was conducted using a 3 D hydraulic fracturing simulator E-Stimplan 3 D. The hydraulically generated fracture was then applied to a compositional reservoir simulator CMG – GEM to perform production history matching. Meantime, a detailed parametric study was also carried out to gain a deep understanding of fracture vertical growth under reservoir condition and to investigate the feasibility of controlling vertical growth by variation of pumping schedule. Based on the sensitivity analysis, an optimised pumping schedule was applied to the simulator to control fracture vertical growth and finally enhanced production estimation was performed and compared with the initial results of stimulation. It can be concluded that while the contrasts of Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio and fracture toughness between pay zone and surrounding layers have <b>limited</b> <b>containment</b> effects, in-situ stresses play a leading role in fracture vertical growth, it is therefore highly important to perform in-situ stress calibration in the simulation of fracture geometry; under reservoir property and in-situ stress conditions, optimising pumping schedule is an effective and feasible method to control fracture vertical growth, reduce dewatering time and enhancemethane production in specific cases...|$|E
40|$|The DOE Spent Nuclear Fuel Disposal Container (SNF DC) {{supports}} the confinement and isolation of waste within the Engineered Barrier System of the Mined Geologic Disposal System (MGDS). Disposal containers are loaded and sealed {{in the surface}} waste handling facilities, transferred to the underground through the access mains, and emplaced in emplacement drifts. The DOE Spent Nuclear Fuel Disposal Container provides long term confinement of DOE SNF waste, and withstands the loading, transfer, emplacement, and retrieval loads and environments. The DOE SNF Disposal Containers provide containment of waste for a designated period of time, and limit radionuclide release thereafter. The disposal containers maintain the waste in a designated configuration, withstand maximum handling and rockfall loads, limit the individual waste canister temperatures after emplacement. The disposal containers also limit the introduction of moderator into the disposal container during the criticality control period, resist corrosion in the expected repository environment, and provide complete or <b>limited</b> <b>containment</b> of waste {{in the event of}} an accident. Multiple disposal container designs may be needed to accommodate the expected range of DOE Spent Nuclear Fuel. The disposal container will include outer and inner barrier walls and outer and inner barrier lids. Exterior labels will identify the disposal container and contents. Differing metal barriers will support the design philosophy of defense in depth. The use of materials with different failure mechanisms prevents a single mode failure from breaching the waste package. The corrosion-resistant inner barrier and inner barrier lid will be constructed of a high-nickel alloy and the corrosion-allowance outer barrier and outer barrier lid will be made of carbon steel. The DOE Spent Nuclear Fuel Disposal Containers interface with the emplacement drift environment by transferring heat from the waste to the external environment and by protecting the DOE waste canisters and their contents from damage/degradation by the external environment. The disposal containers also interface with the SNF by limiting access of moderator and oxidizing agents to the waste.

Holding <b>limits</b> and price <b>containment</b> in California’s emission markets 2 We use {{a set of}} economic experiments to test the effects of two key features of California’s new program for limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The cap & trade scheme included in the program includes two novel features, limits on allowance ownership (or ‘holding limits’) and a tiered price containment reserve sale. These program features are linked by their potential to affect liquidity {{in the market for}} emission allowances. We examine the effects of these features on liquidity and on measures of market performance including efficiency, price discovery, and price variability. We find that tight holding limits have the effect of substantially lowering the number of banked allowances available for trade, hence lowering liquidity. This impairs the ability of traders to smooth prices over time resulting in lower efficiency, less effective price discovery, and higher variability in price. The price containment reserve, while increasing the supply of allowances available to traders, does not appear to mitigate the effects of tight holding limits on market outcomes. As a result, the imposition of holding limits in the allowance market may have the consequence of increasing the likelihood of the market manipulation that they were intended to prevent.

In this paper, we study {{the dynamics of}} spectrum sensing and spectrum allocation functions in cognitive radio context using very practical signal models for the primary users (PUs), including the effects of power amplifier nonlinearities. We start by sensing the spectrum with energy detection-based wideband multichannel spectrum sensing algorithm and continue by investigating optimal resource allocation methods. Along the way, we {{examine the effects of}} spectral regrowth due to the inevitable power amplifier nonlinearities of the PU transmitters. The signal model includes frequency selective block-fading channel models for both secondary and primary transmissions. Filter bank-based wideband spectrum sensing techniques are applied for detecting spectral holes and filter bank-based multicarrier (FBMC) modulation is selected for transmission as an alternative multicarrier waveform to avoid the disadvantage of <b>limited</b> spectral <b>containment</b> of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based multicarrier systems. The optimization technique used for the resource allocation approach considered in this study utilizes the information obtained through spectrum sensing and knowledge of spectrum leakage effects of the underlying waveforms, including a practical power amplifier model for the PU transmitter. This study utilizes a computationally efficient algorithm to maximize the SU link capacity with power and interference constraints. It is seen that the SU transmission capacity depends critically on the spectral containment of the PU waveform, and these effects are quantified in a case study using an 802.11 -g WLAN scenario.|$|R

Conversely, Canada, which was preoccupied with its own sovereignty and content with a <b>limited</b> view of <b>containment,</b> had little interest in American objectives. Instead, Louis St. Laurent's government, influenced by past experiences with Great Power politics, sought to limit the excesses of the Truman administration in order to defend its autonomy. The consequence of this divergence forced officials in Ottawa and Washington to reconsider not only their national security strategies but also their relations with one another...|$|R
40|$|In {{performing}} a measurement, we encounter errors or biases {{from a number}} of sources. Such sources include random error, measuring parameter bias, measuring parameter resolution, operator bias, environmental factors, etc. We estimate the uncertainties due to these errors either by computing a standard deviation from a sample of measurements or by forming an estimate based on experience. Estimates obtained by the former method are labeled Type A estimates and those obtained by the latter method are called Type B estimates. This paper describes statistical distributions that can be applied to both Type A and Type B measurement errors and to equipment parameter biases. Once the statistical distribution for a measurement error or bias is charac-terized, the uncertainty in this error or bias is computed as the standard deviation of the distribution. For Type A estimates, the distribution or “population ” standard deviation is estimated by the sample standard deviation. For Type B estimates, the standard deviation is computed from limits, referred to as error <b>containment</b> <b>limits</b> and from probabilities, referred to as containment probabilities. The degrees of freedom for each uncertainty estimate can often be determined, regardless of whether the estimate is Type A or Type B...|$|R
40|$|During the preclosure {{time period}} (approximately 100 yr), the {{prospective}} geologic repository at Yucca Mountain must provide for public and worker radiological safety and retrievability of emplaced waste. During the postclosure period (10, 000 yr), the repository {{must ensure that}} cumulative radionulclide releases to the accessible environment comply with EPA release <b>limits.</b> Substantially complete <b>containment</b> must be provided by the waste packages for 300 - 1000 yr. All of these functions must be maintained should a severe seismic event occur and must be achieved with reasonably available technology. The seismic phenomena of interest for the preclosure period are vibratory ground motion from a nearby earthquake or underground nuclear explosion (UNE), faulting beneath surface facilities {{that are important to}} safety, and faulting in underground areas of emplaced waste. For the postclosure period, earthquake ground motion, underground faulting, and seismically induced adverse changes in hydrologic conditions have been identified as the most important seismic phenomena to be characterized. The NNWSI Project Site Charcterization Plan describes a number of seismic parameters that are needed for repository design or performance assessment, along with tentative goals for each parameter. Key parameters, goals and current assessments, all subject to change as site characterization progresses, are summarized in this report. 4 refs...|$|R
