The engine has safely supported the space shuttle {{for the last two}} decades and will be required for at least another decade to support human space flight to the international space station. This paper discusses the continued improvements and maturing of the system to its current state and future considerations for its critical role in the nations space program. Discussed are the initiatives of the late 1980 's, which lead to three major upgrades through the 1990 's. The current capabilities of the propulsion system are defined in the areas of highest programmatic importance: ascent risk, in-flight abort thrust, reusability, and operability.

The GH 2 thrusters were tested in a horizontal configuration in order to characterize their performance. In Phase 1, a single thruster was fired to determine the engine performance parameters necessary for scaling a single engine. A cluster configuration, consisting of the 4 thrusters, was tested in Phase 2 to integrate the system and determine their combined performance. Acoustic and overpressure data was collected during both test phases in order to characterize the system's acoustic performance.

40|$|Advanced {{auxiliary}} propulsion system (APS) technology {{has the potential}} to both, increase the payload capability of earth-to-orbit (ETO) vehicles by reducing APS propellant mass, and simplify ground operations and logistics by reducing the number of fluids on the vehicle and eliminating toxic, corrosive propellants. The impact of integrated cryogenic APS on vehicle payloads is addressed. In this system, <b>launch</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> residuals are scavenged from integral launch propulsion tanks for use in the APS. Sufficient propellant is preloaded into the APS to return to earth with margin and noncomplete scavenging assumed. No propellant conditioning is required by the APS, but ambient heat soak is accommodated. High temperature rocket materials enable the use of the unconditioned hydrogen/oxygen in the APS and are estimated to give APS rockets specific impulse of up to about 444 sec. The payload benefits are quantified and compared with an uprated monomethyl hydrazine/nitrogen tetroxide system in a conservative fashion, by assuming a 25. 5 percent weight growth for the hydrogen/oxygen system and a 0 percent weight growth for the uprated system. The combination and scavenging and high performance gives payload impacts which are highly mission specific. A payload benefit of 861 kg (1898 lbm) was estimated for a Space Station Freedom rendezvous mission and 2099 kg (4626 lbm) for a sortie mission, with payload impacts varying with the amount of launch propulsion residual propellants. Missions without liquid propellant scavenging were estimated to have payload penalties, however, operational benefits were still possible...|$|E

40|$|Polyimide {{composites}} {{are being}} evaluated {{for use in}} lightweight support structures designed to preserve the ideal flow geometry within thin shell combustion chambers of future space <b>launch</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems.</b> Principles of lightweight design and innovative manufacturing techniques have yielded a sandwich structure with an outer face sheet of carbon fiber polyimide matrix composite. While the continuous carbon fiber enables laminated skin of high specific stiffness; the polyimide matrix materials ensure that the rigidity and durability is maintained at operation temperatures of 316 C. Significant weight savings over all metal support structures are expected. The protypical structure {{is the result of}} ongoing collaboration, between Boeing and NASA-GRC seeking to introduce polyimide composites to the harsh environmental and loads familiar to space <b>launch</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems.</b> Design trade analyses were carried out using relevant closed form solutions, approximations for sandwich beams/panels and finite element analysis. Analyses confirm the significant thermal stresses exist when combining materials whose coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) differ by a factor of about 10 for materials such as a polymer composite and metallic structures. The ramifications on design and manufacturing alternatives are reviewed and discussed. Due to stringent durability and safety requirements, serious consideration is being given to the synergistic effects of temperature and mechanical loads. The candidate structure operates at 316 C, about 80 % of the glass transition temperature T(sub g). Earlier thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) investigations of chopped fiber polyimide composites made this near to T(sub g), showed that cyclic temperature and stress promoted excessive creep damage and strain accumulation.

40|$|Ever {{since the}} Apollo program ended, the {{development}} of <b>launch</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems</b> in the US has fallen drastically, with only two new booster engine developments, the SSME and the RS- 68, occurring {{in the past few}} decades. 1 In recent years, however, there has been an increased interest in pursuing more effective <b>launch</b> <b>propulsion</b> technologies in the U. S., exemplified by the NASA Office of the Chief Technologist s inclusion of <b>Launch</b> <b>Propulsion</b> <b>Systems</b> as the first technological area in the Space Technology Roadmaps 2. One area of particular interest to both government agencies and commercial entities has been {{the development of}} hydrocarbon engines; NASA and the Air Force Research Lab 3 have expressed interest in the use of hydrocarbon fuels for their respective SLS Booster and Reusable Booster System concepts, and two major commercially-developed launch vehicles SpaceX s Falcon 9 and Orbital Sciences Antares feature engines that use RP- 1 kerosene fuel. Compared to engines powered by liquid hydrogen, hydrocarbon-fueled engines have a greater propellant density (usually resulting in a lighter overall engine), produce greater propulsive force, possess easier fuel handling and loading, and for reusable vehicle concepts can provide a shorter turnaround time between launches. These benefits suggest that a hydrocarbon-fueled launch vehicle would allow for a cheap and frequent means of access to space. 1 However, the time and money required {{for the development of a}} new engine still presents a major challenge. Long and costly design, development, testing and evaluation (DDT&E) programs underscore the importance of identifying critical technologies and prioritizing investment efforts. Trade studies must be performed on engine concepts examining the affordability, operability, and reliability of each concept, and quantifying the impacts of proposed technologies. These studies can be performed through use of the Technology Impact Forecasting (TIF) method. The Technology Impact Forecasting method is a normative forecasting technique that allows the designer to quantify the effects of adding new technologies on a given design. This method can be used to assess and identify the necessary technological improvements needed to close the gap that exists between the current design and one that satisfies all constraints imposed on the design. The TIF methodology allows for more design knowledge to be brought to the earlier phases of the design process, making use of tools such as Quality Function Deployments, Morphological Matrices, Response Surface Methodology, and Monte Carlo Simulations. 2 This increased knowledge allows for more informed decisions to be made earlier in the design process, resulting in shortened design cycle time. This paper will investigate applying the TIF method, which has been widely used in aircraft applications, to the conceptual design of a hydrocarbon rocket engine. In order to reinstate a manned presence in space, the U. S. must develop an affordable and sustainable launch capability. Hydrocarbon-fueled rockets have drawn interest from numerous major government and commercial entities because they offer a low-cost heavy-lift option that would allow for frequent launches 1. However, the development of effective new hydrocarbon rockets would likely require new technologies in order to overcome certain design constraints. The use of advanced design methods, such as the TIF method, enables the designer to identify key areas in need of improvement, allowing one to dial in a proposed technology and assess its impact on the system. Through analyses such as this one, a conceptual design for a hydrocarbon-fueled vehicle that meets all imposed requirements can be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Fluid transients, {{also known}} as water hammer, can have a {{significant}} impact on the design and operation of both spacecraft and <b>launch</b> vehicles <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems.</b> These transients often occur at system activation and shut down. For ground safety reasons, many spacecrafts are launched with the propellant lines dry. These lines are often evacuated by the time the spacecraft reaches orbit. When the propellant isolation valve opens during <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> activation, propellant rushes into lines creating a pressure surge. During propellant system shutdown, a pressure surge is created due to sudden closure of a valve. During both activation and shutdown, pressure surges must be predicted accurately to ensure structural integrity of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> fluid network. The method of characteristics is the most widely used method of calculating fluid transients in pipeline [1, 2]. The method of characteristics, however, has limited applications in calculating flow distribution in complex flow circuits with phase change, heat transfer and rotational effects. A robust cryogenic <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> analyzer must have the capability to handle phase change, heat transfer, chemical reaction, rotational effects and fluid transients in conjunction with subsystem flow model for pumps, valves and various pipe fittings. In recent years, such a task has been undertaken at Marshall Space Flight Center with the development of the Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program (GFSSP), which is based on finite volume method in fluid network [3]. GFSSP has been extensively verified and validated by comparing its predictions with test data and other numerical methods for various applications such as internal flow of turbo-pump [4], propellant tank pressurization [5, 6], chilldown of cryogenic transfer line [7] and squeeze film damper rotordynamics [8].

Liquid rocket boosters for the STS were analyzed as replacements for current solid rocket boosters. These boosters can provide a liquid <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> within the volume constraints of a solid rocket booster. A replacement for the Space Shuttle Main Engines using metallized 02 /H 2 /A 1 was studied. The liquid stages of the Titan 4 were also investigated; the Aerozine- 50 (A- 50) fuel was replaced with metallized storable A- 50 /A 1. A metallized propellant {{is similar to a}} traditional liquid propellant. However, it has metal particles, such as aluminum, that are suspended in a gelled fuel, such as hydrogen, RP- 1, A- 50 or monomethyl hydrazine (MMH). The fuels then undergo combustion with liquid oxygen or nitrogen tetroxide (NTO). These propellants provide options for increasing the performance of existing <b>launch</b> vehicle chemical <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems</b> by increasing fuel density or specific impulse or both. These increases in density and specific impulse can significantly reduce the <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> liftoff weight and allow a liquid rocket booster to fit into the same volume as an existing solid rocket booster. Also, because gelled fuels are akin to liquid propellants, metallized systems can provide enhanced controllability over solid <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems.</b> Gelling of the propellant also reduces the sensitivity to impacts and consequently reduces the propellant explosion hazard...|$|R
40|$|The Modular Rocket Engine Control Software (MRECS) Program is a {{technology}} demonstration effort designed {{to advance the}} state-of-the-art in <b>launch</b> vehicle <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems.</b> Its emphasis is on developing and demonstrating a modular software architecture for a generic, advanced engine control system {{that will result in}} lower software maintenance (operations) costs. It effectively accommodates software requirements changes that occur due to hardware. technology upgrades and engine development testing. Ground rules directed by MSFC were to optimize modularity and implement the software in the Ada programming language. MRECS system software and the software development environment utilize Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products. This paper presents the objectives and benefits of the program. The software architecture, design, and development environment are described. MRECS tasks are defined and timing relationships given. Major accomplishment are listed. MRECS offers benefits {{to a wide variety of}} advanced technology programs in the areas of modular software, architecture, reuse software, and reduced software reverification time related to software changes. Currently, the program is focused on supporting MSFC in accomplishing a Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) hot-fire test at Stennis Space Center and the Low Cost Boost Technology (LCBT) Program...|$|R
