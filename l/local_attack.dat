5|$|In 1945 Deir al-Balah had a {{population}} of 2,560, all Arabs, with 14,735 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 327 dunams were for citrus and bananas, 472 plantations and irrigable land, 14,438 used for cereals, while 39 dunams were built-up land. In the lead-up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, residents of Deir al-Balah participated in a <b>local</b> <b>attack</b> against the nearby kibbutz of Kfar Darom, despite being discouraged by Egyptian Army officers, but they were repelled and suffered casualties. During the war, Egypt captured the town along with other towns {{in an area that}} became known as the Gaza Strip. The Egyptians later established a sharia court system that held jurisdiction over personal affairs. Egyptian rule introduced relative prosperity to Deir al-Balah. The town witnessed a booming citrus industry made possible by the discovery of a substantial reservoir of ground water in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|In early June 1916, the Canadian Corps {{was again}} posted to {{trenches}} around the Belgian town of Ypres. The new {{commander of the}} Canadian Corps, Julian Byng, was inspecting the Corps positions {{in front of a}} German-held rise named Mount Sorrel and noted that the Canadian troops were overlooked by German positions and under constant danger of enemy fire. The Germans also seemed to be digging new sap trenches which implied that an assault was intended. Byng ordered Mercer to make a reconnaissance of the front line and draw up a plan to overrun the more dangerous German positions in a <b>local</b> <b>attack.</b> Mercer complied on the 2 June, conducting a standard inspection of front line Canadian trenches at 08:30.|$|E

25|$|In early 1916, the Germans {{had more}} and better {{equipment}} for trench warfare, with good quality hand grenades, rifle grenades and trench mortars; the Germans made more effort to repair and improve defences and with a homogeneous army, {{found it easier to}} move artillery, ammunition and men along the front. A substantial cadre of the pre-war trained officers and conscripts remained, to lead the wartime recruits. British tunnellers achieved an ascendancy over their German equivalents but in ground operations, the number of operational machine-guns and the volume and accuracy of artillery fire, had more effect than individual skill and bravery; the quantity of heavy guns often determined the course of engagements. The success of a <b>local</b> <b>attack</b> left the victors vulnerable to a counter-attack and captured positions were often more costly to hold, than the previous positions.|$|E
25|$|The {{constant}} rain confined supply {{traffic to}} one road from Longueval to Flers, which was frequently bombarded by German artillery, {{which made the}} difficulties of supply much worse. Another attack was ordered for 5 November and Prior and Wilson described the representations made by Cavan, the XIV Corps commander, who wrote {{that he was willing}} to sacrifice men to support the Sixth Army on the right but that a failure would be no help and could lead to the men losing confidence in their commanders. A <b>local</b> <b>attack</b> on 3 November was another failure and Cavan insisted that Rawlinson witness the conditions at the front. Rawlinson agreed that attacks were futile, which Haig accepted until a meeting with Foch, where he was persuaded to continue to attack. Prior and Wilson wrote that the attack on 5 November was another failure but smaller costly attacks continued for the rest of the month, despite not improving the tactical situation of the Fourth Army.|$|E
2500|$|The German Attack on Vimy Ridge, 21 May (Unternehmen Schleswig-Holstein/Operation Schleswig-Holstein) was a <b>local</b> <b>attack</b> on the Western Front {{during the}} First World War. The Germans {{intended}} to prevent mines being blown under German positions by capturing the British front line and mine gallery entrances. After the Third Battle of Artois (25 September – 4 November 1915) The French Tenth Army had held positions on the western slope of Vimy Ridge and the German 6th Army (Generaloberst [...] Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria) occupied positions on the steeper eastern slope. After {{the beginning of the}} Battle of Verdun (21 February – 18 December 1916), the Tenth Army was withdrawn and the British First Army and Third Army on either flank, took over the French positions.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the results}} of the attack on 18 November were known, the scope of the {{offensive}} was reduced and then washed out by more rain until 3 November.

On 6 November, attacks were only to be made to stop the Germans from moving troops from the Western front and to support the attacks of the Sixth Army.|$|E
2500|$|The rain {{stopped on}} 8 November and on 12 November, the Fourth Army {{headquarters}} ordered a <b>local</b> <b>attack</b> by I Anzac Corps and III Corps {{on either side}} of the Eaucourt l'Abbaye–Le Barque road. The 50th Division was to attack Gird Support Trench and Hook Sap, which connected the Gird trenches with Butte Trench and formed a salient from which all of the ground opposite the 50th Division could be swept by cross-fire. The 1/5th Northumberland were to attack up to Hook Sap on the right and the 1/7th Northumberland on the left flank were to capture Hook Sap, Gird Trench and Bind Trench. The rains returned, trenches flooded and left patches of mud thigh-deep. The attackers assembled in Abbaye, Snag and Snag Support trenches. At dawn the butte became visible to the left, the British barrage began at [...] and German SOS rockets made [...] "pencils of golden rain" [...] in the sky.|$|E
2500|$|The German {{artillery}} reply {{began with}} a substantial counter-bombardment but this rapidly diminished, especially south of the Ailette, where the supply of ammunition and equipment was blocked by the thick gas cloud in the valley. Some guns were withdrawn but on 19 October, the gas cloud was so thickened by fog that it became impossible to move the rest. Positions held by the 14th Division in Group Crépy {{and those of the}} 13th Division and 2nd Guard Division in Group Vailly were quickly reduced to crater-fields. French aircrew watched fortifications and tunnel-openings for signs of occupancy and immediately directed artillery-fire on any which were seen. The French bombardment had most effect at the boundary of the 13th Division and 2nd Guard Division, where by the night of 21 October, a gap [...] wide had been blown in the German defences, which could not be repaired. On the eastern flank of the attack front, the bombardment of the 5th Guard Division was less damaging but a <b>local</b> <b>attack,</b> Operation Autumn Harvest was cancelled.|$|E

2500|$|The Loss of the Kink Salient {{occurred}} during a <b>local</b> <b>attack</b> on 11 May 1916, by the 3rd Bavarian Division on {{the positions of}} the 15th (Scottish) Division at the west end of the [...] Redoubt near Loos, on the Western Front. An unprecedented bombardment demolished the British front line specially trained German assault units rushed the survivors and captured the British front line and the second line of defence, trapped British tunnellers in their galleries and took them prisoner. Hasty counter-attacks by the British were repulsed amidst darkness, smoke and dust, which left British artillery observers unable to see the front line. The British guns continued to fire on the German front line, for long after the German raiders had crossed no man's land but an organised counter-attack at [...] was conducted with artillery support. The counter-attack made progress at Hussar Horn but was abandoned, {{in the early hours of}} 12 May. A final attempt to recapture the lost ground on 14 May was defeated and the British consolidated a new line further back, on ground less exposed than the Kink.|$|E

During the Battle of Albert [...] 1914 the II Bavarian Corps attacked westwards north of the Somme but was fought to a standstill east of Mametz. Reinforced by the XIV Reserve Corps the Germans on the north side of the Somme attacked again and took Mametz on 29 September. After a mutually costly battle for Fricourt, where the French were eventually forced out, the front line stabilised and both sides began to dig improvised defences. In mid-December the French conducted a <b>local</b> <b>attack</b> in the Mametz area but were repulsed with many casualties.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 July Haig met Rawlinson and {{directed}} that attacks should {{continue on the}} right flank, although Rawlinson was concerned over a lack of heavy howitzer ammunition. On 3 July Haig met Joffre and Foch and {{announced that he was}} concentrating British efforts south of the Albert–Bapaume road, despite Joffre's objections. The Fourth Army would continue the attack between Montauban and Fricourt, before attacking the German second position, from Longueval to Bazentin-le-Petit, as the Reserve Army advanced north-east towards Pozières. The attack front was shortened by [...] and XIII Corps and XV Corps were to consolidate their positions, then advance towards Trônes Wood and Mametz Wood. Front-line officers in XIII Corps reported that German resistance was weak and that delay would give the defence time to recover. Congreve, the XIII Corps commander, instructed the 30th Division and 9th Division commanders to capture Trônes Wood, before a general attack on the Fourth Army front intended for 10 July. A <b>local</b> <b>attack</b> was planned, in support of the French, for the morning of 7 July, on high ground at Maltz Horn Farm and Hardecourt, which overlooked the south end of Trônes Wood.

On 16 July discussions about the attack resumed, as the need for diversions to coincide with operations on the Somme had diminished when the big victory of Bazentin Ridge (14 July 1916) had not led to a general German collapse. Sir Douglas Haig the Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, did not want the attack to take place unless the local commanders were confident of success and Monro and Haking opposed postponement or cancellation of the attack. The weather had been dull on 15 July and rain began next day, soon after Monro and Haking made the decision to proceed with the attack.
