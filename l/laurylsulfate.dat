We used cetyltrimethylammonium <b>laurylsulfate</b> and tricaprylmethylammonium <b>laurylsulfate</b> as sensing materials (active substance). The electrochemical {{properties of the}} electrodes were studied and {{the functions of the}} electrodes were tested. We selected the best membrane composition considering the best slope and the largest linear response domain. The membrane composition with the best electrochemical characteristics was that based on tricaprylmethylammonium <b>laurylsulfate</b> plasticized with dioctylsebaccate (nearnerstinan slope: 58, 56 mV/pC and concentration range of linear response 5 x 10 - 3 - 2 x 10 - 6 M of <b>laurylsulfate).</b> The electrode function of these electrodes presents an abrupt change at critical micellar point. This property makes possible their utilization to critical micellar concentration, an important property of surfactants solution.

Recently, we demonstrated that lysophosphatidylcholine caused cardiac arrhythmia in the isolated hamster heart. In this study, the arrhythmogenic nature of various lysophosphoglycerides with respect to acyl chain lengths and base groups were assessed. We demonstrated that all naturally occurring lysolipids tested were arrhythmogenic at 0. 05 - 0. 10 mM. Arrhythmia were also observed with Triton X- 100 or sodium <b>laurylsulfate</b> at 0. 05 - 0. 10 mM.

40|$|Interactions {{between the}} {{polymers}} and surfactants in solution have widely been investigated {{because of their}} scientific and technological importance. These interactions can be utilized to modify the physicochemical properties of system in many food products, pharmaceutical formulations, personal care products, paints, pesticides, etc. Interaction between nonionic polymer - hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) and anionic surfactant - sodium <b>laurylsulfate</b> (SDS) in solution has been investigated in this paper by rheological measurements. Rheological measurements are performed by rotational viscometer at 20 °C and changes of rheological characteristics of HPMC solutions (0. 5 - 1. 5 %) with increasing SDS concentrations (0 - 4. 0 %) were determined. The results of these investigations showed that viscosity of the solution is dependant on HPMC-SDS interaction. At particular SDS concentration viscosity increases, reach maximum and after that decreases until reach constant value. From the viscosity changes the characteristic concentrations of SDS, critical aggregation concentration (cac) and polymer saturation point (psp), were determined. These concentrations are in linear relationships with HPMC concentrations. Rheological properties of the solution are strong influenced by HPMC-SDS interaction and exhibits more or less pronounced pseudoplastic behavior, which changes to Newtonian one after the psp has been reached...|$|E

Work also focuses on various form of colloidal nanocarriers. The focus of the diploma lies in the experiment. The main aim of the thesis was to prepare detailed study of influence of a very low concentrations of anionic sodium <b>laurylsulfate</b> and cationic cetyltrimethylamonium bromide on size and zetapotential of nanoparticles prepared by emulsionsolvent - distribution method from terpolymer of DL-lactid acid, glycolic acid and tripenterthritol.

40|$|Silicon {{image sensor}} (SIS) {{technology}} was recently introduced as an innovative tool (SkinChip, L'Oreal) providing sensitive imaging {{of the skin}} capacitance. This method can detect discrete focal variations in skin surface hydration, and thus early discrete manifestations of skin irritation induced by surfactants. In the present in vivo study, 2 neat and diluted shampoos, and 5 % and 10 % sodium <b>laurylsulfate</b> solutions were tested on human skin. Each surfactant solution was gently rubbed on the skin using wet hair wicks mimicking the casual use of a shampoo on the scalp. Clinical and SIS evaluations were carried out. In addition, the same products were tested using the ex vivo corneosurfametry bioassay performed on human stratum corneum (SC) harvested by cyanoacrylate skin surface strippings. The colourimetric index of mildness (CIM) was measured on these samples. The product reactivity with the SC was recognized by darker skin capacitance images, and by both lowered SkinChip-generated values and lowered CIM values. The extent in changes varied according {{to the nature of}} the test products and their concentrations. The SkinChip image changes likely corresponded to the acute surfactant-induced water swelling of the corneocytes. Skin capacitance imaging and corneosurfametry allow to disclose discrete surfactant-induced alterations of corneocytes. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHigh {{negative}} {{electric potential}} inside mitochondria provides {{a driving force}} for mitochondria-targeted delivery of cargo molecules linked to hydrophobic penetrating cations. This principle is utilized in construction of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants (MTA) carrying quinone moieties which produce a number of health benefitting effects by protecting cells and organisms from oxidative stress. Here, a series of penetrating cations including MTA were shown to induce {{the release of the}} liposome-entrapped carboxyfluorescein anion (CF), but not of glucose or ATP. The ability to induce the leakage of CF from liposomes strongly depended on the number of carbon atoms in alkyl chain (n) of alkyltriphenylphosphonium and alkylrhodamine derivatives. In particular, the leakage of CF was maximal at n about 10 – 12 and substantially decreased at n= 16. Organic anions (palmitate, oleate, <b>laurylsulfate)</b> competed with CF for the penetrating cation-induced efflux. The reduced activity of alkylrhodamines with n= 16 or n= 18 as compared to that with n= 12 was ascribed to a lower rate of partitioning of the former into liposomal membranes, because electrical current relaxation studies on planar bilayer lipid membranes showed rather close translocation rate constants for alkylrhodamines with n= 18 and n= 12. Changes in the alkylrhodamine absorption spectra upon anion addition confirmed direct interaction between alkylrhodamines and the anion. Thus, mitochondria-targeted penetrating cations can serve as carriers of hydrophobic anions across bilayer lipid membranes...|$|E
40|$|Separations of {{proteins}} at acid pH {{in the presence}} of a high concentration of surfactant [sodium <b>laurylsulfate</b> (SDS), 50 mmol / l] was investigated. The purpose of using high concentrations of SDS as background electrolyte modifier was threefold: First, the surfactant exerts a washing effect upon the capillary wall thus preventing binding of analytes and possible clogging of the capillary. Second, it was revealed that even under very acid conditions (below pH 3) the surfactant is capable of forming associates with protein analytes which still bear considerable negative charge and can be separated on this basis. Third, the system can be applied not only for protein mixtures sufficiently soluble in neutral to alkaline media (leukocyte lysates, standard proteins), but it can be used also with proteins, that are under such conditions virtually insoluble and their solubilization is possible in acid buffers only (eggshell proteins or collagen CNBr fragments). The result was that adsorption to the capillary wall was minimized and the analytes were separated as negatively charged associates with high efficiency. With collagen fragments partition was possible on the affinity differences of the peptides to the surfactant micelles and inner wall of the capillary. Theoretical plate counts approaching 100 000 were easily achieved even with proteins which under the more conventional operation conditions exhibit considerable sticking to the capillary wall. The other feature of this system is that the associates move very rapidly to the anode. Owing to the low pH, endoosmotic flow is negligible, an...|$|E
40|$|In {{a series}} of {{previous}} experiments, we showed that the inflammatory response associated with skin barrier function damage induced by sodium <b>laurylsulfate</b> (SLS) was correlated with the concentration of SLS and with the duration of application under occlusion of the surfactant. In this experiment, we measured accumulation of unbound water that occurred when occlusive contact was maintained during {{a short period of}} time between the skin and the probe head of an electrometric device. Accumulation of unbound water was expressed as area under the curve (sum of increments of skin capacitance during a 45 -second period of time; AUCC). For comparative purposes, we also measured transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Both skin function parameters were established for each individual skin site before and 24 h after removal of SLS patches (10, 5, 1 and 0 % control solution under occlusion for 48 h). After SLS insult, AUCC and TEWL were increased, and changes were related to SLS concentration (p less than 0. 0002). There was a linear correlation between AUCC and log TEWL (p less than 0. 0002). On normal skin before application of SLS both parameters were also correlated (p less than 0. 04). The regression line between AUCC and log TEWL of normal skin differed however from that observed on SLS-pretreated sites. This indicates that electrometric data are able to simultaneously characterize changes in skin hydration, a rather static parameter, and changes in the amount of unbound water accumulation (AUCC), a dynamic parameter which proved to reflect TEWL...|$|E
40|$|Bleach sputum {{concentration}} and fluorescence microscopy (FM) are reportedly {{more sensitive than}} direct Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) sputum smears for tuberculosis detection, and might be particularly valuable for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -positive patients excreting fewer bacilli. This study, implemented in Yaoundé, Cameroon, determined the yield from both direct and bleach-concentrated FM and ZN duplicate smears against culture on Löwenstein-Jensen medium, with HIV testing from the sputa. From 418 HIV-positive and 518 HIV-negative tuberculosis suspects, 185 (44. 3 %) and 243 (46. 9 %) cultures, respectively, grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Direct ZN was positive for, respectively, 87 (47. 0 %) and 202 (83. 1 %) of the culture-positive cases. Proportional incremental yield over direct ZN from ZN and FM bleach smears was 14. 9 % (P < 10 (- 3)) and 17. 2 % (P < 10 (- 4)) for HIV-positive versus 4. 9 % (P < 10 (- 2)) and 2. 0 % (non-significant) for HIV-negative cases. There was no gain from direct FM. Bleach FM showed 2 % excess false positives. The bleach concentration, therefore, increases the yield of ZN and FM, particularly from HIV-positive patients, but with a higher risk for false positives with bleach FM. With excellent baseline direct ZN, the gain remains modest. Field studies under real-life conditions are needed {{to determine whether it}} is worth the risks and operational challenges in HIV high-prevalence populations. FM was not more sensitive than ZN in this study, probably because of sub-optimal objective power and background staining. Culture on solid media with sparing <b>laurylsulfate</b> decontamination was clearly superior for HIV-positives, but {{it remains to be seen}} if culture also leads to more cases started on treatment routinely...|$|E
40|$|Even though various {{experimental}} {{methods have been}} proposed for in vitro testing of detergents such as LSL (sodium <b>laurylsulfate)</b> no absolutely relevant clinical information can be inferred from them as to the irritancy of a given compound. In particular {{the relative importance of}} pH needs further assessment. This study reports on in vivo evaluation of skin function changes under given experimental conditions with SLS applied at 3 different pH values. There is a dramatic increase of transepidermal water loss (TEWL), i. e. a substantial reduction in the barrier function of the skin, when SLS is applied under occlusion for 48 H. The alkaline control solution (NaOH pH 9) induced low-grade, but significant TEWL increases, as compared to the other controls (distilled water pH 7; HCl pH 5), which had no influence on TEWL. The changes obtained with the controls were much lower than those observed with SLS. The barrier-function changes induced by the surfactant SLS could, however, promote transepidermal passage of acid and/or alkaline molecules, hence increasing toxic damage of the skin; yet no such effects could be observed, indicating that the main effects are due to detergency. Assessment of cutaneous blood flow values (CBFV) by laser Doppler velocimetry showed increased values after SLS. When pH-adjusted SLS solutions were compared, there was neither a difference in relation to pH nor did the control solutions induce any significant CBFV change. This study reveals that TEWL and CBFV are probably the most reliable methods to investigate acute irritancy by SLS. Accordingly, pH cannot be considered as a major contributive factor of irritancy when SLS solutions are applied under occlusion (48 h). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
