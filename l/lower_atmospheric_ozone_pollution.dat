The basic processes are illustrated with a one-dimensional time-dependent model that is closer to true meteorological motions than commonly used eddy diffusion models. Its application to a representative region of South America gives reasonable simulations of the local pollutants measured there. Three illustrative simulations indicate the importance of dilution, principally due to vertical transport, in increasing the efficiency of ozone production, possibly enough for high ozone to be apparent on a very large, intercontinental scale...|$|R

40|$|The magnitude, spatial, and {{temporal}} {{patterns of the}} terrestrial carbon sink and the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain {{and need to be}} investigated. China is important in determining the global carbon balance in terms of both carbon emission and carbon uptake. Of particular importance to climate-change policy and carbon management is the ability to evaluate the relative contributions of multiple environmental factors to net carbon source and sink in China's terrestrial ecosystems. Here the effects of multiple environmental factors (climate, <b>atmospheric</b> CO(2), <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution,</b> nitrogen deposition, nitrogen fertilizer application, and land cover/land use change) on net carbon balance in terrestrial ecosystems of China for the period 1961 - 2005 were modeled with newly developed, detailed historical information of these changes. For this period, results from two models indicated a mean land sink of 0. 21 Pg C per year, with a multimodel range from 0. 18 to 0. 24 Pg C per year. The models' results are consistent with field observations and national inventory data and provide insights into the biogeochemical mechanisms responsible for the carbon sink in China's land ecosystems. In the simulations, nitrogen deposition and fertilizer applications together accounted for 61 percent of the net carbon storage in China's land ecosystems in recent decades, with atmospheric CO(2) increases and land use also functioning to stimulate carbon storage. The size of the modeled carbon sink over the period 1961 - 2005 was reduced by both <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> and climate change. The modeled carbon sink in response to per unit nitrogen deposition shows a leveling off or a decline in some areas in recent years, although the nitrogen input levels have continued to increase...|$|R
40|$|High {{concentrations}} of ozone in urban and industrial regions worldwide {{have long been}} a major air quality issue. With the rapid increase in fossil fuel consumption in China {{over the past three}} decades, the emission of chemical precursors to ozone—nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds—has increased sharply, surpassing that of North America and Europe and raising concerns about worsening <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> in China. Historically, research and control have prioritized acid rain, particulate matter, and more recently fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5). In contrast, less is known about <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution,</b> partly {{due to a lack of}} monitoring of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> and its precursors until recently. This review summarizes the main findings from published papers on the characteristics and sources and processes of ozone and ozone precursors in the boundary layer of urban and rural areas of China, including concentration levels, seasonal variation, meteorology conducive to photochemistry and pollution transport, key production and loss processes, ozone dependence on nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, and the effects of ozone on crops and human health. Ozone concentrations exceeding the ambient air quality standard by 100 – 200 % have been observed in China's major urban centers such as Jing-Jin-Ji, the Yangtze River delta, and the Pearl River delta, and limited studies suggest harmful effect of ozone on human health and agricultural corps; key chemical precursors and meteorological conditions conductive to <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> have been investigated, and inter-city/region transport of ozone is significant.

We studied {{the interactions of}} Bt toxin production and chronic ozone exposure in Bt cry 1 Ac-transgenic oilseed rape {{and found that the}} insect resistance trait is robust under ozone elevations. Bt Cry 1 Ac concentrations were higher in the leaves of Bt oilseed rape grown under elevated ozone compared to control treatment, measured either per leaf fresh weight or per total soluble protein of leaves. The mean relative growth rate of a Bt target herbivore, Plutella xylostella L. larvae was negative on Bt plants in all ozone treatments. On the non-transgenic plants, larval feeding damage was reduced under elevated ozone.

For the 27 -year period 1933 - 1959 inclusive, highly {{significant}} negative correlation is {{found between the}} relative sunspot number and the worldwide average of total <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> Peak correlation {{with respect to the}} present-day 10 -year sunspot cycle is found at a lag of 1 •/ • to 2 years of the sunspots relative to ozone. The peak correlation of total <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> with the mean latitudinal distance from the solar equator of the total area of sunspots is almost identical in magnitude to that with sunspot number. Itowever, the peak correlation with sunspot latitude is found at a lag of less than 6 months of the ozone relative to sunspot latitude, in the opposite direction to that with sunspot number. This phase difference of the negative correlation suggests that <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> is much more sensitive to sunspot latitude than to sunspot number.

In result of chemical degradation on the polymer consist of problems such as discoloration, brittleness, surface cracks, perspiration, crumbling, smell, surface acidity. In this work, it is aimed to improve the problem of the polystyrene (PS) material against chemical degradation. For this reason, PS is coated with silica sol-gel hybrid coating. Silica sol-gel was synthesized by using vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) as a cross-linker and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as a silica source. Firstly, four different pre-treatment technique (oven, vacuum oven, lyophilizer and freezing) was studied to determine the most suitable pre-treatment technique for coating on PS substrate of sol-gel prepared with initial formulation (S 1). A freezing technique gave the best results for coating sample. The change of surface colour of coated PS was measured by CIE L*a*b* methods. Secondly, the most suitable curing agent (Irgacure 184, Irgacure 819, Darocur 1173 and TiO 2 as crystalline anatase phase) was determined to coat the sol-gel on PS.

40|$|Naturally {{emitted from}} the oceans, iodine {{compounds}} efficiently destroy <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> and reduce its positive radiative forcing {{effects in the}} troposphere. Emissions of inorganic iodine have been experimentally shown {{to depend on the}} deposition to the oceans of tropospheric ozone, whose concentrations have significantly increased since 1850 as a result of human activities. A chemistry–climate model is used herein to quantify the current ocean emissions of inorganic iodine and assess the impact that the anthropogenic increase in tropospheric ozone has had on the natural cycle of iodine in the marine environment since pre-industrial times. Our results indicate that the human-driven enhancement of tropospheric ozone has doubled the oceanic inorganic iodine emissions following the reaction of ozone with iodide at the sea surface. The consequent build-up of atmospheric iodine, with maximum enhancements of up to 70 % with respect to pre-industrial times in continental pollution outflow regions, has in turn accelerated the ozone chemical loss over the oceans with strong spatial patterns. We suggest that this ocean–atmosphere interaction represents a negative geochemical feedback loop by which current ocean emissions of iodine act as a natural buffer for <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> and its radiative forcing in the global marine environment...|$|R
