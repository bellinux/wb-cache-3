50|$|Socionics divides {{people into}} 16 {{different}} types, called sociotypes. They are most {{commonly referred to}} by their two strongest functions, which in socionics are called the <b>leading</b> <b>function</b> (Jungs dominant) and the creative function (Jungs auxiliary). The creative function is opposite to the <b>leading</b> <b>function</b> in extraversion and rationality. For example, if the dominant function is introverted logic (a rational and introverted function), the secondary function must be irrational and extraverted, which means it must be either extraverted sensing or extraverted intuition.|$|E

Teamwork means quality leadership which is necessary for a successful team management. In the theory and the practice are given a number of models for teamwork and team leadership, however, in this case the subject of this paperwork will be the analyzing of the model of team leadership according to Hill. According to this model there are two <b>functions</b> of team <b>leading</b> established: <b>leading</b> <b>functions</b> in the team and <b>leading</b> <b>functions</b> out of the team. In the first part, which refers to the functions of leadership in the team, are set two major categories: team leader’s tasks and the built relationships and atmosphere in the team. In terms of the functions of the leader out of the team, the model focuses on two categories, namely: the functions of leadership out of the team, but within the organization and <b>leading</b> <b>functions</b> of the team outside the organization...|$|R

We generalize the ordinary differential equation method for analyzing stochastic processes to this case, by introducing <b>leading</b> <b>functions</b> that “lead ” the stochastic process across the discontinuities, which yields approximation results for the asymptotic behavior of the stochastic dynamic.

50|$|Relations of semi-duality {{are similar}} to {{relations}} of duality. Semi-duality occurs between partners who lead (by <b>leading</b> <b>function)</b> each other's dual-seeking (5th) functions but lack each other's creative functions (to assist their mobilizing functions). As a result, both partners often perceive elements of duality from the relationship but feel the other partner is misplacing the correct emphasis; as semi-duals {{will be able to}} help their partners with their dual seeking functions but both have the least confidence in the same area of the psyche (thinking, feeling, sensing, or intuition).|$|E

5000|$|In dual relations, the <b>leading</b> <b>{{function}}</b> of {{one partner}} is the suggestive {{function of the}} other, and the creative function of one partner is the mobilizing function of the other. Thus, the ego functions (the strongest and most socialized) of each correspond to the super-id functions of the other (the area where the person needs and expects assistance). Likewise, the super-ego block of one corresponds to the id of the other. In this relation, just 1 of 4 Jungian dichotomies is shared—rationality/irrationality. Duality interaction is generally rewarding and satisfying for both parties, providing inspiration and support. Duality is a central theme of the philosophy of socionics study: Augusta often stated her position {{that a person who}} is estranged from contact with a dual partner must cope by unnaturally distorting their personality, a phenomenon called [...] "type masking". Relationships with conflictor types are cited as particularly troublesome: {{it is not uncommon for}} a person in a close relationship with their conflictor to develop an acute neurotic condition.|$|E
50|$|Aušra Augustinavičiūtė usually used {{names like}} sensory-logical {{introvert}} (SLI) {{to refer to}} the types. In SLI the <b>leading</b> <b>function</b> is introverted sensation and the creative function is extraverted logic. She also introduced the practice of referring to types by the name of a famous person of the type (although types of these persons are not universally agreed upon, with the old name Napoleon for the SEE being replaced by Caesar after being deemed an inaccurate type assignment). For example, she called the SLI Gabin and the SEI Dumas. Also sometimes names such as Craftsman or Mediator are used to express the social role of the type—a convention introduced by socionist Viktor Gulenko in 1995. Given the formal similarities present between Socionics and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) abbreviations frequently used in English, some prefer to distinguish socionic type names from Myers-Briggs names by writing the last letter (J or P) in lower case (for example, ENTp, ESFj)—a practice introduced by Sergei Ganin. This is because the relationship between socionics and Myers-Briggs and Keirseyan types is controversial.|$|E

50|$|His {{career began}} Mittasch first in 1903 in {{mountain}} Stol with {{the manufacture of}} lead and zinc manufacture. After a short time he received there already thanks to his Kenntnisreichheit a <b>leading</b> <b>function</b> in the metal metallurgical engineering. However, after only one year he changed on recommendation of his supervisor {{at that time to}} the BASF where he took up his activity as an assistant from Carl Bosch. Besides, he took part in the attempts with which nitrogen about Metallnitride as well as Metallcyanide should be fixed. In 1909 Mittasch began production on the base from Eisenoxid in whose result approx. 20,000 attempts were carried out for the optimisation with the systematic search for a catalyst to the ammonia. The found catalyst (iron (II/III) oxide Fe3O4, K2O, CaO, Al2O3 and SiO2) allowed the large-scale technical ammoniated synthesis and is nearly unchanged till this day in use. By his great success Mittasch became 1918 research leaders of the then new-founded ammoniated laboratory of the BASF. Not only this start of the efficient catalyst to ammoniated production decreases to Mittasch but also the catalytic ammoniated oxidation to the nitric acid production, the high-pressure methanol synthesis (together with Matthias Pier in 1923) with mixing oxide catalysts (Zn(II) oxide and Chromium(III) oxide), as well as the Hochdruckcarbonylprozesse to the production of the purest metals such as nickel. The results of his works are held on in 85 patents which he announced mostly with his employees. For his knowledge and his engagement received numerous honours for his works, including the honorary doctorate of the universities TH Munich and LwH Berlin, as well as the appointment the professor by the government of Baden-Wurttemberg.

40|$|An {{effective}} way to perpetuate an academic discipline is to identify and to define its intellectual and historical roots, then to set such roots in the foundation textbooks and courses of the discipline. In that regard, Business Communication still struggles to establish its roots {{when compared to other}} disciplines in business schools, particularly Management. For this study, we undertook an extensive review of significant scholarly works on Business Communication as a discipline. We discovered there are prevalent themes in the broader context of rhetoric, technology, culture, dissemination, and impression; and this was confirmed by our examining the tables of contents for five leading Business Communication textbooks. We also found in the tables of contents for five leading management textbooks that all professional communication areas were placed under the <b>leading</b> <b>function.</b> Based on these findings, we recommend that Business Communication scholars, authors, and teachers embrace the five themes of business communication under the <b>leading</b> <b>function</b> to better establish and promote Business Communication as a discipline...|$|E

Furthermore, the question on the Greek influence found in the early Roman Law is still much discussed. Many scholars consider it unlikely that the patricians sent an official delegation to Greece, as the Roman historians believed. Instead, those scholars suggest, the Romans acquired Greek legislations from the Greek cities of Magna Graecia, the main portal between the Roman and Greek worlds. The original text of the Twelve Tables has not been preserved. The tablets were probably destroyed when Rome was conquered and burned by the Gauls in 387 BC.|$|R

30|$|Thus, {{the roles}} {{approach}} does not substitute the process approach, but consists of autonomous and independent layers of a managerial process (Carroll and Gillen 1987; Fells, 2000; Lamond, 2004; Wren, 1994).

Therefore, these possible complementarities should motivate attempts to integrate the two approaches, since together they could better clarify what the manager does.
