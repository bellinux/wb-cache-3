5|$|Arfwedson later {{showed that}} this same element {{was present in}} the {{minerals}} spodumene and lepidolite. In 1818, Christian Gmelin {{was the first to}} observe that <b>lithium</b> salts give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of <b>lithium</b> oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of <b>lithium,</b> such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (<b>lithium</b> oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of <b>lithium</b> to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of <b>lithium</b> were produced through the electrolysis of <b>lithium</b> chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of <b>lithium</b> in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of <b>lithium</b> chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the higher}} {{electronegativity}} of <b>lithium,</b> some of its compounds have a more covalent character. For example, <b>lithium</b> iodide (LiI) will dissolve in organic solvents, a property of most covalent compounds. <b>Lithium</b> fluoride (LiF) is the only alkali halide that is not soluble in water, and <b>lithium</b> hydroxide (LiOH) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent.|$|E
5|$|Estimates for the Earth's crustal content {{range from}} 20 to 70 ppm by weight. In keeping with its name, <b>lithium</b> forms a minor part of igneous rocks, {{with the largest}} {{concentrations}} in granites. Granitic pegmatites also provide the greatest abundance of lithium-containing minerals, with spodumene and petalite being the most commercially viable sources. Another significant mineral of <b>lithium</b> is lepidolite. A newer source for <b>lithium</b> is hectorite clay, the only active development of which is through the Western <b>Lithium</b> Corporation in the United States. At 20mg <b>lithium</b> per kg of Earth's crust, <b>lithium</b> is the 25th most abundant element.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lithium</b> and its {{compounds}} {{have several}} industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, <b>lithium</b> grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, <b>lithium</b> batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than three quarters of <b>lithium</b> production.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lithium</b> {{fluoride}} is {{the only}} alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water, and <b>lithium</b> hydroxide {{is the only}} alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent. Conversely, <b>lithium</b> perchlorate and other <b>lithium</b> salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li+ has a high solvation energy. This effect also means that most simple <b>lithium</b> salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic: this allows salts like <b>lithium</b> chloride and <b>lithium</b> bromide {{to be used in}} dehumidifiers and air-conditioners.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lithium</b> is {{corrosive}} {{and requires}} special handling to avoid skin contact. Breathing <b>lithium</b> dust or <b>lithium</b> compounds (which are often alkaline) initially irritate {{the nose and}} throat, while higher exposure can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema. The metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the caustic <b>lithium</b> hydroxide. <b>Lithium</b> is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as naphtha.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lithium</b> {{is useful}} in the {{treatment}} of bipolar disorder. <b>Lithium</b> salts may also be helpful for related diagnoses, such as schizoaffective disorder and cyclic major depression. The active part of these salts is the <b>lithium</b> ion Li+. They may increase the risk of developing Ebstein's cardiac anomaly in infants born to women who take <b>lithium</b> during the first trimester of pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lithium</b> {{reacts with}} water easily, but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals. The {{reaction}} forms hydrogen gas and <b>lithium</b> hydroxide in aqueous solution. Because of its reactivity with water, <b>lithium</b> is usually {{stored in a}} hydrocarbon sealant, often petroleum jelly. Though the heavier alkali metals {{can be stored in}} more dense substances, such as mineral oil, <b>lithium</b> is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids. In moist air, <b>lithium</b> rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of <b>lithium</b> hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), <b>lithium</b> nitride (Li3N) and <b>lithium</b> carbonate (Li2CO3, the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2).|$|E
5|$|<b>Lithium</b> {{vanadium}} oxide {{has been proposed}} {{for use as a}} high energy density anode for <b>lithium</b> ion batteries, at 745Wh/L when paired with a <b>lithium</b> cobalt oxide cathode. Vanadium phosphates have been proposed as the cathode in the <b>Lithium</b> Vanadium Phosphate Battery, another type of <b>lithium</b> ion battery.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lithium,</b> sodium, and {{potassium}} have many applications, while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts {{but do not}} have many applications yet. <b>Lithium</b> is often used in batteries, and <b>lithium</b> oxide can help process silica. <b>Lithium</b> stearate is a thickener {{and can be used}} to make lubricating greases; it is produced from <b>lithium</b> hydroxide, which is also used to absorb carbon dioxide in space capsules and submarines. <b>Lithium</b> chloride is used as a brazing alloy for aluminium parts. Metallic <b>lithium</b> is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys.|$|E
5|$|Many other <b>lithium</b> {{compounds}} {{are used}} as reagents to prepare organic compounds. Some popular compounds include <b>lithium</b> aluminium hydride (LiAlH4), <b>lithium</b> triethylborohydride, n-Butyllithium and tert-butyllithium are commonly used as extremely strong bases called superbase.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of <b>lithium</b> ion batteries increased {{the demand for}} <b>lithium</b> and became the dominant use in 2007. With the surge of <b>lithium</b> demand in batteries in the 2000s, new companies have expanded brine extraction efforts to meet the rising demand.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} the <b>lithium</b> atom verges on instability, since the two stable <b>lithium</b> {{isotopes}} found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, <b>lithium</b> is less common {{in the solar system}} than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. For related reasons, <b>lithium</b> has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of <b>lithium</b> atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction, and <b>lithium</b> deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{third most}} common use of <b>lithium</b> is in greases. <b>Lithium</b> {{hydroxide}} {{is a strong}} base and, when heated with a fat, produces a soap made of <b>lithium</b> stearate. <b>Lithium</b> soap {{has the ability to}} thicken oils, and it is used to manufacture all-purpose, high-temperature lubricating greases.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2011 study {{conducted}} at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California Berkeley, the currently estimated reserve base of <b>lithium</b> {{should not be}} a limiting factor for large-scale battery production for electric vehicles, as the study estimated that on the order of 1 billion 40 kWh Li-based batteries (about 10kg of <b>lithium</b> per car) could be built with current reserves, as estimated by the U.S. Geological Survey. Another 2011 study by researchers from the University of Michigan and Ford Motor Company found that there are sufficient <b>lithium</b> resources to support global demand until 2100, including the <b>lithium</b> required for the potential widespread use of hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric and battery electric vehicles. The study estimated global <b>lithium</b> reserves at 39 million tons, and total demand for <b>lithium</b> during the 90-year period analyzed at 12–20 million tons, depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates.|$|E

5|$|Another {{potential}} source of <b>lithium</b> is the leachates of geothermal wells, which are carried to the surface. Recovery of <b>lithium</b> has been demonstrated in the field; the <b>lithium</b> is separated by simple filtration. The process and environmental costs are primarily those of the already-operating well; net environmental impacts may thus be positive.|$|E
5|$|Another way of {{estimating}} {{the age of}} the cluster is by looking at the lowest-mass objects. In normal main-sequence stars, <b>lithium</b> is rapidly destroyed in nuclear fusion reactions. Brown dwarfs can retain their <b>lithium,</b> however. Due to lithium's very low ignition temperature of 2.5 × 106 K, the highest-mass brown dwarfs will burn it eventually, and so determining the highest mass of brown dwarfs still containing <b>lithium</b> in the cluster can give an idea of its age. Applying this technique to the Pleiades gives an age of about 115 million years.|$|E
5|$|Carriage and {{shipment}} of {{some kinds of}} <b>lithium</b> batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of <b>lithium</b> batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when short-circuited, leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway. Most consumer <b>lithium</b> batteries have built-in thermal overload protection to prevent this type of incident, or are otherwise designed to limit short-circuit currents. Internal shorts from manufacturing defect or physical damage can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen is {{sometimes}} placed above <b>lithium,</b> above carbon, above fluorine, above both <b>lithium</b> and fluorine (appearing twice), or left floating above {{the other elements}} and not assigned to any group in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 20th century, <b>lithium</b> {{became an}} {{important}} component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, {{should not be confused with}} <b>lithium</b> batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with <b>lithium</b> or its compounds as the anode. Other rechargeable batteries that use <b>lithium</b> include the lithium-ion polymer battery, <b>lithium</b> iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.|$|E

5|$|<b>Lithium</b> amides {{like the}} diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) {{generally}} {{work well for}} the deprotonation {{of all types of}} salts, providing that not too much LiOH is present in the n-butyllithium used to make the <b>lithium</b> amide. Titration of <b>lithium</b> amide can be used to determine the amount of hydroxide in solution. The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the deprotonation of all types of salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, where this base can act as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lithium</b> {{is found}} in trace amount in {{numerous}} plants, plankton, and invertebrates, at concentrations of 69 to 5,760 parts per billion (ppb). In vertebrates the concentration is slightly lower, and nearly all vertebrate tissue and body fluids contain <b>lithium</b> ranging from 21 to 763 ppb. Marine organisms tend to bioaccumulate <b>lithium</b> more than terrestrial organisms. Whether <b>lithium</b> has a physiological role {{in any of these}} organisms is unknown.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lithium</b> {{is present}} in {{biological}} systems in trace amounts; its functions are uncertain. <b>Lithium</b> salts {{have proven to be}} useful as a mood-stabilizing drug in the treatment of bipolar disorder in humans.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lithium</b> {{isotopes}} fractionate substantially {{during a}} wide variety of natural processes, including mineral formation (chemical precipitation), metabolism, and ion exchange. <b>Lithium</b> ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals, where 6Li is preferred to 7Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration. The exotic 11Li is known to exhibit a nuclear halo. The process known as laser isotope separation can be used to separate <b>lithium</b> isotopes, in particular 7Li from 6Li.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lithium</b> {{naturally}} only {{occurs in}} traces in biological systems {{and has no}} known biological role, but does have effects on the body when ingested. <b>Lithium</b> carbonate {{is used as a}} mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder (manic-depression) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2grams, although there are side-effects. Excessive ingestion of <b>lithium</b> causes drowsiness, slurred speech and vomiting, among other symptoms, and poisons the central nervous system, which is dangerous as the required dosage of <b>lithium</b> to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage. Its biochemistry, the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element, although the natural biological function of <b>lithium</b> in humans has yet to be identified.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lithium</b> {{production}} has greatly increased {{since the end}} of World War II. The metal is separated from other elements in igneous minerals. The metal is produced through electrolysis from a mixture of fused 55% <b>lithium</b> chloride and 45% potassium chloride at about 450°C.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lithium</b> salts {{have to be}} {{extracted}} from the water of mineral springs, brine pools, and brine deposits. The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused <b>lithium</b> chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lithium</b> {{was first}} {{detected}} in human organs and fetal tissues {{in the late}} 19th century. In humans there are no defined <b>lithium</b> deficiency diseases, but low <b>lithium</b> intakes from water supplies were associated with increased rates of suicides, homicides and the arrest rates for drug use and other crimes. The biochemical mechanisms of action of <b>lithium</b> appear to be multifactorial and are intercorrelated with the functions of several enzymes, hormones and vitamins, {{as well as with}} growth and transforming factors. Evidence now appears to be sufficient to accept <b>lithium</b> as essential; a provisional RDA of 1,000µg/day is suggested for a 70kg adult.|$|E
5|$|Metallic <b>lithium</b> and its complex hydrides, such as Li, {{are used}} as high-energy {{additives}} to rocket propellants. <b>Lithium</b> aluminum hydride {{can also be used}} by itself as a solid fuel.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} <b>lithium</b> {{is composed}} of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (92.5% natural abundance). Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); <b>lithium</b> is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two <b>lithium</b> nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than deuterium and helium-3. As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, <b>lithium</b> is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements. Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6ms. The shortest-lived isotope of <b>lithium</b> is 4Li, which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.6 × 10−23 s.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{half the}} world's known {{reserves}} {{are located in}} Bolivia, {{and according to the}} US Geological Survey, Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni desert has 5.4 million tons of <b>lithium.</b> Other important reserves are located in Chile, China, and Brazil. Since 2006 the Bolivian government have nationalized oil and gas projects and is keeping a tight control over mining its <b>lithium</b> reserves. Already the Japanese and South Korean governments, as well as companies from these two countries and France, have offered technical assistance to develop Bolivia's <b>lithium</b> reserves and are seeking {{to gain access to the}} <b>lithium</b> resources through a mining and industrialization model suitable to Bolivian interests.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear weapons {{manufacture}} and other nuclear physics applications {{are a major}} source of artificial <b>lithium</b> fractionation, with the light isotope 6Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles {{to such an extent that}} it has caused slight but measurable change in the 6Li to 7Li ratios in natural sources, such as rivers. This has led to unusual uncertainty in the standardized atomic weight of <b>lithium,</b> since this quantity depends on the natural abundance ratios of these naturally-occurring stable <b>lithium</b> isotopes, as they are available in commercial <b>lithium</b> mineral sources.|$|E
5|$|Since many {{substrates}} are not stable to sodium hydride, several {{procedures have}} been developed using milder bases. Masamune and Roush have developed mild conditions using <b>lithium</b> chloride and DBU. Rathke extended this to <b>lithium</b> or magnesium halides with triethylamine. Several other bases have been found effective.|$|E
5|$|Some jurisdictions {{limit the}} sale of <b>lithium</b> batteries, which are the most readily {{available}} source of <b>lithium</b> for ordinary consumers. <b>Lithium</b> {{can be used to}} reduce pseudoephedrine and ephedrine to methamphetamine in the Birch reduction method, which employs solutions of alkali metals dissolved in anhydrous ammonia.|$|E
