40|$|An {{analysis}} has been performed of measured and predicted aircraft noise levels around Denver International Airport. A detailed examination {{was made of}} 90 straight-out departures that yielded good measurements on multiple monitors. Predictions were made with INM 5, INM 6 and the simulation model NMSIM. Predictions were consistently lower than measurements, less so for the simulation model than for the integrated models. <b>Lateral</b> <b>directivity</b> ("installation effect") patterns were seen which are consistent with other recent measurements. Atmospheric absorption {{was determined to be}} a significant factor in the underprediction. Calculations of atmospheric attenuation were made over a full year of upper air data at seven locations across the United States. It was found that temperature/humidity effects could cause variations of up to +/- 4 dB, depending on season, for the sites examined. It was concluded that local temperature and humidity should be accounted for in aircraft noise modeling...|$|E
40|$|Opto-acoustic imaging is {{a growing}} field of {{research}} in recent years, providing functional imaging of physiological biomarkers, such as the oxygenation of haemoglobin. Piezo electric transducers are the industry standard detector for ultrasonics, but their limited bandwidth, susceptibility to electromagnetic interference and their inversely proportional sensitivity to size all affect the detector performance. Sensors based on polymer optical fibres (POF) are immune to electromagnetic interference, have lower acoustic impedance and a reduced Young's Modulus compared to silica fibres. Furthermore, POF enables {{the possibility of a}} wideband sensor and a size appropriate to endoscopy. Micro-structured POF (mPOF) used in an interferometric detector {{has been shown to be}} an order of magnitude more sensitive than silica fibre at 1 MHz and 3 times more sensitive at 10 MHz. We present the first opto-acoustic measurements obtained using a 4. 7 mm PMMA mPOF Bragg grating with a fibre diameter of 130 μm and present the <b>lateral</b> <b>directivity</b> pattern of a PMMA mPOF FBG ultrasound sensor over a frequency range of 1 - 50 MHz. We discuss the impact of the pattern with respect to the targeted application and draw conclusions on how to mitigate the problems encountered...|$|E
40|$|The sound {{radiation}} from the intake of unconventional aeroengine intakes was studied computationally. The configuration is characterized as a nacelle which is buried into an aerodynamic surface (fuselage or wing) with various burying levels. The influence of the flow field on the {{sound radiation}} was studied as well. After generating a curvilinear structured 3 D multi-block grid for the given configuration, the precalculated solution of DLR’s CFD finite volume code Tau was interpolated from its unstructured mesh onto the structured one for the acoustic calculations. The simulation of aeroacoustic propagation out of the engine inlet was performed using DLR’s CAA code PIANO (perturbation investigation of aerodynamic noise), which solves the (non) linear Euler perturbation equation. PIANO is a high resolution, high order finite difference code advancing the numerical solution in time by the well known 4 -stage Runge-Kutta scheme. Spatial derivatives are discretized by the dispersion relation preserving (DRP) scheme of C. K. W. Tam et. al. A 4 th-order pade filtering is used to eliminate spurious waves. As a generic source plane waves of 1000 Hz (blade passing frequency) were enforced by a sponge-layer technique to enter the duct from downstream of the given fan face position (i. e. in the unphysical duct extension). For two levels of burying the case without flow served as a reference. The spatial structure of the sound field was evaluated on distinct sections (symmetry, i. e. y = 0, and ground plane, i. e. z = 0) of the three-dimensional computational domain. The directivities in the planes of three circles (perpendicular to each other) were determined by recording the pressure time histories. The influence of different mean flows as well as burying levels was proven. Contrary to the 1 / 2 -buried case the 1 / 3 -buried geometry causes a non-axi-symmetric <b>lateral</b> <b>directivity</b> without flow. It could be demonstrated how an only locally too poor grid resolution {{may result in a}} completely non-physical solution. The actual viscous mean flow plays an important role, especially because of its (even poorly resolved) boundary layers. The results underline the need of using a perturbation approach of LEE type to describe the physics of the sound radiation from a buried intake properly. No self sustained flow oscillations (resonances) were observed in any considered case...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} {{resolution of}} noise directivity patterns from acoustic flight tests was investigated. Directivity angle resolution {{is affected by}} the data reduction parameters, the aircraft velocity and flyover altitude, and by deviations of the aircraft from the desired flight path. Equations are developed which determine bounds for the <b>lateral</b> and longitudinal <b>directivity</b> angle resolution {{as a function of the}} nominal directivity angle. The equations are applied to a flight test data base and the effects of several flight conditions and data reduction parameters on the directivity angle resolution are presented. The maximum directivity angle resolution typically occurs when the aircraft is at or near the overhead position. In general, directivity angle resolution improves with decreasing velocity, increasing altitude, increasing sampling rate, decreasing block size, and decreasing block averages. Deviations from the desired ideal flight path will increase the resolution. For the flight experiment considered in this study, an average of two flyovers were required at each test condition to obtain an acceptable flight path. The ability of the pilot to maintain the flight track improved with decreasing altitude, decreasing velocity, and practice. Due to the prevailing wind conditions, yaw angles of as much as 20 deg were required to maintain the desired flight path...|$|R
