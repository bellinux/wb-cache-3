Because restrictions on {{information flow}} do not necessarily change monotonically over time, this definition requires programmers to invoke downgrading operations. A reactive information flow (RIF) specification for a value v gives (i) allowed uses for v and (ii) the RIF specification for any value that might be directly or indirectly derived from v. RIF specifications thus specify how transforming a value might alter how the result may be used, and that is more expressive than existing approaches for controlling downgrading. We implement a type system for RIF specifications by extending Jif, a dialect of Java that supports a form of classic information flow. By implementing the JRIF language and compiler, we show how a classic information-flow type system can be easily replaced with a more ex-pressive RIF type system. We built example applications with JRIF, and we provide insights into the benefits of RIF-based security labels. ...|$|R

From a theoretical point of view, uncertainty over the demand for a firm’s product may have unclear effects on investments, as it depends on a number of factors (such as the production technology and the degree of competition in the product market). Even assuming risk neutrality, the sign and the intensity of the investment-uncertainty relationship cannot be settled on purely theoretical grounds but need an empirical investigation. The aim {{of this paper is to}} extend the findings of the empirical literature by using a panel of Italian firms over a fairly long period of time (1996 - 2004), covering a complete business cycle. The availability of a panel of survey data about companies’ investment plans, expected future sales and demand uncertainty allows us to account for unobservable individual firm differences and for macroeconomic shocks, and to avoid the use of proxies based on assumptions at <b>least</b> quite <b>restrictive.</b> A key finding from our analysis is the increasing weakness over time of the link between investment plans and uncertainty. In explaining this fact, the results of the paper emphasise the influence on the investment-uncertainty relationship of the increase in the competition faced by Italian firms in the period under scrutiny. If our empirical analyses had been conducted with realised, instead of planned, data about the variables of interest, previous findings at best would have weaken, making evident that data of survey’s questionnaires are a key ingredient for appropriately modelling companies’ behaviour...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to reconcile the}} principle of assimilation with the principle of mutual recognition with respect to third country goods entering the EU. It argues that third country goods in free circulation should benefit from the principle of mutual recognition when imported into other Member States if those goods are marketable {{in any one of}} the Member States. Following the principle of assimilation, such goods should be able to rely on Article 34 TFEU "without distinction" between goods of EU origin and third country origin. Mutual recognition, on the other hand, allows traders to challenge indistinctly applicable product rules if goods are "lawfully produced and marketed in another Member State". This article assesses four different ways of reconciling these two principles. The article argues that the preferred option is to allow goods in free circulation that are "lawfully marketable" in another Member State to benefit from the presumption of equivalence that follows from mutual recognition when those goods are imported into another Member State. This is the <b>least</b> trade <b>restrictive</b> way to achieve the fundamental purpose of mutual recognition: subjecting goods within the EU internal market, as much as possible, to only one set of technical regulations, not two or zero. If goods of third country origin can be marketed in one Member State according its technical rules, those goods should be presumed to meet equivalent standards set by the Member State of importation. The burden of proof should be on the Member State seeking to apply its technical rules to the imported products in question to demonstrate their necessityin light of public interest requirements...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{examination}} of how the restrictiveness of different design regulations impacts the process of new construction in historic areas. The North End, South End, and Back Bay neighborhoods of Boston were identified as historic areas that possessed increasingly restrictive design regulations, and within each neighborhood, two recent new buildings were selected as case studies. Each pair of cases represented a project that had undergone either an easy or difficult approval process under the district's design regulations. Using relevant statutes, interviews with regulators, reviewers, and architects, and the official documentation produced during the approval process, histories {{for each of the}} new buildings were compiled and compared. The results of this comparison suggest that, counter to the hypothesis, there is not a direct relationship between the restrictiveness of the regulation and certain variables such as historicism, inflexibility, and contextualism. In many ways, the new construction processes that occur in the North End and Back Bay, the <b>least</b> and most <b>restrictive</b> regulatory environments, respectively, resemble each other much more than they resemble the process that takes place in the South End, which is moderately restrictive. (cont.) Various factors lead to the prevalence of historicist design in the South End, while there is an unexpectedly high probability that new designs in the North End and Back Bay will depart from traditional historic architectural norms.

While {{it has been}} widely implemented in low prevalence countries, the most optimal protocols for contact investigation in high prevalence, low resource settings {{is yet to be}} determined. This study evaluated contact investigation interventions in eleven lower and middle income countries and reviewed the association between context or program-related factors and the yield of cases among contacts. We reviewed data from nineteen first wave TB REACH funded projects piloting innovations to improve case detection. These nineteen had fulfilled the eligibility criteria: contact investigation implementation and complete data reporting. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the percentage yield and case notifications for each project. Implementation strategies were delineated and the association between independent variables and yield was analyzed by fitting a random effects logistic regression. Overall, the nineteen interventions screened 139, 052 household contacts, showing great heterogeneity in the percentage yield of microscopy confirmed cases (SS+), ranging from 0. 1 % to 6. 2 %). Compared to the most restrictive testing criteria (at least two weeks of cough) the aOR's for lesser (any TB related symptom) and <b>least</b> (all contacts) <b>restrictive</b> testing criteria were 1. 71 (95 %CI 0. 94 - 3. 13) and 6. 90 (95 % CI 3. 42 - 13. 93) respectively.

40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) have received much attention recently as an innovative approach to restoring and protecting valued ocean resources. The acceptability of MPAs in the U. S. will depend, {{to a large}} extent, on society 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions regarding the relevant {{costs and benefits of}} such areas. In order to incorporate social impact information into marine resource management decisions, it is necessary to study the values, beliefs and attitudes of affected stakeholders. The cognitive hierarchy model provides a theoretical framework for understanding relationships among these cognitions. According to this model, value orientations and beliefs can directly influence attitudes toward a particular attitude object. This study utilized the cognitive hierarchy model to investigate relationships among saltwater anglers 2 ̆ 7 value orientations, beliefs and attitudes connected with MPAs. The moderating effects of recreation specialization and MPA knowledge on these relationships were also explored. Data were collected using a mail survey sent to a representative sample of private boat saltwater anglers in the Northeast United States. Attitudes were measured for four types of hypothetical MPAs ranging from <b>least</b> to most <b>restrictive</b> on saltwater anglers. Three value orientations (biocentric/anthropocentric, general marine resource values, and open access/ocean zoning) and three higher order beliefs (health of the oceans, impact of recreational fishing, and long-term effect of recreational catch reductions on fishing quality) were measured. Ocean zoning/open access value orientation and beliefs about the ocean 2 ̆ 7 s health were the best predictors of MPA attitudes. As hypothesized, anglers with ocean zoning value orientations hold more favorable attitudes towards marine {{protected areas}} than do anglers with open access value orientations. Similarly, anglers who believe that the oceans are in poor health hold more favorable attitudes towards marine protected areas than do anglers who believe the oceans are relatively healthy. Recreation specialization and MPA knowledge were not found to have a moderating effect for most cognitive relationships tested. However, for highly specialized anglers, the variable measuring beliefs about the impact of recreational fishing on the marine environment was significantly correlated with attitudes towards the MPA alternative allowing only “catch and release” recreational fishing. Implications of these results for marine resource policy and management are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Republished by University of Adelaide Press, 2012. The Uruguay Round of {{multilateral}} trade negotiations, {{culminating in}} the GATT Secretariat being transformed into the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 1 January 1995, has altered forever the process of quarantine policymaking by national governments. On the one hand, WTO member countries retain the right to protect the life and health of their people, plants and animals from the risks of hazards such as pests and diseases arising from the importation of goods. On the other hand, the WTO’s Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement) requires that quarantine measures be determined {{in a manner that}} is transparent, consistent, scientifically based, and the least trade-restrictive. This collection resulted from an international workshop funded and organised by Biosecurity Australia, the agency of government responsible for analysing Australia's quarantine import risks and for negotiating multilateral SPS rules and less restrictive access to overseas markets for Australian produce. The workshop, which was held at the Melbourne Business School on 24 - 25 October 2000, brought together a distinguished group of applied economists and quarantine policy analysts whose focus involves regions as disparate as Europe, North America, Africa, Asia and New Zealand, in addition to Australia. 1.
