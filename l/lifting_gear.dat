5|$|The guns {{mounted in}} the open battery were lighter {{than those in the}} casemates and were not {{enclosed}} but traversed on rails in the open air. A covered section between each emplacement led to an ammunition lift shaft up which the shells and cartridges were raised using <b>lifting</b> <b>gear</b> that still survives.|$|E
5|$|Within {{three hours}} of the {{derailment}} {{the site of the}} accident had been sealed off with a five-mile cordon. The line was expected to be closed for two weeks, with Virgin Trains saying that the line would not reopen to passenger services until 12 March 2007. The recovery operation was slowed by problems in getting heavy <b>lifting</b> <b>gear</b> to the site which required temporary roads to be constructed.|$|E
5|$|The magazines, {{situated}} deep {{under the}} casemates, consist of alternating pairs of shell and cartridge rooms accessed via an ammunition passage {{at the front}} and a lighting passage behind. Great care was taken to reduce {{the possibility of an}} accidental explosion. The magazine workers wore special clothes and shoes to eliminate the risk of striking sparks and the floors of the cartridge stores were covered by wooden battens. The lighting was provided from oil lamps situated behind glass windows and accessed only from the lighting passage, which was physically separated {{from the rest of the}} magazine. Sets of <b>lifting</b> <b>gear</b> enabled the workers to winch the cartridges and ammunition up to the casemates, with which they could communicate via voice tubes.|$|E
50|$|Container cranes, {{and heavy}} <b>lift</b> <b>gear</b> were installed. Room for two large freighters was created, {{both in terms}} of length and draught. Over the years, the cranes have been expanded, the latter set was built in China, and quadruple stack containering allowed.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} located at the {{junction}} of Randolph Avenue and Elgin Avenue and has a surface building designed by Underground Electric Railways Company of London's architect Stanley Heaps. He used a standardized design that appears in many station buildings under control of UERL whilst Maida Vale was provided with buildings {{in the style of the}} earlier Leslie Green stations but without the upper storey, which was no longer required for housing <b>lift</b> <b>gear.</b> It was one of the first London Underground stations built specifically to use escalators rather than lifts.|$|R

25|$|Unbalanced {{attachment}} of <b>lifting</b> <b>gear</b> {{may cause}} the load to be unstable once lifted {{free of the}} bottom. subsequent capsize or shifting of the load may break it free of the rigging, or damage the load or the lift bag. Similarly poorly chosen or inadequate lifting points may result in overstressing the cargo and causing damage.|$|E
25|$|The lift is {{controlled}} by {{a line from the}} surface vessel, and the load is reduced by a lift bag with a volume too small to support the weight of the load when full. This allows a faster lift by the winch. The <b>lifting</b> <b>gear</b> must be capable of supporting the load if the bag fails, or must be arranged to fail safely.|$|E
25|$|Lift {{bags are}} used to bring the load up in stages: a long chain or sling is used to connect the load to a lift bag just below the surface, which is filled to break out the load and lift it until the bag reaches the surface, then a second bag is used to bring the load up further. This {{procedure}} continues until the load has been raised sufficiently. Advantages of this method are a more controlled lift, the facility to use a larger capacity for initial breakout without risk of a runaway. Disadvantages include the requirement for divers to work {{on or near the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>gear</b> when under load.|$|E
5|$|Progress on {{the section}} from Paddington to Queen's Park was slowed by {{the start of}} World War I, so the line was not {{finished}} until early 1915. As at Paddington, the three below-ground stations were built to use escalators. Maida Vale and Kilburn Park were provided with buildings {{in the style of the}} earlier Leslie Green stations but without the upper storey, which was no longer required for housing <b>lift</b> <b>gear.</b> Warwick Avenue was accessed from a subway under the street. The LNWR rebuilt Queen's Park station with additional platforms for the Bakerloo Tube's and its own electric services and constructed two train sheds for rolling stock, one each side of the station.|$|R

Introduced in 1991, the Classic 4 has stronger <b>lift</b> struts, <b>gear</b> legs, and fuselage carry-through tubes, which allow a gross weight of 1200 lb. The vertical stabilizer and rudder height was increased by 10 in, and the rudder width was increased by 2 in.|$|R
500|$|Van Gogh used varying {{techniques}} when {{he created}} the painting, depending upon the subject and {{what he wanted to}} convey. [...] The grass and the path in the foreground were painted rapidly. [...] The bridge, though, was painted in greater detail, with clearly defined stone piers and wooden beams.

50|$|To {{negotiate}} sharp curves, {{both the}} first and fifth pairs of coupled wheels were flangeless. The cylinders were arranged outside the plate frame, while the Richardson balanced type slide valves were placed between the frames. The locomotive used saturated steam and was equipped with Allan straight link valve gear, which was reversed by hand-wheel and quick screw gear. Allan valve gear was chosen chiefly because it required less space than the more usual Stephenson <b>lifting</b> link <b>gear</b> and was simpler in construction. The trailing Bissel truck was of the Cartazzi type which allowed the axle some lateral movement.|$|R
5000|$|Until 2010 this {{engine was}} a dual {{overhead}} cam design with one cam actuating the injectors {{and the other}} the valve train. This injection system is known as HPI (high pressure injection) where the injectors are cam-actuated to create injection pressure. The fuel system uses an Integrated Fuel System Module (IFSM) with a <b>lift</b> pump, <b>gear</b> pump, pressure regulators, shutoff valve, metering and timing actuators to deliver fuel to the injectors. It has a one piece valve cover that is either plastic or on older models a chrome plated steel cover otherwise known as the Signature 600 or ISX CM570.|$|R

[...] After locating the wreckage on the sea floor on 17 September at [...] in about 1,100 feet of water one of British Voyagers submersibles performed a video survey and located the bodies of two of the missing aircrew. Due to the water depth, the impact damage to the airframe, and a prolonged period of dangerous weather, it was not until 10 October that the semi-submersible lifting vessel Uncle John was able to retrieve the wreckage for analysis.|$|E

2500|$|The Aleksandr Pushkin was {{constructed}} at VEB Mathias-Thesen Werft in Wismar, East Germany. She {{was the second}} ship of the [...] (also referred to as [...] "poet" [...] or [...] "writer" [...] class), named after the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. The construction of this class featured some notable differences from contemporary ships built in the west. Amongst other things they offered cabins for six people and had three taps in the bathrooms - for hot, cold and sea water - Both of these features had long since been abandoned in western liners. The ships also featured certain forward-looking features, such as all outside accommodation for both passengers and the crew, and an indoor/outdoor swimming pool with a sliding glass roof. To enable the ships to navigate through broken ice, they were constructed with greater hull strength and stability than usual in passenger ships of this size. The Ivan Franko-class ships were also built with the use as a troopship in mind. Due to this they had unusually large provision and storage areas, enabling a cruising range of over [...] As a more visible sign of potential military use, the ships were equipped with unusually powerful deck <b>lifting</b> <b>gear,</b> apparently {{to be able to}} transport armoured vehicles on board. As built, the ship carried between 650-766 passengers in two classes, with different sources providing different figures. Additionally there were provisions for 500 cabinless passengers.|$|E
