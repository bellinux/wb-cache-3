40|$|The {{development}} {{and performance of}} single- and multiple-wavelength <b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensor</b> systems {{for use in the}} remote detection and quantification of algae are discussed. The appropriate equation for the fluorescence power received by a <b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensor</b> system is derived in detail. Experimental development of a single wavelength system and a four wavelength system, which selectively excites the algae contained in the four primary algal color groups, is reviewed, and test results are presented. A comprehensive error analysis is reported which evaluates the uncertainty in the remote determination of the chlorophyll a concentration contained in algae by single- and multiple-wavelength <b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensor</b> systems. Results of the error analysis indicate that the remote quantification of chlorophyll a by a <b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensor</b> system requires optimum excitation wavelength(s), remote measurement of marine attenuation coefficients, and supplemental instrumentation to reduce uncertainties in the algal fluorescence cross sections...|$|E
40|$|Airborne lidar {{systems have}} {{frequently}} {{been used to}} measure hydrographic parameters under va-rious conditions {{during the past two}} decades. Since 1993, a Do 228 - 212 aircraft, equipped with a <b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensor</b> for detailed analysis of oil spills, has been used for maritime surveillance of the German territory in the North and Baltic Seas. This operational task offers the possibility to monitor hydrographic parameters. In this paper, the power of operational hydrographic measurements with an airborne <b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensor</b> is investigated. Essential features of the recently developed concept of automated distribution among different participants of a monitoring programme will be presen-ted, especially the graphical user interface developed for easy access and evaluation of hydro-graphic <b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensor</b> data. Recent results from the winter and spring periods of 1999 / 2000 will be presented. Prominent features are the distribution of gelbstoff related to water masses and the onset of phytoplankton bloom in the German Bight and the western Baltic Sea.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an event-driven and scalable oil spill monitoring and management system. The system provides functions for managing oil spill information. The system differs from the traditional web-based request/response interaction model. Specifically, advantages of an event-driven system are its abilities to automatically match events with the subscriptions from the clients and push the event information to related clients in real-time when events occur. The event-driven system is also scalable: this means that it can easily be extended to include new functions or to integrate new information services. The system’s middleware spatially processes the rules and algorithms for events and supports real-time data transaction from heterogeneous sources. GISbased analytical information processing modules generate the oil spill monitoring and management output products. <b>Laser</b> <b>fluorosensors</b> are incorporated in order to enhance oil spill detection and surveillance.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{differentiate}} classes of oil-spills on water surface, a neural network (NN) approach is applied for spectral data analysis and identification of airborne <b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensor</b> in this paper. The target to be detected {{may be one}} of the following: seawater, lube, diesel, etc. The primary requirement for airborne sensors is to identify the substances targeted by the laser beam. Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) method is one of the most current approaches. This paper outlines the NN model for the identification of the spilled oils, and makes a comparison with PCC in an effort to increase the level of confidence in the identification results. The results of ground tests using known targets show an increased confidence in the results when using the NN Model compared to that of PCC. It is believed that the NN model would play a significant role in the ocean oil-spill identification in the future. © Springer-Verlag 2004. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{artificial}} neural network (ANN) approach, {{which is based on}} flexible nonlinear models for a very broad class of transfer functions, is applied for multi-spectral data analysis and modeling of airborne <b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensor</b> in order to differentiate between classes of oil on water surface. We use three types of algorithm: Perceptron Network, Back-Propagation (B-P) Network and Self-Organizing feature Maps (SOM) Network. Using the data in form of 64 -channel spectra as inputs, the ANN presents the analysis and estimation results of the oil type {{on the basis of the}} type of background materials as outputs. The ANN is trained and tested using sample data set to the network. The results of the above 3 types of network are compared in this paper. It is proved that the training has developed a network that not only fits the training data, but also fits real-world data that the network will process operationally.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{reports on}} oil {{classification}} with fluorescence spectroscopy. The investigations {{are part of}} the development of a laser-based remote sensor (<b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensor)</b> to be used for the detection and classification of oil spills on water surfaces. The polychromator of the fluorosensor has six channels for measuring signals that represent the fluorescence spectral signature of the detected oil in the UV/VIS wavelength range following excitation at 355 nm. The investigation of the oil classification is based on the shape of the signature of the oil detected by these channels. The investigation uses three methods to examine crude oils, heavy refined oils, and sludge oils: the channels relationships method (CRM); artificial neural networks (ANN); and support vector machines (SVM). This was done based on a laboratory database of oil fluorescence spectra. The database and the input fluorescence signature of the oils play a very important role in the efficiency of the classification method.

40|$|The {{regional}} {{assessment of}} hydrocarbon seepage {{is built around}} a combination of Radarsat and ERS Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, acquired during 1998 and 1999, {{as part of a}} collaborative project between Geoscience Australia, Nigel Press Associates, Radarsat International and AUSLIG (specifically the Australian Centre for Remote Sensing). In total, 55 Radarsat Wide 1 Beam Mode scenes and one ERS scene from the Great Australian Bight (GAB) region were analysed. The data were integrated with regional geological information, and other hydrocarbon migration and seepage indicators such as reprocessed and reinterpreted legacy Airborne <b>Laser</b> <b>Fluorosensor</b> (ALF) data, to provide an assessment of the possible charge characteristics of the region. The results of the study suggest that active, though areally restricted, liquid hydrocarbon seepage is occurring within the Bight Basin. The majority of seepage slicks occur along the outer margin of the major depocentre, the Ceduna Sub-basin, in areas where significant Late Tertiary to Recent faulting extends to the seafloor. Very little evidence of seepage was observed on the SAR data above the main depocentre, which is an area of minimal Late Tertiary to Recent faulting. Reprocessed ALF data reveal three main areas with relatively dense fluors. Although they are not directly coincident with locations of seepage interpreted from SAR data, their distribution support the pattern of preferred leakage along the basin margins. Integration of regional geological models with {{the results of this study}} suggests that structural features related to active tectonism have focused laterally migrating hydrocarbons to produce active seepage at specific locations in the basin. Where these features are absent, seepage may be passive andlor be governed by long distance migration to points of seal failure. Together with oil and gas shows in exploration wells, observations from this study provide further evidence that liquid hydrocarbons have been generated in the Great Australian Bight...|$|E
