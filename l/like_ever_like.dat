500|$|... "How Will I Know" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American recording artist Whitney Houston for her eponymous debut album, which was released in February 1985. The song was released by Arista Records in November that year, as the album's third single. Composed by George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam, the song was originally intended for Janet Jackson, but she passed on it. Houston then recorded the song with altered lyrics and production from Narada Michael Walden. The lyrics speak about the protagonist trying to discern if a boy she <b>likes</b> will <b>ever</b> <b>like</b> her back.|$|R

"You {{fire up the}} app on the iPhone or {{web browser}} and say a person, place or thing is “the best” or “the worst” <b>ever,</b> <b>like</b> like, the Best Dubstep track ever...You can agree with this {{statement}} with an “Amen”.

500|$|... "How Will I Know" [...] is {{composed}} in a 1980s dance beat. Rolling Stone described the song as [...] "perky synth-funk". According to Kyle Anderson of MTV, the song found Houston hitting an [...] "incredible groove". It {{is written in}} the key of G flat major. The beat is set the time signature of common time and moves at a fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. The song also has the sequence of G-Bm7-G/C-D-Em-D as its chord progression. Houston's vocals in the song span from the note of E4 to the high note of G5. Lyrically, the song speaks about the protagonist trying to discern whether a boy she <b>likes</b> will <b>ever</b> <b>like</b> her back. She is also hesitant, because her friends tell her [...] "love can be deceiving", and she is so shy that she cannot phone him. Later, she feels {{that it might be}} a dream, but realizes that [...] "there's no mistaking", and that what she feels is really love.|$|R
