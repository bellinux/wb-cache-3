40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show that <b>laser</b> treated magnesium-based <b>alloys</b> can be a {{potential}} candidate for biodegradable implants. Magnesium alloys are biocompatible, lightweight and have good mechanical properties. The poor corrosion resistance of magnesium-based alloys can be advantageously used as biodegradable implants. However, the key issue is that, magnesium corrosion is too high in the physiological system which deteriorates the mechanical integrity of the alloy very rapidly. This study explores the possibility of enhancing the corrosion resistance of magnesium alloy (AZ 31) through laser treatment, which has an advantage of unaltering the bulk chemical composition and thus the mechanical property is not compromised.
