25|$|The {{ship that}} truly {{launched}} {{the first phase}} of the Portuguese discoveries along the African coast was the caravel, a development based on existing fishing boats. They were agile and easier to navigate, with a tonnage of 50 to 160 tons and 1 to 3 masts, with lateen triangular sails allowing <b>luffing.</b> The caravel benefited from a greater capacity to tack. The limited capacity for cargo and crew were their main drawbacks, but have not hindered its success. Among the famous caravels are Berrio and Anunciação.|$|E
25|$|In larger {{operations}} such as Jubilee, Torch, Husky, and Overlord, LCAs {{were carried}} to invasion areas by Landing Ship Infantry (LSI). The location {{chosen for the}} LSI to stop and lower the LCA was a designated point inside the 'Transport Area' when the LSI was operating with a US Navy Task Force, or the 'Lowering Position' when with a Royal Navy Task Force. The transport area or lowering position was approximately 6–11 miles off shore (11 miles was amphibious doctrine for the USN by mid-war, while the RN tended to accept {{the risks associated with}} drawing nearer shore). Normally landing ships were fitted with heavy-duty power-operated davits. Early landing ships were fitted with Welin-McLachlin davits – these being generally in use in the Merchant Navy for standard 99 man lifeboats. As the weight of LCAs increased through the war (eventually approaching 14 tons) heavier davits were required. Later LSIs and those being refitted were provisioned with <b>luffing</b> davits of a crossbeam type. The davits themselves provided a demarcation between the responsibilities of the LSI crew (either Royal Navy or Merchant Navy) {{and the members of the}} LCA Flotilla.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the work}} at {{basement}} level at Phase 4, Bachy Soletanche used two [...] support cranes and two Bauer BG 22 piling rigs. Construction of Phase 3 is being assisted by three tower cranes. The first crane to be assembled, TC3, {{is to be the}} shortest of the three tower cranes. It has a maximum height of [...] and has a <b>luffing</b> jib. It was built in one stage. It is a free standing crane and will allow podium level construction. Once construction at podium level is completed, it will be dismantled and replaced by two number gantry joists.|$|E

In 2013, he completed a master's degree in The Study of Religions at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS). He married Carolyn <b>Luff</b> in 1969 and has four children - Ben <b>Luff,</b> Tom <b>Luff,</b> David <b>Luff</b> and Becky <b>Luff.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Luff</b> - The forward (leading) {{edge of a}} {{fore-and-aft sail}} is called the <b>luff,</b> which, in a mainsail, is {{parallel}} to the mast. In a symmetrical sail that leech, which is the leading edge into the wind, may be called the <b>luff.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 16 September 2012, <b>Luff</b> won {{his first}} ever V8 Supercars race, teaming up with Vodafone's Craig Lowndes at the Sandown 500. On 7 October 2012, <b>Luff</b> and Lowndes {{finished}} 3rd in the Supercheap Bathurst 1000, the 50th running of the event, where their car ran special Peter Brock livery to commemorate the history of Bathurst, and Lowndes' mentor. In 2013, again with Lowndes, <b>Luff</b> won the inaugural Enduro Cup. For 2014 <b>Luff</b> teamed up with Garth Tander to contest the 2014 Pirtek Enduro Cup for the Holden Racing Team. Tander and <b>Luff</b> joined forces again in 2015, and despite not winning a race, won the 2015 Enduro Cup, resulting in <b>Luff</b> becoming the first driver to win the award twice.|$|R
2500|$|The second tallest crane, TC2, was {{initially}} assembled to [...] under the hook. This {{will allow the}} hotel tower to be constructed to level 12. It will then be extended in height to [...] under the hook with a tie to the hotel tower at [...] (level 11). This will allow the hotel tower to be constructed to full height. The tallest of the cranes, TC1, {{was expected to be}} initially be built to [...] under the hook and to allow the residential tower to be built to level 14. However, it was constructed to a lower height. It will be extended to [...] with a tie to the residential tower at [...] up. This will allow the residential tower to be built to level 26. After this, it will be extended up to [...] with an additional tie to the tower at [...] (level 21). This will allow the tower to be built up to level 36. It will be extended again once more to [...] with a third tie [...] up (level 31), which will allow the tower to go to full height. It is expected that TC1 and TC2 will be dismantled at around the same time. TC3 and TC2 are Wolff 180B <b>luffing</b> jib tower cranes whilst TC1 has a fixed jib.|$|E
6000|$|By {{this time}} the [...] "Caroline" [...] had swept by, and she was now <b>luffing,</b> across the slaver's bows, into her course again. The figure on the {{taffrail}} waved high the sea-cap in adieu, and disappeared.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's <b>luffing</b> {{with the}} sea on her quarter," [...] said Harry. [...] "I must {{get back to the}} helm, but we'll wait a moment and look around first. Lower your lantern. There's {{something}} on the floor--no, I don't mean the pistol, though you can pick that up." ...|$|E
50|$|A jackline {{is also a}} rope {{installed}} in the <b>luff</b> of a mainsail to allow the <b>luff</b> slides to migrate horizontally away from the mast when the sail is reefed. By allowing the slides to migrate, more space is left in the mast track for the upper <b>luff</b> slides to descend, making the operation easier.|$|R

60|$|It {{was not a}} mere boat, not a mere canoe, but a sailing machine. And the man in it sailed it by {{his weight}} and his nerve--principally by the latter. I watched the canoe beat up from leeward and run in toward the village, its sole {{occupant}} far out on the outrigger and <b>luffing</b> up and spilling {{the wind in the}} puffs.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a collier," [...] Griffith said, [...] "who has hauled {{from the}} land in the late gale, and who is <b>luffing</b> up to his course again. If the wind holds here in the south, {{and he does not}} get into that fog-bank, we can stand off for him and get a supply of fuel before eight bells are struck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, Guinea is {{like the}} launch {{of one of the}} coasters, always towing in your wake, master Harry; whereas I am often <b>luffing</b> athwart your hawse, or getting foul, in some fashion or other, on one of your quarters. Howsomever, we are both shipped, as you see, in this here cruise, with the {{particulars}} of which we are both well satisfied. So pass the word among us, {{what is to be done}} next, and no more parley." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{we got on}} deck, we saw {{the mate}} {{standing}} on the bowsprit, and crying out <b>Luff!</b> <b>Luff!</b> to some one in the dark water before the ship. In that direction, we could just see a light, and then, the great black hull of a strange vessel, that was coming down on us obliquely; and so near, that we heard the flap of her topsails as they shook in the wind, the trampling of feet on the deck, and the same cry of <b>Luff!</b> <b>Luff!</b> that our own mate, was raising.|$|R
50|$|The Beer Luggers, which {{normally}} have the tack of the sail set {{to a small}} bowsprit where untacking it is difficult, will have the lazy sheet forward of the <b>luff</b> of the sail and will use it haul the whole sail around its own <b>luff,</b> leaving the old working but now lazy sheet again forwards around the <b>luff</b> of the sail.|$|R

60|$|Here {{the gentlemen}} waved {{their hands in}} adieu as usual, and la Victoire, clipped as she was of her wings, drew slowly past. The Druid succeeded, and Sir Gervaise simply gave Blewet his orders to see the prize into port, and to look after his own foremast. This ended the field day; the frigate <b>luffing</b> up to {{windward}} of the line again, leaving the Plantagenet in its rear. A few minutes later, the latter ship filled and stood after her consorts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, sir; we are {{friendly}} enough at odd times, though a breeze often springs up between us. Guinea has a d--d awkward fashion of <b>luffing</b> {{up in his}} talk; and your Honour knows it isn't always comfortable to a white man to be driven to leeward by a black. I tell him it is inconvenient. He is a good enough fellow in the main, howsomever, sir; and, as he is just an African bred and born, I hope you'll {{be good enough to}} overlook his little failings." ...|$|E
60|$|The Molly Swash kept {{close on}} a wind, <b>luffing</b> athwar the broad reach she was in, until far enough to weather Blackwell's, when she edged off to her course, {{and went through the}} {{southern}} passage. Although the wind remained light, and a little baffling, the brig was so easily impelled, and was so very handy, that there was no difficulty in keeping her perfectly in command. The tide, too, was fast increasing in strength and volocity, and the movement from this cause alone was getting to be sufficiently rapid.|$|E
5000|$|Alfred <b>Luff</b> (5 April 1846 [...] - [...] 24 February 1933) was an English cricketer. <b>Luff</b> was a {{right-handed}} batsman who bowled right-arm roundarm fast. He {{was born}} at Kew, Surrey.|$|R
5000|$|Warren <b>Luff</b> left Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport, {{citing the}} team's {{uncertain}} future and unstable management as {{his reasons for}} leaving. The team later acquired an ex-Triple Eight Commodore from Paul Morris Motorsports. <b>Luff</b> was replaced by Taz Douglas.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sou'-sou'-east-and-by-east!" [...] {{repeated}} Mr Rokens, in {{a savage}} growl of authority, {{as if he}} were nothing less than the admiral of the Channel Fleet. [...] "That's two points and a half off yer course, sir. <b>Luff,</b> <b>luff,</b> you--you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, your honour, that he is--that is {{just one}} of Sir Jarvy's weak p'ints, as a body might say. Now, I never goes ashore, without {{trimming}} sharp up, and <b>luffing</b> athwart every person's hawse, I fall in with; which is as much as to tell 'em, I belongs to a flag-ship, and a racer, and a craft as hasn't her equal on salt-water; no disparagement to the bit of bunting at the mizzen-topgallant-mast-head of the Cæsar, or to the ship that carries it. I hopes, as we are so well acquainted, Admiral Bluewater, no offence will be taken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{say that}} I'm wanting in natural feeling, your Ladyship," [...] {{returned}} Fid, endeavouring to manifest his admiration of the sex, by the awkward bow {{he made to}} the governess as its representative, [...] "tho'f crosses and mishaps have come athwart me as well as better men. I thought as strong a splice was laid, between me and Kate Whiffle, as was ever turned into a sheet-cable; but then came the law, with its regulations and shipping articles, <b>luffing</b> short athwart my happiness, and making a wreck at once of all the poor girl's hopes, and a Flemish account of my comfort." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{they came}} out, the heavy flap of canvas, quite near, startled their ears, and both turned instinctively to look ahead. There, indeed, was a vessel, {{standing}} directly in, threatening even to cross their very track. She was {{close on a}} wind, with her larboard tacks aboard, and had evidently just shaken everything, in the expectation of <b>luffing</b> past the point without tacking. Could she succeed in this, {{it would be in}} her power to stand on, until compelled to go about beneath the very cliffs of the town of Sorrento. This was, in truth, her aim; for again she shook all her sails.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, and a most partic'lar fine officer he is, {{as every}} body says. Well, sir, he's with the ladies; while his namesake {{has gone back}} to the table, and has put <b>luff</b> upon <b>luff,</b> to fetch up leeway." ...|$|R
50|$|Bermuda mainsails {{may have}} slides {{attached}} to the <b>luff</b> that match tracks on the mast and boom. These may be {{attached to the}} <b>luff</b> through grommets with webbing or a nylon shackle or with webbing sewn directly on the sail.|$|R
50|$|The code 0 {{asymmetric}} is a tight reaching sail, {{the most}} upwind capable of the asymmetrics. The <b>luff</b> is {{as straight as}} possible, and the sail is flatter than other spinnakers. Due to the flatness of the code 0, it is usually made with a wire <b>luff</b> for strength, and of a heavier, less stretchy fabric than normal for a spinnaker. Due to the tight <b>luff</b> and flat cut, the code 0 can be fitted for roller furling.|$|R
60|$|Our guns had {{all been}} primed, levelled, and had their tompions taken out the night before, in {{readiness}} to repel any assault that might be made. I had only to remove the apron from the after-gun, and it {{was ready to be}} discharged. Going to the wheel, I put the helm hard up, until our broadside bore on the canoes. Then glancing along my gun, until I saw it had a tolerable range, I clapped the segar to the priming, springing back to the wheel, and putting the helm down. The explosion produced a general yell among the savages, several of whom actually leaped into the chains ready to go overboard, while Smudge rushed towards me, fiercely brandishing his knife. I thought my time had come! but, perceiving that the ship was <b>luffing</b> fast, I motioned eagerly forward, to draw the attention of my assailant in that quarter. The vessel was coming-to, and Smudge was easily induced to believe it was the commencement of turning round. The breathing time allowed me to mystify him with a few more signs; after which, he rejoined his people, showed them exultingly the ship still <b>luffing,</b> and I make no doubt, he thought himself, and induced the rest to think, that the gun had a material agency in producing all these apparent changes. As for the canoes, the grape had whistled so near them, that they began to paddle back, doubtless under the impression, that we were again masters of the ship, and had sent them this hint to keep aloof.|$|E
60|$|The moon {{had not yet}} risen, and Ruth, {{gazing into}} the starry vault {{of the sky and}} exchanging no speech with Martin, {{experienced}} a sudden feeling of loneliness. She glanced at him. A puff of wind was heeling the boat over till the deck was awash, and he, one hand on tiller and the other on main-sheet, was <b>luffing</b> slightly, at the same time peering ahead to make out the near-lying north shore. He was unaware of her gaze, and she watched him intently, speculating fancifully about the strange warp of soul that led him, a young man with signal powers, to fritter away his time on the writing of stories and poems foredoomed to mediocrity and failure.|$|E
60|$|Both lads {{ran into}} the cockpit. They were {{on the edge of}} the {{breaking}} bar. A huge forty-footer reared a foam-crested head far above them, stealing their wind for the moment and threatening to crush the tiny craft like an egg-shell. Joe held his breath. It was the supreme moment. French Pete luffed straight into it, and the Dazzler mounted the steep slope with a rush, poised a moment on the giddy summit, and fell into the yawning valley beyond. Keeping off in the intervals to fill the mainsail, and <b>luffing</b> into the combers, they worked their way across the dangerous stretch. Once they caught the tail-end of a whitecap and were well-nigh smothered in the froth, but otherwise the sloop bobbed and ducked with the happy facility of a cork.|$|E
