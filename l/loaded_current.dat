40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an innovative cement-electrolyte battery for low power operations such as cathodic protection of reinforced concrete. A battery design was refined by altering different constituents and examining the open circuit voltage, resistor <b>loaded</b> <b>current</b> and lifespan. The final design consisted of a copper plate cathode, aluminium plate anode, and a cement electrolyte which included additives of carbon black, plasticiser, Alum salt and Epsom salt. A relationship between age, temperature and hydration of the cell and the current it produced was determined. It was found that sealing the battery using varnish increased the moisture retention and current output. Current was also found to increase with internal temperature of the electrolyte and connecting two cells in parallel further doubled or even tripled the current. Parallel-connected cells could sustain an average current of 0. 35 mA through a 10 Ω resistor over two weeks of recording. The preliminary findings demonstrate that cement-based batteries can produce sufficient sustainable electrical outputs with the correct materials and arrangement of components. Work is ongoing to determine how these batteries can be recharged using photovoltaics which will further enhance their sustainability properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrical}} circuit of the HERA p-ring is divided in octants whereby {{in the case}} of a quench the current has to be commutated to dumping resistors. A straightforward method would be to use a conventional switching device and stationary <b>loaded</b> <b>current</b> feedthroughs. This approach results in a notable helium consumption of at least 150 L/hr due to the continuous energy loss in the large number of high current leads. An alternative is to apply superconducting switches which enables to keep the main circuit at 4 K while during a quench the current is forced to flow through instantaneously loaded leads and the dumping resistors. The main specifications of the required switches are: current of 6. 5 kA, minimum off-resistarice 12 R, energy absorbed 1 MJ and self protecting. In this paper the various design and feasibility aspects df superconducting switches for this application are discussed. It appeared that the requirement of being passively protected against a self-quench is the most critical one.

40|$|A {{low power}} {{low-dropout}} (LDO) voltage regulator with self-reduction quiescent current is proposed in this paper. This proposed capacitorless LDO for Silicon-on-Chip (SoC) application {{has introduced a}} self-adjustable low-impedance circuitry at the output of LDO to attain stability critically during low output <b>load</b> <b>current</b> (less than a few hundred of micro-ampere). When the LDO <b>load</b> <b>current</b> increases, it reduces the LDO output impedance and moved the pole towards higher frequency away from the dominant pole and improving the system stability. When this happen, less amount of quiescent current is needed for the low-impedance circuitry to sustain the low output impedance. In this proposed LDO, the quiescent current that been used to sustain the low output impedance will be self-reduced when the output <b>load</b> <b>current</b> increases. Thus, the reduction of quiescent current at low output <b>load</b> <b>current</b> has tremendously improved the efficiency.

40|$|Abstract — Shunt active {{filters are}} {{a means to}} improve power quality in {{distribution}} networks. Typically, they are connected in parallel to disturbing loads {{in order to reduce}} the injection of non sinusoidal <b>load</b> <b>currents</b> into the utility grid. The high power active filter investigated in this paper is based on a PWM controlled voltage source inverter. Its inner current control is realized with a dead-beat controller that allows fast tracking of stochastically fluctuating <b>load</b> <b>currents.</b> For the mitigation of stationary <b>load</b> <b>current</b> harmonics, an outer control loop is required that compensates for the persistant phase error caused by the delay of the inner loop. The outer loop developed in this paper is based on integrating oscillators tuned to the major <b>load</b> <b>current</b> harmonics. Mathematically, they are equivalent to I-controllers in rotating reference frames. Some of these oscillators are located within a closed control loop. For frequencies where the feedback would excite grid reso-nances they are placed in a prefilter with phase shifting elements. Since all oscillators share a common feedback full selectivity of the harmonic analysis is achieved. For every harmonic the degree of compensation can be ad-justed individually. In addition to the oscillators, a direct path is provided that feeds forward the <b>load</b> <b>current</b> to the inner control loop. Thus, <b>load</b> <b>current</b> transients can be tracked with the full speed of the dead-beat controller. The direct path does not affect the harmonic analysis performed by the oscillators I...|$|R

In the regression analysis the temperature and <b>load</b> <b>current</b> of the cable circuit are used as independent variables and the pressure within cables is the dependent variable to be predicted.

In LDR design, frequency response {{is the most important}} issue in the regulator performance. With conventional LDR, the bandwidth varies with <b>load</b> <b>current.</b> Thus, the regulator cannot satisfy the speed specification for wide <b>load</b> <b>current</b> range. Besides, due to the compensation characteristics, this design is unreliable and imprecise for high performance application. In this thesis, a new pole-zero tracking frequency compensation is proposed. A tracking zero is generated to cancel out the <b>load</b> <b>current</b> dependent pole. A low frequency dominant pole is also introduced to boost up the DC gain. With this compensation scheme, the frequency response becomes <b>load</b> <b>current</b> independent and the performance can be optimized for wide <b>load</b> <b>current</b> range. The precision is much higher due to the large DC loop gain. Reliability is ensured since the compensation only depends on well-controlled parameters and the ratio of the same component.
