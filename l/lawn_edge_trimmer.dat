50|$|Purpose {{designed}} lawn edgers {{are single}} purpose machines for longer <b>lawn</b> <b>edging</b> distances.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lawn</b> <b>edging</b> with {{a string}} trimmer will often be done with a blade fitted to the head rather than chord.|$|R
50|$|Some designs {{allow the}} angle {{at which the}} cutting chord or blade or blades strike the <b>lawn</b> <b>edge</b> to be adjusted.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, dual-plate {{monopole}} antennas {{without and}} with a shorting pin and/or <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> have been studied. The experimental results of return loss have been presented, and compared with single plate monopole antennas. It {{has been shown that}} the lower end matching frequency can be lowered by 17 % by using dual plates. The higher end matching frequency can be improved by <b>edge</b> <b>trimming.</b> Despite their frequency-dependent radiation patterns, these planar monopoles with a BWR of 1 : 7 or above can serve as a wideband antenna for a range of portable wireless terminals...|$|R
50|$|A GRP roof is a single-ply GRP {{laminate}} {{applied in}} situ over a good quality conditioned plywood or OSB deck. The roof is finished with pre-formed GRP <b>edge</b> <b>trims</b> and {{a coat of}} pre-pigmented topcoat.|$|R
50|$|Some string {{trimmers}} {{are designed}} {{so that they can}} be easily maneuvered with their head being positioned vertically instead of the default horizontal. Other string trimmers come with specific <b>lawn</b> <b>edging</b> attachments, or the one head can be pivoted to be realigned vertically.|$|R
5000|$|Snow-on-the-mountain has grey-green leaves along {{branches}} and smaller leaves (bracts or cyathophylls) in terminal whorls with <b>edges</b> <b>trimmed</b> with wide white bands, creating, {{together with the}} white flowers, the appearance that gives the plant its common names.|$|R
5000|$|A homburg is {{a formal}} felt hat {{characterized}} by a single dent running {{down the center of}} the crown (called a [...] "gutter crown"), a stiff brim shaped in a [...] "kettle curl" [...] and a bound <b>edge</b> <b>trim.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Ensign had a cushion-grip {{handlebar}} {{that could}} be adjusted to height and an adjustable comb which lifted flattened stems which might not otherwise be cut. Polished beechwood front rollers allowed mowing up to the <b>lawn</b> <b>edge</b> and could be replaced quickly with sidewheels for cutting long or wet grass.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{production}} of CFRP needs <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> {{in order to}} remove burrs as well as undefined orientated fibres and to shape the final part contour. <b>Edge</b> <b>trimming</b> is usually done by contour milling. The quality of machined edges may be affected by fibre protrusions and delaminated fibres which cause manual repair or may even lead to scrap. Delamination of fibres is often initiated by stresses applied during engagement of the cutting edge. Based on measured cutting forces, the stress distribution and the inter fibre fracture modes in the boundary zone of the machined surface are calculated using Lekhnitskii's theory of elasticity for anisotropic elastic bodies and the fracture criteria of Puck. In course of the continuing <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> process, fibre ends in the damaged boundary zone might not be cut off but deflected by subsequent tool engagements, as {{can be observed in}} high speed videos. In the case of existing fibre protrusions, a relation between the minimum depth of the damaged zone, the fibre orientation at the machined edge and the fibre properties was derived using elementary bending models. The analysis underlines the existence of only one type of surface ply delamination i. e. fibre protrusions and fibre delamination always occur together...|$|R

40|$|A sawmill cuts logs into {{lumber and}} sells this lumber to {{secondary}} remanufacturers. The price a sawmiller can charge for lumber {{is dependent on}} its grade. In some species the cost of lumber will double in moving from one grade to the next higher grade.
