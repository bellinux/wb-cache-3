5|$|In June 2008, the {{possibility}} of television returning to Mount Washington came to <b>light,</b> <b>with</b> the filing by New Hampshire Public Television to move WLED-TV from its current location near Littleton to the old WMTW mast on top.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{would have}} used optical interferometry to accomplish these and other scientific goals. This technique collects <b>light</b> <b>with</b> multiple mirrors (in SIM's case, two) which is combined to make an interference pattern which can be very precisely measured.|$|E
5|$|Astrid Kruse Jensen (born 1975, {{educated in}} the Netherlands and Scotland) specializes in {{photographs}} taken at night which evoke the zone between reality and imagination. Carefully combining the effects of artificial <b>light</b> <b>with</b> the surrounding darkness, she creates mysterious images of lakes, swimming pools and solitary figures in the twilight. Since 2003, she has participated in key exhibitions in Denmark and elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Chabas studied under {{artists such}} as Tony Robert-Fleury, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and Albert Maignan. Although his earlier works were {{generally}} portraits, most of the painter's later production consisted of nude girls and young women. The lakes and rivers of France were common settings for his paintings, which gave prominence to the interaction of <b>light</b> <b>with</b> the models and their surroundings. September Morn is typical of his style.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus clouds, like {{cirrostratus}} clouds, {{can produce}} several optical effects, such as halos {{around the sun}} and moon. Halos are caused by interaction of the <b>light</b> <b>with</b> hexagonal ice crystals present in the clouds, which, depending on their shape and orientation, {{can result in a}} wide variety of white and colored rings, arcs and spots in the sky. Common halo varieties are the 22° halo, sun dogs, the circumzenithal arc and the circumhorizontal arc (also known as fire rainbows). Halos produced by cirrus clouds tend to be more pronounced and colorful than those caused by cirrostratus.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012, Bell {{applied for}} a patent on an {{invention}} which would improve fibre optic communication speeds and assist in transmitting long distances. Although yet to produce any fibre, Bell states his mathematical models show the velocity of light within the fiber can be improved to from 68% to 98% {{of the speed of}} <b>light</b> <b>with</b> lower optical loss and dispersion which would allow light pulses to be transmitted for longer distances without being smeared together over time and distance.|$|E

5|$|Mystery of the Emblem began {{development}} in 1992 during {{the production of}} Fire Emblem Gaiden. The staff from previous entries, including series creator Shouzou Kaga and composer Yuka Tsujiyoko, returned to their respective roles. While originally conceived as two separate projects, the team eventually merged the proposed remake of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of <b>Light</b> <b>with</b> the original story content of Mystery of the Emblem. The gameplay, which had veered away from the first game's tactical RPG routes in Gaiden, returned to its more traditional stance. The difficulty was lowered to encourage new players to try the series.|$|E
5|$|NY17A begins {{just south}} of NY17 exit124 {{in the village of}} Goshen. At the traffic <b>light</b> <b>with</b> the {{southern}} on-ramp from NY17 eastbound, NY207 becomes NY17A. The route quickly climbs to some of the hillier areas south of Goshen, offering views of not only Orange County's Black Dirt Region but Pochuck Mountain and High Point to the south in New Jersey. It then slowly descends past rolling meadows and farmland until it reaches the small village of Florida, where NY94 comes in from the west shortly after the village border. The concurrent roads then become Florida's main street.|$|E
5|$|On {{the island}} of Barbados, {{sustained}} winds peaked at 69mph (112km/h) while gusts reached 92mph (149km/h), which damaged many trees and roofs. A total of 531houses were damaged, of which 43 were completely destroyed. Additionally, four hotels sustained some damage. The winds left most of island without electricity, though officials worked quickly to restore the power. Rainfall from the storm was <b>light,</b> <b>with</b> less than 1inch (25mm) in most areas. Storm surge and wave action caused beach erosion that severely damaged most coastal roads. One death was reported on the island, and damage was estimated at more than $5million (2004USD, ($ USD).|$|E

5|$|Solid ionic {{compounds}} {{have long}} been used as paint pigments, and are resistant to organic solvents, but are sensitive to acidity or basicity. Since 1801 pyrotechnicians have described and widely used metal-containing ionic compounds as sources of colour in fireworks. Under intense heat, the electrons in the metal ions or small molecules can be excited. These electrons later return to lower energy states, and release <b>light</b> <b>with</b> a colour spectrum characteristic of the species present.|$|E
5|$|The defences of Saborsko {{were first}} {{breached}} at noon, and the attacking force reached {{the centre of}} the village at 3:30p.m. According to SAO Krajina sources, resistance was <b>light,</b> <b>with</b> the defending force estimated to consist of only 150 armed troops. The village was secured by 5p.m. with tanks attached to the attacking force withdrawn by 6p.m. The assault resulted in the death of 50 Croatian troops, while the attacking forces suffered only four wounded. In {{the immediate aftermath of the}} fighting to control Saborsko, the village was looted and many houses were torched.|$|E
5|$|The {{light was}} {{automated}} in 1979. Today, the lighthouse displays an occulting red <b>light</b> <b>with</b> a four-second period, having a nominal range of 12 nautical miles.

5|$|The {{lighthouse}} had two lights; {{the lower}} a fixed white {{light and the}} upper a quick flashing white light, showing every 60 seconds. However, this quick revolution gave the impression it was a fixed <b>light</b> <b>with</b> no flashes detectable. This {{may have contributed to}} the grounding, at Cefn Sidan, of the La Jeune Emma, bound from Martinique to Cherbourg in 1828. 13 of the 19 on board drowned, including Adeline Coquelin, the 12-year-old niece of Napoleon Bonaparte's divorced wife Joséphine de Beauharnais.|$|E
5|$|The marine hatchetfish is {{extremely}} flattened laterally (side to side), leaving the body just millimetres thick, {{and the body}} is so silvery as to resemble aluminium foil. The mirrors consist of microscopic structures {{similar to those used}} to provide structural coloration: stacks of between 5 and 10 crystals of guanine spaced about ¼ of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection. In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only blue <b>light</b> <b>with</b> a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Two unusual bag-like {{structures}} were present on each pitcher, one {{on either side}} of the central wing. Similar but semi-circular {{structures were}} found on the margin of the lid.

5|$|While passing {{near the}} {{northeast}} coast of Florida, Kyle produced a storm surge of 1.31feet (0.4m) in Fernandina Beach. Winds were <b>light,</b> <b>with</b> gusts peaking at 32mph (52km/h) in St. Augustine, and precipitation reached 2.05inches (52mm) in Fernandina Beach. Along the Georgia coastline, the storm dropped moderate rainfall that peaked at 5.35inches (136mm) at Hunter Army Airfield. Most of the precipitation {{fell in a}} 12‑hour period, which flooded roads and low-lying areas; several roads were closed, and numerous vehicles stalled in the floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|A few {{physicists}} {{persisted in}} developing semiclassical models in which electromagnetic radiation is not quantized, but matter appears {{to obey the}} laws of quantum mechanics. Although the evidence from chemical and physical experiments {{for the existence of}} photons was overwhelming by the 1970s, this evidence could not be considered as absolutely definitive; since it relied on the interaction of <b>light</b> <b>with</b> matter, and a sufficiently complete theory of matter could in principle account for the evidence. Nevertheless, all semiclassical theories were refuted definitively in the 1970s and 1980s by photon-correlation experiments. Hence, Einstein's hypothesis that quantization is a property of light itself is considered to be proven.|$|E
5|$|After the take-over, Oslo Sporveier {{immediately}} started expanding the tram network. On 4 May 1924, the Korsvoll Line was opened as {{a branch of}} the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line from Torshov northwestwards to Bjølsen. On 1 August 1925, the Ullevål Hageby Line was extended from Adamstuen further north to Ullevål Hageby. The Kjelsås Line opened on 25 September 1934 and ran from Storo on the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line northwards to Kjelsås station. By 1934, the municipality had gained full ownership of Oslo Sporveier. The new company also decided to increase the permitted car width to , allowing wider suburban trams to run in the city streets. During the 1930s, Oslo Sporveier decided it needed more rolling stock, and cooperated with Strømmens Værksted to create the Gullfisk ("Goldfish") class. Forty-six units were delivered from 1937 to 1940. Built with an aluminium chassis, they were quick and <b>light,</b> <b>with</b> a distinct streamlined shape, making their back ends look like a goldfish tail. On 1939, the Sinsen Line was extended from Carl Berners plass northwards to Sinsen. At this point the city had its most extensive tram network.|$|E
