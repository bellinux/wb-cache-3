25|$|The Australian bowlers <b>looked</b> <b>tired</b> and {{listless}} in {{the face}} of sustained batting with McGain taking a lot of punishment.|$|E
25|$|England {{had failed}} to {{capitalise}} on their breakthrough, and the Boon-Taylor partnership soon resumed the pace and tempo of the previous Taylor-Marsh one. They batted throughout the morning and Australia soon went past 400, with still only one wicket down. The England fielders <b>looked</b> <b>tired</b> and dejected. Mark Taylor soon brought up his personal 200, becoming the first Australian to score a double century in England since 1970. However, not long after, an exhausted looking Taylor tried to dance down the wicket once too often attempting to hit Cook down the ground, and was out excellently stumped by Russell for 219. His innings lasted just over 9 hours, during which he faced 461 balls and struck 23 fours. His dismissal saw Australia at 430 for 2, with the partnership of Boon and Taylor worth 101. It would remain Taylor's highest test score until he made an astonishing 334* during the 1998-99 Australia v Pakistan series.|$|E
25|$|By December 18, Gacy was {{beginning}} to show visible signs of strain {{as a result of}} the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, <b>looked</b> <b>tired,</b> appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 civil suit against the Des Plaines police, demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to a Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the parka pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor. This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11: the presence of the receipt indicated that Gacy must have been in contact with Robert Piest after the youth had left the Nisson Pharmacy on December 11.|$|E

25|$|Fred Trueman (0/59) gave Bobby Simpson and Bill Lawry a torrid time, {{his first}} ball to Simpson rolled onto the stumps, {{but failed to}} {{dislodge}} the bail and they survived the day with 16/0. They moved along to 104 by lunch, but not without a few scares. Brian Statham missed a simple caught and bowled off Simpson and Trueman's strong left arm nearly had Lawry run out while backing up. Simpson had made 109, 66 not out, 28, 122, 130, 9, 110 and 50 {{so far in the}} season and <b>looked</b> <b>tired</b> when he edged Ted Dexter (2/78) behind to the vigilant England wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 71 in a stand of 136. Norm O'Neill came in and promptly drove Dexter for 4, then hooked him for another. He took a boundary off Barry Knight and even Lawry joined in the act, hooking Statham to the boundary as they added 80 runs in 79 minutes. Knight was reduced to bowling down the leg-side without a slip and O'Neill hooked to the boundary and smashed him over mid-on, which even brought applause from Dexter. Lawry moved smoothly to 98 then hooked a long hop from Fred Titmus (1/81) into the hands of David Sheppard in the deep. Neil Harvey came out to attack the bowling - he rarely did anything else - and the runs flowed regardless of Dexter's attempts to plug the gaps. O'Neill was out to a beautiful ball from Statham (1/67) that cut back and had him lbw for 56 with 9 fours and Harvey's 57 with 6 fours ended when he tried to hit Dexter out of the ground and was caught by Statham at deep mid-off. Peter Burge (47 not out) had kept Harvey company in a stand of 84, and added 37 runs with Brian Booth (19 not out) in the last half hour and Australia were 362/4, 377 runs ahead {{by the end of the}} fourth day. Benaud's decision to not declare and have a bowl that evening was criticised by the press and several theories were advanced as to why. Some thought he was playing mind-games with the English batsmen, giving them an uncertain and nervous night, others that he was afraid of Dexter's batting power. A more likely explanation was that Benaud had suffered a groin strain after his 42 over marathon in the first innings and he didn't want to declare until he knew he would be fit on the last day. In any case after inspecting the wicket with Neil Harvey and bowling a few balls in front of the pavilion he declared ten minutes before play started. England were given 378 runs to win, a total that they have yet to make in a fourth innings against Australia.|$|E
500|$|The thirteenth stage (13 July) of the 1967 Tour de France {{measured}} {{it started}} in Marseille, crossing Mont Ventoux (the [...] "Giant of Provence") before finishing in Carpentras. At dawn Tour doctor, Pierre Dumas, met journalist, Pierre Chany, near his hotel. Dumas noted the warm temperature, [...] "If the boys stick their nose in a 'topette' [...] today, {{we could have a}} death on our hands". At the start line, a journalist noticed Simpson <b>looked</b> <b>tired</b> and ask him if the heat was the problem. Simpson replied, [...] "No, it's not the heat, it's the Tour." ...|$|E
500|$|Lamont {{has said}} that Labour lost the 2011 Scottish Parliament {{election}} because the party lost its direction, and that having failed to recognise the 2007 result as a defeat, it picked up the wrong signals from the 2010 general election that saw a strong Scottish Labour vote at Westminster. In February 2012 she told the Times Educational Supplement, [...] "We misread the 2010 (general) election, thinking it was confirmation that Scotland was a Labour country– it was probably confirmation that Scotland was still anti-Tory. There's an issue about rebuilding trust, and our confidence in the values that brought us into politics." [...] She told delegates at her party's 2012 Scottish conference {{that it was time}} for them to stop apologising for past mistakes. [...] "We know what happened last May – we <b>looked</b> <b>tired</b> and complacent and we got the kind of beating we deserved. But now, we need to start building the kind of Scottish Labour Party which Scotland deserves and which Scotland needs." ...|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began on}} Monday, December 11, 1989, and lasted for seven days. The episode was {{directed}} by David Carson, who had only filmed one other Next Generation episode before [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise". Carson felt that his relative lack of experience helped {{because he had no}} preconceptions about how episodes should be directed. Since much of the episode took place in the darker alternate universe, Carson wanted to emphasize the toll that decades of war had taken on the crew and the bridge. [...] "Picard really <b>looked</b> <b>tired</b> and worn and like a battle-weary commander, and that's what we wanted the bridge to look like—a battle weary bridge. I had lots of thoughts about making it as strong as possible using a lot of low lights, a lot of dark blues, making it very much more moody", he said. To heighten the impact of the physical set changes, Carson took a different approach to how he constructed shots. [...] "It was my intention to make it as much like a submarine as possible and to use low-angle lighting; basically, to do everything the opposite way that the Enterprise was normally shot." [...] The cameras were equipped with longer lenses than usual {{in order to reduce the}} depth of the scenes and provide a grittier feel. The use of low angles forced the lighting to be modified to prevent the scene from, in Carson's words, looking [...] "like a hotel lobby".|$|E
500|$|Both campaigns {{began to}} use their running mates to attack the other candidate. Republican Vice Presidential nominee Spiro Agnew criticized the current Vice President for being [...] "soft on communism" [...] and [...] "soft on {{inflation}} and soft on law and order." [...] He then compared the nominee to former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. But Agnew often made gaffes on the campaign trail, in contrast to Muskie who {{was viewed as a}} natural campaigner. In Missouri, in preparation for a meeting with former President Harry Truman, Muskie tried to defend his running mate from connections made by the Nixon campaign to the Johnson administration. He reversed the accusation by claiming that Nixon should be held accountable for the shortcomings of the Eisenhower Administration, under his logic. He then lambasted the Republican ticket for ignoring such issues as urban renewal, housing, and federal aid for education and sewage. Muskie was renowned for his speaking ability, and was known to turn around hostile crowds including one well publicized event when he asked an anti-war protester to join him on the stage. Although he provided a small boost for the campaign, Nixon remained fifteen points ahead, 44% to 29% in the September 27 Gallup poll. Diplomat George W. Ball soon resigned his position in the Johnson administration to campaign for and advise Humphrey, hoping to prevent a Nixon victory. At the end of September, Humphrey's chances for the presidency further declined as media outlets observed that the Republican Party would be the likely winners in the election. Humphrey acknowledged his odds, proclaiming at an event in Boston: [...] "regardless of the outcome of this election, I want it to be said of Hubert Humphrey that at an important and tough moment of his life he stood up for what he believed and was not shouted down." [...] The comment drew boos from the crowd. Individuals close to the campaign noted that Humphrey <b>looked</b> <b>tired</b> and worn-out while flying from stop to stop, but would brighten up when he encountered a crowd.|$|E
2500|$|All Saints {{are back}} in the groove. [...] All Saints did a good job {{showcasing}} some strong new material. [...] Forthcoming single 'Rock Steady' was another energetic, commercially viable highlight. They <b>looked</b> <b>tired</b> at times, especially Mel Blatt, who perspired heavily under the lights, and while their routines were competent, serious questions have to be asked about their live skills, with accusations of miming rumbling frequently around the room. Luckily for All Saints, this didn't feel like a symptom of decline, having always employed minimal physical effort, simple choreography, and heavily produced vocals. All Saints are not natural live performers, but against the odds, last night's showing provided some optimism about their comeback potential.|$|E
