40|$|Purpose: This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} maturity <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> management {{as well as}} the degree of to which the Circular Economy has been implemented in Basque SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 17 case studies were carried out in industrial SMEs companies in the Basque Country. Findings: The main results show that companies are limited to complying with the law and in many cases are worried about the image of the company, although they are not committed to environmental issues. There is still a lot to do in SMEs, as they are the companies that face the biggest challenges {{due to a lack of}} resources. Originality/value: Circular Economy aims to change a linear economy into promoting sustainability of the economy while also engaging in sustainable environmental protection. This research has focused on small and medium enterprises as they represent a 99 % of companies in Europe and they are the ones that have the most difficulty reaching a stage <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>excellence</b> due to their limited resources...|$|R
40|$|Company {{experience}} is that environmental constraints are throttling business progress. Pressures from legislation, insurance, finance and stakeholders, who all demand evidence <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>excellence,</b> are ever increasing. At the same time, the economic system is driving business in a predominantly unsustainable direction. In view of this dilemma, {{the need for a}} practical methodology enabling the full implementation of sustainable development into business cannot be overstated. Central to all this is a clear definition of what sustainable development means for industry in practice; how sustainable processing can be applied from first principles and the adoption of total sustainability as the ultimate goal. This paper aims to clarify the important issues involved in practical sustainable development and to assemble the elements of a practical methodology or toolkit, for the attainment of total sustainability in business.

40|$|Abstract: Skin {{sensitization}} is {{the most}} commonly reported occupational illness, causing much suffering {{to a wide range}} of people. Identification and <b>labeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> allergens is urgently required to protect people from skin sensitization. The guinea pig maximization test (GPMT) and murine local lymph node assay (LLNA) are the two most important in vivo models for identification of skin sensitizers. In order to reduce the number of animal tests, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) are strongly encouraged in the assessment of skin sensitization of chemicals. This paper has investigated the skin sensitization potential of 162 compounds with LLNA results and 92 compounds with GPMT results using a support vector machine. A particle swarm optimization algorithm was implemented for feature selection from a large number of molecular descriptors calculated by Dragon. For the LLNA data set, the classification accuracies are 95. 37 % and 88. 89 % for the training and the test sets, respectively. For the GPMT data set, the classification accuracies are 91. 80 % and 90. 32 % for the training and the test sets, respectively.

40|$|As {{companies}} {{discover the}} monetary benefits <b>of</b> a positive <b>environmental</b> image, {{a proliferation of}} green imaging confounds the public sphere. The consequence becomes the disarticulation <b>of</b> terms like <b>environmental</b> <b>excellence,</b> sustainable development, and minimum environmental harm. Because the oversaturation of greening efforts has elicited public distrust, stakeholders need timely and accurate information regarding environmental claims. As a major vehicle for communicating these efforts, corporate environmental reports (CERs) are laden with colorful and sublime images. This study examines the functionality of images found in CERs from 27 industry leaders, applying Sonja Foss’s tenets of visual rhetorical analysis to identify the nature and function of the images and offer an evaluation based on emergent themes. Because images are increasingly important to corporate transparency, the study concludes with several best practice recommendations to serve as ethical image design strategies and to reflect the ways companies address impactful operations...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades {{there is a growing}} body of {{literature}} on how to enhance farmers’ participation in voluntary subsidised agri-environmental programmes. However, additional unsubsidised agri-environmental measures that farmers perform are often ignored. The willingness to perform these measures may give a better insight into farmers’ motivation for agri-environmental measures than subsidised measures because it likely depends only on farmers’ intrinsic motivation and not on extrinsic factors such as a financial compensation. In this study we used an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to investigate which factors are associated with farmers’ intention to perform unsubsidised agri-environmental measures. Our results demonstrate that attitude, perceived social norms and perceived personal ability are significantly associated with farmers’ intention to perform these measures. However, self-identity is the most dominant predictor of farmers’ intentions. Furthermore we found that Environmental Cooperatives (ECs) positively influence farmers’ willingness to perform additional unsubsidised measures by means of facilitation and group pressure. We conclude that in order to increase farmers’ willingness to perform agri-environmental measures, self-identity should be addressed by means of e. g. benchmarking instruments in combination with commitment making or <b>labelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> friendly identities. Also, ECs are more important for unsubsidised measures than previously assumed – we recommended that they change their focus to include unsubsidised as well as subsidised conservation. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to outline the main {{economical}} and social benefits that can be obtained by adopting an ethical attitude of the organisations which use a performant environmental management. From the idea that the human being is the master of nature, it was passed to the view according to which the human being must ensure a balance between consumption and the use of resources. In order to achieve our goal we identified the factors that lead to long term or even permanent destructive effects over the environment and we briefly present the reasons for which the organizations adopt and implement environmental management systems. Also, the difficulties encountered in implementing environmental strategies have been briefly enumerated and the competitive and economic advantages that can be achieved by adopting an efficient environmental management and the main reasons that grant to the environmental management a special significance were exposed. This theoretical paper emphasizes the importance of the adoption by organizations of a "green behavior" and reveals correlations between sustainability, economic growth and environmental performance in organizations. The analysis of the ethical aspects <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> management shows the links that can be created between the development of an ethical culture of organizations and the achievement <b>of</b> the <b>environmental</b> <b>excellence.</b> The research provides an overview of the concept <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> ethics and encloses it within the scope <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> management. Someone needs to explain why an increasing number of organizations, both large and small, are setting up environmental management systems, making environmental investments and reducing risks over and beyond legal requirements, even when the benefits are not at all obvious, even in the long run. Also, this paper provides some practical examples <b>of</b> organizations <b>environmental</b> problems and points out how these organizations adapted their environmental strategies. The main conclusion of this conceptual paper is that organizations’ competitiveness in any industry and environmental protection are two interconnected concepts and we believe that there can be no excellence in business without <b>excellence</b> in <b>environmental</b> protection or vice versa...|$|R

40|$|Monkeys {{can easily}} form lasting central {{representations}} of visual and tactile stimuli, yet they seem {{unable to do}} the same with sounds. Humans, by contrast, are highly proficient in auditory long-term memory (LTM). These mnemonic differences within and between species raise {{the question of whether the}} human ability is supported in some way by speech and language, e. g., through subvocal reproduction of speech sounds and by covert verbal <b>labeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> stimuli. If so, the explanation could be that storing rapidly fluctuating acoustic signals requires assistance from the motor system, which is uniquely organized to chain-link rapid sequences. To test this hypothesis, we compared the ability of normal participants to recognize lists of stimuli that can be easily reproduced, labeled, or both (pseudowords, nonverbal sounds, and words, respectively) versus their ability to recognize a list of stimuli that can be reproduced or labeled only with great difficulty (reversed words, i. e., words played backward). Recognition scores after 5 -min delays filled with articulatory-suppression tasks were relatively high (75 – 80 % correct) for all sound types except reversed words; the latter yielded scores that were not far above chance (58 % correct), even though these stimuli were discriminated nearly perfectly when presented as reversed-word pairs at short intrapair intervals. The combined results provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that participation of the oromotor system may be essential for laying down the memory of speech sounds and, indeed, that speech and auditory memory may be so critically dependent on each other that they had to coevolve...|$|R
