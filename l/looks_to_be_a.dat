5|$|The second movie Cagney's company {{produced}} was Blood on the Sun. Insisting {{on doing}} his own stunts, Cagney required judo training from expert Ken Kuniyuki and Jack Halloran, a former policeman. The Cagneys {{had hoped that}} an action film would appeal more to audiences, but it fared worse {{at the box office}} than Johnny Come Lately. At this time, Cagney heard of young war hero Audie Murphy, who had appeared on the cover of Life magazine. Cagney thought that Murphy had the <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> movie star, and suggested that he come to Hollywood. Cagney felt, however, that Murphy could not act, and his contract was loaned out and then sold.|$|E

Gigantic and exceptional demonstrations occurred in Kuala Lumpur and other major cities.

500|$|Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack {{praised the}} Bree storyline, calling its scenes {{the best of}} the episode. He was {{critical}} of the Lynette storyline and highlighted its implausibility, calling it [...] "a cop-out and just an excuse for drama." [...] However, he appreciated the scene in which Lynette reveals her cancer to her friends. Stack enjoyed the addition of the Mayfair family, stating that although he was not a fan of Delany's acting, [...] "seems perfect for this role and <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> choice adversary for Bree." [...] He also praised the set-up for their mystery storyline. Stack was critical of the Edie character, opining: [...] "She used to be funny and sexy, but now she's just a big loon." [...] He dismissed Susan's storyline as [...] "lame" [...] and deemed the character [...] "obnoxious." [...] He also noted the significant absence of the Gabrielle character. [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today declared that the show was [...] "back in fine form." [...] He called the episode amusing, opining that the episode [...] "launched a plethora of promising stories while introducing welcome new residents Dana Delany and Nathan Fillion." [...] TV Guide Matt Roush enjoyed the episode, complimenting the addition of the new cast members. Regarding the Katherine character, he wrote, [...] "while she's obviously harboring a dark secret, at least there's no one trapped in the basement," [...] referencing the Betty Applewhite storyline from the second season. He identified the Susan and Mike storyline as problematic, as [...] "She's so annoying, and he's so boring." [...] Roush also noted that Felicity Huffman was [...] "making the most of her cancer storyline." ...|$|E
500|$|Wales wrote favorably {{about the}} film in 2007 during its production, and noted, [...] "Director Nic Hill is making what <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fabulous film about Wikipedia and Wikipedians worldwide." [...] However, Wales commented {{negatively}} about the delayed release, {{in a statement to}} PRNewser. He said the movie was dated due to its delay. He commented that the documentary was lopsided towards reliance on expert commentary and did not feature enough weight towards depicting community involvement in the online project. Wales posted to a Wikimedia Foundation mailing list, [...] "the film was poorly received in Poland, and it is seriously out of date." [...] Larry Sanger commented he thought the film was, [...] "Not too bad, from what I saw." [...] Wikimedia Foundation board member Samuel Klein commented, [...] "In general, I like the film a lot more after seeing it for the second time, in a very different audience (and seeing their live reactions)." [...] Sage Ross, an attendee of Wikimania 2010, commented that the film appears to take a mainly negative point of view towards Wikipedia, [...] "The film gives a lot of focus to some shallow or misleading lines of criticism, and on an intellectual level, it comes off as largely anti-Wikipedia, contrasting the reasonable-sounding arguments of mature critics with the naive optimism of youthful Wikipedians." [...] Author Ted Leonsis commented favorably about the documentary, at his blog, Ted's Take, characterizing it as, [...] "A great film about the Wikipedia movement." [...] He concluded, [...] "This is a must see film, a premiere film. You gotta watch it to remain socially relevant!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B overall. In her recap, she favored the Belle-centric storyline by giving it a B+: [...] "The upside, though, is a strong episode for Belle; Gaston is downright dishy (although still evil); and a Belle plot means more Rumple time, always welcome." [...] However, the other plotline garnered a C-: [...] "The main plot fared even better compared to the dumb B-plot, with Emma, Hook and Snow Scooby-ing up the place, with an enchanted elevator, a dream sequence, and what <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> wild goose chase that results in the discovery of Red/Ruby.

2500|$|A {{surprise}} mating {{attack is}} another way to swindle a win or draw from a lost position. In Karpov–Csom, Bad Lauterberg 1977, (left-most diagram), GM Csom has thoroughly outplayed the reigning world champion, and is a knight and pawn ahead with a completely winning position. Karpov's last move, 49.Rd1–d7, <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> last gasp before resigning. Csom played the solid-looking 49...Nf8??, saving the attacked knight and attacking White's rook. But after Karpov's 50.Nf5!! (right-most diagram), Csom resigned. GM John Emms explains, [...] "Black is mated in all variations; for example: 50...exf5 51.Qh2+ Kg8 52.Qg3+ and Qg7# follows; 50...Nxd7 51.Qh2+ Kg8 52.Qg3+ Kh8 53.Qg7#; 50...Nf4 51.Rh7+ Nxh7 52.Qg7#." [...] Emms considers 50.Nf5!! one of [...] "The Most Amazing Chess Moves of All Time", while Tim Krabbé calls it one of the [...] "Most Fantastic Moves Ever Played". Instead of 49...Nf8??, Csom could have won with 49...Ng5! Now 50.Nf5!? would be met by 50...exf5 51.Qh2+ Kg8 52.Qh6 Re1+ 53.Kh2 (53.Kf2 Qf3#) 53...Rh1+! 54.Kxh1 Nf4+ 55.Rd5 Nxd5 and wins. If instead 50.Nh5!? Rg8 51.Nxf6 (or 51.Rg7 Nh4) Nh4! threatening 52...Qg2# (note that White cannot force mate with 52.Rh7+, since 52...Nxh7 gives discovered check by the rook).|$|E

This craving, foolish rather than wise, we consider it thriftiest to satisfy at once; and shall give the King's NARRATIVE entire, {{though it is a}} jingling lean scraggy Piece, partly rhyme, [...] "in the manner of Bachaumont and La Chapelle;" [...] written at the gallop, a few days hence, and despatched to Voltaire:--"You," [...] dear Voltaire, [...] "wish to know what I have been about, since leaving Berlin; annexed you will find a description of it," [...] writes Friedrich. [OEuvres, xxii. 25 (Wesel, 2d Septemher, 1740).] Out of Voltaire's and other people's waste-baskets, it has at length been fished up, patch by patch, and pasted together by victorious modern Editors; and here it is again entire. The other Narrative, which got into the Newspapers soon after, is likewise of authentic nature,--Fassmann, our poor old friend, confirming it, if that were needful,--and is happily in prose. [Given in Helden-Geschichte, i. 420-423;--see likewise Fassmann's Merkwurdigster Regierungs-Antritt (poor old Book on FRIEDRICH'S ACCESSION); Preuss (Thronbesteigung, pp. 395-400); &c. &c.] Holding these two Pieces well together, and giving the King's faithfully translated, in a complete state, {{it will be possible to}} satisfy foolish cravings, and make this Strasburg Adventure luminous enough.|$|E
