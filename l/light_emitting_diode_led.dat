25|$|<b>Light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (<b>LED)</b> lamps {{are used}} for both general and {{special-purpose}} lighting. Compared to fluorescent bulbs, their advantages are that they contain no mercury, they turn on instantly at any temperature, their extremely long lifetime is unaffected by cycling on and off, they have no glass to break, and they don't emit UV rays that fade colored materials. LED lamps radiate almost no heat, and can be either multi-directional or unidirectional, {{eliminating the need for}} a mirrored reflector in the bulb or fixture. LED lamps can emit saturated colored light. Disadvantages include spectrum limitations due to discrete emission colors, and higher up-front cost than incandescent bulbs.|$|E

For example, AT's Bell Laboratories spearheaded the American technological revolution {{with a series}} of inventions including the <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (<b>LED),</b> the transistor, the C programming language, and the UNIX computer operating system. SRI International and Xerox PARC in Silicon Valley helped give birth to the personal computer industry, while ARPA and NASA funded the development of the ARPANET and the Internet. Companies like IBM and Apple Computer developed personal computers while Microsoft created operating systems and office productivity software to run on them. With the growth of information on the World Wide Web, search companies like Yahoo! and Google developed technologies to sort and rank web pages based on relevance. The web also has become a site for computer-mediated social interactions and web services like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter are used by millions to communicate. Miniaturization of computing technology and the increasing pervasiveness and speed of wireless networks had led to substantial adoption of mobile phones and increasingly powerful smartphones based on software platforms like Apple's iOS and Google's Android.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{technology}} used in home remote controls is infrared (IR) light. The signal between {{a remote control}} handset and the device it controls consists of pulses of infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye, but can be seen through a digital camera, video camera or a phone camera.
