Methods: We used 32 adult male European rabbits (Oryctolagus cunniculus) weighing from 2. 5 to 3. 5 kg. The study was performed on the deep flexor tendons of the second and third digits of the right hind paws of the rabbits; thus, a total of 64 tendons were examined in this study.

Conclusions: The <b>load</b> (<b>N)</b> significantly increased in subgroup 1 a in which the tendons were surgically repaired and were not treated with 5 -FU compared to subgroup 2 a in which the tendons were surgically repaired and treated with 5 -FU.

Objective: To evaluate the role of A 2 M in AD, the authors conducted a population-based study of LOAD and LOAD {{as well as a}} meta-analysis of all studies conducted to date. Methods: Patients with <b>LOAD</b> (<b>n</b> = 100) were derived from a population-based study in four northern provinces of the Netherlands and the area of metropolitan Rotterdam. Patients with <b>LOAD</b> (<b>n</b> = 344) were drawn from the Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective study on residents aged 55 years and over of a Rotterdam suburb in the Netherlands. Two polymorphisms were studied, A 2 M-I/D and A 2 M-Ile 1000 Val, in relation to the APOE epsilon 4 allele (APOE* 4). Results: No genotypic or allelic association was found for either polymorphism in the population-based series of patients with LOAD. In patients with EOAD without APOE* 4, a significant increase of carriers of A 2 M- 1000 Val was found. The meta-analysis of available published case-control data on these polymorphisms in white and mixed ethnic populations yielded no significant differences between cases and controls. Pooling the Asian studies conducted to date showed a significant decrease in the frequency of A 2 M-D among patients. Conclusions: These results suggest that A 2 M is not genetically associated with LOAD in white patients or mixed populations as found in the United States. In these populations A 2 M does not have clinical relevance. From a scientific perspective, the findings on EOAD and Asian patients require replication and further research in the A 2 M region. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Eutrophication forces {{shifts in}} estuarine {{producer}} assemblages from seagrass meadows to communities dominated by macroalgae. This {{restructuring of the}} benthic producer assemblage presents challenges and alters food resources available to consumers. We examined food web relationships in 3 sub-estuaries of the Waquoit Bay system, Massachusetts, USA, that span a gradient of relatively low nitrogen loads of 5, 10, and 34 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1. We detected effects on benthic macrophytes across this range of <b>N</b> <b>loads</b> with reduced seagrass cover and higher macroalgal biomass as <b>N</b> <b>loading</b> increased. The difference in <b>N</b> <b>loading</b> to these estuaries could also be detected in δ 15 N signatures of the benthic community. Producers and consumers were enriched in δ 15 N in response to increasing <b>N</b> <b>load</b> and incorporation of isotopically heavy nitrogen from wastewater sources. The differences in the relative availability of seagrass and macroalgae associated with the <b>N</b> <b>load</b> gradient were reflected in consumer diets. δ 13 C of producers were similar among the estuaries, but for consumers the isotopic signatures differed, suggesting they did not feed on the same primary producer sources. Using IsoSource, we modeled the diets of 2 herbivores, the amphipod Cymadusa compta and the isopod Erichsonella filiformis. At the lower <b>N</b> <b>loads,</b> more seagrass and detritus were consumed, whereas at the high <b>N</b> <b>load</b> where macroalgae was the dominant vegetation type, algae dominated the diet. The resulting C isotopic signatures appear to have permeated to higher trophic levels, suggesting C flow through the system differs across the range of <b>N</b> <b>loads</b> sampled. In the most pristine estuary, the overall food web was supported mainly by seagrass, its epiphytes and detritus, but macroalgal C was more important where this was the dominant type of macrophyte. These results demonstrate that C pathways through coastal food webs may be altered at earlier stages of eutrophication than previous studies have suggested. © Inter-Research 2011. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|In the U. S., 113 million pigs are transported {{annually}} to market, primarily by {{road in a}} tractor trailer. The conditions under which pigs are handled and transported can have {{a direct impact on}} their well-being, which may result in increased transport losses (the sum of dead on arrival and non-ambulatory (sum of fatigued and injured)). Transport losses cost 125 /head for dead on arrival and 37 /head for non-ambulatory pigs, which sum to 46 million yearly. The National Pork Board has recently funded research to improve pig well-being during handling and transport. The objectives of Chapter 3 were to compare the effects of 2 bedding levels on the (1) pig measures at the time of unloading and (2) transport losses during warm weather for market weight pigs. During warm weather, incorrect bedding levels on a trailer transporting market weight swine may result in heat stress, fatigue, and death. Two experiments were conducted in June and July 2011; Experiment 1 used 80 <b>loads</b> (<b>n</b> = 13, 887 pigs) {{to determine the effects of}} two bedding levels (3 - or six 22. 7 kg, 0. 2 m 3 bags of wood shavings/trailer) on pig measures (surface temperature, vocalizations, slips and falls, and stress signs). Experiment 2 used 131 <b>loads</b> (<b>n</b> = 22, 917 pigs) to determine the effects of bedding on transport losses (dead, sum of dead- and euthanized- on arrival; non-ambulatory, sum of fatigued and injured; total transport losses sum of dead and non-ambulatory). Bedding did not affect surface temperature, vocalizations, or slips and falls (P = 0. 58, P = 0. 50, and P = 0. 28, respectively). However, pigs transported on 6 bags/trailer had 1. 5...|$|R
