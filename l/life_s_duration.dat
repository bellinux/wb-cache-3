This paper introduces a method for characterizing the linear or nonlinear properties of the hemodynamic response. Such characterization is essential for accurate prediction of time-course behavior. Linearity of the BOLD response was examined in the primary visual cortex for manipulations of the stimulus amplitude and duration. Stimuli of 1, 2, 4, and 8 <b>s</b> <b>duration</b> (80 % contrast) and 10, 20, 40, and 80 % contrast (4 <b>s</b> <b>duration)</b> were {{used to test the}} hemodynamic response. Superposition of the obtained responses was performed to determine if the BOLD response is nonlinear. The nonlinear characteristics of the BOLD response were assessed using a Laplacian linear system model cascaded with a broadening function. Discrepancies between the model and the observed response provide an indirect measure of the nonlinearity of the response. The Laplacian linear system remained constant within subjects so the broadening function can be used to absorb nonlinearities in the response. The results show that visual stimulation under 4 <b>s</b> in <b>duration</b> and less than 40 % contrast yield strong nonlinear responses...|$|R

The method is verified on a test data set recorded across the rupture zone of the 1992 Landers earthquake, for which trapped waves were previously identified manually, and is then applied to a larger data set with several thousand events recorded across the San Jacinto fault zone.

L-LTP was induced with three trains of tetanization of 1 <b>s</b> <b>duration</b> at 100 Hz separated by 10 -min intervals. Neither LY 367385 nor MPEP affected basal synaptic responses at the doses used (200 and 10 mM, respectively) and only the mGluR 5 inhibitor MPEP blocked L-LTP.

40|$|Electrically-evoked low-frequency (submaximal) {{force is}} {{increased}} immediately following high-frequency stimulation in human skeletal muscle. Although central mechanisms {{have been suggested}} to be the major cause of this low-frequency force potentiation, intramuscular factors might contribute. Thus, we hypothesized that two intramuscular Ca 2 +-dependent mechanisms {{can contribute to the}} low-frequency force potentiation: increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + release and increased myofibrillar Ca 2 + sensitivity. Experiments in humans were performed on the plantar flexor muscles at a shortened, intermediate, and long muscle length and electrically evoked contractile force and membrane excitability (i. e., M-wave amplitude) were recorded during a stimulation protocol. Low-frequency force potentiation was assessed by stimulating with a low-frequency tetanus (25 Hz, 2 <b>s</b> <b>duration),</b> followed by a high-frequency tetanus (100 Hz, 2 <b>s</b> <b>duration),</b> and finally followed by another low-frequency (25 Hz, 2 <b>s</b> <b>duration)</b> tetanus. Similar stimulation protocols were performed on intact mouse single fibers from flexor digitorum brevis muscle, whereby force and myoplasmic free [Ca 2 +] ([Ca 2 +]i) were assessed. Our data show a low-frequency force potentiation that was not muscle length-dependent in human muscle and it was not accompanied by any increase in M-wave amplitude. A length-independent low-frequency force potentiation could be replicated in mouse single fibers, supporting an intramuscular mechanism. We show that at physiological temperature (31 °C) this low-frequency force potentiation in mouse fibers corresponded with an increase in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2 + release. When mimicking the slower contractile properties of human muscle by cooling mouse single fibers to 18 °C, the low-frequency force potentiation was accompanied by minimally increased SR Ca 2 + release and hence it could be explained by increased myofibrillar Ca 2 + sensitivity. Finally, introducing a brief 200 ms pause between the high- and low-frequency tetanus in human and mouse muscle revealed that the low-frequency force potentiation is abolished, arguing that increased myofibrillar Ca 2 + sensitivity is the main intramuscular mechanism underlying the low-frequency force potentiation in humans...|$|R
