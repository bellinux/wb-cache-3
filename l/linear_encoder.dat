40|$|The term {{precision}} linear actuator, {{direct drive}} (PLADD) {{refers to a}} robust linear actuator designed {{to be capable of}} repeatedly performing, over a lifetime of the order of 5 to 10 years, positioning maneuvers that include, variously, submicron increments or slews of the order of a centimeter. The PLADD is capable of both long stroke (120 mm) and high resolution (repeatable increments of 20 nm). Unlike precise linear actuators of prior design, the PLADD contains no gears, levers, or hydraulic converters. The PLADD, now at the prototype stage of development, is intended for original use as a coarse-positioning actuator in a spaceborne interferometer. The PLADD could also be adapted to terrestrial applications in which there are requirements for long stroke and high resolution: potential applications include medical imaging and fabrication of semiconductor devices. The PLADD (see figure) includes a commercially available ball-screw actuator driven directly by a commercially available three-phase brushless DC motor. The ball-screw actuator comprises a spring-preloaded ball nut on a ball screw that is restrained against rotation as described below. The motor is coupled directly (that is, without an intervening gear train) to a drive link that, in turn, is coupled to the ball nut. By eliminating the gear train, the direct-drive design eliminates the complexity, backlash, and potential for misalignment associated with a gear train. To prevent inadvertent movement, there is a brake that includes flexured levers compressed against the drive link by preload springs. This is a power-off brake: There are also piezoelectric stacks that can be activated to oppose the springs and push the levers away from the drive link. Hence, power must be applied to the piezoelectric stacks to release the drive link from braking. To help ensure long operational life, all of the mechanical drive components are immersed in an oil bath within hermetically sealed bellows. The outer end of the bellows holds the outer end of the ball screw, thereby preventing rotation of the ball screw. Positioning is controlled by an electronic control system that includes digital and analog subsystems that interact with the motor and brake and with two sensor/encoder units: a Hall-effect-sensor rotation <b>encoder</b> and a <b>linear</b> glass-scale <b>encoder.</b> This system implements a proportional + integral + derivative control algorithm that results in variation of voltage commands to each of the three pairs of windings of the brushless DC motor. In one of two alternative control modes, the voltages are applied to the windings in a trapezoidal commutation scheme on the basis of timing signals obtained from the Hall-effect sensors; this scheme yields relatively coarse positioning - 24 steps per motor revolution. The second control mode involves a sinusoidal commutation scheme in which the output of the <b>linear</b> glass-scale <b>encoder</b> is transposed to rotational increments to yield much finer position feedback - more than 400, 000 steps per revolution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- One of the {{research}} goals in robotics {{is the development of}} home-help robots. The development of a control approach for a novel lightweight and multifunctional shape memory alloy (SMA) actuator scalable in force and length for robots is presented in this paper. The SMA actuator is based on lightweight bundles of thin wires of prestrainend shape memory alloy that change their length when heated above their transformation temperature. The design approach of the actuator allows arranging the point of actuation in any direction and ensures a short cool down time to guarantee a frequency of contraction/stress cycles that is high enough to allow fast joint motions. This is needed for the generation of fast joint motions. For the use of the actuator the novel control approach has been experimentally validated. The approach uses the resistance of the actuator as a <b>linear</b> position <b>encoder</b> and there are no additional external sensors needed. The application of the new actuator to a novel lightweight humanoid robot is outlined.

The shadow-sensors {{were designed to}} detect ‘Violin-Mode’ (VM) resonances in the 0. 4 mm diameter silica fibre suspensions of the test-masses / mirrors of advanced LIGO gravitational wave interferometers. Each sensor illuminated the fibre under test, so as to cast its narrow shadow onto a ‘synthesized split photodiode’ detector, the shadow falling over adjacent edges of the paired photodiodes. The apparatus described here translated a vertically orientated silica test fibre horizontally through a collimated Near InfraRed illuminating beam, whilst simultaneously capturing the separate DC ‘shadow notch’ outputs {{from each of the}} paired split photodiode detectors. As the ratio of AC to DC photocurrent sensitivities to displacement was known, a calibration of the DC response to quasi-static shadow displacement allowed the required AC sensitivity to vibrational displacement to be found. Special techniques are described for generating the required constant scan-rate for the test-fibre using a DC motor-driven stage, for removing ‘jitter’ at such low translation rates from a <b>linear</b> magnetic <b>encoder,</b> and so for capturing the two shadow-notch signals at each micrometre of the test-fibre’s travel.
