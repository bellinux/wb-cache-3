60|$|We {{were all}} {{stunned by the}} dreadful news from England. It was very sad old Sir Francis, who had borne without {{complaint}} the loss of land, honours, and home, nay, who had stood by to see his only son die at Naseby, sitting like one crushed, and only able to mutter now and then: 'My Master, my good Master.' You might know an English exile in those days by the mourning scarf and sad countenance. I remember a poor wild cavalier whom my mother and Meg never <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> when Eustace was not at home, going {{down on his knees}} to Lady Ommaney for a bit of black silk, when {{he looked as if he}} was starving.|$|E
5000|$|The French Rococo was at {{its height}} in the 1730s and its {{influence}} {{can be seen in}} the painting despite Hogarth not visiting France until 1743. William Gaunt thought that Hogarth was more familiar with current French painting than he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit.</b> The girl's aprons form serpentine S's, vertically in the oldest child, ending as it falls over her arm, and horizontally in the younger girl. A similar shape {{can be seen in the}} falling curtain on the right. The heads of the children and the cat create another noticeable S shape. The fruit bowl, a common subject in Rococo art, has been described as a [...] "bravura piece of still-life painting" [...] untypical of Hogarth's work.|$|E

5000|$|Josh Hartnett as Ethan Chandler (born Ethan Lawrence Talbot), a charming, brash {{and daring}} American man of action with uncanny marksmanship, who detests violence, {{and is more}} {{complicated}} than he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't she?" [...] Mrs. Burton demanded. [...] "And her {{daughter}} gets all her artistic talent from her. Mrs. Saunders is an artist, though I don't suppose you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it of a dressmaker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, of course, Mr. Meadow Mouse didn't {{know what}} was in the bag and he didn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that he was working for another, for he was very proud, was Mr. Meadow Mouse.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{a longer}} tramp than they suspected, however, and night overtook {{them before they}} could reach the flat mountain. So Ozma {{proposed}} they camp for the night and Dorothy was quite ready to approve. She didn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> her friend she was tired, but she told herself that her legs [...] "had prickers in 'em," [...] meaning they had begun to ache.|$|R
6000|$|Slowly Peter {{reached over}} {{his back with}} his long left hind foot and thoughtfully {{scratched}} his long right ear. He didn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that he couldn't recall those two cousins of Chebec's. [...] "Did you say your fighting cousin?" [...] he asked in a hesitating way.|$|R
5000|$|Don't criticize, condemn, or complain. Human nature {{does not}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> fault. When people are criticized or humiliated, they rarely respond well and will often become {{defensive}} and resent their critic. To handle people well, {{we must never}} criticize, condemn or complain because it will never result in the behavior we desire.|$|R
5000|$|After reading {{works by}} Richard Neustadt and Samuel P. Huntington, among others, Allison {{proposed}} a third model, which takes account of court politics (or [...] "palace politics"). While statesmen don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> they play politics {{to get things}} done, especially in high-stakes situations such as the Cuban missile crisis, they nonetheless do.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the waitresses}} in Cafe Little Wish. Merun has an energetic, and quirky personality. She has a classic tsundere personality, and {{constantly}} quarrels with the protagonist. As {{she is always}} trying to compete with Leon, Merun finds it difficult {{to be nice to}} him. Merun is generally outspoken, but whenever she notices one of Leon's good qualities, she doesn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it.|$|R
5000|$|It's also a {{story about}} a [...] James has almost spitefully decided to hate Ireland and idealize America. As he's just 16, he's lived only 10 years in the U.S. and 6 in Ireland, hardly enough time for him to really relate to either. Additionally, in the 6 years there, he's {{inadvertently}} developed an Irish accent. It's clear to us that he's much more Irish than he'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit.</b>|$|R
500|$|Burke premiered {{the song}} on 25 August 2009, on The Chris Moyles Show. [...] Before its release, The Sun had leaked lyrics from the song online. In an {{interview}} with Popjustice {{when asked about the}} song, Burke said, [...] "I've got a passion against liars, but I do like myself a bad boy. All young girls my age go for them, we just don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it, because we always go for them".|$|R
5000|$|... "Human {{relations}} among us still {{suffer from the}} former enslavement of {{a large portion of}} our predecessors. The freedom of the free, the growth of freedom experienced in the American Revolution depended more than we <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> on the enslavement of more than 20 percent of us at that time. How republican freedom came to be supported, at least in large part, by its opposite, slavery, {{is the subject of this}} book." ...|$|R
25|$|Series 1 {{featured}} Bodger and Badger {{working in}} Troff's Nosherama, a run-down café with pretensions {{to being a}} restaurant. While Bodger worked in the kitchens as a chef, both he and Badger made friends with the waitress, Mavis. Troff's Nosherama was run by Mr Troff who was very arrogant, tight-fisted and didn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> when he was wrong. Troff {{had no idea of}} Badger's presence {{until the end of the}} last episode in the series.|$|R
5000|$|Scanzoni was {{a leading}} {{authority}} of obstetrics in 19th-century Europe. He is best remembered today for the birthing procedure known as the [...] "Scanzoni maneuver". In 1849 he was {{a major factor in}} the appointment of Rudolf Virchow to the chair of pathological anatomy at the University of Würzburg. [...] He was an ardent critic of Ignaz Semmelweis. However, in later years, he became convinced Semmelweis was correct, even if he did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it.|$|R
50|$|Saji's lack {{of shame}} and straightforwardness in his words and actions are {{at the same time}} an {{annoyance}} to Koizumi {{and one of the things}} she likes most about him. For while Saji never hesitates to show his feelings, Koizumi is easily embarrassed when it comes <b>to</b> <b>admitting</b> her own. Because of this, especially in public, she is prone to loudly denying that she cares about Saji at all. The truth however is that she is much more perverted herself than she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> and often has trouble (or simply fails to) control her own desire for Saji.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Thurwell said no more. He was {{a little}} dazed by those letters, {{but he was not}} going to allow himself to be {{influenced}} by them, for his daughter's sake, as well as his own. He did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> himself in the wrong, and he had made up his mind that this man was innocent. Innocent he must therefore be proved. As to his defending himself, that was all nonsense. He would see to that. Dewes should be instructed.|$|R
2500|$|Tan {{draws from}} a large source of {{inspiration}} and cites many influences on his work. His comment on the subject is: [...] "I’m pretty omnivorous {{when it comes to}} influences, and I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> this openly." [...] Some influences are very direct. The Lost Thing is a strong example where Tan makes visual references to famous artworks. Many of his influences are a lot more subtle visually, some of the influences are ideological. Below are some influences he has named in various interviews: ...|$|R
40|$|A {{law school}} job talk for an {{entry-level}} candidate {{is an opportunity}} for the presenter to put his or her ideas before a faculty in the best possible light. A bit of give-and-take is part of the drill, but the candidate can usually expect the talk to stay more or less on course. My own first job talk, though, given at George Mason University more years ago than I 2 ̆ 7 d <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> was attended by the thoroughly exceptional Larry Ribstein and so did not unfold in the usual way...|$|R
40|$|The Power to Tax {{seeks to}} replace one {{economic}} orthodoxy with another. Despite their iconoclasm, Geoffrey Brennan and James Buchanan {{are closer to}} mainline public finance economists than they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit.</b> Both the dominant orthodoxy and The Power to Tax fail to transcend the limits of neoclassical economics as a formal theory of political economy. While their methods of evasion are different, both iconoclasts and mainliners fail to take seriously the distinctive features of modern democratic policies - elections, bureaucracy, and an ongoing effort at complex normative evaluation...|$|R
5000|$|Though he doesn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it publicly, he is {{faithful}} to Lucille; the closest he {{ever came to}} adultery was during the episode [...] "Hotel Oceanview", where he got drunk and began kissing a woman he vaguely recognized from high school, but couldn't place...who {{turned out to be}} a man who had undergone sex reassignment surgery (when she informed Herb of this, Herb's initial response was to curl up in the fetal position, and then protest to everyone that [...] "just because I kissed him, that doesn't make me gay.").|$|R
40|$|Look at your bookshelf, {{or think}} of the books you have at home. Do you have {{anything}} by the following authors: Judy Blume, J K Rowling, Phillip Pullman, Sherman Alexie, Suzanne Collins, Laurie Halse Anderson, John Steinbeck, Mark Twain, Toni Morrison, Lois Lowry, Gary Paulson or Stephan Chbosky? If you do, you are harboring a work that has been either challenged or banned in the past 10 years. I know, some of you are blown away; how archaic, to ban books, especially ones as harmless as some of these. But it happens, more often than {{many of us would}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit...</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "We are not immune. Our {{school is}} not and our {{students}} are not. And all that’s {{out there in the}} world scares us more than we’d <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit.</b> We at St. Benedict at Auburndale are participating in this drug testing program for one PRIMARY purpose … to provide our students with yet one more reason they can draw upon when faced with choosing for or against drugs. Some are able to make that choice on their own without any fear at all of social pressure or peer ramifications. But some are not. And we hope that this program will ease their decision-making." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1920s Oslo, Henrik Larsen (Gard B. Eidsvold), an {{aspiring}} poet, leaves his girlfriend (Camilla Martens) {{to spend a}} year as a trapper in Greenland, where he is teamed with a sailor (Stellan Skarsgård) and a scientist (Bjørn Sundquist). The men are trapped in a tiny hut, as the arctic winter sets in, and a complex and intense love/hate relationship develops between the poet and the sailor - both who are more similar to one another than either would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit.</b> Their conflict plays out in isolation amidst stunningly bleak arctic scenery, filmed in Svalbard.|$|R
5000|$|Author Bruce Cumings, in {{his book}} [...] "War and Television", stated [...] "the {{major part of the}} Sinch’on massacres were carried out by Koreans who had fled the Sinch’on area for the south. In my opinion, if any US forces were present they were {{probably}} KMAG (Korean Military Advisory Group) personnel who witnessed many South Korean atrocities against civilians; the Koreans I spoke with were adamant that the US carried out the massacres, but {{it is also true that}} Koreans do not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that Koreans could do such things, unless they are following US or (in the colonial period) Japanese orders." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the Cheers {{biography}} documentary, costar Ted Danson admitted {{there was}} tension between them but [...] "never at {{a personal level}} and always at a work level" [...] due to their different modes of working. He also stated that Long was much more like her character than she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> but also said that her performances often [...] "carried the show." [...] Long said in later interviews {{that it did not}} occur to her, when deciding to leave, {{that she was going to}} 'sabotage a show' and she felt confident that the rest of the cast could continue without her.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{drama in}} which friend Arthur piques himself {{on having a}} pretty part to play," [...] said Mr. Irwine, smiling. But when he saw Arthur colour, he went on relentingly, [...] "My part, you know, is always that of the old fogy who sees nothing to admire in the young folks. I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that I'm proud of my pupil when he does graceful things. But I must play the amiable old gentleman for once, and second your toast in honour of Adam. Has your {{grandfather}} yielded on the other point too, and agreed to have a respectable man as steward?" ...|$|R
40|$|Your bait of {{falsehood}} {{takes this}} carp of truth: And thus do we {{of wisdom and}} of reach, With windlasses and with assays of bias, By indirections find directions out (Hamlet. Act 2, Scene 1). I have the impression therefore that in my future life some great and magnificent satisfaction is in store for me [...] . that great fame will be attached to my name surpassing that {{of thousands of other}} people much better mentally endowed (Daniel Paul Schreber). It remains the future to decide whether there is more delusion in my theory that I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> or whether there is more truth i...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1972 {{documentary}} Winter Soldier a Marine Sergeant {{testified that}} [...] "on Operation Medina 200 {{of us went}} out and 47 made it back and they just ambushed us and wiped {{the hell out of}} us and I didn't see any gooks, man. They were sitting in the trees dropping grenades on us and they had machine-guns on the front and the side and the newspapers said we had all these kills, you know. I didn't know what the hell they were talking about. I never saw any kills. But they just didn't want <b>to,</b> <b>like,</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that all those men got killed for nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|Little Joe Otter {{found that}} out when he took Grandfather Frog's advice. He wouldn't have {{admitted}} that {{he was afraid of}} Buster Bear. No one ever <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> being afraid, least of all Little Joe Otter. And really Little Joe {{has a great deal of}} courage. Very few of the little people of the Green Forest or the Green Meadows would willingly quarrel with him, for Little Joe is a great fighter when he has to fight. As for all those who live in or along the Laughing Brook or in the Smiling Pool, they let Little Joe have his own way in everything.|$|R

(It was co-produced by the Smithsonian Institution....) The show attracted sixty million viewers, making it the highest-rated program of the week. Sunn [...] took the documentary on a four-wall tour ...." [...] This show included footage from the Patterson–Gimlin film. John Green wrote of this show's popularity, [...] "Almost everyone is interested in monsters, only most people don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it.... But let some official organization show an interest in a monster, and the situation reverses. When it has somehow been made respectable, a monster story attracts a tremendous public response." ...|$|R
40|$|George Moore, {{either by}} his own {{management}} or by the intervention of fate, has been an outstanding figure of every important literary movement within the last fifty years.
