40|$|Abstract: Associations between root {{diseases}} and <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> (Scolytidae) constitute {{some of the}} most serious pest complexes affecting forests in North America and elsewhere. The interactive functioning of these pests derives from the following relationships: 1) root diseases predispose trees to <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> infestation by lowering resistance, and perhaps increasing attractiveness, of trees to the attacking beetles; 2) <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> may be vectors of root disease fungi or may create infection courts for them. Symbioses between <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> and fungi are common in nature, and previous reviewers (e. g., Graham 1967) have identified several types of these symbiotic relationships, some of which appear to be beneficial to both (mutualism), and others which apparently benefit only one (competition, predation, parasitism).
