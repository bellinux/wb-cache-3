He was head-hunted for the series by its creator Chris Carter, who had seen his work on the series Strange Luck. McLachlan was initially offered a position shooting Carter's other active series, The X-Files, then in its third season, but was unable to start work in time. He developed a distinctive style for the series, shooting it with desaturated colours and <b>lighting</b> <b>scenes</b> as though they were to be filmed in black and white; he also made use of high-intensity strobe lighting usually employed for advertising and macro cinematography. McLachlan has noted that this style briefly became popular after the series' broadcast but that other cinematographers had difficulty adjusting to it.|$|E

2500|$|The {{lighting}} for {{the tour}} was done by UK lighting company HSL, which also supplied the crew. HSL previously worked with the band for their tours in 2006 & 2007. The lighting on the tour {{is based on the}} concept of [...] "creative synergy", which employs four visual mediums – lighting, digital lighting, video and movement. The initial ideas came from the band itself, who pitched them to Davy Sherwin, lighting & visuals director. Sherwin had previously worked with the band on their tours in 2006 & 2007. He came up with a simple arrangement of LED and moving lights, which he felt went well with the music of the album. A metalwork layout of five trusses running upstage/downstage was then added, referring [...] "sun rays" [...] from the album title. The trusses are hinged down at upstage end, so they are freely movable into the performance area. After the design was finalized, Sherwin started to program the show on an ESP Vision visualizer system. He then recorded every song onto a hard drive, and made QuickTime movies of the <b>lighting</b> <b>scenes.</b> These were used by Robin Haddow (live visuals director) and Blue Leach (video director) to program the screen looks, colors and effects, referring to Sherwin's cues. They rehearsed the show for six days at Wembley Arena. In live concerts, Sherwin, Haddow and Leach work together to ensure all four cues (lighting, digital lighting, video and movement) work properly. Sherwin and Haddow operate two WholeHog 3 consoles each, and Rupert Reynolds works the Kinesys system, which produces the effects. The tour is the first ever to use Barco's digital moving lights.|$|E

50|$|The major {{advantage}} of a lighting control system over stand-alone lighting controls or conventional manual switching {{is the ability to}} control individual lights or groups of lights from a single user interface device. This ability to control multiple light sources from a user device allows complex <b>lighting</b> <b>scenes</b> to be created. A room may have multiple scenes pre-set, each one created for different activities in the room. A major benefit of lighting control systems is reduced energy consumption. Longer lamp life is also gained when dimming and switching off lights when not in use. Wireless lighting control systems provide additional benefits including reduced installation costs and increased flexibility over where switches and sensors may be placed.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a home lighting robot that uses directional spotlights to create complex <b>lighting</b> <b>scenes.</b> The robot senses its visual environment using a panoramic camera {{and attempts to}} maintain its target goal state by adjusting the positions and intensities of its lights. Users can communicate desired changes in the lighting environment through speech and gesture (e. g., "Make it brighter over there"). Information obtained from these two modalities are combined to form a goal, a desired change in the lighting of the scene. This goal is then incorporated into the system's target goal state. When the target goal state and the world are out of alignment, the system formulates a sensorimotor plan that acts on the world to return the system to homeostasis. by Joshua Juster. Thesis (M. Eng.)

30|$|In {{the present}} experiments, ten primary perceptual {{attributes}} were studied: Overall Pleasantness, Overall Brightness, Overall Diffuseness, Contrast, Uniformity, Shadow Visibility, Coziness, Liveliness, Tenseness, and Detachment (Businesslike). This set of attributes {{can be thought}} of as three distinct groups. One is overall impressions – Pleasantness and Brightness; a second is perceived atmosphere – Coziness, Liveliness, Tenseness, and Detachment – terms that Vogels found to be orthogonal descriptors via factor analysis. The third group has to do with the uniformity of light distribution – Diffuseness, Contrast, Uniformity, and Shadow Visibility. These distribution attributes presumably correlate to some extent, but without enough a priori knowledge to select a representative single term or subset they were all used. Our assertion is that if observers’ responses to these perceptual attributes in virtual presentations match those in analogous real-world environments, then we have accomplished perceptual accuracy. Our research track has focused on quantifying how the perceptual accuracy is affected by the choices made in the creation and presentation of visualizations of <b>lighting</b> <b>scenes.</b>|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{has been}} created and to be applied {{for the use of}} the object of Pizzeria {{restaurant}} in Moravský Písek. Within this thesis there was a literature search used focused on the lighting system design. The IT technology was used, especially the Relux and Vivaldi applications. The current condition of the lighting system in the object has been evaluated by using the manual measuring and the actual module within the Relux application. The current condition has been evaluated as truly insufficient for the kitchen related work environment. Moreover, in each room a relatively strong glare has been detected. The following step was to design a new lighting system that meets all the criteria set by Standard IEC 12464 - 1. The new lighting system provides visual comfort and accurate visual performance for the personnel working within this environment. The thesis also comes up with the suggestions of the dynamic <b>lighting</b> <b>scenes,</b> which have been created by using the Vivaldi application for each room.

40|$|To {{predict how}} the not yet built {{environment}} {{is going to}} appear regarding light and colour is a crucial problem for architects and designers. 3 D-visualization is an established design tool and used for representations of project proposals. In many cases, the aim with the visualizations is to make good-looking images sell the design. In order for software, such as 3 Dsmax to become a usable planning tool of light and colour in buildings, the visualization must be trusted to show the correct appearance {{in accordance with the}} physical preconditions of reality. The complex interaction between light and objects makes the problem of <b>lighting</b> <b>scenes</b> central within computer graphics. In a previous study (2006, 2005, 2004), various problems related to the rendering of light and colour in interactive models made in 3 Dsmax. Since then, the technology within colour rendering and computer graphics has moved forward. This paper discusses the problems of translating reality to its digital counterpart. New tests were performed in 3 Dsmax in order to explore the usability of various rendering techniques and to explore the trustworthiness of colour and light representations. We deal with methodological issues concerning how to compare visual results between different media, mixed adaptation and arbitrary parameter setting in the software. In the earlier studies carried out 10 years ago, a 25 m 2 real room was compared to different Virtual Reality (VR) simulations. In order to get a simulation as correct as possible of the 6 fluorescent luminaires (2 ceiling armatures and 4 wall washers) the manufacturer Fagerhult’s own IES-files were used. At that time, this photometric light could only be rendered with the default Scanline renderer in 3 Dsmax, which resulted in significant differences between the real and the virtual rooms. The VR-models had incorrect reflection effects between surfaces, too few colour variations and too achromatic shadows. Also they had incorrectly reproduced contrast effects for the lightest surfaces. The surface that was perceived as the whitest in the room appeared too grey. In our new study, the original models in 3 Dsmax Design 2014 were rendered with the Scanline renderer, Mental Ray and V-ray. The light planning software Dialux was used for comparison regarding the light level and distribution. Preliminary results show improvement regarding interreflections and colour variations. However, there are still incorrectly reproduced contrast effects and the whitest areas appear too grey. The light level also differed compared to the situation in Dialux, even if the same light fixtures and IES-files where applied. Furthermore, we will discuss issues concerning the choice of correct parameters to represent the physical prerequisites of reality, such as the problem of deciding how many times a light should bounce. One dilemma is that the architects and designers have knowledge of colour and light in reality, however do not usually know how to use all features in the software. The professional visualizers know how to manipulate 3 D-models to look good, but often do not regard physical correctness...|$|E
40|$|Movie {{directors}} and producers worldwide, {{in their quest}} to narrate a good story that warrants repeated audience viewing, use many cinematic elements to intensify and clarify the viewing experience. One such element that directors manipulate is lighting. In this paper we examine one aspect of lighting, namely flashing lights, and its role as an intensifier of dramatic effects in film. We present an algorithm for robust extraction of flashing lights and a simple mechanism to group detected flashing lights into flashing <b>light</b> <b>scenes</b> and analyze the role of these segments in story narration. In addition, we demonstrate how flashing lights detection can improve the performance of shot-based video segmentation. Experiments on a number of video sequences extracted from real movies yields good results. Our technique detects 90. 4 % of flashing lights. The detected flashing lights correctly eliminates 92. 7 % of false cuts in these sequences.
