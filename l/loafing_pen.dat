40|$|A {{protocol}} that {{consisted of}} an isolation flux chamber and a portable gas chromatograph was used to directly quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at a dairy and a feedyard operation in the Texas Panhandle. Field sampling campaigns were performed 5 consecutive days only during daylight hours from 9 : 00 am to 7 : 00 pm each day. The objective {{of this research was}} to quantify and compare GHG emission rates (ERs) from ground level area sources (GLAS) at dairy and cattle feedyard operations during the summer. A total of 74 air samples using flux chamber were collected from the barn (manure lane and bedding area), <b>loafing</b> <b>pen,</b> open lot, settling basin, lagoons, and compost pile within the dairy operation. For the cattle feedyard, a total of 87 air samples were collected from four corner pens of a large feedlot, runoff holding pond, and compost pile. Three primary GHGs (methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide) were measured and quantified from both operations. The aggregate estimated ERs for CH 4, CO 2, and N 2 O were 836, 5573, 3. 4 g hd− 1 d− 1 (collectively 27. 5 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) hd− 1 d− 1), respectively, at the dairy operation. The aggregate ERs for CH 4, CO 2, and N 2 O were 3. 8, 1399, 0. 68 g hd− 1 d− 1 (1. 7 kg CO 2 e hd− 1 d− 1), respectively, from the feedyard. The estimated USEPA GHG ERs were about 13. 2 and 1. 16 kg CO 2 e hd− 1 d− 1, respectively, for dairy and feedyard operations. Aggregate CH 4, CO 2 and N 2 O ERs at the dairy facility were about 219, 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than those at the feedyard. At the dairy, average CH 4 ERs estimated from the settling basin, primary and secondary lagoons were significantly higher than those from the other GLAS, contributing about 98 % of the aggregate CH 4 emission. The runoff holding pond and pen surface of the feedyard contributed about 99 % of the aggregate CH 4 emission. Average CO 2 and N 2 O ERs estimated from the pen surface area were significantly higher than those estimated from the compost pile and runoff pond. The pen surface alone contributed about 93 % and 84 % of the aggregate CO 2 and N 2 O emission, respectively. Abatement and management practices that address GHG emissions from these sources will likely be most effective for reducing facility emissions...|$|E

5000|$|Rum Swizzles {{were the}} drink of choice {{at what was}} purportedly the world's first {{cocktail}} party held in London, England in 1924 by novelist Alec Waugh. [...] A reference to a (possibly fictitious) [...] "Green Swizzle" [...] drink dates to 1925 (see [...] "Other Swizzles" [...] below). [...] The Rum Swizzle is also mentioned in Sinclair Lewis's 1925 novel Arrowsmith, which {{is set in the}} fictional Caribbean island of St. Hubert. In 1930, the drink was referenced in a book written by Joseph Hergesheimer, which refers to the drink containing Bacardi rum and bitters, as well as a swizzle stick made of sassafras. The Rum Swizzle was also mentioned in the 1931 autobiographical novel Half a <b>Loaf,</b> <b>penned</b> by Sinclair Lewis's former wife Grace Hegger Lewis about their life together.|$|R
40|$|Flushing dairy facilities, such as milking parlors, holding {{areas and}} free stall alleys, can replace {{mechanical}} scraping or scraping with a tractor and blade. For optimum performance, flushed surfaces are usually sloped at 2 percent to 5 percent {{to provide adequate}} flow velocity for good cleaning and transport. The Missouri State Milk Board requires the milking parlor to be flushed with fresh water, but effluent may be recycled from a lagoon for flushing other {{areas such as the}} holding <b>pen,</b> <b>loafing</b> and feeding areas...|$|R
