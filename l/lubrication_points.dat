The outside cylinders were exchanged for the N1 type, which had been machined at the GWR's Swindon railway works following casting at Ashford to quicken construction once the Nclass frames were modified to accept the new design of cylinder block.

In this type of system, a central pump station automatically delivers lubricant through a single supply line to multiple branches of injectors.

50|$|Another {{revolution}} came in {{the form}} of a stronger reliance on ease of maintenance, which led to standardisation of parts, reductions in the numbers of access panels and <b>lubrication</b> <b>points,</b> and overall parts reduction in more complicated equipment like the engines. Some early jet fighters required 50 man-hours of work by a ground crew for every hour the aircraft was in the air; later models substantially reduced this to allow faster turn-around times and more sorties in a day.

40|$|A {{model of}} cold rolling {{taking into account}} {{lubrication}} in mixed mode was developed. The main objective is to obtain a numerical tool that permits us to optimise a mill configuration from the <b>lubrication</b> <b>point</b> of view. It means that lubricant viscosity but also roll diameter and roughness, rolling diagrams, etc could be modified to improve stability and efficiency of the mill. A modified slab method is solved iteratively and is coupled with a sophisticated tribological model. A general calculation of the modified Reynolds equation is presented in order to evaluate the fluid pressure for any piezoviscosity law. The coupling is made through the calculation of fluid thickness and friction along the roll bite. The evolution of the cylinder/strip contact area due to the asperity crushing along the roll bite is also considered. A parametric study has been undertaken {{in order to determine}} the influence of various process parameters on friction and lubricant flow.

40|$|International audienceMicro-texturing is very {{efficient}} to make surfaces super-hydrophobic {{according to a}} physical process known as 'lotus effect'. In the recent past, tribologists have also investigated surface texturing because {{it could be a}} promising way to increase the lifetime of contacts or to make its working conditions more severe. Moreover, significant friction coefficient reductions have been obtained with textured surfaces in different lubrication regimes. In this presentation, transient lubrication phenomena induced by laser-made circular dimples passing through an elastohydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> <b>point</b> contact are analysed both experimentally and numerically. Under rolling-sliding conditions, the passage of an isolated dimple modifies the film thickness distribution. Deep dimples induce an oil film failure. On the contrary, a shallow dimple locally generates a large increase in the film thickness. Dimples geometry and the slide/roll ratio modify the pressure distribution and then control the level and extension of the local film reinforcement. Experiments are simulated numerically with a two-dimensional multi-grid solver. This allows one to {{have a better understanding of}} the lubrication mechanism with a textured surface as a function of dimple geometry, entrainment speed, and contact pressure. The key point is the control of tribological conditions to maintain the viscosity of the lubricant high enough inside the dimple in order that the shearing can expel it to locally enhance the film thickness...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} condition monitoring {{in the manufacturing}} industry has prompted many {{new developments in the}} area. While some have focused on different ways of processing monitored data, few have touched the subject of the communication network components, protocols, and standards used in monitoring networks. Additionally, monitoring systems have traditionally been built on top of existing network architectures further complicating the factory floor network by introducing additional communication protocols. At the same time, Web Service based solutions have been implemented in the upper levels of the manufacturing industry, namely the corporate network. Proposals implementing Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based approaches that ease the communication exchange for scheduling, ERP and MES systems have been created. While the use of this technology has brought many improvements, the extent of the potential benefits that Web Services can provide have been limited by the scope to which they have been applied to. This thesis proposes a solution that brings the SOA paradigm to the lower levels by utilizing Web-Service embedded intelligent devices. It does so by analyzing the particular case of the lubrication flow monitoring systems used in the paper industry. The fact that the average paper machine requires anything between 600 and 1500 <b>lubrication</b> <b>points</b> presents a unique opportunity to implement a Web Service based system where {{there is a need to}} monitor huge amounts of sensors and flowmeters in a distributed manner. Lastly, this thesis evaluates existing circulating oil flow monitoring architectures, and uses this analysis to propose a potential improvement that brings Web Services to the condition monitoring arena. Tests that evaluate the performance parameters of intelligent Web Service capable devices, and their results are presented. The reliability and overall behavior of the proposed system is analyzed and scrutinized. /Kir 1...|$|E

40|$|Rising {{energy demand}} coupled with {{volatile}} fuel prices has driven {{the automotive industry}} to rebalance focus between durability and efficiency. Originally, the main target was {{the improvement of the}} internal combustion engine. After arriving at certain technological limits, all other drivetrain components were also taken into consideration. In this project, a study on a differential axle has been conducted from a <b>lubrication</b> <b>point</b> of view in order to identify efficiency enhancing routes. Initially, an axle already in production and used on a passenger vehicle was employed and the effect of lubricant viscosity on loss generation was investigated. Additionally, novel lubrication concepts, such as forced-feed lubrication and baffle implementation, were considered and tested on an in-house loss measurement rig. The quantification of loss generation, as well as, the observation of the behaviour of the axle under varying operating conditions was successfully completed. Also, the contribution of each component to overall losses was identified. Furthermore, a theoretical model was built for the prediction of axle efficiency. The model was a transient simulation of the operation of the axle, based on individual component loss generation. The thermal behaviour of the axle was also considered. The model demonstrated good correlation to available data produced from real world measurements. Finally, the benefit of the implementation of previously considered lubrication systems was investigated for the NEDC and Artemis drive cycles. It was found that significant loss reduction over the original axle design can be achieved. Overall axle losses can be reduced by up to 50...|$|R

50|$|The {{probable}} {{explanation for}} this diversity is that snifting valves were useful as long as steam temperatures were relatively low. As locomotive development proceeded, larger superheaters were fitted and steam temperatures increased. When the locomotive was coasting, the air passing from the superheater to the cylinders became so hot that it oxidised the cylinder oil and interfered with <b>lubrication.</b> At this <b>point,</b> most railways decided to abandon snifting valves.|$|R

Conditions equivalent to using solid materials of bronze, steel, and silicon nitride, and lubricants of paraffinic and naphthenic mineral oils are considered in obtaining the exponent on the dimensionless material parameter. Thirty-four different cases are used to generate the fully flooded film thickness formula. A fully flooded condition is said to exist when the inlet distance of the conjunction ceases to influence in any significant way the minimum film thickness. Contour plots are also shown that indicate in detail the pressure spike and two side lobes in which the minimum film thickness occurs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an adaptive {{implementation of a}} high order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the solution of elastohydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> (EHL) <b>point</b> contact problems.

The governing equations are highly nonlinear and include a second order partial differential equation that is derived via the thin-film approximation. Furthermore, the problem features a free boundary, which models where cavitation occurs, and this is automatically captured {{as part of the}} solution process. The need for spatial adaptivity stems from the highly variable length scales that are present in typical solutions.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} numerical {{results for}} the elastohydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> of <b>point</b> contacts where the entrainment velocity is reduced with time. The cases considered correspond to experimental work presented by Glovnea and Spikes [1] for the case where entrainment is reduced to zero with constant deceleration. The experiments modelled involve simple sliding of a steel ball on a glass disk and, due to the poor conductivity of the stationary glass component and the sliding configuration, the temperature is not known with accuracy. The steady state characteristics of the test case, detailed in the experimental result {{for the beginning of}} the transient behaviour, are therefore used to select appropriate values of the lubricant parameters for incorporating in a transient numerical analysis of the test conditions. The paper compares the numerical results obtained using a differential deflection point contact transient analysis with the detailed published experimental film thickness measurements presented by Glovnea et al, and good correlation is shown...|$|R
40|$|The term "sliding bearing" {{refers to}} types of bearing where two {{conformal}} surfaces (usually the stationary bearing and a moving shaft) slide relative {{to one another}} with load distributed directly across the interface. A suitable lubricant may be employed to reduce the friction between these two surfaces. In "fluid film" bearings, this lubricant builds up a layer of sufficient thickness such that the two surfaces are completely separated. Examples include journal and thrust bearings and shaft bushings. Unlike ball or roller bearings which have a limited lifespan, sliding bearings have, at least in theory, an indefinite operational lifespan. As long as an oil film of sufficient thickness is maintained and contamination is avoided, the bearing may continue {{to do its job}} indefinitely. However, more and more onerous demands are being placed on such bearings and their associated methods of lubrication in order to maximise performance in terms of efficiency and load carrying capacity, for example in hydroelectricity generators and turbines. Given the sensitivity of operating any form of mechanical equipment in the vicinity of watercourses, often the source of drinking water for major population centres, the hydropower industry has a duty of responsibility in ensuring that as much as possible is done to minimise the risk of contamination of the water or damage to flora and fauna. Two aims - increased output, decreased environmental impact - are currently the major driving forces behind Research and Development in the hydroelectric power generation industry. Looking at these from a tribological (friction and <b>lubrication)</b> <b>point</b> of view, three areas of particular interest can be identified. These are: 1) How can the load carrying capacity of thrust bearings be increased whilst at the same time improving performance within existing dimensional constraints? 2) What is the influence on bearings of transient events (rapid changes in speed or loading) and what impact do they have on the machinery components? 3) How does the use of Environmentally Adapted Lubricants (as opposed to mineral oils) influence friction and wear etc, specifically with reference to shaft bushings, and what is the impact of fluid ageing (oxidation) on their performance? Each of these three points has been studied {{in the course of the}} work carried out for this thesis. Godkänd; 2005; 20061214 (haneit...|$|R
