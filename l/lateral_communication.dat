40|$|Background: Difficulty in {{controlling}} emotional impulses {{is a crucial}} component of borderline personality disorder (BPD) that often leads to destructive, impulsive behaviors against others. In analogue to recent findings in aggressive samples, deficits in prefrontalamygdala coupling during emotional action control may account for these symptoms. Methods: To study the neurobiological correlates of altered emotional action control in BPD, 30 medication-free, anger-prone, female BPD-patients and 28 age- and intelligence-matched healthy women took part in an Approach-Avoidance task while lying in the MR-scanner. The task required controlling fast behavioral tendencies to approach happy and avoid angry faces. Additionally, saliva testosterone and self-report tendencies to act out anger were collected before the task and correlated with behavioral and fMRI data. Results: BPD-patients reported increased tendencies to act out anger and were faster in approaching than avoiding angry faces compared to healthy women, suggesting deficits in emotional action control in BPD. On a neural level, controlling fast emotional action tendencies was related to enhanced activation in the antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex across groups. Healthy volunteers showed a negative coupling between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right amygdala, whereas this was absent in BPD-patients. Limitations: Specificity of results for BPD and sex differences remain unknown {{due to lack of}} clinical control groups and male participants. Conclusion: The results indicate reduced <b>lateral</b> prefrontal-amygdala <b>communication</b> during emotional action control in anger-prone BPD-patients.

40|$|Although {{construction}} {{is considered to}} be slow in adopting new technology and new processes, innovation, research and development are performed routinely. Nonetheless, knowledge about what affects the diffusion of research results—in the context of innovations—is incomplete, limiting the effectiveness of procedures designed to evaluate project proposals. The aim is to examine the factors that can influence the diffusion of results, in this case from externally funded construction innovation projects. A Fisher's exact test is performed on six concepts derived from general innovation theory which are tested on 20 development projects. The test is used to establish the significance of the six concepts and their applicability to construction-related innovation. The results reveal support for all six concepts, although only four of them attract a high level of significance. External <b>lateral</b> and vertical <b>communication</b> and external integration during the development phase are shown to increase the chances of successful diffusion and should therefore be assessed in project proposals.

5000|$|Since {{the rise}} of {{evolutionary}} psychology, another school of thought, Dual Inheritance Theory, has emerged in the past 25 years that applies the mathematical standards of Population genetics to modeling the adaptive and selective principles of culture. This school of thought was pioneered by Robert Boyd at UCLA and Peter Richerson at UC Davis and expanded by William Wimsatt, among others. Boyd and Richerson’s book, Culture and the Evolutionary Process (1985), was a highly mathematical description of cultural change, later published in a more accessible form in Not by Genes Alone (2004). In Boyd and Richerson’s view, cultural evolution, operating on socially learned information, exists on a separate but co-evolutionary track from genetic evolution, and while the two are related, cultural evolution is more dynamic, rapid, and influential on human society than genetic evolution. Dual Inheritance Theory has the benefit of providing unifying territory for a [...] "nature and nurture" [...] paradigm and accounts for more accurate phenomenon in evolutionary theory applied to culture, such as randomness effects (drift), concentration dependency, [...] "fidelity" [...] of evolving information systems, and <b>lateral</b> transmission through <b>communication.</b>|$|R

However, there are transmission losses in biological tissues due to the presence of water and salts. This Letter focuses on <b>lateral</b> intra-body microwave <b>communication</b> through different biological tissue layers and demonstrates the effect of the tissue thicknesses by comparing signal coupling in the channel. For this work, the authors utilise the R-band frequencies since it overlaps the industrial, scientific and medical radio (ISM) band. The channel model in human tissues is proposed based on electromagnetic simulations, validated using equivalent phantom and ex-vivo measurements. The phantom and ex-vivo measurements are compared with simulation modelling. The results show that electromagnetic communication is feasible in the adipose tissue layer with a low attenuation of approximate to 2 dB per 20 mm for phantom measurements and 4 dB per 20 mm for ex-vivo measurements at 2 GHz. Since the dielectric losses of human adipose tissues are almost half of ex-vivo tissue, an attenuation of around 3 dB per 20 mm is expected.

They display {{thousands}} of epidermal light-producing organs (photophores) that form a diversity of patterns and are primarily controlled by hormones rather than by nerves, the condition in other animals. Various adaptive benefits have been proposed for the light produced by these epidermal organs including camouflage by counterillumination (ventral photophores), intraspecific <b>communication</b> (<b>lateral</b> photophores) and aposematism (dorsal spine-associated photophores). Like other shark species, etmopterids and dalatiids have their skin covered with placoid scales (denticles), which are known to be involved in various tasks including hydrodynamism, protection from predators and ectoparasites and reduction of substrate abrasion. In bioluminescent sharks these denticles have evolved peculiar squamation patterns that are thought to allow photophore accomodation. However, variations in the crown morphology of these structures lead to different degrees of interaction with the photophores and their light emission. Here, we investigated the link between four squamation patterns (internal scales, pavement-like, thorn-like and bristle-like) and several parameters across specimens from 37 shark species (≈ 75 % of current bioluminescent shark diversity) in order to determine if denticle morphology influences photophore organisation and performances. Unexpectedly, pavement-like squamation is linked to higher photophore density and cover (but smaller photophore diameter), and overall photophore performance appears equivalent in external denticles. Future work including optical lithography and computational modelling, will attempt to understand how needle-like denticles, which form a dense external coverage, still allow the delivery of underlying photophore light...|$|R
