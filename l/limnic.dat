25|$|A <b>limnic</b> {{eruption}} {{occurs when}} a gas, usually CO2, suddenly erupts from deep lake water, posing the threat of suffocating wildlife, livestock and humans. Such an eruption may also cause tsunamis in the lake as the rising gas displaces water. Scientists believe landslides, volcanic activity, or explosions can trigger such an eruption. To date, only two <b>limnic</b> eruptions have been observed and recorded. In 1984, in Cameroon, a <b>limnic</b> eruption in Lake Monoun caused the deaths of 37 nearby residents, and at nearby Lake Nyos in 1986 a much larger eruption killed between 1,700 and 1,800 people by asphyxiation.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the event, it is hard to {{determine}} if <b>limnic</b> eruptions have happened elsewhere. A third lake, Lake Kivu, exists on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, and contains massive amounts of dissolved CO2. Sample sediments from the lake were taken by professor Robert Hecky from the University of Michigan, which showed that an event caused living creatures in the lake to go extinct approximately every thousand years, and caused nearby vegetation to be swept back into the lake. <b>Limnic</b> eruptions can be measured on a scale using the concentration of CO2 in the surrounding area.|$|E

25|$|Scientists have {{recently}} determined, from {{investigations into the}} mass casualties in the 1980s at Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos, that although <b>limnic</b> eruptions can be indirectly related to volcanic eruptions, they are actually separate types of disaster events.|$|E
25|$|Being a {{small group}} with only 30 species {{worldwide}} known in 2010, and 32 species described in 2011, and 33 in 2012 (+9 undescribed Pontohedyle species), these slugs are morphologically and biologically highly aberrant and diverse, comprising a series of unusual characters (e.g. secondary gonochorism, lack of copulatory organs, asymmetric radulae). Most acochlidians live interstitially in marine sands, while some have conquered <b>limnic</b> systems (uniquely within opisthobranch gastropods).|$|E
25|$|A multi-locus {{molecular}} {{study by}} Jörger et al. (2010), included {{six out of}} seven acochlidian families. It confirmed Acochlidiacea in a pulmonate relationship, as sister to Eupulmonata. Euthyneura, Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata as traditionally defined were found non-monophyletic. The enigmatic amphibious and insectivorous Aitengidae clusters within Acochlidiacea, as sister to meiofaunal and brackish Pseudunelidae and <b>limnic</b> Acochlidiidae. Inclusion of this small acochlidian group resulted in redefinition of major groups within Heterobranchia, {{that has led to}} creation of the new clades Euopisthobranchia and Panpulmonata.|$|E
25|$|Lake Kivu is a {{fresh water}} lake and, along with Cameroonian Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun, {{is one of}} three that are known to undergo <b>limnic</b> eruptions. Around the lake, geologists found {{evidence}} of massive biological extinctions about every thousand years, presumably caused by outgassing events. The trigger for lake overturns is unknown in Lake Kivu's case, but volcanic activity is suspected. The gaseous chemical composition of exploding lakes is unique to each lake, in Lake Kivu's case, methane and carbon dioxide due to lake water interaction with a volcano.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the surface}} water of deep {{tropical}} lakes never reaches {{the temperature of}} maximum density, there is no process that makes the water mix. The deeper layer becomes oxygen starved and can become saturated with carbon dioxide, or other gases such as sulfur dioxide if {{there is even a}} trace of volcanic activity. Exceptional events, such as earthquakes or landslides, can cause mixing which rapidly brings the deep layers up to the surface and release a vast cloud of gas which lay trapped in solution in the colder water {{at the bottom of the}} lake. This is called a <b>limnic</b> eruption. An example is the disaster at Lake Nyos in Cameroon. The amount of gas that can be dissolved in water is directly related to pressure. As deep water surfaces, the pressure drops and a vast amount of gas comes out of solution. Under these circumstances carbon dioxide is hazardous because it is heavier than air and displaces it, so it may flow down a river valley to human settlements and cause mass asphyxiation.|$|E
500|$|Most {{oil shale}} {{formations}} {{took place during}} mid-Cambrian, early and middle Ordovician, late Devonian, late Jurassic and Paleogene periods. These were formed by the deposition of organic matter {{in a variety of}} depositional environments including freshwater to highly saline lakes, epicontinental marine basins and subtidal shelves and were restricted to estuarine areas such as oxbow lakes, peat bogs, <b>limnic</b> and coastal swamps, and muskegs. When plants die in such an anaerobic aquatic environment, low oxygen levels prevent their complete bacterial decay.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>limnic</b> eruption, also {{referred}} to as a lake overturn, is a rare type of natural disaster in which dissolved carbon dioxide (...) suddenly erupts from deep lake waters, forming a gas cloud that can suffocate wildlife, livestock, and humans. Such an eruption may also cause tsunamis in the lake as the rising [...] displaces water. [...] Scientists believe earthquakes, volcanic activity, or explosions can be a trigger for such phenomenon. Lakes in which such activity occurs may be known as limnically active lakes or exploding lakes. Some features of limnically active lakes include: ...|$|E
2500|$|Colymboides, {{the oldest}} unequivocal gaviiform genus known as of 2009, is widely known from early Priabonian – about 37 {{million years ago}} (Ma) in the Late Eocene – to Early Miocene (late Burdigalian, less than 20 Ma) <b>limnic</b> and marine rocks of western Eurasia north of the Alpide belt, between the Atlantic and the former Turgai Sea. It is usually placed in the Gaviidae already, but usually in a {{subfamily}} Colymboidinae, with the modern-type loons making up the Gaviinae. But the Colymboides material is generally quite distinct from modern loons, and may actually belong in a now-extinct family of primitive gaviiforms.|$|E
2500|$|... yet; if {{the water}} were to become heavily saturated, it could become an even greater risk to human and animal life. Two main changes in Lake Kivu's {{physical}} state that have brought attention to the possible <b>limnic</b> eruption are the high rates of methane dissociation and the rising surface temperature. Thorough research of historical and present temperature monitoring show that Lake Kivu's surface temperature is increasing by approximately 0.12°C per decade. It is located very close to a potential trigger, Mount Nyiragongo, an active volcano that erupted in January 2002, in an active earthquake zone and close to other active volcanoes.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the lake}} could be {{degassed}} {{in a manner}} similar to Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos, due to the size of the lake and the volume of gas involved such an operation would be expensive, running into millions of dollars. A scheme initiated in 2010 to utilize methane trapped in the lake as a fuel source to generate electricity in Rwanda has led to a degree of CO2 degassing. [...] During the procedure for extracting the flammable gas used to fuel power stations on the shore, some CO2 is removed in a process known as catalyst scrubbing. It is unclear whether enough of the gas will be removed to eliminate the danger of a <b>limnic</b> eruption at Lake Kivu.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{a sudden}} {{outgassing}} of [...] had occurred at Lake Monoun in 1984, a similar threat from Lake Nyos was not anticipated. However, on August 21, 1986, a <b>limnic</b> eruption occurred at Lake Nyos, triggering the sudden release of about 100,000–300,000 tons (some sources state {{as much as}} 1.6 million tons) of [...] This gas cloud rose at nearly [...] and spilled over the northern lip of the lake into a valley running roughly east-west from Cha to Subum. It then rushed down two valleys branching off to the north, displacing all {{of the air and}} suffocating 1,746people within [...] of the lake, mostly rural villagers, as well as 3,500 livestock. The villages most affected were Cha, Nyos, and Subum.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the lake}} is {{saturated}} with CO2, it is very unstable. A trigger {{is all that is}} needed to set off an eruption. [...] In the case of the 1986 eruption at Lake Nyos, landslides were the suspected triggers, but an actual volcanic eruption, an earthquake, or even wind and rain storms are other possible triggers. Another possible cause of a <b>limnic</b> eruption is the gradual development of saturation at certain depths which can trigger the spontaneous development of gas. In any case, the trigger pushes some of the saturated water higher in the lake, where the pressure is insufficient to keep the CO2 in solution. [...] Bubbles start forming and the water is lifted even higher in the lake (buoyancy), where even more of the CO2 comes out of solution. [...] This process forms a column of gas. [...] At this point the water at the bottom of this column is pulled up by suction, and it too loses its CO2 in a runaway process. [...] This eruption pours CO2 into the air and can also displace water to form a tsunami.|$|E
2500|$|For a <b>limnic</b> {{eruption}} to occur, {{the lake}} must be nearly saturated with gas. [...] In the two known cases, the major component was CO2; however, in Lake Kivu, scientists {{are concerned about}} the concentrations of methane gas as well. [...] This CO2 may come from volcanic gas emitted from under the lake or from decomposition of organic material. [...] Before a lake is saturated, it behaves like an unopened carbonated beverage (soft drink): the CO2 is dissolved in the water. [...] In both the lake and the soft drink, CO2 dissolves much more readily at higher pressure (Henry's law). This is why bubbles in a can of soda form only after the can is opened; the pressure is released and the CO2 comes out of solution. [...] In the case of lakes, the bottom is at a much higher pressure; the deeper it is, the higher the pressure at the bottom. [...] This means that huge amounts of CO2 can be dissolved in large, deep lakes. [...] Also, CO2 dissolves more readily in cooler water, such as that {{at the bottom of a}} lake. [...] A small rise in water temperature can lead to the release of a large amount of CO2.|$|E

50|$|Lake Kivu is one {{of three}} lakes in Africa {{identified}} as having huge quantities of dissolved gas held at pressure in its depths.

Lake Nyos overturn was particularly lethal, killing nearly two thousand people in the area around the lake. Kivu is 2,000 times bigger than Lake Nyos and also contains dissolved methane as an additional hazard - though concentration of carbon dioxide is much lower than in Lake Nyos. Nearly two million people, including the population of Goma, live in the vicinity of Lake Kivu and could be in danger from a <b>limnic</b> eruption triggered by one of the nearby volcanoes and the earthquakes associated with them.|$|E
