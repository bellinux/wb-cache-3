5|$|Memling's style {{does not}} <b>lend</b> <b>itself</b> well to {{assigning}} dates, making a determination difficult. According to Stirling, an earlier date is easily accepted, especially because of stylistic similarities to Memling's 1479 St John Altarpiece, whereas Ainsworth leans toward the later date as more {{in keeping with}} the mature style of the late 1480s.|$|E

5|$|Many {{writers in}} the early 20th century perpetuated a myth that Thespis ran only a month and was {{considered}} a failure. In fact, it remained open until 8 March. Of the nine London pantomimes that appeared during the 1871–72 holiday season, five closed before Thespis did. By its nature, the genre did not <b>lend</b> <b>itself</b> to long runs, and all nine had closed {{by the end of}} March. Moreover, the Gaiety normally only ran productions for two or three weeks; the run of Thespis was extraordinary for the theatre.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{a debate}} between {{scholars}} over when the book was actually published. One school of thought favors a political interpretation which <b>lends</b> <b>itself</b> to a later publication after {{the founding of the}} Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). The second favors a religious interpretation which <b>lends</b> <b>itself</b> to an earlier publication during the late Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).|$|R

5|$|Cross-lingual {{studies were}} {{performed}} at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek (the {{only one with}} a non-Roman alphabet), Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. Because the original yoked design did not <b>lend</b> <b>itself</b> well to long-distance research and standardization, it {{was replaced by a}} simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.|$|E
5|$|In November 2015, Dream Theater {{announced}} some European tour {{dates for}} early 2016. The next month, they announced North American tour dates beginning in April and ending in May. As the band felt that The Astonishing would <b>lend</b> <b>itself</b> well to a live performance, {{they decided to}} play the album in full for each show and hired a production company to help with their presentation. They also {{made it a point}} to book historical concert halls and theaters such as Radio City Music Hall. Following the conclusion of the North American leg, the band moved on to South America before returning to the United States for another run of shows, officially wrapping up the tour in December 2016.|$|E
5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and, by extension, the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc spot welding, thereby replacing riveting or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc welding is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not <b>lend</b> <b>itself</b> to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, or gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E

5|$|Notable mainstays in {{the live}} {{experience}} of the sound are MC Sgt Pokes and MC Crazy D from London, and Juakali from Trinidad. Production in a studio environment seems to <b>lend</b> <b>itself</b> to more experimentation. Kode9 has collaborated extensively with the Spaceape, who MCs in a dread poet style. Kevin Martin's experiments with the genre are almost exclusively collaborations with MCs such as Warrior Queen, Flowdan, and Tippa Irie. Skream has also featured Warrior Queen and grime artist JME on his debut album, Skream!. Plastician, {{who was one of}} the first DJ's to mix the sound of grime and dubstep together, has worked with notable grime setup Boy Better Know as well as renowned Grime MC's such as Wiley, Dizzee Rascal and Lethal Bizzle. He has also released tracks with a dubstep foundation and grime verses over the beats. Dubstep artist and label co-owner Sam Shackleton has moved toward productions which fall outside the usual dubstep tempo, and sometimes entirely lack most of the common tropes of the genre.|$|E
5|$|In Bačka and Baranja, the Volksdeutsche and Hungarian {{authorities}} killed {{significant numbers}} of Serbs. After small-scale armed resistance broke out in Hungarian-occupied Bačka and Baranja {{in the second half}} of 1941, the Hungarian military reacted with heavy repressive measures. In September 1941 alone the Hungarian occupation forces summarily executed 313 people. Measures included the establishment of temporary concentration camps at Ada, Bačka Topola, Begeč, Odžaci, Bečej and Subotica, as well as at Novi Sad, Pechuj and Baja. According to Professor Paul Mojzes, some 2,000 Jews and a large number of Serbs were detained in these camps for periods from two weeks to two months, with Jews that had not been interned being employed as forced labourers. Several thousand people remained in camps until the end of the war. Some of the Jews that had migrated to Bačka and Baranja during the inter-war period were expelled to the NDH or the German-occupied territory of Serbia where they were killed. The communist-led Partisan resistance movement of Josip Broz Tito was never strong in Bačka and Baranja because the flat terrain of the region did not <b>lend</b> <b>itself</b> to guerilla warfare, and because South Slavs, from which the Partisans drew their recruits, only made up one-third of the regional population. Some Partisan units raised in the occupied territories were sent to the NDH to reinforce Partisan formations operating there. Despite their initial resistance, the Chetnik movement was largely inactive during the occupation, maintaining some covert activity only. The Partisans and their regional committee had largely been destroyed by the end of 1941.|$|E

25|$|The {{assault on}} Urgench {{proved to be}} the most {{difficult}} battle of the Mongol invasion. The city was built along the river Amu Darya in a marshy delta area. The soft ground did not <b>lend</b> <b>itself</b> to siege warfare, and {{there was a lack of}} large stones for the catapults. The Mongols attacked regardless, and the city fell only after the defenders put up a stout defense, fighting block for block. Mongolian casualties were higher than normal, due to the unaccustomed difficulty of adapting Mongolian tactics to city fighting.|$|E
