5|$|From June 1967, <b>Line</b> <b>9,</b> {{that ran}} along the Lilleaker Line via the Skøyen Line to the city center and onwards along the Østensjø Line, was {{truncated}} to Jernbanetorget, as the Østensjø was converted to a metro line. Calculations showed that if the Lilleaker Line or the Skøyen Line and the Ekeberg Line were connected, between them one tram less would be needed, and the Ekeberg Line would have a service through the city center. After trial runs, the new service to Skøyen was taken into use on 4 May 1969.|$|E
5|$|The first Norwegian-built tram was {{delivered}} on 16 February 1983 {{and put into}} service on 9 March. The last unit was put into service on 10 January 1984. The Strømmen trams were numbered 111 through 125. There were few problems in the start, although the pantographs had technical problems and there were occasional power failures in the overhead wires due to out-of-date rectifiers {{not being able to}} handle the increase power usage. Trams no. 101 through 113 were put into service on <b>Line</b> <b>9</b> on the Lilleaker Line and the Ekeberg Line, replacing the Class E. The remaining trams of the first series were put into service on Line 1, on the Sinsen Line and the Briskeby Line, as well as Line 7, on the Ullevål Hageby Line and the Sinsen Line. On <b>Line</b> <b>9,</b> that included both the tramway's light rail sections, only SL79-trams were used, while lines 1 and 7 used a mix of SL79 and SM53-trams.|$|E

5|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} connected to Egertorget via Stortorvet. After {{the line was}} taken over by KSS, it was given service number 9 and operated with a twelve-minute headway, connecting via the city center to Skøyen on the Skøyen Line. When the Sinsen Line opened, the souther part of the Rodeløkka was also served by Line 13, which gave a six-minute headway south of Helgesens gate. From 29 June 1924, after the takeover of Oslo Sporveier, the headway was changed to fifteen minutes. From 29 May 1927, Line 13 was replaced with Line 12, and from 19 June, <b>Line</b> <b>9</b> became Line 17, which continued along the Ullevål Hageby Line {{on the other side of}} the city center. From 19 January 1937, the Sinsen service was also operated by Line 3. From 10 December 1939, Gullfisk trams were put into service on the Sinsen services. With the reopening of the Rodeløkka Line in 1955, the service {{was taken over by}} Line 13, which used SM53 trams. Ridership on the new line was less than predicted, and from 1959, the line was only served during rush-hour and started to turn at the Eastern Railway Station in the city center.|$|E

25|$|The routes {{were changed}} in 1902, so the Sagene {{services}} {{connected to the}} Rodeløkka Line and the St. Hanshaugen services connected to the Vippetangen Line. KKS was sold to KSS on 6 October 1905, who took over services on the Sagene Line. They rerouted the services and at first tied the Sagene services to the Kampen Line. Lines were numbered in 1910. Thus the Sagene service was linked with the Vålerenga Line and numbered 8, while the St. Hanshaugen was tied to the Rodeløkka Line and numbered 9. This was reorganized two years later, when <b>line</b> <b>9</b> was removed and all services ran to Sagene.|$|E
25|$|To cut costs, Oslo Sporveier {{considered}} {{during the}} late 1960s if it could introduce one-man operation and abolish the conductor during off-peak hours. This would require a redesign of the interior. Inspiration was gathered from the Hamburg Tramway and unit 206 was rebuilt in 1970. However, the labor unions were opposed to the change, fearing for their jobs, and succeeded at vetoing the change. From 1971 one-man operations were introduced by Bærumsbanen on their Gullfisk units, creating a certain precedence for future conversion. From 29 September 1974 the Lilleaker and Ekeberg Lines were combined as <b>Line</b> <b>9,</b> and all available Gullfisk were moved there. Thus all street tram services were being served with SM53. However, there were soon a lack of Gullfisk, resulting {{in some of the}} Høka trams reentering service on the suburban lines.|$|E

On 1 May 2011, the line was further extended westwards by 3 stations, bringing it to its current length of 52.8km. The Tram line in the system, the TEDA Modern Guided Rail Tram, was built to serve the Tianjin Economic Development Area and was opened on 10 May 2007. Line 2, after a lengthy construction delay and a structural accident, finally opened, as two separate sections, to the public on 1 July 2012, with the sections being reconnected on 28 August 2013.
