5|$|The Sm ion is a {{potential}} activator for use in warm-white <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diodes. It offers high luminous efficacy due to the narrow emission bands, however, the generally low quantum efficiency and insufficient absorption in the UV-A to blue spectral region hinders commercial application.|$|E
5|$|The {{screen on}} the Executive was a {{monolithic}} seven-segment gallium arsenide <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode display, bought from a Canadian firm.

5|$|The {{trivalent}} dysprosium ion (Dy3+) {{has been}} studied due its downshifting luminescence properties. Dy-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Dy) excited in the ultraviolet region {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} results in the emission of photons of longer wavelength in the visible region. This idea is the basis {{for a new generation of}} UV-pumped white <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diodes.|$|E

5|$|In evolution, luciferins {{generally}} vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is the <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> pigment {{for nine}} ancient phyla (groups of very different organisms), including polycystine radiolaria, Cercozoa (Phaeodaria), protozoa, comb jellies, cnidaria including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and vertebrates (ray-finned fish). Not all these organisms synthesize coelenterazine: {{some of them}} obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferase enzymes vary widely and tend to be different in each species. Overall, bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorus {{could be}} {{intentionally}} introduced into diamond grown by {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) at concentrations up to ~0.01%. Phosphorus substitutes carbon in the diamond lattice. Similar to nitrogen, phosphorus has one more electron than carbon and thus acts as a donor; however, the ionization energy of phosphorus (0.6 eV) is much smaller than that of nitrogen (1.7 eV) and is small enough for room-temperature thermal ionization. This important property of phosphorus in diamond favors electronic applications, such as UV <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diodes (LEDs, at 235nm).|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani has an {{estimated}} mass of 0.82 solar masses and a radius of 0.74 solar radii. It shines with a luminosity of only 0.34 solar luminosities. The estimated effective temperature is 5,084K. With a stellar classification of K2V, {{it is the}} second-nearest K-type main-sequence star (after Alpha Centauri B). Since 1943 the spectrum of Epsilon Eridani has served {{as one of the}} stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. Its metallicity, the fraction of elements heavier than helium, is slightly lower than the Sun's. In Epsilon Eridani's chromosphere, a region of the outer atmosphere just above the <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> photosphere, the abundance of iron is estimated at 74% of the Sun's value. The proportion of lithium in the atmosphere is five times less than that in the Sun.|$|E

5|$|ZnO has wide direct {{band gap}} (3.37 eV or 375nm at room temperature). Therefore, its most common {{potential}} applications are in laser diodes and <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diodes (LEDs). Some optoelectronic applications of ZnO overlap with that of GaN, which has a similar bandgap (~3.4 eV at room temperature). Compared to GaN, ZnO has a larger exciton binding energy (~60 meV, 2.4 times of the room-temperature thermal energy), which results in bright room-temperature emission from ZnO. ZnO can be combined with GaN for LED-applications. For instance as transparent conducting oxide layer and ZnO nanostructures provide better light outcoupling. Other properties of ZnO favorable for electronic applications include its stability to high-energy radiation and its possibility to be patterned by wet chemical etching. Radiation resistance makes ZnO a suitable candidate for space applications. ZnO is the most promising candidate {{in the field of}} random lasers to produce an electronically pumped UV laser source.|$|E

25|$|From {{as early}} as 1888 {{electric-powered}} bicycle lamps were manufactured but did not become a viable proposition until 1898.
