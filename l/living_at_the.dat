5|$|After Barrington {{suffered}} a paralytic stroke in early 1919, {{he was unable}} to perform. He spent {{the rest of his life}} in poverty, although his fellow actors held benefits and made other efforts to help him, and his brothers and his neighbors in East Hagbourne, Berkshire, helped him as he became increasingly disabled and eventually unable even to speak. He died in 1922 while <b>living</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> St. James's Infirmary, Balham, in South London, at the age of 69 and is buried in Lower Morden Lane at the Morden Cemetery, also known as Battersea New Cemetery, in Surrey. On the 75th anniversary of Barrington's death, a granite monument with a photoplaque of Barrington as Pooh-Bah was dedicated to him at the Morden Cemetery, by members of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society, the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society and others.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as a}} fencing and archery enthusiast, Parsons {{was also}} a keen shooter; he often hunted jack rabbits and cotton tails in the desert, and was amused by mock dueling with Forman while on test sites with rifles and shotguns. Upon proposing to his first wife Helen, he gifted her a pistol. Parsons enjoyed playing pranks on his colleagues, often through detonating {{explosives}} such as firecrackers and smoke bombs, and was known to spend {{hours at a time}} in the bathtub playing with toy boats while <b>living</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Parsonage.|$|E

5|$|Carli {{went on to}} {{make two}} more films {{starring}} Krohn. The first, Sarinah (1931), was a romance set on the south coast of Java which had Krohn in the titular role. The second, Karina's Zelfopoffering (Karina's Sacrifice), followed the following year; this film saw Krohn play a mixed-raced woman <b>living</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> palace in the Sultanate of Yogyakarta. Karina's Zelfopoffering was a commercial failure and Carli left the Indies not long afterwards, moving to the Netherlands. He lived there {{until his death in}} 1972.|$|E
5|$|Compromised as a {{reporter}} by her personal relationship with Roosevelt, Hickok left the AP and began work as the chief investigator for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), a department of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. Hickok encouraged or inspired several of Eleanor Roosevelt's initiatives, including her syndicated column, her all-women press conferences, and her planned community at Arthurdale, West Virginia. As Hickok grew more demanding of the First Lady, however, the pair's initial closeness lessened. Following complications with her diabetes, Hickok resigned from FERA in 1936 and worked for three years promoting the 1939 New York World's Fair. From 1940 to 1945, she served as the executive secretary of the Women's Division of the Democratic National Committee, <b>living</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> White House {{for most of this}} time. As her diabetes steadily worsened, she lived out her final years at Hyde Park to be near Roosevelt, publishing several books.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the stylistic}} {{innovations}} Radama adopted {{for the construction}} of several of the compound's buildings, the Rova largely retained its traditional features during his reign. The basic layout of the compound remained largely unaltered from its original design with the sole exception of an expansion of the Rova along its north-south axis. Stone walls topped with sharpened wooden stakes were built around the new perimeter during this period. Venerable buildings such as Besakana, Nanjakana, Mahitsy and Manjakamiadana were retained, as were the houses of several of Andrianampoinimerina's wives, many of whom were still <b>living</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of Radama's death in 1828. During his reign, Radama undertook the restoration of Marivolanitra to serve chiefly as housing for visiting foreigners, and briefly inhabited it himself in addition to his main residence at Besakana. He also had a house called Kelisoa ("Petite Beauty") built as a lodging for his concubines.|$|E

5|$|Due to the band's slow progress, Shields {{contemplated}} relocating to New York City, {{where members}} of his family were <b>living</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. However, Creation Records co-founder Joe Foster had decided to establish his own record label, Kaleidoscope Sound and persuaded My Bloody Valentine to record and release an EP. The New Record by My Bloody Valentine, produced by Foster, was released in October 1986 and was a minor success, peaking at number 22 on the UK Indie Chart upon its release. On the strength of the release, the band began performing more frequent shows, later developing a small following and travelling outside London for live performances, supporting and opening for bands such as The Membranes.|$|E
5|$|Films of {{the time}} {{typically}} used dinosaurs as monsters, with the added element of atomic fears in the early Cold War. Thus, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953) and Godzilla (1954; American release 1956) portray monstrous dinosaur-like prehistoric reptiles that go on rampages after being awakened by atomic bomb tests. An alternative appears in Disney's animated Fantasia (1940), in its The Rite of Spring sequence, which attempted to portray dinosaurs with some scientific accuracy (although it has the common error of showing prehistoric animals from many different time periods <b>living</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time) and also in Karel Zeman's Cesta do praveku (1955;Journey to the Beginning of Time) Czechoslovakian children's science fiction movie inspired by Zdeněk Burian's work.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his divorce}} from Rosamunde, Gibbs married {{for a third}} time. He wed Doris Mannix at St Matthew’s Church of England in Bondi on 9 September 1948. In 1971, owing to the decline in status and {{significance}} of the Albert Medal, the British Government announced that the decoration would be abolished and living recipients would henceforth be regarded as holders of the George Cross. The change came into effect from 21 October, and living recipients were accordingly invited to exchange their medals. All six Australian Albert Medal recipients <b>living</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time opted to accept the offer, Gibbs and four others travelling to London to receive their awards. The five men, Jack Chalmers, Robert Kavanaugh, William McAloney, Dick Richards and Gibbs, were presented with their George Crosses by Queen Elizabeth II in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 12 July 1972.|$|E

5|$|Higham theorises that Gregory {{believed}} {{that the end of}} the world was imminent, and that he was destined to be a major part of God's plan for the apocalypse. His belief was rooted in the idea that the world would go through six ages, and that he was <b>living</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the sixth age, a notion that may have played a part in Gregory's decision to dispatch the mission. Gregory not only targeted the British with his missionary efforts, but he also supported other missionary endeavours, encouraging bishops and kings to work together for the conversion of non-Christians within their territories. He urged the conversion of the heretical Arians in Italy and elsewhere, as well as the conversion of Jews. Also pagans in Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica were the subject of letters to officials, urging their conversion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the church}} are bronze plaques commemorating the eleven local {{people who died}} in World War I and the six {{who were killed in}} World War II. There is also a stained glass window showing a saint with a sword {{standing}} on a snake, and crossed flags commemorating those from World War II. There is also a memorial plaque to the local Bilbie family of bell founders and clockmakers inside the church, and just inside the porch, on the left of the church door, is a stone figure holding an anchor, which was moved to the church from Walley Court with the flooding of the lake. There is an unconfirmed story that this was given to the Gilbert family, then <b>living</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> court, by Queen ElizabethI.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot {{begins in}} June 1819, {{following}} Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, after the House of Bourbon had been {{restored to the}} throne of France. Tension was mounting between the aristocracy, which had returned with King Louis XVIII, and the bourgeoisie produced by the Industrial Revolution. During this era, France saw a tightening of social structures, with a lower class steeped in overwhelming poverty. By one estimate, almost three-quarters of Parisians {{did not make the}} 500–600 francs a year required for a minimal standard of <b>living.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, this upheaval made possible a social mobility unthinkable during the Ancien Régime of previous centuries. Individuals willing to adapt themselves to the rules of this new society could sometimes ascend into its upper echelons from modest backgrounds, much to the distaste of the established wealthy class.|$|E

50|$|He was satirised by the royalists as {{a notorious}} pluralist, {{but there is}} no proof that he enjoyed all his <b>livings</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time. John Wilkins {{describes}} him {{as one of the most}} eminent divines for preaching and practical theology. He published a large number of separate sermons. The chief authority is a eulogistic life by a friend, William Durham, Harris's kinsman and minister of Tredington.|$|R

5|$|Mengele's {{name was}} {{mentioned}} {{several times during}} the Nuremberg trials, but Allied forces were convinced that he was dead. Irene and the family in Günzburg also said that he was dead. Working in West Germany, Nazi hunters Simon Wiesenthal and Hermann Langbein collected information from witnesses as to Mengele's wartime activities. In a search of the public records, Langbein found Mengele's divorce papers listing an address in Buenos Aires. He and Wiesenthal pressured West German authorities into drawing up an arrest warrant on 5 June 1959, and starting extradition proceedings. Initially Argentina turned down the request, because the fugitive was no longer <b>living</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> address given on the documents. By the time extradition was approved on 30 June 1960, Mengele had already fled to Paraguay, where he was living on a farm near the Argentine border.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, unusual environments may {{preserve}} soft tissues. These lagerstätten allow paleontologists {{to examine}} the internal anatomy of animals that in other sediments are represented only by shells, spines, claws, etc. – if they are preserved at all. However, even lagerstätten present an incomplete picture of life at the time. The majority of organisms <b>living</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time are probably not represented because lagerstätten are restricted to a narrow range of environments, e.g. where soft-bodied organisms can be preserved very quickly by events such as mudslides; and the exceptional events that cause quick burial {{make it difficult to}} study the normal environments of the animals. The sparseness of the fossil record means that organisms are expected to exist long before and after they are found in the fossil record– this is known as the Signor-Lipps effect.|$|E
