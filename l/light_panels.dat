25|$|Frankston {{also has}} over 50 sculptures in public places. Most are located around the Frankston Central Business District (CBD) {{and at the}} Frankston Waterfront. Larger {{additions}} are Sentinel, a 5-metre wooden sculpture inspired by the deity eaglehawk spirit Bunjil (from the Indigenous Australian Dreamtime mythology) on Young Street by artist Bruce Armstrong; The Power of Community in Beauty Park by mosaic artist Deborah Halpern; Sightlines along Frankston Pier by installation artist Louise Laverack, which consists of 22 nautical flag-themed weather vanes and <b>light</b> <b>panels</b> that reflect {{the movement of the}} waves below; and a life-size bronze statue of Dame Elisabeth Murdoch by sculptor Peter Corlett in the foyer of the Frankston Arts Centre.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} is also surfaced in Carrara marble. It divides into three sections: {{the main hall}} with adjoining smaller exhibition halls, the theatre and {{the offices of the}} Insituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. The main hall is covered by the Marotti glass and iron roof. It and the balconies of all three upper floors {{can be seen from the}} ground floor below. In areas of the main hall, pre-Hispanic motifs done in Art Deco style, such as serpents’ heads on window arches and Maya Chaac masks on the vertical <b>light</b> <b>panels</b> distinguish this interior from its contemporaries. The smaller exhibition halls are located on the first and second floors. The first floor is decorated with crystal lamps, created by Edgar Brandt and hold murals by Rufino Tamayo. The Adamo Boari and Manuel M. Ponce halls hold music and literature events. And the National and International halls are for exhibitions. The second floor has smaller exhibition halls as well as murals by José Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Diego Rivera, Jorge González Camarena, Roberto Montenegro and Manuel Rodríguez Lozano. The third floor is occupied by the Museum of Architecture. The ironwork was designed in Italy by Alessandro Mazzucotelli and in Mexico by Luis Romero Soto.|$|E
2500|$|The circuit {{underwent}} changes {{following the}} previous year's race. At {{the request of}} motorcycling's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme, some sections of turn ten's asphalt run-off area were replaced by gravel and some <b>light</b> <b>panels</b> were mounted closer to the ground for improved visibility. Tyre supplier Pirelli brought two types of tyre to the race: two dry compounds (soft [...] "options", and medium [...] "primes"), {{as opposed to the}} previous two meetings in Austin where the Hard and Medium compounds were selected. The soft tyres were identified by a white stripe on their side-walls, and the medium tyres were similarly identified in yellow. The event's official name was the 2014 Formula 1 United States Grand Prix.|$|E

40|$|Prototype <b>lighting</b> <b>panels</b> and luminaires were {{fabricated}} using DuPont Displaysâ solution-processed small-molecule OLED technology. These <b>lighting</b> <b>panels</b> {{were based}} on a spatially-patterned, 3 -color design, similar in concept to an OLED display panel, with materials chosen to maximize device efficacy. The majority of the processing steps take place in air (rather than high vacuum). Optimization of device architecture, processing and construction was undertaken, with a final prototype design of 50 cm{sup 2 } being fabricated and tested. Performance of these panels reached 35 lm/W at illuminant-A. A unique feature of this technology is the ability to color tune the emission, and color temperatures ranging from 2700 to > 6, 500 K were attained in the final build. Significant attention was paid to low-cost fabrication techniques...|$|R

50|$|Light-emitting diode (LED) {{technology}} is frequently used in signs. This technology, first used primarily at sporting events, later appeared at businesses, churches, schools, and government buildings. Brightness of LED signs can vary, leading to some municipalities in the United States banning their use due to {{issues such as}} light pollution. Today, LED {{technology is}} also used in <b>light</b> <b>panels</b> to illuminate advertising graphics in public places including malls, subways, and airports.|$|E

50|$|Following World War II, a six-room {{addition}} {{was designed}} by architect R. Thibault. In 1967, the St. Matthew Schoolbuilding was torn down. E. J. Cuhaci was the architect for the new north wing and gymnasium of the school. In 1977, Corpus Christi Catholic School held its 50th anniversary celebration. John Tappin worked with the students to sculpt fibreglass totem panels which were mounted on the new <b>light</b> <b>panels,</b> in the main hall of the school.|$|E

The cost {{of the house and}} site was $55,000.00, a large sum in 1908. The Boyntons lived in the house until 1918.|$|E
50|$|Extensive {{alterations}} to {{the building}} in 1927-28 saw the demolition of the original back wall {{and the addition of}} a reinforced concrete and steel extension. At the same time the interior of the first floor was remodelled. A panelled, arched ceiling to the rear half of this floor is decorated in modelled fibrous plaster with angels, harps and Australian floral motifs in gold relief. The walls are panelled in silky oak; the floor is hardwood. Lead <b>light</b> <b>panels</b> in the ceiling and one end wall depict the four counties of Ireland and the Queensland coat of arms, while other leadlight windows are located in the north- east side wall.|$|E
40|$|Our urban visual {{world is}} overflooded with {{messages}} mostly coming from advertisers and public officials. The information is pushed to our consciousness without {{giving us a}} chance to reply. No real dialogue takes place. I {{would like to see a}} change in this and bring more possibilities for interaction into our shared and public spaces. In my thesis I review the research on public display design and map the context by looking at the history of public space. Design models and methods are introduced to overcome the shortcomings of traditional human-computer interaction design. However, the focus of the work is on a production: the Dotted Landscape <b>light</b> <b>panel</b> that allows remote controlling through a web user interface.

40|$|A novel OLED (organic light {{emitting}} diode) <b>lighting</b> <b>panel,</b> {{which uses a}} special layout design, can reduce the photolithography cycles and process costs and is more reliable. It only needs two steps of photolithography cycles, which include an ITO (InSnO compound transparent oxide) pattern and insulator pattern. There {{is no need for}} the metal bus pattern of the ordinary design. The OLED device structure is a type of red–green–blue (RGB) -stacked emitting layer that has a good color index and greater adjustability, which improves the performance of the device. This novel design has the same equipment and material requirement compared to the ordinary design, and it is very beneficial in terms of high volume and low-cost production. It uses a hyper driving method because the entire OLED <b>lighting</b> <b>panel</b> is divided into many sub-emitting units; if one of the sub-emitting units is burned out, it has no effect on the adjacent sub-emitting unit, so the reliability is markedly better than the ordinary design...|$|R
