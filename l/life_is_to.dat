SpongeBob's {{unlimited}} optimistic cheer often leads him to perceive the outcome of numerous endeavors and the personalities of those around him as happier than they actually are; for instance, he believes that Squidward enjoys his company {{in spite of the}} fact that he clearly loathes him. SpongeBob's greatest goal in <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> receive his driver's license from Mrs. Puff's boat driving school, but he panics and crashes whenever he is in a boat. He lives in a submerged pineapple with his pet snail Gary.|$|E

25|$|In monist Advaita Vedanta, ātman is {{ultimately}} indistinguishable from Brahman, {{and the goal}} of <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> know or realize that one's ātman (soul) is identical to Brahman.

25|$|Neuroscience {{describes}} reward, pleasure, {{and motivation}} {{in terms of}} neurotransmitter activity, especially in the limbic system and the ventral tegmental area in particular. If one believes that the meaning of <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> maximize pleasure and to ease general life, then this allows normative predictions about how to act to achieve this. Likewise, some ethical naturalists advocate a science of morality– the empirical pursuit of flourishing for all conscious creatures.|$|E
25|$|In the Judaic world view, {{the meaning}} of <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> elevate the {{physical}} world ('Olam HaZeh') and prepare it {{for the world to}} come ('Olam HaBa'), the messianic era. This is called Tikkun Olam ("Fixing the World"). Olam HaBa can also mean the spiritual afterlife, and there is debate concerning the eschatological order. However, Judaism is not focused on personal salvation, but on communal (between man and man) and individual (between man and God) spiritualised actions in this world.|$|E
25|$|A major {{challenge}} for waste gasification technologies {{is to reach}} an acceptable (positive) gross electric efficiency. The high efficiency of converting syngas to electric power is counteracted by significant power consumption in the waste preprocessing, the consumption of large amounts of pure oxygen (which is often used as gasification agent), and gas cleaning. Another challenge becoming apparent when implementing the processes in real <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> obtain long service intervals in the plants, {{so that it is}} not necessary to close down the plant every few months for cleaning the reactor.|$|E

25|$|A planet's {{movement}} {{around its}} rotational axis must also meet certain criteria if <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{have the opportunity}} to evolve. A first assumption is that the planet should have moderate seasons. If {{there is little or no}} axial tilt (or obliquity) relative to the perpendicular of the ecliptic, seasons will not occur and a main stimulant to biospheric dynamism will disappear. The planet would also be colder than it would be with a significant tilt: when the greatest intensity of radiation is always within a few degrees of the equator, warm weather cannot move poleward and a planet's climate becomes dominated by colder polar weather systems.|$|E
25|$|Objectivism's central tenets {{are that}} reality exists {{independently}} of consciousness, {{that human beings}} have direct contact with reality through sense perception, that one can attain objective knowledge from perception {{through the process of}} concept formation and inductive logic, that the proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness (rational self-interest), that the only social system consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez-faire capitalism, and that the role of art in human <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> transform humans' metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form—a work of art—that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally.|$|E
25|$|Kurt Land {{directed}} El asalto in 1960 starring Alberto de Mendoza, a crime drama shot {{in black}} and white. Lautaro Murúa, a Chilean actor working in Argentine cinema directed Alias Gardelito in 1961. The film showed strong political and social undertones and is about the difficulty of living an honest life {{in the face of}} an unrelenting poverty. The title of this story is taken from the name of the great Argentine singer Carlos Gardel, the idol of the antihero Toribio portrayed by Alberto Argibay. Toribio's goal in <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> emulate the famous singer and making his own way successfully in the music business. Yet at the same time, he does not stop his illegal means of making ends meet, stealing and petty thievery. Films such as A hierro muere starring Alberto de Mendoza and Olga Zubarry and Accidente 703 in 1962 were often co-produced with Spain and often featured both Argentine and Spanish born actors.|$|E

A medical social worker, Aasawari, quickly comes in and explains the practice to Vichare. She calms him down and accompanies them during the first appointment with the doctor. Dr. Sane quickly diagnoses child {{as a victim of}} retinoblastoma — a rare retinal cancer. After consulting with other colleagues in US and UK doctor finds that only way to save child's <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> perform an operation that will leave the child blind. As per rule, doctor explains this and insists child be informed of this before surgery. He cannot be operated without this knowledge as it was against ethics. Aasawari (Amruta Subhash) who helps the doctor in convincing the grandfather and the grandson, tries to keep track of Vichare and persuades him not fall prey to other doctors promising false medicines. She tries to befriend Parshya to explain him what is going to happen. However, she finds it is too difficult to explain to him that he will turn blind.|$|E
