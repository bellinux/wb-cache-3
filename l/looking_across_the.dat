5|$|By 1854, Hindman {{realized}} that he had little room to maneuver in the crowded Mississippi political arena. <b>Looking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi River, Hindman observed that the young and turbulent state of Arkansas was wide open for a well-educated and ambitious politician. Hindman left Mississippi politics when he moved to Helena, Arkansas on March 18, 1854.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia. The neighborhood scenes were shot in a cul-de-sac of million-dollar homes, and production housed the residents in hotels for two nights to allow for filming. Although the sequence of Sam and Dean <b>looking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> street as the grandfather is killed appears to be shot from {{inside one of the}} houses, the actors were actually standing on a two-story scaffolding across the street, looking through fake windows. Shots of them inside the house in the same scene made use of one of the basements.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{after the}} fall of Nojpetén, friar Cano {{described}} the ultimate fate of Díaz de Velasco and his companions; he claimed to have received the information from interviews with the soldiers from Yucatán who had stormed the Itza capital and from Ch'ol witnesses, although there were no Ch'ol at Nojpetén. Díaz's party arrived at the lakeshore and were told by local Itza that Franciscan friars were at Nojpetén. They were wary at first and asked for proof, upon which an Itza messenger brought them a rosary as a token. <b>Looking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> lake they saw men dressed as friars calling to them to come across, these were Itza dressed in the habits of the two Franciscans who had recently been killed at the island. Díaz and his companions then boarded the Itza canoes, leaving thirty Maya porters with their mules and supplies.|$|E

25|$|Royal National Park {{contains}} {{a wide variety}} of terrain. Roughly, landscapes in the park vary from coastal cliffs broken by beaches and small inlets to an ancient high plateau broken by extensive and deep river valleys. The river valleys drain from south to north where they run into Port Hacking, the extensive but generally shallow harbor inlet which forms the northern border of the park. When <b>looking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> park from east to west (or vice versa) the rugged folds of valley after valley fade into the distance.|$|E
25|$|Hammerwood is sited on a south-facing hill, {{commanding}} extensive {{views from}} the south-west to the south-east; its own southern façade <b>looking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> valley to a stream where the iron forge which gave the estate its name once sat. A serpentine lake, artificially dammed from this steam apparently {{as part of the}} Sperlings' landscaping (not shown on a Gardner and Gream map of 1795 but visible on the OS drawing of 1808) sits {{at the bottom of the}} valley with open parkland on either side; views of distant hills continue for two or three miles beyond. Scholars Fazio and Snadon note Latrobe's 1794 reference to a 'very intimate' acquaintance with Humphry Repton (1752–1818), the English landscape designer, and suggest that many features of the Hammerwood landscape (including unobstructed views to the south which extend far further than the 1792 boundaries of the estate) align with Repton's ideas. The influence of Capability Brown has also been noted, and ring counts of oaks felled by the Great Storm of 1987 dated them to 1793 and 1796 (suggesting that landscaping and replanting did indeed take place).|$|E
25|$|Linz. The Roman fort of ‘Lentia’ was {{established}} {{early in the}} 1st century to the S of Linz Castle and probably between the Romergasse and the Baumbach strasse. The Bavarians established themselves here in the 8th century or earlier and the surviving church of St Martin (W.of Castle) was first mentioned in 799. A market was mentioned in 844 (?) and this probably refers to the ‘Alte Stadt’, a settlement with a Y ‘Dreiech’ market place, which grew up to the E of the Castle. In 1240 Linz was granted a charter {{and it may have}} been at this time that the new town with a long rectangular market place and a grid plan was laid out to the E of the Alte Stadt. Both this new town and the Alte Stadt were now enclosed in a rectangular defensive system, presumably walled, which was joined to the Castle on the W side. The Braun and Hogenberg print of 1594 gives a good idea of how the Medieval town developed. There were square towers on the four corners of the walled town, a gate-tower leading to the bridge, built in 1497 across the Danube on the N and a tall watch tower on the gate leading from the market place in the S. This view <b>looking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Danube from the N was copied with modification by Merian in 1679 and Vischer in 1672, but Merian in 1679 adds a completely new view (from the E) of Linz showing that it had been extensively re-fortified with three large roundels added on the E and S and two roundells to the W of the Castle. The Roundels were joined by a massive curtain wall and a wide inner moat or ditch. There were no additional defences on the N (Danube). This defensive work seems to be more likely to be 16th, rather than 17th century in date. The walls were demolished by the French from 1800 onwards. The Franz II Kataster (Map - post 1817) shows only one Roundell and the two gate-towers remaining and these had been demolished by the 1830s. Today only parts of the moat survive in the Theater Platz and Oberes Graben.|$|E

500|$|The video {{opens with}} the view of a city {{populated}} with skyscrapers, intermingling railway lines and aero-crafts. Steam blows out of the funnels of a factory as big machines are shown. Madonna, wearing black lingerie, appears {{on the back of}} a statue of an angry looking swan, and utters the line: [...] "Come on girls, do you believe in love?" [...] This is followed by the chorus, showing the interiors of the factory where the workers slave at the machines, as rain pour incessantly on them. Amidst the smoke filled environment, the chiseled torso of the male workers are shown, as they strip off their shirts, with water splashing all around. Madonna is then shown in a light-green gown, holding a black cat in her lap, <b>looking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> factory from her sitting room of her penthouse office. As she sings the first verse, the workers perform choreographed dance routine inside the factory. Madonna lies down on a sofa and the cat escapes from her lap, as her singing reaches the owner of the factory, through a series of speakers. He becomes nervous hearing her voice and looks down to find one of the workers staring up and looking for the source of the voice.|$|E
2500|$|Port Jeanne d'Arc (a former whaling station {{founded by}} a Norwegian whaling company in 1908, and a former {{geomagnetic}} station at [...] ), in the northwestern corner of Presqu'île Jeanne d'Arc, <b>looking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Buenos Aires passage to ÎleLongue ( [...] northeast). The derelict settlement consists of four residential buildings with wooden walls and tin roofs, and a barn. One of the buildings was restored in 1977, and another in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|In 1936, {{while still}} a schoolboy, the artist Colin McCahon {{took part in}} a family outing, driving from the seaboard over the coastal hills. <b>Looking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Taieri Plain towards Central Otago he had what he {{described}} as a [...] "vision", seeing a pre-Biblical [...] "landscape of splendour order and peace" [...] – which, he said, it became his life's work to communicate. The same view, though seen from a greater distance, had inspired Charles Kettle in the 1840s.|$|E

2500|$|The {{people have}} a {{tradition}} {{in connection with this}} region which they implicitly believe. They say [...] "that Christ visited this part of Asia and ascended this summit, whence he looked down on all the region around. After blessing the country to the northward, he turned towards the south, and <b>looking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Baikal, he waved his hand, exclaiming 'Beyond this there is nothing.'" [...] Thus they account for the sterility of Daouria, where it is said [...] "no corn will grow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schärding [...] First {{recorded}} in 804 AD as a possession of Passau Cathedral. In the 13th centuery the Wittelsbach family built a castle {{adjacent to the}} river Inn and the town developed around the castle. A charter was granted in 1316. The walls with demi-lune bastions survive on the E side and had an earthern rampart to the rear and a wide ditch in front. Parts of the walls were pulled down by French troops in 1809. On the W, the Wassertor of 1427, survives, to the N the Passau Tor and on the E is the double bastioned Linzer Tor. In the 17th century the fortifications were extended to the S to include the Kurhaus Kirke. Merian’s view of 1644 -in ‘Topographia Bavariae’- is <b>looking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> river Inn showing the western defences {{and the extent to}} which the town was dominated by the Witelsbach castle ...|$|E
2500|$|Ebenfurth. [...] On {{the former}} {{boundary}} of Austria with Hungary. Granted a charter in 1515. [...] Today, {{apart from the}} Castle, {{there appears to be}} no trace of defensive walls. The Merian (1649/1679) and Vischer (1672) prints show the town was well fortified. Both artists show the town from the SE <b>looking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> river Leitha, but Merian shows the walls in a ruinous state and a gate tower with a bastion in front, while the Vischer shows the gate tower blocked, without the bastion and a large round tower has appeared to the S of the gate-tower. It is possible that these changes were made to counter the Turkish threat. [...] The gate tower may be the same as the Stattor that was still standing in the 1850s. [...] Vertical GIS images and present day property boundaries show that the Ebenfurth defences were roughly five sided, joining onto the castle at the south.|$|E
