It featured a gigantic version of West's teddy bear mascot Dropout Bear roaming {{through the streets}} of London. The advert received an award from British music magazine Music Week for Best Music TV Commercial. On the day of the album's release, West made an in-store appearance at New York's Lincoln Center Tower Records to autograph copies for fans.

40|$|Abstract. Though in most data {{warehousing}} applications no relevance {{is given to}} the time when events are recorded, some domains call for a different behavior. In particular, whenever <b>late</b> <b>registrations</b> of events take place, and particularly when the events registered are subject to further updates, the traditional design solutions fail in preserving accountability and query consistency. In this paper we discuss the alternative design solutions that can be adopted, in presence of <b>late</b> <b>registrations,</b> to support different types of queries that enable meaningful historical analysis. These solutions are based on the enforcement of the distinction between transaction time and valid time within the model that represents the fact of interest. In particular, we show how <b>late</b> <b>registrations</b> can be differently supported depending on the flow or stock semantics given to events. ...|$|R

5|$|Beginning {{his second}} effort that fall, West would invest two million dollars {{and take over}} a year to craft his second album. West was {{significantly}} inspired by Roseland NYC Live, a 1998 live album by English trip hop group Portishead, produced with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip-hop production. Though West {{had not been able}} to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album <b>Late</b> <b>Registration.</b> West collaborated with American film score composer Jon Brion, who served as the album's co-executive producer for several tracks. Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre. <b>Late</b> <b>Registration</b> sold over 2.3million units in the United States alone by the end of 2005 and was considered by industry observers as the only successful major album release of the fall season, which had been plagued by steadily declining CD sales.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by indie {{rock bands}} and house music, Graduation marked a {{departure}} {{away from the}} ornate, soul-based sound of West's previous releases toward a more anthemic style of rap music that would function well while he was performing in large arenas. Toward this end, West incorporated synthesizer sounds into his production and dabbled with electronic music, while sampling from a wider spectrum of music genres. Lyrically, the album is more introspective in comparison to its predecessors, as West dedicated much of Graduation towards analyzing himself and conveying his ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame. It continues the education theme of West's previous two studio albums, The College Dropout (2004) and <b>Late</b> <b>Registration</b> (2005).|$|E
5|$|<b>Late</b> <b>Registration</b> is {{the second}} of Kanye West's planned four education-themed studio albums. Following the major success of The College Dropout, the album reveals his {{progression}} in writing lyrics and an incorporation of {{a wider range of}} musical styles. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, {{due in part to the}} acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West felt he had become too dependent on the technique, he decided to find a new sound.|$|E

5|$|<b>Late</b> <b>Registration</b> is {{the second}} studio album by American hip hop {{producer}} and rapper Kanye West. It was recorded {{over the course of}} a year in sessions held across studios in New York City and Hollywood, with West collaborating with American record producer and composer Jon Brion. The album features guest contributions from Adam Levine, Lupe Fiasco, Jamie Foxx, Common, Jay-Z, Brandy, and Nas, among others. Its production was notably more lush and elaborate than West's 2004 debut album The College Dropout, as he utilized intricate sampling methods and string orchestration with Brion. West's lyrics explore both personal and political themes, including poverty, drug trafficking, racism, healthcare, and the blood diamond trade.|$|E
5|$|West {{took over}} a year and {{invested}} two million dollars towards the construction of <b>Late</b> <b>Registration.</b> The majority of the recording sessions for the album took place at Sony Music Studios in New York City and at The Record Plant in Hollywood, California; other sessions took place at Chalice Recording Studios and Grandmaster Recording Studios in Hollywood. He began working in the studio after he finished touring with Usher on the R singer's The Truth Tour. By November 2004, West had completed nearly seventy-five percent of the album. However he felt unsatisfied with its outcome and in March of the following year, he brought in Jon Brion, which drastically altered the project's direction.|$|E
5|$|On <b>Late</b> <b>Registration,</b> West drew {{inspiration}} from English trip hop band Portishead and collaborated with film score composer Jon Brion. The album's music blends West's primary soulful hip hop production with Brion's elaborate chamber pop orchestration, and experimentally delves into {{a wide array of}} different genres, including jazz, blues, rock, R, spoken word, funk, turntablism, western classical, and psychedelic soul. With the presence of Brion, who conducts a twenty-piece orchestra and plays instruments individually selected by West, the album is largely orchestral in nature, brandishing a euphony of string arrangements, piano chords, brass flecks, and horn riffs among other symphonic instrumentation. They also incorporated a myriad of foreign and vintage instruments not typical in popular music, let alone hip hop, such as a celesta, harpsichord, Chamberlin, CS-80 analog synthesizer, Chinese bells and berimbau, vibraphones, and marimba.|$|E

In order to prove so, exhibitors are likely to be asked for their <b>latest</b> <b>registration</b> certificate or other documents that can provide proof of a bona fide business. There is also a fee that must be paid by every exhibitor and which depends on the type of booth the exhibitor wants to use. The smallest fee is of $4,680 for a standard booth of 9 m2. Exhibitors who need wide spaces to display their products may get a raw space of at least 27 m2, for $455/m2.|$|R

5|$|Kanye West {{began working}} on Graduation {{immediately}} after releasing his second studio album <b>Late</b> <b>Registration.</b> By late September 2005, West had already completed three songs for the album, which he intended to contain a total of twelve tracks. Around {{the time of the}} recording of the third studio album, West would often listen to songs written by folk and country singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his word play and storytelling abilities. The former musician had been recommended to West by multiple of his friends, including English disc jockey Samantha Ronson, all of whom claimed his music and the way he dealt with the press reminded them of Dylan. Kanye also listened to his most favorite alternative rock bands, including The Killers, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, and Keane, in order to gain new ideas on how to make his hip-hop production style more stadium-friendly. Additionally, West would often test his new songs on his iPod, in his office, in dance clubs and just about anywhere people might listen to his music. He would then make adjustments to the tracks based on feedback he received, repeating the process as many times as necessary.|$|E

[...] Kim concurred with this sentiment, stating, [...] "West ambitiously attempts to depart from the street sensibilities of Dropout by giving <b>Late</b> <b>Registration</b> a shiny, quasi-alt-pop finish." ...|$|E

40|$|The new {{perinatal}} death certificate {{proposed by the}} World Health Organisation was examined in relation to existing measures for recording {{perinatal death}} statistics and also with regard to new information gathered. Present procedures appear to underestimate the number of perinatal deaths by roughly 10 %, though <b>late</b> <b>registrations</b> may lower this figure slightly. The use of a minimum birth weight as the criterion for inclusion in perinatal statistics removed much of the uncertainty associated with definitions of live birth and stillbirth. The new certificate led to duplication of some information already recorded through birth notification yet failed to provide information on some other factors generally considered relevant to perinatal mortality. The format proposed for recording cause of death provided a more logical presentation of events. Standardizing birth information recorded on all infants, modifying death certificates, and developing efficient record-linkage schemes would be more valuable than introducing the WHO certificate. Useful interpretation {{of the meaning of}} the characteristics of infants dying in the perinatal period awaits these timely changes...|$|R
