25|$|The British South Africa Company's {{administration}} of what became Rhodesia was chartered in 1889 by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, and {{began with the}} Pioneer Column's march north-east to Mashonaland in 1890. Empowered by its charter to acquire, govern and develop the area north of the Transvaal in southern Africa, the Company, headed by Cecil Rhodes, raised its own armed forces and carved out a huge bloc of territory through treaties, concessions and occasional military action, most prominently overcoming the Matabele army in the First and Second Matabele Wars of the 1890s. By {{the turn of the}} century, Rhodes's Company held a vast, <b>land-locked</b> <b>country,</b> bisected by the Zambezi river. It officially named this land Rhodesia in 1895, and ran it until the early 1920s.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of Tiwanaku empire, the many Aymara Lake Titicaca were conquered by the Inca empire. Prior to the Spanish conquest, the Andean {{province}} of Qullasuyu {{was a part of}} the Inca empire, while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent nomadic tribes. Spanish conquistadors, arriving from Cuzco and Asunción took control of the region in the 16th century. During most of the Spanish colonial rule, Bolivia was known as Upper Peru and administered by the Royal Audiencia of Charcas. After the first call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Bolivian Republic, named for the Liberator Simón Bolívar, on August 6, 1825. Since then Bolivia has endured regular periods of political and economic instability, including the loss of various provinces to its neighbors, such as Acre, parts of the Gran Chaco and its Pacific coast, making it a <b>land-locked</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E

30|$|There is also {{scope for}} {{integrating}} <b>land-locked</b> <b>countries</b> in our reference sample of coastal <b>countries.</b> <b>Land-locked</b> <b>countries</b> also trade overseas, albeit {{making use of}} seaports of neighboring transit countries. By assigning the maritime connectivity of transit countries to the trade of <b>land-locked</b> <b>countries,</b> {{we should be able}} to generate a refined figure of the impact of maritime connectivity that could be made group specific. We could also take into account trade logistics indicators such as the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI) of both, the land-locked and the transit countries.|$|R

From Goba a Mozambique Ports and Railways line connects to the ports of Matola and Maputo. Swazi Rail also has two {{connections}} to South Africa: a northern link from Mpaka to Komatipoort in Mpumalanga on the Pretoria-Maputo railway, and a southern link from Phuzumoya to Golela in KwaZulu-Natal, from where the Transnet network connects to the ports of Richards Bay and Durban.|$|E
50|$|The fishing {{industry}} in the <b>land-locked</b> <b>country</b> of Laos is {{a major source of}} sustenance and food security to its people dwelling near rivers, reservoirs and ponds. Apart from wild capture fisheries, which is a major component of fish production, aquaculture and stocking are significant developments in the country. Historically, fishing activity was recorded in writings on the gate and walls of the Wat Xieng Thong in Luang Prabang dated 1560. For many Laotians, freshwater fish are the principal source of protein. The percentage of people involved in regular fishing activity is very small, only near major rivers or reservoirs, as for most of the fishers it is a part-time activity.|$|E

50|$|The road is an {{all-weather}} tarmac, {{single carriageway road}} in good condition. This road {{is part of the}} Northern Corridor, a {{road system}} that connects the East African cities of Bujumbura, in Burundi, Kigali, in Rwanda and Kampala, in Uganda to Nairobi, in Kenya and ultimately to the Kenyan port of Mombasa. The road is a vital commercial link to the outside world for the three <b>land-locked</b> <b>countries.</b> It is also a vital road link to the sea, for many parts of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|R
50|$|This road, {{together}} with its sister road, Nairobi-Malaba Road, {{is part of}} the Great North Road, that links the Kenyan coast to the <b>land-locked</b> <b>countries</b> of Burundi, Eastern DR Congo, Rwanda, Uganda and South Sudan. The road moves more than 50 percent of all goods traded in the East African Community. Due to the volume of traffic, and the concentration of heavy-duty transport vehicles, the route is accident-prone, accounting for a large number of injuries and fatalities in the region. In 2013 alone, 3,179 people lost their lives in traffic accidents on the combined Mombasa-Malaba Road.|$|R
50|$|On 25 November 2001, the Marines and Sailors of the 15th MEU (SOC) {{conducted}} an Amphibious assault over 400 mi into the <b>land-locked</b> <b>country</b> of Afghanistan.

25|$|Cyprinids {{are highly}} {{important}} food fish; they are fished and farmed across Eurasia. In <b>land-locked</b> <b>countries</b> in particular, cyprinids {{are often the}} major species of fish eaten because they make the largest part of biomass in most water types except for fast-flowing rivers. In Eastern Europe, they are often prepared with traditional methods, such as drying and salting. The prevalence of inexpensive frozen fish products made this less important {{now than it was}} in earlier times. Nonetheless, in certain places, they remain popular for food, as well as recreational fishing, and have been deliberately stocked in ponds and lakes for centuries for this reason.|$|R

The new Laotian Navy was originally trained and staffed by French Officers and senior Petty Officers seconded from the naval forces component of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps (CEFEO), although a small number of selected Laotian naval officer candidate students (French: Eléves Officiers de Marine - EOMs) were also sent to France, in order to attend advanced Officer and Petty Officer courses at the French Naval Academy in Brest.|$|E
50|$|Laos is a <b>land-locked</b> <b>country</b> {{located in}} southeastern Asia. The {{northern}} part is mountainous, with the Luang Prabang Range separating the northwestern {{part of the}} country from Thailand. The Xiangkhoang Plateau separates these mountains from the Annamite Range, a chain of mountains which run parallel with the Vietnamese coast, and mark the easternmost boundary of the country. The west of the country is mostly bounded by the broad Mekong River, and the south is the Bolaven Plateau at some 1000 to 1350 m above sea level. Laos lies in the monsoon belt and experiences a rainy seasons between May and November when much rain falls, and a dry season without rain from December to April. This results in a natural forest cover of deciduous, broadleaf trees, that lose their leaves during the dry season.There is a distinct rainy season from May to November, followed by a dry season from December to the middle of April.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the next}} few decades, Bolivia began to push the natives out and settle in the Gran Chaco, while Paraguay ignored it. Bolivia sought the Paraguay River for {{shipping}} oil out into the sea (it had become a <b>land-locked</b> <b>country</b> after the loss of its Pacific coast in the War of the Pacific), and Paraguay claimed ownership of the land. This became the backdrop to The Gran Chaco War (1932-1935) between Paraguay and Bolivia over supposed oil in the Chaco Boreal (the aforementioned region north of the Pilcomayo River and {{to the west of}} the Paraguay River). Eventually, Argentine Foreign Minister Carlos Saavedra Lamas mediated a cease fire and subsequent treaty signed in 1938, which gave Paraguay three quarters of the Chaco Boreal and gave Bolivia a corridor to the Paraguay River with the ability to use the Puerto Casado and the right to construct their own port. In the end, no oil was found in the region.|$|E

40|$|<b>Land-locked</b> <b>countries</b> of Eastern and Central Africa namely: Burundi, Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda are {{connected}} to two main Indian Ocean ports of Mombasa in Kenya and Dares Salaam in Tanzania. There are two distinct transport corridors that connect the two ports to the land locked countries in the sub-region. The Northern corridor connects Mombasa to Rwanda, Burundi, and eastern DRC via Uganda, whereas the Central corridor connects the same countries via Tanzania. Both corridors fall within the geographical coverage of Eastern Africa Sub-regional Development Center (EASRDC). The Mombasa meeting was mainly concerned with transit traffic passing through the Northern Corridor. This corridor has a formal transit transport agreement known as Northern Corridor Transit Transport Agreement, which was signed, by the five member States in 1985...|$|R
