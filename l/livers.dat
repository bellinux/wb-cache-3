5|$|In some countries, geese {{and ducks}} are force-fed to produce <b>livers</b> with an {{exceptionally}} high fat {{content for the}} production of foie gras. Over 75% of world production of this product occurs in France, with lesser industries in Hungary and Bulgaria and a growing production in China. Foie gras is considered a luxury {{in many parts of the}} world, but the process of feeding the birds in this way is banned in many countries on animal welfare grounds.|$|E
5|$|Domesticated rats have {{a longer}} {{lifespan}} than that of wild rats. Because domesticated rats are protected from predators and have ready access to food, water, shelter, and medical care, their average lifespan is around two to three years, in contrast to wild R. norvegicus which average a lifespan of less than one year. However, wild rats generally have larger brains, hearts, <b>livers,</b> kidneys, and adrenal glands than laboratory rats. The fancy rat and wild rat also both face a multitude of differing health concerns; the former is at risk of developing a pneumococcal infection from exposure to humans, while the latter may harbor tapeworms after coming in contact with carriers like cockroaches and fleas.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to obvious dangers such as rodenticides, insecticides, and herbicides, cats may be poisoned by many chemicals usually considered safe by their human guardians, because their <b>livers</b> are less effective at {{some forms of}} detoxification than those of many other animals, including humans and dogs. Some {{of the most common}} causes of poisoning in cats are antifreeze and rodent baits. Cats may be particularly sensitive to environmental pollutants.

5|$|Living almost {{exclusively}} in the aphotic zone where little to no sunlight penetrates, the Portuguese dogfish is relatively common and the dominant shark species in deeper waters. The large, squalene-rich liver of this shark allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy and hover with minimal effort; males contain more squalene in their <b>livers</b> than females. A tracking study in the Porcupine Seabight {{has found that the}} Portuguese dogfish has an average swimming speed of , and does not remain in any particular area for long.

Known parasites of this species include monogeneans in the genus Erpocotyle, and the tapeworms Sphyriocephalus viridis, S. richardi, and Anthobothrium sp.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of variations in fatty <b>liver</b> on the ultrasonographic detection of focal <b>liver</b> lesions. Methods: A total of 229 patients with varying degrees of fatty <b>liver</b> and focal <b>liver</b> lesions and 200 patients with focal <b>liver</b> lesions but no fatty <b>liver</b> were randomly selected for inclusion in groups I and II, respectively. Findings of focal <b>liver</b> lesions identified on computed tomography were taken as the reference, and findings on ultrasonography were compared with them. Results: The number of focal <b>liver</b> lesions in groups I and II were 501 and 413, respectively. The ultrasonographic detection rates of focal <b>liver</b> lesions in groups I and II were 86. 8 % (435 / 501) and 94. 2 % (389 / 413), respectively. Comparison of the detection of the focal lesions between patients with and without fatty <b>liver</b> or different grades of fatty <b>liver</b> were as follows: mild fatty <b>liver</b> (162 / 177) vs. <b>liver</b> without fat infiltration (389 / 413) (P= 0. 277); mild fatty <b>liver</b> (162 / 177) vs. moderate fatty <b>liver</b> (190 / 212) (P= 0. 604); mild fatty <b>liver</b> (162 / 177) vs. severe fatty <b>liver</b> (83 / 112) (P< 0. 001); moderate fatty <b>liver</b> (190 / 212) vs. <b>liver</b> without fat infiltration (389 / 413) (P= 0. 051); moderate fatty <b>liver</b> (190 / 212) vs. severe fatty <b>liver</b> (83 / 112) (P< 0. 001); severe fatty <b>liver</b> (83 / 112) vs. <b>liver</b> without fat infiltration (389 / 413) (P< 0. 001); and fatty <b>liver</b> (435 / 501) vs. <b>liver</b> without fat infiltration (389 / 413) (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Mild and moderate fatty <b>liver</b> are not significantly associated with the visualization of the lesion, while severe fatty <b>liver</b> usually impairs the detection of focal lesions in the <b>liver.</b> If a patient with severe fatty <b>liver</b> is suspected to have a <b>liver</b> tumor, ultrasonography should only be chosen cautiously in case of a missed diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|The main {{features}} of <b>liver</b> failure are extensive necrosis of hepatocytes, rapid disease progression, and poor prognosis, and at present, {{there are no}} effective drugs and methods {{for the treatment of}} <b>liver</b> failure. This article summarizes four treatment methods for <b>liver</b> failure, i. e., medical treatment, cell transplantation, <b>liver</b> transplantation, and artificial <b>liver</b> support therapy, and elaborates on the existing treatment methods. The current medical treatment regimen should be optimized; cell transplantation has not been used in clinical practice; <b>liver</b> transplantation is the most effective method, but it is limited by donor <b>liver</b> shortage and high costs; artificial <b>liver</b> can effectively remove toxic substances in human body. Therefore, this article puts forward artificial <b>liver</b> as a transition for <b>liver</b> transplantation; artificial <b>liver</b> can buy time for <b>liver</b> regeneration or <b>liver</b> transplantation and prolong patientsâ€² survival time and thus has a promising future.

5|$|The case baffles Colton, as {{the only}} common {{elements}} in the murders are the lack of entry points and the apparent removal of the victims' <b>livers</b> with bare hands. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks over the case and notes their similarity to earlier murder sprees that occurred in 1933 and 1963. At the crime scene, Mulder notices an elongated fingerprint on the air vent, which he also finds {{to be similar to}} some documented in the X-Files. He concludes that because five murders occurred during the earlier sprees, the investigators should expect two more.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese dogfish is {{too small}} and occurs too deep to pose a danger to humans. This species has long been commercially fished, using hook-and-line, gillnets, and trawls. It is mainly valued for its liver, which {{contains}} 2249% squalene by weight and is processed for vitamins. The meat may also be sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, or converted into fishmeal. An important fishery for the Portuguese dogfish exists in Suruga Bay for liver oil; catches peaked during World War II, but declined soon after from over-exploitation. In the past few years, catches by the South East Trawl Fishery off Australia have been increasing, as fishers have been seeking out species not covered by commercial quotas following the relaxation of seafood mercury regulations. Shark landings in this fishery are affected by a prohibition on landing <b>livers</b> without {{the rest of the}} carcass.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Mawson and Mertz's {{illnesses}} remains {{in part a}} mystery. At the time, McLeanâ€”the expedition's chief surgeon {{and one of the}} men who had remained at Cape Denisonâ€”attributed their sickness to colitis; Mawson wrote in The Home of the Blizzard, his official account of the expedition, that Mertz died of fever and appendicitis. A 1969 study by Sir John Cleland and R. V. Southcott of the University of Adelaide concluded that the symptoms Mawson describedâ€”hair, skin and weight loss, depression, dysentery and persistent skin infectionsâ€”indicated the men had suffered hypervitaminosis A, an excessive intake of vitamin A. This is found in unusually high quantities in the <b>livers</b> of Greenland Huskies, of which both Mertz and Mawson consumed large amounts.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Liver</b> surgery {{requires}} {{mobilization of}} the <b>liver</b> resulting in injury. Mobilization is the predominant cause of hepatocyte damage during <b>liver</b> surgery and jeopardizes post-operative <b>liver</b> function. Previously, mobilization-induced <b>liver</b> injury {{was found to}} be associated with in-flammation. So far, anti-inflammatory drugs to potentially prevent <b>liver</b> inflammation following <b>liver</b> mobilization were not tested. In this study, we aimed to establish an in vivo mouse model of mobilization-induced <b>liver</b> injury and to evaluate the effect of anti-inflammatory pre-treatment before <b>liver</b> mobilization on <b>liver</b> inflammation.

5|$|Mortality under captivity is {{generally}} high; reasons include stillbirths, birth defects, cannibalism, hypothermia, neglect of cubs by mothers, and infectious diseases. A study comparing {{the health of}} captive and wild cheetahs noted that despite having similar genetic make-up, wild cheetahs are far healthier than their captive counterparts. The study identified possible stress factors such as restricted habitat and interaction with human beings and other carnivores, and recommended private and spacious areas for captive cheetahs. A study of diseases suffered by captive cheetahs in the period 1989â€“92 in several North American zoos showed that hepatic veno-occlusive disease, a disease of the liver, had affected 82% of the deceased cheetahs, caused nine deaths, and occurred in 51% of living females. Chronic gastritis was detected in 91% of the population. Glomerulosclerosis, a disease of the kidneys, emerged as another significant disease, affecting 84% of the cheetahs; another renal disease, nephrosclerosis, affected 39% of the cheetahs. Feline infectious peritonitis caused two deaths. Pneumonia was a major cause for juvenile deaths. Another study concluded that excess of vitaminA in their diets could result in veno-occlusive disease in their <b>livers.</b>|$|E
