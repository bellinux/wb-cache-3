[...] The cutters are also equipped with the AN/SLQ-32 Electronic Warfare (EW) system used in the DDG-51. [...] The Legend class is equipped with the same 220 rpm Bofors 57 mm gun as mounted on the USN's Littoral combat ships. [...] The Missile Defense duties are handled by the NULKA decoy systems, the MK 36 SRBOC decoy systems also used on the FFG-7 and CG-47 programs and the CIWS. The combination of the Mk 110 and the Phalanx give the cutter's Anti-Surface capability, limited Air-Defense capability and the capability to provide naval gunfire support. The cutters increased interoperability means they are capable of executing assigned naval warfare tasks with the US Navy. The sonar is reported as having mine and underwater swimmer location ability. The cutters have space, weight, and power reserved for additional weapons and systems which includes mine warfare systems, non-line of sight missiles, and can have a SeaRAM replace the 20mm Phalanx CIWS. [...] The NSC has a NBC detection and defense system to repel chemical, biological, or radiological attacks and has wash-down systems. The cutters weapons, command and control suite can be upgraded and is hardened to survive potential attacks and process increased data flow.|$|E

In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm to con-struct a QoSRT that adapts quickly to changes in <b>links</b> <b>bandwidths.</b> The QoSRT is uniquely constructed for maintenance purposes, so a change to a <b>link</b> s <b>bandwidth</b> is handled within the local subtree.

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} {{distributed}} scheduling algorithm for provisioning of guaranteed <b>link</b> <b>bandwidths</b> in ad hoc mesh networks. The guaranteed <b>link</b> <b>bandwidths</b> {{are necessary to}} provide deterministic end-to-end bandwidth guarantees. Using Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), links are assigned slots in each frame and during each slot a number of non-conflicting links can transmit simultaneously. The <b>bandwidth</b> of each <b>link</b> is given {{by the number of}} slots assigned to it the frame and the modulation used in the slots. Our scheduling algorithm has two parts. The first part of the algorithm is an iterative procedure that finds locally feasible schedules by exchanging link scheduling information between nodes. The iterative procedure is based on the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm running on the conflict graph, whose partial view is available at every node. The second part of the algorithm is a wave based termination procedure used to detect when all nodes are locally scheduled and a new schedule should be activated. We use analysis to show the worst case convergence time of the algorithm and simulations to show performance of the algorithm in practice...|$|R

40|$|Domical is a {{recently}} introduced cooperative caching technique for streaming media (audio and video clips) in wireless home networks. It employs asymmetry {{of the available}} <b>link</b> <b>bandwidths</b> to control placement of data across the caches of different devices. A key research question is what are the merits of this design decision. To answer this question, we compare Domical with DCOORD, a cooperative caching technique that ignores asymmetry of network <b>link</b> <b>bandwidths</b> in its caching decisions. We perform a qualitative and quantitative analysis of these two techniques. The quantitative analysis focuses on startup latency defined as the delay incurred from when a device references a clip to the onset of its display. Obtained results show Domical enhances this metric significantly when compared with DCOORD inside a wireless home network. The qualitative analysis shows DCOORD is a scalable technique that is appropriate for networks consisting of many devices. While Domical is not appropriate for such networks, we do not anticipate a home network to exceed {{more than a handful}} of wireless devices. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{explosive}} {{expansion of}} data center sizes ag-gravates the power consumption and carbon footprint, which has restricted the sustainable growth of cloud services and seriously troubled data center operators. In recent years, plenty of advanced data center network architectures have been proposed. They usually employ richly-connected topologies and multi-path routing to provide high network capacity. Unfortunately, they also undergo inefficient network energy usage during the traffic valley time. To address the problem, many energy-aware flow scheduling algorithms are proposed recently, primarily considering how to aggregate traffic by flexibly choosing the routing paths, with flows fairly sharing the <b>link</b> <b>bandwidths.</b> In this paper, we leverage software defined network (SDN) technique and explore a new solution to energy-aware flow scheduling, i. e., scheduling flows {{in the time}} dimension and using exclusive routing (EXR) for each flow, i. e., a flow always exclusively utilizes the links of its routing path. The key insight is that exclusive occupation of link resources usually results in higher link utilization in high-radix data center networks, since each flow {{does not need to}} compete for the <b>link</b> <b>bandwidths</b> with others. When scheduling the flows, EXR leaves flexibility to operators to define the priorities of flows, e. g., based on flow size, flow deadline, etc. Extensive simulations and testbed experiments both show that EXR can effectively save network energy compared with the regular fair-sharing routing (FSR), and significantly reduce the average flow completion time if assigning higher scheduling priorities to smaller flows.

In most previous studies, bandwidth has been referred to arterial bandwidth.
