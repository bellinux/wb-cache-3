50|$|Humans are {{the main}} factor in {{diminishing}} populations of eastern <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidnas.</b> Locals in areas surrounding regions that these organisms inhabit often prey upon them for food. Feral dogs are known to occasionally consume this species. These mammals dig burrows, providing some protection from predation.|$|E
50|$|All <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidnas</b> were {{classified}} as a single species, until 1998 when Tim Flannery published an article identifying several new species and subspecies. Three species were then recognized based on various attributes such as body size, skull morphology, {{and the number of}} toes on the front and back feet.|$|E
5000|$|The electroreceptive {{capabilities}} of the two species of echidna (which are terrestrial) are much more simple. <b>Long-beaked</b> <b>echidnas</b> (genus Zaglossus) possess only 2,000 receptors and short-beaked echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus) merely 400 that are concentrated in {{the tip of the}} snout. This difference can be attributed to their habitat and feeding methods. Western <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidnas</b> live in wet tropical forests where they feed on earthworms in damp leaf litter, so their habitat is probably favourable to the reception of electrical signals. Contrary to this is the varied but generally more arid habitat of their short-beaked relative which feeds primarily on termites and ants in nests; the humidity in these nests presumably allows electroreception to be used in hunting for buried prey, particularly after rains. [...] Experiments have shown that echidnas can be trained to respond to weak electric fields in water and moist soil. The electric sense of the echidna is hypothesised to be an evolutionary remnant from a platypus-like ancestor.|$|E
2500|$|New Guinea's {{monotremes}} {{are restricted}} to the family Tachyglossidae, also known as echidnas. There are four species of echidnas in two genera: the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), the eastern <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidna</b> (Zaglossus bartoni), the western <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidna</b> (Zaglossus bruijni) and Sir David's <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidna</b> (Zaglossus attenboroughi).

50|$|Eastern <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidnas</b> {{are mainly}} insect eaters, or insectivores. The long snout proves {{essential}} for the Echidna’s survival because {{of its ability to}} get in between hard-to-reach places and scavenge for smaller insect organisms such as larvae and ticks. Along with this snout, they have a specific evolutionary adaptation in their tongues for snatching up various earthworms, which are its main type of food source.|$|E
50|$|The <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidnas</b> (genus Zaglossus) make {{up one of}} the two extant genera of echidnas, spiny {{monotremes}} {{that live}} in New Guinea. There are three living species and two extinct species in this genus. The extinct species were present in Australia. Echidnas are one of the two types of mammals that lay eggs, the other being the platypus. The echidnas retain reptilian features such as egg-laying but display mammalian features such as fur and lactation.|$|E
50|$|The short-beaked echidna's diet {{consists}} {{largely of}} ants and termites, while the Zaglossus (long-beaked) species typically eat worms and insect larvae.The tongues of <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidnas</b> have sharp, tiny spines {{that help them}} capture their prey.

50|$|The short-beaked echidna is {{the only}} member of its genus, sharing the family Tachyglossidae with the extant species of the genus Zaglossus that occur in New Guinea. Zaglossus species, which include the western long-beaked, Sir David's long-beaked and eastern <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidnas,</b> are all {{significantly}} larger than T. aculeatus, and their diets consist mostly of worms and grubs rather than ants and termites. Species of the Tachyglossidae are egg-laying mammals; together with the related family Ornithorhynchidae, they are the only extant monotremes in the world.|$|E
5000|$|Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) species {{represent}} a disproportionate amount of unique evolutionary history. They have few close relatives, {{are often the}} only surviving member of their genus, and sometimes the last surviving genus of their evolutionary family. Some EDGE species, such as elephants and pandas, are well known and already receive considerable conservation attention, but many others, such as the Vaquita (the world’s rarest cetacean) the bumblebee bat (arguably the world’s smallest mammal) and the egg-laying <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidnas</b> are highly threatened yet remain poorly understood and are frequently overlooked by existing conservation frameworks. Recent research indicates that 70% of the world’s most threatened and evolutionarily distinct mammal species are currently receiving little or no conservation attention. [...] If these species are not highlighted and conserved we will not only lose many of the world’s unique species and a disproportionate amount of biodiversity, but we may also greatly reduce the potential for future evolution. The Zoological Society of London (ZSL) has launched a new global conservation initiative, the EDGE of Existence Programme to raise awareness and funds {{for the conservation of}} these species.|$|E
50|$|The long-beaked echidna {{is larger}} than the short-beaked and has fewer, shorter spines {{scattered}} among its coarse hairs. The snout is two-thirds of the head length and curves slightly downward. There are five digits on both hind and forefeet, but on the former, only the three middle toes are equipped with claws. Males have a spur on each of the hind legs. This echidna is primarily a nocturnal animal that forages for its insect food on the forest floor. The animals are not usually foraging in the daylight. The long-beaked echidna lives in dens and they are commonly found to be in underground burrows. The breeding female has a temporary abdominal brood patch, in which her egg is incubated and in which the newborn young remains in safety, feeding and developing. Since they reproduce by laying eggs and are incubated outside of the mother’s body it is accompanied by the prototherian lactation process show that they are early mammals. The long-beaked echidna has a short weaning period. During this time milk is their only source of nutrition and protection for the hatchlings; they are altricial and immunologically naive. Little is known about the life of this rarely seen animal, but it is believed to have habits {{similar to those of the}} short-beaked echidna; unlike them, however, the <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidnas</b> feed primarily on earthworms rather than ants. The population of echidnas in New Guinea is declining because of forest clearing and overhunting, and the animal is much in need of protection.|$|E

50|$|The largest known monotreme (egg-laying mammal) {{ever was}} the extinct <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidna</b> species known as Zaglossus hacketti, known {{from a couple}} of bones found in Western Australia. It {{was the size of a}} sheep, {{weighing}} probably up to 30 kg.|$|R
50|$|Zaglossus robustus is an {{extinct species}} of <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidna</b> {{known from the}} middle Miocene (about 13 or 14 million years ago) of Gulgong, New South Wales, Australia.

50|$|There {{are four}} birds {{species that are}} named after him: Waigeo brushturkey (Aepypodius bruijnii), red-breasted pygmy parrot (Micropsitta bruijnii), torrent-lark (Grallina bruijni) and pale-billed sicklebill (Drepanornis bruijnii). Further Mantou's riflebird and two mammal species: western <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidna</b> (Zaglossus bruijnii) and lowland brush mouse (Pogonomelomys bruijni) and one lizard: Bruijni forest dragon (Hypsilurus bruijni).|$|R
50|$|The eastern <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidna</b> is {{a member}} of the order Monotremata. Although {{monotremes}} have some of the same mammal features such as hair and mammary glands, they do not give birth to live young, they lay eggs. Like birds and reptiles, monotremes have a single opening, the cloaca. The cloaca allows for the passage of urine and feces, the transmission of sperm, and the laying of eggs.|$|R
50|$|The eastern <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidna</b> can be {{distinguished}} from {{other members of the}} genus by the number of claws on the fore and hind feet: it has five claws on its fore feet and four on its hind feet. Its weight varies from 5 to 10 kg; its body length ranges from 60 to 100 cm; it has no tail. It has dense black fur. It rolls into a spiny ball for defense.|$|R
50|$|Although {{they are}} {{sometimes}} {{commonly referred to as}} giant echidnas, Megalibgwilia species are thought to have been similar in size to the contemporary western <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidna,</b> but with slightly longer forearms. They were smaller than a large species known from fossils in Australia, Zaglossus hacketti. M. ramsayi fossils have been found in deposits across mainland Australia and on Tasmania. M. robusta has only been found in New South Wales. Megalibgwilia was probably an insect-eater, like the short-beaked echidna, rather than a worm-eater like members of Zaglossus.|$|R
50|$|The authors bring several {{elements}} {{into focus}} in their work; mainly {{the notions of}} Ted Kaczynski and his manifesto — focusing heavily on the way technology seems to be corrupting, rather than advancing the human race. Played as a parallel against the destructive progression of technology is the journey of the now extinct western <b>long-beaked</b> <b>echidna</b> and its attempt to find it a mate like itself to prevent disappearing forever. The strong thematic ties between the two; man thinking he can disappear despite always being watched by satellites, and the creature thinking it will never disappear, despite being the last of its kind, are deeply thought provoking.|$|R
