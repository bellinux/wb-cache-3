5|$|Roman {{literature}} {{focuses on}} the dining habits of the upper classes, for whom the evening meal (cena) had important social functions. Guests were entertained in a finely decorated dining room (triclinium), often {{with a view of}} the peristyle garden. Diners lounged on couches, leaning on the <b>left</b> <b>elbow.</b> By the late Republic, if not earlier, women dined, reclined, and drank wine along with men.|$|E
5|$|Following his NHL draft, he {{underwent}} surgery for chipped bones in his <b>left</b> <b>elbow</b> in August 1993. As a result, {{he was unable}} to participate in the Islanders' training camp in September and was returned to the OHL. Playing in his third season for Guelph, he improved to 28 goals and 82 points over 61 games. Bertuzzi competed for an Islanders' roster spot at their 1994 training camp, but was sent back to his junior team after going scoreless in three exhibition games.|$|E
5|$|Hill has {{experienced}} only one major accident in her climbing career. On May 9, 1989, she fell during a climb in Buoux, France; after forgetting {{to tie a}} safety rope, she fell 85ft (25m) into a tree, and was knocked unconscious, dislocated her <b>left</b> <b>elbow</b> and broke a bone in her foot. She had been training hard for the World Cup and had to stop competing {{for a few months}} to recover; she was devastated to miss the first World Cup in the sport. However, only six weeks after her fall, she was back climbing.|$|E

50|$|After {{his fight}} with Ellenberger, Rocha hoped {{to compete at}} UFC 134 in Rio pending the results of {{shoulder}} and elbow surgery. However, further X-rays showed severe damage in both his right and <b>left</b> <b>elbows,</b> leaving him unable {{to compete for the}} rest of 2011. He had hoped to return some time in early 2012, but was unable to schedule a fight. After recovering from surgery he moved to the US and started training with team Black House in Los Angeles, California.|$|R
5|$|Nevin in 2002 played first base, {{which was}} {{considered}} his strongest defensive position. But injuries shortened his 2002 and 2003 seasons. In 2002, he missed {{time with a}} strained <b>left</b> <b>elbow.</b> Three games after returning from the elbow injury, he broke his arm diving for a ground ball, causing him to miss another six weeks. After being heckled by a fan during a September 2002 game, Nevin gave the fan the finger, for which he apologized.|$|E
5|$|After his tournament {{victory in}} July 2007, Asashōryū decided {{to skip the}} {{regional}} summer tour of Tōhoku and Hokkaidō beginning on 3 August because of injury. The medical forms submitted to the Japan Sumo Association indicated that injuries to his <b>left</b> <b>elbow</b> and a stress fracture in his lower back would require six weeks of rest to heal. However, he was then seen on television participating in a soccer match for charity with Hidetoshi Nakata in his homeland of Mongolia. He {{was reported to have}} done so {{at the request of the}} Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Mongolian government. However, the suggestion that he had exaggerated the extent of his injuries to avoid his duties on the exhibition tour caused a media storm.|$|E
5|$|Nathan was {{promoted}} to the San Francisco Giants on April 20, 1999, taking the roster spot of superstar slugger Barry Bonds, who went {{on the disabled list}} after <b>left</b> <b>elbow</b> surgery. He made his major league debut the next day, pitching seven shutout innings and winning his first major league decision against the Florida Marlins, 4–0. He then divided {{the rest of the season}} between the AAA Fresno Grizzlies and the Giants, going 6–4 with the Griz and 7–4 and 4.18 with the Giants, earning his first career save on May 16 against the Houston Astros.|$|E

60|$|We climbed and climbed; {{and we kept}} on climbing; {{we reached}} about forty summits, {{but there was always}} another one just ahead. It came on to rain, and it rained in dead earnest. We were soaked through and it was bitter cold. Next a smoky fog of clouds covered the whole region densely, and we took to the railway-ties to keep from getting lost. Sometimes we slopped along in a narrow path on the {{left-hand}} side of the track, but by and by when the fog blew aside a little and we saw that we were treading the rampart of a precipice and that our <b>left</b> <b>elbows</b> were projecting over a perfectly boundless and bottomless vacancy, we gasped, and jumped for the ties again.|$|R
5|$|The only goal of {{the game}} {{followed}} shortly thereafter. Curtis went on a run for Cardiff, who passed it forward near the box to Ferguson. He shot the ball towards the goal, but it had little power and was easily picked up by Lewis. However, as he did so, the ball squirmed out of Lewis' hands and slipped in between {{the crook of his}} <b>left</b> <b>elbow</b> and body. With a couple of Cardiff City forwards closing in, Lewis tried to reclaim the ball but only succeeded in knocking it into the net with his elbow. Arsenal sought to attack immediately after the kick off, but despite it looking promising, Brain was caught offside. Cardiff countered, and possibly could have had a second goal, but Curtis chose to shoot himself rather than pass to Davies, who would have been presented with an open goal had he received the ball as Lewis was out of position. The match ended with a victory for Cardiff City by one goal to nil. The King presented the trophy to Cardiff's captain Keenor, and medals to each of the players from both teams.|$|E

40|$|A morphometric {{study of}} the {{proximal}} radius was performed with computed tomography scanning in 51 healthy adults. These dimensions were then {{compared with those of}} a commercially available floating radial head prosthesis. Results were expressed as mean values, SD, and minimum and maximum values. The minimum and maximum diameters of the radial head were 21. 9 +/- 1. 9 mm and 22. 9 +/- 1. 9 mm, respectively. The minimum and maximum intramedullary diameters of the radial neck were 8. 3 +/- 1. 3 mm and 9. 3 +/- 1. 5 mm, respectively. The combined length of the radial head and neck was 22. 47 +/- 2. 84 mm. The implications for prosthetic design are as follows: the small floating cup (19 mm in diameter) is too small for the large majority of adults, the large floating cup (22 mm in diameter) is closer to the radial anatomy, the mean values are significantly different between male and female patients, and a single component would suffice for right and <b>left</b> <b>elbows.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 49 -year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia and {{significant}} alcohol intake.

40|$|ABSTRACTTo {{evaluate}} patients undergoing arthroscopic {{release of}} a stiff elbow, with discussion of the technique, possible difficulties and risks. Methods: Twenty-four elbow arthroscopy procedures were performed. All the patients were evaluated using goniometry before the operation and six months afterwards and were rated using the Mayo elbow performance score (MEPS). Results: Fifteen men and nine women underwent surgery (14 right <b>elbows</b> and ten <b>left</b> <b>elbows).</b> Their mean age was 34. 58 years and length of follow-up, 38. 41 months. Their mean gain of range of motion was 43. 3 ° and of MEPS, 85. 4. Conclusion: Arthroscopic release might enable better intra-articular viewing and enhance the options for changing strategy during surgery, reducing surgical trauma and enabling early rehabilitation. This technique can reach similar or better results than open surgery. The disadvantages of arthroscopy are the long learning curve and higher cost of the procedure. Neurovascular complications are reported with both techniques. To avoid such problems, the protocol for portal construction must be rigorously followed. Arthroscopic release was {{shown to be a}} safe and effective option for achieving range-of-motion gains in cases of post-traumatic stiff elbow...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Supracondylar humerus {{fractures}} are {{the most}} common type of fractures involving the elbow region in children. Open reduction is a successful method for the management of displaced supracondylar fractures, with the most important advantages being complete anatomical reduction by visualising the fracture line and the lower level of risk for iatrogenic neurovascular injuries. In the present study, we assessed outcomes of open reduction and cross-pinning employed in the surgical management of paediatric Gartland type III supracondylar humerus fractures. Material and Method: The study included 18 children with Gartland extension type III supracondylar humerus fractures (13 boys, 5 girls; mean age: 7. 3 ± 2. 02 years; range, 3 %u 201312). There were fractures in the right elbows of 11 patients (61. 1 %) and in the <b>left</b> <b>elbows</b> of seven (38. 8 %). The mean operative time was 53. 3 ± 8. 5 minutes (range, 45 %u 201370). The mean length of hospital stay was 1. 7 ± 0. 75 days (range, 1 %u 20133), while the mean follow-up time was 2. 2 ± 0. 6 years (range, 1. 5 %u 20134). Results: According to the Flynn criteria, excellent results were obtained in six patients (33. 3 %), and good results in 12 (61. 7 %) regarding changes in the carrying angle of the elbow. Functional assessment results were excellent for 14 patients (77. 7 %) and good for four (22. 3 %) regarding their loss of joint movement. Radiographic examinations revealed an average Baumann%u 2019 s angle of 75. 6 ° (range, 70 %u 201385). Discussion: Good clinical outcomes can be achieved through the management of Gartland extension type III supracondylar humerus fractures using the open reduction technique. The most important disadvantage, however, is the post-surgical appearance of the elbow incision scar...|$|R
