5000|$|LH is {{available}} mixed with FSH {{in the form}} of menotropin, and other forms of urinary gonadotropins. More purified forms of urinary gonadotropins may reduce the LH portion in relation to FSH. Recombinant LH {{is available}} as <b>lutropin</b> <b>alfa</b> (Luveris). [...] All these medications have to be given parenterally. They are commonly used in infertility therapy to stimulate follicular development, the notable one being in IVF therapy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to determine if follitropin alfa (recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone; r-hFSH) and <b>lutropin</b> <b>alfa</b> (recombinant human luteinizing hormone; r-hLH) biopotencies were unchanged by reconstituting in sterile water for injection and mixing prior to injection. Methods The biopotencies of r-hFSH and r-hLH were determined following injection of female Sprague-Dawley rats with a mixture of follitropin alfa revised formulation female (RFF) and <b>lutropin</b> <b>alfa</b> (1 : 1, r-hFSH:r-hLH). Biopotencies of follitropin alfa RFF and <b>lutropin</b> <b>alfa</b> were measured using ovarian weight and ascorbic acid depletion assays, respectively, and compared with a reference standard. Stock mixtures of follitropin alfa RFF and <b>lutropin</b> <b>alfa</b> (1 : 1) were prepared within 1 h prior to each respective assay's injection and stored at 6 +/- 2 °C. Separate low dose (follitropin alfa RFF 1. 5 IU/rat, <b>lutropin</b> <b>alfa</b> 2 IU/rat) and high dose (follitropin alfa RFF 3 IU/rat, <b>lutropin</b> <b>alfa</b> 8 IU/rat) treatments were prepared from stock mixtures or individual solutions by diluting with 0. 22 % bovine serum albumin saline solution and injected within 1 h of preparation. The main outcome measures were ovarian weight and ovarian ascorbic acid depletion. Results FSH bioactivities were similar (p > 0. 10) between the individual follitropin alfa RFF test solution (84. 2 IU) and follitropin alfa RFF/lutropin alfa (87. 6 IU) mixtures prepared within 1 h of injection and stored at 6 +/- 2 °C. LH bioactivities were similar (p > 0. 10) between <b>lutropin</b> <b>alfa</b> (94. 7 IU) test solution and lutropin alfa/follitropin alfa RFF (85. 3 IU) mixtures prepared within 1 h of injection and stored at 6 +/- 2 °C for not more than 1 h prior to injection. Conclusion Mixing follitropin alfa RFF and <b>lutropin</b> <b>alfa</b> did not alter the bioactivity of either FSH or LH. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Gonadotrophins are {{routinely}} administered in assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment protocols. Recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone (r-hFSH; follitropin alfa) and recombinant human luteinizing hormone (r-hLH; <b>lutropin</b> <b>alfa)</b> can be administered individually or in a fixed combination. The ability to vary the FSH to LH dose ratio {{in a single}} injection without compromising the bioactivity of either gonadotrophin or generating losses of active principle is important for physicians and patients alike. Methods This study investigated whether follitropin alfa (GONAL-f (R)), as lyophilized powder for reconstitution or solution from the GONAL-f (R) (filled-by-mass [FbM]) Prefilled Pen, {{could be used to}} reconstitute Pergoveris TM (follitropin alfa/lutropin alfa 150 IU/ 75 IU) lyophilized powder. In Ratio Groups 1 and 2, the r-hFSH:r-hLH ratio was 3 : 1; in Ratio Groups 3 and 4, the ratios of r-hFSH:r-hLH were 5 : 1 and 8 : 1, respectively. The protein content and bioactivity of each mixed solution were evaluated. The r-hFSH and r-hLH content was determined using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The biological activity of r-hFSH and r-hLH was assessed using the Steelman-Pohley and Van Hell in vivo bioassays in rats, respectively. Results Follitropin alfa/lutropin alfa 150 IU/ 75 IU lyophilized powder could be successfully mixed with follitropin alfa 75 IU FbM solution that was either reconstituted from lyophilized powder or injected directly from the prefilled pen to create solutions with ratios of r-hFSH and r-hLH from 3 : 1 to 8 : 1. The measured content of r-hFSH and r-hLH corresponded favourably with the target protein content in Ratio Groups 1 – 4. The in vivo target and measured bioactivity of r-hFSH and r-hLH were also closely matched in all Ratio Groups. Conclusion Follitropin alfa lyophilized powder or solution can be accurately mixed with follitropin alfa/lutropin alfa 150 IU/ 75 IU lyophilized powder to enable physicians to administer ratios of r-hFSH and r-hLH in the IU range from 3 : 1 to 8 : 1. Mixing of recombinant formulations offers flexibility for patients receiving follitropin alfa and <b>lutropin</b> <b>alfa</b> for ART protocols in clinical practice. </p...|$|E
40|$|Gonadotropin therapy {{plays an}} {{integral}} role in ovarian stimulation for infertility treatments. Efforts {{have been made}} {{over the last century}} to improve gonadotropin preparations. Undoubtedly, current gonadotropins have better quality and safety profiles as well as clinical efficacy than earlier ones. A major achievement has been introducing recombinant technology in the manufacturing processes for follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and human chorionic gonadotropin. Recombinant gonadotropins are purer than urine-derived gonadotropins, and incorporating vial filling by mass virtually eliminated batch-to-batch variations and enabled accurate dosing. Recombinant and fill-by-mass technologies have been the driving forces for launching of prefilled pen devices for more patient-friendly ovarian stimulation. The most recent developments include the fixed combination of follitropin alfa + <b>lutropin</b> <b>alfa,</b> long-acting FSH gonadotropin, and a new family of prefilled pen injector devices for administration of recombinant gonadotropins. The next step would be the production of orally bioactive molecules with selective follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone activity...|$|E
