40|$|Background: Although {{anterior}} shoulder dislocation is {{the most}} prevalent type of body dislocation, irreducible anterior shoulder dislocation is seldom reported in the literature, which is usually due to physical obstacles. Objectives: This study presents our findings regarding the causes of irreducibility of anterior shoulder dislocation associated with displaced fracture of the greater tuberosity. Patients and Methods: CT scans, open reduction of the joint, and internal fixation of the tuberosity was performed in seven patients with irreducible anterior shoulder dislocation associated with displaced fracture of the greater tuberosity. Results: As confirmed by intraoperative findings, the CT scans showed the cause of irreducible shoulder dislocation in six cases was the interposition of the long head of biceps (LHB) in the anterior of the head that was displaced from the fracture line between the greater and <b>lesser</b> <b>tuberosities.</b> In another case, the greater and <b>lesser</b> <b>tuberosities</b> were attached {{to each other and}} were separated from the head. This fractured part was trapped. Conclusions: We suggest that performing CT scans in all cases of anterior shoulder dislocations with displaced fracture of the greater tuberosity can help surgeons to diagnose the accompanying fractures and possible complications, such as irreducibility. If the fracture line passes through the bicipital groove {{or in the case of}} a shield fracture, possible irreducibility should be borne in mind...|$|R
40|$|SummaryMalunion of a {{proximal}} humerus fracture {{is difficult}} to manage once bone union has been achieved in a wrong position. Malunion may be encountered after conservative treatment or internal fixation of fractures, and also around a joint prosthesis. The malunion can involve the greater and <b>lesser</b> <b>tuberosities,</b> humeral head, bicipital groove, or the entire epiphysis. The nature of the malunion must be precisely characterized. Malunion can affect bone structures and the articular surface; any resulting displacements must be carefully measured. Clinical assessments will help to evaluate the functional repercussions and determine the need for correction. Radiographic imaging and CT scan guide the treatment plan. Arthroscopic surgery (acromioplasty or tuberoplasty) {{can be used to}} treat biceps tenosynovitis or impingement syndrome in cases where full correction of the malunion is not required.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{treatment}} of fracture-dislocation of the shoulder, {{in which the}} greater and <b>lesser</b> <b>tuberosities</b> are fractured and a large capital fragment is dislocated are not usually very good (Neer, Brown and McLaughlin 1953; Knight and Mayne 1957). The production of this four-fragment fracture, as described by Codman (1934), makes closed reduction hard to achieve and open reduction very difficult.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to retrospectively evaluate the association between abnormalities of the <b>lesser</b> <b>tuberosity</b> and subscapularis tendon lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cortical irregularities and cysts of the <b>lesser</b> <b>tuberosity</b> were evaluated on radiographs and MR images in 70 patients: 31 with normal subscapularis tendons and 39 with subscapularis tendon tears. These imaging findings were correlated with subscapularis tendon tears diagnosed during arthroscopy and with fatty atrophy of the subscapularis muscle seen on MR images. Correlations between imaging findings, patient age, history of trauma, and the reference standards were assessed using gamma coefficients. Interreader agreement was calculated using kappa values. RESULTS: For the diagnosis of subscapularis tendon tears, the sensitivity of cortical irregularities and cysts on radiographs was 44 %/ 51 % (reader 1 /reader 2) and 21 %/ 21 %, respectively; specificity was 65 %/ 68 % and 87 %/ 87 %. The sensitivity of cortical irregularities and cysts on MRI was 64 %/ 72 % and 36 %/ 39 %. Specificity was 48 %/ 45 % and 81 %/ 77 %. For fatty atrophy of the subscapularis muscle, the sensitivity of cortical irregularities and cysts on radiographs was 67 %/ 73 % and 17 %/ 27 %, respectively; the specificity was 63 %/ 63 % and 83 %/ 85 %.

30|$|Under general anesthesia, {{the patient}} was placed in beach-chair {{position}} on a radiolucent operating table. A longitudinal skin incision was made along the greater tuberosity of the humerus. The deltoid muscle was bluntly split to expose the rotator cuff. In cases of 2 -part (surgical neck) fracture, a Kirschner pin was inserted through the rotator cuff, and its position was confirmed by C-arm. A 10  mm longitudinal incision was made on the supraspinatus tendon right medial to the greater tuberosity and the entry portal of the nail was created with a drill and enlarged with a hand reamer. While maintaining fracture reduction by manual manipulation, a 2.0 -mm guide wire was passed across the fracture and then the nail was inserted correctly. Finally, the nail was locked proximally and distally. In cases of 3 - or 4 -part fracture, the rotated or displaced articular fragment was reduced first and lined up with the shaft fragment. The entry portal of the nail was created on the articular fragment carefully, not to crack the articular fragment. Next, the displaced greater or <b>lesser</b> <b>tuberosity</b> fragment was identified and reduced. One suture inserted on the supraspinatus tendon pulled out the greater tuberosity fragment.

40|$|Background: Several {{modalities}} {{of treatment}} {{are being used}} {{for the management of}} proximal humerus fractures. Primary hemiarthroplasty in proximal humerus fracture is indicated in three or four part fracture or fracture dislocations. It is also indicated if fracture involves a large area of articular cartilage loss and viability of head is doubtful. We studied the functional outcome of hemiarthroplasty in comminuted proximal humerus fracture. Materials and Methods: 29 patients of three or four part proximal humerus fractures, (according to Neer's classification) who underwent primary shoulder hemiarthroplasty were included in this retrospective study. 20 patients were of more than 55 years of age. Functional evaluation based on Constant score and radiological assessment by periodic X-rays were done. All patients were operated in a 'beach chair position'. The <b>lesser</b> and greater <b>tuberosities</b> were dissected with their tendinous attachments and were later reattached to the proximal humerus for stability of the prosthesis. Cemented prosthesis was used in all cases. Results: Three patients died and two patients were lost to followup {{during the course of the}} study, so 24 patients were finally included in the study. Mean Constant score was 56. 62 (range 42. 5 - 65. 5) after mean followup of 18. 28 months (range 12 - 24 months). Mean anterior elevation was 118. 2 ° (range 75 °- 150 °) and mean active abduction was 102 °(range 50 °- 135 °). Nineteen patients (79. 16 %) were satisfied about their functional outcome. Proximal migration of tuberosity was present in four patients. These patients had decreased abduction with impingement. One patient had higher placement of prosthesis and one patient had radiolucency at bone cement interface. There were no heterotopic ossification, dislocation, superficial, or deep infection.

40|$|Introduction Combined {{displaced}} fractures of {{the lesser}} humeral tuberosity and the scapular spine are highly uncommon {{and have not}} been previously reported in literature. Case presentation: The authors report a novel case of a 24 year-old male who sustained displaced fractures of the lesser humeral tuberosity and the scapular spine.

30|$|To {{explore the}} shoulder, anteroposterior views with three {{projections}} (neutral, {{external and internal}} rotation), an axillary view, and a scapular “Y” view must be performed. The axillary view can show alterations of the <b>lesser</b> <b>tuberosity,</b> such as irregularities or cysts, which argue in favour of a SSC tendon lesion [21]. Anterior subluxation of the humeral head {{can also be seen}} on this view [22]. The “Y” view is helpful to locate tendinous calcifications and to look for a narrow subcoracoid space, which can both lead to coracoid impingement (see below).|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that tenotomy and repair of the subscapularis tendon carried out for anterior approaches to the shoulder can be followed by failure of the tendon repair and by changes resulting in permanent loss of subscapularis function. We hypothesized that release of the subscapularis with use of a superficial osteotomy of the <b>lesser</b> <b>tuberosity</b> followed by repair of the two opposing bone surfaces would lead to consistent bone-to-bone healing, which would be possible to monitor radiographically, and would lead to satisfactory clinical and structural outcomes. METHODS: Thirty-nine shoulders in thirty-six consecutive patients who, at an average age of fifty-seven years, had undergone total shoulder replacement through an anterior approach involving an osteotomy of the <b>lesser</b> <b>tuberosity</b> were evaluated at an average of thirty-nine months. Assessment included a standardized interview and physical examination, scoring according to the system described by Constant and Murley, and imaging with conventional radiography and computed tomography to assess healing of the osteotomy site and changes in the subscapularis. RESULTS: The osteotomized tuberosity fragment healed in an anatomical position in all shoulders, and no cuff tendon ruptures were observed. At the time of follow-up, thirty-three (89 %) of thirty-seven shoulders evaluated with a belly-press test had a negative result and twenty-seven (75 %) of thirty-six shoulders evaluated with a lift-off test had an unequivocally normal result. Fatty infiltration of the subscapularis muscle increased after the operation (p < 0. 0001) and was at least stage two in eleven (32 %) of thirty-four shoulders. The fatty infiltration had progressed by one stage in eight (24 %) of the thirty-four shoulders, by two stages in five shoulders (15 %), and by three stages in two shoulders (6 %). CONCLUSIONS: Osteotomy of the <b>lesser</b> <b>tuberosity</b> provides an easy anterior approach for total shoulder replacement and is followed by consistent bone-to-bone healing, which can be monitored, and good subscapularis function. In the presence of documented anatomical healing of the osteotomy site, postoperative fatty infiltration of the subscapularis muscle remains unexplained and needs to be investigated further as it is associated with a poorer clinical outcome...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{absence of}} a {{coherent}} classification system has hampered communication about the treatment and outcomes of {{the various types of}} subscapularis tendon lesions. In addition, a reliable classification system allows comparisons of epidemiological and therapeutic data. The classification systems used until now fail to incorporate the radiological and intraoperative abnormalities of the bicipital sling, and they do not consider the degree of subscapularis tendon cleavage. Here, we describe a new arthroscopy-based classification system intended for therapeutic and prognostic purposes. MethodsA prospective multicentre study sponsored by the French Society for Arthroscopy was conducted from March 2010 to January 2011 in 150 isolated subscapularis lesions with or without limited anterosuperior involvement. The bicipital sling and insertion of the deep subscapularis layer were routinely investigated by arthroscopy with video recording. Each lesion was classified after a consensus was reached among four surgeons. ResultsWe identified four lesion types based on the bicipital sling findings. Type I was defined as partial separation of the subscapularis tendon fibres from the <b>lesser</b> <b>tuberosity</b> with a normal bicipital sling. Type II consisted of a partial subscapularis tear at the <b>lesser</b> <b>tuberosity</b> attachment combined with partial injury to the anterior wall of the bicipital sling, without injury to the superior glenohumeral ligament. Type III was complete separation of the subscapularis fibres from the <b>lesser</b> <b>tuberosity</b> with extensive cleavage of the bicipital sling. Finally, in Type IV, all the subscapularis fibres were detached and, in some cases, conjunction of the subscapularis and supraspinatus fibres produced the comma sign. Nearly all the lesions identified intraoperatively during the study fit one of these four types. DiscussionA reproducible classification system that allows different surgeons to establish comparable homogeneous patient groups is useful for both therapeutic and prognostic purposes. We defined four types of subscapularis lesions that are easy to identify as either isolated lesions or combined with anterosuperior rotator cuff tears. Long head of biceps tendon abnormalities and fatty degeneration of the shoulder muscles can be added to our classification system. Studies of intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility are needed to complete the process of validating the diagnostic and/or prognostic usefulness of this new classification scheme.

The etiologies were: epilepsy in 9 patients, a traffic accident in 2 patients, and fall in 2 patients. To assess the patients' functional level, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Constant Scores were used, and the patients' range of motion at the last follow-up was measured. To evaluate the development of arthrosis, the final follow-up control plain radiographs were examined. The average size of the defects calculated from the axial computed tomography sets was 27 % (range: 20 %– 40 %). Results: The average length of follow-up was 30 months (range: 12 – 67 months). At the last follow-up visit, the main ASES and Constant Scores were 78 and 85, respectively, and the average degrees of flexion, abduction, and external rotation were 163 °, 151 °, and 70 ° respectively.

30|$|An {{accurate}} and a traumatic shoulder arthrography technique {{is essential to}} avoid false images of SSC tendon lesions. The anterior approach targeting the rotator cuff interval under ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance is currently the most widely performed technique [23], even if a posterior approach {{makes it possible to}} avoid any iatrogenic contamination of the SSC tendon or the SASD bursa. Ten to twelve cc of contrast medium (dilution of gadolinium at 0.0025  mmol/L) are injected into the glenohumeral joint. The MRA acquisition protocol includes FS T 1 -weighted in three planes (or a 3 D-FS-T 1 w), a coronal FS T 2 -weighted or PD-weighted sequence, and a T 1 -weighted sagittal sequence. In healthy patients, the contrast agent surrounds the articular surface of the SSC tendon, and underlines the LHBT in its groove, without any leak of contrast agent in front of the <b>lesser</b> <b>tuberosity,</b> or in the SASD bursa.|$|E
40|$|Shoulder {{injuries}} {{are common in}} athletic adolescents; however, rotator cuff tears are infrequently seen. Isolated subscapularis tears without a history of dislocation and without associated avulsions of the <b>lesser</b> <b>tuberosity</b> are rare. 5 CASE REPORT A 13 -year-old right-hand-dominant boy (5 ft 9 in, 130 lb) presented after football practice complaining of shoulder pain. He recalled making a tackle while sustaining a second posterior impact to his abducted, extended arm. He denied any previous shoulder injuries. On examination, he held his right arm near his body with the elbow flexed. No gross deformities were seen. He was tender to palpation along the proximal anterolateral humerus. He {{was not able to}} actively abduct, externally rotate, or internally rotate his arm but had full passive range of motion. Pain prevented adequate testing of shoulder girdle strength or other special tests. He possessed normal strength with grip, wrist flexion and extension, an...|$|E
