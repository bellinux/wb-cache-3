However, few, if any, Chinese information extraction systems make full use of <b>space</b> <b>characters.</b> However, it seems that treatment of <b>space</b> <b>characters</b> is necessary, especially in cases of extracting information from semi-structured documents. This investigation aims to address the importance of <b>space</b> <b>characters</b> in Chinese information extraction by parsing some semi-structured documents with two similar grammars- one with treatment for <b>space</b> <b>characters,</b> the other ignoring it. This paper also introduces two post processing filters to further improve treatment of <b>space</b> <b>characters.</b> Results show that the grammar that takes account of spaces clearly out-performs the one that ignores them, and so concludes that <b>space</b> <b>characters</b> can play a useful role in information extraction. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} question {{discussed in}} this dissertation {{is the problem of}} characterizing the linear and convex functions on generalized <b>line</b> <b>spaces.</b> A linear function is shown to be a convex function. The linear and convex functions are characterized, that is, a function f:[right arrow] X? is linear [convex] if and only if f[subscript l] is linear [convex] in the usual sense on each line of a generalized <b>line</b> <b>space</b> X. We prove that if a function has at least one support at each point on its graph, then it is a convex function. In the first chapter the basic concepts of abstract convexity spaces are introduced. The next chapter is concerned with join systems which are shown to be examples of abstract convexity spaces. On the other hand, a domain-finite, join-hull commutative abstract convexity space with regular straight segments satisfies the axioms of a join system. Consequently, such abstract convexity spaces satisfy the separation property. In Chapter III, the linearization of abstract spaces is done using a linearization family. The following chapter is on generalized <b>line</b> <b>spaces</b> and graphically it is shown that Pasch?s and Peano's axioms do not hold in a certain generalized <b>line</b> <b>space.</b> It is also proved that the separation property may not hold, in general, in a generalized <b>line</b> <b>space.</b> Finally, the convex and linear functions are studied on generalized <b>line</b> <b>spaces.</b> The linearization of generalized <b>line</b> <b>spaces</b> is done by means of the properties of a linearization family...|$|R
