25|$|An Advanced Laser Warning Countermeasure System (ALWCS) for {{the fire}} control system has been developed. This {{consists}} of a <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system,</b> Infra-Red (IR) jammer and aerosol smoke grenade system. This is being developed jointly with Elbit Systems Limited of Israel. The ALWCS has been integrated on Arjun MBT and trials have been carried out.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the Soviet Army began {{development}} of the Shtora-1 electro-optical jammer. [...] It was first mounted on a T-80U in 1989, and later showcased on a T-72B (renamed T-72BM and later T-90). [...] Shtora-1 is designed to jam incoming anti-tank missiles using a one-kilowatt infrared radiator. [...] In 1995, it was fitted on a Ukrainian T-84. [...] The Shtora-1 system consists of an infra-red radiator interface station, composed of the jammer, modulator and control panel, a number of forward-firing grenade discharges capable of producing a smoke screen, a laser-warning system and a general control panel. [...] Shtora offers 360 degree all-around protection, between the elevations of −5 and 25 degrees. [...] The system is activated when the <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> alerts the tank commander, who responds by pressing a button on his control panel which automatically orients the turret towards the threat. [...] This triggers the grenade launch, creating a smoke screen to reduce {{the ability of the}} missile to lock-on the vehicle. [...] The jammers are designed to jam the infra-red seekers on the inbound missiles. [...] According to the manufacturers, Shtora decreases the chances of a tank being hit by an anti-tank missile, such as the Dragon, by a factor of 4–5:1.|$|E
2500|$|Ajeya upgrade (...) : upgrade for the T-72 fleet, {{incorporating}} {{a mix of}} locally made and imported subsystems. 250 have been ordered. Local systems include the DRDO-developed ERA, a DRDO-developed <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> and combat net radio, the Bharat Electronics Limited advanced land navigation system consisting of fibre optic gyros and GPS, NBC protection and DRDO's fire detection and suppression system amongst other items. Imported systems include a compact thermal imager and fire control system and a new 1000hp engine.|$|E
25|$|The AH-1Z has {{survivability}} equipment {{including the}} Hover Infrared Suppression System (HIRSS) to cover engine exhausts, countermeasure dispensers, radar warning, missile <b>warning,</b> and <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
25|$|Other EW {{projects}} {{revealed by}} the DRDO include the MAWS project (a joint venture by the DRDO and EADS) which leverages EADS hardware and DRDO software to develop MAWS systems for transport, helicopter and fighter fleets. DRDO also has <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> available.|$|R
40|$|Laser {{assisted}} weapons, such as laser guided bombs, laser guided {{missiles and}} laser beam-riding missiles pose a significant threat to military {{assets in the}} modern battlefield. Laser beam-riding missiles are particularly hard to detect because they use low power <b>lasers.</b> Most <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> produced so far can not detect laser beam-riding missiles because of their weak emissions which have signals less than 1 % of laser range finder power. They are even harder to defeat because current counter-measures are not designed to work against this threat. 	The aim of this project {{is to examine the}} vulnerability of <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> against guided weapons, to build an evaluation tool for <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> sensors (LWS) and seekers, and try to find suitable counter-measures for laser beam-riding missiles that use low power lasers in their guidance systems. The project comes about because of the unexpected results obtained from extensive field trials carried out on various LWRs in the United Arab Emirates desert, where severe weather conditions may be experienced. The objective was to help find a solution for these systems to do their job in protecting the tanks and armoured vehicles crews from such a threat. In order to approach the subject, a computer model has been developed to enable the assessment of all phases of a <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> receiver and missile seeker. MATLAB & SIMULINK software have been used to build the model. During this process experimentation and field trials have been carried out to verify the reliability of the model. This project will enable both the evaluation and design of any generic <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> receiver or missile seeker and specific systems if various parameters are known. Moreover, this model will be used as a guide to the development of reliable countermeasures for laser beam-riding missiles...|$|R
2500|$|T-72M4 CZ: the Czech T72M4 CZ is a {{comprehensive}} upgrade of {{every aspect of the}} T-72M1 resulting in a tank that only superficially resembles the precursor. The automotive performance was enhanced with a Perkins CV12-1000 1,000hp (740kW) water-cooled diesel engine coupled to an Allison XTG-411-6 automatic transmission. All drive train work was done by the Israeli firm NIMDA and involved extensive modification of the tank's hull and the driver's compartment. The upgrade added new Czech-manufactured Dyna-72 ERA for protection against HEAT and kinetic rounds impacting the frontal aspects of the turret and hull, and against top-attack ATGMs and sub-munitions with ERA tiles covering the turret roof. Survivability is enhanced with the Polish-made Obra <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> integrated with a series of DGO-1 smoke grenade dischargers on each side of turret, a Deugra fire suppression system, REDA NBC suite and electromagnetic mine plow. The most important improvement in firepower comes from the use of the Galileo Avionica TURMS-T computerized FCS (it is similar to that used in C1 Ariete) which enables a [...] "hunter-killer" [...] mode of operation; the commander has a panoramic day/night sight with built-in laser rangefinder and Attila thermal camera and can engage targets independently, while the gunner has his own primary sight with thermal channel. The FCS has sensors that correct for thermal distortion of the barrel, the temperature of the ammunition propellant, meteorological conditions, totaling 22 sensor clusters installed at several points on the turret. A new 125/EPpSV-97 APFSDS round was developed for use with the new tank which can defeat 540mm of RHA at 2,000 m. The Czech tanks were also equipped with a rear-view camera, a new intercom, navigational system, the DITA 72/97B auto-diagnostic system and improvements to the suspension due to the increase in the weight of the T-72M4 CZ by 4 tonnes. Curiously, the obsolete 2A46 main gun was retained as was the original 2E28M stabilization system, which was modestly upgraded with new hydraulic drives and gyroscopic sensors, resulting in only marginal improvements in first-hit probability despite the sophisticated and expensive TURMS-T FCS. The published probability of hitting a stationary target on the move is said to be between 65-75% with the first fired round. In comparison, the Leopard 2A4 from the mid-1980s can achieve a first round hit probability on the move of 75-85% at 2,000 m and as high as 90% with a skilled crew. The original tender called for an order of 350 tanks, which was downgraded to 140 in the face of dwindling defense budgets and finally amounted to a commitment for only 35 tanks to be upgraded to the T-72M4 CZ standard. One of the reasons for this drastic reduction was due to the escalating unit cost of the upgrade—from an initial estimate of 3.7M—and closing on a final cost of US$5.2M per tank. The reliance on foreign components and labour has also taken the original Czech contractor to the verge of bankruptcy, and the program is considered a failure by analysts according to cost-effectiveness metrics.|$|E

2500|$|Combat Improved Ajeya For {{a rather}} long time the Indian Army {{did not intend}} to {{modernize}} its T-72 tanks since it was relying on their own tank project the Arjun. However, the Arjun program had been undergoing difficulties. As a result, they adopted the Operation Rhino plan aimed at re-equipping 1,500 T-72M1 tanks. The upgrade program provides for installation of a Polish SKO-1T DRAWA-T fire control system/thermal imager supplied by the Polish PCO/Cenzin (from PT-91 Twardy), DRDO explosive reactive armour, a navigation system from Israel's Tamam, German Litef or South African RDI, a locally developed <b>laser</b> illumination <b>warning</b> <b>system,</b> new radios manufactured by Tadiran or GES Marconi and an improved NBC protection system will be fitted. The tank is planned to be powered by a [...] S-1000 engine made by the Polish firm PZL-Wola (also from PT-91 Twardy). It is also upgraded with new fire detection and suppression <b>systems</b> and <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> {{on either side of the}} turret. Indian sources often say that 1,800–2,000 T-72M1 tanks will be upgraded top to bottom while the rest will undergo only partial improvement.|$|R
50|$|Al-Zarrar uses modular {{composite}} armour and {{explosive reactive armour}} to give improved {{protection from}} anti-tank missiles, mines and other weapons. The Pakistani ATCOP LTS-1 <b>laser</b> threat <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> is fitted to inform the tank crew if the tank is targeted by a laser range-finder or laser designator. Smoke grenade launchers are fitted {{to the sides of}} the turret. An automatic fire-extinguishing and explosion suppression system is installed to improve crew survivability.|$|R
50|$|The optics {{and fire}} control system was {{developed}} by Fotona, a Slovenian company, and now comes as standard on all current Croatian and Slovene M-84 tanks. The Vihor/M95 tank received new laser range finder, LIRD-4B - a <b>laser</b> irradiation <b>warning</b> <b>system.</b> A Fotona/Končar/Đuro Đaković digital battlefield computer has also been added to improve battlefield performance. Diehl provided new tracks giving the tank better performance {{both on and off}} road.|$|R

50|$|In May 2005, NORAD {{started using}} a <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> to warn pilots that cross into {{restricted}} airspace. The bright laser beams, which flash red-red-green, are easily seen, even during daylight. The laser beams {{can be seen}} 15 to 20 miles away. Other pilots are unlikely to see the lasers because, when activated, the directional beams are pointed at the aircraft that has crossed into restricted airspace. Multiple lasers could be activated. These lasers do not harm the eyes of aircrew or passengers.|$|E
2500|$|T-72 Wilk: {{beginning}} in 1986, the Polish T-72 Wilk project was instituted to allow tank repair plants to upgrade T-72 tanks {{within their own}} facilities. In particular, it was proposed that the Soviet-made Volna fire control system {{be replaced by the}} Czechoslovak-made Kladivo FCS or by the Polish SKO-1 Mérida, which was originally designed for T-55AM [...] "Merida". Besides the new FCS, the Radomka passive night vision devices were installed in the driver's compartment, as was the Liswarta night sight, Obra <b>laser</b> illumination <b>warning</b> <b>system,</b> Tellur anti-laser smoke grenade launchers, solid or modular metal side skirts and the Polish-developed Erawa-1 or Erawa-2 explosive reactive armour was also fitted. This program was further developed and led to the PT-91.|$|R
50|$|The {{electronic}} warfare suite {{is designed to}} enhance combat survivability during deep penetration. The EW suite is developed by the Defence Avionics Research Establishment (DARE) {{with support from the}} Defence Electronics Research Laboratory (DLRL). This EW suite, known as Mayavi, includes a radar warning receiver (RWR), Missile Approach Warning (MAW) and a <b>Laser</b> <b>warning</b> receiver (LWR) <b>system,</b> Infrared & Ultraviolet Missile warning sensors, self-protection jammer, chaff, jaff and flares dispenser, an electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite and a towed radar decoy (TRD). In the interim, the Indian Ministry of Defence has revealed that an unspecified number of EW suites had been purchased from Israel's Elisra for the LCA prototypes.|$|R
50|$|The {{complete}} sensor suite and ECM comprises: 3D radar 'Top Steer', replaced {{later with}} 'Top Plate' (MR-760), 230 km range vs fighters and 50 km vs missiles {{and a total}} of 40 targets can be simultaneously tracked; Mineral system ('Band Stand') to allow the SS-N 22 guidance; 3 navigation and surface control radar MR-201 e 212; 2 'Bass Tilt' (MR-123) for CIWS; 6 'Front Dome'(MR-90) radar for SA-N-7 guidance (a very large arrangement to assure an effective defense against saturation attacks), linked with 3D radar and two SAM launcher (5 missile min each); 1 'Kite Screech' radar for 130 mm (MR-184 Lev). ECM and ESM are many: 2 ESM MR-410 or MP-405; 2 ECM MRP-11M or 12M ('Bell Shroud'), 2 'Bell Squat', 4 'Foot-ball B' and one MR-407; 2 PK-2M rocket launchers (140 mm), and 8 PK-10 (120 mm), 2-8 <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> receiver <b>systems</b> Spektr-F, one Squeeze Box (TV, laser and IR system).|$|R

50|$|K1M: Proposed export variant for Malaysia. In 1997, Malaysia {{expressed}} {{great interest}} in obtaining the K1, and the ROK responded by showing them the concept for K1M, which had several features not present in the baseline K1, including a <b>LASER</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> and an air conditioning unit. It was to weigh 49.7 tons, while the total ammunition capacity would {{have been reduced to}} 41 rounds. The ROK offered a contract for 210 K1M's, but Malaysia responded that it was too many, and chose to go with Polish PT-91M in 2003.|$|E
50|$|When {{compared}} to the K1A1 tank, the K2's main gun reloads quicker and reaches targets faster. Although both are 120 mm, the K2's barrel is 1.3 m longer (6.6 m total length), resulting in a higher muzzle velocity of 1,400 m/s ({{compared to}} 1,140 m/s for the K1A1) for greater accuracy and armor penetration. Other features include the tank's ability to cross a 4 m-deep river, a posture control function that can lower its height by 40 cm, and a <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> that turns the turret towards the source of hostile fire almost instantaneously.|$|E
50|$|An {{advanced}} laser {{detection system}} from Al Technique Corporation (ATCOP) is present, the ATCOP LTS 1 <b>laser</b> threat <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> developed by Institute of Industrial Control Systems. LTS 1 {{consists of a}} mast-mounted sensor and operator's control box, which includes a display showing threats 360 degrees around the tank. It can detect laser rangefinders and laser target designators and responds automatically by triggering acoustic alarms, smoke generators and other countermeasure systems. LTS 1 can detect laser devices operating in the 0.8 to 1.06 µm waveband, has a 360° field of view in azimuth (resolution of 15°) and a field of view in elevation of -15° to +90°. Operating voltage is 12V or 24V DC nominal with power consumption being 8 W nominal. The sensor head is 165 mm in diameter and 35 mm high and the control box is 80 x 130 x 55 mm in size.|$|R
50|$|The AN/AAR-47 {{is a line}} {{of missile}} <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> by Loral and ATK Alliant Techsystems. The {{development}} of the original AN/AAR-47(V)1 began in 1983 by Loral. ATK became a second production source in the mid 90s and eventually became the prime contractor. In 1998 ATK began production of the improved AN/AAR-47(V)2 version, which added <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> functionality. As of 2005, over 5000 of these sets have been manufactured. In 2006, production of the AN/AAR-47A(V)2 began, also developed by ATK. It has further improved missile and <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> capabilities.|$|R
5000|$|LYRtech inc. (...) is {{a digital}} signal {{processing}} development company based in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.

5000|$|The {{guidance}} laser may {{be detected}} after the missile is fired, {{if the target}} aircraft {{is equipped with a}} suitable passive <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system.</b> In contrast, to detect a passively guided Infrared homing missile requires MAWS detectors with significant disadvantages: radar-based closure-detecting style MAWS radiate an easily detectable signal that reveals the aircraft and may be used as an auxiliary homing signal by AA missiles, and Infrared launch signature detector-based MAWS tend to be subject to a high false alarm rate, which reduces attention paid them by the pilot.|$|E
50|$|In {{the center}} of the hull is the two-man turret which mounts the Oerlikon Contraves 35 {{millimeter}} caliber dual-feed cannon with a cyclic rate of fire of approximately 200 rounds per minute, which is produced under license in Japan. Coaxially mounted to the cannon is a Type 74 7.62 millimeter caliber machine gun. The turret also mounts a single Type 79 Jyu-MAT missile {{on each side of the}} turret. Underneath the missile launcher is an array of three smoke grenade launchers. The gunner sits on the left of the turret, with the commander to his right with hatches that open to the rear. Both are provided with telescopic sights mounted on the front of the turret. The gunner has two vision periscopes that cover the front and left of the turret. The commander has six periscopes that provide all-round coverage. The turret is also fitted with a <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most helicopter-launched ATGWs have {{sufficient}} range {{that they can}} under the right conditions be fired at a range too long for the tank to retaliate with its own weapons. This may change with the Israelis fielding the Lahat missile that can be fired from the main gun of the Merkava MBT. With both anti-tank and anti-helicopter role, it does {{level the playing field}} somewhat. The Indian Arjun tank has also been modified to fire this missile. The People's Republic of China has developed 100 mm gun-launched missiles based on Russian designs such as the GP2 (based on the Russian Bastion). It has been reported to have successfully engaged aerial targets, as well as being an anti-tank missile. Similar missiles are available for Chinese tanks equipped with the 105 mm gun. The Russians have also displayed a similar if more advanced system in the Reflex. The system involves an automatic targeting of an aerial/land target instigated by a <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> {{receiver}} {{is a type}} of <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> used as {{a passive}} military defence. It detects, analyzes, and locates directions of laser emissions from laser guidance systems and laser rangefinders. Then it alerts the crew and can start various countermeasures, like smoke screen, aerosol screen (e.g. Shtora), active laser self-defence weapon with laser dazzler (LSDW, used on Type 99 China main battle tank), laser jammer, etc.|$|R
50|$|The LCH {{is to have}} a {{glass cockpit}} with {{multifunction}} displays, a target acquisition and designation system with FLIR, Laser rangefinder and laser designator. Weapons will be aimed with a helmet mounted sight and there will be an electronic warfare suite with radar <b>warning</b> receiver, <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> receiver and a missile approach <b>warning</b> <b>system.</b> The two pilots in the LCH sit one behind the other, compared to side-by-side in the Dhruv.|$|R
50|$|The turret is {{fitted with}} two six-barreled 81mm smoke grenade {{launchers}} and two four-barreled flare launchers. The system {{can create a}} thick smoke that blocks both vision and thermal imaging. The tank is also equipped with a smoke screen generator that is triggered by the driver. When activated, diesel fuel is injected into the hot exhaust, creating the thick smoke. The TR-85M1 is equipped with <b>laser</b> illumination <b>warning</b> sensors that can automatically trigger the GFM-76 smoke grenades and flares, thus disrupting the guidance systems of thermal and infrared guided missiles. The SAILR (Sistem de Avertizare la Iluminarea Laser și Radar, laser and radar illumination <b>warning</b> <b>system)</b> <b>laser</b> <b>warning</b> receiver can locate and identify the threat, warning the crew and triggering the DLC (Dispozitivul de Lansare Contramăsuri, Countermeasures Launching Device).|$|R
