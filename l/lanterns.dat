5|$|A {{more recent}} {{tradition}} (started in 1987) is Dunster by Candlelight {{which takes place}} every year on the first Friday and Saturday in December when this remarkably preserved medieval village turns its back on the present and lights its streets with candles. To {{mark the beginning of}} the festival on Friday at 5 pm, there is the Lantern Lighting Procession that starts on the Steep and continues through the village until all the <b>lanterns</b> in the streets have been lit. The procession of children and their families is accompanied by colourful stilt walkers in costumes who put up the <b>lanterns.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the modern industries upon which Gifu's economy rests, the city also has {{a wide array of}} traditional industries, which include traditional Gifu Fans, Mino washi and foods created from the ayu sweetfish.

There are approximately 15 businesses that make <b>lanterns</b> in the city, the largest of which is the Ozeki Lantern, Co.

5|$|On campaign, {{following}} {{the assembly of}} the various squadrons at fortified bases (aplēkta) along the coast, the fleet consisted of the main body, composed of the oared warships, and the baggage train (touldon) of sailing vessels and oared transports, which would be sent away {{in the event of}} battle. The battle fleet was divided into squadrons, and orders were transmitted from ship to ship through signal flags (kamelaukia) and <b>lanterns.</b>|$|E

5|$|Titanium alloys {{are used}} in {{spectacle}} frames that are rather expensive but highly durable, long lasting, light weight, and cause no skin allergies.

Titanium horseshoes are preferred to steel by farriers because it is lighter and more durable.|$|E

5|$|Galileo is lesser known for, {{yet still}} {{credited}} with, {{being one of}} the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having <b>lanterns</b> equipped with shutters, observe each other's <b>lanterns</b> at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E
5|$|Garrick {{built the}} temple on land {{adjoining}} a villa {{that he had}} bought in October 1754 {{to serve as a}} country retreat. The villa's riverside garden, a plot now known as Garrick's Lawn, was separated from the main property by the road from Kingston upon Thames to Staines. Garrick commissioned the building of an elaborate grotto-tunnel under the road, illuminated by 500 <b>lanterns,</b> to facilitate private access to the lawn from the house.|$|E
5|$|Local traditions include Lantern Night, {{which was}} held on 16 September and {{involved}} children in the town with candle <b>lanterns</b> made from hollowed out root vegetables such as Mangelwurzel or swede. It was the last remaining reminder of the Watchet Fair (also known as St Decuman's Fair). Another tradition is Queen Caturn's Day on the last Saturday of November. Watchet was famous for its blue dye and Queen Caturn was so impressed she bestowed the town's folk with cider and cakes {{as a reward for}} this. The tradition is carried on with costumes and celebrations.|$|E

50|$|When Hal {{makes the}} {{ultimate}} sacrifice and transforms into a Black <b>Lantern,</b> {{he uses the}} telepathy of the Indigo Tribe to open the Dead Zone portal. Green <b>Lantern</b> finally manages to escape and attacks Volthoom with the hordes of undead, but Volthoom effortlessly destroys the army and nearly possesses Green <b>Lantern.</b> After a Parallax-empowered Sinestro fails to kill Volthoom as well, Green <b>Lantern</b> proceeds to summon Nekron and finally destroys him. After the battle is over, Green <b>Lantern</b> is released from being a Black <b>Lantern</b> and returns to life as Green <b>Lantern</b> again, finally reuniting with Carol. Before departing, Sinestro reminds Green <b>Lantern</b> of a question {{he was about to}} ask him during their near-death back on Ysmault. Green <b>Lantern</b> asks if they had ever been truly friends, to which Sinestro replies that the tragedy is they always will be.|$|R

5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the film}} began in October 2012 with film's lead cast. The film was shot in Goa, Mumbai and Cape Town.

5|$|The {{interior}} of the church consists of a large, open floor plan, with wooden pews lined perpendicular {{to the north and}} south sides, thus creating a central aisle. The altar is a small wooden pulpit, which serves as a lectern that is accessible by a small wooden step; the altar is accented by a large wooden backdrop of casing with dentil molding. Each of the church's interior walls is covered with pine wainscot panelling and wallpaper, and topped with wooden crown molding. Wooden swag moldings accentuate the four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, the doorway's wooden casing, and the transom window. The wooden pews are simple, with cushions added for comfortable seating. The original ceiling is obscured by a dropped ceiling, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass chandeliers. Prior to the church's electrification, kerosene <b>lanterns</b> were used for light, and the <b>lanterns</b> remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original heart pine planks. Concrete blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's crawl space. Within the crawl space, log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.|$|E

5|$|The temple is a {{focal point}} of festivals of the Chinese {{community}} in Penang. The Chinese New Year celebrations are particularly impressive. For 30 days following Chinese New Year, the temple remains open until late at night whilst thousands of lights turn the scenery into a sea of light.

Another festive feature is the long marches undertaken by hundreds of monks from Thailand to the temple, once or twice in a year.|$|E
5|$|At 10:00a.m., Coast Guard {{stations}} and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Weather Bureau offices at Lake Superior ports raised white pennants above square red flags with black centers, indicating a storm warning with northwesterly winds.

(The word hurricane here does not refer to a tropical cyclone, but to Force 12 winds on the Beaufort scale.) The winds on Lake Superior had already reached 50mph (80km/h), and an accompanying blizzard was moving toward Lake Huron.|$|E
5|$|Because of the disappointing {{box office}} {{performances}} of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules, Disney restricted its marketing campaign for Mulan spending $30 million on promotional advertisements compared {{to more than}} $60 million for Hercules the year before. Instead of the lavish media event premieres of Pocahontas in Central Park and the electric light parade on Fifth Avenue for Hercules, Disney opted to premiere the film at the Hollywood Bowl complete with Chinese <b>lanterns</b> and fortune cookies. Two days before the general release, McDonald's launched its promotional campaign by including one of eight toys free with {{the purchase of a}} Happy Meal. The promotion also included Szechuan sauce for its Chicken McNuggets, which would be referenced in a 2017 episode of the Adult Swim series Rick and Morty and subsequently brought back by McDonald's as a promotional item related to that show.|$|E
