50|$|Rolled oats are {{traditionally}} oat groats {{that have been}} dehusked and steamed, before being rolled into flat flakes under heavy rollers and stabilized by being <b>lightly</b> <b>toasted.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} eaten {{immediately}} after cooking {{but it may}} also be eaten at room temperature, as in a celebratory bento (boxed lunch). Sekihan is traditionally eaten with gomashio (a mixture of <b>lightly</b> <b>toasted</b> sesame and salt).|$|E
50|$|Whole {{grains and}} cereals: Amaranth, barley, couscous, flax, oat, rice {{varieties}} such as basmati, brown rice, jasmine rice, quinoa, wheat, <b>lightly</b> <b>toasted</b> whole-grain Waffles, non-toasted whole grain breads (i.e. corn-bread, multi-cereal, 14 cereals, whole-wheat), al dente cooked pastas.|$|E
50|$|Melba toast {{is made by}} <b>lightly</b> <b>toasting</b> {{slices of}} bread under a grill, on both sides. The {{resulting}} toast is then sliced laterally. The thin slices are {{then returned to the}} grill with the untoasted sides towards the heat source, resulting in toast half the normal thickness. Thus, it can be described as a twice-baked food (see under rusk).|$|R
5000|$|The {{typically}} Castilian bread {{receives the}} name of [...] "Candeal bread", [...] "sobao o bregado" [...] ("sobao or labored"), because since remote times in Castile the wheat variety most used is the durum. It is a thin crust of bread and <b>lightly</b> <b>toast,</b> miga very white and compact with a fine texture and distinctive flavor. This type of bread is suitable to accompany red meats, stews or legumes accompanied by wines from the province. Traditionally it is made by hand, with an amassed slow fermentation and a prolonged, finished cooking in the wood-fired oven.|$|R
5000|$|Recipes often suggest <b>lightly</b> <b>toasting</b> {{the tiny}} seed pods, then {{crushing}} them before adding them to food. Only the husks are used; the shiny black seeds are discarded or ignored {{as they have}} a very gritty, sand-like texture. The spice is generally added at the last moment. Star anise and ginger are often used with it in spicy Sichuan cuisine. It has an alkaline pH and a numbing effect on the lips when eaten in larger doses. Ma la sauce ( [...] ; literally [...] "numbing and spicy"), common in Sichuan cooking, is a combination of Sichuan pepper and chili pepper, and it is a key ingredient in má là hot pot, the Sichuan version of the traditional Chinese dish. It is also a common flavouring in Sichuan baked goods such as sweetened cakes and biscuits. Beijing microbrewery Great Leap Brewing uses Sichuan peppercorns, offset by honey, as a flavouring adjunct in its Honey Ma Blonde.|$|R
50|$|The {{ingredients}} {{for the original}} 7.5% ABV recipe in 2001 included yellow muscat grapes, <b>lightly</b> <b>toasted</b> 2-row barley malt, thyme, honey and saffron. The {{ingredients for}} the 9% ABV recipe include barley, white Muscat grapes, honey and saffron.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{commonly}} consumed in Bolivia, {{where it is}} referred to as Sultana, and is made of sun-dried and <b>lightly</b> <b>toasted</b> coffee cherries. It may also be mixed with sticks of cinnamon. It is also called [...] "the poor man's coffee", and [...] "the coffee of the Army".|$|E
50|$|A mollete is a flatbread {{from the}} Andalusian region, in {{southern}} Spain. It is a soft round white bread, usually served <b>lightly</b> <b>toasted</b> {{with olive oil}} and raw garlic or spread with lard (usually in the forms of manteca colorá or zurrapa de lomo) in an Andalusian breakfast. The most famous are the ones from Antequera, Málaga.|$|E
50|$|Quesadilla: {{a grilled}} cheese sandwich, in which flour tortillas are {{used instead of}} bread. The Quesadilla is often <b>lightly</b> oiled and <b>toasted</b> on a griddle, to melt the cheese, then served with either salsa, pico de gallo, chile, guacamole and/or sour cream, as an appetizer or entree.|$|R
2500|$|The staves {{are then}} heated, {{traditionally}} {{over an open}} fire, and, when pliable, are bent into the desired shape of the barrel and held together with iron rings. Instead of fire, a cooper may use steam to heat up the staves but this tends to impart less [...] "toastiness" [...] and complexity to the resulting wine. Following the traditional, hand worked style, a cooper is typically able to construct one barrel in a day's time. Winemakers can order barrels with the wood {{on the inside of}} the barrel having been <b>lightly</b> charred or <b>toasted</b> with fire, medium toasted, or heavily toasted. Typically the [...] "lighter" [...] the toasting the more oak flavor and tannins that are imparted. Heavy toast or [...] "charred" [...] which is typical treatment of barrels in Burgundy wine have an added dimension from the char that medium or light toasted barrels do not impart. Heavy toasting dramatically reduces the coconut note lactones, even in American oak, but create a high carbon content that may reduce the coloring of some wines. During the process of toasting, the furanic aldehydes in the wood reach a higher level of concentration. This produces the [...] "roasted" [...] aroma in the wine. The toasting also enhances the presences of vanillin and the phenol eugenol which creates smokey and spicy notes that in some wines are similar to the aromatics of oil of cloves.|$|R
5000|$|Almonds can be {{processed}} into a milk substitute called almond milk; the nut's soft texture, mild flavour, and light colouring (when skinned) make for an efficient analog to dairy, and a soy-free choice for lactose intolerant people and vegans. Raw, blanched, and <b>lightly</b> <b>toasted</b> almonds {{work well for}} different production techniques, {{some of which are}} similar to that of soymilk and some of which use no heat, resulting in [...] "raw milk" [...] (see raw foodism).|$|E
50|$|Xacuti or Shagoti as is {{commonly}} known in Goa has it's origin in Harmal Arambol in Pernem Takula of Goa. Here fisherman in the olden day's {{used to get}} a fresh catch of fish or a local chiken and prepare a gravy for this dish. The gravy typically used local spices like Black Pepper Meerya, Chilli, Turmeric, onion, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Clove etc. The hero was a mildly roasted coconut kernel which is finely grated and <b>lightly</b> <b>toasted.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Special K is a <b>lightly</b> <b>toasted</b> {{breakfast cereal}} {{manufactured}} by the Kellogg Company. The cereal {{was introduced to}} the United States in 1955. [...] It is made primarily from rice and wheat. Special K is marketed primarily as a low-fat cereal that can be eaten to help one lose weight. The cereal frequently has give-away offers for various health and fitness products or contains dieting information {{on the back of the}} box. It is also generally targeted at adults, rather than children.|$|E
50|$|Kokkoh is {{an infant}} formula broth made from whole grains, seeds and legumes <b>lightly</b> <b>toasted</b> and {{ground to a}} powder. It was first brought to Western culture by Sakura Nyoichi, better known as George Ohsawa, {{as part of the}} Macrobiotic Diet, based a recipe widely used in {{traditional}} Japan. Brown rice is its primary and can be its only solid ingredient. Many kokkoh recipes include other whole grains, seeds and seasonings, most commonly sweet rice, azuki beans, sesame seeds, oats, barley, soybeans and kombu.|$|E
50|$|An old {{recipe for}} this dish {{contains}} chicken and pigeons, all stuffed and trussed, beef, veal, onion, parsnips, carrots, turnips, leeks, purslane, orach and chard. All are simmered for five hours. At {{the end of}} this time, slices of <b>lightly</b> <b>toasted</b> bread are placed {{in the bottom of a}} tureen and this is heated until the bread starts to stick to the bottom. The birds are removed from the soup and placed on the bread and the rest is strained over them. The remaining meat and vegetables are discarded.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the other}} {{well-known}} roads, the entire stretch is full with food hawkers and street vendors. There are vendors with little kerosene stoves making egg toasts—an omelette on a <b>lightly</b> <b>toasted</b> sliced bread and serving {{them with a}} cup of tea. Then there are little food stalls selling rolls - chicken roll, egg-chicken rolls etc. The ones in front of Jadavpur market are specially good! Then there is roti served with ghugny and aloor dom, shingara (Bengali breakfast samosas), muglai paratha (crispy bread stuffed with mince and fried), chow mein, chilli chicken, biryani, sweetmeats and, of course, chai (tea).|$|E
5000|$|Red Wilson Field is the {{official}} home of the Sinker Burger, the Hurler Burger, and the Boston Screamer. Introduced during the 2004 season, the Sinker is a hamburger served on a <b>lightly</b> <b>toasted</b> cake doughnut, with three varieties: inside, down-the-middle, and outside (cinnamon, powder, and plain). The Hurler, also introduced in 2004, is a hamburger patty served between the halves of a jelly doughnut, finished with a squirt of canned cheese. The Boston Screamer, which made its official debut in 2010, is a hamburger served on a Boston cream doughnut. On July 19, 2011, the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox served their 6000th [...] "upgraded" [...] hamburger.|$|E
50|$|Lettuce is {{a primary}} ingredient, and several types of lettuce can be used, such as butter lettuce, cos lettuce, Boston lettuce, romaine lettuce, green leaf lettuce and iceberg lettuce, among others. The lettuce may be chopped, torn, {{shredded}} or sliced into ribbons. Additional ingredients may include, {{but are not limited}} to, chicken stock, beef stock, cream, milk, wine, lemon juice, egg or egg yolk, meats, rice, potato, greens, sorrel, watercress, Swiss chard, escarole, peas, parsley/dried parsley, bread crumbs, onion, shallot, garlic, salt and pepper, among others. Some preparations purée all of the ingredients together, and some preparations are strained in a sieve. Lettuce soup is sometimes served with toast or rolls, either as a side dish or with the soup poured upon it. Sometimes croutons or chopped bacon are used in the dish or to garnish it. In French cuisine, lettuce soup is usually served poured atop thin slices of <b>lightly</b> <b>toasted</b> French bread. Some versions are served cold. Total calories can vary depending on ingredients used. For example, versions that use milk may have fewer calories than those that use cream.|$|E
40|$|Red {{wine from}} the Greek grape {{cultivar}} Aghiorghitiko, was aged in stainless steel {{with and without}} wood chips toasted to different degrees (heavily, medium, lightly) and in a 225 L American standard oak barrel for 32 days. Headspace concentrations of four wood-derived congeners (furfural, guaiacol, cis and trans oak lactones) were determined over this period after which the wines were bottled, stored and subjected to sensory descriptive analyses. Of the 36 attributes for appearance, aroma and oral characters, 14 were significant in univariate analyses and differentiated wines in a multivariate (principal component analysis) product space explaining 72 % variance in two factors. Wines from medium toast wood chips scored highest for woody, vegetative and smoky aromas and flavours but also for bitter taste and astringent mouthfeel and after 14 days had the highest headspace concentrations of furfural and cis oak lactone. Wood-related notes were ranked from heavily and <b>lightly</b> <b>toasted</b> chips, barrel and steel control...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} eff ect of ageing on the {{qualitative}} and quantitative composition of plum distillate in contact with oak wood chips. Maturation was performed with <b>lightly</b> <b>toasted</b> French oak (Quercus sessifl ora and Quercus robur) chips or oak chips made from fragments of empty barrels {{that had been used}} for ageing cognac. The eff ects of oak chip dose, process temperature, ageing system (static or circulatory) and ultrasound treatment were assessed. Maturation of plum distillate samples with oak chips resulted in higher levels of extractable organics (including tannins) and colour changes, which were correlated with the type and dose of oak chips, and the conditions of maturation. The content of sugars such as glucose, xylose and arabinose also increased, depending on the conditions and type of oak chips. Degradation of lignin resulted in liberation of sinapaldehyde, syringaldehyde, coniferaldehyde and vanillin, with intensities depending on the applied parameters. In terms of volatiles, decreases in the concentration of higher alcohols and aliphatic aldehydes were observed in the majority of maturation experiments, while concentrations of furanic aldehydes increased depending on the type and dose of oak chips, {{as well as on the}} conditions of maturation. The quantities of esters such as ethyl acetate decreased in the majority of experimental variants, whereas concentrations of ethyl caproate, ethyl caprylate and ethyl caprate increased gradually. Some phenols and lactones were detected in all matured samples, with the lowest levels found in the samples aged with oak chips made from cognac barrels...|$|E
