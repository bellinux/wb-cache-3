50|$|A {{phenomenon}} frequently {{observed during}} liquidity crises is flight to liquidity as investors exit illiquid investments {{and turn to}} secondary markets in pursuit of cash-like or easily saleable assets. Empirical evidence points towards widening price differentials, during periods of liquidity shortage, among assets that are otherwise alike, but differ {{in terms of their}} asset market liquidity. For instance, there are often large liquidity premia (in some cases as much as 10-15%) in Treasury bond prices. An example of a ﬂight to liquidity occurred during the 1998 Russian financial crisis, when the price of Treasury bonds sharply rose relative to less <b>liquid</b> <b>debt</b> instruments. This resulted in widening of credit spreads and major losses at Long-Term Capital Management and many other hedge funds.|$|E
40|$|After {{a series}} of crises, many {{developing}} countries came to recognize that reducing liquidity risk is an important self-protection. However, they have alternative strategies for the self-protection. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to show that macroeconomic impacts might be very different depending on which strategy developing countries will take. In the first part, we investigate what macroeconomic impacts an increased aversion to liquidity risk can have in a simple open economy model. When the government keeps foreign reserves constant, an increased aversion to liquidity risk reduces <b>liquid</b> <b>debt</b> and increases illiquid debt. However, its macroeconomic impacts are not large, causing only small current account surpluses. In contrast, when the government responds to the shock, the changed aversion increases foreign reserves and may lead to a rise of liquidity debt. In particular, under some reasonable parameter set, it causes large macroeconomic impacts, including significant current account surpluses. In the second part, we provide several empirical supports to the implications. In particular, we explore how foreign debt maturity structures changed in East Asia. We find that many East Asian economies reduced short-term borrowings temporarily after the crisis but increased short-term borrowings in the early 2000 s. Since short-term debt is <b>liquid</b> <b>debt,</b> the instantaneous change after the crisis is consistent with the case where only private agents responded to increased aversion to liquidity risk. However, accompanied by substantial rises in foreign exchange reserves, the change in the early 2000 s is consistent with the case where the government also started to respond. We discuss that our results have important implications for the recent deterioration in the U. S. current account. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the main drivers of leverage in leveraged buyouts, and provides {{an explanation for}} the significant decrease in leverage {{in the aftermath of the}} financial crisis.

In particular, we argue that <b>liquid</b> <b>debt</b> markets impact buyout leverage more than other macro-factors, such as future view on equity markets and interest rates. Private equity market activity being a driver implies that leverage increases when markets are characterised by fierce competition. Moreover, the results also suggest that leverage determinants changed as a consequence of the financial crisis. Leverage is in recent years highly related to debt market liquidity and equity markets, but independent of private equity market activity. We argue that this is a consequence of increased macro awareness and more conservative views on company outlooks...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the current {{stage of development}} of government securities markets in the non-GCC MENA region focusing in five countries that have government bond markets with a minimum size and greater potential for market development: Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia. The analysis focuses on the five key building blocks that normally sustain deep and <b>liquid</b> public <b>debt</b> markets: (i) money markets; (ii) primary market (issuance policy and placement mechanisms); (iii) secondary market organization; (iv) investor base; and (v) clearing and settlement infrastructure. The study shows that despite country differences, several common weaknesses in the key building blocks explain the underdevelopment of MENA bond markets. Most important among these are a symbiotic relationship between banks and Governments caused by lack of alternative investments that makes banks act as captive demand and dominate bond markets, opportunistic primary issuance practices, and excess liquidity in the financial system. These demand and supply characteristics have led to highly concentrated buy-and-hold portfolios by banks and State-owned institutions, poor price discovery and lack of liquidity in secondary markets. A set of actions to unlock market development in MENA is proposed involving measures in all key building blocks - from improvements in monetary policy implementation and liquidity management to enhancements in issuance practices, price transparency, and clearing&settlement infrastructure. Measures to improve the role of mutual funds and foster foreign investor presence are also of utmost importance to increase competition and investor diversification in these markets.
