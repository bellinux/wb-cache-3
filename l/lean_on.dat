25|$|When the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, {{and stay}} {{toward the front}} of the wave to become stable and prevent falling as the wave steepens. The {{acceleration}} is less toward the front than toward the back. The physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal acceleration force (Fsinθ) and the vertical force (Fcosθ=mg). Therefore, the surfer should lean forward to gain more speed, and <b>lean</b> <b>on</b> back foot to brake. Also, to increase the length of the ride of the wave, the surfer should travel parallel to the wave crest.|$|E
25|$|The librettos, {{that is the}} lyrics, for his vocal {{compositions}} {{played an}} important role for Bach: he sought collaboration with various text authors for his cantatas and major vocal compositions, eventually writing or adapting such texts himself to make them fit {{in the structure of the}} composition he was designing, when he could not <b>lean</b> <b>on</b> the talents of other text authors. His collaboration with Picander for the St Matthew Passion libretto is best known, but there was a similar process to come to a multi-layered structure for his St John Passion libretto a few years earlier.|$|E
25|$|On 23 September 1936 four naval {{personnel}} from {{the crew of}} cruiser Izumo went ashore and were taking a walk on Haining Road in the Shanghai International Settlement. At 8:20 PM when they approached the vicinity of its intersection with Wusong Road they were fired on from behind by four or five Chinese wielding pistols who were hiding in a stationary bus. The First-Class Seamen Tomomitsu Taminato and Yoshitane Yawata, as well as Second-Class Seaman Yoshimi Ideriha, sustained serious injuries. After that the three wounded men were brought into Shiseido Bookstore but Taminato, who had received piercing bullet wounds to his left arm and right breast, collapsed onto the floor when trying to <b>lean</b> <b>on</b> a bookshelf and died immediately.|$|E

25|$|A {{literary}} masterpiece {{from the}} 13th dynasty talking about Khufu {{is the famous}} Papyrus Westcar, where king Khufu witnesses a magical wonder and receives a prophecy from a magician named Dedi. Within the story, Khufu is characterised in a difficult-to-assess way. At one side he is depicted as ruthless when deciding to have a condemned prisoner decapitated to test the alleged magical powers of Dedi. At the other side Khufu is depicted as inquisitive, reasonable and generous: He accepts Dedi's outrage and his subsequent alternative offer for the prisoner, questions the circumstances and contents of Dedi's prophecy and rewards the magician generously after all. The contradictory depiction of Khufu {{is the object of}} great dispute between Egyptologists and historians to this day. Especially earlier Egyptologists and historians such as Adolf Erman, Kurt Heinrich Sethe and Wolfgang Helck evaluated Khufu's character as heartless and sacrilegious. They <b>lean</b> <b>on</b> the ancient Greek traditions of Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, who described an exaggerated negative character image of Khufu, ignoring the paradoxical (because positive) traditions the Egyptians themselves had always taught.|$|E
25|$|At {{the north}} end of the Chamber is the Speaker's Chair, a present to Parliament from the Commonwealth of Australia. The current British Speaker's Chair is an exact copy of the Speaker's Chair given to Australia, by the House of Commons, to {{celebrate}} the opening of Old Parliament House, Canberra. In front of the Speaker's Chair is the Table of the House, at which the clerks sit, and on which is placed the Commons' ceremonial mace. The Table was a gift from Canada. The dispatch boxes, which front-bench Members of Parliament (MPs) often <b>lean</b> <b>on</b> or rest notes on during Questions and speeches, are a gift from New Zealand. There are green benches on either side of the House; members of the Government party occupy benches on the Speaker's right, while those of the Opposition occupy benches on the Speaker's left. There are no cross-benches as in the House of Lords. The Chamber is relatively small, and can accommodate only 427 of the 650 Members of Parliament—during Prime Minister's Questions and in major debates MPs stand at either end of the House.|$|E
25|$|For documenta VI (1977), Serra {{designed}} Terminal, four 41-foot-tall trapezoids {{that form}} a tower, situated {{in front of}} the main exhibition venue. After long negotiations, accompanied by violent protests, Terminal was purchased by the city of Bochum and finally installed at the city's train station in 1979. Carnegie (1984–85), a 39-foot-high vertical shaft outside the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, received high praise. Similar sculptures, like Fulcrum (1987), Axis (1989), and Torque (1992), were later installed in London's Broadgate, at Kunsthalle Bielefeld, and at Saarland University, respectively. Initially located in the French town of Puteaux, Slat (1985) consists of five steel plates - four trapezoidal and one rectangular - each one roughly 12 feet wide and 40 feet tall, that <b>lean</b> <b>on</b> one another to form a tall, angular tepee. Already in 1989 vandalism and graffiti prompted that town’s mayor to remove it, and only in December 2008, after almost 20 years in storage, Slat was re-anchored in La Défense. Because of its weight, officials chose to ground it in a traffic island behind the Grande Arche.|$|E

500|$|The {{ice skating}} scenes were shot {{in an actual}} rink; Carell's talent at hockey was the reason the writers decided to set the episode there. Fischer had also learned to skate in {{preparation}} for the movie Blades of Glory, but the writers decided that {{there was no reason for}} Pam to be a good skater, so they had Pam <b>lean</b> <b>on</b> Jim.

500|$|As Mantis, {{the ride}} {{operated}} with two steel and fiberglass trains. Each train had eight cars with four seats {{in a single}} row supporting a total capacity of 32 riders. Mantis originally operated with three trains but the park later reduced operation to two trains due to the trains [...] "stacking" [...] on the brake run. Riders were secured by an over-the-shoulder harness. Although Mantis was a stand-up roller coaster, {{there was a small}} bicycle seat riders could <b>lean</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
500|$|Soon Sanders was {{attending}} all of MalcolmX's lectures at Temple Number Seven in Harlem. He always sought her out afterwards, {{and he would}} ask her a lot of questions. Sanders was impressed with MalcolmX's leadership and work ethic. She felt he was selfless {{when it came to}} helping others, but he had no one to <b>lean</b> <b>on</b> when he needed help. She thought maybe she could be that person. He also began to pressure her to join the Nation of Islam. In mid 1956, Sanders converted. Like many members of the Nation of Islam, she changed her surname to [...] "X", which represented the family name of her African ancestors that she could never know.|$|E

500|$|Blaine {{is portrayed}} by actor Darren Criss, who had auditioned for Glee several times for several roles before the {{character}} Blaine was created. He originally auditioned to play Finn Hudson. Criss made several audition videos for Glee, {{of which he}} posted only one to the social networking website MySpace where he sang a cover of Bill Withers' song <b>Lean</b> <b>on</b> Me. Although the series writers have seen them, he considers them supplemental to his main audition, which was for series creator Ryan Murphy. Murphy had not seen any of Criss's previous auditions, but knew he was the right actor for Blaine {{as soon as he}} saw this one. The actor cut his long hair before auditioning, to suit the [...] "serious and preppy" [...] role.|$|E
500|$|The {{ice skating}} scenes were shot {{in an actual}} rink. According to Jenna Fischer, Steve Carell used to play hockey, and the writers {{had been looking for}} a reason to use Carell's ice skating skills in an episode. Fischer had also learned to skate in {{preparation}} for the movie Blades of Glory, but the writers decided that {{there was no reason for}} Pam to be a good skater, so they had Pam <b>lean</b> <b>on</b> Jim. Saturday Night Live alumna Nancy Walls, who played Carol Stills, is actually Steve Carell's wife. At the rink, Michael tells Pam to be wary of breast cancer. This is the third joke that Stupnitsky and Eisenberg had aimed at Pam's breasts, after one each in [...] "The Fight" [...] and [...] "The Secret". Fischer later jokingly said that [...] "my breasts play a central role in one of tonight's scenes." [...] Fischer also noted that, due to the slight emphasis her breasts were receiving, many fans on the internet were arguing that Fischer had had breast implants. Fischer denied the rumors, but stated that she was [...] "flattered".|$|E
500|$|Lotus {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 56, based on 12 reviews. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe called it [...] "a good {{start in the}} effort to refocus attention on Aguilera's skills", but observed [...] "several tracks that sound mindlessly repetitive as sedentary listening experiences". Q called it [...] "generic" [...] and felt that [...] "nothing really stands out". Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club felt that the album [...] "often plays it safe" [...] and accused Aguilera of [...] "dumbing down her voice or lyrics for the sake of lightweight tunes or prevailing trends." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly found the album's [...] "self-empowerment anthems ... as contradictory as they are unoriginal" [...] and criticized its production for [...] "digitally smother" [...] Aguilera's vocals and [...] "draining all the emotion". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani asserted that because it is [...] "Aguilera's shortest album since her debut, it boasts less filler, but also fewer obvious standouts." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times felt that the album's conventional direction is [...] "its biggest crime, more than its musical unadventurousness or its emphasis on bland self-help lyrics or its reluctance to <b>lean</b> <b>on</b> [...] Aguilera's voice, the thing that makes her special". Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone dismissed it as a [...] "vitriol-tsunami of a record".|$|E
