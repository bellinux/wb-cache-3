40|$|Case StudyThe Waukesha Bearing Corporation in 1997 {{introduced}} a researche about thrust pad flutter and mention that: Tilting pad thrust bearings {{are commonly used}} on both the active <b>and</b> inactive (<b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloaded)</b> <b>sides</b> of thrust collars of turbo machinery rotors. Fatigue failure of temperature sensor lead wires to the inactive thrust pads are due to abnormal wear at the pad contact points. This case study will show how the repeated damage of RTD elements of hydrodynamic thrust bearings (JJ type) can occur in both the active and inactive side. We try to determine the main reason causing this failure, many trials had been done, {{and all of it}} failed. After deep analysis we discovered the main reason causing the failure, it was related to oil flow inside bearing housing. We try to avoid this by modifying the RTD element shape to override the repeated failure...|$|R
40|$|Two {{versions}} of the planetary reduction stages from U. S. Army OH- 58 helicopter main rotor transmissions were tested at NASA Lewis. One sequential and one nonsequential planetary were tested. Sun gear and ring gear teeth strains were measured, and stresses were calculated from the strains. The alternating stress at the fillet of both the <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloaded</b> <b>sides</b> of the teeth and {{at the root of}} the sun gear teeth are reported. Typical stress variations as the gear tooth moves through mesh are illustrated. At the tooth root location of the thin rimmed sun gear, a significant stress was produced by a phenomenon other than the passing of a planet gear. The load variation among the planets was studied. Each planet produced its own distinctive load distribution on the ring and sun gears. The load variation was less for a three planet, nonsequential design as compared to that of a four planet, sequential design. The reported results enhance the data base for gear stress levels and provide data for the validation of analytical methods...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{the name}} cog is {{recorded}} {{as early as}} the 9th century, the seagoing vessel of that name seems to have evolved on the Frisian coast during the 12th century. [...] Cogs progressively replaced Viking-type ships in Northern waters during the 13th century. Why this was the case is uncertain but cogs could carry more cargo than knarr of a similar size. Their flat bottoms allowed them to settle flat in harbour, making them easier to <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>unload.</b> Their high <b>sides</b> made them more difficult to board in a seafight, which may have made them safer from pirates.|$|R
50|$|In {{service with}} Lufthansa, the Ju 52 had {{proved to be}} an {{extremely}} reliable passenger airplane. Therefore, it was adopted by the Luftwaffe as a standard aircraft model. In 1938, the 7th Air Division had five air transport groups with 250 Ju 52s. The Luftwaffe had 552 Ju 52s at the start of World War II. Even though it was built in great numbers, the Ju 52 was technically obsolete. Between 1939 and 1944, 2,804 Ju 52s were delivered to the Luftwaffe (1939: 145; 1940: 388; 1941: 502; 1942: 503; 1943: 887; and 1944: 379). The production of Ju 52s continued until approximately the summer of 1944; when the war came to an end, there were still 100 to 200 available. The Ju 52 could carry 18 fully equipped soldiers, or 12 stretchers when used as an air ambulance. Transported material was <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloaded</b> through <b>side</b> doors by means of a ramp. Air dropped supplies were jettisoned through two double chutes; supply containers were dropped by parachute through the bomb-bay doors, and paratroopers jumped through the side doors. SdKfz 2 kettenkraftrad (half-track motorcycles) and supply canisters for parachute troops were secured under the fuselage at the bomb bay exits and were dropped with four parachutes. A tow coupling was built into the tail-skid for use in towing freight gliders. The Ju 52 could tow up to two DFS 230 gliders.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Polymeric {{composites}} exhibit highly nonlinear {{and rate}} dependent behavior during <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> in off-axis directions. In this study, off-axis specimens {{were used to}} study this behavior in AS 4 /PEEK thermoplastic composite. The equilibrium states of stress during <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> were determined by stress–relaxation and stress–recovery tests, respectively. It {{was found that the}} equilibrium stress–strain curves for <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> are basically the same for the same loading–unloading rate. A one-parameter plasticity model was used to generate a master equilibrium plastic stress–strain curve for both <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloading.</b> Stress relaxation curves and recovery curves were obtained during <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> cycles, respectively, for various strain rates. Similarity between relaxation and recovery curves was noted, and the effective stress defined from the one-parameter plastic potential function was able to describe both curves.

40|$|The use of {{non-slip}} surfaces during <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>unloading</b> of finishing pigs {{plays an}} important role in animal welfare and economics of the pork industry. Currently, the guidelines available only suggest the use of ramps with a slope below 20 degrees to <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>unload</b> pigs. However, the total time it takes to <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>unload</b> animals <b>and</b> slips, falls, and vocalizations are a welfare concern. Three ramp angles (0, 10 or 20 degrees), five bedding materials (nothing, sand, feed, wood shavings or wheat straw hay), two moistures (dry or wet bedding, > 50 % moisture) over two seasons (> 23. 9 °C summer, < 23. 9 °C winter) were assessed for slips/falls/vocalizations (n = 2400 pig observations) and analyzed with a scoring system. The use of bedding during summer or winter played a role in the total time it took to <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>unload</b> the ramp (p < 0. 05). Bedding, bedding moisture, season, and slope significantly interacted to impact the total time to <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>unload</b> finishing pigs (p < 0. 05).
