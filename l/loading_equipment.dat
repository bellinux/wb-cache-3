5|$|The docks {{occupy the}} former sound between Barry Island and the mainland. The {{contractors}} built dams to connect {{each end of}} the island to the mainland, drained or pumped the water from the site and excavated it. They used the material to level the area round the docks and for the core of breakwaters to protect the entrance. The works included a basin with gates at each end which served as a lock between the sea entrance and the docks, the dock walls and quays, coal <b>loading</b> <b>equipment</b> and railways to deliver coal from the mines to the docks. A second dock and second entrance lock were added in 1898. Barry Dock Offices were built in 1897-1900 by the architect Arthur E. Bell.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Hydraulic {{support is}} an {{important}} equipment of mechanization caving coal in modernization coal mine. Hydraulic support strength test is a key link in hydraulic support design. Based on the similarity theory, the displacement, stress and strain information of test measured from hydraulic support model test can be popularized to hydraulic support prototype. This has an important significance on successful pass in prototype hydraulic support strength test and quicker and better designing eligible hydraulic support. The construction of <b>load</b> <b>equipment</b> and hydraulic control system of hydraulic support model test provides a practical and convenient research way of hydraulic support model test. Preface By the <b>load</b> <b>equipment</b> and relevant hydraulic control system, user can realize the functions of adding pressure on hydraulic support sustaining post, vertical load, level load and turn a certain angle load of hydraulic support. The practical load bearing status of hydraulic support under well can also be simulated. At the same time, hydraulic support model strength test can be proceeded {{according to the national}} standard MT 312 - 2000 General Specification for Powered Support. The <b>Load</b> <b>Equipment</b> of Hydraulic Support Model Test The <b>load</b> <b>equipment</b> of hydraulic support model test was designed and made by inside and outside load pattern with artificial simulation the load status of hydraulic support under well. The <b>load</b> <b>equipment</b> and hydraulic control system are connected with high pressure entrance oil piles and return oil piles. The test board can realized the functions of vertical load, level and transverse level load, turn a certain angle from 0 degree to 45 degree and the combination of above functions, etc. The test board not only can accomplish the strength test for support model according to the national standard, but also proceed the strength test on hydraulic support mode...|$|R

25|$|Initially, the India-China airlift {{was flown}} with the Douglas DC-3 and its {{military}} versions, the C-47, C-53 and C-39. However, the DC-3 design's fuselage {{was so high}} off the ground that loading from most truck beds was difficult, and its narrow door and weak floor could not sustain heavy cargo. Although C-47s had reinforced flooring and a wider door, they still required specialized <b>loading</b> <b>equipment</b> {{for much of the}} cargo needed in China and had a limited payload capacity. Also, performance specifications of the Douglas transports were not suited to high-altitude operation with heavy payloads, and could not normally reach an altitude sufficient to clear the mountainous terrain, forcing the planes to attempt a highly dangerous route through the maze-like Himalayan passes.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} plans {{were made for}} the post-war {{completion}} of the ships, including modifying the turrets to load at a fixed angle of +4° to reduce the weight {{and complexity of the}} <b>loading</b> <b>equipment.</b> Another intended change was to lengthen the funnels by [...] to minimise smoke interference with the bridge, as this had been noted as a problem on the Gangut-class dreadnoughts. There were suggestions to improve the machinery with geared turbines, turbo-electric drive, or Föttinger's hydraulic transmission, but these were more theoretical than practical.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} changes was the decision to bore out the over-sized 40.6cm guns to 42cm caliber for the H-41 design. The design staff determined that modifications to the ammunition hoists and <b>loading</b> <b>equipment</b> would be easily effected and that the original turrets could be retained. The OKM was aware that the British had settled on a 40.6cm gun for the proposed the 42cm gun would grant the H-41 design a significant advantage over these new adversaries. The ships' armament was otherwise unchanged, apart from an increased number of 2cm anti-aircraft guns, of which there were now to be 34.|$|E

500|$|Once on site, {{they would}} be fired at ground level behind a hinged timber shutter, to provide some {{protection}} to the artillery crew. Timber wedges were used to control the barrel's elevation. The majority of medieval cannon were breechloaders, although {{there was still no}} effort to standardise calibres. The usual <b>loading</b> <b>equipment</b> consisted of a copper loading scoop, a ramrod, and a felt brush or [...] "sponge". A bucket of water was always kept beside the cannon. Skins or cloths soaked in cold water could be used to cool down the barrel, while acids could also be added to the water to clean out the inside of the barrel. Hot coals were used to heat the shot or keep the wire primer going.|$|E

An armored single mount, the Bettungsschiessgerüst (Firing platform) C/39 was used by these guns. It had a maximum elevation of 60° and could traverse up to 360°, depending on the emplacement. The C/39 mount had two compartments; the upper housed the guns and their <b>loading</b> <b>equipment,</b> while the lower contained the ammunition hoists, their motors, and the elevation and traverse motors. The mount was fully powered and had an underground magazine. Normally these were placed in open concrete barbettes, relying on their armor, but Hitler {{thought that there was}} not enough protection for the guns (Battery Todt) emplaced on Cap-Gris-Nez in the Pas de Calais near Wimereux and ordered a concrete casemate [...] thick built over and around the mounts. This had the unfortunate effect of limiting their traverse to 120°. Other C/39 mounts were installed at the Hanstholm fortress in Denmark, and the Vara fortress in Kristiansand, Norway.|$|E

All India Selection Tests are conducted among 15 Airmen Selection Centres (ASCs) located all over India. These centres are under the direct functional control of Central Airmen Selection Board (CASB), with administrative control and support by respective commands. The role of CASB is to carry out selection and enrolment of airmen from the Airmen Selection Centres for their respective commands. Candidates initially take a written test at the time of application. Those passing the written test undergo a physical fitness test, an interview conducted in English, and medical examination. Candidates for training are selected from individuals passing the battery of tests, on the basis of their performance. Upon completion of training, an individual becomes an Airman.
