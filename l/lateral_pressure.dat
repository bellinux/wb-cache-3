25|$|At rest lateral earth pressure, {{represented}} as K0, is the in situ <b>lateral</b> <b>pressure.</b> It {{can be measured}} directly by a dilatometer test (DMT) or a borehole pressuremeter test (PMT). As these are rather expensive tests, empirical relations have been created in order to predict at rest pressure with less involved soil testing, and relate to the angle of shearing resistance. Two of the more commonly used are presented below.|$|E

Cleaning or replacing the wood floor can make these used containers habitable, with proper attention to such essential issues as ventilation and insulation.|$|E

25|$|The correct {{method is}} to run the longe line through the inside bit ring, over the poll, and attach it to the outside bit ring. This method of {{attaching}} the line requires it to be changed each time the horse changes direction. This method has a slight gag effect, raising the bit up and applying pressure on {{the corners of the}} mouth and placing pressure on the poll, but puts less <b>lateral</b> <b>pressure</b> on the bit. It is best for horses that pull, or when the trainer is longeing a rider, to ensure maximum control of the horse.|$|E
25|$|The first locks {{built on}} the Toulouse plain by Pierre-Paul Riquet were {{experimental}} and were not satisfactory. They consisted of rectangular lock with wooden stilts as foundations for the side walls. This form did not properly restrain the lateral material when the lock was empty. They then collapsed on themselves. He redefined {{the shape of his}} locks to rounded side walls, thicker, and more resistant to the <b>lateral</b> <b>pressure</b> of the earth. The dimensions of the locks were then large enough for the time. Because of these rounded forms, the architecture of the locks in the Canal du Midi is called Baroque style.|$|E
25|$|Slope {{stability}} {{is the potential}} of soil covered slopes to withstand and undergo movement. Stability {{is determined by the}} balance of shear stress and shear strength. A previously stable slope may be initially affected by preparatory factors, making the slope conditionally unstable. Triggering factors of a slope failure can be climatic events which can then make a slope unstable, leading to mass movements. Mass movements can be caused by increase in shear stress, such as loading, <b>lateral</b> <b>pressure,</b> and transient forces. Alternatively, shear strength may be decreased by weathering, changes in pore water pressure, and organic material.|$|E

2500|$|The {{active state}} {{occurs when a}} {{retained}} soil mass is allowed to relax or deform laterally and outward (away from the soil mass) {{to the point of}} mobilizing its available full shear resistance (or engaged its shear strength) in trying to resist lateral deformation. That is, the soil is at the point of incipient failure by shearing due to unloading in the lateral direction. It is the minimum theoretical <b>lateral</b> <b>pressure</b> that a given [...] soil mass will exert on a retaining that will move or rotate away from the soil until the soil active state is reached (not necessarily the actual in-service <b>lateral</b> <b>pressure</b> on walls that do not move when subjected to soil lateral pressures higher than the active pressure). The passive state occurs when a soil mass is externally forced laterally and inward (towards the soil mass) to the point of mobilizing its available full shear resistance in trying to resist further lateral deformation. That is, the soil mass is at the point of incipient failure by shearing due to loading in the lateral direction. It is the maximum lateral resistance that a given soil mass can offer to a retaining wall that is being pushed towards the soil mass. That is, the soil is at the point of incipient failure by shearing, but this time due to loading in the lateral direction. Thus active pressure and passive resistance define the minimum <b>lateral</b> <b>pressure</b> and the maximum lateral resistance possible from a given mass of soil.|$|E

2500|$|Ellen G. White's visions {{prompted}} {{several books}} {{by one of}} her followers, George McCready Price, leading to the 20th-century revival of flood geology. After years selling White's books door-to-door, Price took a one-year teacher-training course and taught in several schools. When shown books on evolution and the fossil sequence which contradicted his beliefs, he found the answer in White's [...] "revealing word pictures" [...] which suggested how the fossils had been buried. He studied textbooks on geology and [...] "almost tons of geological documents", finding [...] "how the actual facts of the rocks and fossils, stripped of mere theories, splendidly refute this evolutionary theory of the invariable order of the fossils, which is the very backbone of the evolution doctrine." [...] In 1902 he produced a manuscript for a book proposing geology based on Genesis, in which the sequence of fossils resulted from the different responses of animals to the encroaching flood. He agreed with White {{on the origins of}} coal and oil, and conjectured that mountain ranges (including the Alps and Himalaya) formed from layers deposited by the flood which had then been [...] "folded and elevated to their present height by the great <b>lateral</b> <b>pressure</b> that accompanied its subsidence". He then found a report describing paraconformities and a paper on thrust faults. He concluded from these [...] "providential discoveries" [...] {{that it was impossible to}} prove the age or overall sequence of fossils, and included these points in his self-published paperback of 1906, Illogical Geology: The Weakest Point in the Evolution Theory. His arguments continued this focus on disproving the sequence of strata, and he ultimately sold more than 15,000 copies of his 1923 college textbook The New Geology.|$|E

Few readers will need now to be reminded, that every arch or gable not tied at its base by beams or bars, exercises a <b>lateral</b> <b>pressure</b> upon the walls which sustain it,--pressure which may, indeed, be met and sustained by increasing the thickness of the wall or vertical piers, and which is in reality thus met in most Italian buildings, but may, with less expenditure of material, and with (perhaps) more graceful effect, be met by some particular application of the provisions against <b>lateral</b> <b>pressure</b> called Buttresses.

Thus, Prof. Dana imputes the glacial epoch chiefly, if not wholly, to elevation of the land caused by the <b>lateral</b> <b>pressure</b> due to shrinking of the earth's crust that has caused all other elevations and depressions. He says: [...] "Now, that elevation of the land over the higher latitudes which brought on the glacial era is a natural result of the same agency, and a natural, and almost necessary, counterpart of the coral-island subsidence which must have been then in progress. The accumulating, folding, solidification, and crystallisation of rocks attending all the rock-making and mountain-making through the Palæozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras, had greatly stiffened the crust in these parts; and hence in after times, the continental movements resulting from the <b>lateral</b> <b>pressure</b> necessarily appeared over the more northern portions of the continent, where the accumulations and other changes had been relatively small. To the subsidence which followed the elevation {{the weight of the}} ice-cap may have contributed in some small degree. But the great balancing movements of the crust of the continental and oceanic areas then going forward must have had a greatly preponderating effect in the oscillating agency of all time--lateral pressure within the crust."

6000|$|... 293. II. Formation.--Mountains {{are to be}} arranged, {{with respect}} to their structure, under two great classes--those which are cut out of the beds of which they are composed, and those which are formed by the {{convolution}} or contortion of the beds themselves. The Savoy mountains are chiefly of this latter class. When stratified formations are contorted, it is usually either by pressure from below, which raises one part of the formation above the rest, or by <b>lateral</b> <b>pressure,</b> which reduces the whole formation into a series of waves. The ascending pressure may be limited in its sphere of operation; the lateral one necessarily affects extensive tracts of country, and the eminences it produces vanish only by degrees, like the waves left {{in the wake of a}} ship. The Savoy mountains have undergone both these kinds of violence in very complex modes and at different periods, so that it becomes almost impossible to trace separately and completely the operation of any given force at a given point.|$|E
60|$|Geology {{has applied}} a similar {{conception}} to {{the origin and}} becoming of the earth's material and external features {{as we now know}} them. Accepting from astronomy the notion of our planet's primary condition as a cooling sphere of incandescent matter, it goes on to show how the two great envelopes, atmospheric and oceanic, gaseous and liquid, have gradually formed around its solid core; how the hard crust of the central mass has been wrinkled and corrugated into mountain chain and deep-cut valley, uplifted here into elevated table-land or there depressed into hollow ocean bed; how sediment has slowly gathered {{on the floor of the}} sea, and how volcanic energies or <b>lateral</b> <b>pressure</b> have subsequently forced up the resulting deposits into Alpine peaks and massive continents. In this direction, it was Lyell who principally introduced into science the uniformitarian or evolutionary principle, who substituted for the frequent cataclysms and fresh beginnings of the earlier geologists the grand conception of continuous action, producing from comparatively infinitesimal but cumulative causes effects which at last attain by accretion the most colossal proportions.|$|E

My attention was originally called to the new archipelago by a brother investigator of my own aerial race, who pointed out to me on the wing that at a spot some 900 miles {{to the west of the}} Portuguese coast, just opposite the place where your mushroom city of Lisbon now stands, the water of the ocean, as seen in a bird's-eye view from some three thousand feet above, formed a distinct greenish patch such as always betokens shoals or rising ground at the bottom. Flying out at once to the point he indicated, and poising myself above it on my broad pinions at a giddy altitude, I saw at a glance that my friend was quite right. Land making was in progress.

Slowly the winter descended, snow after snow, keeping a line beautifully straight along the mountain-sides, till it reached the valley and put out our garden roses at last. The hard-wood trees lost their leaves, and stretched dim and brown along the lower ranges; the pines straggled high up into the snows. The Jura, far across the lake; was vaguely roseate, with an effect of perpetual sunset; the Dent-du-Midi lost the distinction of its eternal drifts; and the cold not only descended upon us, but from the frozen hills all round us hemmed us in with a <b>lateral</b> <b>pressure</b> that pierced and chilled to the marrow.
