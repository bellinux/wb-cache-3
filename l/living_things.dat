5|$|<b>Living</b> <b>things</b> like orchids, hummingbirds, and the peacock's tail have {{abstract}} designs with {{a beauty}} of form, pattern and colour that artists struggle to match. The beauty that people perceive in nature has causes at different levels, {{notably in the}} mathematics that governs what patterns can physically form, and among <b>living</b> <b>things</b> in the effects of natural selection, that govern how patterns evolve.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{experimental}} evidence against spontaneous generation came in 1668 when Francesco Redi showed that no maggots appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs. It was gradually shown that, {{at least in}} the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms, the previous sentiment regarding spontaneous generation was false. The alternative seemed to be biogenesis: that every <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> came from a pre-existing <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> (omne vivum ex ovo, Latin for [...] "every <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> from an egg").|$|R
5000|$|The {{movement}} of involution {{is defined by}} a <b>living</b> <b>thing's</b> tendency to preserve itself. The <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> perdures by organizing itself. On the one hand, {{it is capable of}} withdrawing into itself {{and on the other hand}} to persevere in its distinction with respect to that which is not itself.|$|R

2500|$|Jamīl Shāmi {{asserts that}} there is a type of al- that connotes the essence of something. For example, [...] "And we made from water every <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> ..." [...] (Qur'an 21:30) can be {{translated}} as [...] "And we made from the essence of water (i.e., from the compound H2O) every <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> ..." ...|$|R
5000|$|We (God) created every <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> {{out of the}} water. Qur'an 21:30 ...|$|R

5|$|<b>Living</b> <b>things</b> further play a {{wide variety}} of {{symbolic}} roles in literature, film, mythology, and religion.|$|E
5|$|Mathematics, {{physics and}} {{chemistry}} can explain patterns in nature at different levels. Patterns in <b>living</b> <b>things</b> are explained by the biological processes of natural selection and sexual selection. Studies of pattern formation make use of computer models to simulate {{a wide range of}} patterns.|$|E

500|$|Because of the {{difference}} of mass, the activity of life inside in a <b>living</b> <b>thing's</b> atoms would undergo many millennia before enough time passes for that <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> to take a single step. [...] Raëlians believe the universe is infinite {{in time and space}} and lacks a center. Because of this, one could not imagine where an ethereal soul would go.|$|R
5|$|All <b>living</b> <b>things</b> on Earth (including methanogens) use {{liquid water}} as a solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane. Water is a {{stronger}} solvent than methane. Water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E
5|$|Animals as a {{category}} have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other <b>living</b> <b>things.</b> Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists. They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.|$|E
5|$|Archaea are prokaryotic {{unicellular}} organisms, {{and form}} the first domain of life, in Carl Woese's three-domain system. A prokaryote {{is defined as}} having no cell nucleus or other membrane bound-organelle. Archaea share this defining feature with the bacteria {{with which they were}} once grouped. In 1990 the microbiologist Woese proposed the three-domain system that divided <b>living</b> <b>things</b> into bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, and thereby split the prokaryote domain.|$|E
5000|$|Our Hansen Sea-Cow was {{not only}} a <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> but a mean, irritable, contemptible, vengeful, mischievous, hateful <b>living</b> <b>thing....</b> it loved to ride {{on the back of a}} boat, {{trailing}} its propeller daintily in the water while we rowed... when attacked with a screwdriver it fell apart in simulated death... It loved no one, trusted no one, it had no friends.|$|R

5|$|Historically, all <b>living</b> <b>things</b> were {{classified}} as either animals or plants and botany covered the study of all organisms not considered animals. Botanists examine both the internal functions and processes within plant organelles, cells, tissues, whole plants, plant populations and plant communities. At each of these levels, a botanist may be concerned with the classification (taxonomy), phylogeny and evolution, structure (anatomy and morphology), or function (physiology) of plant life.|$|E
5|$|In biology, natural {{selection}} {{can cause the}} development of patterns in <b>living</b> <b>things</b> for several reasons, including camouflage, sexual selection, and different kinds of signalling, including mimicry and cleaning symbiosis. In plants, the shapes, colours, and patterns of insect-pollinated flowers like the lily have evolved to attract insects such as bees. Radial patterns of colours and stripes, some visible only in ultraviolet light serve as nectar guides {{that can be seen}} at a distance.|$|E
5|$|Lamarck {{proposed}} the transmutation of species ("transformisme"), {{but did not}} believe that all <b>living</b> <b>things</b> shared a common ancestor. Rather he believed that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force, which he sometimes described as a nervous fluid, drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity similar to the mediaeval great chain of being.|$|E

40|$|Egoism is {{the view}} that self-interest is the {{exclusive}} standard of morally right action. In this dissertation, I present two arguments for egoism: a naturalistic argument and an intuitive argument. The naturalistic argument grounds egoism in a theory of what {{the end of every}} <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> is: The end of a <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> is, I will argue, only to survive. I set the stage for and develop this argument across the first four Chapters. In Chapter 1, I present the case for the prevailing, neo-Aristotelian view of the end of a living thing: The end of a <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> is to instantiate its species. The pursuit of this end is typically understood to involve not only survival, but also flourishing, reproducing, and helping other members of one’s species, all in species-characteristic ways. In Chapter 2, I argue that the aforementioned species view is false. In Chapter 3, I develop the view that the end of every <b>living</b> <b>thing,</b> including every human <b>living</b> <b>thing,</b> is only to survive. In Chapter 4, I argue that human well-being (or self-interest), the notion of what intrinsically benefits a human being, consists in and only in survival. In the fifth and final Chapter, I develop the intuitive argument, which adopts the method of reflective equilibrium. I argue that egoism aligns well with a critical mass of our intuitions about the moral life...|$|R
5|$|Most <b>living</b> <b>things</b> {{that are}} {{visible to the}} naked eye in their adult form are eukaryotes, {{including}} humans. However, a large number of eukaryotes are also microorganisms. Unlike bacteria and archaea, eukaryotes contain organelles such as the cell nucleus, the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria in their cells. The nucleus is an organelle that houses the DNA that makes up a cell's genome. DNA (Deoxyribonuclaic acid) itself is arranged in complex chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the 19th century, the scope of {{physiology}} expanded greatly, from a primarily medically oriented field to a wide-ranging investigation of the physical and chemical processes of life—including plants, animals, and even microorganisms in addition to man. <b>Living</b> <b>things</b> as machines became a dominant metaphor in biological (and social) thinking.|$|E
5|$|Sacred groves {{exist in}} China, India, Africa and elsewhere. They {{are places where}} the deities live and where all the <b>living</b> <b>things</b> are either sacred or are companions of the gods. Folklore lays down the supernatural {{penalties}} that will result if desecration takes place for example by the felling of trees. Because of their protected status, sacred groves {{may be the only}} relicts of ancient forest and have a biodiversity much greater than the surrounding area.|$|E

50|$|Because {{life is to}} be {{considered}} sacred and in every <b>living</b> <b>thing,</b> Jains avoid killing any living creature. They are not only vegetarian, but decline to eat vegetables that grow under the ground, for fear of injuring a <b>living</b> <b>thing</b> when disturbing the ground during harvest. Often Jain monks will sweep {{the ground in front}} of them as they walk so as not to step on an unseen creature.|$|R
