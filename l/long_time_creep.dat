40|$|The time-temperature-stress {{equivalent}} (TTSE) principle {{refers to}} the phenomenon that the time-dependent mechanical properties of materials rely on the variations of temperature and stress level. Thus, {{it is reasonable to}} predict the long time material mechanical properties based on their relationships with rising temperatures and stress levels. According to the single-integral nonlinear constitutive equation proposed by Schapery, a general expression of the TTSE principle for nonlinear viscoelastic creep property is deduced. The specific expression for time-temperature-stress shift factor is presented by assuming quadratic polynomial form of the Doolittle formula for the viscosity as a function of free volume. Creep curves of granite at different temperatures and stress levels are introduced, and the validation of applying time-temperature-stress principle to predict the <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>creep</b> property of granite is provided. The master curves are generated through vertical shift modification and horizontal shift equivalence of all creep curves, and corresponding coefficients in the shift equations are determined by curve fittings. The results indicate the modified time-temperature-stress equivalent relation is appropriate to predict the <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>creep</b> property of granite. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 This thesis {{presents}} the creep properties and {{the relations between}} stress and strain of "Expanded 460 KV", "Chukar" and "Drake" conductors. The basic theories {{of the effect of}} load, material, and temperature on the conductor are also briefly discussed. The <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>creep</b> curve of a conductor appears as a straight line in log-log plot. The stable period of this curve after prestressing is directly affected by the prestress load and time. The conductor's initial strain is increased if the conductor is reeled or severely bent. The slope of the stress-strain curve of a conductor is only slightly affected by the <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>creep.</b> It is also slightly influenced by the initial condition of the conductor. However, the complete stress strain curve will move to the right of where it should be if the conductor is severely reeled or bent. Repeated temporary load (wind and ice) will increase the non-elastic elongation of a conductor. The configuration of stress-strain curve of a conductor is different from that of a homogeneous metal. A hysteresis loop always exists between stress-strain curve of loading and the curve of unloading...|$|E

Finite element method is used to quantitatively assess the effect of large deformation. The results show that the predicted creep curves of all the three specimens are significantly affected by the large deformation.

Laboratory creep test results are reported for Pheasant, Narcissus and Chukar conductors. The report follows a standard nomenclature and format suggested by the International Study Committee No. 6 of Conference Internationale des Grands Reseaux Electriques (C. I. G. R. E.). A theoretical introduction to conductor creep describes mechanical and metallurgical factors. The mechanical factors of conductor stranding are less well understood and less predictable than metallurgical factors.

An initial stress-strain loading produces more uniform subsequent creep behavior than does prestressing at normal times and tension levels. 2. The creep factor F is related inversely to the slope n for all conductor types, manufacturing practices and prestressing techniques for conductors that have been studied in the laboratory. 3.

40|$|In this dissertation, we {{characterize}} the polymeric and rheological properties of polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) present within the matrix of extracellular polymers (EPS) in biofilms formed by Staphylococcus epidermidis. Biofilms are viscoelastic soft matter consisting of bacterial aggregates embedded within the EPS. The EPS predominantly contains polysaccharides, {{in addition to}} proteins and DNA. S. epidermidis biofilms frequently contaminate medical implants resulting in blood stream infections. In such cases, biofilm formation by S. epidermidis and resistance to blood shear stresses is attributed {{to the presence of}} PIA. Using techniques of chromatography, light scattering, microrheology and colloidal physics, we understand the contribution of PIA towards biofilm viscoelasticity. We identified that PIA exhibits self-associations and complexation with proteins in dilute solutions. At concentrations found within shaker grown biofilms, PIA displayed a viscoelastic rheology. We extracted concentration dependent scaling laws for zero-shear viscosity and the creep compliance of PIA. A polymeric composite consisting of PIA, bovine serum albumin and lambda DNA, simulating the biofilm EPS, was 50 -fold more elastic than PIA. However, we found that the EPS polymers, on their own, do not generate the elasticity of mature biofilms. To understand this gap, we report the self-assembly of artificial biofilms using planktonic cells and the polysaccharide chitosan as a proxy for PIA. We report that the elasticity or the <b>long</b> <b>time</b> plateau in <b>creep</b> compliance, in the artificial biofilms is mediated by pH induced phase instability of chitosan. Using this finding, we showed that increasing the pH of the solvent environment resulted in softening of a S. epidermidis biofilm within 4 hours. To support development of medical procedures aimed at biofilm softening, we provide a theoretical derivation to extend the applicability of cavitation rheometry, to measure elastic modulus of materials as small as few microliters, similar to biofilms formed in infection sites. Collectively, the study provides structural and rheological characterization of biofilm exopolymers that supports multi-component constitutive modeling of biofilms and development of treatment techniques that target biofilm disassembly through physicochemical changes to the growth environment...|$|R
