Methods Sixty premature infants enrolled {{in this study and}} ran- domly assigned to have FHM and HM delivered by infusofeedpump, in parallel, non-blinded controlled trial. All patients were followed until day 30 or until discharge, whichever came first. The weight gain was recorded daily, while length and head circumference in- crement were recorded weekly. Results The FHM group gained more weight than the HM group (335. 0 + 55. 5 g vs. 290. 6 + 108. 4 g, p= 0. 000, 95 %CI - 170. 2;- 81. 2), larger length increment (1. 9 + 1. 1 cm vs. 1. 2 + 0. 4 cm, p= 0. 000, 95 %CI - 1. 37;- 0. 55), and larger head increment (1. 87 + 1. 1 cm vs. 0. 91 + 0. 43 cm, 95 %CI - 1. 37;- 0. 55).

40|$|Inspired by {{the ongoing}} process of {{decentralization}} {{and in an}} effort to inform local and national policy makers concerned with food security, this paper provides a descriptive but detailed geographical overview of Congo’s food markets as well as the nutritional status of its population. To do so, this paper will mainly rely on the 1 - 2 - 3 budget survey data, conducted in 2004 – 2005. Along both dimensions, access to food and nutrition, a good deal of spatial variation exists. First, overall efficiency of domestic food markets seems extremely poor. The capital city of Kinshasa {{is a good example of}} this; it is food deficient and poorly connected to its own hinterland and therefore highly dependent on foreign food imports. Markets in the former provinces of Kasaï, in the center of the country, and the conflict-prone northeastern part of the country are two minor exceptions, as food prices are slightly more equal. Furthermore, the most competitive food producers are found in Équateur and North Kivu. Notwithstanding these differences in food access, about five diet types can be identified. The most energy-rich diet is based on cassava and palm oil, typically consumed in Maniema, Orientale, Équateur, and rural Bas-Congo. As a result, these provinces on average display higher calorie intakes. Apart from diet composition, income levels and prevailing nonfood needs also determine energy sufficiency. For these reasons households in Katanga and North Kivu are relatively well nourished too, while urban dwellers in Bas-Congo and Orientale (contrary to their corresponding rural sector), and especially households in South Kivu and Kinshasa, suffer from <b>large</b> <b>calorie</b> deficiencies.

50|$|A common {{argument}} in favor of high-carbohydrate diets is that most carbohydrates break down readily into glucose in the bloodstream, and therefore the body does not have to work as hard to get its energy in a high-carbohydrate diet as a low-carbohydrate diet. This argument, by itself, is incomplete. Although many dietary carbohydrates do break down into glucose, most of that glucose does not remain in the bloodstream for long. Its presence stimulates the beta cells in the pancreas to release insulin, which has the effect of causing about two-thirds of body cells to take in glucose, and causing fat cells to take in fatty acids and store them. As the blood-glucose level falls, the amount of insulin released is reduced; the entire process is completed in non-diabetics in an hour or two after eating. High-carbohydrate diets require more insulin production and release than low-carbohydrate diets, and some evidence indicates the increasingly <b>large</b> percentage of <b>calories</b> consumed as refined carbohydrates is positively correlated with the increased incidence of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes.|$|R
30|$|The optimal {{caloric intake}} in {{critically}} ill patients {{is a matter}} of intense debate [1 – 6]. Indeed, several retrospective studies reported a positive correlation between the magnitude of the caloric debt and the rate of complications [7 – 9], while others reported that the provision of 25 – 66  % of the recommended caloric intake was associated with the best outcome [10, 11]. Similarly, some interventional trials reported a worse outcome for the patients receiving the <b>larger</b> dose of <b>calories</b> (i.e. 25 – 30) than the smaller dose (10 – 15  kcal/kg/day) during the first days of the stay {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) [12, 13], while others were unable to find a clinically relevant difference between patients randomised to a high-caloric versus low-caloric nutrition therapy [1, 14 – 17], even though statistically significant differences in secondary and tertiary outcome variables were found for one study [15]. The uncertainty regarding the optimal caloric intake is reflected by important divergences between guidelines, especially regarding the timing of adding supplemental parenteral nutrition when enteral intake is deemed insufficient during the first seven days of the ICU stay [18, 19].|$|R
40|$|Endemic to {{the islands}} of Sumatra and Borneo, the {{orangutan}} (genus Pongo) is endangered and approaching extinction in the wild. Pongo requires a <b>large</b> amount of <b>calories</b> and travels across extensive tracts of forest in search of food.

This is of particular concern because traditionally Pongo has been understood to live a solitary existence. However, research from {{the last few decades}} reveals the orangutan social system to be far more multifaceted than previously assumed; orangutans have established relationships and interact with conspecifics frequently. The socio-ecological model explains that female and male population distribution reflects food availability and distribution. Additional evidence suggests that when provided with food, and thus relieved of the pressure to procure food, orangutans exhibit behavioral flexibility and are able to live in close proximity to conspecifics without increased aggression. I propose Pongo is a behaviorally flexible primate capable, if provisioned, of living in “mono-social” groups as a radical response to extensive habitat and population loss...|$|R

40|$|Beans {{are grown}} by nearly all rural {{households}} in Rwanda, provide a <b>large</b> share of <b>calorie</b> intakes, {{and are a}} vital source of proteins and micronutrients. Because {{of the importance of}} this crop, significant research efforts have been devoted to select, breed, and disseminate bean varieties with superior production, consumption, and market attributes, while addressing challenges related to climate changes and food insecurity. As a result, nearly 100 bean varieties have been released in Rwanda over the last four decades. This study aims at documenting this effort; it assesses adoption of improved bush and climbing bean varieties, identifies determinants of and barriers to adoption, and analyzes farmers' preferred variety attributes. Based on recent household data, 86 and 50 percent of households have adopted improved climbing and bush bean varieties, respectively. Adoption is positively associated with membership in farmers associations and size of landholding devoted to bean cultivation. Agro-climatic factors are strong predictors of adoption in general and of specific popular improved varieties. Varietal attributes most associated with high adoption rates are high yield, early maturity, storability, and taste. Findings from this study can serve to inform future breeding and dissemination efforts of improved bean varieties in Rwanda.

We therefore review the state of knowledge on the current use of biotechnology applied to cassava cultivars and its implications for breeding the crop into the future. The history of the development of the first transgenic cassava plant serves as the basis to explore molecular aspects of somatic embryogenesis and friable embryogenic callus production. We analyze complex plant-pathogen interactions to profit from such knowledge to help cassava fight bacterial diseases and look at candidate genes possibly involved in resistance to viruses and whiteflies—the two most important traits of cassava. The review also covers the analyses of main achievements in transgenic-mediated nutritional improvement and mass production of healthy plants by tissue culture and synthetic seeds. Finally, the perspectives of using genome editing and the challenges associated to climate change for further improving the crop are discussed.
