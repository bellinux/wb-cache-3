40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the nutritive value of two varieties of <b>lentils</b> (Lens culinaris), namely green and red varieties. For this purpose the chemical components: crude protein, starch, ash, sugars (monosaccharides and oligosaccharides), crude fat, total fibers and dry matter of two <b>lentils</b> varieties (green and red) were determined by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy technology (NIRS).

40|$|Abstract: Powder {{derived from}} <b>Lentils</b> was hydrolyzed {{sequentially}} using five different enzymes and their combinations for production of antioxidant peptide.

5|$|The {{parathyroid}} glands are {{two pairs}} of glands usually positioned behind {{the left and right}} lobes of the thyroid. Each gland is a yellowish-brown flat ovoid that resembles a <b>lentil</b> seed, usually about 6mm long and 3 to 4mm wide, and 1 to 2mm anteroposteriorly. There are typically four parathyroid glands. The two parathyroid glands on each side which are positioned higher are called the superior parathyroid glands, while the lower two are called the inferior parathyroid glands. Healthy parathyroid glands generally weigh about 30mg in men and 35mg in women. These glands are not visible or able to be felt during examination of the neck.|$|E
5|$|Indefatigable was {{assigned}} to the BPF in November and she arrived in Colombo, Ceylon on 10 December where she joined the 1st ACS. Together with the other carriers of the BPF, she attacked oil refineries in Sumatra in January 1945 (Operation <b>Lentil</b> and Operation Meridian) before sailing to Sydney to prepare for operations in the Pacific. The BPF joined the American Fifth Fleet at Ulithi on 20 March and attacked airfields on the Sakishima Islands, south of Okinawa, beginning on 26 March, as part of the preparations for Operation Iceberg. During these operations, Indefatigable became the first British carrier to be hit by a kamikaze when one penetrated the combat air patrol (CAP) and struck the base of her island on 1 April. The bomb carried by the kamikaze did not detonate and this limited casualties to 21 men killed and 27 wounded. Damage to the ship was minimal and the flight deck was back in operation thirty minutes later. After Okinawa had been secured, the BPF arrived back at Sydney on 7 June and Indefatigable was delayed rejoining operations as she required repairs to her machinery. She departed Manus on 12 July and reached the coast of Japan eight days later. Her aircraft began attacking targets in the Inland Sea on 24 July. Most of the BPF withdrew as planned on 10 August to prepare for Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu scheduled for November, but Indefatigable and several other ships remained to represent Britain at the end of operations. The ship's aircraft flew missions on 13 and 15 August; during the last of these missions, her Seafires shot down eight of twelve Mitsubishi A6M Zeros while losing one of their own and an Avenger gunner shot down another Japanese aircraft. After the ceasefire, her aircraft continued to fly CAP and flew reconnaissance missions looking for Allied prisoners of war.|$|E

50|$|According to the USDA National Nutrient Database, 100 g of raw <b>lentils</b> (variety unspecified) provide 353 calories; {{the same}} weight of cooked <b>lentils</b> {{provides}} 116 calories. Raw <b>lentils</b> are 8% water, 63% carbohydrates including 11% dietary fiber, 25% protein and 1% fat (table). <b>Lentils</b> are a rich source (20% {{or more of the}} Daily Value, DV) of numerous essential nutrients, including folate (120% DV), thiamin (76% DV), pantothenic acid (43% DV), vitamin B6 (42% DV), phosphorus (40% DV), iron (50% DV) and zinc (35%), among others (table). When <b>lentils</b> are cooked by boiling, protein content declines to 9% of total composition, and B vitamins and minerals decrease due to the overall water content increasing (protein itself isn't lost).|$|R

40|$|<b>Lentils</b> (Lens esculenta Moench, cv. Tekoas) {{grown in}} a {{nutrient}} solution containing 15 millimolar nitrate had 84 % fewer nodules than <b>lentils</b> grown in nitrate-free nutrient solution. Nodules from the nitrate-grown plants weighed 71 % less than nodules from the nitrate-free plants. Nitrate-grown plants also fixed much less nitrogen (measured by acetylene reduction) than the nitrate-free plants. When <b>lentils</b> were grown {{in a solution}} containing 15 millimolar nitrate and 75 millimolar fructose, glucose, or sucrose, however, the nitrogen fixation activity of their nodules {{was similar to that}} of nodules from nitrate-free plants. Leaves of <b>lentils</b> grown in the nitrate-sugar solutions had only about 7 % as much nitrate reductase activity and accumulated only 10 % as much nitrate as leaves from <b>lentils</b> grown in the nitrate solution alone. Roots of <b>lentils</b> grown in the nitrate-sugar solutions had similar nitrate reductase activity but accumulated only 17 to 25 % as much nitrate as roots from <b>lentils</b> grown in the nitrate solution. The results indicate that the added sugars alleviated the inhibitory effects of nitrate on symbiotic nitrogen fixation not only by increasing the carbohydrate supply so <b>lentils</b> could support both nitrogen fixation and nitrate reduction but also by inhibiting the accumulation of nitrate and, hence, lowering nitrate reductase activity in the leaves...|$|R
