5|$|One complication—unintentional and unrecognized {{intubation}} of the esophagus—is both common (as frequent as 25% in {{the hands}} of inexperienced personnel) and <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> in a deleterious or even fatal outcome. In such cases, oxygen is inadvertently administered to the stomach, from where it cannot be taken up by the circulatory system, instead of the lungs. If this situation is not immediately identified and corrected, death will ensue from cerebral and cardiac anoxia.|$|E
5|$|A {{state may}} place {{the burden on}} the {{defendant}} has to prove incompetence by the preponderance of the evidence, but the state cannot require the defendant to prove incompetence by a higher standard, such as clear and convincing evidence. The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary. The state may involuntarily medicate the defendant in order to make her competent for trial, but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> in competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore competence.|$|E

5|$|Well over 200 virus strains are {{implicated in}} the cause of the common cold; the rhinoviruses are the most common. They spread through the air during close contact with {{infected}} people and indirectly through contact with objects in the environment followed by transfer to the mouth or nose. Risk factors include going to daycare, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. Symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. People with influenza often show similar symptoms as people with a cold, though symptoms are usually more severe in the former. Influenza is less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> in a runny nose.|$|E
5|$|DDT was {{a widely}} used {{pesticide}} in agriculture {{that was found}} to have significant adverse effects on wildlife, particularly egg thinning and subsequent breakage in birds of prey. A review of DDT's impact on Australian raptors between 1947 and 1993 found that the average egg-shell thickness had decreased by 6%. This average level of thinning was not thought <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> in significantly more breakage overall, however individual clutches that had been even thinner might have broken. The white-bellied sea eagle was one of the more affected species, probably due to its feeding in areas heavily treated with pesticide such as swamps. DDT use peaked in 1973, but was no longer approved after 1987 and its use had effectively ceased by 1989.|$|E
5|$|Most {{concurrent}} use proceedings {{result in a}} legal settlement between the parties. Frequently, one party will surrender its {{concurrent use}} claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion is likely. A benefit of such an agreement is that the parties can agree to terms {{beyond the scope of}} the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> from the concurrent use registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion is likely, the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that confusion is likely, and deny registration to the junior user of the mark.|$|E

5|$|The Anahim hotspot {{is set in}} {{a remote}} {{location}} accessed by a network of logging roads from Quesnel on Highway 97. Because of this, the most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only. Although not heavily populated, the area is home to forestry operations and the small community of Nazko. The presence of burned wood within Nazko tephra suggests that this area is prone to forest fires caused by volcanic eruptions. Also, if an eruption column were to be produced, it would disrupt local air traffic. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems. Renewed volcanism is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> in the creation of mafic cinder cones. The latest such event occurred with the eruption of Nazko Cone 7,200years ago. However, eruptions of less mafic magma, typical of earlier activity of the Anahim hotspot, cannot be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|The RAN {{conducted}} armament effectiveness {{studies of}} each of the six DDL variants in parallel with Y-ARD's development of the designs. These studies found that including an area air defence capability and an ability to operate two helicopters greatly improved the DDL's effectiveness. As a result, these features were included in the Navy's specification for the DDL design which was issued in late 1970. By this time the design had evolved to specify a general-purpose destroyer of 4,200 tons, armed with a five-inch gun and a Tartar missile launcher, and capable of operating two helicopters. The changes increased the cost of building the ships, and the number planned was reduced to three. Nevertheless, the DDL design was considered <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> in very capable ships, with the 1972–73 edition of Jane's Fighting Ships commenting favourably.|$|E
5|$|After Marathon, {{probably}} in 489, Miltiades, {{the hero of}} the battle, was seriously wounded in an abortive attempt to capture Paros. Taking advantage of his incapacitation, the powerful Alcmaeonid family arranged for him to be prosecuted. The Athenian aristocracy, and indeed Greek aristocrats in general, were loath to see one person pre-eminent, and such maneuvers were commonplace. Miltiades was given a massive fine for the crime of 'deceiving the Athenian people', but died weeks later {{as a result of his}} wound. In the wake of this prosecution, the Athenian people chose to use a new institution of the democracy, which had been part of Cleisthenes's reforms, but remained so far unused. This was 'ostracism'each Athenian citizen was required to write on a shard of pottery (ostrakon) the name of a politician that they wished to see exiled for a period of ten years. This may have been triggered by Miltiades's prosecution, and used by the Athenians to try and stop such power-games among the noble families. Certainly, in the years (487BC) following, the heads of the prominent families, including the Alcmaeonids, were exiled. The career of a politician in Athens thus became fraught with more difficulty, since displeasing the population was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> in exile.|$|E

30|$|Background {{modeling}} and moving object detection {{are based on}} the adaptive background subtraction method.

50|$|Depending {{upon their}} location, the three Frisian {{languages}} have been {{heavily influenced by}} and bear similarities to Dutch, Low German/Low Saxon and/or Danish, respectively. Additional shared linguistic characteristics between the Great Yarmouth area and Friesland are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>resulted</b> from the close trading relationship these areas maintained during the centuries-long Hanseatic League of the Late Middle Ages.|$|R
5|$|By {{virtue of}} geography, the Royal Navy {{was able to}} use her {{imposing}} battleship and battlecruiser fleet to impose a strict and successful naval blockade of Germany and kept Germany's smaller battleship fleet bottled up in the North Sea: only narrow channels led to the Atlantic Ocean and these were guarded by British forces. Both sides were aware that, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, a full fleet engagement would be <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> in a British victory. The German strategy was therefore to try to provoke an engagement on their terms: either to induce a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coastline, where friendly minefields, torpedo-boats and submarines could be used to even the odds. Germany's submarines were able to break out and raid commerce, but even though they sank many merchant ships, they could not successfully blockade Great Britain – in contrast to Britain's successful battleship blockade of Germany, which was a major cause of Germany's economic collapse in 1918. The Royal Navy on the other hand, successfully adopted convoy tactics to combat Germany's submarine blockade and eventually defeated it.|$|E
