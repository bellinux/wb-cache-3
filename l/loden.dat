500|$|In 1970, a low-budget crime drama shot in 16mm by first-time American {{director}} Barbara <b>Loden</b> won {{the international}} critics' prize at the Venice Film Festival. Wanda {{is both a}} seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic B picture. The crime-based plot and often seedy settings would have suited a straightforward exploitation film or an old-school B noir. The $115,000 production, for which <b>Loden</b> spent six years raising money, was praised by Vincent Canby for [...] "the absolute accuracy of its effects, the decency of its point of view and... purity of technique." [...] Like Romero and Van Peebles, other filmmakers of the era made pictures that combined the gut-level entertainment of exploitation with biting social commentary. The first three features directed by Larry Cohen, Bone (1972), Black Caesar (1973), and Hell Up in Harlem (1973), were all nominally blaxploitation movies, but Cohen used them as vehicles for a satirical examination of race relations and the wages of dog-eat-dog capitalism. The gory horror film Deathdream (1974), directed by Bob Clark, is also an agonized protest {{of the war in}} Vietnam. Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg made serious-minded low-budget horror films whose implications are not so much ideological as psychological and existential: Shivers (1975), Rabid (1977), The Brood (1979). An Easy Rider with conceptual rigor, the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was United Artists' biker-themed Electra Glide in Blue (1973), directed by James William Guercio. The New York Times reviewer thought little of it: [...] "Under different intentions, it might have made a decent grade-C Roger Corman bike movie—though Corman has generally used more interesting directors than Guercio." ...|$|E

2500|$|Major Ted Loden: Commander {{in charge}} of soldiers, {{following}} orders issued by Lieutenant Colonel Wilford. Cleared of misconduct; Saville cited in the report that <b>Loden</b> [...] "neither realised nor should have realised that his soldiers were or might be firing at {{people who were not}} posing or about to pose a threat". The inquiry found that <b>Loden</b> could not be held responsible for claims (whether malicious or not) by some of the individual soldiers that they had received fire from snipers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, a low-budget crime drama shot in 16 mm by {{a first-time}} American {{director}} won the international critics' prize at the Venice Film Festival. Wanda, {{written and directed}} by Barbara <b>Loden,</b> is both a seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic B picture. The plot—involving a disaffected divorcée who drifts away from her coal-town life and aimlessly falls in with a small-time, would-be hardboiled crook—and the often seedy settings would have been suitable to a straightforward exploitation film or (with a little shifting of sex roles) an old-school B noir. <b>Loden,</b> who spent six years raising money for the sub-$200,000 production, created a film that Vincent Canby of the New York Times praised for [...] "the absolute accuracy of its effects, the decency of its point of view and the kind of purity of technique that can only be the result of conscious discipline." [...] While Wanda would be the only movie <b>Loden</b> ever made, she [...] "left us with a film that anticipated the independent spirit that would reinvigorate the industry." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first person}} to use the phrase was Marilyn <b>Loden,</b> during a 1978 speech. The concept of the glass ceiling was later popularized at the National Press Club in July 1979.

2500|$|Captain Mike Jackson: Second {{in command}} of 1 Para {{on the day of}} Bloody Sunday. Cleared of {{sinister}} actions following Jackson's compiling of a list of what soldiers told Major <b>Loden</b> on why they had fired. This list became known as the [...] "Loden List of Engagements" [...] which {{played a role in the}} Army's initial explanations. While the inquiry found the compiling of the list was 'far from ideal', Jackson's explanations were accepted based on the list not containing the names of soldiers and the number of times they fired.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fourteenth}} century, <b>Loden</b> Nyingpo {{revealed}} a terma containing {{the story of}} Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche. According to this terma, Dzogchen originated with {{the founder of the}} Bon tradition, Tonpa Shenrab, who lived 18,000 years ago, ruling the kingdom of Tazik, which supposedly lay west of Tibet. He transmitted these teachings to the region of Zhang-zhung, the far western part of the Tibetan cultural world. The earliest Bon literature only exists in Tibetan manuscripts, the earliest of which can be dated to the 11th century. The Bon tradition also has a threefold classification, namely Dzogchen, A-tri, and the [...] "Zhang-zhung Aural Lineage (zhang-zhung nyen-gyu).|$|E
2500|$|NICRA intended, {{despite the}} ban, to hold another anti-internment march in Derry on Sunday 30 January. The {{authorities}} decided {{to allow it}} to proceed in the Catholic areas of the city, but to stop it from reaching Guildhall Square, as planned by the organisers. The authorities expected that this would lead to rioting. Major General Robert Ford, then Commander of Land Forces in Northern Ireland, ordered that the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment (1 Para), should travel to Derry to be used to arrest possible rioters. The arrest operation was codenamed 'Operation Forecast'. The Saville Report criticised General Ford for choosing the Parachute Regiment for the operation, as it had [...] "a reputation for using excessive physical violence". The paratroopers arrived in Derry {{on the morning of the}} march and took up positions in the city. Brigadier Pat MacLellan was the operational commander and issued orders from Ebrington Barracks. He gave orders to Lieutenant Colonel Derek Wilford, commander of 1 Para. He in turn gave orders to Major Ted <b>Loden,</b> who commanded the company who launched the arrest operation.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{hold that}} Ludwig {{was murdered by}} his enemies while {{attempting}} to escape from Berg. One account suggests that the king was shot. The King's personal fisherman, Jakob Lidl (1864–1933), stated, [...] "Three years after the king's death I was made {{to swear an oath}} that I would never say certain things — not to my wife, not on my deathbed, and not to any priest … The state has undertaken to look after my family if anything should happen to me in either peacetime or war." [...] Lidl kept his oath, at least orally, but left behind notes which were found after his death. According to Lidl, he had hidden behind bushes with his boat, waiting to meet the king, in order to row him out into the lake, where loyalists were waiting to help him escape. [...] "As the king stepped up to his boat and put one foot in it, a shot rang out from the bank, apparently killing him on the spot, for the king fell across the bow of the boat." [...] However, the autopsy report indicates no scars or wounds found on the body of the dead king; on the other hand, many years later Countess Josephine von Wrba-Kaunitz would show her afternoon tea guests a grey <b>Loden</b> coat with two bullet holes in the back, asserting it was the one Ludwig was wearing. Another theory suggests that Ludwig died of natural causes (such as a heart attack or stroke) brought on by the cool water (12°C) of the lake during an escape attempt.|$|E

60|$|His figure {{interested}} her--the {{figure of}} a boy, almost a street arab. He {{made no attempt to}} conceal it. He always wore a simple <b>loden</b> suit, with knee breeches. His legs were thin, and he made no attempt to disguise the fact: which was of itself remarkable, in a German. And he never ingratiated himself anywhere, not in the slightest, but kept to himself, for all his apparent playfulness.|$|E
60|$|And Loerke was not {{a serious}} figure. In his brown velvet cap, that made his head as round as a chestnut, with the brown-velvet flaps loose and wild over his ears, and a wisp of elf-like, thin black hair blowing above his full, elf-like dark eyes, the shiny, {{transparent}} brown skin crinkling up into odd grimaces on his small-featured face, he looked an odd little boy-man, a bat. But in his figure, in the greeny <b>loden</b> suit, he looked CHETIF and puny, still strangely different from the rest.|$|E
60|$|The Professor {{announced}} {{the names of}} those present, SANS CEREMONIE. There was a bowing to the wrong people and to the right people. Everybody was there, except the man and wife. The two tall, clear-skinned, athletic daughters of the professor, with their plain-cut, dark blue blouses and <b>loden</b> skirts, their rather long, strong necks, their clear blue eyes and carefully banded hair, and their blushes, bowed and stood back; the three students bowed very low, in the humble hope of making an impression of extreme good-breeding; then there was a thin, dark-skinned man with full eyes, an odd creature, like a child, and like a troll, quick, detached; he bowed slightly; his companion, a large fair young man, stylishly dressed, blushed to the eyes and bowed very low.|$|E
