The book describes Hitchens's journey from atheism, far-left politics, and bohemianism, to Christianity and conservatism, detailing the influences on him {{that led to his}} conversion. The book is partly intended as a response to God Is Not Great, a book written by his brother Christopher Hitchens in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., {{found their}} way to Kentucky. Friendly {{considerations}} <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to patronize them. This was done through the solicitations of a young friend from Virginia. They commenced a paper, published in 1806, called the 'Western World.' Imbibing strong prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my infancy, the nurse's songs composed by Cowper, designed to make such impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment of my friends, I left Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could have, and hastened to Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and others, a deep impression had been made on my mind, that an eventful period was fast approaching.|$|E

5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) <b>led</b> <b>me</b> towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

President John Quincy Adams was a harsh critic of the decision in Palmer.

500|$|Early in 1882 Nansen took [...] "...the first fatal {{step that}} <b>led</b> <b>me</b> astray from the quiet life of science." [...] Professor Robert Collett of the university's zoology {{department}} proposed that Nansen take a sea voyage, to study Arctic zoology at first hand. Nansen was enthusiastic, and made arrangements through a recent acquaintance, Captain Axel Krefting, {{commander of the}} sealer Viking. The voyage began on 11 March 1882 and extended over the following five months. [...] In the weeks before sealing started, Nansen was able to concentrate on scientific studies. From water samples he showed that, contrary to previous assumption, sea ice forms {{on the surface of}} the water rather than below. His readings also demonstrated that the Gulf Stream flows beneath a cold layer of surface water. [...] Through the spring and early summer Viking roamed between Greenland and Spitsbergen in search of seal herds. Nansen became an expert marksman, and on one day proudly recorded that his team had shot 200 seal. In July, Viking became trapped in the ice close to an unexplored section of the Greenland coast; Nansen longed to go ashore, but this was impossible. However, he began to develop the idea that the Greenland icecap might be explored, or even crossed. On 17 July the ship broke free from the ice, and early in August was back in Norwegian waters.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{has participated}} in various {{television}} productions, such as Survival of the Fittest, which she won four seasons in a row, from 1980 to 1984; she beat Olympic athletes at rope climbing and cross-country running. It was rock climbing legend and personal hero Beverly Johnson who first asked Hill to compete. The inaugural year of the competition, the first prize for {{the men in the}} competition was US$15,000 and for the women, US$5,000. Angered, Hill asked for parity, arguing that since the women were competing in four events and the men six, the women should at least be awarded $10,000. She proposed a boycott to the other female competitors, negotiating a deal with the producer that the prize money would be raised the next year and she could compete again. In her autobiography, Hill writes that she heard a rumor that NBC canceled the women's half of the show because the producers could not find anyone to beat her. She [...] "became increasingly aware of how few women were pushing the limits of climbing and endurance like I was, and of how my passion had <b>led</b> <b>me</b> very much into a man's world". During the early 1980s Hill also appeared on The Guinness Game, That's Incredible!, and Ripley's Believe it or Not. She describes her feat of climbing over a hot-air balloon at 6,000 feet for That's Incredible! as [...] "perhaps the most ridiculous stunt I ever did". Despite the earlier television appearances Hill attributes her fame to a 1982 poster for the company Patagonia that showed a photograph of her climbing.|$|E

When Ford learned that the school had capitulated to Georgia Tech, some accounts indicate that he [...] "quit the team" [...] or threatened to quit in order [...] "to make a statement and take a stand because Willis Ward was his friend." [...] Ford wrote about the Georgia Tech incident in his autobiography, recalling that he felt the decision to keep Willis out of the game was [...] "morally wrong." [...] “I went to Willis himself. He urged me to play. [...] ‘Look,’ he said, ‘the team’s having a bad year. We’ve lost two games already and we probably won’t win any more. You’ve got to play Saturday. You owe it to the team.’ [...] I decided he was right. That Saturday afternoon, we hit like never before and beat Georgia Tech 9–2.” [...] Years later, Ford wrote that the Ward incident had influenced his thinking about race. Ford noted: “His sacrifice <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to question how educational administrators could capitulate to raw prejudice.” [...] Ford used the story to voice his support for U-M’s affirmative action admissions policy saying, “Do we really want to risk turning back the clock to an era when the Willis Wards were isolated and penalized for the color of their skin, their economic standing or national ancestry?” ...|$|E
