Darkness can aid the player in staying hidden, {{but it is only}} effective at a distance. Enemy alert meters and musical cues let the player know if they've been spotted. Noise will cause enemies to go to investigate, including noise made by broken bottles or the player striking a sword against the wall; this may be used deliberately to lure guards into traps or disrupt their patrol route. Players can look through keyholes to help them survey a room before entering, and can lean to look from cover without fully exposing themselves. The player is now able to be detected if they peer out from behind a wall for too long, a feature not seen in Dishonored. To avoid detection, the player may choke people out or have their throat slit. Bodies can be carried away and concealed. Alarms can be disabled to assure that enemies are not alerted to the player's presence. Walls of <b>Light,</b> <b>barriers</b> powered by wind or whale oil, are subject to have their power turned off or be rewired so that only enemies are killed by going through them.

25|$|German {{regulations}} mandate some {{means to}} stop a train if a person or large object should fall onto the track. Installing doors between track and platform (like on Paris's Météor Line) {{would have been the}} superior solution, but since 6 stations which were already in full operation (the section Rathenauplatz to Rothenburger Straße) needed to be converted, fitting doors to the platform edges would have led to severe service disruptions and station closures. Another problem would have been that the conventionally run trains would have had to be stopped within an area of a few centimeters by the driver, which would have been difficult. Therefore, platform doors were out of the question. After tests with laser <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> (from the station ceiling to the platform edge) at Plärrer, a combination of CCTV cameras overlooking the track bed and radio frequency barriers between from under the platform edge to the opposing wall were chosen and installed at all stations served by U3. The RF barriers will detect persons and objects falling onto the track. In such a case the ATC will stop any approaching trains on that track immediately and alert the control centre, from where an operator can visually inspect the trackbed at the platform over CCTV and then take the appropriate action.|$|E
40|$|When {{light comes}} {{into contact with}} milk, the milk will start to {{deteriorate}} and taste bad due to production of off-flavour compounds. Aseptic milk carton packages stored at ambient temperature usually have a layer of aluminium foil, which acts as a <b>barrier</b> for incoming <b>light,</b> water, oxygen and other gases. If the aluminium would not be present the <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> would mainly consist of the paperboard. In order to develop a milk package without aluminium foil for ambient storage, {{it is important to}} obtain knowledge of <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> properties of paperboard and plastic caps. When measuring the <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> in the material two spectrophotometers were used. The spectrophotometers measured the fraction of light that was able to penetrate a sample. The investigation of paperboards for 1 litre packages showed that they had protection against light of wavelengths that induced off flavour reactions with Riboflavin (220 - 375, 410 - 475 nm). But the transmission for light within the range 650 - 700 nm was above 0. 1 %. Those wavelengths induce off flavour reactions with porphyrins and chlorins. Different layers in the paperboard contribute differently to the total <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> of the paperboard. Exposing a paperboard to sunlight deteriorates its <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> in the long run, while printing on paperboard improves its <b>light</b> <b>barrier.</b> The plastic caps on packages are a fraction of the total package in term of area. But the <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> of the total package could be lacking due to the plastic caps which is why they have been investigated. Different colouring pigments give different <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> properties in the cap...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} improve the viewing angle of the {{integral}} imaging system, this paper presents a method of placing the polarizers and <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> array {{in front of the}} lenslet array.

The oregano and rosemary extracts were first characterised by both their total phenolic content and antioxidant activity, with the oregano extract showing the higher values. HPLC and confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed qualitative differences between extracts although rosmarinic acid was the most abundant phenolic compound in both. After determining the total quantities of phenolics on films, the polyphenol-protein interaction was found to be more extensive when tuna-skin gelatin was employed. However, this did not clearly affect the antioxidant properties of the films, although it could affect the phenol diffusion from film to food. The <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> properties were improved by the addition of oregano or rosemary extracts, irrespective of the type of gelatin employed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|A {{total of}} 12 groups each {{containing}} 100 year plus steelhead trout, or chinook or silver salmon were tested under four light conditions in an experimental flume with velocities of 3. 0 fps for 45 minutes, and 4. 0 fps {{for the next}} 15 minutes. The time at which each fish was impinged on the 1 / 2 inch wire mesh retaining screen at the downstream end of the flume was recorded. The four lighting conditions were: (a) 20 degree angled <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> across {{both sides of the}} flume, (b) 90 degree blocking <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> across both sides of the flume, (c) all light, and (4) all dark.

The 90 degree <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> and overall <b>light</b> were about equally effective in keeping chinooks and silvers off the screen. The 20 degree angled barrier was successful in deflecting a significant proportion of all three species into the dark channel after they were fatigued, where they were eventually impinged. The total swimming time before impingement was shortest in the dark for the chinooks and silvers, and least with the 90 degree barrier for the steelheads. The experimental condition productive of the longest swimming time for the chinooks and silvers was the 90 degree <b>barrier</b> and all <b>light</b> (no significant difference between them) and all dark for the steelheads (not significantly different from all light).

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} viewing angle {{enhancement}} method {{for both the}} LCD and projection-type 3 D integral imaging system. The proposed integral imaging system is established by using the lenslet array coupling with the polarizer array, light barrier, and the enlarged EIs. In projection-type integral imaging system, two orthogonal EIA are projected onto the projection screen simultaneously by the corresponding projectors. In LCD integral imaging system, two orthogonal EIA are displayed {{by the use of}} a LCD screen which can switch the polarization direction of the display images by time-multiplexed technology within the time constant of the eyes’ response time. The increment of viewing angle can be determined by the number of <b>light</b> <b>barriers,</b> the more the <b>light</b> <b>barriers,</b> the lager the viewing angle. The size of each elemental image can be enlarged as any positive integer multiples. Thus, the viewing angle of the integral imaging system can be improved dramatically by the improvement of the size of each elemental image according to the integral imaging principles.|$|E
30|$|In Fig. 3 (a), two {{orthogonal}} polarizers {{are placed}} in front of two projectors with the same parameters and then two EIAs with orthogonal polarization states are projected onto the projection screen by the corresponding projectors. The polarization direction of the EIA is {{the same as that of}} the polarizer in front of the projectors. The projection screen is a rear projection screen which is able to maintain the light polarization characteristics. In addition, by adding a full light barrier between different polarizers before the lenslet array, we can increase the viewing angle further. The size of each light barrier is the same as that of each lenslet. The width of each EI is 4 times that of conventional integral imaging system, and its height remains unchanged. The polarizers and <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> {{are placed in}} close proximity to the lenslet array and the polarization directions of adjacent polarizers are orthogonal. The light ray of the EIA is filtered through polarizers array and <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> array and then reaches the lenslets array. The 3 D reconstructed image can be obtained by the observer.|$|E

30|$|It {{can be seen}} in Fig. 6 {{that the}} viewing angle of the {{integral}} imaging system based on polarizers and <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> array has been significantly improved. By comparing the different view images horizontally, different parallax information can be obtained. In the range of ± 33 °, you can get the correct reconstructed image of the whole scene. The proposed method is about approximately 4 times the viewing angle of the conventional integral imaging. The different wide-viewing integral three-dimensional imaging methods proposed by Refs. [9, 10] can improve the field angle to a certain extent, but cannot more than 2 times the original viewing angle. In both modes of our manuscript, the viewing angle can be enlarged more than 2 times which is the main difference between the proposed system and the previous methods. The increment of viewing angle can be determined by the number of <b>light</b> <b>barriers,</b> the more the light barrier, the lager the viewing angle. When one light baffles array is used, the field angle will be enlarged 4 times as conventional method. The size of each elemental image can be enlarged as any positive integer multiples as the pitch of the lenslet. Thus, the viewing angle of the integral imaging system can be improved dramatically by the improvement of the size of each elemental image according to the integral imaging principles.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the field}} of {{avalanche}} warning and avalanche protection, the usage of free area (non-avalanche-secured terrain) is of high importance and was hardly estimated so far. During the winter 2004 - 05 different methods to survey and to count people in the free area were tested in the Davos area. Two methods prove to be rather efficient surveys: the <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> and the voluntary registration boards. During the winter 2005 - 06, two <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> and three voluntary registration boards were operated at four different sites in Davos, Switzerland. These surveys provided a good dataset, the first of this type for the Alps. They are {{the basis of our}} investigations regarding the behavior of backcountry and off-piste recreationists. This study showed a high sensitivity of the backcountry recreationists to the avalanche danger level. Off-piste recreationists were more sensitive to good snow conditions than backcountry recreationists. Our surveys about the usage of free area enable us to calculate the risk of an avalanche accident more precisely. The individual risk of an avalanche accident for off-piste snow sport was calculated as 7 x 10 - 5 and for backcountry snow sport as 3 x 10 - 5 per year, which is both slightly smaller than the risk of driving by car. The surveys will be continued in the future to study the variability between different years...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose to}} “boost ” {{the speed of}} {{communication}} and computation by immersing the computing environment into a medium whose index of refraction is smaller than one, thereby trespassing the speed-oflight barrier. The Church-Turing and the Cook-Karp theses, as well as other, more general limits on computation, are under permanent “scrutiny ” (cf., e. g., Ref. [1, p 11] or Ref.
