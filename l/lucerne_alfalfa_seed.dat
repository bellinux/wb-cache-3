40|$|Alfalfa (Medicago sativa subsp. sativa L.) is the world's most {{important}} forage crop. The western United States is the {{most important}} production area for both alfalfa forage and <b>alfalfa</b> <b>seed.</b> Unfortunately, feral <b>alfalfa</b> is commonly observed along roadsides, irrigation ditches, and unmanaged habitats in alfalfa growing regions. These plants can potentially lower the genetic purity of <b>alfalfa</b> <b>seed</b> when foraging bees transport pollen from feral <b>alfalfa</b> to <b>alfalfa</b> <b>seed</b> fields. The situation has become more complicated since the advent of genetically engineered (GE) alfalfa. Alfalfa was the first major perennial GE crop when the trait for glyphosate resistance (GR) was available to farmers briefly from 2005 to 2007. Regulatory issues prevented the availability of GR alfalfa until 2011 when it received final approval for commercial production in the US. In 2014, another GE trait, low-lignin alfalfa, was deregulated and will be available commercially in the near future. Because many markets have a low tolerance for GE traits, GR feral alfalfa growth in areas where conventional <b>alfalfa</b> <b>seed</b> and hay is produced for the export or organic market is of particular concern to the alfalfa industry. In response to this situation, the alfalfa industry has developed best management practices to support the coexistence of GE and conventional alfalfa production. An important management practice is to control feral <b>alfalfa</b> around both <b>seed</b> and hay fields to minimize the movement of GE traits into conventional alfalfa products. The presence of feral alfalfa plants can be reduced by effectively eliminating old alfalfa fields with tillage, transporting seed in spill-proof containers, mowing roadsides regularly, applying specific growth regulator herbicides (such as aminopyralid, dicamba, clopyralid, and 2, 4 -D), and integrating these weed management strategies (such as applying herbicides to alfalfa prior to tillage or mowing).

When alfalfa first comes into bloom the flowers are bluish-purple and the fields have a bright cast. As the blossoms are pollinated the flowers fade and take on a grayish cast, making the field appear dull colored. Utah farmers were convinced that the bees were somehow damaging the blossoms, and persuaded the state legislature in 1930 to enact an embargo against bees entering the state from other states. <b>Alfalfa</b> <b>seed</b> yields from the fields declined so precipitously that the farmers were going bankrupt.

After World War II, demand for <b>alfalfa</b> <b>seed</b> reached an all-time high.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Entomology, Washington State UniversityCross-pollination by bees is {{necessary}} for commercial <b>alfalfa</b> <b>seed</b> production. To maintain varietal purity in <b>alfalfa,</b> <b>seed</b> producers adhere to spatial isolation standards to minimize or prevent bee flight and subsequent pollen flow between fields. The increased use of genetically-engineered (GE) crops in agriculture has raised concerns over pollinator-mediated gene flow between transgenic and conventional agricultural varieties. The 2011 deregulation of genetically engineered glyphosate-resistant alfalfa by the USDA has generated public concern and scientific debate over current recommended bee management practices {{and their ability to}} maintain varietal purity of <b>alfalfa</b> grown for <b>seed</b> production. The primary objective of this research is to determine the roles that pollinators play in contributing to undesired gene flow between alfalfa fields. We evaluated the impact of migratory beekeeping practices on transgenic pollen flow between spatially isolated alfalfa fields by permitting honey bees, Apis mellifera, to openly forage upon transgenic alfalfa blossoms, and transporting them 112 km to forage on caged conventional alfalfa following either 8 or 32 hours of isolation from the transgenic source. Cross-pollination between transgenic and conventional alfalfa was nearly eliminated (0. 00008 %) following eight hours of isolation from the transgenic source. The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (ALCB), is another commercially managed pollinator used extensively in alfalfa pollination. We evaluated the influence of the ALCB on gene flow between GE and conventional <b>alfalfa</b> <b>seed</b> fields by testing for the presence of the GE trait in pollen provisions collected from domiciles located in conventional <b>alfalfa</b> <b>seed</b> fields planted directly adjacent to GE alfalfa fields. Pollen samples collected from domiciles in conventional seed fields were at variable distances from the adjacent GE fields. <b>Alfalfa</b> <b>seed</b> in the vicinity of each domicile was harvested and tested for the transgene. We found that the ALCB frequently forages at distances which exceed current estimates for ALCB foraging range. Additionally, GE trait expression in harvested conventional seed was detected at rates that surpass established thresholds for varietal purity. Measurable impacts of ALCB-mediated pollen flow were confirmed and can be used to inform science policy regarding the development of best management practices mitigating undesired gene flow between genetically distinct alfalfa varieties.
