40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 24 : 47 in lengthPini di Roma (Pines of Rome) is chronologically the second installment in Italian composer Ottorino Respighi's "Roman trilogy". It is a symphonic tone poem scored {{for a very}} large orchestra and is set in four movements. The musical content is representative of a <b>literary</b> <b>plan.</b> In Pines of Rome, Respighi succeeds spectacularly in this representation, producing a colorful and exciting group of impressions that capture the imagination without wandering or becoming digressive. Ottorino Respighi was born on July 9 th, 1879, in Bologna. A reserved boy of obvious musical talent, he began studying the violin {{when he was only}} eight and became very adept with the instrument very quickly. He was also a brilliant viola player and a more than competent pianist. At thirteen Respighi began studying composition and in 1900 composed his first major work, the Symphonic Variations, written for his final school examinations. Taking advantage of his talent on both the violin and viola, he applied for and was offered a job with the Imperial Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia. He later also played with the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow. Soon fluent in Russian, he spent some five months studying with Rimsky-Korsakov. The Russian master quickly recognized and appreciated the young Italian's flair for both composition and orchestration and looked over Respighi's shoulder offering suggestions when appropriate. It can be seen that Respighi's brilliant, colorful scores do owe something to his studies with Rimsky-Korsakov. Respighi also attended lectures and studied for a short time with Max Bruch in Berlin. One critic has described Respighi's music as "new old music. " Respighi's profound love of and identification with his Italian musical past and deliberate homage to almost forgotten composers from that past inspired such works as Ancient Airs and Dances. He paid homage in other ways also. Initially introduced to Gregorian plain chant by his wife Elsa, Respighi brilliantly used this device in many of his pieces including the second movement of Pines of Rome. Respighi was appointed Professor of Composition at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome in 1913. (See more in text. ...|$|E

The book on Morals might, however, have been written but for the heavy burden of the vice-chancellorship, which he was induced to accept in 1882, by the hope, only partially fulfilled, of securing many improvements for Oxford University. The Vice-Chancellor was ex officio a delegate of the Oxford University Press, where he hoped to effect much; and a plan for draining the Thames Valley, which he had now the power of initiating, was one on which his mind had dwelt for many years.|$|R

But now a serious attack, beyond cure. Dr. Drinkard, my Washington physician, (and a first-rate one,) {{said it was the}} result of too extreme bodily and emotional strain continued at Washington and [...] "down in front," [...] in 1863, '4 and '5. I doubt if a heartier, stronger, healthier physique, more balanced upon itself, or more unconscious, more sound, ever lived, from 1835 to '72. My greatest call (Quaker) to go around and do what I could there in those war-scenes where I had fallen, among the sick and wounded, was, that I seem'd to be so strong and well. (I consider'd myself invulnerable.) But this last attack shatter'd me completely. Quit work at Washington, and moved to Camden, New Jersey--where I have lived since, receiving many buffets and some precious caresses--and now write these lines. Since then, (1874-'91) a long stretch of illness, or half-illness, with occasional lulls. During these latter, have revised and printed over all my books--bro't out [...] "November Boughs"--and at intervals leisurely and exploringly travel'd to the Prairie States, the Rocky Mountains, Canada, to New York, to my birthplace in Long Island, and to Boston. But physical disability and the war-paralysis above alluded to to have settled upon me more and more the last year or so. Am now (1891) domicil'd, and have been for some years, in this little old cottage and lot in Mickle street, Camden, with a house-keeper and man nurse. Bodily I am completely disabled, but still write for publication. I keep generally buoyant spirits, write often as there comes any lull in physical sufferings, get in the sun and down to the river whenever I can, retain fair appetite, assimilation and digestion, sensibilities acute as ever, the strength and volition of my right arm good, eyesight dimming, but brain normal, and retain my heart's and soul's unmitigated faith not only in their own original <b>literary</b> <b>plans,</b> but in the essential bulk of American humanity east and west, north and south, city and country, through thick and thin, to the last.

Section 1, The irrelevance of the avant-garde, considers the relation between such academic adventures as semiotics and poststructuralism {{on the one hand and}} the theory of language and the practice of translation on the other, and argues that radical antiscientism does not bear on the foundations of translation. Section 2, The irrelevance of the technical, looks at formal syntax and semantics in relation to the concepts of applied linguistics and shows that careful contemporary linguistics cannot underpin an applied enterprise that includes translation studies. Section 3, The substantive hase of translation, indicates (in some detail for translation and at a general level for other applied linguistic activities) the direction that the contemporary integration of various lines of linguistic research is taking vis-à-vis the needs of such applied enterprises as translation, <b>literary</b> studies, language <b>planning,</b> lexicography, and language teaching. Section 3 invokes a concept of substance as opposed to form and thus sets the scene for the concluding section 4, Pragmatics, applied studies, and scientific progress, which argues that it is necessary to take help from linguistics in order to construct the field of translation studies in such a way that practitioners can truly benefit freely from all relevant branches of knowledge, in view of the fact that chaos is an obstacle to genuine freedom. Les sujet étudiés dans cet article se situent à la limite entre la théorie linguistique et les fondements de la linguistique appliquée dans la pratique de la traduction. On y affirme i) qu'un antiscientisme radical ne porte pas les fondements de la traduction; ii) que la linguistique contemporaine modérée ne peut soutenir n'importe quelle entreprise incluant l'étude de la traduction; et iii) qu'il est nécessaire d'accepter l'aide que la linguistique peut apporter dans le champ des études traductionnelles de façon à ce que les praticiens puissent bénéficier librement de toutes les branches de la connaissance puisque l'on croit que le chaos est un obstacle à la liberté réelle...|$|R
40|$|Inclusive {{differentiated}} {{instruction is}} {{a new model of}} didactic instruction, theoretically described and established in this paper for the first time, after being experimentally verified through teaching of the mother tongue (instruction in reading and literature). Inclusive individually planned instruction is based on a phenomenological and constructivist didactic instructional paradigm. This type of teaching is essentially developmental and person-oriented. The key stages of inclusive differentiated instruction of literature are: 1) recognition of individual students' potential and educational needs regarding reading and work on <b>literary</b> texts; 2) <b>planning</b> and preparation of inclusive individually planned instruction in reading and literature; 3) actual class teaching of lessons thus prepared; and 4) evaluation of the student achievement following inclusive differentiated instruction in reading and literature. A highly important element of the planning and preparation of inclusive differentiated instruction is the creation of student profiles and inclusive individualized syllabi. Individualized syllabi specify the following: 1. a brief student profile; 2. the student position on the continuum of the learning outcomes of instruction in the Serbian language; 3. reverse-engineered macro-plan stages of instruction in the Serbian language (3. 1. identifying expected outcomes and fundamental qualities of learners' work, 3. 2. defining acceptable proofs of their realisation, 3. 3. planning learning and teaching experiences, and 3. 4. providing material and technical requisites for teaching); 4) the contents and procedure of individualized lessons targeting the student; 5) a plan of syllabus implementation monitoring and evaluation. The continuum of the learning outcomes of inclusive differentiated instruction in literature exists at three main levels, A, B and C. The three levels are: A) reading techniques and learning about the main literary theory concepts; B) expressive reading and information reception and comprehension; and C) critical and creative reading and creative information processing. The students assigned to the experimental group learnt about and acquired literary theory concepts and special characteristics of literary genres within their 'zones of proximal development,' while the lessons taught to the control group were structured to suit an average or imaginary student. The same requirements were set on all students in the control group, regardless of their individual level of familiarity with literary theory notions and concepts {{and the degree to which}} they were capable of comprehending and experiencing a literary text. The results of the experiment carried out with such parallel groups show that the achievement of the students included in the experimental group, who were taught according to individualized instruction plans, was better in a way that was statistically significant, in comparison with both their knowledge of the subject matter before the experiment and the control group, whose members attended classes organized in a predominantly traditional, non-individualistic way...|$|R
