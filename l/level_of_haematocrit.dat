40|$|Nigeria has {{the fourth}} highest {{prevalence}} of TB {{and the highest}} prevalence of Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) in the world. SCA patients have impaired immunity and are vulnerable to TB. Hence, we studied the haematological indices of SCA patients with TB in Nigeria. A total of 23 SCA patients with TB were studied in parallel with equal number of age and sex matched SCA patients without TB. SCA patients with TB had significantly lower haematocrit, higher level of circulating sickle cells (CSCs) and similar level of reticulocyte count in comparison to patients without TB. SCA patients with TB had significantly higher mean WBC count {{associated with higher frequency}} of neutrophilia in comparison to those without TB. Monocytosis and eosinopenia were exclusively found in SCA patients with TB at frequencies of 52 % and 65 % respectively. Lymphocyte and basophil counts were normal in all patients with and without TB. Mean platelet counts were high in both patient groups but the frequency of thrombocytosis was significantly higher in patients with TB. SCA patients with TB had significantly higher mean ESR than their counterparts without the infection. The findings of this study revealed that TB in SCA patients was associated with rising level of CSCs, falling <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>haematocrit,</b> sub-optimal reticulocytosis, neutrophilia, monocytosis, thrombocytosis, eosinopenia and rising level of ESR.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to establish the blood groups as well as haematology indicators in one of Croatia’s indigenous breeds, Dalmatian dogs. 40 healthy dogs were examined. The ages ranged from 2 months to 12 years. Blood samples were taken from all animals in order to determine blood group DEA (Dog Erythrocyte Antigen) 1. 1. and a standard haemogram. In 38 dogs (95 %) the DEA 1. 1. blood group was found. The findings obtained indicate that the incidence of DEA 1. 1. blood group among Dalmatian dogs was higher than in other dog breed but this data included data about other Croatian indigenous breeds. The average haematology indicators were not within canine physiological standards because the haemoglobin concentration as well as <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>haematocrit</b> and MCV were higher than reference values.

In the control group there was scarcely any change in the total mass of intravascular plasma protein with change in posture, but in the pathological group this was often considerable. This was interpreted as indicating increased permeability of the capillaries to protein. Attention is drawn to the influence of uncontrolled alterations in posture on biochemical and haematological measurements and a recommendation is made in order to standardize conditions before taking blood for the analysis of non-diffusible constituents.

40|$|Background: Preeclampsia is {{of major}} {{complications}} of pregnancy that {{is associated with}} maternal morbidity and mortality. Therefore, prediction and early diagnosis of preeclampsia would be helpful for better controlling of related complications. Our study aimed to investigate risk factors helping to predict and early diagnose of preeclampsia. Materials and Methods: A total of 739 nulliparous women at their 24 - 28 th weeks of the first pregnancy were enrolled in this multi-center cohort study. Incidence or absence of preeclampsia in this population was evaluated up to the end of pregnancy period. For each case, a record sheet was assigned that contained information about haematocrit level in weeks 24 - 28 th of pregnancy, blood pressure, result of roll-over test in weeks 24 - 28 th of pregnancy and the presence of disease up to end of the study. Diagnosis of preeclampsia was made based on gold standard. Results : Overall, 3. 9 % of all cases developed preeclampsia. The mean maternal age, body mass index (BMI), years of education and positive roll-over test were significantly higher in preeclampsia group (P < 0. 001). However, the mean gestational age and changes in the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>haematocrit</b> were significantly higher in normotensive cases (P < 0. 001).

The aim was to experimentally evaluate the effect of n- 3 HUFA dietary content on cardio-respiratory performances of the golden grey mullet (Liza aurata), a microalgae grazer of high ecological importance in European coastal areas. These performances were evaluated in terms of critical swimming speed U (crit), associated oxygen consumption MO 2, post-exercise oxygen consumption and calcium fluxes in cardiomyocytes. Two replicated groups of fish were fed on a rich (standard diet, SD diet: 1. 2 % n- 3 HUFA on dry matter basis, DMB) or a poor n- 3 HUFA (low n- 3 HUFA diet, LD diet: 0. 2 % n- 3 HUFA on DMB) diet during 5 months and were called SD and LD groups, respectively. The {{results showed that the}} LD diet reduced growth rate as well as the aerobic capacity of L. aurata at 20 A degrees C, suggesting that fish may have to save energy by modifying the proportion of energy allocated to energy-demanding activities, such as digestion or feeding. In addition, this LD diet induced higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>haematocrit</b> and plasma osmolality, indicating a stress response at the second and third levels in that group. However, the LD diet caused a massive increase in swimming efficiency. This should improve the capacity of L. aurata to migrate and to forage over a wide area. In turn, these could then compensate for the reduction in growth rate and aerobic metabolism...|$|R

The lowest haematocrit after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery (LHCT) {{has been identified as}} a risk factor for kidney dysfunction after cardiac surgery. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine whether different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>haematocrit</b> during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery are related to kidney dysfunction. Methods and results-A prospective study was conducted on consecutive adult patients undergoing myocardial revascularization. Preoperative renal function was assessed by baseline serum creatinine level (CrPre). Peak postoperative creatinine (CrPost) was defined as the highest daily in-hospital postoperative value. Peak fractional change in creatinine (% Delta Cr) was defined as the difference between the CrPre and CrePost represented as a percentage of the preoperative value. The LHTC was defined as the lowest recorded haematocrit prior to weaning from the initial pump run. A category variable was created for haematocrit based on the distribution of values. The category variable had the following cut-off points: less than 23 %, 23. 1 to 28 % and greater than 28. 1 %. Lowest haematocrit (26. 62 +/- 4. 15 %), CPB (74. 71 +/- 24. 90 min), CrPre (1. 23 +/- 0. 37 mg/dl) and highest CrPost (1. 52 +/- 0. 47 mg/dl) data varied in near-normal fashion. Statistical significance has been observed in the 0. 05).

40|$|Lack of food {{resources}} {{has been suggested}} as a factor which limits the growth of cyclic vole populations. During peak phases of the cycle, vole population growth typically ceases during late autumn or early winter, and {{is followed by a}} decrease in density over the winter. To investigate whether this decrease is due to increased mortality induced by a depletion of {{food resources}}, we studied overwinter food consumption and physiological condition of field voles (Microtus agrestis) in western Finland in both an increase and a decrease phase of a three-year population cycle. The growth rate of vole populations was negatively related both to prevailing vole densities and to densities six months earlier. The condition index of voles, as well as their blood <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>haematocrit,</b> proteins, free fatty acids and immunoglobulin G, were positively related to population growth rate when populations were declining. When populations were increasing, these parameters tended to be negatively related to population growth rate. The overall physiological condition of voles was lower in the winter of the decrease phase as compared to the increase phase. The return rate of voles, a proxy of survival, was also lower in the decrease than in the increase phase of the cycle and positively related to haematocrit levels. Almost 90 % of all green vegetation shoots were consumed by voles during the winter of the decrease phase while only two thirds were eaten in the increase phase. Our results suggest that the winter decrease phase of cyclic vole populations is associated with both a deterioration in the physiological condition of voles and a significant depletion of winte...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{standardized}} test used {{for evaluating the}} effect of warfarin is the prothrombin time (PT) which is measured and expressed in international normalized ratio (INR). Regular control of treatment intensity is required since inappropriate dosage increases the risk for complications. Portable point-of-care analytical instruments for measurement of capillary whole blood PT have been available for the last decades. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare and evaluate INR values obtained by the point-of-care device CoaguChek XS, to Owren PT in a hospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 397 warfarin-treated patients, capillary whole blood was analyzed with the CoaguChek XS and the results were compared to analysis of venous plasma samples with the Owren PT assay. To study reproducibility and rule out preanalytical errors, a subgroup of 152 patients had two capillary blood samples analyzed with the CoaguChek XS. RESULTS: In 397 patients, with a median age(+/- 2 SD) of 69. 0 (50 - 88) years, there was a positive correlation between results from the CoaguChek XS and the Owren-type PT assay (r= 0. 94;p< 0. 001) and concordance of 88. 2 %. The mean INR difference (S. D) was 0. 02 (0. 22). Comparison of the 152 double samples analyzed with the CoaguChek XS, produced a positive correlation of 0. 99; p< 0. 001. CONCLUSIONS: The CoaguChek XS presents reproducible, highly comparable results with Owren PT at therapeutic <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> INR. The CoaguChek XS seems to produce better results than the earlier CoaguChek S, probably due to a new method of PT measurement where <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> fibrinogen and <b>haematocrit</b> do not affect the outcome...|$|R

In order to clarify this point, genetic and environmental components of phenotypic variation for a number of traits were estimated in nestling Barn Swallows Hirundo rustica by means of a partial cross-fostering experiment. The studied traits were haematocrit, two morphological traits used as estimates of condition in birds (body mass and body mass relative to body size) and a morphological trait that presumably is not associated with condition (tarsus length). First, we found that body mass relative to body size was related to haematocrit, supporting the suggestion that haematocrit reflects condition in this species. Secondly, we found that the coefficient of residual (i. e. environmental) variation <b>of</b> <b>haematocrit</b> was larger than that of tarsus length, but smaller than those of body mass or body mass relative to body size. Under the hypothesis that traits closely related to condition (and, ultimately, to fitness) are characterized by large residual variance, these results also suggest that haematocrit is relate...|$|R

50|$|First {{symptoms}} may be subtle such as mild pain, flank tenderness, haematuria. Depending {{on blood}} loss, symptoms of hypovolemic shock may develop. Hematoma is usually {{contained in the}} retroperitoneum, allowing {{for a period of}} haemodynamic stability. Sometimes massive acute hemorrhage is seen when a hematoma ruptures Gerota's fascia and extends into the peritoneum. An ultrasound or CT scan can establish diagnosis, while lab tests may be inconclusive as changes <b>of</b> <b>haematocrit</b> or haemoglobin are not specific to the syndrome, while haematuria is not always present.|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{report a}} field study <b>of</b> the <b>haematocrit</b> <b>of</b> pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) nestlings when close to fledging. First a {{descriptive}} {{study was conducted}} of both fledgling and adult haematocrit over 2 years to analyse correlates of variation in this trait. Then a swapping experiment was performed to see whether variation among fledglings had a measurable genetic component. Average fledgling haematocrits were {{lower than those of}} their male and female parents. Intraclass correlations among sibships in fledgling haematocrit were high in both years, indicating that the estimates of resemblance were inflated, probably by common envi-ronmental eects. Fledgling haematocrits were unrelated to date and number of young in the nest. Fledglings with a high haematocrit were heavy and had thick breast muscles. There were no significant relationships between the average fledgling <b>haematocrit</b> and those <b>of</b> the adults caring for them. Nest mite ectoparasites negatively af-fected fledgling <b>haematocrit.</b> The <b>haematocrits</b> <b>of</b> adults did not dier between sexes or years and in both sexes were unrelated to breeding date, body mass, age, clutch size or number of young reared. Females, but not males, caring for fledglings in nests infested by mites had a lower haematocrit than those rearing young in mite-free nests. The cross-fostering experiment indicated that al-most all measured variation in haematocrit was ex-plained by the nest where the bird was reared (67. 2 % of the explained variance), not by their nest of origin (7. 8 %), meaning that there was a very small, non-sig-nificant resemblance in the <b>haematocrit</b> <b>of</b> genetically related sibs when reared in dierent environments while unrelated nestlings reared in the same nestbox had similar haematocrits. The low proportion of variance explained by the familial component {{may be due to the}} high connection <b>of</b> <b>haematocrit</b> to fitness.

40|$|There {{is clear}} {{clinical}} evidence that tumours in anaemic patients {{are difficult to}} control with radiotherapy. We have studied the radiosensitivity of two transplantable mouse tumours, the SCCVII/St carcinoma and the KHT sarcoma in hosts made anaemic either with an iron poor diet or {{as a result of}} tumour growth. The haemoglobin <b>level</b> and <b>haematocrits</b> <b>of</b> mice on the low iron diet fell to about 60 % of normal within 11 weeks. The number of clonogenic cells after a single X-ray dose of 20 Gy was slightly lower (P less than 0. 05) in the anaemic animals (2. 3 X 10 (4) g- 1) than in controls (5. 2 X 10 (4) g- 1) though {{there was no significant difference}} in the surviving fractions. Mice bearing KHT tumours became anaemic with haematocrits falling to 65 % of normal as their tumours grew from 300 - 1200 mg. A second 'test' tumour was implanted one week after the first 'anaemia-inducing' tumour so that estimates of radiosensitivity could all be carried out on tumours within the same size range (150 - 300 mg). Radiosensitivity was significantly greater in the most anaemic hosts with 2. 2 X 10 (4) cells g- 1 surviving a dose of 20 Gy compared with 6. 7 x 10 (4) g- 1 in controls (P less than 0. 01). These results are consistent with most published data for mouse tumours though not for many human tumours...|$|R

40|$|Bioimpedance {{has shown}} {{potential}} as a method for characterising biological tissue {{with the use of}} the tetrapolar electrode configuration. This configuration has been shown to distinguish between normal squamous epithelium and Cervical Intra-epithelial Neoplasia (CIN) [1]. The tetrapolar configuration has also been shown to produce anomalous results in the form of an increase in measured impedance when a low impedance lesion is located between a drive and measurement electrode [2]. We have investigated a possible solution to this problem using bioimpedance mapping employing an array of 25 (5 x 5) electrodes. The array allows 64 individual tetrapolar measurements to be taken on 16 locations giving an impedance map of 49 mm 2 on the surface of a tissue sample. Multiple measurements at each location reduce the chance of anomalous results since these can later be identified and excluded. Preliminary results on bovine blood have shown good separation of the measured impedance between areas <b>of</b> different <b>haematocrit</b> and provided a visual representation of the surface impedance. Impedance maps have been obtained for a range <b>of</b> <b>haematocrit</b> between 0 - 80 %...|$|R
