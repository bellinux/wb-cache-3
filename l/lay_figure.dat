In early January 1824, Etty finally returned to London.|$|E
25|$|Rodrigo Pérez de Traba (floruit 1111–1158/65), called el Velloso ("the Hairy"), was a Galician magnate {{whose career}} {{corresponds}} to the entire period from the coronation of Alfonso VII as co-ruler of León (1111) until his death (1157). He served Alfonso at court in his early years, but was given increased responsibility in Galicia {{after the death of}} Alfonso's mother, Queen Urraca (1126). After about 1132 he became increasingly involved in the politics of Portugal, whose invasion of Galicia he supported in 1137. Even after León and Portugal made peace in 1141 Rodrigo was largely excluded from Leonese politics, with the notable exception of the military campaigns of 1147, until 1152. Thereafter until his death he was the dominant <b>lay</b> <b>figure</b> in Galicia.|$|E
25|$|For {{the right}} wall, which {{features}} a double mullioned window, Pinturicchio adopted an illusionistic perspective, painting two fake symmetrical windows, one with a blessing Eternal Father and one with a dove, an early Christian symbol of eternal life. The wall contains also two scenes with episodes {{of the life of}} St. Francis of Assisi: The first is the Renunciation to the Patrimony, characterized by an oblique perspective, which takes advantage of the piers of the arches, having a grotesque decoration; the second depicts St. Francis Receiving the Stigmata, featuring in the background a view of the Verna Sanctuary over a rocky peak. Under the real window is an illusory opening with five characters: among them is an aged friar, perhaps the convent's prior, and a <b>lay</b> <b>figure</b> that resembles him, perhaps an administrator of the basilica.|$|E

"He has the {{instinct}} of the thing: his narrative has distinction, his characters and incidents have the picturesque quality, {{and he has}} the sense for the scale of character-drawing demanded by romance, hitting the happy mean between <b>lay</b> <b>figures</b> and over-analyzed 'souls.'" ...|$|R
50|$|The artist’s soft sculptures, {{made from}} fabric stuffed with fiber fill, take many forms. The artist has {{presented}} large vampire mouths and double vampire mouths with fabric blood drops that hang from their fabric teeth. Other forms include “husbands” modeled {{on a particular}} pillow shape that is sold commercially, and <b>laying</b> <b>figures</b> which resemble oversized human forms.|$|R

50|$|Wax-works, not {{intended}} as fine art, subsequently became popular attractions, consisting principally {{of images of}} historical or notorious personages, made up of waxen masks on <b>lay</b> <b>figures</b> in which sometimes mechanism is fitted to give motion to the figure. Such an exhibition of wax-works with mechanical motions was shown in Germany early in the eighteenth century.|$|R
50|$|The {{ambulatory}} contains three outstanding Gothic tombs {{from the}} mid-14th century. One tomb belongs to Lopo Fernandes Pacheco, 7th Lord of Ferreira de Aves, a nobleman {{at the service}} of King Afonso IV. His <b>laying</b> <b>figure</b> appears holding his sword and is guarded by a dog. His wife, Maria de Vilalobos, appears over her tomb reading a Book of Hours. The third tomb belongs to an unidentified royal princess. All tombs are decorated with coats-of-arms.|$|R

60|$|He {{turned over}} a few half-finished sketches, drummed on a new canvas, cleaned three brushes, set Binkie to bite the toes of the <b>lay</b> <b>figure,</b> rattled through his {{collection}} of arms and accoutrements, and then went out abruptly, declaring {{that he had done}} enough for the day.|$|E
60|$|As for his humour; he, alas! can be dirty {{like the}} rest, when necessary: but humour he has {{of the highest}} quality. 'The Ordinary' is full of it; and Moth, the Antiquary, though {{too much of a}} <b>lay</b> <b>figure,</b> and {{depending}} for his amusingness on his quaint antiquated language, is such a sketch as Mr. Dickens need not have been ashamed to draw.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Ferris {{went into}} another room, {{through the open}} door of which Don Ippolito saw the {{paraphernalia}} of a painter's studio: an easel with a half-finished picture on it; a chair with a palette and brushes, and crushed and twisted tubes of colors; a <b>lay</b> <b>figure</b> in one corner; on the walls scraps of stamped leather, rags of tapestry, desultory sketches on paper.|$|E
2500|$|Before forming Fluke, Fugler and Bryant {{had played}} in two punk bands {{together}} named The Leaky Radiators and The <b>Lay</b> <b>Figures.</b> The third member of Fluke, Tournier, {{was introduced to the}} group when he undertook work on a collaboration with Fugler entitled [...] "Skin". It soon became clear that all three shared musical tastes, having a shared interest in the acid house scene and the more experimental electronic sounds of Cabaret Voltaire and Giorgio Moroder. Finally, with Nugent in a managerial role, Fluke was born.|$|R
60|$|For instance, if {{they are}} told that their holy hearts are wrong, they spend time and much money in rushing to a place called Nauheim in Germany, to put them right by means of water-drinking, thereby {{shortening}} their hours of heavenly bliss and depriving their heirs of {{a certain amount of}} cash. The same thing applies to Buxton in my own neighbourhood and gout, especially when it threatens the stomach or the throat. Even archbishops will do these things, to say nothing of such small fry as deans, or stout and prominent <b>lay</b> <b>figures</b> of the Church.|$|R

5000|$|Nise-e (似絵), or [...] "likeness pictures," [...] were a {{style of}} {{portraiture}} popular in the court circles of Japan's Kamakura period. Prior to the 12th century Japanese art was purely religious in character, but nise-e introduced the realistic depiction of <b>lay</b> <b>figures</b> such as courtiers and samurai. The popularity of nise-e even helped to end the taboo against artistic depictions of the emperor, with one of earliest nise-e to depict a living emperor being a portrait of Emperor Hanazono by Gōshin. The aim of a nise-e portrait was to capture a man's character with a few simple lines; and the work served as a veneration of his accomplishments.|$|R
60|$|Inside the den {{they saw}} the strange white ape lying half across a table, his head buried in his arms; and on the bed <b>lay</b> a <b>figure</b> covered by a sailcloth, while from a tiny rustic cradle came the plaintive wailing of a babe.|$|R

60|$|This in {{her case}} was more than anyone could do, and as she stood {{listening}} a tear splashed upon her closed hands. The man, by comparison with whom Gregory appeared a mere <b>lay</b> <b>figure,</b> was in all probability lying still far up in the solitudes of the frozen North, with his last grim journey done. This time, however, he had not carried her picture with him. Gregory was to blame for that, {{and it was the}} one thing she could not forgive him.|$|E
60|$|The {{mother was}} a pleasant, {{comfortable}} woman harassed by something, she did not quite know what. The pastor was a ginger-haired caricature imitated from the northern stage, quite a <b>lay</b> <b>figure.</b> The peasants never laughed, they watched solemnly and absorbedly like children. The servant was just a slim, pert, forward hussy, much too flagrant. And then the son, the actor-manager: he was a dark, ruddy man, broad and thick-set, evidently of peasant origin, but with some education now; he was the important figure, the play was his.|$|E
6000|$|The armourer {{led them}} to an inner room. [...] "These are my best suits," [...] he said, {{pointing}} to a score of <b>lay</b> <b>figures</b> in armour ranged along the wall. [...] "They would soon get tarnished were they exposed to the fogs of London. They are all of foreign make save these two, which, as you see, are less ornamented than the rest. The others are all of Spanish or Milanese workmanship. These two suits are my own make. Our craftsmen are not so skilled in inlaying or ornamenting as the foreigners, but I will guarantee the temper of the steel and its strength to keep out a lance thrust, a cross-bow bolt, or a cloth-yard arrow against the best of them." ...|$|R
2500|$|A debtera is an [...] <b>lay</b> priest <b>figure</b> {{trained by}} the Church as a scribe, cantor, and often as a folk healer, who may also {{function}} in roles comparable to a deacon or exorcist. Folklore and legends ascribe the role of magician to the Debtera as well.|$|R

"So far," [...] she continued, eyeing hungrily {{the last}} morsel of roll which lay upon her plate, [...] "my only chance of {{occupation}} has lain with a photographer who engaged {{me on the}} spot and insulted me in half an hour. What beasts men are! I cannot typewrite, my three stories are still wandering round, two milliners have refused me as a <b>lay</b> <b>figure</b> because business was so bad.

6000|$|I confess I never, {{never should}} have guessed the name; not though I had guessed to Doomsday. In the first place I {{do not believe in}} Ossian, and having {{partially}} examined the testimony (for I don't pretend to any exact learning about it) I consider him as the poetical <b>lay</b> <b>figure</b> upon which Mr. Macpherson dared to cast his personality. There is a sort of phraseology, nay, an identity of occasional phrases, from the antique--but that these so-called Ossianic poems were ever discovered and translated as they stand in their present form, I believe in no wise. As Dr. Johnson wrote to Macpherson, so I would say, 'Mr. Macpherson, I thought you an impostor, and think so still.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Whether {{looking through}} a glass at distant objects enabled Paula to bottle up her affection for the absent one, or whether her friend Charlotte had so little {{personality}} in Paula's regard that she could commune with her as with a <b>lay</b> <b>figure,</b> it was certain that she evinced remarkable ease in speaking of Somerset, resuming her words {{about him in the}} tone of one to whom he was at most an ordinary professional adviser. 'It would be very awkward for the works at the castle if he has got into a scrape. I suppose the builders were well posted with instructions before he left: but he ought certainly to return soon.
