50|$|The generic FLASH {{technique}} {{emerges as}} a gradient echo sequence which combines a low-flip angle radio-frequency excitation of the NMR signal (recorded as a spatially encoded gradient echo) with a rapid repetition of the basic sequence. The repetition time is usually much shorter than the typical T1 relaxation time of the protons in biologic tissue. Only the combination of (i) a low-flip angle excitation which leaves unused <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetization</b> for an immediate next excitation with (ii) the acquisition of a gradient echo which does not need a further radio-frequency pulse that would affect the residual <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetization,</b> allows for the rapid repetition of the basic sequence interval and the resulting speed of the entire image acquisition. In fact, the FLASH sequence eliminated all waiting periods previously included to accommodate effects from T1 saturation. FLASH reduced the typical sequence interval to what is minimally required for imaging: a slice-selective radio-frequency pulse and gradient, a phase-encoding gradient, and a (reversed) frequency-encoding gradient generating the echo for data acquisition.|$|E

This gives a net polarization that is parallel to the external field. Application of a radio frequency (RF) pulse can tip this net polarization vector sideways (with, i.e., a so-called 90° pulse), or even reverse it (with a so-called 180° pulse).|$|E
40|$|We have derived the {{magneto-optical}} Kerr matrix {{based on}} the circular-polarization eigenmode instead of the linear-polarization mode by using arbitrary-eigenmode transformation matrices. The Kerr matrix derived here is given simply {{in terms of the}} well-known reflection coefficients of the linear-polarization mode. Using the derived Kerr matrix, we have calculated the amplitudes and the phases of the electric fields of individually separated left- and right-handed circular components of waves reflected from a model system of Co (100 Å) /Si substrate with either orientation of opposite <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetizations</b> for s-polarized incident X-rays at the Co L_ 3 edge (hν= 778. 1 eV) and far below it (hν= 770. 1 eV). From these calculations, we can readily determine the Kerr rotation, the Kerr ellipticity, the Kerr intensity, and the degree of circular polarization of the reflected waves. The Kerr matrix of the circular-polarization mode is found to be very useful in theoretical and experimental investigations of a variety of magnetic thin films because of its ability to decompose individual components of any polarization eigenmodes. clos...|$|R

An exact calculation reveals that P(M_z) is a Gaussian both at j_E= 0 and j_E not equal 0, and the width of the distribution decreases with increasing energy flux. The distribution of the order-parameter fluctuations, P(M_x), is evaluated numerically for spin-chains of up to 20 spins. For the equilibrium case (j_E= 0), we find the expected Gaussian fluctuations away from the critical point while the critical order-parameter fluctuations are shown to be non-gaussian with a scaling function Phi(x) =Phi(M_x/) = P(M_x) strongly dependent on the boundary conditions. When j_E not equal 0, the system displays long-range, oscillating correlations but P(M_x) is a Gaussian nevertheless, and the width of the Gaussian decreases with increasing j_E. In particular, we find that, at critical transverse field, the width has a j_E^(- 3 / 8) asymptotic in the j_E -> 0 limit. Comment: 8 pages, 5 ps figure...|$|R

50|$|The {{recovery}} of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetization</b> is called longitudinal or T1 relaxation and occurs exponentially {{with a time}} constant T1. The loss of phase coherence in the transverse plane is called transverse or T2 relaxation. T1 is thus associated with the enthalpy of the spin system, {{or the number of}} nuclei with parallel versus anti-parallel spin. T2 on the other hand is associated with the entropy of the system, or the number of nuclei in phase.|$|E
50|$|Steady-state free {{precession}} (SSFP) imaging is {{a magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) technique which uses steady states of magnetizations. In general, SSFP MRI sequences {{are based on a}} (low flip angle) gradient-echo MRI sequence with a short repetition time which in its generic form has been described as the FLASH MRI technique. While spoiled gradient-echo sequences refer to a steady state of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetization</b> only, SSFP gradient-echo sequences include transverse coherences (magnetizations) from overlapping multi-order spin echoes and stimulated echoes. This is usually accomplished by refocusing the phase-encoding gradient in each repetition interval {{in order to keep the}} phase integral (or gradient moment) constant. Fully balanced SSFP MRI sequences achieve a phase of zero by refocusing all imaging gradients.|$|E
50|$|When {{the radio}} {{frequency}} pulse is turned off, the transverse vector component produces an oscillating magnetic field which induces a small current in the receiver coil. This signal {{is called the}} free induction decay (FID). In an idealized nuclear magnetic resonance experiment, the FID decays approximately exponentially with a time constant T2. However in practical MRI there are small differences in the static magnetic field at different spatial locations ("inhomogeneities") that cause the Larmor frequency to vary across the body. This creates destructive interference, which shortens the FID. The time constant for the observed decay of the FID is called the T relaxation time, and is always shorter than T2. At the same time, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetization</b> starts to recover exponentially with a time constant T1 which is much larger than T2 (see below).|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} to create Long-Lived spin States (LLSs) from <b>longitudinal</b> spin <b>magnetization,</b> {{which is based}} on adiabatic switching of a Radio-Frequency (RF) field with proper frequency. The technique is simple to implement with standard Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) equipment, providing an excellent conversion of population from the triplet T+ (or T-) state to the singlet state of a pair of spins and back. The method has been tested for the amino acid tyrosine and its partially deuterated isotopomer; for the deuterated compound, we have achieved a LLS lifetime, which exceeds the longitudinal relaxation time by a factor of 21. Furthermore, by slightly modifying the method, an enhanced contrast with respect to LLSs in NMR spectra is achieved; contrast enhancements of more than 1200 are feasible. This enables efficient suppression of <b>longitudinal</b> spin <b>magnetization</b> in NMR allowing one to look selectively at LLSs. Using this method we have demonstrated that not only spectral but also spatial contrast can be achieved: we have obtained spatial NMR images with strongly improved contrast originating from the difference of LLS lifetimes at different positions in the sample...|$|R
40|$|The XXZ {{model on}} a square lattice in the {{presence}} of a transverse magnetic field is studied within the spin wave theory to investigate the resulting canted antiferromagnet. The small and large field regimes are probed separately both for easy-axis and easy-plane scenarios which reveal an unentangled factorized ground state at an intermediate value of the field. Goldstone modes are obtained for the field-free $XY$ antiferromagnet as well as for the isotropic antiferromagnet with field up to its saturation value. Moreover, for an easy-plane anisotropy, we find that there exists a non-zero field, where magnon degeneracy appears as a result of restoration of an U(1) sublattice symmetry and that, across that field, there occurs a magnon band crossing. For completeness, we then obtain the system phase diagram for $S= 1 / 2 $ via large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations using the stochastic series expansion technique. Our numerical method is based on a quantization of spin along the direction of the applied magnetic field and does not suffer from a sign-problem, unlike comparable algorithms based on a spin quantization along the axis of anisotropy. With this formalism, we are also able to obtain powder averages of the transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetizations,</b> which may be useful for understanding experimental measurements on polycrystalline samples.

40|$|An {{efficient}} soft x-ray polarizer that {{is able to}} optically {{convert a}} linear polarization state to any orthogonal state of not only linear but also circular polarization modes is found by means of numerical calculations of the intensities of individual orthogonal polarization components in reflected waves. Calculation results, using the known linear-polarization-mode based Kerr matrix {{as well as a}} newly derived circular-polarization-mode based Kerr matrix, indicate that a + 45 ° or - 45 ° linearly polarized incident wave can be readily converted to any orthogonal states of both circular and linear polarization modes, i. e., left- and right-handed circular and s - and p -linear polarizations through reflection, at certain grazing angles of incidence near the critical angle from a simple ferromagnetic thin film of Co (9. 0 nm) Si substrate. The intensities of almost pure circularly or linearly polarized reflected waves are about 10 % or less in a certain spectral soft x-ray range just below the absorption edges of constituent magnetic elements. The counterpart orthogonal states of the linear as well as circular modes can be rapidly switched simply by reversing oppositely the orientation of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetizations.</b> These results suggest that the orthogonal polarization states of the circular- and linear-polarization modes converted from such a polarizing optical element through reflection can be practically used in probing the vector quantities of element specific magnetizations in multicomponent magnetic materials. open 2...|$|R
50|$|Studies of solids by NMR {{relaxation}} {{experiments are}} special issues {{based on the}} following general statements. The experimental decay of macroscopic transverse or <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetization</b> follows the exponential law for complete domination of the spin-diffusion mechanism and a single relaxation time characterizes all of the nuclei in rigid solids, even {{those that are not}} chemically or structurally equivalent. The spin-diffusion mechanism is typical of systems with nuclei experiencing strong dipolar interactions (protons, fluorine or phosphorus nuclei at relatively small concentrations of paramagnetic centers). For other nuclei with weak dipolar coupling and/or at high concentration of paramagnetic centers, relaxation can be non-exponential following a stretched exponential function, exp(-(τ/T1)β) or exp(-(τ/T2)β). For paramagnetic solids, the β value of 0.5 corresponds to relaxation via direct electron-nucleus dipolar interactions without spin diffusion, while intermediate values between 0.5 and 1.0 can be attributed to a diffusion-limited mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|Positron Emission Tomography (PET), was {{the most}} {{frequently}} used brain mapping technique before the development of fMRI. There are a number of advantages that are presented in comparison to PET. According to D’Esposito, they include that fMRI “does not require an injection of radioisotope into participants and is otherwise noninvasive, has better spatial resolution, and has better temporal resolution." [...] The first MRI studies employed the use of “exogenous paramagnetic tracers to map changes in cerebral blood volume”, which allowed for the assessment of brain activity over several minutes. This changed with two advancements to MRI, the rapidness of MRI techniques were increased to 1.5 Tesla {{by the end of the}} 1980s, which provided a 2-d image. Next, endogenous contrast mechanisms were discovered by Detre, Koretsky, and colleagues was based on the net <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetization</b> within an organ, and a “second based on changes in the magnetic susceptibility induced by changing net tissue deoxyhemoglobin content”, which has been labeled BOLD contrast by Siege Ogawa. These discoveries served as inspiration for future brain mapping advancements. This allowed researchers to develop more complex types of experiments, going beyond observing the effects of single types of trials. When fMRI was developed one of its major limitations was the inability to randomize trials, but the event related fMRI fixed this problem. Cognitive subtraction was also an issue, which tried to correlate cognitive-behavioral differences between tasks with brain activity by pairing two tasks that are assumed to be matched perfectly for every sensory, motor, and cognitive process except the one of interest. Next, a push for the improvement of temporal resolution of fMRI studies led to the development of event-related designs, which according to Peterson, was inherited from ERP research in electrophysiology, but it was discovered that this averaging did not apply very well to the hemodynamic response because the response from trials could overlap. As a result, random jittering of the events was applied, which meant that the time repetition was varied and randomized for the trials in order to ensure that the activation signals did not overlap.|$|E

Here, we define the longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields as the field components parallel and perpendicular to the tape axis, respectively. If the filament-bundle is twisted, it can couple to the AC longitudinal magnetic field to generate the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetization</b> loss. Furthermore, the AC transport current flowing spirally in the twisted filament-bundle possibly influences the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetization.</b> The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetization</b> loss was measured in a twisted multifilamentary Bi 2223 tape exposed to longitudinal magnetic field and carrying the transport current. The measured <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetization</b> loss in the twisted tape exposed to the longitudinal magnetic field is larger than that in another untwisted tape. Supplying the AC transport current changes the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetization</b> loss in the twisted tape exposed to the AC longitudinal magnetic field. The influence of the transport current depends on the phase relation between the longitudinal magnetic field and the transport current. If their phase difference is 0 °, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetization</b> loss decreases remarkably with increasing amplitude of the transport current. It means that the change in the current distribution due to the transport current results in the decrease in the power flow from the magnet power supply.
