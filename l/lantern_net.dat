40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare different aquaculture systems and seed densities for the nursery phase of Crassostrea gigas  in Brazil. Small oyster seeds (2 mm in height) reared in three nursery systems (same area/floor), a <b>lantern</b> <b>net,</b> a bouncing bucket or a floating box were compared with three initial stocking densities (50, 100 and 200 mL of seeds/system floor). As density increased, there was a significant decline in seed growth and yield, mainly in the lantern nets (P= 0. 0002). Better yields were observed in the box (P= 0. 005) and bucket systems (P= 0. 02) under densities of 50 and 100 mL. However, at the highest density, the nursery box system had the highest seed yield when compared to the <b>lantern</b> <b>net</b> and bucket systems (P= 0. 003). The results showed that the floating box was the most efficient system tested with a survival of 54 % at a density of 100 mL. This was more than twice the survival for the same volumes used in the nursery lantern nets (24 %), which was the most common culture method in Brazil prior to this experiment (2002). An additional advantage is the reduced cost of starting with 2. 0 mm seeds that cost 50 % less than the usual 4. 0 to 8. 0 mm seeds. These results showed the efficiency of the floating box system, which is currently used by over 90 % of oyster producers in Brazil. </span...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} was {{developed at the}} marine farm of the São Paulo State Fisheries Institute in Ubatuba, SP, Brazil, aiming to compare the efficiency of three organisms (the sea urchins Echinometra lucunter, Lytechinus variegatus and the gastropod Tegula viridula) in controlling fouling incrustation in <b>lantern</b> <b>net</b> and on Nodipecten nodosus valves. Scallops measuring 32. 6 + 4. 9 mm of initial height were cultivated in eight Japanese lanterns with five floors each, at a density of 25 scallops/floor, according to the following delineament: T 1 – control (scallops alone); T 2 – scallops with E. lucunter; T 3 – scallops with L. variegatus; T 4 – scallops with T. viridula. Densities of the bio-controllers were: four (E. lucunter), three (L. variegatus) and 15 animals/floor (T. viridula). The {{experiment was}} finished 150 days later and the remaining fouling in the lanterns and on the scallops valves was removed and weighed (dry weights). The sea-urchin species E. lucunter and L. variegatus were significantly more efficient in removing the lantern fouling (86 % and 59 % relative to the control treatment respectively, {{but there were no}} significant differences among the biocontrollers in controlling the fouling on the scallop valves. These results suggest that biological control can be helpful as an auxiliary method in scallop culture fouling removal...|$|E
40|$|Suspended {{culture is}} a {{widespread}} farming method used for many bivalve species such as mussels, oysters and scallops. In the Mediterranean, this technique is mainly practised in lagoons or in sheltered coastal areas using floating lines from which molluscs are suspended in several ways. In this study, the European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis Linné, 1758) was grown in suspended lantern nets in the Calich lagoon (Sardinia, Mediterranean Sea) from March 2004 to March 2005. Two distinct groups of 6 lanterns each were hung to longline ropes near the mouth (station 1) and in the central portion of the lagoon (station 2). In each lantern (diameter= 50 cm; height= 30 cm), 90 O. edulis specimens were grown and, {{in order to ensure}} good water circulation inside the <b>lantern</b> <b>net,</b> fouling organisms were removed every month. Overall mortality, shell length (anterior-posterior axis), shell width (maximum distance on the lateral axis, between both valves of the closed shell) and total wet weight of a 180 specimen oyster sample (30 from each lantern) were recorded every 2 months at each site. In addition, water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH were monitored monthly by means of a multi-parametric probe at both sites (between 10 a. m. and 12 p. m.). One-way ANOVA was used to test for differences in oyster final mean morphometric characters recorded at the 2 growing stations. Chi-square test (with Yates correction for continuity) was performed to compare survival rates {{at the end of the}} trial. From an initial mean shell length of 49. 5 ± 4. 6 mm, O. edulis growth rate showed a similar trend at both the stations. Nevertheless, ANOVA detected significant differences (F= 7. 10; p< 0. 01) in final mean oyster length values (83. 7 ± 6. 5 mm at station 1 vs 81. 7 ± 7. 6 mm at station 2). Significant differences (F= 9. 74; p< 0. 01) were also found in final mean oyster width (28. 4 ± 3. 1 mm at station 1 vs 27. 5 ± 2. 8 mm at station 2) and weight (F= 4. 00; p< 0. 05) values (91. 4 ± 16. 7 g at station 1 vs 87. 7 ± 18. 3 g at station 2). Moreover, chi-square test revealed a significantly different survival rate (χ 2 = 10. 04; p< 0. 01) between the 2 groups (57. 4...|$|E
50|$|<b>Lantern</b> <b>nets</b> {{were first}} {{developed}} in Japan {{and are the}} most common method of growing out scallops following removal of juveniles from pearl nets. They allow the scallops to grow to adulthood for harvest due to their larger size and more sturdy construction. <b>Lantern</b> <b>nets</b> are employed in a similar fashion in the mid-water column and can be utilized in relatively high densities. Flow rate of water and algae is adequate and scallops will usually congregate {{around the edges of the}} circular net to maximise their food intake.|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{growth and}} survival of juvenile blacklip pearl oysters (Pinctada margaritifera) {{in a number of}} intermediate culture systems: <b>lantern</b> <b>nets,</b> panel nets, perforated plastic trays, and attached to ropes enclosed by mesh, Juveniles with initial dorsoventral measurements of 8. 3 to 51. 5 -mm increased in size by 20. 4 to 24. 8 -mm in 3 months, and 30. 7 to 36. 5 -mm in 5 months. Growth rates of juvenile P. margaritifera cultured in the open reef systems of the Solomon Islands compared favorably with those reported from the established pearl culture operations in French Polynesia and the Cook Islands. Initial experiments showed that survival of oysters in <b>lantern</b> <b>nets</b> in shallow reef areas was poor as a result of predation by fish and invertebrates. Siting of culture systems in deeper water decreased mortality by fish, although predation by invertebrates that recruited from plankton was still a potential problem. In general, {{there were no significant differences}} in growth or survival between juveniles held in <b>lantern</b> <b>nets</b> and panel nets; however, <b>lantern</b> <b>nets</b> were more difficult to clean and inspect for predators. Juvenile {{growth and survival}} did not differ significantly (p >. 05) between panel nets and trays after 5 months, although the rigid trays were easier to clean of fouling organisms. Juveniles placed loosely into trays tended to aggregate, and rates of growth and survival of oysters glued separately into trays were significantly greater (p <. 05) than those for oysters placed loosely into trays. There was no significant difference in growth between oysters glued into trays and those glued onto ropes and enclosed behind plastic mesh. Overall, this study shows that important criteria of the growout units needed for the intermediate culture of P. margaritifera in the Western Pacific include ease of cleaning and access for regular inspection and removal of predators...|$|R

40|$|One-year old rope grown mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis L.) {{were held}} in three {{experimental}} <b>lantern</b> <b>nets</b> in raft system outside of Sinop Harbour. Mortality and growth were monitored from May 2005 to May 2006. Water temperature, salinity, transparency and food availability (total particulate matter, particulate organic matter, particulate inorgnic matter and Chlorophyll-a) were also determined. The monthly specific growth rate (SGR%) ranged 1. 50 - 5. 72 % {{with a mean of}} 2. 59 ± 0. 30 %. Shell length increment was found as 13. 67 mm and reached to 51. 20 ± 0. 50 mm.

50|$|Ear hanging {{methods were}} {{developed}} to be a cheaper alternative to <b>lantern</b> <b>nets.</b> Subsequently, {{research has shown that}} growth of ear-hung scallops can also be higher than those in <b>lantern</b> <b>nets.</b> Ear hanging involves drilling a hole in the scallop ear (the protruding margin of shell near where the two shells join) and attaching it to a fixed submerged line for growth. Such a process can be relatively labor-intensive as each scallop must be individually handled and drilled (however, many operations now have machines for this process). Furthermore, high mortality rates can result from drilling if scallops are too small, are drilled incorrectly, or spend too much time out of water and become physiologically stressed. This has resulted in research being conducted into the optimal drilling size. This size {{has been shown to be}} species specific with small species not having good survival rates. As such, ear hanging is an effective method of growing out larger scallop species. If ear hanging is an appropriate method, scallops can be densely stocked in pairs on lines with as little as 100 mm between pairs. Scallops are maintained in this fashion until harvest. A variety of attachment products are constantly being tested with the best growth so far being obtained with a fastener called a securatie.|$|R

40|$|Following the {{discovery}} in 1978 {{of large numbers}} of escallops in the North Water of Mulroy Bay, a detailed study of stocks was made in 1979. Spat settled out at shell height 190 to 220 µm from late July to 9 August, greatest density was 1, 390 spat per metre of 12 mm diameter blue polypropylene rope. Mean daily growth rates from August to mid October ranged from 196. 6 µm failing to 17. 5 µm from mid October to December. Greatest densities of adult escallops occurred near rocks at depths from 3 to 15 m. Age frequency determinations showed that settlement had occurred every year since 1967.

40|$|Abstract: One-year old rope grown mussels (Mytilus edulis L.) {{were held}} in {{experimental}} <b>lantern</b> <b>nets</b> at 2 m and 6 m depths in Loch Kishorn {{on the west coast}} of Scotland. Growth, mortality and shell morphology were monitored from May 1993 to August 1994. Water temperature, salinity, transparency and food availability were also determined. These showed a clear seasonal cycle, in consequence, growth of mussels was relatively rapid from May to November and very slow {{during the rest of the}} year. Depth had a insignificant effect on shell length and tissue growth (P> 0. 05) due to similar environmental factors. Shell length growth and tissue growth exhibited different seasonal patterns and mussels reached marketable size of 50 mm over 2 years old. Shell morphology was similar at both depths (P> 0. 05) while shell weight was significantly higher at 2 m than 6 m (P 0. 05). Most of the mortalities were occurred just after stocking and attributed to stress due to handling of mussels...|$|R
40|$|Three mussel groups differing in mean multilocus {{heterozygosity}} (MLH) {{were used}} to examine the MLH-fitness relationship. Mussels were submitted to aerobic and anaerobic stressful conditions in the laboratory, and their LT 50 was measured. Mor-tality was not random in two of the three groups and affected the homozygous individuals more. This selective mortality caused {{a significant increase in the}} mean MLH of the survivors, but only for the two groups characterized by the lowest initial MLH and significant deficits in heterozygotes at the onset of the experiments. While these experiments were ongoing, the same two groups also suffered a 40 % mor-tality rate in <b>lantern</b> <b>nets</b> under field conditions. This mortality also increased the mean MLH in survivors. All groups showed strong inverse relationships between MLH and standard metabolism. Our results suggest that the higher resistance of more heterozygous individuals is related to their lower metabolic needs.

40|$|Growth, mortality, production, spat collection, {{seasonal}} {{cycles of}} condition index, biochemical composition, carrying capacity of commercial raft culture systems and population genetic characteristics of blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) were studied at different sites in Loch Etive and Loch Kishorn {{on the west}} coast of Scotland between May 1993 and May 1995. The main objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate current suspended mussel culture production in raft systems and to obtain basic information on the biology and the genetic structure of the two mussel populations in the lochs. There were some water quality differences between the sites in relation to seston, salinity and transparency but not to temperature, particulate organic matter and chlorophylla. When food is available (as particulate organic matter and chlorophyll-a), there was a clear seasonal cycle in mussel somatic growth and shell growth. Mussel growth was relatively high from mid-spring until late autumn, but very slow during the rest of the year. The spring-summer period of rapid shell length and somatic growth coincided with relatively optimum environmental conditions and positive relationships were indicated between growth rates, temperature and salinity, indicating the limiting effect of these two primary factors on growth from late-autumn to mid-spring when there is also a lack of available food. Mussel growth was higher at 2 m depth on the raft-rope systems, but in <b>lantern</b> <b>nets</b> experimental growth did not show differences between depths. Growth was found to be similar in the <b>lantern</b> <b>nets</b> and on culture ropes in the two lochs in the first year of experiments (from May 1993 to May 1994). Overall, mean length increments were 31. 01 mm in Loch Etive and 28. 75 mm in Loch Kishorn over a 15 month period. The mussels reached marketable size (> 50 mm) in two years from the known time of spat settlement. A cross-transplantation experiment showed that site rather than stock is the main factor explaining differences in mussel growth in Loch Etive and Loch Kishorn. The position of the mussels within a raft has a significant effect on their growth; mussels at the inflow of a raft have a better growth than those near the outflow (p< 0. 05) due to greater availability of food. Mean mussel biomass was higher in Loch Kishorn while production was higher in Loch Etive, but there were seasonal and monthly fluctuations in both biomass and production at both sites. Biochemical composition and energy content were similar in both sites, while mussel meat yield and condition indices were significantly higher in Loch Kishom than Loch Etive. Meat content, condition index and carbohydrate values were high during the summer and low from autumn to spring, reaching minimum values in March and April at the time of spawning. Spat settlement occurred in June-July in Loch Etive and June-December in Loch Kishorn. Sea squirt, starfish and eider duck are problems effecting spat collection at the Loch Kishorn site, whereas spat collection in Loch Etive is unaffected by these pests/predators. The carrying capacities for cultured mussels were found to be about 24 metric tons per raft for Loch Etive and 38 metric tons per raft for Loch Kishorn using a particulate organic matter based model; these are reasonable estimates in comparison to the known mussel production levels reported by producers. However, a seston-based model gave an overestimate of carrying capacity for both sites. Cross-transplantation of mussels, electrophoresis and shell morphological measurements showed significant differences between the Loch Etive and Loch Kishorn mussel populations. Mortality rates were higher in transplanted mussels than in the native mussels (p< 0. 001) ...|$|R

40|$|Survival, {{growth and}} immune {{response}} of the scallop, Chlamys farreri, cultured in <b>lantern</b> <b>nets</b> at five different depths (2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 m below the sea surface) were studied in Haizhou Bay during the hot season (summer and autumn) of 2007. Survival and growth rates were quantified bimonthly. Immune activities in hemolymph (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and acid phosphatase (ACP)) were measured to evaluate the health of scallops {{at the end of}} the study. Environmental parameters at the five depths were also monitored during the experiment. Mortalities mainly occurred during summer. Survival of scallops suspended at 15 m (78. 0 %) and 20 m (86. 7 %) was significantly higher than at 2 m (62. 9 %), 5 m (60. 8 %) or 10 m (66. 8 %) {{at the end of the}} study. Mean shell height grew significantly faster at 10 m (205. 0 mu m/d) and 20 m (236. 9 mu m/d) than at 2, 5 or 15 m in summer (July 9 to September 1); however, shell growth rate at 20 m was significantly lower than at the other four depths in autumn (September 2 to November 6). In contrast to summer, scallops at 5 m grew faster (262. 9 mu m/d) during autumn. The growth of soft tissue at different depths showed a similar trend to the shell. Growth rates of shell height and soft tissue were faster in autumn than in summer, with the exception of shell height at 20 m. SOD activity of scallops increased with depth, and ACP activity was significantly higher at 15 and 20 m than at other depths, which suggests that scallops were healthier near the bottom. Factors explaining the depth-related mortality and growth of scallops are also discussed. We conclude that the mass mortality of scallop, C. farreri, during summer can be prevented by moving the culture area to deeper water and yield can be maximized by suspending the scallops in deep water during summer and then transferring them to shallow water in autumn...|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, hatchery-growout {{culture of}} oysters, Crassostrea virginica, and {{northern}} quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria, has been commercially successful in Atlantic United States and oysters in Atlantic Canada. Culturists {{have not had}} success, as yet, with northern bay scallops, Argopecten irradians irradians. Large mortalities occur during the culture process, mainly because the scallops are relatively delicate and some die when handled. In addition, too little edible meat, i. e. the adductor muscle, is produced for the culture operation to be profitable. However, three companies, one in Massachusetts, one in New Brunswick, and one on Prince Edward Island, Canada, have discovered that they can produce bay scallops successfully by harvesting them when partially-to fully-grown and selling them whole. In restaurants, the scallops are cooked and served with all their meats (adductor muscles and rims) and also with the shells, which have been genetically-bred for bright colors.

40|$|Growth. mortality. production. {{physiology}} and seasonal cycles of condition index and proximate biochemical composition of experimental populations of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis L.) were studied at different sites in Loch Etive and Loch Leven on the West coast of Scotland between May 1990 and September 1992. The main {{objective of the}} study was to evaluate current suspended mussel culture practices and to establish the basis for their possible integrated cultivation with salmon cage fanning. In addition. a preliminary investigation on employment of the. Charm IT' system as a rapid method for detecting residues of drugs used for treating cultured salmon in the tissues of mussels was carried out. There were some differences between sites in salinity, seston and particulate organic matter, but not in chlorophyll-a. Food availability (as particulate organic matter and chlorophyll-a) showed a clear seasonal cycle and in consequence growth of mussels were relatively rapid from late-spring until mid-autumn (g 6 months) and very slow or absent during the rest of the year. This period of rapid length and tissue growth coincided with relatively optimum environmental conditions and there were apparent positive relationships between monthly growth rates and temperature and chlorophyll-a values, indicating the limiting effect of these two primary factors on growth during autumn-winter and even in early spring. Almost all growth parameters examined were showed significant differences between the lochs. Growth performance of both native and transplanted mussels in Loch Leven was quite poor. Overall annual length increments were 25. 1 - 25. 9 mm at sites in Loch Etive and Dunstaffnage Bay, but 20. 1 - 22. 8 mm in Loch Leven. A crosstransplantation experiment showed that site rather than stock is the main reason for differences in growth parameters between Lochs Etive and Leven. These observed growth differences between sites and stocks were also confirmed by physiological measurements and estimated growth potential or scope for growth. Growth of mussels at salmon farms was faster than at neighbouring mussel farms during two annual experiments, but only meat weight at one salmon farm during experiment I, and length and live weight at the salmon farm in Loch Etive as well as all growth parameters at the salmon fann in Loch Leven during experiment II were significantly greater (>sO. 05). These differences were most likely a result of high particulate organic matter levels at salmon fanns. Similar to growth, biomass and production, the condition index and biochemical composition of mussels showed a clear seasonal cycle. Meat content, condition index and glycogen values were high during summer, started to decline in late autumn and reached minimum values in April before showing maximum increases in May. This reflects the typical storage and reproductive cycle of mussels in Northern Europe: accumulation of reserves during summer and their utilization during winter and early spring as energy resources for metabolism and reproduction. This cycle clearly showed that the main spawning of mussels on the West coast of Scotland occurred during March-May, and primary spat settlement from June to August. Heavy losses occurred from French socks, causing substantial amounts of eliminated biomass during experiment I, but when these fall outs were eliminated during experiment II by using <b>lantern</b> <b>nets,</b> it was clear that natural mortality rates were quite low and similar at all sites. Apart from growth characteristics and physiological responses, there were persistent morphological differences between the Loch Etive and Loch Leven populations. Cross-transplantation and physiological measurements after various acclimatization periods showed that, while morphological differences might be related to genetic origin, all other differences between the two popUlations are governed by environmental factors. The practical implications of these findings for developing suspended mussel culture on the West coast of Scotland and the possibility of a simple integrated salmon-mussel fanning system, which could be effective in controlling potential eutrophication from intensive salmon cage fanning and the removing large amounts of organic matter by mussels leading alterations in ecosystem, are discussed. A preliminary study with the Chann II Test has showed that the system is not so appropriate method as expected for screening mussel tissue sampled straight from the field, since mussel tissues require purification due to interference from bacteria or microbial detritus, before screening...|$|R
