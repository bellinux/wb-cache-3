Originally ATHEMOO was designed so that all of the online open areas looked like a Hotel Lobby. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time of ATHEMOOs establishment there were over 2200 members of ATHE, half of which were earning under $20,000 a year; it was therefore decided <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ATHE</b> conference in 1993 that ATHEMOO would be created to help all members discuss and learn from <b>the</b> <b>ATHE</b> conferences.|$|R

Consequently, it <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> specific problems that face just war theory in an {{asymmetric warfare}} context, by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> three parts of just war theory. The first is jus ad bellum, {{the justice of}} war, and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{decision to go to}} war. The second is jus in bello, the justice in war, and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> conduct of war. The final is jus post bellum, and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> conclusion of war. By the end of this thesis, I aim to have provided a basis for reconciling asymmetric warfare and just war theory. Department of Government and International Relation...|$|R
