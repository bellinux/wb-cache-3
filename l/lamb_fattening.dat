It was the aim of our study to investigate whether the transmitter content of intrinsic nerves changes with the developmental stage. The neurochemical code of myenteric neurons in the rumen from suckling <b>lambs,</b> <b>fattened</b> <b>lambs</b> and adult sheep was determined by using quadruple immunohistochemistry against choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Three neurochemically distinct subpopulations were identified within the rumen. They expressed the code ChAT/–, ChAT/SP and NOS/VIP. The number of ChAT/SP neurons did not change during development. It was 62 % in the newborn lamb and remained stable in <b>fattened</b> <b>lambs</b> (63 %) and adult sheep (63 %). By contrast, the number of ChAT/– neurons decreased significantly from 20 % in suckling lambs to 11 % and 7 % in <b>fattened</b> <b>lambs</b> and adult sheep, respectively. Simultaneously, the proportion of NOS/VIP neurons increased from 16 % in suckling lambs to 29 % in adult sheep.

40|$|A {{community-based}} {{sheep breeding}} {{program has been}} implemented in the highlands of Ethiopia to improve the body weight and reproductive performance of Menz sheep. This study adopts system dynamic methodology to develop a dynamic stochastic simulation herd model to evaluate the effect of genetic improvement and additional feed sources (forage production) on herd dynamics and profitability. The study also explores the opportunities of system dynamics approach {{in the context of}} designing breeding programs to predict annual genetic gain of traits. Historical data of monthly rainfall for a period of 10 years and 4 years of monthly temperature data were used. Sheep performance data were available from the herd-book of the community-based sheep breeding program. Additional input data were sourced from questionnaires, observation, literature and expert knowledge. The simulation model consists of three sub-models: vegetation growth and dynamics, herd structure and dynamics and economic analysis. The length of the time horizon was 240 months (20 years). The first 120 months served as a baseline scenario, where the fattening of culled breeding rams was practiced. For the second 120 months genetic selection of body weight was introduced considering two scenarios: culled ram and <b>lamb</b> <b>fattening.</b> For the prediction of genetic gain genetic selection for six month weight, pre-weaning survival and fertility rate was introduced from the initial stage of the simulation. Results from the model showed a gradual decrease in sheep population size while body weight of the animals improved. The model keeps heavier animals in smaller flocks to match the herd nutritional demand with the available resources. The simulation also demonstrates that breeding for heavier body weight was considerably more profitable than the baseline scenario; and <b>lamb</b> <b>fattening</b> was more profitable than culled ram fattening, which is the current practice. Smallholder farmers can gain more income by fattening young lambs due to a decrease of production (health, housing and labour) and feed costs compared to fattening of culled breeding ram. A reasonable annual genetic gain, rate of inbreeding and profit per ewe per year were predicted when community based breeding is performed. System dynamics modelling is a valuable tool to describe breeding programs by building a simple, flexible and usage driven simulation model. Results of the simulations were discussed on site with smallholder farmers and they are willing to reduce flock size in order to have healthy, fast growing animals. Further development and evaluation of the model is needed which shall lead to further refinement. This shall eventually aid in the further evaluation of genetic selection in the Menz sheep population, helping smallholder farmers to increase income...|$|E

Lambs of the C group were fed on mixture with crude forages, those from the E I on mixture with roasted cereals and lambs of the E II on mixture with both roasted cereals and soybean. The lambs from E I and E II groups grew faster (by 13. 62 and 19. 40 %), gained higher final body weight (by 6. 72 and 8. 08 %) and spent less food per kg of daily gain weights (by 14. 03 and 13. 24 %) although feed consumption in E I was lower (by 2. 33 %) but in E II higher (3. 49 %) {{in comparison with the}} C group. The blood serum concentrations of cholesterol-total and cholesterol-HDL were lower for lambs EI groups compared with lambs C and E II groups.

These observations are accepted {{as a result of}} work done by several researchers at different experiment stations. None of these investigations made a complete analysis of the carcass; therefore this project was designed to procure additional information regarding the influence of stilbestrol upon the quality and palatability of the carcass...|$|R
40|$|Fermenters {{are widely}} used to study ruminal fermentation, but {{information}} on microbial populations developing in fermenters over the incubation period is limited. Four Rusitec fermenters were fed 2 diets representative of those administered to dairy sheep(DAI; 50 : 50 alfalfa hay:concentrate) and <b>fattening</b> <b>lambs</b> (FAT; 15 : 85 barley straw:concentrate) in a crossover design with 2 14 -d incubation periods to assess {{the evolution of the}} microbial populations. There were 4 fermenters per diet...|$|R
40|$|Cylactin® {{consists}} of dehydrated cells of {{a strain of}} Enterococcus faecium. It is authorised for use in feeds for chickens, turkeys and pigs for fattening, piglets, sows, calves and cats and dogs. The applicant is now seeking re-evaluation when used with calves and a new authorisation for use in feed for goat kids and lambs for rearing and for fattening at 1. 0 x 109 - 6. 6 x 109 CFU/kg feed. The strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics, except for kanamycin which is considered of no concern. There were no adverse effects seen in calves when Cylactin® was administered at a 100 -fold overdose. Consequently, Cylactin® is considered safe for calves for fattening and for rearing at the recommended dose. This conclusion was extended to kids for fattening and rearing. However, <b>lambs</b> for <b>fattening</b> are not considered a minor species and require a separate demonstration of safety which was not provided. No additional concerns would arise for consumers, users and the environment from the proposed extension of use. Seven trials made with calves for fattening or rearing were considered. Use of the additive with calves for fattening significantly increased final body weight and/or daily gain in four of five trials when used at a dose of 1 x 109 CFU/kg complete feed. An additional study with calves for rearing confirmed these results at the same dose. As the mechanism of action of the additive can be reasonably assumed to be same, the positive results seen in calves for fattening and rearing can be extrapolated to kids for rearing and fattening. Conclusions on {{the efficacy of the}} product for sheep would derive from results with <b>lambs</b> for <b>fattening</b> which were not made available...|$|R
40|$|Title of the paper: Effect of {{intensive}} group condition and {{sex on the}} oral stereotypes and some behaviour traits in <b>fattening</b> <b>lambs</b> Oral stereotypes {{are a kind of}} the forms of behavioural abnormalities and many husbandry factors can cause the development of such behaviours in almost all domestic species. In this study, effects of housing based on group condition and also sex differences on the development of oral stereotypes were investigated in <b>fattening</b> <b>lambs</b> Ten male and ten female Turkgeldi synthetic breed of lambs were used. Animals were assigned to sex groups {{at the beginning of the}} study and housed in pens that consisted of metal feed through and water buckets on a straw bedded floor during the experiment. Behavioural observations were taken by two observer and time sampling technique was- used. Activities such as biting, licking and chewing of through, water bucket and also bars of pen were recorded as oral stereotypes. Generally, it was indicated that intensive group condition in <b>fattening</b> <b>lamb.</b> causes the development of behavioural abnormalities related to nutritional origin. Activities towards the bedding material, standing, lying and wool chewing behaviours were significantly affected by sex. The male lambs showed more activities in standing and wool licking and wool chewing behaviours than the females while the lying and activity towards the bedding material observed more frequently in the female group. This finding indicated that general activity was high in the male lambs. There was no significant sex effect on the total oral stereotypes. It was concluded that lack of structural materials have an important role in the development of oral stereotypes. In addition some stressful conditions that caused by group housing may also resulted in the development of such abnormalities especially for the male lambs...|$|R
