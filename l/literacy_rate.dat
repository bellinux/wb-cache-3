50|$|As seen in {{the table}} below, <b>literacy</b> <b>rates</b> are much higher for urban women than rural women. <b>Literacy</b> <b>rates</b> {{decrease}} as age increases for both genders because more Nepali youth are attending school today than in the decade prior. However, regardless of geographic location or age group, men have higher <b>literacy</b> <b>rates</b> than women. Although <b>literacy</b> <b>rates</b> are increasing, men's <b>literacy</b> <b>rates</b> are still higher than women's due to unequal access to formal education and enrollment in schooling.|$|R

40|$|Women {{and girl}} {{children}} spend considerable time to collect water {{for meeting the}} domestic needs of the households in rural areas of many developing countries. Thus, scarcity of water can have disproportionate effect on the welfare of women and girl children. In this paper, I use data from villages in India to examine whether access to water affects literacy among women. I find that <b>literacy</b> <b>rates</b> are almost 5 percent higher for women in villages with access to water, whereas {{there is no difference}} in the <b>literacy</b> <b>rates</b> of men. I also examine the effect of distance to the source and the type of source of drinking water on <b>literacy</b> <b>rates.</b> Female <b>literacy</b> <b>rates</b> decrease as the distance to the source increases. Sources that require more time to collect water such as manual wells and rivers have a negative and significant effect on women’s <b>literacy</b> <b>rates.</b> These patterns suggest that longer hours spent on collecting water impact <b>literacy</b> <b>rates</b> of women...|$|R

40|$|This article {{makes an}} attempt to analyze the {{progress}} of <b>literacy</b> <b>rates</b> across districts in Karnataka. Co-efficient of Variation is used to indicate the inter-district variations with regard to <b>literacy</b> <b>rates.</b> The analysis reveals that the female literacy has seen a positive gain to that of male <b>literacy</b> <b>rates</b> over the period 2001 - 2011. No doubt the percentage of regional and gender gap across districts over the period 2001 - 2011 has reduced, but the percentage of reduction is lesser. The inter-district variations in terms of gender and regional perspectives have seen a decline over the period 2001 - 2011.
