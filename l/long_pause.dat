Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the beam}} intensities at superheavy element {{facilities}} result in about 1012 projectiles hitting the target per second; this cannot be increased without burning {{the target and}} the detector, and producing larger amounts of the increasingly unstable actinides needed for the target is impractical. The team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna is building a new superheavy element factory (SHE-factory) with improved detectors {{and the ability to}} work on a smaller scale, but even so continuing beyond element 120 and perhaps 121 would be a great challenge. Krzysztof Rykaczewski, a professor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory which collaborates with Dubna on superheavy elements, has nevertheless predicted that in one generation element 124 would be reached. Chemist, writer, and philosopher of science Eric Scerri has noted that the development of new technologies in the field has been driven by the quest for new elements, so that the inability to proceed beyond elements 120 and 121 with current technologies may not necessarily cause a very <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> in new discoveries.|$|E

5|$|The 1804 Antigua–Charleston {{hurricane}} {{was first}} sighted on 3September as it swept past Saint Barthélemy, Saint Kitts, and Antigua, drifting toward the west-northwest and soon approaching Puerto Rico and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The storm reached the Bahamas while turning northward on 4September, nearing the northern Floridan coast by 6September. It remained offshore on 7September, gradually approaching the coast throughout the day, and eventually made landfall that evening along {{the coasts of}} Georgia and South Carolina. Observations in Savannah, Georgia, indicated north-to-northeast winds throughout 8September, though other reports recorded northeast-to-easterly gusts; at Charleston, South Carolina, however, winds, initially northeast-to-east, curved southeastward later in the storm. Little information exists on the hurricane's whereabouts between North Carolina and New England, with a single report at Norfolk, Virginia of east-northeasterly winds veering east-to-east-southeast from 7to 9September, suggesting the disturbance's passage west of there. A severe gale arrived in New England on 11and 12September, though the <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> between {{the departure of the}} hurricane from the Carolinas and its arrival in the northeastern United States evidences the possibility that the two systems may have been unrelated.|$|E

40|$|Minimizing pauses in chest {{compressions}} during {{cardiopulmonary resuscitation}} is {{a focus of}} current guidelines. Prior analyses found that prolonged pauses for defibrillation (perishock pauses) are associated with worse survival. We analyzed resuscitations to characterize the association between pauses for all reasons and both ventricular fibrillation termination and patient survival. In 319 patients with ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we analyzed recordings from all defibrillators used during resuscitation and measured durations of all cardiopulmonary resuscitation pauses. Median durations were 32 seconds (25 th and 75 th percentile, 22 and 52 seconds) for the <b>longest</b> <b>pause</b> for any reason, 23 seconds (25 th and 75 th percentile, 14 and 34 seconds) for the <b>longest</b> perishock <b>pause,</b> and 24 seconds (25 th and 75 th percentile, 11 and 38 seconds) for the <b>longest</b> nonshock <b>pause.</b> Multivariable regression models showed lower odds for survival per 5 -second increase in the <b>longest</b> overall <b>pause</b> (odds ratio, 0. 89; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 83 - 0. 95), <b>longest</b> perishock <b>pause</b> (odds ratio, 0. 85; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 77 - 0. 93), and <b>longest</b> nonshock <b>pause</b> (odds ratio, 0. 83; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 75 - 0. 91). In 36 % of cases, the <b>longest</b> <b>pause</b> was a nonshock pause; this subgroup had lower survival than the group in whom the <b>longest</b> <b>pause</b> was a perishock pause (27 % versus 44 %, respectively; P < 0. 01) despite a higher chest compression fraction. Preshock pauses were 8 seconds (25 th and 75 th percentile, 4 and 17 seconds) for shocks that terminated ventricular fibrillation and 7 seconds (25 th and 75 th percentile, 4 and 13 seconds) for shocks that did not (P= 0. 18). Prolonged pauses have a negative association with survival not explained by chest compression fraction or decreased ventricular fibrillation termination rate.

40|$|A recent {{controversy}} has emerged concerning {{the existence of}} <b>long</b> <b>pauses,</b> presumably refl ecting bistability of membrane potential, in the cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC) of awake animals. It is generally agreed that in the anesthetized animals and in vitro, these cells switch between two stable membrane potential states: a depolarized state (the ‘up-state’) characterized by continuous fi ring of simple spikes (SS) and a hyperpolarized state (the ‘down-state’) characterized by <b>long</b> <b>pauses</b> in the SS activity. To address the existence of <b>long</b> <b>pauses</b> in the neural activity of cerebellar PCs in the awake and behaving animal we used extracellular recordings in cats and fi nd that {{approximately half of the}} recorded PCs exhibit such <b>long</b> <b>pauses</b> in the SS activity and transition between activity – periods with uninterrupted SS lasting an average of 1300 ms – and pauses up to several seconds. We called these cells pausing Purkinje cells (PPC) and they can easily be distinguished from continuous fi ring Purkinje cells. In most PPCs, state transitions in both directions were often associated (25 % of state transitions) with complex spikes (CSs). This is consistent with intracellular fi ndings of CS-driven state transitions. In sum, we present proof for the existence of <b>long</b> <b>pauses</b> in the PC SS activity that probably refl ect underlying bistability, provide the fi rst in-depth analysis of these pauses and show for the fi rst time that transitions in and out of these pauses are related to CS fi ring in the awake and behaving animal...|$|R

2500|$|Hughes {{had made}} {{numerous}} business partnerships through industrialist and producer, David Charnay. Their friendship and many partnerships began with The Conqueror film, which was first {{released to the}} public in 1956. The film caused many controversies due to the film's radioactive location in St. George, Utah that eventually led to Hughes buying up nearly every copy of the film he could, only to watch the film at home repeatedly for many nights in a row. Charnay later bought the Four Star film and television production company that produced The Conqueror. Hughes and Charnay’s most published dealings were with a contested AirWest LBO. Charnay led the LBO buyout group that involved Howard Hughes and their partners acquiring Air West. Hughes, Charnay, as well as three others were indicted. The complexity of this LBO was the first of its kind. The indictment, made by U.S. Attorney DeVoe Heaton, accused the group of conspiring to drive down the stock price of Air West in order to pressure company directors to sell to Hughes. The charges were dismissed after a judge had determined that the indictment had failed to allege an illegal action on the part of Hughes, Charnay, and all the other accused in the indictment. Thompson, the federal judge that made the decision to dismiss the charges called the indictment one of the worst claims that he had ever seen. The charges were filed again, a second time, by U.S. Attorney DeVoe Heaton's assistant, Dean Vernon. The Federal Judge ruled on November 13, 1974 and elaborated to say that the case suggested a [...] "reprehensible misuse of the power of great wealth" [...] and in his judicial opinion, [...] "no crime had been committed." [...] The aftermath of the Air West deal was later settled with the SEC by paying former stockholders for alleged losses from the sale of their investment in Air West stock.
