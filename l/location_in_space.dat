5|$|Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} the position of parts of the mouth. EMA uses sensor coils placed on the tongue {{and other parts of}} the mouth to measure their position and movement over time during speech and swallowing. Induction coils around the head produce an electromagnetic field that creates, or induces, a current in the sensors in the mouth. Because the current induced is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance, a computer is able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's <b>location</b> <b>in</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} air makes outer space an ideal {{location}} for astronomy at all wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. This {{is evidenced by the}} spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every <b>location</b> <b>in</b> <b>space</b> is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater {{on the far side of}} the Moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations.|$|E

25|$|Physiological {{noise is}} from head and brain {{movement}} in the scanner from breathing, heart beats, or the subject fidgeting, tensing, or making physical responses such as button presses.

Since fMRI is acquired in slices, after movement, a voxel continues {{to refer to the}} same absolute <b>location</b> <b>in</b> <b>space</b> while the neurons underneath it would have changed. Another source of physiological noise is the change in the rate of blood flow, blood volume, and use of oxygen over time. This last component contributes to two-thirds of physiological noise, which, in turn, is the main contributor to total noise.|$|E
25|$|The act {{of killing}} oneself is not {{applicable}} to an omnipotent being, since, despite {{that such an}} act does involve some power, it also involves a lack of power: the human person who can kill himself is already not indestructible, and, in fact, every agent constituting his environment is more powerful in some ways than himself. In other words, all non-omnipotent agents are concretely synthetic: constructed as contingencies of other, smaller, agents, meaning that they, unlike an omnipotent agent, logically can exist not only in multiple instantiation (by being constructed out of the more basic agents they are made of), but are each bound to a different <b>location</b> <b>in</b> <b>space</b> contra transcendent omnipresence.|$|E
25|$|Reflections can {{be divided}} into two types: {{specular}} reflection and diffuse reflection. Specular reflection describes the gloss of surfaces such as mirrors, which reflect light in a simple, predictable way. This allows for production of reflected images that can be associated with an actual (real) or extrapolated (virtual) <b>location</b> <b>in</b> <b>space.</b> Diffuse reflection describes non-glossy materials, such as paper or rock. The reflections from these surfaces can only be described statistically, with the exact distribution of the reflected light depending on the microscopic structure of the material. Many diffuse reflectors are described or can be approximated by Lambert's cosine law, which describes surfaces that have equal luminance when viewed from any angle. Glossy surfaces can give both specular and diffuse reflection.|$|E

25|$|Surprisingly, gauge {{symmetry}} {{can give}} a deeper explanation {{for the existence of}} interactions, such as the electric and nuclear interactions. This arises from a type of gauge symmetry relating to the fact that all particles of a given type are experimentally indistinguishable from one another. Imagine that Alice and Betty are identical twins, labeled at birth by bracelets reading A and B. Because the girls are identical, nobody would be able to tell if they had been switched at birth; the labels A and B are arbitrary, and can be interchanged. Such a permanent interchanging of their identities is like a global gauge symmetry. There is also a corresponding local gauge symmetry, which describes the fact that from one moment to the next, Alice and Betty could swap roles while nobody was looking, and nobody would be able to tell. If we observe that Mom's favorite vase is broken, we can only infer that the blame belongs to one twin or the other, but we cannot tell whether the blame is 100% Alice's and 0% Betty's, or vice versa. If Alice and Betty are in fact quantum-mechanical particles rather than people, then they also have wave properties, including the property of superposition, which allows waves to be added, subtracted, and mixed arbitrarily. It follows that we are not even restricted to complete swaps of identity. For example, if we observe that a certain amount of energy exists in a certain <b>location</b> <b>in</b> <b>space,</b> there is no experiment that can tell us whether that energy is 100% A's and 0% B's, 0% A's and 100% B's, or 20% A's and 80% B's, or some other mixture. The fact that the symmetry is local means that we cannot even count on these proportions to remain fixed as the particles propagate through space. The details of how this is represented mathematically depend on technical issues relating to the spins of the particles, but for our present purposes we consider a spinless particle, for which {{it turns out that the}} mixing can be specified by some arbitrary choice of gauge θ(x), where an angle θnbsp&=nbsp&0° represents 100% A and 0% B, θnbsp&=nbsp&90° means 0% A and 100% B, and intermediate angles represent mixtures.|$|E

This {{was the first time}} the spacecraft had done any major maneuvering since the Family Portrait photograph of the planets was taken in 1990.

40|$|Certain words (e. g., star, shoe) are implicitly {{associated}} with <b>locations</b> <b>in</b> <b>space</b> (e. g., up, down) and can bias visual attention toward those locations (e. g., hearing “bird” and looking up; Gozli, Pratt, Martin, 2 ̆ 6 Chasteen, 2016). Research often attributes these shifts in {{attention to the}} processing of associations between words and space, although a lack of research with infants has left the developmental origins of this phenomenon unexplored. Visual attention, measured through the Intermodal Preferential Looking Paradigm (IPLP), provides insight into infants’ cognitive processes (Golinkoff, Ma, Song 2 ̆ 6 Hirsh-Pasek, 2013). The current study analyzes 24 to 36 month old toddlers’ (8 boys, 7 girls) performance on a IPLP task with words implicitly {{associated with}} upper or lower <b>locations</b> <b>in</b> <b>space.</b> Of particular interest was whether the presentation of implicitly spatial words would cause shift in attention to upper and lower <b>locations</b> <b>in</b> anticipation of the referents’ at their typical <b>locations</b> <b>in</b> <b>space.</b> We further examine whether performance on the task is related with gender. Analyses found girls in our sample to make significantly more congruent shifts in attention to upper and lower locations following implicit spatial word processing than boys ?² (1, N = 33) = 4. 164, p 3 ̆c. 05.
