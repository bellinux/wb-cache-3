This thesis explores the labour market implications of a series of liberalising product market reforms initiated in India in the 1990 s. The analysis of Chapter 2 indicates that declines in input tariffs are associated with increased formal firm employment across all Indian states, while FDI reform is associated with increased (reduced) formal firm employment in states with flexible (inflexible) labour markets (1990 - 1997). The FDI effect holds for permanent employment in both groups of states but only affects casual (contract) employment to a significant extent in states with flexible labour markets. The evidence is supportive of the baseline results being driven by product market competition within the formal sector. Chapter 3 reveals that tariff liberalisation is not associated with significant changes in employment in informal enterprises, possibly because these enterprises rarely engage in international trade. However, on average and ceteris paribus, delicensing (FDI reform) is associated with statistically significant increases in informal employment and informal enterprise numbers in states with inflexible (flexible) labour markets (1990 - 2001). There is some evidence that the delicensing effect is attributable to increases in product market competition in delicensed industries in the post-reform period. The mechanism underlying the result associated with FDI liberalisation is more uncertain and could be one or a combination of competition and collaborative linkages between informal and formal manufacturers. Chapter 4 examines the impact of a post- 1996 policy reform (‘SSI dereservation’), which <b>liberalised</b> <b>product</b> markets that had long been reserved for small businesses, on employment in informal manufacturing enterprises. On average and ceteris paribus, dereservation is associated with increased employment in larger informal ‘establishments’, but not in tiny household enterprises (1995 - 2006), attributable in part to increases in product market competition with large formal firms...|$|E
40|$|Greece has an {{imperfect}} track-record of structural reform implementation. However, the poor growth {{outcome of the}} Greek programmes is also {{a consequence of the}} timing and composition of reforms, which were not optimally geared towards a speedy transition to a new growth model based on the private sector. While the main responsibility for this lies with the Greek authorities, international institutions share the responsibility for the poor growth-enhancing effect of reforms. In the current context, further structural reform efforts should be mainly targeted at supporting Greece's speedy return to solid growth rates. This is not only because poverty and unemployment have reached very high levels, but also for political economy reasons: reforms must quickly be seen to be working in order to buttress the consensus in favour of reform. Further efforts should be made to improve Greece’s business environment and to <b>liberalise</b> <b>product</b> markets, in addition to shifting taxation away from labour and towards consumption. Reforms {{to improve the quality of}} institutions should continue and are very much needed in the Greek setting, while taking into account that their demanding implementation might use up administrative capacity and their impact on growth will only be seen over long time horizons...|$|R
