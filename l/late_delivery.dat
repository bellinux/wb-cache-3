5|$|Labour difficulties, <b>late</b> <b>delivery</b> of equipment, {{additional}} requirements for Australian operations, and the prioritisation of merchant shipping over naval construction delayed {{the completion of}} Majestic. Incorporation of the new systems and enhancements caused {{the cost of the}} RAN carrier acquisition program to increase to AU£8.3million. Construction and fitting out did not finish until October 1955. As the carrier neared completion, a commissioning crew was formed in Australia and first used to return Vengeance to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Wales was {{originally}} named King Edward VIII but upon the abdication of Edward VIII {{the ship was}} renamed even before she had been laid down. This occurred at Cammell Laird's shipyard in Birkenhead on 1 January 1937, {{although it was not}} until 3 May 1939 that she was launched. She was still fitting out when war was declared in September, causing her construction schedule, and that of her sister, , to be accelerated. Nevertheless, the <b>late</b> <b>delivery</b> of gun mountings caused delays in her outfitting.|$|E
5|$|Delayed by the <b>late</b> <b>delivery</b> of its propeller, {{the first}} {{prototype}} was rolled out at Brough in February 1947 and then taken by road to RAF Leconfield where {{it made its}} maiden flight on 1 April that year. All three prototypes were completed {{by the end of}} September and the third prototype had been modified to reduce the outer-wing dihedral to 3 degrees. Both the second and third prototypes remained unflown when the Ministry of Supply ordered that flying be ceased and work on the aircraft be stopped. Later in the month, however, the third prototype was allocated to tests of powered aileron controls, as testing of the first prototype had shown that while adequate at cruise speed, the ailerons were heavy both at low and high speed. The second prototype was allocated to structural testing.|$|E

5|$|Poltava {{was named}} for the victory at the 1709 Battle of Poltava when Peter the Great {{defeated}} King Charles XII of Sweden. Delayed by shortages of skilled workmen, design changes and <b>late</b> <b>delivery</b> of the main armament, the ship was laid down on 19 May 1892 at the Galernii Island shipyard and launched on 6 November 1894. Her trials lasted from 1898 to 1899 and she was then briefly assigned to the Baltic Fleet. Together with her sister ship , Poltava had a radio installed in September 1900, the first ships in the Imperial Russian Navy to get such equipment. On 15 October the sisters set sail for Port Arthur and later had to unload much of their ammunition, coal and other stores to reduce their drafts enough {{to pass through the}} Suez Canal. Poltava arrived at Port Arthur on 12 April 1901, the day before her sister.|$|E
5|$|The {{share capital}} was {{expanded}} to NOK20 million in September 1987. Among the purchasers was Ansett Australia, who bought a twenty-percent stake. Ragnar Lyng replaced Adeserø {{as chairman and}} Johan H. Gedde-Dahl was hired as managing director. Original plans were to start operations on 24 October 1987, but {{this had to be}} postponed due to <b>late</b> <b>delivery</b> of the aircraft. Revenue flights commenced in February 1988, after delivery of the airline's first 148-passenger Boeing 737-300, City of Trondheim. The airline's second 737-300, City of Stavanger, was delivered the same month, but was leased to Monarch Airlines. About sixty percent of the company's initial business was flying on contract with Sun Tours.|$|E
5|$|As the TR-1 engines {{originally}} {{intended for the}} Su-9 were not yet ready for flight testing in late 1945, Pavel Sukhoi suggested substituting a pair of Jumo 004 engines and this was approved on 15 December. The full-scale mockup {{was found to be}} acceptable on 16 February 1946 and the Council of People's Commissars issued an order on 26 February that the manufacturer's flight testing was to begin on 1 November. This goal was not met because the OKB was heavily committed to other projects like the trainer version of the Tupolev Tu-2 bomber, inexperience with JATO units, and <b>late</b> <b>delivery</b> of RD-10 engines. The first prototype was completed in mid-October and made its first flight on 13 November. The test pilots found the aircraft easy to fly, but the control forces were very high at speed and it lacked enough directional stability. Enlarging the vertical stabilizer cured this last problem and hydraulic boosters were fitted for the control system.|$|E
25|$|While Kawasaki had {{few or no}} {{problems}} in delivering the R160Bs, Alstom was behind on its delivery schedule {{early on in the}} R160A order. Alstom was to deliver 200 out of the 400-car base order by September 2007. However, by that month, Alstom had only delivered 80 cars. Under the base contract, Alstom agreed to pay damages of $800 a day for <b>late</b> <b>deliveries</b> of four-car trains, and $1,000 a day for five-car trains, though the Transit Authority had not yet fined Alstom for its <b>late</b> <b>deliveries</b> and was actually negotiating with Alstom to accelerate their delivery schedule.

5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Braathens SAFE {{started looking for}} a {{replacement}} for the aging DC-3s and Herons. An order was placed with Fokker for the delivery of their new Fokker F-27 Friendship, a two-engine turboprop with cabin pressurization. Braathens SAFE was the second airline to receive the plane, after Aer Lingus. The first craft, LN-SUN, was delivered in December 1958, with the second, LN-SUO, delivered the following year. They were put into service on the main routes: once daily Oslo–Trondheim, once daily Oslo–Ålesund, twice daily Oslo–Stavanger, including one stopping at Kristiansand, and one trip daily Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim. The delivery of the Friendships made the Herons unnecessary, and these were sold. The two DC-3s were kept as a reserve, and {{were used for the}} first part of the summer schedules because of <b>late</b> <b>delivery</b> of LN-SUO. They were also used for charter. The airports at Hamar, Farsund and Tønsberg had too short runways for the Friendship, and these destinations were terminated.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1997, NSB's board {{decided to}} {{purchase}} eleven of the locomotives, excluding number 664. This {{was based on}} an agreement whereby NSB would receive compensation for the incurred losses owing to <b>late</b> <b>delivery</b> and under-performance. Siemens guaranteed that ten of eleven locomotives would be operational at any time. All units were again grounded in January 1998, following two fires. Siemens had between 15 and 20 employees stationed in Trondheim to fix the issues. Regularity on the Nordland Line plummeted from 67 to 46 percent with the introduction of Di6. NSB was forced to keep 15 Di3s, which were up to 42 years old, in operational condition to keep services running. The extra costs of keeping the Di3s running were about NOK50 million per year. These costs would continue until NSB could take delivery of new locomotives, which could take up to three years from the time of order. One contributing factor was a 25percent extra wage for engineers for having above-regulation noise levels in the Di3 cabs. Two Di3s were often run along with a Di6 in a train as backup; should the Di6 fail, the Di3 would continue hauling the train.|$|E
5|$|Pre-production was {{originally}} estimated at ten months, but ultimately extended to fourteen months. Each {{time a new}} movement or ability was created for the Prince, it required adjustments to multiple other systems, as leaving them alone would have damaged the game. They also needed to make adjustments to the enemy and partner artificial intelligence, {{and they did not}} have time to polish those systems. All this meant that the debugging started much later than originally scheduled. The Prince had over 780 scripted movements, far more than any other character in the game. This caused problems with creating the movements for other characters. To make the character movements realistic, the team used motion capture to animate their movements. Art director Raphael Lacoste did not join the team until July 2002, well into the game's production, resulting in multiple delays in creating the game's environments. This issue was compounded by the need to produce a demo for the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo, then to deliver an entire game at the same if not a higher quality than the demo. Each environment needed to work for the Prince's set of movements and abilities: the work needed involved checking each rewind sequence, and each of the Prince's movement in and effect on the environment worked. These issues were compounded by the <b>late</b> <b>delivery</b> of environmental maps. In hindsight, producer Yannis Mallat lamented the fact {{that they did not have}} enough time to work out the problems caused by these issues. Despite these problems, other parts of production including play-testing, management of creative tools, and the integrated testing system worked smoothly. A cited example was the team discovering a tester that was good at finding severe bugs, so they included her in one of their testing groups, giving her a development kit she could use to sort out those bugs. This was replicated, and managed to greatly increase the amount of bugs that could be found and fixed. The development team's enthusiasm was also high, which enabled the problems during development to be overcome. During the aftermath of E3, the team considered release The Sands of Time as two games so they could include all the desired content, but the idea was dropped. Another element that needed to be cut after the demo was a griffin boss that would appear three times during the Prince's journey.|$|E

25|$|Dunne had {{obtained}} a War Office order for two D.8s, though one was cancelled because of <b>late</b> <b>delivery.</b> The other {{was delivered to}} Farnborough on 3 March 1914, where it was given the RFC number 366. It made several flights on 11 March piloted by N. S. Percival, who had flown the first D.8 many times at Eastchurch and was now an RFC officer. The general judgement {{was that in the}} search for balance between stability and controllability, the Dunne design overemphasised the former.|$|E
25|$|L6844 first flew on 11 October 1938, {{construction}} {{having been}} delayed chiefly due to the new features and {{also because of the}} <b>late</b> <b>delivery</b> of the engines. L6844 was passed to RAE Farnborough {{at the end of the}} year, while further service trials were later carried out at Martlesham Heath. The Whirlwind exhibited excellent handling characteristics and proved to be very easy to fly at all speeds. The only exception was the inadequate directional control during take-off which necessitated an increased rudder area above the tailplane.|$|E

25|$|In 1946, {{management}} {{was transferred to}} Goulandris Bros Ltd, London. On 29 July 1948, Empire Cowdray was sold to her managers and was renamed Granhill. In 1950, Granhill ran aground in the Weser at Bremen, West Germany. She was refloated undamaged. In December 1950, she loaded a cargo of timber at Lagos, Nigeria. Her boilers had been filled with river water at Sapele. On 7 January 1951, one of her boilers failed due to sludge. The ship was in the Bay of Biscay at the time. She {{had to be taken}} in tow and various expenses were sustained by Goulandris Bros. In 1957, the owners of the timber successfully sued Goulandris Brothers for £22 10s 4d for losses incurred due to the <b>late</b> <b>delivery</b> of the timber.

25|$|The {{flight test}} {{program is to}} involve {{a total of three}} prototypes, {{designated}} P1, P2, and P3. The first prototype, P1, performed early test flights during {{the first phase of the}} flight test program, during which the handling and attitude of the aircraft were explored and the flight envelope gradually expanded, including autorotation tests and being flown at up to 97 per cent of its maximum internal load takeoff weight. P2 and P3 are the main vehicles for airworthiness certification testing; they are more representative of production aircraft, their design incorporating several refinements that had been made based upon experiences with P1. Following on from EASA certification, Marenco aims to quickly achieve Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification for the North American market as well. Completion of P1 was reportedly delayed by as much as six months due to the <b>late</b> <b>delivery</b> of its engine by Honeywell. In December 2013, the completed P1 was revealed to the public.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the basic}} {{assumptions}} of the classical dynamic lot-sizing model is that the aggregate demand of a given period must be satisfied in that period. Under this assumption, if backlogging is not allowed then the demand of a given period cannot be delivered earlier or later than the period. If backlogging is allowed, the demand of a given period cannot be delivered earlier than the period, but can be delivered later {{at the expense of}} a backordering cost. Like most mathematical models, the classical dynamic lot-sizing model is a simplified paraphrase of what might actually happen in real life. In most real life applications, the customer offers a grace period - we call it a demand time window - during which a particular demand can be satisfied with no penalty. That is, in association with each demand, the customer specifies an earliest and a <b>latest</b> <b>delivery</b> time. The time interval characterized by the earliest and <b>latest</b> <b>delivery</b> dates of a demand represents the corresponding time window.|$|R

500|$|Suffren, {{named after}} the French admiral Pierre André de Suffren de Saint-Tropez, was ordered on 21 April 1898 from the Arsenal de Brest. She was laid down on 5 January 1899 and {{launched}} on 25 July of the same year. Her fitting-out was delayed by <b>late</b> <b>delivery</b> of fittings and armour from July 1900. Suffren began her sea trials in November 1903, but was not commissioned until 3 February 1904. On 18 August 1903 she participated in a gunnery trial with the pre-dreadnought [...] off Île Longue. A mild steel plate [...] thick, measuring , {{was attached to the}} side of Suffrens forward turret to determine the resistance of an armour plate to a large-calibre shell. Masséna anchored [...] away from Suffren and fired a number of [...] shells at the plate. The first three were training shells that knocked splinters off the armour plate.
