40|$|Introduction: G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) {{form one}} of the largest groups of {{potential}} targets for novel medications. Low druggability of many GPCR targets and inefficient sampling of chemical space in high-throughput screening expertise however often hinder discovery of drug discovery leads for GPCRs. Fragment-based drug discovery is an alternative approach to the conventional strategy and has proven its efficiency on several enzyme targets. Based on developments in biophysical screening techniques, receptor stabilization and in vitro assays, virtual and experimental fragment screening and fragment-based lead discovery recently became applicable for GPCR targets. Areas covered: This article provides a review of the biophysical as well as biological detection techniques suitable to study GPCRs together with their applications to screen fragment libraries and identify fragment-size ligands of cell surface receptors. The article presents several recent examples including both virtual and experimental protocols for fragment hit discovery and early hit to lead progress. Expert opinion: With the recent progress in biophysical detection techniques, the advantages of fragment-based drug discovery could be exploited for GPCR targets. Structural information on GPCRs will be more abundantly available for early stages of drug discovery projects, providing information on the binding process and efficiently supporting the progression of fragment hit to <b>lead.</b> In <b>silico</b> approaches in combination with biological assays can be used to address structurally challenging GPCRs and confirm biological relevance of interaction early in the drug discovery project...|$|R
40|$|Virtual {{screening}} of the ChemDiversity and ChemBridge compound databases against dynamin I (dynI) GTPase activity identified 2, 5 -bis-(benzylamino) - 1, 4 - benzoquinone 1 as a 273 ± 106 µM inhibitor. In <b>silico</b> <b>lead</b> optimization and focused library-led synthesis resulted {{in the development of}} four discrete benzoquinone/naphthoquinone based compound libraries comprising 54 compounds in total. Sixteen analogues were more potent than lead 1, with 2, 5 -bis-(4 -hydroxyanilino) - 1, 4 -benzoquinone (45) and 2, 5 -bis(4 -carboxyanilino) - 1, 4 -benzoquinone (49) the most active with IC 50 values of 11. 1 ± 3. 6 and 10. 6 ± 1. 6 µM respectively. Molecular modelling suggested a number of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were involved in stabilization of 49 within the dynI GTP binding site. Six of the most active inhibitors were evaluated for potential inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Quinone 45 was the most effective CME inhibitor with an IC 50 (CME) of 36 ± 16 µM...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} of human haematopoiesis {{is a complex}} biological system with numerous interdependent processes. In vivo Haematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) selfrenew so as to maintain a constant pool of these cells. It would {{be very interesting to}} maintain these cells in vitro, in view of their therapeutical importance. Unfortunately, there is currently no known process to activate HSCs self-renewal in vitro. Since the difficulties related to in vitro experiments, modeling and simulating this process is indispensable. Moreover, the complexity of haematopoiesis makes it necessary to integrate various functionalities: both discrete and continuous models as well as consumption and production of resources. We thus focus on the use of Hybrid Functional Petri Nets, which offer a number of features and flexibility. We begin by modeling and simulating the role of a specific cytokine, interleukin- 6, in the {{regulation of}} early haematopoiesis. Results obtained in <b>silico</b> <b>lead</b> to the disappearence of HSCs, which is in agreement with in vitro results. ...|$|R
40|$|Continuum electrostatics is {{combined}} with rigorous free-energy calculations {{in an effort to}} deliver a reliable and efficient method for in <b>silico</b> <b>lead</b> optimization. The methodology is tested by calculation of the relative binding free energies of a set of inhibitors of neuraminidase, cyclooxygenase 2, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2. The calculated free energies are compared to the results obtained with explicit solvent simulations and empirical scoring functions. For cyclooxygenase 2, deficiencies in the continuum electrostatics theory are identified and corrected with a modified simulation protocol. For neuraminidase, it is shown that a continuum representation of the solvent leads to markedly different protein-ligand interactions compared to the explicit solvent simulations, and a reconciliation of the two protocols is problematic. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 proves more challenging, and none of the methods employed in this study yield high quality predictions. Despite the differences observed, for these systems, the use of an implicit solvent framework to predict the ranking of congeneric inhibitors to a protein is shown to be faster, as accurate or more accurate than the explicit solvent protocol, and superior to empirical scoring schemes...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{emergence}} and re-emergence of alphaviruses, {{in particular}} the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), in numerous countries has invoked a worldwide threat to human health, while simultaneously generating an economic burden on affected countries. There are currently no vaccines or effective drugs available {{for the treatment of}} the CHIKV, and with few lead compounds reported, the vital medicinal chemistry is significantly more challenging. This study reports on the discovery of potential inhibitors for the nsP 3 macro domain of CHIKV using molecular docking, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics simulations, as well as work done to evaluate and confirm the active site of nsP 3. Virtual screening was carried out based on blind docking as well as focused docking, using the database of 1541 compounds from NCI Diversity Set II, to identify hit compounds for nsP 3. The top hit compounds were further subjected to molecular dynamic simulations, yielding a greater understanding of the dynamic behavior of nsP 3 and its complexes with various ligands, concurrently confirming the outcomes of docking, and establishing in <b>silico</b> <b>lead</b> compounds which target the CHIKV nsP 3 enzyme...|$|R
40|$|Hundreds of {{millions}} of U. S. dollars are invested in {{the research and development}} of a single drug. Lead compound development is an area ripe for new design strategies. Therapeutic lead candidates have been traditionally found using high-throughput in vitro pharmacologic screening, a costly method for assaying thousands of compounds. This approach has recently been augmented by virtual screening, which employs computer models of the target protein to narrow the search for possible leads. A variant of virtual screening is fragment-based drug design, an emerging in <b>silico</b> <b>lead</b> discovery method that introduces low molecular weight fragments, rather than intact compounds, into the binding pocket of the receptor model. These fragments serve as starting points for growing the lead candidate. Current efforts in virtual fragment-based drug design within central nervous system (CNS) targets are reviewed, as is a recent rule-based optimization strategy in which new molecules are generated within a 3 D receptor binding pocket using the fragment as a scaffold. This process places special emphasis on creating synthesizable molecules but also exposes computational questions worth addressing. Fragment-based methods provide a viable, relatively low-cost alternative for therapeutic lead discovery and optimization that can be applied to CNS targets to augment current design strategies...|$|R
40|$|We devised {{software}} tools to systematically investigate the contents and contexts of bacterial tRNA and tmRNA genes, which are known insertion hotspots for genomic islands (GIs). The strategy, based on MAUVE-facilitated multigenome comparisons, {{was used to}} examine 87 Escherichia coli MG 1655 tRNA and tmRNA genes and their orthologues in E. coli EDL 933, E. coli CFT 073 and Shigella flexneri Sf 301. Our approach identified 49 GIs occupying ∼ 1. 7 Mb that mapped to 18 tRNA genes, missing 2 but identifying a further 30 GIs as compared with Islander [Y. Mantri and K. P. Williams (2004), Nucleic Acids Res., 32, D 55 –D 58]. All these GIs had many strain-specific CDS, anomalous GC contents and/or significant dinucleotide biases, consistent with foreign origins. Our analysis demonstrated marked conservation of sequences flanking both empty tRNA sites and tRNA-associated GIs across all four genomes. Remarkably, there were only 2 upstream and 5 downstream deletions adjacent to the 328 loci investigated. In silico PCR analysis based on conserved flanking regions was also used to interrogate hotspots in another eight completely or partially sequenced E. coli and Shigella genomes. The tools developed are ideal for the analysis of other bacterial species and will <b>lead</b> to in <b>silico</b> and experimental discovery of new genomic islands.

40|$|Background: Antifungal drug {{resistance}} and few numbers of available drugs limit therapeutic options against fungal infections. The {{present study was}} designed to discover new antifungal drugs.   M aterials and Methods: This study was carried out in two separate steps, that is, in <b>silico</b> <b>lead</b> identification and in vitro assaying of antifungal potential. A structural data file of a ternary complex of fusicuccin (legend), C terminus of H + -ATPase and 14 - 3 - 3 regulatory protein (1 o 9 F. pdb file) was used as a model. Computational screening of a virtual 3 D database of drug-like molecules was performed and selected small molecules, resembling the functional part of the ligand performing ligand docking, were tested using ArgusLab (4. 0. 1). Two lead compounds, 3 -Cyclohexan propionic acid (CXP) and 4 -phenyl butyric acid (PBA) were selected according to their ligation scores. Standard Strains of Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used to measure the antifungal potential of the two identified lead compounds against the fungi using micro-well plate dilution assay.   R es ults: Ligation scores for CXP and PBA were - 9. 33744 and - 10. 7259 kcal/mol, respectively, and MIC and MFC of CXP and PBA against the two yeasts were promising.   C onclusion: The evidence from the present study suggests that CXP and PBA possess potentially antifungals properties.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Cartilage {{homeostasis}} {{relies on}} an intricate balance between anabolic and catabolic processes. In osteoarthritis this balance is shifted towards catabolism, leading to hypertrophy and a gradual degradation of cartilage tissue. So far, drug-based intervention {{in this process}} has shown limited progress. We propose to construct a mathematical model of the molecular network that governs key processes in articular cartilage homeostasis. This model {{can be used as}} a platform for model expansion by introduction of new experimental findings and hypotheses. Methods: We recently developed ANIMO (Analysis of Networks with Interactive Modeling), an intuitive software tool for modeling molecular networks. Here, we demonstrate a mathematical model of growth plate cartilage using a combination of literature and experimental data. We show how ANIMO allows for intuitive exploration of the model, despite the size and complexity of the model. Results: We constructed a network model of regulatory processes in growth plate chondrocytes. In this model the effects downstream of extracellular growth factors FGF, WNT, IGF- 1, PTHrP, Ihh, BMP, and TGF-β are integrated into a cellular response. In silico experiments predict the phenotypic outcome for different inputs and starting states of the model. Osteoarthritic chondrocytes and hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes show strong parallels in their gene expression profile. We have examined the gene expression profiles of growth plate and articular cartilage. In articular cartilage the expression of the WNT and BMP antagonists DKK 1, FRZB and GREM 1 is over 10 - 500 fold higher than in growth plate cartilage. This leads us to think that DKK 1, FRZB, GREM 1 could act as gatekeepers for preventing hypertrophy. We are currently investigating the range of conditions under which these proteins exert their stabilizing effect on the articular cartilage phenotype in the model. Furthermore, we are interrogating the model to obtain in <b>silico</b> <b>leads</b> to targets for novel combination therapies. Such therapies could be used to intervene in the osteoarthritic state of the network and restore the balanced situation of healthy cartilage. Conclusions: Traditionally, modeling efforts in the realm of molecular cell biology have been the exclusive domain of researchers with a thorough training in mathematics or computer science. We show here that a complex model that is intuitively amenable to exploration and adaptation by biologists is an invaluable asset in cartilage research. Expansion of an existing model with DKK 1, FRZB and GREM 1 provided evidence for their role in preserving the articular cartilage phenotype...|$|R

Reintroduction of generic drugs by second medical use patents also contributes to cheaper and faster drug development processes. We screened, in silico, the Food and Drug Administration-approved generic drug database {{by means of the}} One-dimensional Drug Profile Matching (oDPM) method in order to find potential peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists. The PPARγ action of the selected generics was also investigated by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Materials and methods: The in silico oDPM method was used to determine the binding potency of 1, 255 generics to 149 proteins collected. In vitro PPARγ activation was determined by measuring fatty acid-binding protein 4 /adipocyte protein gene expression in a Mono Mac 6 cell line. The in vivo insulin sensitizing effect of the selected compound (nitazoxanide; 50 – 200 mg/kg/day over 8 days; n = 8) was established in type 2 diabetic rats by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamping. Results: After examining the closest neighbors of each of the reference set’s members and counting their most abundant neighbors, ten generic drugs were selected with oDPM. Among them, four enhanced fatty acid-binding protein/adipocyte protein gene expression in the Mono Mac 6 cell line, but only bromfenac and nitazoxanide showed dose-dependent actions. Induction by nitazoxanide was higher than by bromfenac. Nitazoxanide lowered fasting blood glucose levels and improved insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic rats. Conclusion: We demonstrated that the oDPM method can predict previously unknown therapeutic effects of generic drugs. Nitazoxanide can be the prototype chemical structure of the new generation of insulin sensitizers.
