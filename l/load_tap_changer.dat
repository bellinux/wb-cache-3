50|$|<b>Load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> (LTC): Load {{tap changers}} are devices used {{to change the}} tap {{position}} on transformers. These devices work automatically or can be controlled via another local IED or from a remote operator or process.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tap</b> <b>changers</b> {{exist in}} two primary types, no <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> (NLTC) {{which must be}} {{de-energized}} before the turn ratio is adjusted and on <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> (OLTC) which may adjust their turn ratio during operation. The tap selection on any <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> may be made via an automatic system, {{as is often the}} case for OLTC, or a manual <b>tap</b> <b>changer,</b> which is more common for NLTC. Additionally, <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> are often placed on the high voltage (low current) transformer winding for easy access and to minimize the current load during operation.|$|R
40|$|While Voltage Regulators and <b>Load</b> <b>Tap</b> <b>Changers</b> (LTC's) {{have been}} an {{integral}} part of the maintaining adequate voltage on the Distribution System for years, it has been taken for granted that engineers understand the fundamentals that are helpful with implementation of these devices on the system. This thesis will provide a review of both types of equipment and will recommend ways that they can be used more effectively on the Distribution System. In addition, this thesis will specifically analyze the use of the Open-Delta Regulator on unbalanced 3 -wire systems using OpenDSS. The thesis challenges the notion of not using Open-Delta regulators on an unbalanced system. Lastly, it will also examine the effectiveness of <b>Load</b> <b>Tap</b> <b>Changers</b> settings and the use of <b>Load</b> <b>Tap</b> <b>Changers</b> in tandem with Substation Capacitors. This is important because both maintaining adequate voltage and providing reactive power to the distribution system are priorities that seem to compete at times...|$|R

Unlike PMUs, FDRs can be installed at buildings and offices.|$|R
50|$|For many power {{transformer}} applications, a supply interruption during a tap change is unacceptable, and the transformer is often {{fitted with a}} more expensive and complex on load tap changing (OLTC, sometimes <b>Load</b> <b>Tap</b> <b>Changer,</b> LTC) mechanism. On load tap changers may be generally classified as either mechanical, electronically assisted, or fully electronic.|$|E
50|$|No load {{tap changers}} are also {{employed}} in high voltage transformers {{in which the}} system includes a no <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> on the primary winding to accommodate system variations within a narrow band around the nominal rating. In such systems, the tap changer will often be set just once, {{at the time of}} installation, although it may be changed later during a scheduled outage to accommodate a long-term change in the system voltage profile.|$|E
50|$|IEDs {{receive data}} from sensors and power equipment, and can issue control commands, such as {{tripping}} circuit breakers if they sense voltage, current, or frequency anomalies, or raise/lower voltage levels {{in order to}} maintain the desired level. Common types of IEDs include protective relaying devices, On <b>Load</b> <b>Tap</b> <b>Changer</b> controllers, circuit breaker controllers, capacitor bank switches, recloser controllers, voltage regulators etc. This is generally controlled by a setting file. The testing of setting files is typically one of the most time consuming roles of a protection tester.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{novel model}} of fully {{electronic}} on <b>load</b> semiconductor <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> for power transformer has been proposed.

In this work Simulink model was designed with GTOs as switching devices embedded in taps. Step change of voltage is achieved changing taps by switching GTOs and fine voltage with error less than ± 0. 1 % is obtained by sequential firing control between GTOs in the system, which is not possible in conventional automatic OLTC control system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{monitoring}} and control of tap changer mechanism of a transformer implementation in an Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) is discussed. It has been a custom for decades to provide a separate panel for on <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> control for monitoring the tap position. However, this facility cannot either record or transfer the information to remote control centers. As there is a technology shift towards the smart grid protection and control standards, the need for implementing remote control and monitoring has necessitated the implementation of this feature in numerical relays. This paper deals with the programming, settings and logic implementation which is applicable to both IEC 61850 compatible and non-compatible IEDs thereby {{eliminating the need for}} separate tap changer control equipment. The monitoring mechanism has been implemented in a 28 MVA, 110 / 6. 9 kV transformer with 16 tap position with GE make T 60 IED at Ultratech cement limited Gulbarga, Karnataka and is in successful service. Keywords—Transformer protection, tap changer control, tap position monitoring, on <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer,</b> intelligent electronic device (IED). I...|$|E
40|$|Series and shunt {{admittance}} values of under <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> transformers are changed according to tap changing. As this situation changes {{the structure of}} bus admittance matrix, it causes the need of rebuilding the bus admittance matrix at each tap changing case in power flow studies. In this paper, a new approach that includes the tap changing effects into the Jacobian matrix. By this approach, the need of rebuilding the bus admittance matrix at each tap changing case during power flow study is prevented. So, fast convergence is achieved for the power flow algorithm. Although there are similar studies for this aim in the literature, apart from these studies, including the tap changing effects to the Jacobian matrix when more than one under <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> transformers {{are connected to the}} same bus with different connection combinations is provided by the proposed approach. For this aim, new power equations and new Jacobian matrix component calculation equations are obtained. The proposed approach is tested on IEEE 57 -bus test system and its accuracy is proved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{identifying}} emergency conditions during system operation in the case of voltage instability. A novel detection scheme is proposed based on measurement of the controlled voltage of bulk power delivery transformers equipped with <b>Load</b> <b>Tap</b> <b>Changers.</b> The detection is based on the comparison of successive post-tap-change voltages. The detection scheme is purely local, even though it senses a system-wide emergency condition. It is shown that the condition detected is a precursor to maximum loadability and voltage instability. © 2007 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a Lyapunov-based hybrid control {{strategy}} for voltage stabilization of power systems. These systems are hybrid {{due to the}} discontinuous nature of the control inputs, and the state-automata structure imposed by the on <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> acting as secondary voltage controllers. The proposed algorithm is derived from a nu-merical search algorithm that intent to decrease {{the value of an}} associated Lyapunov function subject to a set of con-straints. This leads to a Lyapunov based logic switching strategy that is successfully tested in a simulation study case...|$|R
50|$|No <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> {{are often}} {{utilized}} in {{situations in which}} a transformers turn ratio does not require frequent changing and it is permissible to de-energize the transformer system. This type of transformer is frequently employed in low power, low voltage transformers in which the tap point often may {{take the form of}} a transformer connection terminal, requiring the input line to be disconnected by hand and connected to the new terminal. Alternatively, in some systems, the process of tap changing may be assisted by means of a rotary or slider switch.|$|R
