40|$|Analyses of monthly minimum {{temperatures}} and daily minimum temperatures show that significantly more Sudden Infant Deaths and 'pneumonitis' deaths occur in colder conditions in southern Tasmania. <b>Low</b> <b>minimum</b> monthly and <b>low</b> <b>minimum</b> daily temperatures 'explain' {{part of the}} observed winter seasonal peak of deaths. However, a sharp change of temperature over 24 hours, either upwards or downwards, is associated with fewer deaths than occured when little or no change of temperature had been experienced. Utilising the additional data of the Tasmania-wide series it is shown that the winter seasonal effect is expecially evident in infants over 3 months of age compared with those aged only 0 - 3 months, in whom seasonal variation did not occur. ...|$|R

[...] In 2015, working with then Mayor Michael Brennan, Hinck was instrumental in assuring passage of a measure {{that for the first time}} set a minimum wage in the City of Portland higher than the statewide minimum.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} ten years, many {{algorithms}} have been proposed to mine frequent itemsets. In order to fairly evaluate their behavior, the IEEE/ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations (FIMI’ 03) has been recently organized. According to its analysis, kDCI++ is a state-of-the-art algorithm. However, it can be observed from the FIMI’ 03 experiments that its efficient behavior does not occur for <b>low</b> <b>minimum</b> supports, specially on sparse databases. Aiming at improving kDCI++ and making it even more competitive, we present the kDCI- 3 algorithm. This proposal directly accesses candidates {{not only in the}} first iterations but specially in the third one, which represents, in general, the highest computational cost of kDCI++ for <b>low</b> <b>minimum</b> supports. Results have shown that kDCI- 3 outperforms kDCI++ in the conducted experiments. When compared to other important algorithms, kDCI- 3 enlarged the number of times kDCI++ presented the best behavior. ...|$|R
