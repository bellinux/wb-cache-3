40|$|The {{feasibility}} of on-wafer wireless test is assessed in this paper. By replacing expensive high-frequency probe cards with wireless data <b>link,</b> <b>testing</b> cost can potentially be lowered. Key elements for wireless test at the wafer level include on-chip antenna and RF transceivers. A 24 -GHz on-chip folded dipole antenna {{has been designed}} to fit in the scribe-lines between the silicon dies. The measured antenna gain shows - 22. 6 dBi. The power budget for a data link between a wafer with on-chip antenna and a tester equipped with high-gain horn antenna is presented. Our finding verifies that the required SNR and antenna bandwidth for wireless test can be achieved. Based on the measured antenna characteristics, several wireless test examples are illustrated. © 2008 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Consider a {{computer}} network represented by an undirected graph where the vertices represent computer nodes and the edges represent {{links between the}} nodes.

In graph theoretic terms, a vertex cover is a subset of the vertices such that every edge is incident to at least one vertex in this set. Our objective then is to find a minimum vertex cover.

We specifically look into traceback techniques such as <b>link</b> <b>testing</b> – input debugging and controlled flooding, packet marking, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) floodback and packet logging. With respect to packet marking, we developed simulation code to analyze the relationship between the probability of marking by a router, convergence time and the hop count attack of an attack path. The convergence time is defined as the minimum threshold number of packets required to determine the sequence of routers that form the attack path. We conclude the paper by presenting a comparison of the different IP traceback techniques studied...|$|E
40|$|A {{residual}} force {{technique is}} presented that can perform the transient analyses of large, flexible, and joint dominated structures. The technique permits substantial size {{reduction in the}} number of degrees of freedom describing the nonlinear structural models and can account for such nonlinear joint phenomena as free-play and hysteresis. In general, joints can have arbitrary force-state map representations but these are used in the form of residual force maps. One essential feature of the technique is to replace the arbitrary force-state maps describing the nonlinear joints with residual force maps describing the truss links. The main advantage of this replacement is that the incrementally small relative displacements and velocities across a joint are not monitored directly thereby avoiding numerical difficulties. Instead, very small and 'soft' residual forces are defined giving a numerically attractive form for the equations of motion and thereby permitting numerically stable integration algorithms. The technique was successfully applied to the transient analyses of a large 58 bay, 60 meter truss having nonlinear joints. A method to perform <b>link</b> <b>testing</b> is also presented...|$|E

40|$|A {{high data}} rate laser {{transmitter}} assembly (LTA) has been designed as the source for an optical free-space communication link between the International Space Station and the 1 -meter Optical Communication Telescope Laboratory (OCTL) to be built at the Table Mountain Facility (IMF, Wrightwood, CA). The transmitter design concept uses a fiber-based master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) configuration with an average output power of 200 made at a 1550 nm transmit wavelength. This transmitter source is also {{designed to provide a}} signal at 980 nm to the Silicon-based focal plane array for the point-ahead beam control function. This novel integration of a 980 nm boresight signal allows the use of Silicon based imagers for the acquisition/tracking and point-ahead functions, yet permits the transmit signal to be at any wavelength outside the Silicon sensitivity. The LTA, a sub-system of the Flight Terminal, has been designed to have a selectable data rate from 155 - 2500 Mbps in discrete steps.

40|$|Ontology {{development}} {{relates to}} software development {{in that they}} both involve the production of formal computational knowledge. It is possible, therefore, {{that some of the}} techniques used in software engineering could also be used for ontologies; for example, in software engineering testing is a well-established process, and part of many different methodologies. The application of testing to ontologies, therefore, seems attractive. The Karyotype Ontology is developed using the novel Tawny-OWL library. This provides a fully programmatic environment for ontology development, which includes a complete test harness. In this paper, we describe how we have used this harness to build an extensive series of tests as well as used a commodity continuous integration system to <b>link</b> <b>testing</b> deeply into our development process; this environment, is applicable to any OWL ontology whether written using Tawny-OWL or not. Moreover, we present a novel analysis of our tests, introducing a new classification of what our different tests are. For each class of test, we describe why we use these tests, also by comparison to software tests. We believe that this systematic comparison between ontology and software development will help us move to a more agile form of ontology development.

40|$|In (Distributed) Denial of Service attack ((D) DoS), attack-ers send a {{huge number}} of packets with spoofed source ad-dresses to {{disguise}} themselves toward a target host or net-work. Various IP traceback techniques such as <b>link</b> <b>testing,</b> marking, and logging to find out the real source of attack-ing packets have been proposed. We present a new marking scheme (with marking and traceback algorithms) in which a router marks a packet with a link that the packet came through. Links of a router are represented by Huffman codes according to the traffic distribution among the links. If the packet runs out of space allotted for the marking field in the packet header, then the router stores the marking field in the router’s local memory along with a message digest of the packet. We analyze the memory requirement of routers to store marking fields, compare the new scheme with other existing techniques, and address practical issues to deploy the new scheme in the Internet. The new scheme marks every packet, therefore IP traceback can be accomplished with only a packet unlike in probabilistic markings; also it requires far less amount of memory compared to logging methods and is robust in case of DDoS. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Important {{solution}} for future telecommunication network development could be technology, {{which would allow}} construction of local area networks based on end user equipment. Such networks could be called Customer Premises Local Area Networks. There could be few suitable network topologies and communication technologies used for this solution. There is hierarchical chain of Point-to-Multipoint radio systems studied in our article as the building block for more complex topologies. This chain consists of several homogeneous or not levels. Standard CDMA (WLL and WLAN) radio systems are taken as possible prototypes in our investigation. Peculiarity of hierarchical system is growing demand for throughput at the higher hierarchical levels, because of traffic concentration from lower levels. Higher levels require higher reliability for ensuring the good network performance. EMC between the network nodes at the same hierarchical level and between levels {{is important for the}} ensuring high network reliability. Analysis is done using data collected from real links with different propagation conditions. Traffic volumes consisting of sequences of different packet length were used for <b>link</b> <b>testing.</b> These CP LAN’s could be promising {{solution for}} development of alternative radio communication networks at the suburban and rural areas with changing user densities.

40|$|Objective To {{estimate}} {{rates of}} completion of CD 4 + lymphocyte testing (CD 4 testing) within 12 weeks of {{testing positive for}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at a large HIV/AIDS clinic in South Africa, and to identify clinical and demographic predictors for completion. Methods In our study, CD 4 testing was considered complete once a patient had retrieved the test results. To determine the rate of CD 4 testing completion, we reviewed the records of all clinic patients who tested positive for HIV between January 2008 and February 2009. We identified predictors for completion through multivariate logistic regression. Findings Of the 416 patients who tested positive for HIV, 84. 6 % initiated CD 4 testing within the study timeframe. Of these patients, 54. 3 % were immediately eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART) because of a CD 4 cell count ≤ 200 /µl, but only 51. 3 % of the patients in this category completed CD 4 testing within 12 weeks of HIV testing. Among those not immediately eligible for ART (CD 4 cells> 200 / µl), only 14. 9 % completed CD 4 testing within 12 weeks. Overall, of HIV+ patients who initiated CD 4 testing, 65 % did not complete it within 12 weeks of diagnosis. The higher the baseline CD 4 cell count, the lower the odds of completing CD 4 testing within 12 weeks. Conclusion Patient losses between HIV testing, baseline CD 4 cell count {{and the start of}} care and ART are high. As a result, many patients receive ART too late.

40|$|Introduction: HIV {{self-testing}} (HIVST) has {{the potential}} to increase uptake of HIV testing among untested populations in sub-Saharan Africa and is on the brink of scale-up. However, it is unclear to what extent HIVST would be supported by stakeholders, what policy frameworks are in place and how variations between contexts might influence country-preparedness for scale-up. This qualitative study assessed the perceptions of HIVST among stakeholders in three sub-Saharan countries. Methods: Fifty-four key informant interviews were conducted in Kenya (n= 16), Malawi (n= 26) and South Africa (n= 12) with government policy makers, academics, activists, donors, procurement specialists, laboratory practitioners and health providers. A thematic analysis was conducted in each country and a common coding framework allowed for inter-country analysis to identify common and divergent themes across contexts. Results: Respondents welcomed the idea of an accurate, easy-to-use, rapid HIV self-test which could increase testing across all populations. High-risk groups, such as men, Men {{who have sex with men}} (MSM), couples and young people in particular, could be targeted through a range of health facility and community-based distribution points. HIVST is already endorsed in Kenya, and political support for scale-up exists in South Africa and Malawi. However, several caveats remain. Further research, policy and ensuing guidelines should consider how to regulate, market and distribute HIVST, ensure quality assurance of tests and human rights, and critically, <b>link</b> <b>testing</b> to appropriate support and treatment services. Low literacy levels in some target groups would also need context-specific consideration before scale up. World Health Organization (WHO) policy and regulatory frameworks are needed to guide the process in those areas which are new or specific to self-testing. Conclusions: Stakeholders in three HIV endemic sub-Saharan countries felt that HIVST will be an important complement to existing community and facility-based testing approaches if accompanied by the same essential components of any HIV testing service, including access to accurate information and linkages to care. While there is an increasingly positive global policy environment regarding HIVST, several implementation and social challenges limit scale-up. There is a need for further research to provide contextual and operational evidence that addresses concerns and contributes to normative WHO guidance...|$|E

40|$|The report {{summarizes}} what transpired during brake linings-related workshop {{held at the}} Fall 2003 {{meeting of}} the Technology and Maintenance Council (TMC) in Charlotte, NC. The title of the workshop was ''Developing a Useful Friction Material Rating System''. It was organized by a team consisting of Peter Blau (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), Jim Britell (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), and Jim Lawrence (Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association). The workshop was held {{under the auspices of}} TMC Task Force S 6 (Chassis), chaired by Joseph Stianche (Sanderson Farms, Inc.). Six invited speakers during the morning session provided varied perspectives on testing and rating aftermarket automotive and truck brake linings. They were: James R. Clark, Chief Engineer, Foundation Brakes and Wheel Equipment, Dana Corporation, Spicer Heavy Axle and Brake Division; Charles W. Greening, Jr, President, Greening Test Labs; Tim Duncan, General Manager, <b>Link</b> <b>Testing</b> Services;Dennis J. McNichol, President, Dennis NationaLease; Jim Fajerski, Business Manager, OE Sales and Applications Engineering, Federal Mogul Corporation; and Peter J. Blau, Senior Materials Development Engineer, Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The afternoon break-out sessions addressed nine questions concerning such issues as: ''Should the federal government regulate aftermarket lining quality?''; ''How many operators use RP 628, and if so, what's good or bad about it?''; and ''Would there be any value to you of a vocation-specific rating system?'' The opinions of each discussion group, consisting of 7 - 9 participants, were reported and consolidated in summary findings on each question. Some questions produced a greater degree of agreement than others. In general, the industry seems eager for more information that would allow those who are responsible for maintaining truck brakes to make better, more informed choices on aftermarket linings. A written fleet operator survey was also conducted during the TMC meeting. Twenty-one responses were received, spanning fleet sizes between 12 and 170, 000 vehicles. Responses are summarized in a series of tables separated into responses from small (100 or fewer powered vehicles), medium (101 - 1000 vehicles), and large fleets (> 1000 vehicles). The vast majority of fleets do their own brake maintenance, relying primarily on experience and lining manufactures to select aftermarket linings. At least half of the responders are familiar to some extent with TMC Recommended Practice 628 on brake linings, but most do not use this source of test data as the sole criterion to select linings. Significant shortfalls in the applicability of TMC RP 628 to certain types of brake systems were noted...|$|E
40|$|This {{purpose of}} this project was the design and {{construction}} of a testbed network for experimentation with spread spectrum communications in the 900 and 2400 MHz band. The current network consists of five fixed nodes and two portable nodes. Of the fixed nodes, three {{are located in the}} Purdue MSEE building, one is located in the Harold L. Michael Traffic Operations Laboratory, and one is located in the experimental traffic signal cabinet at the intersection of Stadium and Northwestern Avenues in West Lafayette. The testbed has been used to evaluate spread spectrum radio technologies from vendors Microwave Data Systems, GINA, and EnCom, as regards radio performance as a function of link distance and with varying levels of interference. The project has produced software {{that can be used to}} test any radio presenting a standard RS- 232 interface to customer equipment. The testbed can also be interfaced with wireless channel emulator equipment located in the Wireless Communications Research Laboratory in order to test radio performance in multipath and fading environments. The field tests conducted to date have yielded the following conclusions regarding the design of spread spectrum interconnect for the traffic signal control application. First, as regards the need for line-of-sight between radio antennas, we were able to establish a link even when line of sight was not available although the resulting communication was somewhat error prone. If an additional robust protocol were designed these radios could work even in non-line-of-sight applications. The protocol would need to emphasize an efficient retransmission scheme as opposed to the use of more powerful forward error control codes (this observation comes from the link error statistics gathered from field testing). Second, it was noted that the RSSI (which stands for received signal strength indicator) value was not a completely informative measure of link quality. In other words, the <b>link</b> <b>testing</b> software found many instances of links where RSSI was relatively large yet many errors were incurred. Such situations always involved interference or suspected interference. Third, as regards the choice of antenna (Yagi versus omni) it is concluded that Yagi antennas (with their higher gain) were preferable in long distance rural environments. But in the presence of multipath propagation or interference (as in a town or city scenario) the omni was often preferable. Finally, interference tests showed that the MDS 9810 handled the interference well at the price of the throughput; the EnCom radio had a high throughput but also a high data loss rate in certain situations. It was concluded that if the application only needs between 6 and 14 kbps, the MDS radio is an ideal choice. For higher rate applications the EnCom radio would be preferred...|$|E

The event triggered sensing and switching mechanism can also avoid unnecessary sensing and switching overheads.|$|R

The linking methods and comparability/measurement invariance approaches cited above do not apply such transformations; rather they utilize (and test) invariance assumptions in the form of parameter constraints that lead to <b>linked</b> <b>test</b> scores on the same scale, thereby allowing comparisons across countries and over time.|$|R
