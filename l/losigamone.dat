5000|$|The {{mechanism}} of action is not known. Data regarding the interaction of <b>losigamone</b> with GABA receptors are inconsistent: it increases GABA-induced chloride influx in spinal cord neuron cultures, but has no significant influence on GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in hippocampal slices.

Results from both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirm that the pharmacological activity profiles of the two <b>losigamone</b> enantiomers are not identical and suggest further that excitatory amino acid-mediated processes {{are involved in the}} mode of action of (+)-losigamone (the compound shown in the image) whereas ( [...] - [...] )-losigamone does not possess such properties.|$|E

This study investigated the effect of <b>losigamone</b> on spontaneous, NMDA- and AMPA-induced depolarizations in the cortical wedge preparation of the DBA/ 2 mouse (which are susceptible to sound-induced seizures) and on endogenous amino acid release from BALB/c mouse cortical slices. Cortical wedges exhibit spontaneous depolarizations in magnesium-free medium and <b>losigamone</b> was effective in significantly reducing these spontaneous depolarizations at concentrations of 100 [*]μM and above.

Veratridine (20 [*]μM) and potassium (60 [*]mM) were used to stimulate the release of amino acids from mouse cortex. Veratridine-stimulated release of glutamate was significantly reduced by <b>losigamone</b> at concentrations of 100 [*]μM and above, while potassium-stimulated release was significantly reduced by <b>losigamone</b> at 200 [*]μM.

40|$|Patients {{with drug}} {{resistant}} epilepsy represent about 40 % {{of the whole}} population of epileptic patients. These patients require more than one antiepileptic drug. In animal models of epilepsy, {{it is possible to}} determine which combinations produce supra-additive anticonvulsive effects with minimal or even no adverse reactions. The experimental data can be helpful for predicting effective drug combinations in patients with refractory epilepsy. <b>Losigamone</b> is a new antiepileptic drug with an unknown mechanism of action. The drug belongs to the group of �-methoxy-butenolides, and exists as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers (AO- 242 and AO- 294). The drug is eliminated by oxidation. Cytochrome CYP 2 A 6 appears to be the main isoenzyme responsible for the metabolism of <b>losigamone.</b> In vitro, <b>losigamone</b> exerts anticonvulsant activity in the picrotoxin model in CA 1 and CA 3 hippocampal areas, the low Ca 2 + model in CA 1 area and the low Mg 2 + model in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. In vivo, the drug exhibits significant efficacy against maximal electroshock-induced seizures in rodents and pentetrazoleinduce...|$|E
40|$|<b>Losigamone</b> {{is a novel}} {{anticonvulsant}} undergoing phase III {{clinical trials}} in patients with partial and secondary generalized seizures. This study investigated {{the effects of the}} S(+) - and R(−) - enantiomers of <b>losigamone</b> on endogenous amino acid release from BALB/c mouse cortical slices, spontaneous depolarizations in the cortical wedge preparation of the DBA/ 2 mouse and audiogenic seizures in DBA/ 2 mice. S(+) -losigamone (100 and 200 [*]μM) significantly reduced both potassium- and veratridine-elicited release of glutamate and aspartate from cortical slices. R(−) -losigamone had no effect on release at concentrations up to 400 [*]μM. Cortical wedges exhibit spontaneous depolarizations when perfused with magnesium-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid. S(+) -losigamone significantly reduced these depolarizations at 50 – 200 [*]μM whilst R(−) -losigamone had a significant effect at 200 – 800 [*]μM. DBA/ 2 mice are susceptible to audiogenic seizures and S(+) -losigamone dose-dependently (5, 10 and 20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) significantly inhibited clonic/tonic convulsions with 91 % of the mice protected at 20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1. There was no protection at 20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 with R(−) -losigamone. These results, from both in vitro and in vivo experiments, confirm that the pharmacological activity profiles of the two <b>losigamone</b> enantiomers are not identical and suggest further that excitatory amino acid-mediated processes are involved in the mode of action of S(+) -losigamone whereas R(−) -losigamone does not possess such properties. For the treatment of neurological conditions involving exaggerated excitatory amino acid function the use of S(+) -losigamone might therefore be more effective clinically than <b>losigamone</b> or its R(−) -enantiomer...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} members of a new class anticonvulsants, the tetronic acid derivatives, were studied in 3 in vitro models of epileptogenesis in rat hippocampal slices; the picrotoxin, the low {{magnesium}} and the low calcium model. The effects of AO 33 (<b>losigamone)</b> and AO 78 on stimulus−induced decreases in extracellular calcium concentration were also investigated. In all 3 models of epileptogenesis, both drugs blocked spontaneous and reduced stimulus−induced epileptiform discharges dose dependently and reversibly. Stimulus−induced changes in [Ca 2 +] 0 were markedly diminished by these agents. The fact that the tetronic acid derivatives block the low Ca seizure−like events which develop independently from chemical synaptic transmission suggests that these agents have non−synaptic or direct membrane actions with subsequently reduced cellular excitabilit...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe GABAA {{receptor}} (GABAAR) {{is a major}} {{target of}} antiseizure drugs (ASDs). A variety of agents that act at GABAARs s are used to terminate or prevent seizures. Many act at distinct receptor sites determined by the subunit composition of the holoreceptor. For the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and loreclezole, actions at the GABAAR are the primary or only known mechanism of antiseizure action. For topiramate, felbamate, retigabine, <b>losigamone</b> and stiripentol, GABAAR modulation {{is one of several}} possible antiseizure mechanisms. Allopregnanolone, a progesterone metabolite that enhances GABAAR function, {{led to the development of}} ganaxolone. Other agents modulate GABAergic “tone” by regulating the synthesis, transport or breakdown of GABA. GABAAR efficacy is also affected by the transmembrane chloride gradient, which changes during development and in chronic epilepsy. This may provide an additional target for “GABAergic” ASDs. GABAAR subunit changes occur both acutely during status epilepticus and in chronic epilepsy, which alter both intrinsic GABAAR function and the response to GABAAR-acting ASDs. Manipulation of subunit expression patterns or novel ASDs targeting the altered receptors may provide a novel approach for seizure prevention...|$|E
40|$|The {{hippocampus}} plays {{a crucial}} role in processing information from our environment. For communication with the cortex, it uses network oscillations, which encode for temporal elements of information and attach cognitive experiences, which we percieve and can even recall later from our memory. Especially gamma and theta oscillations go together and complement each other in this context. That is what makes them essential for processing, saving and recalling information. They not only depend on GABA-ergic and Glutamat-ergic mechanisms, but also on non-synaptic mechanisms and can be induced in vitro pharmacologically and by stimulation. In vivo, they occure not only physiologically, but also pathologically such as in epilepsy. Moreover oscillations can be looked at as intrinsic cell properties and messuerd as resonance and membrane potential oscillations. For shaping resonance or membrane potential oscillations those cells need ion-currents such as the M-current, h-current, or the persistent sodium current which regulate excitability of cells and can lead in case of dysfunction to pathology. In this work extracellular field potential recordings were used in adult rat hippocampal slices to verify the hypothesis that also intrinsic properties of hippocampal neurons contribute to network oscillations. Kainate application (100 nM) induced network theta frequency oscillations in coronal slices as well as network gamma frequency oscillations in horizontal slices. We tested for effects of the IM blocker XE 991, the IM enhancer Retigabine and Icagen- 110381, the INaP blocker <b>Losigamone</b> and the Ih inhibitor ZD 7288. Except ZD 7288 all substances suppressed both γ-and θ-Oszillationen which leads us to the assumption that besides synaptic interactions also intrinsic properties of neurones are important for sustaining oscillations in the hippocampus. Transferred from this in vitro setting to the pathologies in humans it might be possible that cognitive impairment in humans also results from instabilities in mambrane potentials. For this reason it seems meaningful {{to take a closer look}} at the identification of further ion-channels that might be involved in the genaration of membrane potential oscillations in order to develop efficiant drugs...|$|E
