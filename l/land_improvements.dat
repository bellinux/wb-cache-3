Multiple jurisdictions may tax the same property. There are three general varieties of property: <b>land,</b> <b>improvements</b> to land (immovable man-made things, e.g. buildings) and personal property (movable things). Real estate or realty is the combination of land and improvements to land.|$|E

He understands the rôle of banking, finance, investment and consumer credit in economic growth of a nation. Aziz presided the strong banking sector, unprecedented investment and growth finance sectors in Pakistan to underpin its economy. He strengthened capital availability, an essential and increasingly important economic input, in addition to labour and <b>land</b> <b>improvements.</b> With higher education budget up 15-fold and overall education spending up 36% in two years, he focused on education to improve the availability of skilled labour to fill new jobs.|$|E

However, he was intercepted by the Indian Affair's Representative, Bartlett, who asked Vandusen to see the Certificates of Sale. He handed Catherine's documents to Bartlett who stole the Certificates and the money, informing Vandusen that Indians {{were not allowed to}} buy land. It was at this point that Catherine and William approached Richard T. Pennefather, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, for her annuities and for the money spent on the house, barn and improvements on their land as other native people had received their Annuities and compensation for their <b>land</b> <b>improvements.</b> These annuities only amounted to $10.00 semi annually because of the dishonest handling of the funds.|$|E
40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>improvement</b> districts {{originally}} {{started as}} organizations after World War II: They {{are in charge}} of construction and operation of irrigation and drainage facilities, Development of agricultural land, reclamation from sea water, reclamation by filling, Recovery from disaster, exchange and consolidation of agricultural land and so on. As the Main construction projects were completed, the purpose of <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> districts Has shifted from facilities construction to operation and maintenance of them. However, the recent social situation has brought great changes in circumstance to <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> districts. In both urban and agricultural areas around local cities, urbanization has progressed so rapidly and widely that agricultural land has decreased through conversion into urban use. That causes pollution of irrigated water and difficulties in maintenance of <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> facilities. In rural moutainous areas, on the other hand, excess Depletion in population has occurred, causing difficulties in proper maintenance of Agricultural <b>land</b> and <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> facilities, which eventually increases the danger of natural disaster. Also, in other agricultural areas, the decline in agriculture of this country has degraded the quality of the production and living environments. This work was conducted to analyze the present situations of <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> Districts in differing geographical and social conditions, and to discuss the problems Surrounding them. Through such discussion, we pointout some possible remedies which Might improve the situation...|$|R

500|$|Continuing land {{reclamation}} {{and control of}} the Parrett was a long-running cycle of neglect followed by improvement. Work was carried out on the upper River Parrett basin in the Middle Ages by Glastonbury Abbey. Abbot Michael's survey of 1234 showed [...] of meadow recovered around the [...] "island" [...] of Sowy; from the accounts in the Abbey's rent books, this had increased to [...] by 1240. Flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed in the 13th century by building a number of embankment walls to contain the Parrett. These included Southlake Wall, Burrow Wall and Lake Wall. The River Tone was also diverted by the Abbot of Athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel, joining the Parrett upstream from its original confluence. After the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century, much of the former abbey lands came {{under the control of the}} Crown, particularly King's Sedgemoor, which had been wholly owned by Glastonbury Abbey, with Henry VI's Courts of Sewers made responsible for maintaining existing drainage and various Commissions made responsible for <b>land</b> <b>improvements.</b> Further reclamation work was carried out over the next 500years. In 1597, [...] of land were recovered near the Parrett estuary; a few years later [...] near Pawlett were recovered by means of embankments; three further reclamations, totalling , were undertaken downstream of Bridgwater by 1660. Kings James I, Charles I, and Charles II continued to improve King's Sedgemoor.|$|E
2500|$|Under the First Wilson Government, {{subsidies}} for farmers were increased. Farmers {{who wished to}} leave the land or retire became eligible for grants or annuities if their holdings were sold for approved amalgamations, and could receive those benefits whether they wished to remain in their farmhouses or not. A Small Farmers Scheme was also extended, and from 1 December 1965, 40,000 more farmers became eligible for the maximum £1,000 grant. New grants to agriculture also encouraged the voluntary pooling of smallholdings, and in cases where their land was purchased for non-commercial purposes, tenant-farmers could now receive double the previous [...] "disturbance compensation." [...] A Hill Land Improvement Scheme, introduced by the Agriculture Act of 1967, provided 50% grants {{for a wide range}} of <b>land</b> <b>improvements,</b> along with a supplementary 10% grant on drainage works benefitting hill land. The Agriculture Act 1967 also provided grants to promote farm amalgamation and to compensate outgoers.|$|E

50|$|Many tax systems {{prescribe}} longer depreciable {{lives for}} buildings and <b>land</b> <b>improvements.</b> Such lives may vary {{by type of}} use. Many such systems, including the United States and Canada, permit depreciation for real property using only the straight line method, or a small fixed percentage of cost. Generally, no depreciation tax deduction is allowed for bare land. In the United States, residential rental buildings are depreciable over a 27.5 year or 40 year life, other buildings over a 39 or 40 year life, and <b>land</b> <b>improvements</b> over a 15 or 20 year life, all using the straight line method.|$|E
50|$|Land {{improvement}} and land development are general terms {{that in some}} contexts may include infrastructure, but {{in the context of}} a discussion of infrastructure would refer only to smaller scale systems or works that are not included in infrastructure, because they are typically limited to a single parcel of land, and are owned and operated by the land owner. For example, an irrigation canal that serves a region or district would be included with infrastructure, but the private irrigation systems on individual land parcels would be considered <b>land</b> <b>improvements,</b> not infrastructure. Service connections to municipal service and public utility networks would also be considered <b>land</b> <b>improvements,</b> not infrastructure.|$|E

40|$|With EU accession, Romania {{must comply}} with {{policies}} and directives related to agriculture and rural development, and adapt to it' s own legislation and agricultural policy. According to EU policies and directives, Romania oriented his own policy toward farms and various forms of their association, as the main beneficiaries of state aid for agriculture and hence for irrigation. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to characterize the Romanian national strategies for <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> in the context of conditioning aid application to the recovery of the costs of water services including those relating to the environment. There are also presented the reality of the Romanian agricultural <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> sector in general and of the Covurlui Plateau agricultural <b>land</b> <b>improvement,</b> in particular. Considering the real issues of <b>land</b> <b>improvement</b> sector in Romania we conclude that it can not take full account of the principle of cost recovery from the direction of Irrigation beneficiaries (farmers and their associations), so long as the alternative would be the destruction of Irrigation and fall of agricultural activity in Romania...|$|R
