40|$|Aim of this {{research}} was to evaluate the slaughter data {{and the quality of the}} carcasses of <b>light</b> <b>lambs</b> reared in the Abruzzo Region. Forty Appenninica or Bergamasca x Appenninica lambs, half males and half females, from 4 farms of the Teramo Province, traditionally raised on milk and farm feeds and hay, were slaughtered at 60 d of age (20 kg ± 3, 37). Carcass traits (slaughter weight, dressing out percentage, pelt, full gastrointestinal tract and lights weight) were registered and carcasses were classified following Reg. CEE n. 2137 / 92 and n. 461 / 93. Results show a high variability of data, being 20. 5 % of the carcasses over 13 kg, border weight for <b>light</b> <b>lambs.</b> Dressing out percentage was unpredictable and not consistent with live weight as an effect of the high variability in pelt and digestive tract incidence.

Although lambs of investigated breeds were similar for slaughter age (2. 5 months), Dalmatian Pramenka had significantly higher carcass weights (CW; P< 0. 05). Breed had a significant influence on moisture and fat contents, whilst mineral composition (with the exception of selenium) was scarcely affected by breed and sex. Fat and moisture contents were significantly correlated with cold CW.

40|$|The {{effects of}} grazing on the {{carcasses}} and meat of <b>light</b> <b>lambs</b> are unclear, mainly due to variations in weather conditions and pasture production, which affect {{the growth of}} lambs {{and the quality of}} their carcasses. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of feeding systems, which varied in intensification due to the use of concentrate, on the growth and carcass traits of <b>light</b> <b>lambs</b> and the capability of these feeding systems to produce homogeneous lamb carcasses over the course of several years. The average daily weight gain of grazing lambs, but not lambs fed indoors was affected over years. The colour of the Rectus abdominis muscle and the amount of fat were more variable in grazing lambs (from 2. 7 to 6. 3) than indoor lambs (from 4. 5 to 5. 1). Grazing feeding systems without concentrate supplementation are more dependent than indoor feeding systems on the year. This climatologic dependence could lead to slaughter of older grazing lambs (77 days) to achieve the target slaughter weight when temperatures are low or the rainfall great. All feeding systems evaluated produced <b>light</b> <b>lambs</b> carcasses with a conformation score from O to R – that is required by the market. Even the potential change in fat colour found in both grazing treatments was not enough to change the subjective evaluation of fat colour.

In experiment 1, 6 - 7 months old Karayaka male lambs (7 light and 7 heavy) were used. Sugar beet pulp, perennial ryegrass and alfalfa straw were used to feed lambs in the research lasting for 28 days. In experiment 2, 7 - 8 months old Karayaka male lambs (7 light and 7 heavy) were used. The ground barley, wheat bran, expeller cottonseed meal and alfalfa straw were used to feed. The second experiment was continued for 42 days. In roughage selection, heavy lambs consumed more feed (54 %) than <b>light</b> <b>lambs</b> in total consumption (experiment 1). Besides, the Sugar beet pulp and alfalfa straw consumption of heavy lambs were higher than that of <b>light</b> <b>lambs</b> 64 and 30 %, respectively.

For each breed, animals were divided into 3 groups (8 BB and 7 SS breed, each) by live weight (LW). Two groups were conducted on rotational grazing of barley grass (GB) or perennial ryegrass (GR) and received daily 350 g of concentrate per lamb. The last group was conducted on feedlot system (FL) with 450 g of ryegrass hay and 650 g of the same concentrate per lamb per day. The whole grass yield was 5 t DM/ha for ryegrass prairie and 4. 2 for barley one. The final LW was higher for GB and GR lambs (28. 3 kg) than for FL ones (26. 9 kg). Irrespective to breed, the average daily gain was higher for both grazing groups than FL system, 144, 137 and 121 g for GR, GB and FL regimes, respectively. Slaughter LW was higher for BB (29. 0 kg) than SS breed (26. 5 kg). Barbarine lambs had more fat (23 vs. 17 %) and less muscle (53 vs. 57 %) than SS ones. FL lambs carcasses were more adipose (26 %) than those of both grass groups (18 %), while grass lambs had more muscle (57 vs. 51 %).

For that purpose, in April 2017, a total of 70 lambs of Travnik pramenka sheep were slaughtered, of which 48 male and 22 female. The lambs of Travnik pramenka sheep were raised on a family farm in Velika Peratovica, Bjelovar-Bilogora County. At age between 90 and 100 days lambs were individually weighed and slaughtered. After slaughter and standard procedures of processing, the carcasses and investigated organs were measured. The average slaughter weight of lambs measured immediately before slaughter was 21. 85 kg, considering that male lambs had statistically significant (P< 0. 05) higher slaughter weight than female (22. 47 kg : 20. 38 kg). The average lamb carcass weight of 11. 04 kg was determined, which was statistically significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in male (11. 32 kg) compared to female lamb carcass (10. 42). Although the dressing percentage of female lambs (51. 04 %) was higher than that found in male Travnik lambs (50. 33 %) the difference was not statistically significant.

In the sire breed trial, Shropshire (n� 5) and Ryeland (n� 4) rams were compared as sires of meat lambs with Suffolk, Oxford Down, Texel and Dorset Down rams at two farms (total lambs marketed: n� 732). At the ®rst farm, lambs sired by the Ryeland and the Shropshire made poorer prices than those sired by the Suffolk and Oxford Down, because of small size and low {{price per kg}} respectively. At the second farm, the Ryeland and Dorset Down performed similarly in respect of days to slaughter, carcase weight and sale price.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of sex and slaughter weight of Istrian sheep lambs on pH value and meat colour. The study included 118 lambs of both sexes (64 male and 54 female) which were, prior slaughter, divided into two groups: light (17. 76 kg; 28 male and 32 female) and heavy (20. 17 kg; 3 male and 22 female). Carcass weight was determined immediately after carcass processing and after 24 hours, while the pH value and meat colour were determined 45 minutes and 24 hours after slaughter.

The third group was bred indoors by Concentrate feed (C). At {{the end of the}} experiment, lambs from group C were heavier (48. 04 vs 28. 13 and 24. 23 kg pre-slaughter). After slaughter, carcasses from SA and W groups were leaner (14. 38 and 11. 63 vs 23. 93 kg after cooling). Samples of longissimus dorsi (LD) were removed and analyzed. The results showed much fat in meat from group C (16. 44 vs 6. 87 and 5. 89 %) (P< 0. 001). The percentages of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in meat from grazing lamb were higher (7. 01 and 8. 71 vs 5. 05 %) (P< 0. 05). All PUFA n- 3 in meat from pasture have promoted significant amounts (2. 07 and 2. 67 vs 0. 41 %) (P< 0. 001), most importantly in terms of C 18 : 3 n- 3 (ALA) (1. 16 and 1. 42 vs 0. 2 %) (P< 0. 001) while there was no significance for C 18 : 2 n- 6 (LA) (3. 40 and 3. 94 vs 3. 40 %).

40|$|The Istrian Milk sheep is an {{endangered}} breed of the Pramenka group {{raised in the}} North-Adriatic Karst region. Carcass and meat characteristics of 46 suckling, 6 - to 14 - week-old intact male <b>light</b> <b>lambs</b> from two feeding systems were analysed. Thirty-two lambs were raised in a flock fed only with forage (hay supplied in stall during winter or fresh herbage directly grazed during the other seasons). The lambs had free access to the forage supplied to their dams (feeding sys- tem: milk and forage; MF). The other fourteen suckling ovine were grown on a farm with a feeding system incorporat- ing a concentrated supply of the forage base. The lambs were stabled and creep fed on a concentrate (20 % CP) at a daily rate of 100 g/head, {{in addition to the}} suckled milk (feeding system: milk and concentrate; MC). The carcasses were divid- ed into three categories of weight, following the Community scale of <b>light</b> <b>lambs</b> classification: A (lesser than or equal to 7 kg, n= 17), B (7. 1 - 10 kg, n= 15) and C (10. 1 - 13 kg, n= 14). The frequency of 1 st quality carcasses increased with carcass weight, reaching 100 % in category C. On average, 72 % of the carcasses were scored as 1 st quality, without significant differences between feeding systems. The lightness of lamb meat from A carcasses was higher than that from the heaviest ones. Cooking losses showed a pattern opposite to that of pH (mean 5. 44; SE 0. 058), increasing where pH decreased (cate- gories A and B and concentrate-fed lambs). Shear force values were significantly affected by factors linked to the feed- ing system; in fact, MC lambs provided more tender meat than MF ones (32. 6 vs 46. 6 N). As carcass weight increased, moisture concentration decreased steadily (from 77. 8 % to 75. 5 %), while lipid content increased progressively (from 1. 58 % to 3. 14 %). In agreement with these patterns, the contribution of individual fatty acids (FA) to muscle weight gen- erally increased with carcass weight. A similar trend was observed for the relative concentration of saturated FA and monounsaturated FA, while that of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) showed an opposite evolution. The feeding system modi- fied the relationship between ω 3 and ω 6 PUFA series: with respect to MC meat, MF meat presented a higher content of linolenic acid and its long chain ω 3 derivatives and a lower content of linoleic acid and its major product, arachidonic acid. As a consequence, MF lambs furnished meat with a ω 3 /ω 6 ratio and an index of thrombogenicity more favourable for human health than those from MC lambs...|$|E

The importance of growth of this breed is due to aesthetic and commercial value of skins and their default color. Research has been conducted in three traditional growth counties of Karakul breed, respectively Iaşi, Botoşani and NeamŃ. Since the type Karakul sheep production is subject to official control for a large variety of colors, the investigations were taken into account only the basic colors.

40|$|Developmental {{programming}} {{is the concept}} that environmental factors, particularly during foetal life, can alter development, metabolism and physiology of an organism and this can have consequences later in life. There is growing interest in developmental programming in livestock species, particularly effects of maternal pregnancy nutrition, which is easy to manipulate. Recent research, using a sheep model, has shown that milk production in ewe offspring may be susceptible to maternal nutritional programming, such that over nutrition (ad libitum) of the pregnant dam, compared with maintenance nutrition, may impair their first lactation performance and result in the weaning of <b>lighter</b> <b>lambs.</b> The present study however revealed that maternal nutritional programming effects on lactation performance in ewe offspring did not persist over their productive lifetime. In a new study, the critical programming period was narrowed down to early gestation, coinciding with early mammogenesis in the foetus. In this study only twin-­‐born ewes were examined due to their economic significance in commercial sheep production and due to their increased susceptibility to nutritional insult in-­‐utero. It was revealed that, in addition to over nutrition (ad libitum), under-­‐nutrition (sub-­‐maintenance) of the dam during early pregnancy also impaired first lactation performance of twin-­‐born ewe offspring when compared with maintenance. Transcriptomics analysis using RNA-­‐seq identified that nutritional programming affects late pregnancy mammogenesis, rather than secretory cell function during lactation, in ewe offspring during their first parity. Ewes born to ad libitum-­‐fed dams, in particular, appeared to have impaired regulation of cell cycle while ewes born to sub-­‐maintenance-­‐fed dams had reduced expression of genes associated with the extracellular matrix, both of which may influence cell proliferation. As a consequence, both ewes born to ad libitum and sub-­‐maintenance-­‐fed dams may have had fewer mammary secretory cells, resulting in reduced lactation performance. The findings of this thesis indicate that differences in first-­‐lactation performance of ewe offspring, {{as a result of}} maternal nutritional programming, may be mediated by impaired proliferation of secretory epithelial cells. These findings contribute to our knowledge of the mechanisms of developmental programming of the mammary gland and presents a platform for future investigations which may ultimately lead to the ability to manage and manipulate lactation performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{slaughter}} season (winter and spring) and the age at slaughter (45 and 60 days) on the carcass characteristics and physico-chemical quality of meat were inves-tigated on 40 Leccese lambs. In each season, 20 lambs were subdivided into two groupscorresponding to the experimental ages. All lambs received maternal milk and a supple-mentation of hay and commercial concentrate from 30 days to slaughter. The ewes werefed a basal mixed diet (unifeed) and commercial concentrate and were allowed to graze for 5 h a day on polyphytic cultivated grassland. The increase of the lambs’ slaughter age from 45 to 60 days resulted in an improvement in live weight, some commercial cuts (shoulderand loin), {{the majority of the}} carcass measurements, adiposity and conformation of shoul-der and leg and the muscle/fat ratio. Intramuscular collagen properties were also affectedby slaughter age.

The daily feeding ration of the ewes consisted of haylage (2. 5 kg/ewe), meadow hay (ad libitum) and organic mineral lick (ad libitum). The genotype (G) and the sex (S) had not a significant effect on growth of lambs in the period from birth till the slaughter. On the other hand the litter size (LS) had a highly significant effect on this trait, whilst the highest daily gain in above-mentioned period was found in singles (157 g).

40|$|The total sheep {{population}} in Greece currently numbers about 9 million animals producing annu-ally 670 000 tons {{of milk and}} 82 000 tons of meat (Faostat, 2004). The sheep meat accounts for 18 % of the total meat production {{of the country and}} 7. 8 % of that of EU. The sheep meat consumption per capita is the highest in the EU countries (~ 14 kg). All the Greek local sheep are dual-purpose (milk and meat) animals. The milk-fed lamb carcasses (<b>light</b> <b>lambs)</b> are dominant (65 – 70 %) in the total sheep meat production. Every year about 6 mil-lion young lambs are slaughtered, immediately after weaning, at the age of 30 – 60 days. So the carcass weight, like in the other Mediterranean countries of Europe, is much lower (6 – 10 kg) in comparison with that of the countries of Central and Northern Europe. The low slaughter weight is due above all to the traditional preference of consumers for meat of young animals considering it to be of better qual-ity (Bernabeu et al., 2005). This choice also tends to be favoured by the traditional farming systems where the farmers often prefer to get rid of lambs as soon as possible considering lamb production as a by-product of lactation (Arsenos and Zygoyiannis, 2005). On the other hand, there are objective rea-sons for this situation that are related with the high-er proportion of fat in the heavier lamb carcasses which characterizes the unimproved dual-purpose sheep breeds (Tzalis et al., 1994). The fat in these carcasses is more saturated at the same time (Cifuni et al., 2000). The production of heavier carcasses with accept-able quality for consumers could undoubtedly be advantageous for producers by providing higher Effect of age at slaughter on carcass characteristics and carcass composition in lambs of mountain Greek breed...|$|E
5000|$|When Stead {{was only}} halfway done, she hit a wall: she {{wondered}} if she had focused the novel too much on her own personal life and problems. By her 40th birthday in January 2008, she had stopped writing. One week after her birthday celebration, Stead went to a writers' conference where the presenter advised attendees to stop thinking and just write. This speech worked as an antidote to Stead's writer's block; she started working on When You Reach Me again. After she had written two-thirds of the novel, Stead sent the draft to her editor Wendy Lamb at Random House. Perusing the script, Lamb found herself absorbed and wanted to help develop the book. Unlike Stead's debut novel First <b>Light,</b> which <b>Lamb</b> heavily edited, Lamb modified nothing on the first draft of When You Reach Me. Throughout the process, Stead helped Lamb understand the complicated concepts in the book and had drafts read by others to make sure [...] "revision hadn't created any holes or contradictions in the plot".|$|R

Inhomogeneous waves are involved in the problem if the incidence angle θ is greater than the first critical angle θ_c. In this case, the energy is transmitted {{from one side to the}} other by the coupling of two inhomogeneous waves with conjugate wavenumbers and the same kind of polarization, whereas each of these latter inhomogeneous waves does not transfer energy through the plate. Thus, nonstandard upgoing and downgoing waves are defined such that, firstly, their power fluxes are upgoing and downgoing, respectively, and, lastly, their interaction energy is zero. In this <b>light,</b> any <b>Lamb</b> wave can be considered as the result of interferences of upgoing and downgoing waves, as well-known for θ angle of incidence /frequency ": the quasi-energy brought by the incident harmonic plane wave crosses the plate without any conversion to reflected waves either at the first interface or at the second interface.

40|$|Thirty-six mature {{purebred}} cheviot ewes and 36 polypaysired wether lambs {{were used}} in two separate experiments to determine the usefulness of an electronic feeding door as contrasted with traditional feeding situations. The sheep were stratified by weight into three management categories; group housing and feeding (G+G), individual housing and feeding (1 + 1), or group housing and individual feeding (G+ 1) using an electronic feeding door. The weight stratification formed a light and a heavy weight class resulting in a 3 x 2 factorial design. Two different training procedures were used {{to arrive at a}} generalized 14 -day training sequence that does not require physical handling of the sheep. No differences were observed in learning behavior with older ewes or with sufficiently large lambs. During a 56 day immediate pre-slaughter feeding period for the lambs, average daily gain was. 23 kg, average daily feed consumption was 2. 12 kg, feed efficiency was 9. 08, carcass dressing percent was 43. 6, yield grade was 3. 3, and all but three lambs graded USDA Choice. Management category had no significant effect on these performance measures, with the exception that (G+ 1) lambs consumed more (P 3 ̆c. 05) feed (2. 20 kg) than (1 + 1) lambs (2. 05 kg). However, this consumption difference was not correlated to weight gain or feed efficiency. Weight class (light vs. heavy) had no effect on the changes that occurred during the trial although significant differences existed in regards to the magnitude of the actual body weights and condition scores. Heavy weight class lambs remained consistently heavier than <b>light</b> <b>lambs</b> throughout the trial. A significant effect of week was observed over the last eight weeks on both weight gain and feed consumption.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to improve the fatty acid profile of meat from light lamb, {{frequently}} reared in Spain and in other Mediterranean countries. A total of 44 <b>light</b> <b>lambs</b> fed different n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids sources were studied: control (C) (palm oil), extruded linseed (L), extruded linseed mixed with microalgae (LM) and fish oil (FO). The productive performance from 14. 7 to 26. 2 kg of live weights and meat quality characteristics during refrigerated storage were assessed. Lambs fed FO showed lower feed intake (p < 0. 001), average daily gain (p < 0. 001) and higher feed conversion ratio (p < 0. 001) than lambs from the other treatments. Fish oil meat had the lowest (p < 0. 01) protein proportion and the highest (p < 0. 001) C 20 : 5 n- 3, C 22 : 5 n- 3 and C 22 : 6 n- 3 proportions, while L or LM produced the highest (p < 0. 001) C 18 : 3 n- 3 deposition. Fish oil meat had higher (p < 0. 05) L* and lower (p < 0. 001) a* than meats from the other treatments. After 7 days of storage, FO meat showed the highest TBARS (p < 0. 001), while C meat showed similar value to 0 days of storage. Additionally, FO underwent higher microbial growth after 7 days of storage {{as compared to the}} other treatments. Dietary supplementation with L and LM leads to C 18 : 3 n- 3 meat enrichment and to a microbial load and colour characteristics similar to those of C, without adverse effect on lamb performance.

Lambs from AR in comparison with TR were of lower quality as assessed {{on the basis of}} fatty acids (FAs) profile. The content of conjugated linolic acid (CLA) in the fat of TR lambs was severalfold higher (0. 749 vs. 0. 193 g. 100 g- 1 FAME, P< 0. 001) than in AR lambs. Similarly, the content of trans-vaccenic (TVA), á-linolenic (ALA), rumenic (RA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was in TR lambs significantly higher (P< 0. 001) than in AR lambs (0. 955 vs. 0. 111; 0. 715 vs. 0. 251; 0. 672 vs. 0. 148; 0. 352 vs. 0. 061; 0. 252 vs. 0. 079 g. 100 g- 1 FAME). In contrary, the content of linoleic acid (LA), the ratio of LA/ALA and n- 6 /n- 3 in AR lambs was higher than in TR lambs (9. 07 vs. 4. 81 g. 100 g- 1 FAME; 39. 11 vs. 6. 80; 14. 56 vs. 3. 25, P< 0. 001).

40|$|In {{the first}} 3 days of life, triplet lambs, {{especially}} the smaller triplets, are less capable of surviving than twins and singles. However, whether differences in behaviour and survival of lambs within triplet litters persist after this period is unknown. This trial examined {{the differences in}} sucking behaviour and milk intake between the light, medium and heavy lambs within a triplet litter at 8 - 17 days of age, with the lamb rank based on birth weight. Of 28 triplet carrying ewes, only 10 complete litters survived to at least 8 days of age and {{could be used for}} this trial. After 4 hours of separation, the lambs were returned to the ewe and the behaviour of the lambs and ewe was observed for a period of 15 minutes. The abdominal girth and body weight of the lambs were measured before and after the sucking period. At 8 - 17 days of age, triplet lambs still differed in terms of weight (P= 0. 001) and abdominal girth (P= 0. 002); the triplet <b>lambs</b> born <b>lightest</b> were still lightest and had the smallest abdominal girth. However, there were no statistical relationships between lamb rank and sucking behaviour. Light, medium and heavy lambs did not differ in the number of sucking bouts, number of attempted bouts, total sucking duration, mean sucking bout duration, relative sucking duration, teat fidelity or number of butts. Nor did lamb rank affect the behaviour of the ewes (kicks or butts, walking away from lambs) or measures of milk intake such as relative weight gain or girth gain. However, there was a tendency for lamb rank to have an effect on one measure of milk intake (weight gain) (P= 0. 09). The <b>lambs</b> that were <b>lightest</b> at birth tended to gain less weight during the observation period than heavier lambs, particularly those of medium birth weight. There was also a tendency for lamb rank to have an effect on relative girth gain (P= 0. 08). The <b>lambs</b> born <b>lightest</b> tended to gain more girth relative to their original girth than the heaviest lambs. The only measure of sucking behaviour that tended to differ with lamb rank was the frequency of teat switching (P= 0. 09); medium lambs tended to switch teats more often than the heaviest lambs. Overall, weight gain {{is likely to be the}} most accurate indicator of milk intake; based on this variable, <b>lambs</b> born <b>lightest</b> appear to have ingested less milk than their heavier siblings, despite the lack of differences in sucking behaviour. These <b>lambs</b> were still <b>lighter</b> and smaller at 8 - 17 days of age, suggesting that they had lower growth rates and potentially lower chances of survival. Further research should aim to determine whether ewes and lambs can adapt their sucking behaviour to cope with triplet litters, instead of twins or singles, or whether ewes should be selected for higher milk production. In addition, the effect of different management strategies (e. g. fostering or weaning of the <b>lightest</b> <b>lamb</b> or providing milk supplement) on triplet lambs’ milk intake, growth and survival should be tested...|$|R
