50|$|In November 2008, Richter began {{a series}} in which he applied ink {{droplets}} to wet paper, using alcohol and lacquer to extend and retard the ink's natural tendency to bloom and creep. The resulting November sheets are regarded as {{a significant departure from}} his previous watercolours in that the pervasive soaking of ink into wet paper produced double-sided works. Sometimes the uppermost sheets bled into others, generating a sequentially developing series of images. In a few cases Richter applied <b>lacquer</b> to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the sheet, or drew pencil lines across the patches of colour.|$|R
