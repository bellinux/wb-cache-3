50|$|<b>LIN</b> (<b>Local</b> <b>Interconnect</b> <b>Network)</b> is {{a serial}} network {{protocol}} used for communication between components in vehicles. The {{need for a}} cheap serial network arose as the technologies and the facilities implemented in the car grew, while the CAN bus was too expensive to implement for every component in the car. European car manufacturers started using different serial communication topologies, which led to compatibility problems.|$|R
50|$|A vehicle bus is a {{specialized}} internal communications network that interconnects components inside a vehicle (e.g. automobile, bus, train, industrial or agricultural vehicle, ship, or aircraft). Special requirements for vehicle control such as assurance of message delivery, of non-conflicting messages, of minimum time of delivery, of low cost, and of EMF noise resilience, {{as well as}} redundant routing and other characteristics mandate the use of less common networking protocols. Protocols include Controller Area Network (CAN), <b>Local</b> <b>Interconnect</b> <b>Network</b> (<b>LIN)</b> and others. Conventional computer networking technologies (such as Ethernet and TCP/IP) are rarely used, except in aircraft, where implementations of the ARINC 664 such as the Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet are used.

40|$|One of {{the first}} {{electronics}} components used in an automobile was the fuse. Additional features were developed such as engine management systems. These additional features increased the amount of wiring in a wiring harness. This contributed towards the necessity to develop the bus structure in the 1980 s. The de‐facto bus structure in the automotive industry became CAN (Controller Area Network). By using a bus structure this resulted in less hard wiring being required {{in the production of}} an automobile which further lead to a reduction in production cost. CAN is an event-triggered protocol which denotes it is non‐deterministic and it has a theoretical bandwidth limit of 1 Mbit. The practical limit is nearer 500 kbit. During the 80 ’s and 90 ’s, automotive electronics development increased; this was primarily driven by increased development of safety features such as ABS (Anti‐lock Braking System). The {{increase in the number of}} features and nodes caused increased traffic on the bus. The CAN protocol will be unable to meet the requirements for the extra applications. This resulted in the development of FlexRay in 2000 by a consortium originally consisting of amongst others BMW, Daimler Chrysler, Freescale and Philips. This protocol can implement both time‐triggered and event‐triggered messages, determinism, fault tolerance, redundancy and can operate at 10 Mbit. Newly developed technologies have high initial costs therefore being initially more expensive than established technologies. This could result in it being financially unworkable to replace a complete automotive bus with FlexRay. FlexRay can possibly be used for mission critical applications such as powertrain applications, while other protocols such as CAN and <b>LIN</b> (<b>Local</b> <b>Interconnect</b> <b>Network)</b> may possibly be used for less critical applications. The aim of this research is to design and develop a framework that allows the implementation of a CAN application on the FlexRay protocol, without degrading the applications performance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a <b>Local</b> <b>Interconnect</b> <b>Network</b> (<b>LIN)</b> integrated output driver circuit exhibiting a high degree of immunity against conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI). The transmitted signal of this driver is shaped with a predefined slope so as to reduce electromagnetic emission at higher frequencies. The effect of EMI coupling from the data bus into the driver circuit-is countered using a new feedback scheme which shields the slope shaping function from the output stage. Although the output signal may be heavily corrupted by EMI, the LIN driver continues to deliver an unaltered duty. cycle, which is mandatory to obtain an error-free data transmission.
