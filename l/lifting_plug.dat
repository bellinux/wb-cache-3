50|$|The body {{consists}} of a hollow steel shell containing high explosive (either TNT or Composition B) painted olive drab with yellow markings. A fuze adapter is screwed into the body and brazed in place. An eyebolt <b>lifting</b> <b>plug</b> is screwed into the fuze well to assist in transportation. The plug is removed and replaced with a fuze for firing. The complete projectile weighs 43.2 kg, is 800 mm long and contains 15.8% explosive by weight. It is a separate-loading projectile—propellant bags or MAC charges are loaded separately.|$|E
50|$|The 155 mm M549/M549A1 HERA is a separate-loading munition with {{a two-part}} forged shell body. The forward HE-filled shell body is {{constructed}} from high-fragmentation steel (HF1) and is of a low-drag aerodynamic profile. The rocket-motor body {{makes up the}} rear of the shell, this constructed from 4340 steel. The motor body weighs 13.5 kg (approximately 3.175 kg of which is propellant), is 266.7 mm long and is encircled by a welded overlay copper driving band and obturator band, both protected during storage and transit by a polycarbonate composition grommet. At the front of the projectile, the fuze cavity is protected during transport by an energy-absorbing <b>lifting</b> <b>plug,</b> which protects the fuze area from damage during storage, transit and handling. Before loading, the <b>lifting</b> <b>plug</b> is replaced by a fuze, and the protector cap over the rocket-motor nozzle is removed; the 155 mm M549/M549A1 HERA is not intended to be fired in the 'rocket-off' mode. On-target effects are enhanced by the shell's HF-1 steel body.The 155 mm M549 HERA forward shell body is filled with a nominal 7.26 kg of Composition B. The M549A1 HERA filler is 6.8 kg of cast TNT.At the instant of firing, the propellant gases ignite a pyrotechnic delay train in the rocket motor. The delay burns for approximately seven seconds. By the end of this seven seconds, the end of the delay train reaches the rocket's primary igniter and subsequently lights the motor's two propellant grains via an igniter pellet.|$|E
50|$|The M795 is a 155mm high {{fragmentation}} steel (HF1) body projectile {{filled with}} 23.8 lb of TNT and weighing approximately 103 lb. The high fragmentation steel body is encircled by a gilding metal rotating band making it compatible with 3W through 8S (M3A1 through M203A1) zone propelling charges across all current 155mm howitzers. The projectile is packaged {{on a metal}} pallet with a shock attenuating <b>lifting</b> <b>plug</b> and flexible rotating band cover. The M795 projectile is ballistically similar to the M483A1 family of cargo projectiles and {{may be used as}} a registration round for the M483A1 family. The M795 projectile provides an increased effectiveness against major ground force threats at greater ranges for anti-personnel and anti-materiel targets when compared to the current M107 projectile.|$|E
40|$|Report {{describes}} {{research on}} variable-reluctance electric-motor drive for eventual use in electric-vehicle propulsion. Primary design and performance criteria were torque and power {{output per unit}} mass of motor, cost, and drive efficiency. For each criterion, optimized drive design developed, and designs unified to yield single electric-vehicle drive. Scaled-down motor performed as expected.

500|$|The ASaC7s {{will remain}} in service until they are {{replaced}} under the [...] "Crowsnest" [...] programme; intended as a podded capability onboard Merlins. [...] Previous proposed replacement programmes, Future Organic Airborne Early Warning (FOAEW) and MASC (Maritime Airborne Surveillance and Control) were initiated and then cancelled, due largely to the erroneous assumption that the entire ASaC Mk7 system could simply be <b>lifted</b> and <b>plugged</b> into another aircraft type. [...] However, {{as a result of}} the time gap between the planned out of service date of the Sea King in 2016, and the introduction of [...] "Crowsnest" [...] seven Sea King ASaC.7 helicopters {{will remain in}} service with the RN through to the second half of 2018.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1920s, {{the line}} was closed for {{reconstruction}} and the depot {{was used as a}} working site for transporting spoil, equipment and works traffic {{in and out of the}} tunnels. The depot and lift were finally taken out of use at the end of 1924. The incline tunnel and the <b>lift</b> shaft were <b>plugged</b> on the surface and several blocks of flats were constructed on the old depot site by the LCC.

5000|$|Following run 13, {{an attempt}} was made to wash a fuel element in the wash cell. During the operation, an {{explosion}} occurred of sufficient magnitude to <b>lift</b> the shield <b>plug</b> out of the wash cell. It is believed the tetralin-related decomposition products caused a substantial amount of sodium to be trapped in the fuel rod elements by blocking drain holes. There were no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the wash-cell explosion. As a result of the explosion, no further washing of the elements was done. Measurements from within the reactor building indicated extremely high radioactivity levels throughout the building. Within several days radioactivity in the high bay had been reduced to normal levels, except for the area immediately around the wash cells.|$|R

I approached with trepidation after the opening Prelude but with an open mind or just an appreciation for the finer things in life Get Lifted could find itself being an essential album in anyone’s collection." [...] Paste gave it a positive review and stated that it [...] "has as much in common with the classic funk and soul of Isaac Hayes, Stevie Wonder and The Delfonics as it does with today’s best R&B, hip-hop and neo-soul." [...] The A.V. Club gave it an average review and stated that the album [...] "suffers from a surplus of slickness, but it's also seductive, and at just over 52 minutes, mercifully free from the excess and filler that characterize many rap and R&B albums." [...] Exclaim!, however, gave it an unfavorable review and said, [...] "The early line on Legend is that the heat this album will undoubtedly generate guarantees that Legend’s apparent fidelity issues will get worse before they get better. Get <b>Lifted</b> indeed." [...] <b>Plugged</b> In gave it a mixed review and stated that [...] "Legend is a talented singer and piano player but fails to maintain his moral focus. It doesn't take much profanity, infidelity and sexual inappropriateness to sink an otherwise decent effort." ...|$|R
40|$|The Assembly Transfer System (ATS) receives, cools, {{and opens}} rail and truck {{transportation}} casks from the Carrier/Cask Handling System (CCHS). The system unloads transportation casks consisting of bare Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) assemblies, single element canisters, and Dual Purpose Canisters (DPCs). For casks containing DPCs, the system opens the DPCs and unloads the SNF. The system stages the assemblies, transfer assemblies {{to and from}} fuel-blending inventory pools, loads them into Disposal Containers (DCs), temporarily seals and inerts the DC, decontaminates the DC and transfers it to the Disposal Container Handling System. The system also prepares empty casks and DPCs for off-site shipment. Two identical Assembly Transfer System lines are provided in the Waste Handling Building (WHB). Each line operates independently to handle the waste transfer throughput and to support maintenance operations. Each system line primarily consists of wet and dry handling areas. The wet handling area includes a cask transport system, cask and DPC preparation system, and a wet assembly handling system. The basket transport system forms the transition between the wet and dry handling areas. The dry handling area includes the dry assembly handling system, assembly drying system, DC preparation system, and DC transport system. Both the wet and dry handling areas are controlled by the control and tracking system. The system operating sequence begins with moving transportation casks to the cask preparation area. The cask preparation operations consist of cask cavity gas sampling, cask venting, cask cool-down, outer lid removal, and inner shield <b>plug</b> <b>lifting</b> fixture attachment. Casks containing bare SNF (no DPC) are filled with water {{and placed in the}} cask unloading pool. The inner shield plugs are removed underwater. For casks containing a DPC, the cask lid(s) is removed, and the DPC is penetrated, sampled, vented, and cooled. A DPC lifting fixture is attached and the cask is placed into the cask unloading pool. In the cask unloading pool the DPC is removed from the cask and placed in an overpack and the DPC lid is severed and removed. Assemblies are removed from either an open cask or DPC and loaded into assembly baskets positioned in the basket staging rack in the assembly unloading pool. A method called ''blending'' is utilized to load DCs with a heat output of less than 11. 8 kW. This involves combining hotter and cooler assemblies from different baskets. Blending requires storing some of the hotter fuel assemblies in fuel-blending inventory pools until cooler assemblies are available. The assembly baskets are then transferred from the basket staging rack to the assembly handling cell and loaded into the assembly drying vessels. After drying, the assemblies are removed from the assembly drying vessels and loaded into a DC positioned below the DC load port. After installation of a DC inner lid and temporary sealing device, the DC is transferred to the DC decontamination cell where the top area of the DC, the DC lifting collar, and the DC inner lid and temporary sealing device are decontaminated, and the DC is evacuated and backfilled with inert gas to prevent prolonged clad exposure to air. The DC is then transferred to the Disposal Container Handling System for lid welding. In another cask preparation and decontamination area, lids are replaced on the empty transportation casks and DPC overpacks, the casks and DPC overpacks are decontaminated, inspected, and transferred to the Carrier/Cask Handling System for shipment off-site. All system equipment is designed to facilitate manual or remote operation, decontamination, and maintenance. The system interfaces with the Carrier/Cask Handling System for incoming and outgoing transportation casks and DPCs. The system also interfaces with the Disposal Container Handling System, which prepares the DC for loading and subsequently seals the loaded DC. The system support interfaces are the Waste Handling Building System and other internal WHB support systems...|$|R
