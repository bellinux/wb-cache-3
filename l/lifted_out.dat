5|$|At 09:45, the US Embassy closed. There {{would be}} no {{diplomatic}} relations between the US and Cambodia again until 11 November 1991. By 10:41 all the evacuees including Ambassador Dean and President Saukham Khoy had been <b>lifted</b> <b>out</b> by helicopters of HMH-462. Helicopters of HMH-463 operating from the USS Hancock then began to land to extract the ground security force.|$|E
5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers to be relatively safely and conveniently <b>lifted</b> <b>out</b> of the water and returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, {{one of the}} TBMs {{completed}} its tunnel at the cavern. The second TBM broke through {{the wall of the}} cavern on July 15, 2010, completing its tunneling operation. The TBMs were partially disassembled and backed up to the 25th Street shaft, where they were <b>lifted</b> <b>out.</b> In April 2011, the MTA announced that the contract covering the tunnels, the 34th Street station mezzanine and passenger platform was 85% complete, and that the systems contract, covering mechanical and electrical systems, electric power, lighting and train tracks would be awarded by July 2011. A second entrance to the station is planned. In May 2012, the MTA announced that the extension, now 65% complete, had received the installation of the first set of rails.|$|E

25|$|<b>Lifting</b> <b>out</b> of {{the quarry}} {{required}} a hole {{to be made}} through the block so a cable could be inserted to pull the block away so other cables could be attached for <b>lifting</b> <b>out</b> of the quarry. The lifting was done with wooden derricks above {{and outside of the}} quarry or the 50-ton electric hoist if in Quarry 2 (which was Quarry 3 during the boom period of 1905 to 1916).|$|R
5|$|In {{the next}} five seasons, the Rockets either failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs or were {{eliminated}} in the first round. The first elimination in 1988 led to Fitch's dismissal, with Don Chaney replacing him as head coach. Chaney, like Olajuwon, also played for the Houston Cougars under Guy Lewis, having played along Elvin Hayes in the late 1960s. Chaney had his best season during 1990–91, where he was named the Coach of the Year after leading the Rockets to a 52-30 record despite Olajuwon's absence due to injury for 25 games. Despite Olajuwon's usual strong numbers, the underwhelming roster could not be <b>lifted</b> <b>out</b> of mediocrity. However, the attempts to rebuild the team nucleus incorporated players that would later make an impact in the years to come, such as Kenny Smith, Vernon Maxwell, Robert Horry, Mario Elie, Sam Cassell and Otis Thorpe.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} year of the operation, the massive scope of full {{excavation}} and raising was beginning to take its toll on those closely involved in the project. In May 1981, Alexander McKee voiced concerns about the method chosen for raising the timbers and openly questioned Margaret Rule's position as excavation leader. McKee felt ignored in what he viewed as a project where he had always played a central role, both as the initiator of the search for the Mary Rose and other ships in the Solent, and as an active member throughout the diving operations. He had several supporters who all pointed to the risk of the project's turning into an embarrassing failure if the ship were damaged during raising operations. To address these concerns it was suggested that the hull should be placed on top of a supporting steel cradle underwater. This would avoid the inherent risks of damaging the wooden structure if it were <b>lifted</b> <b>out</b> of the water without appropriate support. The idea of using nylon strops was also discarded in favour of drilling holes through the hull at 170 points and passing iron bolts through them to allow the attachment of wires connected to a lifting frame.|$|E
25|$|Continuous Flight Auger. A {{method of}} {{sampling}} using an auger as a corkscrew. The auger is screwed into the ground then <b>lifted</b> <b>out.</b> Soil is retained on the blades of the auger and kept for testing. The soil sampled this way is considered disturbed.|$|E

25|$|Another use of foils is {{to provide}} lift, turning the boat into a hydrofoil. Hydrofoils require {{significant}} speeds to work, but once the hull is <b>lifted</b> <b>out</b> of the water, the drag is significantly reduced.

25|$|The Thai mercenaries {{were trapped}} {{for ten days}} before their rescuers linked up and led {{them back to the}} improvised fire base. The Communists {{followed}} suit. Both Air America and the U.S. Air Force were loath to attempt an exfiltration because of potential ground fire. At that point, the Thai commander on scene parachuted into the fire base to show there was no ground fire. The 22nd Special Operations Squadron then <b>lifted</b> <b>out</b> troops and guns to end the operation.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{leadership}} of brigadier commander Wu Yunping of the 44th Airborne Brigade, troops advanced on the Monument and at about 4:40 am, shot out the students' loud speakers. By then, {{the majority of the}} students had been persuaded by Liu Xiaobo, Hou Dejian to leave the Square. The students left the Square to the southeast. Some were beaten by soldiers along the way. Army vehicles then ran over the tent city. By 5:30 am the Square was cleared. Debris was <b>lifted</b> <b>out</b> by helicopter.|$|E
25|$|During {{refuelling}} {{operations on}} Reactor 2, an {{irradiated fuel element}} failed to release from the grab (this is used to hold an element while it is withdrawn from a reactor). Routine methods were used to release the grab. However, the irradiated fuel element snagged during the operation and was <b>lifted</b> <b>out</b> of its shielding resulting in the operators on the pile cap being exposed to the intense radiation being emitted from the irradiated fuel element. Personnel responded quickly, and the radiological dose they received was small.|$|E

25|$|In a half-seat position, the rider's seat {{bones are}} <b>lifted</b> <b>out</b> of the saddle, {{and only the}} pelvis has contact. It is used for jumping when some seat aid may be necessary, {{especially}} for sharp turns, when riding downhills, on the approach to potentially spooky fences, or when the rider wishes to collect the stride. This seat is a compromise, allowing the jumping rider to have greater control than in two-point, but still keeping {{the majority of the}} rider's weight off the horse's back.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of wrap - {{stretchy}} and woven. Stretchy wraps are generally made of knits such as jersey or interlock. It is easy to take babies {{in and out of}} a stretchy wrap. This can be easier for the wearer as the sling often remains tied on and the baby is <b>lifted</b> <b>out</b> and put back in as required. Several factors influence stretchiness: carriers with any spandex or lycra content will tend to be very stretchy, carriers which are 100% cotton or other natural fibers will tend to have less lengthwise stretch.|$|E
25|$|The breaststroke, backstroke, {{and front}} crawl {{can all be}} swum easily even if the swimmer's {{technique}} is flawed. The butterfly, however, is unforgiving of mistakes in style; {{it is very difficult}} to overcome a poor butterfly technique with brute strength. Many swimmers and coaches consider it the most difficult swimming style. The main difficulty for beginners is the synchronous over-water recovery, especially when combined with breathing, since both arms, the head, shoulders and part of the chest have to be <b>lifted</b> <b>out</b> of the water for these tasks. Once efficient technique has been developed, it becomes a smooth, fast stroke.|$|E

25|$|Minimal {{surfaces}} have {{a simple}} interpretation in real life: they are the shape a soap film will assume if a wire frame shaped like the curve is dipped into a soap solution and then carefully <b>lifted</b> <b>out.</b> The {{question as to whether}} a minimal surface with given boundary exists is called Plateau's problem after the Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau who carried out experiments on soap films in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1930 Jesse Douglas and Tibor Radó gave an affirmative answer to Plateau's problem (Douglas was awarded one of the first Fields medals for this work in 1936).|$|E
25|$|Quarrying the Yule marble (3.9 {{miles south}} of Marble, Colorado by the Vermont Marble Company) was a one-year process {{beginning}} in 1930. The cap was quarried on the first attempt but the base required three tries. The large middle block also required three tries. In late January 1931, the 56 ton middle block was <b>lifted</b> <b>out</b> of the quarry. The quarrying involved 75 men. When the block was separated from the mountain inside the quarry it weighed 124 tons. A wire saw was then brought into the quarry to cut the block down to 56 tons.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after 9 A.M., {{with the}} {{submersible}} {{about to be}} <b>lifted</b> <b>out</b> of {{the water with a}} towline back onto the ship, a water alarm sounded in the aft sphere, a self-contained part of the submersible containing machinery and oil storage. The towline had apparently fouled on the aft sphere hatch and wrenched it open. With the sound of water entering the aft compartment, Pisces III became inverted and began to sink back to the seabed. The aft sphere was now fully flooded. The additional weight of water now added over a tonne of extra weight to the submersible.|$|E
