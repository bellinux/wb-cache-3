40|$|Various {{forms of}} land consolidation, which are today {{carried out in}} Yugoslavia, do not {{essentially}} differ from the usual type — the so called »classical land consolidation«.

50|$|The third {{container}} terminal at Port Botany {{was completed in}} June 2011. The 515 million project included the reclamation of 63 ha of <b>land</b> <b>with</b> the <b>construction</b> of 1.85 km of shipping wharves which will berth five vessels. In addition, there was associated rail and road networks. Baulderstone and Jan De Nul Joint Venture partners were awarded the Australian Construction Achievement Award, Australian construction industry’s most prestigious award, for their work on the project. In December 2009, Hutchison Whampoa invested in Terminal 3 through subsidiary Hutchison Port Holdings (and its wholly owned subsidiary Sydney International Container Terminals), signed a 30-year lease with Sydney Ports Corporation, now transferred to NSW Ports.

50|$|In {{this same}} month, the Penan tribes in Sarawak’s {{northern}} region set up blockades {{to prevent the}} implementation of a 500 km-long Sarawak-Sabah Gas Pipeline (SSGP). It is said that the SSGP will be built and operational by the end of 2010. It will allow natural gas sourced from Sabah’s offshore gas reserves to be delivered to the liquefied natural gas complex in Bintulu. This project particularly affects Penan communities as the SSGP will claim large tracts of their Native Customary Rights land. Furthermore, the laying of this pipeline is only one component of many, set for construction on the Penan’s <b>land,</b> <b>with</b> the <b>construction</b> of a proposed onshore Sabah Oil and Gas Terminal (SOGT) and a gas compression station due for completion in 2012.|$|R

It describes the development process of landed property - from agricultural land to urbanized <b>land</b> for <b>construction</b> <b>with</b> building permission. <b>Landed</b> property prices are analysed by the development stages and are based on The Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia's (Geodetska uprava Republike Slovenije - GURS) data. GURS divides landed property on agricultural land, urbanized land for construction (building ground), developed <b>land</b> and <b>land</b> <b>with</b> building permission. The results of the analysis of landed property prices by the development stages relate to the Republic of Slovenia, to individual statistical regions and to local communities.

50|$|In {{exchange}} for land cessions {{to the federal}} government, the Native Americans usually received annuities in cash and goods and an agreement to pay tribal debts. In some cases tribes were granted reservation lands for their use, salt, trinkets, and other gifts. Treaty provisions of land allotments to individuals and families and funds for fences, tools, and livestock were intended to help the Indians assimilate as farmers. Some treaties also provided assistance <b>with</b> <b>land</b> clearing, <b>construction</b> of mills, and provisions for blacksmiths, teachers, and schools.|$|R

30|$|Some {{scholars}} {{affirm that}} the main reason of difficulty in profit earning from metro sector is {{from the fact that}} the agents in the transaction cannot profit from the positive externalities. Thus, how to obtain returns for the positive externalities has become the core focus in building profit models. Two feasible methods proposed by Miao et al. [5] include government subsidies and authorization of property development rights to rail transit enterprises. The “metro operation[*]+[*]benefit return” profit model was put forward by Zhang et al. [6] where the former represented operation on metro lines and ancillary resources and the latter includes return of value-added benefit from real estate properties along the metro line. The development benefits from this model are increased by Zhang et al. [7] through cooperation with a real estate developer brand. Liu [8] identified three fundamental aspects, i.e., overall control of property operations along rail transit lines, interactive <b>land</b> development combined <b>with</b> <b>construction</b> of rail stations, and integrated connections with conventional bus transport. Likewise, Xue et al. [9] proposed that the integrated approach for profit models promotes benign development in urban rail transit. Song et al. [10] formed a later compensation mode for existing lines that is mainly subsidized by government and supplemented with property development, whereas an advanced compensation mode for new line projects includes integrated development on land resources and planned resources. Cooperation and a new approach between the informal and formal actors are crucial to generate profit in order to continue increasing the aggregate benefits of society.|$|R
