30|$|This paper {{presents}} a differential coupling wheelset (DCW) {{to solve the}} problems of poor curving performance for the conventional wheelset in the sharp curve and bad steering capability for the IRW in the <b>large</b> <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> and tangent line. In the DCW, both sides of IRWs are coupled by a clutch-type limited slip differential. In the tangent track, the clutch locks the differential, which does not permit a difference in rotation motion of the two wheels, and thus the DCW’s dynamic behavior {{is similar to that of}} a traditional wheelset. In curves with small radius, the clutch will unlock the differential, and the DCW’s dynamic performance is similar to that of a IRW; which can dramatically eliminate the sliding friction between wheel and rail, and reduce the wheel/rail wear and noise in sharp curves. Furthermore, due to the differential, the total rotation speed of two wheels keeps constant. Once the rotation speed of one wheel increases, another wheel decreases at the same time. This difference of rotation speed between two wheels generates a yaw motion for the DCW to negotiate the curves in the radial position to improve the curving performance of urban railway vehicles.|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. Sound {{pressure}} levels exceeding {{acceptable limits}} are being generated by trains travelling on the 1000 m radius curved railway line past {{the town of}} Elands Bay. Unacceptable sound levels are attributed mainly to top of rail wheel squeal. Top of rail wheel squeal belongs {{to the family of}} selfinduced vibrations and originates from frictional instability in curves between the wheel and the rail under predominantly saturated lateral creep conditions. In small radius curves, saturated lateral creep conditions occur due to the steering of railway wheelsets with large angles of attack. Given the large curve radius and the utilisation of self-steering bogies on the Sishen-Saldanha Iron Ore railway line, curve squeal is a highly unexpected result for the 1000 m radius curved railway line. This is because curving of bogies in large radius curves are achieved without high wheelset angles of attack leading to saturated creep conditions. An experimental and analytical investigation was carried out to identify the mechanisms influencing the generation of wheel squeal in large radius curves. Simultaneous measurement of sound pressure and lateral wheel-rail forces were made during regular train service in one of the two 1000 m radius curves at Elands Bay to characterise the bogie curving behaviour for tonal noise due to wheel squeal occurring in the <b>large</b> <b>radius</b> <b>curve.</b> The lateral force curving signature not only reveals the levels of lateral wheel-rail forces required for bogie curving, but also whether the bogie is curving by means of the creep forces generated at the wheel-rail interface only or if contact is necessitated between the wheel flange and rail gauge corner to help steer the bogie around the curve. The test set-up consisted of two free field microphones radially aligned at equivalent distances towards the in – and outside of the curve in line with a set a strain gauge bridges configured and calibrated to measure the lateral and vertical forces on the inner and outer rail of the curve. This test set-up allowed the squealing wheel to be identified from the magnitude difference of the sound pressures recorded by the inner and outer microphones in combination with comparing the point of frequency shift of the squeal event due to the Doppler Effect with the force signals of the radially aligned strain gauge bridges. From the experimental phase of the investigation, it was found that wheel squeal occurring in the 1000 m radius curve at Elands Bay is characteristic of empty wagons and is strongly related to the squealing wheel’s flange/flange throat being in contact with the gauge corner of the rail. Here high levels of spin creepage associated with high contact angles in the gauge corner lead to high levels of associated lateral creepage necessary for squeal generation. This is in contrast to lateral creepage due to high wheelset angles of attack being the key kinematic parameter influencing squeal generation in small radius curves. Furthermore, the amplitude of wheel squeal originating from the passing of empty wagons was found to be inversely proportional to the level of flange rubbing on the squealing wheel i. e. increased flange contact on the squealing wheel brings about a positive effect on squeal control. Contrary to the empty wagons which are characterised by tonal curve squeal, loaded 4 wagons requiring contact between the wheel flange and rail gauge corner in the 1000 m curve was characterised by broadband flanging noise. It was concluded from measurements that flange contact occurring under high lateral forces for steady state curving of loaded wagons provides the complete damping necessary for squeal control. The curve squeal noise that originated from the passing of empty wagons in the Elands Bay curve could further be classified according to the frequency at which the squeal event manifested itself in the curve, i. e. low frequency audible (0 – 10 kHz), high frequency audible (10 – 20 kHz) and ultrasonic squeal (> 20 kHz). The vast majority of low frequency audible squeal events recorded in the 1000 m Elands Bay curve occurred at approximately 4 kHz and originated from the low rail/trailing inner wheel interface, whilst the vast majority of high frequency audible squeal events occurred in the frequency range between 15 and 20 kHz and originated from both the high rail/leading outer wheel and low rail/trailing inner wheel interfaces...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} resolve the {{problems}} of conventional wheelset, many efforts have been made. For example, the semi-active and active actuation systems have been adopted to enhance the dynamic performance of railway vehicles [10, 11]. The independently rotating wheel (IRW) that decouples the wheelset is proposed to eliminate the hunting motion of the conventional wheelset and reduce the wheel/rail wear in sharp curves. The IRWs for railway vehicles have been investigated for many years. However, the use of IRW would also eliminate the guidance capability of the railway vehicles in <b>large</b> <b>radius</b> <b>curves</b> and tangent lines. Consequently, a compromise should be achieved between the curving performance in sharp curves and that in <b>large</b> <b>radius</b> <b>curves</b> and tangent lines by use of active controls like yaw control, creep control of damping, and stiff control.

Gretashel and Bose [15] investigated the separate drive motors with precise torque control to provide guidance and curving capability.

40|$|The {{equations}} {{governing the}} vertical {{structure of a}} stationary keplerian accretion disc are presented. The model {{is based on the}} alpha-viscosity, includes self-gravity, convective transport and turbulent pressure. A few properties of the model are discussed for circumstellar and AGN discs. We show the strong sensitivity of the disc structure to the viscous energy deposition towards the vertical axis, specially when entering inside the self-gravitating part of the disc. The local version of the alpha-prescription leads to a "singular" behavior which is also predicted by the vertically averaged model. With respect, a much softer transition is observed with the "alpha-P" formalism. Turbulent pressure is important only for alpha > 0. 1. It lowers vertical density gradients, significantly thickens the disc, tends to wash out density inversions and pushes the self-gravitating region to slightly <b>larger</b> <b>radii.</b> <b>Curves</b> localizing the inner edge of the self-gravitating disc as functions of the viscosity parameter and accretion rate are given. The lower alpha, the closer to the center the self-gravitating regime, and the sensitivity to the accretion rate is generally weak, except for alpha < 0. 1. This study suggests that models aiming to describe T-Tauri discs beyond about a few to a few tens astronomical units from the central protostar using the alpha-theory should consider vertical self-gravity. The Primitive Solar Nebula was probably a bit (if not strongly) self-gravitating at the actual orbit of giant planets. Alpha-discs hosted by active galaxies are self-gravitating beyond about a thousand Schwarzchild radii. The inferred surface density remains too high to lower the accretion time scale.

This was the first two-track section built on a line in Württemberg during its initial construction.The Royal Württemberg State Railways completed the section from Zuffenhausen to Ditzingen in 1868 and a year later the section to Weil der Stadt. The last and hardest part of the line between Weil der Stadt and Calw was not completed until 1872. It included a tight loop with a radius of 335 metres to pass by Hackenberg (hill) near Schafhausen. A loop built on a similar principle was built {{at the end of the}} line at Hirsau. Here it was necessary to overcome the large height difference between Calw and Althengstett by extending the line. The line runs through the valley of the Tälesbach, a tributary of the Nagold in an extended loop and then turns back and runs through the Hirsau Tunnel to the flank of the Nagold valley. That meant that trains running from Calw towards Althengstett, initially ran to the north and then looped around on the eastern slope of the Nagold valley to run parallel on the same hillside but a lot higher and now running south. The model for this type of alignment was the Brenner Railway in Austria.|$|R

With the resulting wheel/rail interaction degradation indicators are evaluated. Increased track shift forces are considered as an indicator of further track geometry degradation. Two different RCF indices (one shakedown map based and one wear number based) are used to quantify surface degradation of rails. Measured lateral track irregularities were found to follow a normal distribution reasonably well. Furthermore, the standard deviation of track shift forces was shown to have a linear relationship with the standard deviation of the lateral irregularities. For <b>large</b> <b>curve</b> <b>radii</b> an increase of the level of lateral irregularities increases the length of rail affected by RCF.

The s-curve options were out of the question because of [...] the <b>large</b> <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> required for efficient and fast subway operation. As a result, the alignment at 125th Street was changed. Instead, the line would continue via Second Avenue until 125th Street, when it would then curve under a small number of private properties before heading west on 125th Street. A future extension to the Bronx would be allowed from Second Avenue as opposed to Lexington Avenue. This alignment also allows {{for the construction of a}} storage yard north of 125th Street.|$|R
