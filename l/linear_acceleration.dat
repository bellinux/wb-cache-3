25|$|In fact, {{the human}} body has seven sensory systems – not five. The sixth and seventh systems are the senses of motion located in the inner ear. The former signals the {{beginning}} and end of rotation and the latter signals body tilt relative to gravity as well as body translation. The seventh system no longer provides tilt information in weightlessness; however, it does continue to signal translation, so the afferent signals to the CNS are confusing. The experience of living and working in space alters the way the CNS interprets the otolith organ signals during <b>linear</b> <b>acceleration.</b> Although the perception is fairly accurate when subjects are exposed to angular acceleration in yaw in-flight, there are disturbances during angular rotation in pitch and roll, and during <b>linear</b> <b>acceleration</b> along the body transversal and longitudinal axes. Perception of body motion is also altered during the same motion immediately after landing. There is an adaptation to weightlessness in orbit that carries over to post-flight reactions to <b>linear</b> <b>acceleration.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{auditory}} vesicle will {{give rise to}} the utricular and saccular components of the membranous labyrinth. They contain the sensory hair cells and otoliths of the macula of utricle and of the saccule, respectively, which respond to <b>linear</b> <b>acceleration</b> and the force of gravity. The utricular division of the {{auditory vesicle}} also responds to angular acceleration, {{as well as the}} endolymphatic sac and duct that connect the saccule and utricle.|$|E
25|$|Balance, equilibrioception, or {{vestibular}} {{sense is}} the sense that allows an organism to sense body movement, direction, and acceleration, and to attain and maintain postural equilibrium and balance. The organ of equilibrioception is the vestibular labyrinthine system found in both of the inner ears. In technical terms, this organ is responsible for two senses of angular momentum acceleration and <b>linear</b> <b>acceleration</b> (which also senses gravity), but they are known together as equilibrioception.|$|E
5000|$|Utricle {{responds}} to <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations</b> and head-tilts in the horizontal plane (head to shoulder), whereas saccule {{responds to}} <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations</b> and head-tilts in the vertical plane (up and down). Otolithic organs update the brain on the head-location when not moving; SCC update during movement.|$|R
50|$|Angular {{accelerations}} are {{detected by}} semicircular canals while <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations</b> are detected by another {{structure in the}} inner ear called the otolith.|$|R
50|$|Somatogyral illusions {{occur as}} a result of angular {{accelerations}} stimulating the semicircular canals. Somatogravic illusions, on the other hand, {{occur as a}} result of <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations</b> stimulating the otolith organs.|$|R
25|$|Endolymphatic infillings such as {{otoliths}} are {{structures in}} the saccule and utricle of the inner ear, specifically in the vestibular labyrinth of all vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds). In vertebrates, the saccule and utricle together make the otolith organs. Both statoconia and otoliths are used as gravity, balance, movement, and directional indicators in all vertebrates and have a secondary function in sound detection in higher aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates. They are sensitive to gravity and <b>linear</b> <b>acceleration.</b> Because of their orientation in the head, the utricle is sensitive {{to a change in}} horizontal movement, and the saccule gives information about vertical acceleration (such as when in an elevator).|$|E
25|$|The iPhone 4 {{introduces}} a gyroscopic sensor that detects 3-axis angular acceleration around the X, Y and Z axes, enabling precise calculation of yaw, pitch, and roll. The gyroscope complements the accelerometer, a sensor {{that has been}} present since the original iPhone, which detects the device's acceleration, shake, vibration shock, or fall by detecting <b>linear</b> <b>acceleration</b> along one of three axes (X, Y and Z). The combined data from the accelerometer and the gyroscope provides detailed and precise information about the device's 6-axis movement in space. The 3 axes of the gyroscope combined with the 3 axes of the accelerometer enable the device to recognize approximately how far, fast, and in which direction it has moved in space.|$|E
25|$|In weightlessness, astronauts {{must rely}} {{much more on}} vision to {{maintain}} their spatial orientation, because the otolith organs can no longer signal the “down” direction. During prolonged exposure, however, reliance seems to shift toward an intrinsic, body vertical reference. The erroneous illusions of self-motion during head movements performed during and after return to Earth gravity are presumably due to a re-interpretation of vestibular inputs. Ground-based {{studies suggest that the}} CNS resolves the “tilt-translation” ambiguity based on the frequency content of the <b>linear</b> <b>acceleration</b> detected by the otolith organs, with low frequency indicating “tilt” and high frequency indicating “translation”. A crossover exists at about 0.3Hz where the otolith signals are then ambiguous. Exposure to weightlessness presumably results in a shift of this crossover frequency, which could then contribute to spatial disorientation and SMS.|$|E
50|$|Somatogravic illusions {{are caused}} by <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations.</b> These illusions {{involving}} the utricle and the saccule of the vestibular system are most likely under conditions with unreliable or unavailable external visual references.|$|R
30|$|In Young et al. (2010), {{propagation}} of <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations</b> through the segment hierarchy {{was used to}} improve {{the identification of the}} gravity components under high acceleration motions.

50|$|The {{vestibular}} system {{consists of}} the otolith organs and the semicircular canals. Illusions in aviation are caused when the brain cannot reconcile the vestibular and visual inputs. The semicircular canals, {{of which there are}} three recognizing accelerations in pitch, yaw, and roll, are stimulated by angular accelerations; the otolith organs, the saccule and utricle, are stimulated by <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations.</b> Stimulation of the semicircular canals occurs when movement of the endolymph inside the canals causes movement of the crista ampullaris and the hair cells within them. Stimulation of the otolith organs occurs when gravitational forces or <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations</b> cause movement of the otolith membrane, the otoliths, and the hair cells of the macula.|$|R
25|$|Vectors are {{fundamental}} {{in the physical}} sciences. They {{can be used to}} represent any quantity that has magnitude, has direction, and which adheres to the rules of vector addition. An example is velocity, the magnitude of which is speed. For example, the velocity 5 meters per second upward could be represented by the vector (0,5) (in 2 dimensions with the positive y axis as 'up'). Another quantity represented by a vector is force, since it has a magnitude and direction and follows the rules of vector addition. Vectors also describe many other physical quantities, such as linear displacement, displacement, <b>linear</b> <b>acceleration,</b> angular acceleration, linear momentum, and angular momentum. Other physical vectors, such as the electric and magnetic field, are represented as a system of vectors at each point of a physical space; that is, a vector field. Examples of quantities that have magnitude and direction but fail to follow the rules of vector addition: Angular displacement and electric current. Consequently, these are not vectors.|$|E
25|$|Movement {{of fluid}} in the semicircular canals signals the brain about the {{direction}} and speed of rotation of the head – for example, whether we are nodding our head up and down or looking from right to left. Each semicircular canal has a bulbed end, or enlarged portion, that contains hair cells. Rotation of the head causes a flow of fluid, which in turn causes displacement of the top portion of the hair cells that are embedded in the jelly-like cupula. Two other organs {{that are part of}} the vestibular system are the utricle and saccule. These are called the otolithic organs and are responsible for detecting <b>linear</b> <b>acceleration,</b> or movement in a straight line. The hair cells of the otolithic organs are blanketed with a jelly-like layer studded with tiny calcium stones called otoconia. When the head is tilted or the body position is changed with respect to gravity, the displacement of the stones causes the hair cells to bend.|$|E

5000|$|The Buoyancy Hypothesis {{posits that}} alcohol causes vertigo by {{affecting}} the neutral buoyancy of the cupula within the surrounding fluid called the endolymph. <b>Linear</b> <b>accelerations</b> (such {{as that of}} gravity) should not in theory effect a movement of the cupula when it is neutrally buoyant. The Buoyancy Hypothesis assumes that alcohol, with a different specific gravity {{from that of the}} cupula/endolymph, diffuses at different rates into the cupula and the surrounding endolymph. The result is a temporary density gradient between the cupula and endolymph, and a consequent (erroneous) sensitivity to <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations</b> such as that of gravity by a system normally signalling rotational accelerations. This sensation is commonly referred to as [...] "the spins" [...]|$|R

40|$|During <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations,</b> {{compensatory}} reflexes should continually {{occur in}} order to maintain objects of visual interest as stable images on the retina. In the present study, the three-dimensional organization of the vestibulo-ocular reflex in pigeons was quantitatively examined during <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations</b> produced by constant velocity off-vertical axis yaw rotations and translational motion in darkness. With off-vertical axis rotations, sinusoidally modulated eye-position and velocity responses were observed in all three components, with the vertical and torsional eye movements predominating the response. Peak torsional and vertical eye positions occurred when the head was oriented with the lateral visual axis of the right eye directed orthogonal to or aligned with the gravity vector, respectively. No steady-state horizontal nystagmus was obtained with any of the rotational velocities (8 - 58 degrees /s) tested. During translational motion, delivered along or perpendicular to the lateral visual axis, vertical and torsional eye movements were elicited. No significant horizontal eye movements were observed during lateral translation at frequencies up to 3 Hz. These responses suggest that, in pigeons, all <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations</b> generate eye movements that are compensatory to the direction of actual or perceived tilt of the head relative to gravity. In contrast, no translational horizontal eye movements, which are known to be compensatory to lateral translational motion in primates, were observed under the present experimental conditions...|$|R
2500|$|The {{vestibular}} nerve conducts information from sensory receptors in three ampulla that sense motion of fluid in three semicircular canals caused by three-dimensional {{rotation of the}} head. [...] The {{vestibular nerve}} also conducts information from the utricle and the saccule, which contain hair-like sensory receptors that bend {{under the weight of}} otoliths (which are small crystals of calcium carbonate) that provide the inertia needed to detect head rotation, <b>linear</b> <b>acceleration,</b> and the direction of gravitational force.|$|E
2500|$|On Earth, {{our bodies}} react {{automatically}} to gravity, maintaining both posture and locomotion in a downward pulling world. In microgravity environments, these constant signals are absent: the otolith organs {{in the inner}} ear are sensitive to <b>linear</b> <b>acceleration</b> and no longer perceive a downwards bias; muscles are no longer required to contract to maintain posture, and pressure receptors in the feet and ankles no longer signal the direction of [...] "down". These changes can immediately result in visual-orientation illusions where the astronaut feels he has flipped 180 degrees. [...] Over half of astronauts also experience symptoms of motion sickness {{for the first three}} days of travel due to the conflict between what the body expects and what the body actually perceives. Over time however the brain adapts and although these illusions can still occur, most astronauts begin to see [...] "down" [...] as where the feet are. People returning to Earth after extended weightless periods have to readjust to the force of gravity and may have problems standing up, focusing their gaze, walking and turning. This is just an initial problem, as they recover these abilities quickly.|$|E
2500|$|Under [...] "normal", {{progressive}} and <b>linear</b> <b>acceleration</b> and deceleration, the DSG shifts in a sequential manner; i.e., under acceleration: 1st → 2nd → 3rd → 4th → 5th → 6th, {{and the same}} sequence reversed for deceleration. However, the DSG can also skip the normal sequential method, by missing gears, and shift two or more gears. This is most apparent if the car is being driven at sedate speeds {{in one of the}} higher gears with a light throttle opening, and the accelerator pedal is then pressed down, engaging the kick-down function. During kick-down, the DSG will skip gears, shifting directly to the most appropriate gear depending on speed and throttle opening. This kick-down may be engaged by any increased accelerator pedal opening, and is completely independent of the additional resistance to be found when the pedal is pressed fully to the floor, which will activate a similar kick-down function when in Manual operation mode. The seven-speed unit in the 2007 Audi variants will not automatically shift to 6th gear; rather, it stays at 5th to keep power available at a high RPM while cruising.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} three {{different}} methods of gait event detection (toe-off and heel strike) using miniature linear accelerometers and angular velocity transducers {{in comparison to}} using standard pressure-sensitive foot switches. Detection was performed with normal and spinal-cord injured subjects. The detection of end contact (EC), normally toe-off, and initial contact (IC) normally, heel strike was based on either foot <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations</b> or foot sagittal angular velocity or shank sagittal angular velocity. The results showed that all three methods were as accurate as foot switches in estimating times of IC and EC for normal gait patterns. In spinal-cord injured subjects, shank angular velocity was significantly less accurate (p < 0. 02). We conclude that detection based on foot <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations</b> or foot angular velocity can correctly identify the timing of IC and EC events in both normal and spinal-cord injured subjects...|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of the otolith organs enables them to sense both static displacements, as would be caused by tilting the head relative to the gravitational axis, and transient displacements caused by translational movements of the head. The mass of the otolithic membrane relative to the surrounding endolymph, {{as well as the}} membrane's physical uncoupling from the underlying macula, means that hair bundle displacement will occur transiently in response to <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations,</b> and tonically in response to tilting of the head. Prior to tiliting, the axon has a high firing rate, which increases or decreases depending on the direction of tilt. When the head is returned to its original position, the firing level returns to baseline value. In similar fashion, transient increases or decreases in firing rate from spontaneous levels signal the direction of <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations</b> of the head.|$|R

40|$|International audienceTilt-coordination is a {{technique}} which uses the tilt-translation ambiguity of the vestibular system to simulate <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations</b> on dynamic driving simulators, in combination with real <b>linear</b> <b>accelerations.</b> However, the tilt/translation ratio is chosen empirically. We experimentally determine the most realistic tilt/translation ratio to simulate a given value of deceleration. Under specific conditions of driving simulation, five tilt/translation ratios were applied, with an inverse-proportional quantity of tilt and translation, so that {{the sum of the}} two (the proportion of the deceleration simulated by translational motion and the proportion simulated by tilt) was always equal to the same overall value (0. 8 m/s(2)). We find that different ratios lead to different perceptions, depending on the quantity of tilt and translation. With a higher tilt ratio, the braking is perceived as being stronger than when there is a higher translation ratio and the most realistic tilt/translation ratio found is neither pure tilt, nor pure translation, but 35 / 65 % tilt/translation. The way these different ratios are perceived during braking is discussed from vestibular and non-vestibular points of view...|$|R
