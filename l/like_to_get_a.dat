500|$|The {{episode was}} the fifth episode {{of the season and}} the seventh of the entire series {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis. During the editing of the episode, executive producer Greg Daniels publicly addressed NBC in an interview, stating, [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> supersized episode, because it’s a really long script with a lot of good stuff." [...] In response, fans of the show set up an online petition to [...] "supersize" [...] the season finale. The website generated over 2,800 signatures. On April 20, NBC announced it would be extending the season finale by ten minutes. Although other NBC shows Will & Grace and My Name Is Earl that aired on the same night had extended episodes, cast members David Denman and John Krasinski credited in interviews the petition for the extended time. Denman and Krasinski both believed that the petition was partially responsible for the other two shows getting extended times as well.|$|E
500|$|Discussing {{the season}} finale, Tancharoen stated, [...] "This season, we've {{explored}} {{a lot of}} different themes: There's the notion of purpose. We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. We talk a lot about destiny and all these things intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E
