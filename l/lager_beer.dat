In honour of her predecessor's racing record, Bluenose II does not officially race. The replica has undergone several refits to extend her life. This vessel was decommissioned and dismantled in 2010, and an entirely new Bluenose (also named Bluenose II, since Transport Canada deemed it a [...] "reconstruction") was built as close to the original schooner deemed necessary and launched in Lunenburg in 2013.

2500|$|Niederstein's, {{a renowned}} local restaurant, was located at 69-16 Metropolitan Avenue {{until it was}} {{demolished}} in 2005.

Huess later sold the land to Henry Schumacher, a then-27-year-old Württemberg native. In 1850, Schumacher built a 2-story wooden roadside lodge, called the Schumacher's <b>Lager</b> <b>Beer</b> Saloon and Hotel, on the Williamsburgh and Jamaica Turnpike. Ferguson sold the remaining [...] to Schumacher in 1864, by which time the area's hotels were booming in popularity. In 1888, Schumacher was dead and his wife, Catharina Sutter, sold {{the building and the}} business to John Niederstein, a German cook. Niederstein built 32 rooms with two wings and operated the lodge as a hotel. Henrietta Gabriel, John Niederstein's granddaughter, bought the business from Grace, Niederstein's daughter-in-law, in 1920. In 1969, Gabriel sold the hotel to Reiner and Horst Herink, who operated the structure as a restaurant. Once patronized by 130 thousand annual diners, the restaurant became less popular by the 1990s.
