5000|$|Some of {{the earlier}} C8FTHB {{carbines}} used old refurbished C8 receivers. [...] "FTHB" [...] was stamped next to the C8 markings on the <b>lower</b> <b>receivers.</b> Colt Canada later manufactured new <b>lower</b> <b>receivers</b> with C8FTHB markings. Later, C8FTHB carbines that were upgraded to the C8A3 had [...] "A3" [...] stamped next to the markings, giving [...] "C8FTHBA3" [...] markings. Only 400 C8FTHBs were upgraded to C8FTHBA3s before Colt Canada started simply marking new receivers [...] "C8A3".|$|R
2500|$|Bushmaster {{has also}} {{developed}} a 6.8mm Remington SPC and a 7.62×39mm version of the rifle, simply named the 6.8mm SPC Rifle and the 7.62×39mm Carbine respectively, {{as well as a}} separate upper receiver kit that can be installed on any AR-15 type <b>lower</b> <b>receiver.</b> [...] It is available as either the A2 or the A3.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to import}} restrictions, the American {{civilian}} market required a partially American-made version assembled by SIG SAUER, Inc. in Exeter, New Hampshire.

2500|$|The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, {{semi-automatic}} shotgun {{that resembles}} the M16 rifle and mimics the layout and placement {{of some of}} the controls. It was created by Turkish company Akdal Arms. [...] The MKA 1919 uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be quickly removed from upper receiver. To charge the rifle, the charging handle on the receiver must be pulled. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the <b>lower</b> <b>receiver,</b> along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic rifle has a 5-round detachable box magazine. It has a bolt release identical in location and [...] function to the one on the M16. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style being located {{on the left side of}} the receiver above the pistol grip. Standard sights include a front post installed on the M16-style removable base and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight. On the upper receiver, an integral Picatinny rail exists which will accept detachable carrying handle or optional red-dot or other optical sight attachments.|$|E
50|$|Upper {{and lower}} receivers: The rifles were {{produced}} by the Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) at Fort Benning, Georgia using either new semi-automatic ArmaLite <b>lower</b> <b>receivers</b> or existing Army M16A2 or A4 <b>lower</b> <b>receivers</b> previously supplied by either Colt or Fabrique Nationale de Herstal. All rifles were equipped with a fixed A2 stock and a Knight's Armament Company 2-stage match grade trigger capable of only semi-automatic fire. The upper receivers were flat-top style, but unlike the SAM-R and SPR, {{they did not have}} extended feed ramps.|$|R
50|$|SIG {{designed}} the upper receiver to {{be compatible with}} standard AR-15 and M16 <b>lower</b> <b>receivers</b> {{with the help of}} an adapter. The overall layout of the two rifles is similar.|$|R
50|$|Lower Receiver: When the SPR {{program was}} still just an upper {{receiver}} assembly (and {{not a complete}} rifle), Crane assembled all of its prototypes using either M16A1 or M4A1 <b>lower</b> <b>receivers,</b> because the full auto trigger group in these <b>lower</b> <b>receivers</b> provided a consistent pull while the more common 3-round burst trigger groups didn't. It is unknown whether this pattern continued as the rifle evolved. There is also some issue about whether, when the Navy type-classified the weapon, Precision Reflex Incorporated (PRI) began assembling the rifles themselves. While a number of trigger options were tried in the end, the Knight's Armament Company (KAC) 2-stage trigger was finally decided upon as the standard.|$|R
50|$|The {{heart of}} the APR is a metal <b>lower</b> <b>receiver</b> that {{functions}} as a main frame or chassis to which all other rifle components are assembled or attached. The manual ambidextrous safety is integrated into the <b>lower</b> <b>receiver.</b> This chassis houses the upper receiver which consists of a bolt group and barrel, {{as well as the}} fire control group, folding butt stock and other furniture. The contact surface between upper and <b>lower</b> <b>receiver</b> functions as an unconventional bedding surface.|$|E

5000|$|The P22 {{is offered}} in many {{different}} color variations of its polymer <b>lower</b> <b>receiver.</b> The pistol is available in black, olive drab, grey, carbon fiber and 3 pink versions. Additionally, the Walther P22 comes {{in a variety of}} camouflage options (e.g. pink [...] "digi-cam" [...] and leaf camo). There is now a new <b>lower</b> <b>receiver</b> finish that looks like Damascus steel. The slide assembly will have either a blue-black applied finish or it will be finished with a nickel/stainless look. Along with the new finish for the <b>lower</b> <b>receiver,</b> the slide also has a new finish option of brushed stainless.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a scale model to analyze the performance of the inclined barrier design. A computer program was used to outline the zone of noise variation with the tilted angle of a barrier. The results of this study show that the average noise level at <b>lower</b> <b>receivers</b> behind the nearside barrier could be reduced by 4 dB and 10 dB for 125 Hz and 500 Hz respectively by tilting the angle of the farside barrier by over 10 degree. This result seems to be sufficient to counteract the reflected noise problems at <b>lower</b> <b>receivers.</b> It is also noted that degradation is smaller for low frequency. The simple image source and virtual barrier model computer program can help us to locate the critical reflection zone with different tilted angles of the barriers.

5000|$|It {{should also}} be noted that the upper {{receiver}} (to which the barrel with its chamber are attached) and the <b>lower</b> <b>receiver</b> are entirely separate parts in AR-15 style rifles. If the <b>lower</b> <b>receiver</b> has either [...]223 or 5.56 stamped on it, it does not guarantee the upper assembly is rated for the same caliber, because the upper and the <b>lower</b> <b>receiver</b> in the same rifle can, and frequently do, come from different manufacturers - particularly with rifles sold to civilians or second-hand rifles that have been repaired with spare parts. Since all parts are interchangeable, a shooter MUST take great caution to check for markings of 5.56×45mm on the barrel before attempting to fire 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition out of it.|$|E
50|$|Randy Luth founded Defense Procurement Manufacturing Services (DPMS) in 1985 in Osseo, Minnesota as a {{precision}} machine shop for manufacturing M203, M14 and M16 parts for U.S. military contracts. He also developed many patents. In the later 1990s he employed 30 people selling Colt 1911 and AR-15 {{parts and accessories}} and moved the company to Becker, Minnesota. Luth later worked with a manufacturer of <b>lower</b> <b>receivers</b> and began producing AR-15 modern sporting rifles (MSR).|$|R

With regard to standard capacity magazine devices, after January 1, 2000, it is illegal to offer for sale, import, manufacture, give, or lend (although it is legal to possess and use) any detachable box magazine with a capacity exceeding 10 cartridges. [...] Individuals possessing such magazines at a lawful location such as a gun range may only allow use of their lawfully owned standard-capacity magazines by another if they are in the immediate vicinity of the person using such items. All magazines acquired after (and including) January 1, 2000 must be a limited capacity of 10 rounds or be in felony possession of an illegal standard-capacity magazine.|$|R
50|$|Overall, {{the design}} is simple and {{effective}} with some clever touches; for example the bolt guide rod assembly guides the bolt in the receiver, retains the recoil springs and the rear end of the top handguard, as well as serving as the latch holding the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>receivers</b> together in the closed position. Disassembly is somewhat similar to the AR-15, with the working parts accessed by the rifle pivoting open on a hinge pin immediately forward of the magazine well.|$|R
50|$|The upper {{receiver}} is {{made from}} stamped steel, the <b>lower</b> <b>receiver,</b> along with magazine housing, {{is made from}} aluminum alloy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lower</b> <b>receiver</b> is forged from 7075 aluminum, can mount {{any type}} of AR-15/M-16 pistol grip, and {{features}} an ambidextrous magazine latch just forward of the integral trigger guard. Also featured within the <b>lower</b> <b>receiver</b> is the rifle's trigger assembly. The trigger assembly can {{be removed from the}} receiver as a single unit, and features adjustment screws for weight (2 to 4 lbs.) and overtravel, as well as a reversible AR-15/M-16 style thumb safety.|$|E
5000|$|Some ghost {{guns are}} AR-15 style {{firearms}}. AR-15s are modular firearms and {{the serial number}} {{is applied to the}} <b>lower</b> <b>receiver,</b> which holds the trigger group. Once an individual has an AR-15 <b>lower</b> <b>receiver,</b> they can assemble a complete weapon using widely available components, such as barrels, stocks, magazines, and upper receivers. Other ghost guns include pistols and AK-47 style semi-automatic rifles. The Philippines is a center of ghost gun production, especially [...]45 semi-automatic pistols.|$|E

50|$|The CAR-15 Heavy Assault Rifle M2 was a belt-fed version using heavily {{modified}} {{upper and}} <b>lower</b> <b>receivers.</b> Colt engineer Rob Roy designed a special ammunition box {{to hold a}} 50-round or 120-round ammunition belt {{as well as the}} expended links. The belt-fed CAR-15 was similar to the belt-fed AR-10 developed by Eugene Stoner and John Peck at ArmaLite. The Army evaluated its use as a helicopter door machine gun but rejected it, so less than 20 of the Heavy Assault Rifle M2s were made.|$|R
25|$|The rifle's front {{handguard}} is of a ribbed design, {{with heat}} ventilation holes. This design improves barrel cooling in situations when sustained fire is performed. The SS2's barrels were originally produced in Germany before Pindad switched to South Korean-made barrels due to arms embargo {{problems at the}} time. The charging handle {{is on the right}} side of the SS2 with the fire/safety selector on the left side with provision for single and full auto fire alongside safe mode. Upper and <b>lower</b> <b>receivers</b> are made from aluminum alloy and are connected via cross pins.|$|R
