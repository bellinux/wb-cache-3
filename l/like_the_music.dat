Entitled Making Michael Jackson's Thriller, it, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> video, was shown heavily on MTV for a time and was the top-selling home-video release of all time at one point, with over nine million copies sold. MTV paid $250,000 for the exclusive rights to show the documentary; Showtime paid $300,000 for pay-cable rights; and Vestron Video reportedly paid $500,000 to market the cassette, in a profit participation agreement.|$|E
5|$|Jay Farrar, {{along with}} his {{brothers}} Wade and Dade, played in an early 1980s garage band named The Plebes. Hailing from Belleville, Illinois, The Plebes sought to enter a battle-of-the-bands competition but needed another high school student as a member to perform. They invited Jeff Tweedy, a high school friend of Jay Farrar, to join the band and play with them for the show. Despite a lack of skill with his instrument, Tweedy {{played an important role}} in the band by booking early gigs. While The Plebes had been playing music in a rockabilly style, Tweedy wanted to play punk rock <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> that he originally heard the group perform. This caused tensions between Tweedy and Dade Farrar, who left the band two months after Tweedy joined.|$|E
25|$|The band also {{recorded}} other works {{which were not}} published, like a song to Hindin, a poem by Davíð Stefánsson, sung by Elín and Eiríkur Hauksson and with some backing vocals added by Magnús. Svavar Gests was reluctant to publish the record as he did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> nor even the cover design, however, his wife persuaded him to release it.|$|E

25|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> of Asia, India and the Middle East, it's {{a highly}} rhythmic music. In fact, the only {{music in the}} world that isn't rhythmically complex is Western music. African music {{consists}} of complex rhythmic patterns, often involving one rhythm played against another to create a Polyrhythm. The most common Polyrhythm plays three beats on top of two, like a triplet played against straight notes.|$|E
25|$|The {{album was}} re-released as a 2-disc 'Deluxe Edition' on 22 October 2012. The second disc {{includes}} the album re-recorded, with each song {{performed in a}} different style, including acoustic performances. It was recorded at Regal House Studio in Cambridgeshire, and produced by Lee Batiuk, with Chris Pennells and Lee Wilson involved in the recording process unlike the original release, after the band were inspired to experiment with their sound by performing at St Pancras International railway station {{as part of the}} Station Sessions. This was the same studio where the drums were recorded for the original release. Speaking about the Station Sessions performance, which was an acoustic 'stripped down' performance, James Veck-Gilodi explained; 'we thought we sounded better than we did as a rock band' and noted that 'it's nice to make music that sounds more <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> I listen to'. The release will feature banjo, mandolin and piano.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Guardian, Clarkson said {{that she wanted to}} include the song in her first album, Thankful (2003), but she was laughed at. Then, she took the initiative to polish the song by sending a tape to Moody and Hodges, whom later worked with her and received co-writing credit of the song. Clarkson explained, [...] "Hearing the Evanescence album, you can obviously tell that David and Ben have a real passion for music and that big kind of background. And I have a big voice and I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> to match it, so it was a real dream team." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{song was}} {{a staple of}} the band's setlist from 1998, through to 2005. Since then, apart from a number of shows during the band's stint on the 2007 Projekt Revolution tour, it has not been performed. In November 2013, in an interview, Brian Molko stated that {{although}} he still <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> <b>music,</b> <b>the</b> lyrics of the song nauseate him.|$|R
50|$|His {{job there}} was to code a <b>music</b> {{sequencer}} for <b>the</b> Sega Mega Drive, he wrote some music on it to demonstrate how it worked. <b>The</b> boss <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> and he asked him to write <b>the</b> <b>music</b> for Asterix and the Power of the Gods.|$|R
500|$|Wright's main {{influence}} was jazz, particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of {{music with a}} theme, later saying [...] "if {{the words came out}} <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music,</b> and we didn't have anything else to do, then quite a few would be written". A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, some of which were picked up enthusiastically by his band mates. Wright later said [...] "I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, I just let it happen". Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.|$|E
500|$|By winter 2000, Wilco had {{completed}} enough material for an album release. However, Tweedy was {{dissatisfied with the}} [...] "emotional center" [...] of the recordings. He wanted the release to sound more <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> he had recorded with Loose Fur, although he [...] "couldn't {{put his finger on}} why." [...] Tweedy wanted the album to advance the sound of Wilco in a similar fashion as Being There and Summerteeth. He became irritated by Wilco drummer Ken Coomer because Coomer disliked playing consistent drum patterns each time that the band played a song. Wilco guitarist Jay Bennett also soured on Coomer because of the drummer's lack of patience and consistency. Although he briefly considered adding Kotche as a secondary percussionist, Tweedy decided to replace Coomer with his Loose Fur bandmate: ...|$|E
500|$|Neha Mujumdar of The Hindu was {{extremely}} {{disappointed with the}} track, calling it [...] "musically generic" [...] and [...] "lyrically filled with platitudes". She gave a negative review of the production, and panned Chopra's [...] "auto-tuned" [...] vocals. Mujumdar wrote that will.I.am's rapping [...] "does little to relieve the monotony; indeed, it manages to increase it, because of how predictable his exhortations are", and that apart fulfilling a desire for [...] "the sort of over-produced music that typically fills up a fast-food chain store", the song is indistinguishable [...] "from the large body of repetitive, unoriginal dance-pop". Writing for the US online news portal GlobalPost, Jason Overdorf {{did not agree with}} early reviews that said [...] "In My City" [...] sounded <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> of The Black Eyed Peas.|$|E
50|$|The Austrian premiere was in Kremsmünster on June 24, 1792, a {{performance}} in Salzburg followed in 1796. When Empress Marie Therese visited Salzburg in 1805, she <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> {{so much she}} wanted to have her own copy of the score.|$|R

[...] In a 2008 interview with Dan MacIntosh, Shaver said of the LP, [...] "Oh, it was great, because the songs were bigger than me. And I couldn't possibly sing as good as Waylon. And at the time, Waylon was just great, so great, and I knew something was gonna happen good for him, and sure enough it helped me and it helped him, too, and that's a pretty good trade." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Rock with U" [...] {{was directed by}} Saam Farahmand and choreographed by Gil Duldulao. It premiered on Access Granted on March 5, 2008. Jackson described Farahmand as an excited, passionated and creative person. He {{wanted to make the}} video as a long take video, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> video for previous single [...] "Feedback", which he also directed. According to the singer, the makeup looks and fashion of the video were a [...] "futuristic version of the Blitz Kids from the 80's". Dulduao commented [...] "I just wanted sort of bring Janet into the visionary style she's had in the past and I wanted to bring to like, video, and bring it back". He also mentioned that it took him at least {{a day and a half}} to finish its choreography.|$|E

You are gonna love it. You are gonna go crazy!" [...] Production {{of the project was}} a main focus on Minaj's three-part E! special, Nicki Minaj: My Truth, which aired in November 2012. On On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Minaj stated that [...] "I feel <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> is such a better representation of me where I am now as an artist in my career.

500|$|Minimal {{elements}} of the song {{were included in the}} live performance of [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] on The MDNA Tour (2012). [...] "Material Girl" [...] was included in the final section of the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16). For this section, Madonna worked with designer Jeremy Scott for party inspired costumes. She wanted a [...] "Harlem-flapper-meets-Paris-in-the-Twenties" [...] look, and Scott came up with the final dress adorned with thousands of Swarovski crystals. Following the jazz rendition of 2000 single [...] "Music", Madonna's started performing [...] "Material Girl", in a similar theme <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> video. Towards the end, Madonna changed the choreography, and made her dancers who posed as suitors, to fall down the stairs instead. The performance ended with the singer walking down the catwalk in a bridal veil and carrying a white bouquet, which she eventually throws into the crowd. Utilizing the stage as both stairs as well as video backdrop, the stairs rose up and down during the song.|$|E
500|$|... "Poker Face" [...] {{has been}} {{performed}} by Gaga {{at a number}} of shows including the AOL Sessions, the Cherrytree House of Interscope Records, and also the MTV sessions.

She performed the piano version wearing a dress made of plastic transparent bubbles and playing the glass piano with her stilletoes with a glowing mannequin, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> video, {{standing in front of the}} stage. Gaga claimed that the transparent bubble filled piano was specifically made to match her dress. The actual version was performed by Gaga as the final song of the encore, after [...] "Boys, Boys, Boys". She started the performance saying [...] "Some say Lady Gaga is a lie, and they’re right: I am a lie, and every day I kill to make it true." [...] Gaga wore a nude corseted leotard embellished with crystals and an admiral's hat during the performance. The hat as well as the fingerless gloves worn were decorated with the word Gaga on it.|$|E
500|$|Commenting on {{the success}} of American {{producers}} such as Skrillex, Skream stated: [...] "I think it hurts a lot of people over here because it's a UK sound, but it's been someone with influences outside the original sound that has made it a lot bigger. The bad side of that {{is that a lot of}} people will just say 'dubstep equals Skrillex'. But in all honesty it genuinely doesn't bother me. I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> he makes." [...] Other North American artists that were initially associated with the brostep sound were Canadian producers Datsik and Excision. Their production style has been described by Mixmag as [...] "a viciously harsh, yet brilliantly produced sound that appealed more to Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails fans than it did to lovers of UK garage". The brostep sound also attracted the attention of metal bands. [...] Nu metal band Korn's 2011 album The Path of Totality features several collaborations with electronic music producers, including Skrillex and Excision. [...] The term metalstep has been used for a fusion of brostep and metal.|$|E

500|$|Edna Gunderson of USA Today was positive, commenting, [...] "The music, while upbeat {{and even}} giddy, steers away from {{adolescent}} pranks and pratfalls, a welcome upgrade. The band creates a fresh breed of post-punk power pop by roughing up bright melodies." [...] AllMusic's Brian O'Neill gave the album three stars, {{calling it a}} [...] "far cry from the party-boy ethos DeLonge is best known for, and he wears the emotional depth well, with songs that are just as hooky as from his bread-winning main squeeze." [...] A reviewer for Q admitted that the musicians [...] "confound expectations with a very good record." [...] The positive reception of the album was {{in contrast to the}} reviews for Blink, which were often negative. [...] "I think it's a cop-out for [...] to <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> I do," [...] DeLonge told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "Critics can't say they like Blink or give us any credit, 'cause we're out there goofing around." [...] Barker was more critical: [...] "I especially don't care what the critics say.

500|$|Minaj {{commented on}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest that [...] "I feel <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> {{is such a}} better {{representation}} of me where I am now as an artist in my career. As long as people can hear the music, I'm good." [...] Much of the new material incorporates hip hop and R styles previously seen in Minaj's earlier mixtapes. The opening track [...] "Up in Flames" [...] incorporates a [...] "slow, heavy and melodramatic beat", where Minaj addresses her wealth and delivers negative remarks directed towards her adversaries. The second song [...] "Freedom" [...] was compared to material from her debut studio album Pink Friday (2010); it utilizes minimal production and reflects on Minaj's rise to prominence. The third song [...] "Hell Yeah" [...] features Parker and further criticizes Minaj's opponents. She references her much-publicized on-set tension with fellow American Idol judge Mariah Carey in the line [...] "But I'm quick to check a bitch if she’s outta line" [...] and references the series' personnel in the line [...] "Shout out Mike Darnell and Nigel [...] / Why these bums so mad that the queen on Idol".|$|E
500|$|Foster, in the album's {{liner notes}} its 1995 reissue, called the music [...] "fresh {{as the day}} it was {{recorded}} and entirely captivating", but that it followed the tradition of the calypso of its era. [...] He described the album's genre as having [...] "Jazz, Afro-Cuban rhythms, Odetta-style folk", with [...] "gospel and blues voicings and Belafonte-influenced Caribbean flavors". Foster considered Tommy Tedesco's guitar and Al Bello's percussion as having a [...] "Beat-era spiritual sound". He thought that Angelou brought out the best in the calypso standards [...] "Peas and Rice" [...] and [...] "Run Joe", but that she reached her peak with [...] "Scandal in the Family", all of which he found as authentic as the songs she wrote. He stated that two of the songs Angelou wrote, [...] "Mambo in Africa" [...] and [...] "Neighbor, Neighbor", effectively combined her skills as a poet and composer. He compared her music with other calypso artists of the same era, but considered hers more [...] "uptown" [...] and more <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> of modern artists such as Tracy Chapman. Foster also compared Angelou's music in Miss Calypso with her later writing, and called both [...] "hot and spicy, peppered with a roots flavoring". [...] Jessica Letkemann of Billboard Magazine stated that Angelou's tuneful and distinctive voice would [...] "serve her so well in later years as a spoken word artist".|$|E
