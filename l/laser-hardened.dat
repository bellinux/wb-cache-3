40|$|The {{running-in}} wear of a {{flake graphite}} {{grey cast iron}} in the untreated and <b>laser-hardened</b> conditions has been measured using a Talysurf with a precision relocation technique and the worn surface examined using scanning electron microscopy. For both types of iron wear was mainly abrasive, and no adhesive wear occured. With the untreated irons graphite was deposited on the wheel, wear continued with the higher load but reached a steady-state condition after about 100 m with the lower load, and wear followed approximately a truncation model. With the <b>laser-hardened</b> irons the amount of wear was reduced considerably, graphite was not deposited on the wheel, the profilometry data were irregular, and wear did not follow a truncation model. The microscopical and profilometry data are discussed {{in relation to the}} running-in process. ?? 1988...|$|E
40|$|Until now, quality {{inspection}} of <b>laser-hardened</b> components {{has only been}} performed statistically using time consuming and expensive destructive testing techniques. A multi-parameter nondestructive evaluation method to characterize <b>laser-hardened</b> surfaces was developed in this work. This method involves the nondestructive measurement of parameters including hardness, hardening depth, as well as residual stresses connected with the hardening process. The testing technique {{is based on the}} combination of four different electromagnetic testing methods. All measuring parameters derived from the different techniques are measured by one probe. The nondestructive evaluation of hardness, hardening depth and residual stresses is performed independent of the steel grade by approximation functions containing the most significant measuring parameters for the respective target. The calibration of the electromagnetic testing unit has to be performed for each steel grade separately. The electromagnetic data recorded on calibration specimens are correlated with the reference target values determined by conventional testing techniques at the same testing locations. By this procedure the regression coefficients of the approximation functions are fitted to the specific steel grade. A new nondestructive testing unit is currently being built {{based on the results of}} this project. This unit will be an important tool for the industrial user to ensure the manufacturing quality of <b>laser-hardened</b> components. (orig.)

40|$|The {{material}} properties of machined and hardened surfaces influence {{the performance of}} components because residual stress and hardness distributions in the surface region are determined by machining and hardening parameters. These hardness and residual stress profiles have to be detected by nondestructive testing methods. Besides the well known x-ray method, ferromagnetic techniques {{can be used for}} measuring microstructure parameters and residual stresses. The state of the art is described and first applications using the incremental permeability and the magnetic Barkhausen noise are discussed for characterizing <b>laser-hardened</b> and ground sub-surface zones...|$|E
40|$|The {{surface of}} En 31 steel was treated by CO 2 laser for solid state {{transformation}} hardening. The wear and friction {{characteristics of the}} treated surfaces were examined and compared with untreated surfaces using the lubricated ring-on-block technique. The microstructures of the <b>laser-hardened</b> tracks and the worn surfaces were studied by SEM. The {{results indicated that the}} surface of a single hardened track and the surface with two non-overlapping tracks have better wear and friction properties, as compared with the untreated surfaces. Further, surfaces with non-overlapping tracks were found to have better friction properties than the homogeneous hardened zone of a single track.

40|$|Micromagnetic Techniques {{developed}} {{during the last few}} Years {{have been found to be}} applicable to nondestructive evaluation of the machining quality of laser hardened components. Combining information of various microstructure- and stress-sensitive parameters, an immediate estimation of relevant quality parameters can be achieved. Using a multiple regression analysis, approximation functions can be obtained to determine values of hardness, hardening depth and residual stresses. Nondestructive evaluation of process/quality parameters is demonstrated for <b>laser-hardened</b> components using new multiparameter sensor systems. Based on these results, a prototype of a process integrated nondestructive testing system (PINT) for total inspection of laser-hardening quality is installed. Devices using PINT to monitor relevant quality parameters for process control in other industrial hardening applications (i. e. industion/case hardening) will be soon available...|$|E
40|$|The {{acceptance}} of C 02 lasers in industry to provide surface hardening is an established fact. Applications {{number in the}} hundreds in such diverse fields as automotive, office machines, air compressors, jet engines, military, paper converting, personal products, printing, plastics, forestry, mining, drilling, etc. Many specific examples are discussed with emphasis on why lasers were chosen and what significant economies in power consumption were realized. In one well-documented case, power consumption is shown to have dropped to 0. 29 % of the level for the previously used hardening process. The wear and fatigue characteristics of <b>laser-hardened</b> surfaces are reviewed. Reference is made to the operating principles of medium to high-power carbon-dioxide lasers. Typical examples are given of other laser processes such as welding, cutting, vaporizing, drilling, scribing, machining, etc...|$|E
40|$|Surface laser {{hardening}} of steels is {{a well-established}} industrial technology. The {{surface of the}} specimen is scanned with a high-power laser beam along the trace to be hardened. The rapid cooling due to the non-heated surroundings of the laser-treated zones leads to local hardening of the material. Non-destructive evaluation of some mechanical properties (hardness, residual stresses, etc) of the hardened region and the heat-affected zone are of technological importance. A previous paper reported non-destructive testing (NDT) experiments (by scanning of the specimens) made with the 3 MA-II (Multiparameter Micromagnetic Microstructure and Stress Analysis) equipment developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Non-Destructive Testing (IZFP), Saarbr√ºcken. This contribution presents an X-ray diffraction evaluation of the residual stresses in <b>laser-hardened</b> SAE 1045 steels and metallographic studies of the affected areas. The results are compared with the previously reported 3 MA-II output...|$|E
40|$|A {{heat-sink}} assisted laser transformation hardening {{method is}} presented as a way to enhance the hardenability of carbon steel sheets. In this study, the thermal conductivity of the heat sink and the thermal contact resistance between the steel sheet and the heat sink were identified as the two primary parameters for the process. Using a process map approach, the heat-treatability of steel sheets was studied theoretically focusing on carbon diffusion and cooling time characteristics. For validation purposes, 2 mm thick DP 590 and boron steel sheets were <b>laser-hardened</b> using four types of heat sink: stainless steel, steel, copper, and no heat sink. Surface hardness, hardening width and depth were measured and analyzed over a wide range of process parameters. From this study, it was revealed that, when a heat sink is used, both cooling and carbon diffusion characteristics become roughly on par with those of the thick plate case, but the heat treatable region remains {{similar to that of the}} no heat sink case. The use of a heat sink was found to be an effective way of enhancing the hardenability of steel sheets and the amount of enhancement is largely proportional to the heat sink thermal conductivity. close 1...|$|E
40|$|Typical entry vehicle aeroshells {{are limited}} in size by the launch vehicle shroud. Inflatable {{aerodynamic}} decelerators allow larger aeroshell diameters for entry vehicles {{because they are not}} constrained to the launch vehicle shroud diameter. During launch, the hypersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator (HIAD) is packed in a stowed configuration. Prior to atmospheric entry, the HIAD is deployed to produce a drag device many times larger than the launch shroud diameter. The large surface area of the inflatable aeroshell provides deceleration of high-mass entry vehicles at relatively low ballistic coefficients. Even for these low ballistic coefficients there is still appreciable heating, requiring the HIAD to employ a thermal protection system (TPS). This TPS must be capable of surviving the heat pulse, and the rigors of fabrication handling, high density packing, deployment, and aerodynamic loading. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of flexible TPS tests and results, conducted over the last three years. This paper also includes an overview of each test facility, the general approach for testing flexible TPS, the thermal analysis methodology and results, and a comparison with 8 -foot High Temperature Tunnel, <b>Laser-Hardened</b> Materials Evaluation Laboratory, and Panel Test Facility test data. Results are presented for a baseline TPS layup that can withstand a 20 W/cm 2 heat flux, silicon carbide (SiC) based TPS layup, and polyimide insulator TPS layup. Recent work has focused on developing material layups expected to survive heat flux loads up to 50 W/cm 2 (which is adequate for many potential applications), future work will consider concepts capable of withstanding more than 100 W/cm 2 incident radiant heat flux. This paper provides an overview of the experimental setup, material layup configurations, facility conditions, and planned future flexible TPS activities...|$|E
