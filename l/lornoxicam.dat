50|$|During rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, fluid {{from the}} {{vitreous}} humor enters a retinal hole. The {{mechanisms by which}} retinal holes or tears form are not fully understood yet. The accumulation of fluid in the subretinal space and the tractional force of the vitreous on the retina result in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. During this process the retinal cell layers {{come in contact with}} vitreous cytokines. These cytokines trigger the ability of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) to proliferate and migrate. The process involved resembles fibrotic wound healing by the RPE cells. The RPE cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and develop the ability to migrate out into the vitreous. During this process the RPE cell layer-neural retinal adhesion and RPE-ECM (extracellular matrix) adhesions are lost. The RPE cells lay down fibrotic membranes while they migrate and these membranes contract and pull at the retina. All these finally lead to secondary retinal detachment after primary retinal detachment surgery.A number of studies have also shown that arachidonic acid metabolic cascade (one of the major inflammatory cascades) is important in the development of PVR. COX-2 expression was found in human idiopathic epiretinal membranes. Phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase blocking reduced structural abnormalities of the rat retina in concanavalin model of PVR and reduced the frequency of membrane formation by 43% in the dispase model of PVR and by 31% in the concanavalin one. <b>Lornoxicam</b> not only normalized the expression of cyclooxygenases in both models of PVR, but also neutralized the changes of the retina and the choroid thickness caused by the injection of pro-inflammatory agents.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} SNP epoxygenase {{variants}} are as follows. 1) CYP2C8*3 (30411A>G, rs10509681, Lys399Arg) converts arachidonic acid to 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET with a turnover rate {{less than half}} that of wild type CYP2C8; in a single recent report, male but not female carriers of the CYP2C8*3 allele had an increased risk of essential hypertension. Bearers of this SNP may or may not show increased risk of developing acute gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are its substrates such as aceclofenac, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, <b>lornoxicam,</b> meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, tenoxicam, and valdecoxib. 2) CYP2J2*7 (−76G>T, rs890293, upstream Promoter (genetics) site) has decreased binding of the Sp1 transcription factor resulting in its lowered expressionas and lowered levels of EETs in plasma. Carriers of this SNP among a Uygur population in China had a higher risk of coronary artery disease. However, CYP2J2*7 carriers showed no association with hypertension, heart attack, or stroke in a study of 5,740 participants of the cardiovascular cohort of the Malmö Diet and Cancer study; since other studies have afforded contradictory results, this allele is currently regarded as not associated with cardiovascular diseases (see Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid#Clinical significance). [...] Bearers of this SNP in a Chinese Population had a higher risk of younger onset of type 2 diabetes and among a Chinese Han population had a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. 3) CYP2C8*2 (11054A>T, rs11572103, Ile269Phe) and CYP2C8*4 (11041C>, rs1058930, variants have reduced arachidonic acid-metabolizing activity but have not been clearly associated with cardiovascular or other diseases. 4) CYPC28*4 (3608C>T, rs1058930, Ile264Met) has reduced arachidonic acid metabolizing activity. It has not been associated with cardiovascular diseases but has a higher incidence in subjects with type II diabetes in a small sample of Caucasians in Germany. [...] 5) The CYP2C9*2 (3608C>T, rs1799853, Arg144Cys) variant has a 50% reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolizing activity compared to CYP2C9 wild type carriers of it show no association with cardiovascular disease but exhibit poor metabolism of the anti-coagulating, blood-thining agent, warfarin. These carriers are susceptible to the gastrointestinal bleeding side effects of warfarin and the NSAID cited above. 6 [...] ) CYP2C9*3 (42624A>C, rs1057910, Iso359Leu) encodes an expoxygenase with reduced arachidonic acid metabolizing activity. This allele has not been directly associated with cardiovascular diseases but may be associated with the poor metabolism and therefore adverse reactions to warfarin, NSAID, sulfonylurea-containing oral hypoglycemic agents, and the anti-(epilepsy) drug, phenytoin. 7) CYP2C19*2 (19154G>A, rs4244285, Il264Met) and CYP2C19*3 (17948G>A, rs4986893, His212X) are loss-of-function null alleles; carriers of the CYP2C19*3 but not the CYP2C19*2 allele showed a reduced risk of developing essential hypertension in a large Korean population study. Bearers of null alleles would be expected to be poor metabolizers of several drugs which are CYP2C19*2 or CYP2C19*3 substrates. This is particularly the case with Clopidogrel, a drug used to block platelet activation, blood clotting, and thereby heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery occlusion in people at high risk of these events; CYP2C19 metabolizes clopidogrel to it active form. Consequently, patients with severe deficiencies in this CYP, i.e. bearers of CYP2C19*3 or CYP2C19*2 alleles, fail to gain protection from clopidogrel and have a higher risk of the cited cardiovascular events than clopidogrel-treated patients bearing wild type CYP2C19 alleles. 8) CYPC19*17 (-800C>T, rs12248560, site upstream gene promoter site) causes overproduction of its epoxygenase and thereby the ultra fast metabolism of arachidonic acid. Bearers of this allele have not been associated with cardiovascular diseases but clearly show a decreased risk of developing breast cancer and endometriosis possible because their rapid metabolism of estrogen leads to lower estrogen levels and thereby a lower risk of these estrogen-fueled diseases. These bearers also a higher rate of metabolism of, and therefore reduced responsiveness to, certain proton pump inhibitor and antidepressant drugs.|$|E

The objective {{of the present study}} is to enhance the solubility and dissolution rate of <b>lornoxicam</b> employing Hydroxy propyl β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) and two surfactants (SLS and Tween 80) alone and in combination. The individual main effects and combined (interaction) effects of HPβ-cyclodextrin and surfactants on the solubility and dissolution rate of <b>lornoxicam</b> were evaluated in a series of 22 factorial experiments. The solubility of <b>lornoxicam</b> in the four selected fluids as per 22 factorial study in each case was determined (n= 4).

Combination of Hydroxy propyl βCD with surfactants, SLS and Tween 80 has resulted in a much higher enhancement in the solubility of <b>lornoxicam</b> than is possible with them individually. ANOVA indicated that the individual main effects of HPβCD, SLS and Tween 80 as well as the combined effects in enhancing the solubility and dissolution rate of <b>lornoxicam</b> are highly significant (P< 0. 01). HPβCD alone gave 1. 53 fold increase in the solubility of <b>lornoxicam.</b> Whereas in combination with SLS and Tween 80 it gave respectively 31. 43 and 13. 20 fold increase in the solubility of <b>lornoxicam.</b> Lornoxicam- HPβCD and lornoxicam- HPβCD- Surfactant complexes gave rapid and higher dissolution of <b>lornoxicam</b> when compared to <b>lornoxicam</b> pure drug.

40|$|Introduction: One of {{the most}} {{important}} priorities in therapy is pain control. Therefore, many different groups of drugs are being used for this purpose, primarily opioid analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Opioid analgesic tramadol, by binding to specific receptors, modulates the perception and response to painful stimuli and inhibits transmitting and further processing of pain impulses. <b>Lornoxicam,</b> which belongs to the oxicam class of NSAIDs, is a non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor with strong analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, and better tolerance profile. Preliminary research, which requires further verification, suggests that <b>lornoxicam</b> may be a better alternative or adjunctive therapy to opioid analgesics in the treatment of moderate to severe pain. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate antinociceptive effects of <b>lornoxicam,</b> as well as the combination of <b>lornoxicam</b> with tramadol. Methods: Analgesic effect of combination of <b>lornoxicam</b> and tramadol or <b>lornoxicam</b> applied alone was examined on female albino mice, using a hot plate method. Measurements were made 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after intraperitoneal and subcutaneous administration, in dose of 10 mg/kg. Results: Combination of <b>lornoxicam</b> and tramadol, applied intraperitoneally, increases the threshold of sensitivity to painful stimuli, which was not the case with subcutaneous administration.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{postoperative}} analgesic efficacy and safety of <b>lornoxicam</b> versus etoricoxib for the first 48 hours after surgery. Methods: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study on 110 patients ASAI-II scheduled for TKA under spinal anesthesia, who received either <b>lornoxicam</b> 8 mg PO at the end of surgery and a further 8 mg after 12 hours (<b>Lornoxicam</b> Group) or etoricoxib 120 mg at the end of surgery and one placebo pill after 12 hours (Etoricoxib Group). The primary outcome measure was the cumulative dose of morphine administered during the first postoperative 24 and 48 hours. Secondary outcomes were duration of analgesia and the side effects of the treatment. Results: The groups were similar in terms of demographic data. There are no significant differences between groups regarding the morphine consumption at 24 hours (36. 2 ± 12 in <b>Lornoxicam</b> group and 34. 5 ± 14. 1 in Etoricoxib group) and 48 hours postoperatively (15. 6 ± 12. 8 in <b>Lornoxicam</b> group and 18 ± 12. 3 in Etoricoxib group) or between the duration of analgesia (314. 5 ± 70. 4 in <b>Lornoxicam</b> group and 320. 4 ± 89. 2 in Etoricoxib group).

Material and Method: After approval of the Hospital Ethic Committee of Atatürk University, Erzurum, Turkey, The study included 120 ASA I or II, patients aged between 18 to 70 years, scheduled to undergo elective abdominal surgery (midline incision surgery). Patients were randomly divided into four groups. In all cases, anesthesia was induced with 2 mg/kg propofol and 0. 6 mg/kg rocuronium. Anesthesia was maintained by using 1 - 1. 5 % sevoflurane in 60 % 40 % nitrous oxide - O 2. Group control (Group C, n= 30) : received intravenous (i. v.) fentanyl through Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) Group <b>Lornoxicam</b> (Group L, n= 30) : a one-time 8 mg dose of i. v. <b>lornoxicam</b> was added, which was completed approximately 30 minutes before intubation.; Group paracetamol (Group P, n= 30) : received 1 g i. v. paracetamol before intubation, followed by every 6 hours for a total of four times. Group <b>lornoxicam</b> and paracetamol (Group PL, n= 30) : received 8 mg i. v. <b>lornoxicam</b> before intubation, and 1 g i. v. paracetamol before intubation every 6 hours for a total of 4 times. During the postoperative 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours, visual analogue scale (VAS), sedation, and nausea-vomiting scores, patient satisfaction, incidence of {{side effects and}} total amount of fentanyl used were recorded. Results: Total postoperative fentanyl consumption was significantly higher in GC than of the other groups. At 2, 8, 12, 24. hours, fentanyl consumption was found to be significantly lower in GL than that in GC. In GPL, fentanyl consumption was significantly lower than in GC at all time points. Discussion: We observed that preemptive 8 mg <b>lornoxicam</b> decreased PCA fentanyl consumption but a combination of <b>lornoxicam</b> and paracetamol was not superior to <b>lornoxicam</b> alone...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Moderate {{lysosomal}} membrane permeabilization is {{an important}} inducer of apoptosis. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the harmful hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity effects induced by short and long term administration of paracetamol, nimesulide, and <b>lornoxicam</b> drugs in rats. Results revealed that liver and kidney lysosomal enzymes activities (ACP, β-NAG and β-GAL) were significantly increased by paracetamol followed by nimesulide in acute study as compared with chronic study, while no changes were observed in lysosomal enzymes of <b>lornoxicam</b> group in both studies. Serum liver enzymes activities (AST, ALT and γ-GT) and (urea and creatinine) levels were significantly increased by paracetamol followed by nimesulide and <b>lornoxicam</b> in chronic study as compared with acute study. Liver and kidney GSH levels and antioxidant enzymes activities were significantly decreased by paracetamol followed by nimesulide in acute study as compared with chronic study, while no changes were observed by <b>lornoxicam</b> in both organs either in acute or chronic studies. Liver and kidney MDA levels were significantly increased by paracetamol followed by nimesulide in acute study as compared to chronic study. These results demonstrated that liver and kidney functions were affected by oxidative stress greatly by paracetamol than nimesulide or <b>lornoxicam</b> in both studies...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives: In this study, {{our goal}} was to compare {{intraoperative}} and postoperative analgesic effects of <b>lornoxicam</b> and fentanyl when added to lidocaine Intravenous Regional Anesthesia (IVRA) in a group of outpatients who underwent hand surgery. Methods: This is a double blind randomized study. A total of 45 patients were included, randomized into three groups. Patients in Group I (L) received 3 mg. kg- 1 of 2 % lidocaine 40 mL; patients in Group II (LL) received 3 mg. kg- 1 lidocaine 38 mL + 2 mL lornoxicam; patients in Group III (LF) received 3 mg. kg- 1 lidocaine 38 mL + 2 mL fentanyl. Our primary outcome was fi rst analgesic requirement time at postoperative period. Results: <b>Lornoxicam</b> added to lidocaine IVRA increased the sensory block recovery time without increasing side effects and increased fi rst analgesic requirement time at the postoperative period when compared to lidocaine IVRA (p 0. 05) although VAS scores related to tourniquet pain were lower in fentanyl group. <b>Lornoxicam</b> added to lidocaine IVRA was not superior to lidocaine IVRA in decreasing tourniquet pain. Conclusions: Addition of fentanyl to lidocaine IVRA seems to be superior to lidocaine IVRA and <b>lornoxicam</b> added to lidocaine IVRA groups in decreasing tourniquet pain at the expense of increasing side effects. However, <b>lornoxicam</b> did not increase side effects while providing intraoperative and postoperative analgesia. Therefore, <b>lornoxicam</b> could be more appropriate for clinical use...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the therapeutic action {{and safety of}} <b>lornoxicam,</b> a new non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, in 2 oral daily dose regimens of 8 and 16 mg in comparison with oral diclofenac 150 mg/day in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: Double blind double-dummy cross-over, controlled trial. The two treatments were given for ten-day periods, separated by a three-day wash-out interval. Patients of both sexes with classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis according to the A. R. A. criteria {{were enrolled in the}} study. Results: Fourteen patients (12 F, 2 M) were admitted, mean age 61. 6 years ± 6. 7 (±SD), duration of illness 12. 7 years ± 11. 9. <b>Lornoxicam</b> 8 and 16 mg/day showed a good therapeutic activity, comparable with diclofenac 150 mg/day. Two patients complained adverse events with diclofenac. Conclusions: <b>Lornoxicam</b> 16 mg/day was associated with a more sharp action and a better tolerability than diclofenac in rheumatoid arthritis. The twice a day dosage of <b>lornoxicam</b> revealed to be appropriate...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lornoxicam,</b> {{a widely}} {{prescribed}} anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug belongs to class II under BCS and exhibit low and variable oral bioavailability {{due to its}} poor aqueous solubility. It is practically insoluble in water and aqueous fluids. As such its oral absorption is dissolution rate limited and it requires enhancement in solubility and dissolution rate for increasing its oral bioavailability. The objective {{of the present study}} is to enhance the solubility and dissolution rate of <b>lornoxicam</b> employing Hydroxy propyl β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) and two surfactants (SLS and Tween 80) alone and in combination. The individual main effects and combined (interaction) effects of HPβcyclodextrin and surfactants on the solubility and dissolution rate of <b>lornoxicam</b> were evaluated in a series of 2 2 factorial experiments. The solubility of <b>lornoxicam</b> in the four selected fluids as per 2 2 factorial study in each case was determined (n= 4). Lornoxicam-βCD-surfactant inclusion complexes were prepared employing the selected combinations of HPβC...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and Aim. With the {{implementation}} of multimodal analgesia regimens, Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are often administered for optimal pain control and reduction of opioid use. The aim {{of the study was}} to examine the effects of <b>lornoxicam,</b> a NSAID, on anastomotic healing employing an animal model. Materials and Methods. A total of 28 Wistar rats were randomly assigned in two groups. All animals underwent ascending colonic transection followed by an end-to-end hand sewn anastomosis. Group 1 received intraperitoneally <b>lornoxicam</b> before and daily after surgery. Group 2 received intraperitoneally an equal volume of placebo. Half of the animals in each group were euthanized on the 3 rd pod and the remaining on the 7 th pod. Macro- and microscopic indicators of anastomotic healing were compared using a two-tailed Fisher exact test. Results. The <b>lornoxicam</b> group significantly decreased fibroblast in growth and reepithelization of the mucosa at the anastomotic site on the 3 rd pod and significantly increased occurrence of deep reaching defects, necrosis, and microabscess on the 7 th pod. Conclusion. <b>Lornoxicam</b> administration during the perioperative period adversely affects histologic parameters of intestinal anastomotic healing. These effects of <b>lornoxicam</b> administration were not found to induce significant increase of anastomotic dehiscence in the rat model...|$|E
