5000|$|... ''''Right and Left Grand'''', {{also known}} as ''''Grand Right and Left'''', is a square dance move in which all eight dancers in the set, moving in a {{circular}} fashion, execute a series of four alternating hand pull-bies (right pull <b>by,</b> <b>left</b> pull <b>by,</b> right pull <b>by,</b> <b>left</b> pull <b>by).</b> Men (or gents) travel counter-clockwise around the ring, and ladies travel clockwise. The result is that all dancers end up half way across the set facing the same person they started with.|$|R
50|$|From 1965 {{organised}} internal groups {{emerged to}} challenge {{the control of the}} <b>Left,</b> supported <b>by</b> figures such as John Button and Gough Whitlam.

25|$|H.A. Rey has {{suggested}} {{an alternative to}} the traditional visualization that connected the stars of Gemini to show twins holding hands. Pollux's torso is represented by the star υ Gem, Pollux's right hand by ι Gem, Pollux's <b>left</b> hand <b>by</b> κ Gem; all three of these stars are of the fourth magnitude. Pollux's pelvis is represented by the star δ Gem, Pollux's right knee by ζ Gem, Pollux's right foot by γ Gem, Pollux's <b>left</b> knee <b>by</b> λ Gem, and Pollux's <b>left</b> foot <b>by</b> ξ Gem. γ Gem is of the second magnitude, while δ and ξ Gem are of the third magnitude. Castor's torso is represented by the star τ Gem, Castor's <b>left</b> hand <b>by</b> ι Gem (which he shares with Pollux), Castor's right hand by θ Gem; all three of these stars are of the fourth magnitude. Castor's pelvis is represented by the star ε Gem, Castor's <b>left</b> foot <b>by</b> ν Gem, and Castor's right foot by μ Gem and η Gem; ε, μ, and η Gem are of the third magnitude. The brightest star in this constellation is Pollux.|$|R

5|$|A herd {{lives on}} the Rachel Carson {{component}} of the North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve, a series of five small islands and several salt marshes. There were no horses at the Sanctuary until the 1940s.

The sketches would usually culminate with the guests storming off.|$|E

5|$|After it {{fell into}} disuse during the Bronze Age, Maeshowe was re-opened and used centuries later by Vikings from about the 9th to the 12th centuries AD. The Norsemen left {{a series of}} runic {{inscriptions}} on the stone walls of the chamber, {{some of which were}} <b>left</b> <b>by</b> a group of crusaders in the winter of 115354. Over thirty individual inscriptions remain, one of the largest such collections in Europe.|$|E
5|$|After one {{additional}} lap had been run, IndyCar officials red-flagged the race as the track was {{not suitable for}} racing.

5|$|After {{the demise}} of the Susquehannocks, the lands of the Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who also lived in longhouses, {{primarily}} in what is now the state of New York. The Iroquois had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers. To fill the void <b>left</b> <b>by</b> {{the demise of}} the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the Susquehanna watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).|$|E

5|$|After the war, the Mimoyecques site lay abandoned. Much of the {{equipment}} <b>left</b> <b>by</b> the Germans was disposed of as scrap metal. A complete set of four steel plates, weighing 60 tons, that were intended to protect the entrances to the drifts were bought by {{the manager of the}} Hidrequent-Rixent quarries to be cut up for use in rock-crushing machinery. Rediscovered by local historians in the 1990s, they remained at the quarries until 2010, when the surviving plates were returned to Mimoyecques, where they are now on display.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{the lands}} of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois.

5|$|Around {{this central}} motif are {{arranged}} elements of eight other stories, {{all of them}} represented {{at least in part}} by sets of footprints. Human footprints include a set <b>left</b> <b>by</b> dancing women from a place called Aileron; another shows a family group travelling to a place called Ngama, and a third trail is that of a Tjungurrayi man, which lead to his skeleton, representing his death after committing the crime of trying to steal sacred items. Animal representations include tracks of a cluster of emus from a place called Napperby, on the artist's country, as well as those <b>left</b> <b>by</b> the rock wallaby, or Mala, men journeying north from Port Augusta in South Australia, as well as, on the left hand edge of the picture, those of two groups of dingoes going to a place called Warrabri. A little closer to the centre of the painting are marks representing a dreaming called the Chase of the Goanna Men. Throughout the work, Upambura the Possum Man's footsteps follow the wandering lines that give the painting its overall structure.|$|E

5|$|As a drought-deciduous {{succulent}} tree, B. rupestris adapts {{readily to}} cultivation and is tolerant {{of a range}} of soils and temperatures. It is a key component and emergent tree in the endangered central semi-evergreen vine thickets—also known as bottletree scrub—of the Queensland Brigalow Belt. Remnant trees are often <b>left</b> <b>by</b> farmers on cleared land for their value as shade and fodder trees.|$|E

5|$|By 1913, {{the revival}} at Azusa Street had lost momentum, {{and most of}} the media {{attention}} and crowds had <b>left</b> <b>by</b> 1915.

After Seymour died of a heart attack on September 28, 1922, Jennie led the church until 1931, when the congregation lost the building.|$|E
