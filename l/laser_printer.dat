It was printed on Mohawk Superfine text by the Sun Hill Press, with the {{reproduction}} of the etchings printed on a Canon <b>laser</b> <b>printer.</b> The edition was then Smythe sewn at Spectrum Bindery and enclosed in a solander box. A bronze-boxed collectors' copy was also released, and retailed at $7,500.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{black is}} used as the black pigment in {{printing}} ink, artist's oil paint and water colours, carbon paper, automotive finishes, India ink and <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> toner. Carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal {{is used as}} an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification, and kitchen extractor hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make {{up most of the}} materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass, stone and metal.|$|E

50|$|An {{in depth}} {{comparison}} of inkjet and <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> suggest that <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> are the ideal {{choice for a}} high quality, volume printer, while inkjet printers {{tend to focus on}} large-format printers and household units. <b>Laser</b> <b>printers</b> offer more precise edging and in-depth mono-chromatic color, but tend to cost more than a traditional inkjet printer.|$|R
50|$|Although corona {{discharge}} is usually undesirable, until recently {{it was essential}} {{in the operation of}} photocopiers (xerography) and <b>laser</b> <b>printers.</b> Many modern copiers and <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> now charge the photoconductor drum with an electrically conductive roller, reducing undesirable indoor ozone pollution.|$|R

25|$|A <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> is {{a common}} type of {{computer}} printer that rapidly produces high quality text and graphics on plain paper. The <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> was invented at Xerox in 1969 by researcher Gary Starkweather, who had an improved printer working by 1971 and incorporated into a fully functional networked printer system by about a year later.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> {{designed}} for use with an individual computer was released with the Xerox Star 8010 in 1981. Although it was innovative, the Star was an expensive ($17,000) system that was only purchased by {{a small number of}} laboratories and institutions. After personal computers became more widespread, the first <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> intended for a mass market was the HP LaserJet 8ppm, released in 1984, using a Canon engine controlled by HP software. The HP LaserJet printer was quickly followed by other laser printers from Brother Industries, IBM, and others.|$|E
25|$|The <b>laser</b> <b>printer,</b> {{based on}} a {{modified}} xerographic copier, was invented at Xerox in 1969 by researcher Gary Starkweather, who had a fully functional networked printer system working by 1971. Laser printing eventually became a multibillion-dollar business for Xerox.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, Stallman {{and some}} other hackers at the AI Lab were refused access to the source code for the {{software}} of a newly installed <b>laser</b> <b>printer,</b> the Xerox 9700. Stallman had modified the software for the Lab's previous <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> (the XGP, Xerographic Printer), so it electronically messaged a user when the person's job was printed, and would message all logged-in users waiting for print jobs if the printer was jammed. Not being able to add these features to the new printer was a major inconvenience, as the printer was on a different floor {{from most of the}} users. This experience convinced Stallman of people's {{need to be able to}} freely modify the software they use.|$|E
25|$|Most {{noteworthy}} was {{the role}} the <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> played in popularizing desktop publishing {{with the introduction of}} the Apple LaserWriter for the Apple Macintosh, along with Aldus PageMaker software, in 1985. With these products, users could create documents that would previously have required professional typesetting.|$|E
25|$|Computers and {{the first}} <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> were added during the Carter administration, {{and the use of}} {{computer}} technology was expanded during the Reagan administration. A Carter-era innovation, a set of solar water heating panels that were mounted {{on the roof of the}} White House, was removed during Reagan's presidency. Redecorations were made to the private family quarters and maintenance was made to public areas during the Reagan years. The house was accredited as a museum in 1988.|$|E

25|$|The 68000 {{also saw}} great success as an {{embedded}} controller. As early as 1981, laser printers {{such as the}} Imagen Imprint-10 were controlled by external boards equipped with the 68000. The first HP LaserJet—introduced in 1984—came with a built-in 8MHz 68000. Other printer manufacturers adopted the 68000, including Apple with its introduction of the LaserWriter in 1985, the first PostScript <b>laser</b> <b>printer.</b> The 68000 continued to be widely used in printers {{throughout the rest of}} the 1980s, persisting well into the 1990s in low-end printers.|$|E
25|$|The Macintosh {{initially}} sold well, but follow-up {{sales were}} not strong {{due to its}} high price and limited range of software titles. The machine's fortunes changed {{with the introduction of}} the LaserWriter, the first PostScript <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> to be sold at a reasonable price, and PageMaker, an early desktop publishing package. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market. The Macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.|$|E
25|$|Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I {{personal}} computer. The visionaries gained {{fame and}} wealth {{a year later}} for the Apple II, {{one of the first}} highly successful mass-produced personal computers. In 1979, after a tour of PARC, Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984. In addition to being the first mass-produced computer with a GUI, the Macintosh introduced the sudden rise of the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> to feature vector graphics. Following a long power struggle, Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985.|$|E

Simon Massey of the BBC stated that the people of Elmina had been [...] "extremely supportive" [...] and played a large role during filming, and that the donated equipment was a way of giving something back to the community.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{commercial}} {{implementation of a}} <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> was the IBM model 3800 in 1976, used for high-volume printing of documents such as invoices and mailing labels. It is often cited as [...] "taking up a whole room," [...] implying {{that it was a}} primitive version of the later familiar device used with a personal computer. While large, it was designed for an entirely different purpose. Many 3800s are still in use.|$|E
2500|$|For {{a number}} of years after its introduction, the Selectric Composer was {{considered}} to be a highly desirable, powerful desk-sized cold type setting system, affordable by small businesses and organizations. It was usually leased, including a service contract for the skilled labor required to fix and adjust it. [...] The Selectric Composer was accorded respect and affection among small publishers, unrivaled until the appearance of the Apple Macintosh, <b>laser</b> <b>printer,</b> and desktop publishing software. Ultimately the system proved a transitional product, as it was displaced by cheaper phototypesetting, and then in the 1980s by word processors and general-purpose computers.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980s, memory chips {{were still}} very expensive, {{which is why}} {{entry-level}} <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> in that era always came with four-digit suggested retail prices in US dollars.

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of electrostatic phenomena, from those as simple as the attraction of the plastic wrap to your hand after you remove it from a package to the apparently spontaneous explosion of grain silos, the damage of electronic components during manufacturing, and photocopier & <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> operation. Electrostatics involves the buildup of charge {{on the surface of}} objects due to contact with other surfaces. Although charge exchange happens whenever any two surfaces contact and separate, the effects of charge exchange are usually only noticed when {{at least one of the}} surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow. [...] This is because the charges that transfer are trapped there for a time long enough for their effects to be observed. [...] These charges then remain on the object until they either bleed off to ground or are quickly neutralized by a discharge: e.g., the familiar phenomenon of a static 'shock' is caused by the neutralization of charge built up in the body from contact with insulated surfaces.|$|E
