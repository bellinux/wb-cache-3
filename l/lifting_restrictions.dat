500|$|Reagan {{suffered}} a fall at his Bel Air home on January 13, 2001, {{resulting in a}} broken hip. The fracture was repaired the following day and the 89-year-old Reagan returned home later that week, although he faced difficult physical therapy at home. On February 6, 2001, Reagan {{reached the age of}} 90, becoming the third former president to do so (the other two being John Adams and Herbert Hoover, with Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush and Jimmy Carter later reaching 90). Reagan's public appearances became much less frequent with the progression of the disease, and as a result, his family decided that he would live in quiet semi-isolation with his wife Nancy. Nancy Reagan told CNN's Larry King in 2001 that very few visitors were allowed to see her husband because she felt that [...] "Ronnie would want people to remember him as he was." [...] After her husband's diagnosis and death, Nancy Reagan became a stem-cell research advocate, urging Congress and President George W. Bush to support federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research, something Bush opposed. In 2009, she praised President Barack Obama for <b>lifting</b> <b>restrictions</b> on such research. Nancy Reagan said that she believed it could lead to a cure for Alzheimer's.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to political turmoil in Ukraine in early 2014, Paul initially {{said that the}} United States should remain mindful {{of the fact that}} although the Cold War is over, Russia remains a military power with long-range nuclear missiles. He said that the United States should try to maintain a [...] "respectful relationship with Russia" [...] and avoid taking actions that the Russians might view as a provocation, such as seeking to have Ukraine join NATO or otherwise interfering in Russia's relationship with Ukraine. Two weeks later, after the Russian parliament authorized {{the use of military force}} in Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered military exercises along Russia's border with Ukraine, Paul began taking a different tone. He wrote: [...] "Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is a gross violation of that nation's sovereignty and an affront to the international community... Putin must be punished for violating the Budapest Memorandum, and Russia must learn that the U.S. will isolate it if it insists on acting like a rogue nation." [...] He said that the United States and European allies could retaliate against Russia's military aggression without any need for military action. He urged that the United States impose economic sanctions on Russia and resume an effort to build ]. He also called for the United States to take steps as a counterweight to Russia's strategic influence on Europe's oil and gas supply, such as <b>lifting</b> <b>restrictions</b> on new exploration and drilling for fossil fuels in the United States along with immediate approval of the controversial Keystone Pipeline, which he said would allow the United States to ship more oil and gas to Europe if Russia attempts to cut off its own supply to Europe.|$|E

2500|$|Obama {{supports}} {{embryonic stem}} cell research and was a co-sponsor of the 2005 Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act which was passed by both houses of Congress but vetoed by President Bush. Obama condemned Bush's veto, saying, [...] "Democrats want this bill to pass. Conservative, pro-life Republicans want this bill to pass. By large margins, the American people want this bill to pass. It is only the White House {{standing in the way of}} progress – standing in the way of so many potential cures." [...] He also voted in favor of the 2007 bill <b>lifting</b> <b>restrictions</b> on {{embryonic stem cell}} research that was passed but was also vetoed by President Bush.|$|E
2500|$|Cincinnati {{depended}} on {{trade with the}} slave states south of the Ohio River, {{at a time when}} thousands of blacks were settling in the free state of Ohio, most from Kentucky and Virginia and some of them fugitives seeking freedom in the North. Many came to find work in Cincinnati. In the antebellum years, the majority of native-born whites in the city came from northern states, primarily Pennsylvania. In 1841 26 percent of whites were from the South and 57 percent from the eastern states, primarily Pennsylvania. They retained their cultural support for slavery.

2500|$|In {{the daily}} Amidah prayer, the central prayer in Jewish services, the {{petitions}} {{to accept the}} [...] "fire offerings of Israel" [...] and [...] "the grain-offering of Judah and Jerusalem" [...] (Malachi 3:4) are removed. In the special Mussaf Amidah prayer said on Shabbat and Jewish holidays, the Hebrew phrase na'ase ve'nakriv (we will present and sacrifice) is modified to read to asu ve'hikrivu (they presented and sacrificed), implying that sacrifices are {{a thing of the}} past. The prayer for the restoration of [...] "the House of our lives" [...] and the Shekhinah to dwell [...] "among us" [...] in the weekday Torah reading service is retained in Conservative prayer books, although not all Conservative services say it. In Conservative prayer books, words and phrases that have dual meaning, referring to both Temple features and theological or poetic concepts, are generally retained. Translations and commentaries, however, generally refer to the poetic or theological meanings only. Conservative Judaism also takes an intermediate position on Kohanim and Levites, preserving patrilineal tribal descent and some aspects of their roles, but <b>lifting</b> <b>restrictions</b> on whom Kohanim are permitted to marry.|$|E
2500|$|John Bolton, then U.S. {{ambassador}} to the United Nations on 31 August 2006, said that he expected action to impose sanctions to begin immediately after the deadline passes, with meetings of high-level officials in the coming days, followed by negotiations on {{the language of the}} sanctions resolution. Bolton said that when the deadline passes [...] "a little flag will go up." [...] "In terms of what happens afterward, at that point, if they have not suspended all uranium enrichment activities, they will not be in compliance with the resolution," [...] he said. [...] "And at that point, the steps that the foreign ministers have agreed upon previously... we would begin to talk about how to implement those steps." [...] The five permanent members of the Security Council, plus Germany, previously offered Iran a package of incentives aimed at getting the country to restart negotiations, but Iran refused to halt its nuclear activities first. Incentives included offers to improve Iran's access to the international economy through participation in groups such as the World Trade Organization and to modernize its telecommunications industry. The incentives also mentioned the possibility of <b>lifting</b> <b>restrictions</b> on U.S. and European manufacturers wanting to export civil aircraft to Iran.
