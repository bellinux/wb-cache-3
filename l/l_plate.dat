40|$|Abstract: Mammalian {{ingestion}} of jervane, solanidane, and spirosolane steroidal alkaloids produces craniofacial congenital malformations in offspring upon administration during the primitive s t rdneura <b>l</b> <b>plate</b> developmental phase. Structure-terata {{studies have shown}} that hamster teratogenicity induced by steroidal alkaloids is primarily related to the presence of C- 5, C- 6 unsaturation and secondarily to the molecular configuration at C- 22 (spirosolanes and solanidanes). Teratogenic potencies of jervanes and solanidanes are appreciably higher than those of spirosolanes whereas the potency of jervanes is generally greater than that of solanidanes. The enhanced teratogenicity of functionalized steroidal alkaloids implies that their amphiphilic nature may be important in facilitating their passage of the embryonic membrane...|$|E

That is,the distance between the electrodes (S) is much smaller than the length (L) or width (W) of the electrodes. Consideration of the material balance quations in light of this small aspect ratio (S/L) condition leads to predictions of de-rived quantities of interest (e. g., current efficiency) that depend on the product of the aspect ratio and the Peclet number, where Pe = 2 VavgS/DR. Predictions of such derived quantities are made for electrolysis of an aqueous, hydrochloric acid solution containing copper in a cell with no separator.

SiO 2 flux powder along with acetone is selected for A-TIG welding of austenitic stainless steel plate 304 <b>L</b> <b>plate</b> of 6 mm thickness. The major influencing A-TIG welding process parameters, such as electrode gap, welding current, welding speed and gas flow rate are optimized to get desirable ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of weld. Hence this parameters are optimized by L 9 (3 4 orthogonal array and percentage contribution of each parameter if calculated by ANOVA a tool of Taguchi method. From experimental results it is observed that, the optimum process parameter are 1 mm electrode gap, 200 A welding current, 100 mm/min welding speed and 10 lit/min gas flow rate. The percentage contribution of process parameters for tensile strength are welding speed (44. 87 %), welding current (28. 14 %), arc gap (20. 85 %) and gas flow rate (6. 12 %) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} European network NeT round robin {{activities}} on measuring and simulating the residual stresses generated by laying a single weld bead {{on a flat}} austenitic steel plate. The activities are described, as are the main results obtained. From 2002 to 2010, fourteen independent sets of residual stress measurements were made using five different techniques, and subjected to detailed statistical analysis to evaluate best estimate profiles for validation of finite element predictions. In parallel, over forty finite element simulations were performed, examining {{a wide range of}} solution variables and their impact on the predicted residual stresses. This large body of work has allowed NeT Task Group 1 to develop a reliable thermal solution strategy. This is described and involves a global weld heat input calibrated against far field thermocouples followed by derivation of detailed weld heat source characteristics by matching the weld fusion boundary profile. The accurate thermal solutions then allow the most important mechanical solution variables to be isolated and optimised. An important variable is found to be the material hardening model, with mixed isotropic kinematic hardening being the most accurate for the AISI 316 <b>L</b> <b>plate</b> material. Other solution variables, such as the welding efficiency, the mesh design and the thermal boundary conditions, are found to be of much less importance. The NeT TG 1 specimen is described here in sufficient detail to serve as a benchmark for both finite element simulation and measurement of weld residual stresse...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} biomechanical {{strength}} of a modified dorsal double-plating (MDDP) internal fixation on artificial radius bones using the dynamic fatigue test. The plates are 1. 6 mm thick and the upper <b>L</b> <b>plate</b> has an adjustable joint to allow the angular disposition of the bone plate to be changed to secure various bone fracture types. A dual-thread locking screw is used to enhance mechanical retention at the screw/bone interface. A finite element analysis is performed to examine the mechanical bone and fixation system response using a dual-microthread locking screw. An MDDP fixation is made with stainless steel by a manufacturer with ISO 13485 quality management systems. Eighteen radius Sawbones were randomly placed into three groups and cut to a standard length of 2. 5 cm from the articular surface to form 0 °, 30 °, and 60 ° fracture configurations according to the A 2 classification in the AO surgery reference. The adjustable joint in the L plates is adjusted and fixed using a fastener connection to have a 0 °, 30 °, or 60 ° configuration. Plates and screws are then positioned on the dorso-ulnar side for L plates and the dorso-radial side for I plates to create an angle of 90 °. The specimens were subjected to oscillating loads of 10 to 150 N at 5 Hz for 20000 cycles. The average stiffness values after 20000 cycles were 425. 7, 461. 1, and 532. 1 N/mm for the 0 °, 30 °, and 60 ° constructs, respectively. No difference in stiffness was found for constructs with a given angle throughout the 20000 cycles of testing (p> 0. 05).
