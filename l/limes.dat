5|$|By the {{beginning}} of Sasanian rule, a number of buffer states existed between the empires. These were absorbed by the central state over time, and by the 7th century the last buffer state, the Arab Lakhmids, was annexed to the Sasanian Empire. Frye notes that in the 3rd centuryAD such client states {{played an important role}} in RomanSasanian relations, but both empires gradually replaced them by an organized defense system run by the central government and based on a line of fortifications (the <b>limes)</b> and the fortified frontier cities, such as Dara. Towards the end of the 1st centuryAD, Rome organized the protection of its eastern frontiers through the <b>limes</b> system, which lasted until the Muslim conquests of the 7th century after improvements by Diocletian. Like the Romans, the Sasanians constructed defensive walls opposite the territory of their opponents. According to R. N. Frye, it was under Shapur II that the Persian system was extended, probably in imitation of Diocletian's construction of the <b>limes</b> of the Syrian and Mesopotamian frontiers of the Roman Empire. The Roman and Persian border units were known as limitanei and marzobans, respectively.|$|E

50|$|Hydraulic <b>lime</b> (HL) is {{a general}} term for {{varieties}} of <b>lime</b> (calcium oxide), or slaked <b>lime</b> (calcium hydroxide), used to make <b>lime</b> mortar which set through hydration: thus they are called hydraulic.

5|$|Soon after, an {{imperial}} investigation into Gubazes's murder {{brought to light}} Martin's culpability. His military successes spared his life, but cost him his command; he was replaced as magister militum per Armeniam by Justin in spring 557. It was in this capacity that in late 557 Justin received the first Avar embassy to the Byzantine Empire. The Avars, who had fled their ancestral lands in Central Asia before {{the rise of the}} Göktürks, asked for imperial protection and for land to settle on. Justin forwarded them to Constantinople, where they arrived in December. Turned away from the Empire and towards the plains of the Ukraine by Justinian, the Avars defeated enemy after enemy and eventually reached the northeastern bank of the Danube in 561/562. There they again encountered Justin, who had just been transferred to the command of the quaestura exercitus covering the lower Danubian <b>limes</b> (the <b>Limes</b> Moesiae). At this time, the Avars demanded to settle in Byzantine imperial territory in Scythia Minor, whose defences had been devastated by a recent Kotrigur invasion led by Zabergan. Here, Justin played a crucial role and gained great fame, by learning of the Avars' intentions and warning Justinian. Consequently, the Avar embassy to Constantinople was detained while the Byzantine defences were put in order. With Justin continuing to maintain a careful watch over the Danube river, the Avars contented themselves with the annual subsidy paid by Byzantium, and left the Empire in peace for some years to come.|$|E

5|$|The war {{had also}} {{demonstrated}} to the Romans that the defensive {{system in the}} East, as put in place by Augustus, was no longer adequate. Thus the following years saw a major reorganization of the Roman East: the client kingdoms of Pontus and Colchis (in 64 AD), Cilicia, Commagene and Lesser Armenia (in 72 AD) were made into Roman provinces, the number of legions in the area increased, and Roman presence in the Caucasian client states of Iberia and Albania strengthened, {{with the aim of}} strategically encircling Armenia.

5|$|After Varus' {{defeat in}} Germania in the 1st century, Rome had adopted a largely {{defensive}} strategy {{along the border}} with Germania, constructing a line of defences known as <b>limes</b> along the Rhine. Although the exact historicity is unclear, since the Romans often assigned one name to several distinct tribal groups, or conversely applied several names to a single group at different times, some mix of Germanic peoples, Celts, and tribes of mixed Celto-Germanic ethnicity were settled in the lands of Germania from the 1st century onwards. The Cherusci, Bructeri, Tencteri, Usipi, Marsi, and Chatti of Varus' time had by the 3rd century either evolved into or been displaced by a confederacy or alliance of Germanic tribes collectively known as the Alamanni, first mentioned by Cassius Dio describing the campaign of Caracalla in 213 AD.|$|E

5|$|From about 71 CE the Romans began {{military}} expeditions {{into what}} is now Scotland, building forts, like that at Trimontium, and probably pushing north {{as far as the}} River Tay where they created more fortifications, like those at Inchtuthil.

40|$|Modification {{of black}} cotton soils by {{chemical}} admixtures {{is a common}} method for stabilizing the swell-shrink tendency of expansive soils. Advantages of chemical stabilization are that they reduce the swell-shrink tendency of the expansive soils and also render the soils less plastic. Among the chemical stabilization methods for expansive soils, <b>lime</b> stabilization is most widely adopted method for improving the swell-shrink characteristics of expansive soils. <b>Lime</b> stabilization of clays in field is achieved by shallow mixing of <b>lime</b> and soil or by deep stabilization technique. Shallow stabilization involves scarifying the soil to the required depth and <b>lime</b> in powder or slurry form is spread and mixed with the soil using a rotovator. The use of <b>lime</b> as deep stabilizer has been mainly restricted to improve the engineering behaviour of soft clays Deep stabilization using <b>lime</b> can be divided in three main groups: <b>lime</b> columns, <b>lime</b> piles and <b>lime</b> slurry injection. <b>Lime</b> columns refer to creation of deep vertical columns of <b>lime</b> stabilized material. <b>Lime</b> piles are usually holes in the ground filled with <b>lime.</b> <b>Lime</b> slurry pressure injection, as the name suggests, involves {{the introduction of a}} <b>lime</b> slurry into the ground under pressure. Literature review brings out that <b>lime</b> stabilization of expansive clays in field is mainly performed by mixing of <b>lime</b> and soil up to shallow depths. The use of <b>lime</b> as deep stabilizer has been mainly restricted to improve the engineering behaviour of soft clays. Use of <b>lime</b> in deep stabilization of expansive soils however has not been given due attention. There exists a definite need to examine methods for deep stabilization of expansive soils to prevent the deeper soil layers from causing distress to the structures in response to the seasonal climatic variations. In addition, there exists a need for in-situ soil stabilization using <b>lime</b> in case of distressed structures founded on expansive soil deposits. The physical mixing of <b>lime</b> and soil in shallow stabilization method ensures efficient contact between <b>lime</b> and clay particles of the soil. It however has limitation in terms of application as it is only suited for stabilization of expansive soils to relatively shallow depths. Studies available have not compared the relative efficiency of the <b>lime</b> pile technique and lime-soil mixing method in altering the physico-chemical, index and engineering properties of expansive black cotton soils. To achieve the above objectives laboratory experiments are performed that study: 1. 	the efficacy of <b>lime</b> piles in stabilizing compacted black cotton soil specimens from Chitradurga District in Karnataka. The efficiency of <b>lime</b> piles in chemically stabilizing the compacted black cotton soil mass was investigated as a function of: a) amount of <b>lime</b> contained in the <b>lime</b> pile b) radial migration of <b>lime</b> from the central <b>lime</b> pile c) migration of <b>lime</b> as a function of soil depth 2. the relative impact of the <b>lime</b> pile technique and lime-soil mixing method in altering the physico-chemical, index and engineering properties of expansive black cotton soil. The organization of this thesis is as follows After the first introductory chapter, a detailed review of literature performed towards highlighting the need to examine stabilization of expansive soils using <b>lime</b> pile technique is brought out in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 presents a detailed experimental programme of the study. 25 mm and 75 mm diameter <b>lime</b> piles were installed in the compacted soil mass to study the influence of amount of <b>lime</b> contained in the <b>lime</b> pile on the soil properties. The amount of quick <b>lime</b> contained in the 25 mm and 75 mm <b>lime</b> piles corresponded to 1 % and 3 % by dry weight of the soil mass respectively. Radial and vertical migration of <b>lime</b> from the central <b>lime</b> pile was examined by sampling soil specimens at different radial distances from the central <b>lime</b> pile and at different depths of soil sample. At a given depth and radial distance, migration of <b>lime</b> was estimated by comparing the exchangeable cation composition, pH and pore salinity of the treated soil with that of the natural (untreated) black cotton soil specimen. Alterations in the soil engineering properties at a given depth and radial distance were evaluated by comparing the index properties, swell potential and unconfined compressive strength of the <b>lime</b> pile treated soil specimen with those of the untreated specimen. To compare the relative efficiency of <b>lime</b> mixing and <b>lime</b> pile technique in altering the swelling behaviour of black cotton soil, batches of black cotton soil specimens were treated with 1 % and 3 % quick <b>lime</b> on dry soil weight basis. The compacted soil-lime mixes were cured at moisture contents of 31 - 34 % for a period of 10 days. The physico-chemical, index and engineering properties of the 1 % <b>lime</b> mixed specimens are compared with those of the 25 mm <b>lime</b> pile treated specimens. The properties of the 3 % <b>lime</b> mixed soil specimens are compared with those of the 75 mm <b>lime</b> pile treated specimens. Chapter 4 examines the efficacy of <b>lime</b> piles in stabilizing compacted black cotton soil specimens from Chitradurga District in Karnataka. Experimental results showed that controlling the swell potential of deep expansive soil deposits is possible by the <b>lime</b> pile technique. Treatment with <b>lime</b> pile caused migration of dissociated calcium and hydroxyl ions into the surrounding soil mass. In case of 25 mm <b>lime</b> pile, the experimental setup allowed measurement of migration of <b>lime</b> up to three times the <b>lime</b> pile diameter. In case of 75 mm <b>lime</b> pile, the experimental setup allowed measurement of migration of <b>lime</b> up to 1. 6 times pile diameter. In both experiments, migration of <b>lime</b> was also uniform through out the soil depth of 280 mm. Migration of calcium and hydroxyl ions increased the pore salinity and pH of the treated soil mass. The increase in pH caused clustering of additional exchangeable calcium ions at the negative clay particle edges. The increased pore salinity and exchangeable calcium ions reduced the diffuse ion layer thickness that in turn suppressed the plasticity index and the swell potential of the compacted expansive soil. The laboratory results hence bring out that <b>lime</b> pile treatment in the field can substantially reduce the swell potential of the soil at least to a radial extent of 2 to 3 times the <b>lime</b> pile diameter. The 75 mm <b>lime</b> pile contained <b>lime</b> content in excess of the initial consumption of <b>lime</b> (ICL) value of the black cotton soil - namely 2. 6 %. Laboratory results showed that migration of hydroxyl ions even from the 75 mm pile could not elevate the soil pH to levels required for soil-lime pozzoIonic reactions (pH ≥ 12). The very low solubility of <b>lime</b> in water (< 1 g/litre) and the impervious nature of the black cotton soil are considered to have impeded efficient interactions between <b>lime</b> and soil in course of treatment of the expansive soil with <b>lime</b> piles. Absence of soil-lime pozzolonic reactions precluded the formation of cementation compounds in the <b>lime</b> pile treated soil specimens. Cementation compounds formed by the soil-lime pozzolonic reactions are responsible for the much higher strengths of <b>lime</b> stabilized soils. Consequently, treatment with 25 mm pile had no impact on the unconfined compressive strength of the black cotton soil. Comparatively, treatment with 75 mm <b>lime</b> pile slightly increased the strength of the treated soil due to increased inter-particle attraction and particle flocculation. Chapter 5 compares the relative efficiency of the <b>lime</b> pile technique and lime-soil mixing method in altering the physico-chemical, index and engineering properties of expansive black cotton soil. Experimental results showed that mixing of soil and <b>lime</b> promote stronger chemical interactions between <b>lime</b> released hydroxyl ions and clay particles than that achieved by diffusion of <b>lime</b> from a central <b>lime</b> pile. The more alkaline pH of the <b>lime</b> mixed soil specimens rendered the clay particle edges more negative. Consequently, more calcium ions were adsorbed at the clay particle edges of the <b>lime</b> mixed soil specimens imparting them higher exchangeable calcium contents than the <b>lime</b> pile treated soil specimens. Also, at 3 % <b>lime</b> addition, the pH of the lime-mixed soil was sufficiently high (in excess of 12) to cause dissolution of silica and alumina from the clay lattice necessary for the formation of cementation compounds. The stronger <b>lime</b> modification reactions plus the lime-soil pozzolonic reactions (applicable for soil treated with <b>lime</b> content greater than ICL value) achieved by the <b>lime</b> mixing technique rendered the expansive soil much less plastic, much less expansive and much stronger than the <b>lime</b> pile treated specimens. The results of the laboratory study hence suggest that if a choice exists in the field between conventional method of spreading-mixing-compacting of soil-lime mixes and treating the ground with <b>lime</b> piles, the former technique should be adopted because of its greater efficacy in stabilizing the expansive soil. Chapter 6 summarizes the findings of the study...|$|R
