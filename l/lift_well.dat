40|$|The present Master’s thesis {{reports the}} study of {{continuous}} gas lift for a production oil well. The objective of the present work is {{a better understanding of}} processes occurring in a gas <b>lift</b> <b>well,</b> as well as optimization of the gas lift system. Numerical simulation for a gas <b>lift</b> <b>well</b> was carried out by means of Matlab. The program and a step-by-step guide were developed on the basis on nodal analysis, with implementation of the Lyapkov’s methodic; the program calculates pressure distribution curves along with local mixture properties along the wellbore in tubing and annulus space for steady state flow of multiphase mixture. The gas lift simulation has been performed for different gas injection rates to see how the liquid production will increase. For experimental purposes, a 5 m experimental loop was used. All experiments were carried out with tap water as reservoir fluid and compressed treated air from the atmosphere as injection gas. A range (from 0, 01 to 5 standard liters per minute) of different gas injection rates were chosen to observe a shape of the liquid production curve. Finally, experimental results are to be confirmed by calculations, based on Bernoulli’s equation for the experimental setup. During the experiments it was a great luck to install and use a new gas flowmeter provided by Alicat Company and a Sensirion SQT-QL 500 liquid flowmeter...|$|E

One concept was a strake-like extension introduced across the wing crank, whose vortex helps to stabilize the outer-wing flow and alleviate tip stall. The other was a lower-surface cavity flap employed to trap a vortex just beneath the inboard leading edge, resulting in reduced vortex lift over the inner-wing panel. Each of these concepts was shown to eliminate the high-alpha pitch up, potentially raising the maximum usable lift of the cranked wing practically to its C(sub L,max) value...|$|E
30|$|Most ESP {{installations}} {{are designed}} to operate using electricity at a fixed frequency, usually 60 or 50  Hz. This implies that the ESP pump runs at a constant speed and develops different heads for different pumping rates as predicted by its published performance curve. When designing for a constant production rate, a pump type with the desired rate inside of its recommended capacity range is selected. The number of the required pump stages is found from detailed calculations of the required total dynamic head (TDH), i.e. the head required to <b>lift</b> <b>well</b> fluids to the surface at the desired pumping rate. Thus, the head versus capacity performance curve of the selected pump can easily be plotted based {{on the performance of}} a single stage.|$|E

40|$|Optimization {{problem for}} oil {{production}} in a multi gas lift wells system is discussed. The {{main problem is}} to identify allocation of gas injection for each well to obtain maximum total oil production. The gas injection rate is constrained by a maximum limit. Oil production rate is a nonlinear function of gas injection rate, which is unknown explicitly. In existing approaches, the nonlinear function is estimated from empirical or numerical simulation data, by curve ¯tting using regression method, or estimated by piecewise linear function. We developed here, a mathematical model for gas <b>lift</b> <b>well</b> system, where the °uid °ow in reservoir and pipes consists of liquid and gas, so the conditions represent two phase °ow phe-nomena.
