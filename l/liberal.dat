5|$|In {{response}} the <b>Liberal</b> Party launched Women's <b>Liberal</b> Associations {{which allowed}} women {{more freedom to}} allocate a role and voice for themselves and were not a mere subsidiary of the national party. The organisation {{of women in the}} <b>Liberal</b> Party in Wales began around 1890 supported by prominent members Gwyneth Vaughan, Nora Phillips and Sybil Thomas. In 1891 an Aberdare branch of the Women's <b>Liberal</b> Foundation was founded and it quickly began advocating votes for women and began leafleting in both English and Welsh. By 1893 there were said to be 7,000 members of the Welsh Union of Women's <b>Liberal</b> Associations which had raised to 9,000 by 1895. At a meeting of the North Wales <b>Liberal</b> Foundation in 1895 it was decided that Women's <b>Liberal</b> Federation would merge with Cymru Fydd, a political pressure group for home rule, to form a new Welsh <b>Liberal</b> Federation and equal rights for women were written into the objects of the organisation. Despite some early successes <b>Liberal</b> organisation floundered as they headed into the new century and apart from the Cardiff branch which achieved some successes, many of the branches had closed by 1907.|$|E

5|$|The Demands of <b>Liberal</b> Education is a 1999 {{political}} philosophy book by Meira Levinson that establishes a <b>liberal</b> political theory of children's education that fits the mutual {{needs of the}} state and its diverse citizenry. She writes that the intent of a <b>liberal</b> education—an education that follows from a <b>liberal</b> society's values—is to maximize the autonomy of individual children through increasing their capacity for liberty. Levinson argues autonomy as a right to children. The book, published by Oxford University Press, aims to address a lacuna between educational policy and <b>liberal</b> political theory.|$|E

In 1932 the <b>Liberal</b> and Country League (LCL) was created, and Playford ran for the multi-member constituency of Murray at the 1933 election.|$|E
