500|$|Mark Deming of AllMusic {{awarded the}} album {{three out of}} five stars, commenting on the band's musical shift; he wrote, [...] "By Shonen Knife's standards, Overdrive does sound <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of hard rock album, and the {{attempts}} to make like Kiss, Thin Lizzy, or Deep Purple come off better than one might expect, though Yamano's guitar skills are less impressive {{than those of the}} average metal axe slinger." [...] Deming complimented the charm of the album, but criticized Yamano's lyrics as [...] "run-of-the-mill", ill-fitting the change in musical direction. The site selected [...] "Black Crow", [...] "Ramen Rock", and [...] "Green Tea" [...] as album highlights. Joe Goggins of Drowned in Sound awarded the album 6 out of 10 stars, and complimented the band for successfully managing to release nineteen studio albums. However, he was slightly critical of the [...] "derivative" [...] nature of the band's sound, as well as their [...] "one-dimensional guitar playing and unrelentingly trivial lyrics".|$|E
500|$|Flea {{was still}} upset over the {{problems}} {{he had with}} John during {{the making of the}} album. Flea felt that John was trying to take over the band and that he could no longer express himself {{in the context of the}} band. Flea decided that he would finish the album but quit prior to their tour. According to Chad Smith, Flea and Frusciante eventually had a sit-down meeting with each other to air out their differences. Frusciante had no idea how Flea was feeling and had no intentions of taking over the band. Flea also credited practicing Vipassanā meditation along with Frusciante for helping the two repair their musical relationship. With their problems worked out, the band launched their promo tour to support the album on New York City's Ellis Island. Sponsored by the rock radio station K-Rock, the event was titled the [...] "Pep Rally". The band performed eight songs from By the Way, as well as tracks from Californication and Blood Sugar Sex Magik in front of 900 contest winners. The New York Post declared the show [...] "one of the top concerts of the year." [...] The location was chosen in order to reinvigorate lower Manhattan after the September 11, 2001 attacks and all proceeds were donated to pertinent charity organizations. Immediately following this, the Chili Peppers embarked on a world tour to support the album. Beginning in Europe, they also played at events such as the Fuji Rock Festival and Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in between. The band eventually culminated their Europe leg of the tour in February 2003, and commenced the United States leg on May 1. The Chili Peppers played at Madison Square Garden in New York City on June 3, 2003 to a sold-out crowd and an enthusiastic response from critics. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times reported that [...] "on Tuesday night, the [...] came to Madison Square Garden for an extraordinary two-hour performance...On 'Don't Forget Me', [...] strummed chords, while Mr. Frusciante contributed a gorgeous guitar line that bubbled and hissed <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of chemical reaction." [...] The US leg ended on June 21; the band took a small hiatus before performing at Slane Castle on August 23, to a crowd of over 80,000. Live at Slane Castle, the result of the concert, would become the Chili Peppers' second live DVD, after Off the Map.|$|E

2500|$|IGN's Chris Roper scored Mob Wars 6.2 out of 10, writing [...] "there are {{a number}} of areas where the ball was dropped." [...] He was mildly {{impressed}} with the card gameplay, but felt it wasn't enough to [...] "help the game rise above mediocrity." [...] He called the game [...] "an interesting idea, but it doesn't feel cohesive enough or like either part was pushed as far as it could go." [...] GameSpot's Greg Mueller scored it 6 out of 10. He too was more impressed with Mob Wars mode than Story Mode, writing [...] "it sounds like the makings of an experiment gone awry, <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of Frankenstein's monster of game design, but it's actually playable--and even fun." [...] However, he called the connection between Story Mode and Mob Wars [...] "tenuous and disjointed." [...] He concluded [...] "Mob Wars doesn't live up to its potential. There are some flashes of a good game in there, and you might have fun for the first couple of hours, but unfortunately that enjoyment is fleeting, and you'll be left feeling aggravated and disappointed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{obstacles}} {{written for}} the pair included the opposition of Colleen's family to the pairing, J.T.'s music career, and third party characters who came between them. In 2003, J.T. cheated on Colleen with Anita Hodges, an older woman considered a [...] "sexy cougar". Luckinbill explained J.T. as being [...] "weak in a desperate moment", and that he [...] "felt really sorry for someone he's known his whole life, and the good side of J.T. emerged to offer Anita some comfort. Then it got really out of hand." [...] He added that J.T. [...] "cares deeply" [...] for Colleen and [...] "realizes she will be devastated by his actions". Luckinbill felt that J.T. [...] "wouldn't hurt her for the world, and yet {{that is exactly what}} he'll end up doing". In May 2004, Fonseca's contract was not renewed and she was confirmed to exit. Within the storyline, Colleen leaves Genoa City and J.T. because she does not want to {{stand in the way of}} his music career. However, she returned to reprise the role briefly that December. [...] J.T. had begun dating Brittany Hodges (Lauren Woodland) and the writers wanted to bring Colleen back to [...] "add more complications to the story". Luckinbill described his character's feelings for Colleen and Brittany as extremely different, saying: [...] "J.T. saw Colleen as somebody so opposite himself that he considered himself undeserving of her love. She was too angelic [...] Brittany has more of the 'black sheep' in her." [...] Fans of the pair campaigned for a reunion between J.T. and Colleen when Fonseca returned, and pushed for her to be put back on contract. Fonseca and Luckinbill also anticipated the repairing of their characters because of a positive viewer response. Fonseca described it as being [...] "the best part of coming back", stating: [...] "Already it seems the fans [...] excited to see us together again." [...] Luckinbill stated: [...] "When they were together, they were <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of supercouple and there is a huge amount of fans who still want them together." [...] News of Fonseca's second exit incited a fan outcry and a campaign pushing for the actress's permanent return. Fonseca made her final appearance as Colleen in February 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Some of {{the drum}} {{programming}} {{employed in the}} original Detroit-based techno made use of syncopation and polyrhythm, yet {{in many cases the}} basic disco-type pattern was used as a foundation, with polyrhythmic elaborations added using other drum machine voices.
