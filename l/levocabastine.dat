OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to compare the protective effect of <b>levocabastine</b> eye drops with that of nedocromil in a conjunctival provocation test with allergen. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with allergic conjunctivitis to grass pollen were recruited. After a preliminary provocation to determine conjunctival reaction threshold (erythema of at least 50 % of the conjunctiva with ocular itching), patients were randomized to receive either topical <b>levocabastine</b> (0. 05 %) or nedocromil (2 %) 15 minutes before provocation.

Objective: We sought to compare the efficacy and mechanisms of action of nedocromil sodium and <b>levocabastine</b> in reducing conjunctival symptoms after ocular allergen challenge. Methods: We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 48 subjects were randomized to 3 groups to receive nedocromil sodium (2 %), <b>levocabastine</b> (0. 05 %), or placebo eye drops twice daily for 2 weeks before ocular challenge with 10 ?L of ryegrass extract. Symptoms and tear histamine and PGD 2 concentrations were determined before challenge and at 10, 20, 30, 60, 180, and 360 minutes after challenge. Bulbar biopsy specimens were taken at 6 and 24 hours after challenge to assess conjunctival inflammatory cell numbers, adhesion molecule expression, and mast cellâ€“associated IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 6, IL- 13, and TNF-? levels. Results: Both drugs significantly reduced total symptom scores (P <. 05) at all times after challenge compared with placebo. Itching, hyperemia, and lacrimation were most affected. Nedocromil sodium treatment reduced tear concentrations of histamine (by 77 %) and PGD 2 (by 70 %) at 30 minutes after challenge (both P <. 05).

Reduction of eosinophil leucocytes and tear lymphocytes was higher not significant in the NAAGA group. The same trend was observed for the evolution of total ocular symptom score. There {{were no significant differences between}} treatment groups in the occurrence of adverse effects, except for burning which was more frequent in the LEVO group (p = 0. 002). CONCLUSION: The anti-eosinophilic actions of NAAGA were shown by a significant reduction of ECP tear concentrations. A decreased lymphocyte count and an overall improvement of the symptomatology were also noted. Moreover, the tolerability of NAAGA appeared to be better...|$|E
40|$|Topical antihistamines in {{seasonal}} {{allergic rhinitis}} - A trial with dimethindenemaleate (DMM) as a nasal spray. This study investigates the efficacy {{and safety of}} dimethindenemaleate (0, 1 %) vs. placebo nasal spray in the therapy of seasonal allergic Rhinitis. 175 patients were randomised in a multicenter placebo-controlled double blind study (phase III) with parallel groups. This thesis investigates especially DMM nasal spray in comparison with other frequently used topical antihistamines: azelastine and <b>levocabastine.</b> The efficacy is measured from the patients rating at baseline (nasal) and {{the mean of the}} third evening and the forth morning. This "effect" was the same in both groups. Evaluating efficacy patients rated "symptom free / good improvement" in 44 % (DMM) and 36 % (Placebo) of the cases. The study doctors rated the efficacy in 46 % (DMM) and 50 % (Placebo) of the cases as "symptom free / good improvement". Tolerability was rated "very good /good" in 90 % (Placebo) and 89 % (DMM) of the cases by the patients. The doctors decided for "very good /good" in 95 % of the cases (both groups). The improvement of symptoms in the first week was 41 % (DMM) and. 39 % (Placebo), after 2 weeks it was 56 % (DMM) and. 59 % (Placebo). Patients vigilance improved for 18 % - therefore there was no sedative adverse effect of DMM. Efficacy measurements in the first week showed inferiority of DMM compared to azelastine and <b>levocabastine.</b> The onset of action of DMM is faster then the other nasal antihistamines analysed. Adverse reactions were more frequent in patients applying <b>levocabastine,</b> then DMM. In this aspect and in vigilance DMM is equal to azelastine. Tolerability is very good in all three groups with minimum of 89 %. Even though it is inferior in efficacy compared to the other antihistamines, one cannot deny its potency and very good tolerability. Remarkable is the efficacy of the by definition non-active placebo. The superiority of the active substance is notable in only few parameters, with the main criterion missing. This fact is mainly due to "bad" weather and an "active" placebo...|$|E

Olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 1 % ophthalmic solution (Patanol&reg;) was introduced to the market in Japan in October 2006. In a conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) test, olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 1 % ophthalmic solution significantly suppressed ocular itching and hyperemia compared with <b>levocabastine</b> hydrochloride 0. 05 % ophthalmic solution, and the number of patients who complained of ocular discomfort was lower in the olopatadine group than in the <b>levocabastine</b> group. Conjunctival cell membrane disruption was observed in vitro in the ketotifen fumarate group, epinastine hydrochloride group, and azelastine hydrochloride group, but not in the olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 1 % ophthalmic solution group, which may potentially explain the lower discomfort felt by patients on instillation. Many other studies in humans have revealed the superiority of olopatadine 0. 1 % hydrochloride eye drops to several other anti-allergic eye drops. Overseas, olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 2 % ophthalmic solution for a once-daily regimen has been marketed under the brand name of Pataday&reg;. It is expected that olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solutions may be used in patients with a more severe spectrum of allergic conjunctival diseases, such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis or atopic keratoconjunctivitis, in the near future.

40|$|AbstractA {{search for}} {{sequences}} homologous to the neurotensin receptor cDNA in a rat hypothalamic library has identified a novel neurotensin receptor (NTR- 2). The 1539 bp cDNA encodes a 416 amino acid protein and shows highest homology to the previously cloned neurotensin receptor (NTR- 1) (64 % homology and 43 % identity). Binding and pharmacological studies demonstrate that NTR- 2 expressed in COS cells recognizes neurotensin (NT) with high affinity {{as well as}} several other agonists and antagonists. However, a fundamental difference was found; unlike NTR- 1, NTR- 2 recognizes, with high affinity, <b>levocabastine,</b> a histamine H 1 receptor antagonist previously shown to compete with NT for low-affinity binding sites in brain...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} the cloning and {{expression of the}} levocabastine-sensitive neurotensin (NT) receptor from mouse brain. The receptor protein comprises 417 amino acids and bears the characteristics of G-protein-coupled receptors. This new NT receptor (NTR) type is 39 % homologous to, but pharmacologically distinct from, the only other NTR cloned to date from the rat brain and the human HT 29 cell line. When the receptor is expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, the H 1 antihistaminic drug <b>levocabastine,</b> like NT and neuromedin N, triggers an inward current. The pharmacological properties of this receptor correspond {{to those of the}} low-affinity, levocabastinesensitive NT binding site described initially in membranes prepared from rat and mouse brain.

40|$|The {{role and}} {{signaling}} {{properties of the}} low-affinity neurotensin receptor (NTS 2) are still controversial. In particular, {{it is unclear whether}} neurotensin acts as an agonist, inverse agonist, or antag-onist at this site. In view of the growing evidence for a role of NTS 2 in antinociception, the elucidation of the pharmacological and coupling properties of this receptor is particularly critical. In the present study, we demonstrate that in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the rat NTS 2 receptor, neurotensin (NT), <b>levocabastine,</b> neuromedin N, and the high-affinity NT receptor antagonist SR 48692 [2 -{[1 -(- 7 -chloroquinolin- 4 -yl) - 5 -(2, 6 -dimethoxyphenyl) - 1 H-pyrazole- 3 -carbonyl]amino}adamantane- 2 -carboxylic acid] all bind to and activate the NTS 2 receptor. This activation is followed by ligand-induced internalization of recep-tor-ligand complexes, as evidenced by confocal microscopy us...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that concentrations of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) {{may be related}} to the extent of cytokine-mediated airway inflammation. Recent findings indicate the nasal airways as an important site of NO production. Our objective was to evaluate whether children with allergic rhinitis show different nasal NO levels when compared with normal healthy subjects and the effect of topical steroids and anti-histamine therapy. We have measured the concentration of NO drawn from the nose of 21 children (5 â€“ 17 years old) affected by perennial allergic rhinitis (house dust mite) out of therapy for at least 3 weeks. Thirteen children were then treated with nasal beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) (400 Î¼g daily) and eight subjects with nasal anti-histamine <b>levocabastine</b> (200 Î¼g daily). Measurements were performed before and after 10 days of treatment. As a control group we evaluated 21 healthy children aged 5 â€“ 15 years. To measure NO we used a chemiluminescence analyser. Before treatment the whole group of children with allergic rhinitis showed a mean (Â± SEM) nasal NO concentration of 267 Â± 18 ppb, significantly higher (P< 0 Â· 01) than the control group (186 Â± 15 ppb). The group of children treated with BDP showed, after 10 days of therapy, a significant (P< 0 Â· 05) decrease of nasal NO concentration (271 Â± 21 ppb vs. 212 Â± 20 ppb). Indeed, in the group treated with <b>levocabastine,</b> nasal NO concentrations did not present a significant difference (P not significant) compared with baseline (261 Â± 33 ppb and 252 Â± 31 ppb, respectively). These data suggest that (1) children with allergic rhinitis have higher levels of nasal NO than non-atopic controls and (2) intranasal steroid therapy significantly reduces nasal NO production in children with allergic rhinitis. We speculate that the allergic inflammatory response may influence the nasal NO levels and that NO measurements may be a useful marker of nasal inflammation...|$|E
40|$|The rat neurotensin {{receptor}} cDNA sequence was transfected in Chinese hamster ovary {{cells and}} cellular clones which stably express the corresponding protein were isolated and characterized. The Scatchard {{analysis of the}} specific binding of [3 H]neurotensin indicated a Kd value of 0. 45 +/- 0. 08 nM and a Bmax value of 3. 27 +/- 0. 29 pmol/mg of protein. Displacement experiments using peptidic analogs of neurotensin and <b>levocabastine</b> confirmed that the transfected receptor exhibits the binding properties of the neurotensin receptor characterized in the rat brain. Neurotensin stimulated the phosphoinositides hydrolysis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and this effect was mimicked by neurotensin(8 - 13) and by neuromedin N. The stimulation of phosphoinositides hydrolysis was not inhibited by pertussis toxin. These {{results indicate that the}} transfected cells actively express the rat neurotensin receptor which is functionally coupled to phospholipase C through a pertussis toxin-insensitive GTP-binding protein, and that neuromedin N is able to induce the phosphoinositides turnover by interaction with the neurotensin receptor...|$|E
40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Compounds {{active at}} neurotensin receptors (NTS 1 and NTS 2) exert anal-gesic effects on {{different}} types of nociceptive modalities, including thermal, mechanical, and chemical stimuli. The NTS 2 preferring peptide JMV- 431 (2) and the NTS 2 selective non-peptide compound <b>levocabastine</b> (6) {{have been shown to}} be effective in relieving the pain associated with peripheral neuropathies. With the aim of identifying novel nonpeptide com-pounds selective for NTS 2, we examined analogues of SR 48692 (5 a) using a FLIPR calcium assay in CHO cells stably expressing rat NTS 2. This led to the discovery of the NTS 2 selective nonpeptide compound 1 -({[1 -(4 -fluorophenyl) - 5 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) - 1 H-pyrazol- 3 -yl]-carbonyl}amino) cyclohexane carboxylic acid (NTRC- 739, 7 b) starting from the nonselective compound 5 a.
