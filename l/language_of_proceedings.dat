40|$|The {{number of}} {{cross-border}} consumer transactions in the EU {{is growing at}} a rapid pace: the number of EU consumers entering into such transactions doubled over the decade 2002 - 12. Particularly significant growth is visible with regard to online cross-border transactions, {{with the number of}} EU consumers engaging in these having grown six times in the same period. However, the individual value of such transactions remains relatively small, with almost half of them falling below the threshold of € 100. Just {{as in the case of}} domestic transactions, cross-border bargains too do not always end with the outcome desired by both parties, with a dispute the result. If these cannot be resolved amicably, the creditor has the choice either to pursue the case in court, or to give up the claim. However, the costs and burdens of ordinary civil procedures often act as a deterrent to pursuing claims. Therefore, most EU Member States have introduced some form of simplified track for small claims. These procedures, often successful with regard to domestic litigation, are not, as a rule, well adapted for crossborder disputes. With the aim of overcoming this gap, the EU legislature adopted a European Small Claims Procedure (ESCP) in 2007. The ESCP is a simplified and accelerated civil procedure, available only in cross-border cases, for claims up to € 2 000. It is an optional procedure, in that it does not replace similar national procedures. Whereas the Regulation covers several aspects of the procedure, in particular the standard forms to be used by parties, deadlines imposed upon the court and parties, rules on the written phase of proceedings, as well as minimum standards for review of the judgment, many other key aspects have been left to national law. This applies in particular to the jurisdiction of courts, court fees, detailed rules of evidence law, rules on appeals and finally details of the enforcement procedure. Despite its potential to facilitate cross-border enforcement of small debts in the EU, the Regulation has not been a major success in practice. The limited statistical data available indicates that very few cases are being filed, with an average of approximately 100 per Member State each year. Various reasons for this have been identified, in particular lack of knowledge about the procedure among citizens and judges, the high costs of translation, the absence of clear rules on the service of judgments, and the fact that rules on enforcement proceedings have not been unified, but are left to the Member States. In 2013, the Commission put forward a proposal for amending the ESCP Regulation with a view to increasing its attractiveness. Four key issues have been addressed. Firstly, the threshold of a 'small' claim would be raised from € 2 000 to € 10 000. Secondly, expanding the notion of a 'cross-border' claim would be considerably liberalised. Thirdly, there would be a maximum cap on court fees set at 10 % of the value of the claim. Finally, the use of means of distant communication would become obligatory when parties are domiciled in different Member States. Nevertheless, a number of key aspects of the ESCP would continue to be regulated by domestic civil procedure, in particular the jurisdiction of courts within a Member State, the <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings,</b> admissibility and forms of appeal, rules on evidence and on computation of time, and rules concerning enforcement proceedings...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the translation of legal texts in criminal proceedings as a human right.

The latter has been defined by EP rapporteur Ludford as the first EU fair trial law whereby translation becomes a tool for the inclusion of those who do not speak or understand the <b>language</b> <b>of</b> the <b>proceedings.</b> After an analysis of the Directive in the first part, this paper will tackle its implementation in the member states, which have taken advantage of its vagueness, hardly changing current practices. Finally, a training format developed within the EU project QUALETRA will be presented in the third part of the paper to address the quality requirements set out in the Directive...|$|R
50|$|In prehistoric Britain, {{traditional}} {{common law}} was {{discussed in the}} vernacular (see Celtic law). The legal language and legal tradition changed with waves of conquerors over the following centuries. Roman Britain (after the conquest beginning in AD 43) followed Roman legal tradition, and its legal language was Latin. Following the Roman departure from Britain circa 410 and the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain, the dominant tradition was instead Anglo-Saxon law, which was discussed in the Germanic vernacular (Anglo-Saxon, Old English), and written in Old English since circa 600, beginning with the Law of Æthelberht. Following the Norman invasion of England in 1066, Anglo-Norman French became the official <b>language</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>proceedings</b> in England {{for a period of}} nearly 300 years until the Pleading in English Act 1362 (and continued in minor use for another 300 years), while Medieval Latin was used for written records for over 650 years. Some English technical terms were retained, however (see Anglo-Saxon law: Language and dialect for details).|$|R
50|$|Modern German {{begins with}} the Early New High German (ENHG) period, which the {{influential}} German philologist Wilhelm Scherer dates 1350-1650, terminating {{with the end of}} the Thirty Years' War. This period saw the further displacement of Latin by German as the primary <b>language</b> <b>of</b> courtly <b>proceedings</b> and, increasingly, <b>of</b> literature in the German states. While these states were still under the control of the Holy Roman Empire and far from any form of unification, the desire for a cohesive written language that would be understandable across the many German-speaking principalities and kingdoms was stronger than ever. As a spoken language German remained highly fractured through this period with a vast number of often mutually-incomprehensible regional dialects being spoken throughout the German states; the invention of the printing press c.1440 and the publication of Luther's vernacular translation of the Bible in 1534, however, had an immense effect on standardizing German as a supra-dialectal written language.|$|R

In November 2010, after reviewing the complaints, the VADOC became the first corrections department in the country to install videophones, allowing deaf and hard of hearing inmates to communicate with friends and family outside the facility. In addition, sign <b>language</b> versions <b>of</b> rules, <b>proceedings,</b> medical appointments, meals, and events were also made available, and interpreters were brought in twice a week.|$|R
50|$|While {{there is}} no {{complete}} agreement over the dates of the Middle High German (MHG) period, it is generally seen as lasting from 1050 to 1350. This period is characterized primarily by a significant expansion of the geographical territory occupied by Germanic tribes, and consequently {{of the number of}} German speakers. Whereas during the Old High German period the Germanic tribes extended only as far east as the Elbe and Saale rivers, the MHG period saw a number of these tribes expanding beyond this eastern boundary into Slavic territory (this is known as the Ostsiedlung). Along with the increasing wealth and geographic influence of the Germanic groups came greater use of German in the courts of nobles as the standard <b>language</b> <b>of</b> official <b>proceedings</b> and literature. A clear example of this is the mittelhochdeutsche Dichtersprache employed in the Hohenstaufen court in Swabia as a standardized supra-dialectal written language. While these efforts were still regionally bound, German began to be used in place of Latin for certain official purposes leading to a greater need for regularity in written conventions.|$|R
