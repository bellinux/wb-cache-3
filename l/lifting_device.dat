25|$|Open circuit scuba has no {{provision}} for using the breathing gas more than once for respiration. The gas inhaled from the scuba equipment is exhaled to the environment, or occasionally into another item of equipment for a special purpose, usually to increase buoyancy of a <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> such as a buoyancy compensator, inflatable surface marker buoy or small lifting bag. The breathing gas is generally provided from a high-pressure diving cylinder through a scuba regulator. By always providing the appropriate breathing gas at ambient pressure, demand valve regulators ensure the diver can inhale and exhale naturally and without excessive effort, regardless of depth, as and when needed.|$|E

40|$|Home support workers (HSWs) work in clients 2 ̆ 7 homes {{assisting}} with {{rehabilitation and}} activities of daily living. Like all health-care professionals, HSWs are at an increased risk for developing back injuries. <b>Lift</b> <b>devices</b> {{have been shown to}} reduce injuries to the worker. Presently, there are few <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> for home use that cost under 4000 CDN. Our study involved designing a safe and affordable <b>lift</b> <b>device</b> (retail cost under 2000 CDN) to be used by HSWs in the home and evaluating it in a typical bathroom. Thirty-eight HSWs and three seniors evaluated the BCIT lift, a commercially available lift (BHM Medical Inc.) and the manual method of transfer and lift. Results indicated that the BCIT lift was an improvement over the manual method of transferring, and approximated the more expensive, automatic lift in terms of perceived exertion, ease of use and safety.

Also, it provides a review of example research in these areas including advancements in intelligent wheelchair designs and capabilities. We have focused on <b>lift</b> <b>devices,</b> wheelchairs, the combination of wheelchairs and <b>lift</b> <b>devices,</b> rehabilitation and standards. What appears to be lacking, as determined by our research for this survey, are the following points regarding wheelchair dependents: • There is limited research and development in the area of advanced patient <b>lift</b> <b>devices,</b> beyond standers, that are combined with wheelchairs to allow lift above approximately 5. 5 cm (14 in) to reach upper shelves and even upper floors, • There is limited research and development in the area of patient <b>lift</b> <b>devices</b> combine...|$|R

40|$|Among nurses, {{low back}} pain is a common {{musculoskeletal}} disorder. A significant proportion of back pain episodes {{can be attributed to}} events that occur during patient handling activities when nurses are exposed to heavy lifting, awkward back postures, and pushing and/or pulling. In the past years, many ergonomic interventions have been developed, like <b>lifting</b> <b>devices,</b> to reduce mechanical load related to patient handling activities in order to (partly) decrease the occurrence of {{low back pain}}. The efficacy of <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> designed to reduce mechanical load has been demonstrated in several laboratory studies. However, the timely and integrated implementation at the workplace remains difficult. Various intervention studies have indicated that individual behaviour of nurses is a key factor in successful implementation of <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> in healthcare. As examples, Evanoff et al. (2003) and Li et al. (2004) identified the lack of perceived need to use lifts as an important barrier in the effectiveness of <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> at the workplace. Nelson et al. (2006) showed that acceptance of patient handling equipment by the staff was a crucial facilitator in the implementation process of a multiple intervention aimed at patient handling in healthcare. A previous study in hospitals and nursing homes showed that individual behaviour of nurses, i. e. nurses’ motivation to use <b>lifting</b> <b>devices,</b> was strongly associated with <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> use. This study also pointed at the influence of organisationallevel measures on nurses’ behaviour, comprising both factors in each ward {{as well as at the}} managerial level of the healthcare institute. Thus, the appropriate implementation of ergonomic devices requires a careful process whereby individual behaviour is supported by organisational measures in order to enable and support the individual to adopt the required behaviour to prevent musculoskeletal complaints. A recent systematic review corroborated that upstream organisational strategies had a profound impact on musculoskeletal health...|$|R
