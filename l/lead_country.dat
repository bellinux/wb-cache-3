40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{evidence}} on the "global smaller firm" that actively seeks and achieves market presence in the <b>lead</b> international <b>countries</b> of its industry. This firm is distinct from the international new venture (or "born global smaller firm"). We expect the global smaller firm to be distinguished by a stronger entrepreneurial orientation compared with the "intercontinental SME" that has not actively pursued presence in the <b>lead</b> <b>countries</b> of its industry. Evidence drawn from 10 in-depth case studies of the Greek gold and silversmith sector confirms our expectation, particularly in relation to proactiveness towards international opportunities, risk attitude and innovativeness. Specifically, proactiveness towards opportunities draws from active interaction with customers and partners in the <b>lead</b> <b>countries.</b> This is a significant finding since it shows {{that there is a}} distinguishable body of SMEs, apart from international new ventures, which can be characterised as international entrepreneurial. Therefore, the incorporation of the energetic international market selection and presence in the <b>lead</b> industry <b>countries</b> dimension (which pertains to global SMEs), along with that of speed to international markets (which pertains to international new ventures), may extend the scope of international entrepreneurship research.
