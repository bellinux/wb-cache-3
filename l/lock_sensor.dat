40|$|Laser {{frequency}} stabilization {{is a critical}} part of the interferometry measurement system of space-based gravitational wave observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Arm locking as a proposed {{frequency stabilization}} technique, transfers the stability of the long arm lengths to the laser frequency. The arm <b>locking</b> <b>sensor</b> synthesizes an adequately filtered linear combination of the inter-spacecraft phase measurements to estimate the laser frequency noise, which can be used to control the laser frequency. At the University of Florida we developed the hardware-based University of Florida LISA Interferometer Simulator (UFLIS) to study and verify laser frequency noise reduction and suppression techniques under realistic LISA-like conditions. These conditions include the variable Doppler shifts between the spacecraft, LISA-like signal travel times, optical transponders, realistic laser frequency and timing noise. We review the different types of arm <b>locking</b> <b>sensors</b> and discuss their expected performance in LISA. The presented results are supported by results obtained during experimental studies of arm locking under relevant LISA-like conditions. We measured the noise suppression as well as initial transients and frequency pulling in the presence of Doppler frequency errors. This work has demonstrated the validity and feasibility of arm locking in LISA. Comment: 18 page...|$|R

40|$|For {{the laser}} {{interferometer}} space antenna (LISA) to reach it's design sensitivity, the coupling {{of the free}} running laser frequency noise to the signal readout must be reduced by more than 14 orders of magnitude. One technique employed to reduce the laser frequency noise will be arm locking, where the laser frequency is locked to the LISA arm length. This paper details an implementation of arm locking, studies orbital effects, the impact of errors in the Doppler knowledge, and noise limits. The noise performance of arm locking is calculated with {{the inclusion of the}} dominant expected noise sources: ultra stable oscillator (clock) noise, spacecraft motion, and shot noise. Studying these issues reveals that although dual arm locking [A. Sutton & D. A Shaddock, Phys. Rev. D 78, 082001 (2008). ] has advantages over single (or common) arm locking in terms of allowing high gain, it has disadvantages in both laser frequency pulling and noise performance. We address this by proposing a hybrid sensor, retaining the benefits of common and dual arm <b>locking</b> <b>sensors.</b> We present a detailed design of an arm locking controller and perform an analysis of the expected performance when used with and without laser pre-stabilization. We observe that the sensor phase changes beneficially near unity-gain frequencies of the arm-locking controller, allowing a factor of 10 more gain than previously believed, without degrading stability. We show that the LISA frequency noise goal can be realized with arm locking and Time-Delay Interferometry only, without any form of pre-stabilization. Comment: 28 pages, 36 figure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{encompasses}} {{a study on}} the development of a walking gait for fault tolerant locomotion in unstructured environments. The fault tolerant gait for adaptive locomotion fulfills stability conditions in opposition to a fault (<b>locked</b> joints or <b>sensor</b> failure) event preventing a robot to realize stable locomotion over uneven terrains. To accomplish this feat, a fault tolerant gait based on force‐position control is proposed in this paper for a hexapod robot to enable stable walking with a joint failure. Furthermore, we extend our proposed fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) method to deal with the critical failure of the angular rate sensors responsible for the attitude control of the robot over uneven terrains. A performance analysis of straight‐ line walking is carried out which shows that the proposed FDD‐based gait is capable of generating an adaptive walking pattern during joint or sensor failures.

5000|$|The F-35's radar-absorbent {{materials}} {{are designed to}} be more durable and less maintenance-intensive than those of its predecessors. At optimal frequencies, the F-35 compares favorably to the F-22 in stealth, according to General Mike Hostage, Commander of the Air Combat Command. Like other stealth fighters, however, the F-35 is more susceptible to detection by low-frequency radars because of the Rayleigh scattering resulting from the aircraft's physical size. However, such radars are also conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and have low precision. Although fighter-sized stealth aircraft could be detected by low-frequency radar, missile <b>lock</b> and targeting <b>sensors</b> primarily operate in the X-band, which F-35 RCS reduction is made for, so they cannot engage unless at close range. Because the aircraft's shape is important to the RCS, special care must be taken to match the [...] "boilerplate" [...] during production. Ground crews require Repair Verification Radar (RVR) test sets to verify the RCS after performing repairs, which is not a concern for non-stealth aircraft.|$|R

We aimed at characterizing phase locking between SI and SII {{in response to}} electric stimuli applied once every 3 s to the right median nerve at the wrist; phase locking between brain regions has been proposed to either reflect joined processing or information exchange. Ongoing neuromagnetic activity of healthy volunteers was recorded with 204 planar gradiometers covering the whole scalp. After selecting a sensor maximally sensitive to activity in the left (contralateral) SI, phase <b>locking</b> between this <b>sensor</b> and the other 203 sensors was examined from single trial data. Statistically significant phase locking was found at ≈ 20 Hz, 80 – 90 ms after the stimuli between the left SI and the right SII in 9 of 10 subjects. Sensors with high phase-locking values over the left SI and right SII were separated by sensors with no phase-locked activity over the scalp midline, indicating that the phase locking was not caused by the sensors seeing activity from the same sources. The observed SI–SII phase locking would not {{be reflected in the}} evoked responses because a considerable part of it was not time-locked to the stimuli.

40|$|Initial H-mode {{operation}} of the Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) is expanded to higher normalized beta and lower plasma internal inductance moving towards design target operation. As a key supporting device for ITER, an important goal for KSTAR is to produce physics understanding of MHD instabilities at long pulse with steady-state profiles, at high normalized beta, and {{over a wide range}} of plasma rotation profiles. An advance from initial plasma operation is a significant increase in plasma stored energy and normalized beta, with W-tot = 340 kJ, beta(N) = 1. 9, which is 75 % of the level required to reach the computed ideal n = 1 no-wall stability limit. The internal inductance was lowered to 0. 9 at sustained H-mode duration up to 5 s. In ohmically heated plasmas, the plasma current reached 1 MA with prolonged pulse length up to 12 s. Rotating MHD modes are observed in the device with perturbations having tearing rather than ideal parity. Modes with m/n = 3 / 2 are triggered during the H-mode phase but are relatively weak and do not substantially reduce W-tot. In contrast, 2 / 1 modes to date only appear when the plasma rotation profiles are lowered after H-L back-transition. Subsequent 2 / 1 mode locking creates a repetitive collapse of beta(N) by more than 50 %. Onset behaviour suggests the 3 / 2 mode is close to being neoclassically unstable. A correlation between the 2 / 1 mode amplitude and local rotation shear from an x-ray imaging crystal spectrometer suggests that the rotation shear at the mode rational surface is stabilizing. As a method to access the ITER-relevant low plasma rotation regime, plasma rotation alteration by n = 1, 2 applied fields and associated neoclassical toroidal viscosity (NTV) induced torque is presently investigated. The net rotation profile change measured by a charge exchange recombination diagnostic with proper compensation of plasma boundary movement shows initial evidence of non-resonant rotation damping by the n = 1, 2 applied field configurations. The result addresses perspective on access to low rotation regimes for MHD instability studies applicable to ITER.
