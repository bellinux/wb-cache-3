A final capping layer was added to prevent leakage; a <b>landfill</b> gas control system was used to deploy methane from the decomposed rubbish as fuel, and a leachate management system was built to collect leachate for further processing.

5|$|Early garbage {{collection}} in Scarborough {{was performed by}} individual communities and dumped in local landfills which were located in nearby ravines. In 1967 waste collection was reorganized. Local landfills were closed {{and most of the}} garbage was directed to a new <b>landfill</b> on Beare Road in eastern Scarborough. This dump was eventually closed in 1981. A waste transfer site was constructed near Markham Road and Sheppard Avenue East. From there garbage was trucked to the Keele Valley dump in Vaughan and the Brock Road dump in Pickering. In 2002 the Keele Valley <b>landfill</b> was closed. As part of Toronto's overall waste management, garbage was then trucked to Michigan. This arrangement lasted until 2010 when garbage was sent to the new Green Lane <b>landfill</b> site in Elgin County.|$|E
5|$|Food {{waste is}} {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in food waste is considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European <b>Landfill</b> Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to <b>landfill</b> and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in <b>landfill,</b> food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The food supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping food waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E

These <b>landfills</b> are not only holding the trash of the citizens of Pennsylvania, but they also hold the trash of other states. Pennsylvania {{is one of the main}} states that imports waste. Much of Pennsylvania's waste comes from neighboring states such as New Jersey and New York. In fact, Pennsylvania has more trash per person at 34.5 tons of trash per person than every other sate except Nevada in 2016. However, this process of importing waste is very lucrative for the Pennsylvania counties by providing labor market opportunities and helps increase the municipality's budgets by fees paid by these exporting states. For example, Throop, Pennsylvania $6 million budget is made up of $4 million from the host feels paid from importing other state's waste.|$|R

5|$|After World War II, {{residential}} development continued {{to expand in}} the watershed of Darby Creek. The automobile replaced railroads as the dominant form of transportation, and it allowed workers to live farther from their places of employment. As a result, the population of Springfield Township more than doubled between 1950 and 1960. The Tinicum Wildlife Preserve was established in 1955 after the Gulf Oil Corporation donated a diked impoundment on the creek to the City of Philadelphia. Local resident Jean Diehl started a grassroots campaign to preserve the marsh in 1969, and Two Studies of Tinicum Marsh was published the following year which demonstrated the ecological importance of the marsh. The Folcroft <b>Landfill</b> and the Clearview <b>Landfill</b> operated along the creek between the 1950s and the 1970s before closing in the mid 1970s. The former is {{on the west bank}} of the creek and the latter is on the east bank. They supposedly accepted municipal waste, demolition waste, and medical waste.

In 2007, 63,000 tonnes of ash from the station, along with 100,000 tonnes of ash from the Ash Lagoons, was taken and recycled.

40|$|The methane (CH 4) {{emissions}} from {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) <b>landfills</b> in China in 2007 were estimated based on database of the three-dimensional emission factors matrix and point sources, by an IPCC recommended FOD (firstorder decay) model. The location, capacity and age of <b>landfills</b> constitute the three dimensions of the emission factors matrix, which were obtained by laboratory analysis and in situ investigation. Key parameters such as waste composition, degradable organic carbon ratio, CH 4 correction factor, oxidation factor and recovery rate, were carefully analyzed in terms of these three dimensions. The point sources database consists of 2, 107 MSW <b>landfills</b> in cities and towns of China in 2007. The {{results show that the}} CH 4 {{emissions from}} MSW <b>landfills</b> were 1. 186 Mt in 2007. Compared with the CH 4 emissions of 2. 20 Mt in 2005, the significant discrepancy mainly comes from statistical data of <b>landfills,</b> e. g., number of <b>landfills</b> and amount of waste disposed in <b>landfills.</b> CH 4 emissions were lower than 700 t for most of the <b>landfills,</b> whereas there were 279 <b>landfills</b> with emissions larger than 1, 000 t, and only 10 <b>landfills</b> with emissions larger than 10, 000 t. Jiangsu province ranks the largest emitter with 98, 700 t while Tibet is the smallest emitter with 2, 100 t.
