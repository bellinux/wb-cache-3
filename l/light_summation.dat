40|$|Many nocturnal insects {{depend on}} vision for {{daily life and}} have evolved {{different}} strategies to improve their visual capabilities in dim <b>light.</b> Neural <b>summation</b> of visual signals is one strategy to improve visual performance, and {{this is likely to}} be especially important for insects with apposition compound eyes. Here we develop a model to determine the optimum spatiotemporal sampling of natural scenes at gradually decreasing light levels. Image anisotropy has a strong influence on the receptive field properties predicted to be optimal at low <b>light</b> intensities. Spatial <b>summation</b> between visual channels is predicted to extend more strongly in the direction with higher correlations between the input signals. Increased spatiotemporal summation increases signal-to-noise ratio at low frequencies but sacrifices signal-to-noise ratio at higher frequencies. These results, while obtained from a model of the insect visual system, are likely to apply to visual systems in general...|$|R
40|$|In Experiments I and II, rats {{were trained}} to respond on one lever during light and another during tone. The absence of tone and light {{controlled}} response cessation. In the multiple schedule of Experiment I, all reinforcements were received for responding in tone or light; in the chain schedule of Experiment II, all reinforcements were received in no tone + no light for not responding. Experiment I subjects, for which tone and light were associated with response and reinforcement increase, responded significantly more to tone-plus-light than to tone or <b>light</b> alone (additive <b>summation).</b> Experiment II subjects, for which tone and light were associated with response increase and reinforcement decrease, responded comparably to tone, light, and tone + <b>light.</b> Thus, additive <b>summation</b> was observed when stimulus-response and stimulus-reinforcer associations in tone and light were both positive, but not when they were conflicting. All subjects in both experiments responded predominantly on the light-correlated lever during tone + light, even when light intensity was reduced in testing. Furthermore, when a light was presented to a subject engaged in tone-associated responding, all subjects immediately switched the locus of responding to the light-correlated lever. No change in locus occurred when a tone was presented to a subject engaged in light-associated responding, irrespective of the stimulus-reinforcer association conditioned to tone. The light-lever preference in tone + light indicates that the heightened responding observed in Experiment I was not the summation of tone-associated behavior with light-associated behavior. Rather, {{it appears to be}} the result of a facilitation of one operant (light-associated responding) by the reinforcement-associated cue for the other...|$|R
40|$|In Experiment 1, rats' {{responses}} were reinforced on a fixed-interval 30 -sec schedule {{in the presence}} of either a light or a tone and were not reinforced in their absence. Each stimulus was correlated with its own response lever, with only one lever present during a session. When light and tone were compounded {{in the presence of}} the tone-correlated lever, no change in responding occurred. However, when tone was compounded with light {{in the presence of the}} light-correlated lever, level of responding was greater than to <b>light</b> alone (response <b>summation).</b> Summation was also found when each stimulus was correlated with the same lever. Next, light and tone were again correlated with separate levers, but both levers were always simultaneously present. Compounding produced both summation and emission of most responses on the light-correlated lever. This prepotency of light was reduced (1) by leaving a houselight on throughout the session; and (2) by correlating each stimulus with a different schedule (either fixed-interval 4. 7 -sec or fixed-interval 30 -sec). With a medium- and high-intensity houselight and with the different reinforcement schedules, similar results were obtained during compounding, regardless of whether compounding occurred in the presence of the light- or tone-correlated lever...|$|R
40|$|Most of the world's {{animals are}} active in dim light and depend on good vision for the tasks of daily life. Many have evolved visual adaptations that permit a {{performance}} superior to that of manmade imaging devices [1]. In insects, a major model visual system, nocturnal species show impressive visual abilities ranging from flight control [2, 3], to color discrimination [4, 5], to navigation using visual landmarks [6 - 8] or dim celestial compass cues [9, 10]. In addition to optical adaptations that improve their sensitivity in dim <b>light</b> [11], neural <b>summation</b> of <b>light</b> in space and time-which enhances the coarser and slower features of {{the scene at the}} expense of noisier finer and faster features-has been suggested to improve sensitivity in theoretical [12 - 14], anatomical [15 - 17], and behavioral [18 - 20] studies. How these summation strategies function neurally is, however, presently unknown. Here, we quantified spatial and temporal summation in the motion vision pathway of a nocturnal hawkmoth. We show that spatial and temporal summation combine supralinearly to substantially increase contrast sensitivity and visual information rate over four decades of light intensity, enabling hawkmoths to see at light levels 100 times dimmer than without summation. Our results reveal how visual motion is calculated neurally in dim light and how spatial and temporal summation improve sensitivity while simultaneously maximizing spatial and temporal resolution, thus extending models of insect motion vision derived predominantly from diurnal flies. Moreover, the summation strategies we have revealed may benefit manmade vision systems optimized for variable light levels [21]. Anna Lisa Stöckl, David Charles O’Carroll, Eric James Warran...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Light-evoked current {{fluctuations}} {{have been}} recorded from ventral photoreceptors of Limulus for light intensity from threshold up to 105 times threshold. These data are analyzed {{in terms of the}} adapting bump noise model, which postulates that (a) the response to <b>light</b> is a <b>summation</b> of bumps; and (b) the average size of bump decreases with light intensity, and this is the major mechanism of light adaptation. It is shown here that this model can account for the data well. Furthermore, the model provides a convenient framework to characterize, in terms of bump parameters, the effects of calcium ions, which are known to affect photoreceptor functions. From responses to very dim light, it is found that the average impulse response (average {{of a large number of}} responses to dim flashes) can be predicted from knowledge of both the noise characteristics under steady light and the dispersion of latencies of individual bumps. Over the range of light intensities studied, it is shown that (a) the bump rate increases in strict proportionality to light intensity, up to- 105 bumps per second; and (b) the bump height decreases approximately as the- 0. 7 power of light intensity; at rates> 10 ~ bumps per second, the conductance change associated with the single bump seems to reach a minimum value of ^- 10 -t 1 reciprocal ohms; (c) from the lowest to the highest light intensity, the bump duration decreases approximately by a factor of 2, and the time scale of the dispersion of latencies of individual bumps decreases approximately by a factor of 3; (d) removal of calcium ions from the bath lengthens the latency process and causes an increase in bump height but appears to have no effect on either the bump rate or the bump duration...|$|R
