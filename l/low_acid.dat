25|$|Maurice O'Shea of Mountain View pioneered {{planting}} of Pinot noir {{which he used}} to blend with Shiraz. The Pinot noir grown in the warm Region IV climate of the Hunter exhibits very little varietal similarities with the Pinot noirs of Burgundy and Oregon where it tends to produce a <b>low</b> <b>acid,</b> fruity wine. While an obscure grape mostly associated with the fortified wines of Madeira, Verdelho has developed a niche in the Hunter Valley where its thick skin and high acids tolerate the humidity and heat.|$|E
2500|$|Described by Oz Clarke {{as one of}} the [...] "wine world's enigmas", {{the grapes}} unique profile is {{attributed}} to the harsh climate and humidity of the Hunter which coax this <b>low</b> <b>acid</b> grape to higher acid levels than it achieves in the cooler climate of Bordeaux. Typical harvest figures for Hunter Valley Semillon are between 6.8–7.4 g/l acidity and 2.8-3 pH while in Bordeaux the grape is usually harvested at around 4.8–5.5 g/l and 3.1–3.3 pH.|$|E
2500|$|While commercially {{canned goods}} are {{required}} to undergo a [...] "botulinum cook" [...] in a pressure cooker at [...] for 3 minutes, and thus rarely cause botulism, there have been notable exceptions. Two were the 1978 Alaskan salmon outbreak and the 2007 Castleberry's Food Company outbreak. Foodborne botulism is the rarest form though, accounting for only around 15% of cases (US) and has more frequently been from home-canned foods with <b>low</b> <b>acid</b> content, such as carrot juice, asparagus, green beans, beets, and corn. However, outbreaks of botulism have resulted from more unusual sources. In July 2002, fourteen Alaskans ate muktuk (whale meat) from a beached whale, and eight of them developed symptoms of botulism, two of them requiring mechanical ventilation.|$|E

2500|$|Pedro Ximénez is {{most widely}} grown in Spain {{where there were}} [...] of the grape in {{cultivation}} as of 2008. The vast majority of these plantings {{are found in the}} Spanish wine region of Montilla-Moriles where the grapes are used to make fortified Sherry-style wines labelled as PX. After harvest the Pedro Ximénez grapes are traditionally laid out on mats to further desiccate and dry in the sun (in a style similar to straw wine production). The high sugar and <b>low</b> <b>acid</b> wine made from these pressings may be fortified or not, depending on winemaker style, but will usually be very sweet and have a strong aroma and flavor of raisins. The wine may also be aged in a solera, similar to Sherry, with the age of the solera often stated on the wine label. Additionally, some Pedro Ximénez grapes are used as sweetening agents for other wines made in the Montilla-Moriles region.|$|E
2500|$|The time of {{harvesting}} is {{a crucial}} decision because the grape quickly begins to lose acidity as it ripens. For sparkling wine production, the grapes will be harvested early and slightly unripe to maintain the acid levels. Sparkling Chardonnay based wines tend to exhibit more floral and steely flavors in their youth. As the wine ages, particularly if it spends significant time on lees, the wines will develop [...] "toasty" [...] notes. Chardonnay grapes usually have little trouble developing sugar content, even in cooler climates, which translates into high potential alcohol levels and limits the need for chaptalization. On the flip side, <b>low</b> <b>acid</b> levels can be a concern which make the wine taste [...] "flabby" [...] and dull. Winemakers can counteract this by adding tartaric acid in {{a process known as}} [...] "acidification". In cooler climates, the extract and acidity of Chardonnay is magnified which has the potential of producing very concentrated wines that can develop through bottle aging. Chardonnay can blend well with other grapes and still maintain some of its unique character. The grapes most often blended with Chardonnay include Chenin blanc, Colombard and Sémillon.|$|E

Unusual bile acids: ursodeoxycholic acid, 3 -hydroxy- 7 -keto-cholanic acid, and 3, 12 -dihydroxy- 7 -keto-cholanic acid were also noted in intestinal aspirates of azotaemic patients.

40|$|Production of {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} (ROS) is linked to signalling in both developmental and stress responses. The level of ROS is controlled by both production and removal through various scavengers including ascorbic acid and glutathione. Here, the role of <b>low</b> ascorbic <b>acid</b> or glutathione concentrations was investigated on ozone-induced cell death, defence signalling, and developmental responses. <b>Low</b> ascorbic <b>acid</b> concentrations in vtc 1 activated expression of salicylic acid (SA) -regulated genes, a response found {{to be dependent on}} the redox-regulated transcriptional co-regulator NPR 1. In contrast, low glutathione concentrations in cad 2 or pad 2 reduced expression of SA-regulated genes. Testing different responses to jasmonic acid (JA) revealed the presence of at least two separate JA signalling pathways. Treatment of the vtc 1 mutant with JA led to hyper-induction of MONODEHYDROASCORBATE REDUCTASE 3, indicating that <b>low</b> ascorbic <b>acid</b> concentrations prime the response to JA. Furthermore, NPR 1 was found to be a positive regulator of JA-induced expression of MDHAR 3 and TAT 3. The vtc 1 and npr 1 mutants were sensitive to glucose inhibition of seed germination; an opposite response was found in cad 2 and pad 2. Overall, <b>low</b> ascorbic <b>acid</b> concentrations mostly led to opposite phenotypes to low glutathione concentrations, and both antioxidants interacted with SA and JA signalling pathways...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis are {{to describe the}} problems and procedures followed to contract the crop, segregate the seed and products, and evaluate the oil characteristics of <b>low</b> erucic <b>acid</b> rapeseed. In addition to maintaining seed purity during field production, it was also necessary to develop "in plant" procedures for oil extraction and refining. Special techniques were devised for grading the seed with respect to erucic acid levels and green seed content. Collaborative studies with several domestic oil processors were carried through to final product evaluation but market development work with consumers was not initiated. The adverse nutritional data on high erucic acid oils which {{was presented at the}} International Conference at St. Adele in 1970 indicated the need for an immediate reduction of erucic acid levels in food products. The availability of <b>low</b> erucic <b>acid</b> seed in commercial quantities, and the processing and utilization experiences with the seed and oil, permitted an immediate and complete switch-over to <b>low</b> erucic <b>acid</b> varieties in Canada. This gave Canadian plant breeders a lead time of several years over those in other countries to develop high yielding and more adapted varieties of this new genotype. Canada became the first country to offer <b>low</b> erucic <b>acid</b> seed and oil in world markets. It will take years for other countries to develop and convert to <b>low</b> erucic <b>acid</b> varieties and offer competitive quantities in the world trade. In addition, the Canadian experiment gave other countries confidence that their plant breeders could develop similar varieties and only limited legislative action was instituted against the use of high erucic acid oils until local genotypes with the desired nutritional properties were brought into production...|$|R
