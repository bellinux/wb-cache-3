5|$|As {{with other}} British cities, there was {{immigration}} from various Commonwealth {{countries in the}} post war years, which did <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> racist tension. In 1963, a colour bar operated by Bristol Omnibus Company, which at that time refused to employ Black or Asian bus crews, was successfully challenged in the Bristol Bus Boycott, which was considered to have been instrumental in the eventual passage of the Race Relations Act 1968. In 1980 a police raid on a cafe in St Paul's sparked the St Pauls riot, which highlighted the alienation of the city's ethnic minorities.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, Governor Stanley {{announced}} {{publicly that}} {{the main thrust of}} his legislative proposal would be to withhold funds from any local school district which integrated. In response, Gray called a meeting of the Gray Commission to consider the governor's proposal. Stanley said he would not oppose the Gray Commission's proposal to assign students on the basis of factors other than race (which might <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> integration). Stanley's concession, the Washington Post reported, was made because it was widely assumed that the Gray Commission was assumed to be strongly in favor of the pupil assignment plan and the tuition grant proposal.|$|E
5|$|Half {{the area}} of the salt marshes that formed in the lee of Scolt Head Island has been {{reclaimed}} in the last 300 years, creating ecologically important, but very fragile, grazing marshes. Although Holkham is low-lying and can flood in severe weather conditions, it is protected by the spit that developed at the Holkham Gap in the 1990s and the dunes along the coast, which are increasingly being stabilised by vegetation. The Environment Agency's management plan until 2105 is to rely on the natural protection of the dunes, intervening only if work is necessary to maintain their effectiveness {{in the face of a}} potential sea level rise of 1.1m (3ft) by that date. The shingle that makes up Scolt Head Island is moving westwards and southwards at up to 3.5m (10ft) per year. This may affect the movement of sediment, and <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> erosion of the dunes and beaches at Holkham, but should not destroy their effectiveness as a sea defence unless the island reattaches to the mainland at some date in the distant future.|$|E

5|$|The period did <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> {{reform of}} {{internal}} Society statutes, {{such as in}} 1823 and 1831. The most important change there was the requirement that the Treasurer publish an annual report, along {{with a copy of}} the total income and expenditure of the Society. These were to be sent to Fellows at least 14 days before the general meeting, with the intent being to ensure the election of competent Officers by making it readily apparent what existing Officers were doing. This was accompanied by a full list of Fellows standing for Council positions, where previously the names had only been announced a couple of days before. As with the other reforms, this helped ensure that Fellows had a chance to vet and properly consider candidates. The Society's financial troubles were finally resolved in 1850, when a government grant-in-aid of £1,000 a year was accepted. This was increased to £4,000 in 1876, with the Society officially acting merely as the trustee for these funds, doling them out to individual scientists. This grant has now grown to over £47million, some £37million of which is to support around 370 fellowships and professorships.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{the density}} of cities expedites {{commerce}} and facilitates knowledge spillovers, helping people and firms exchange information and generate new ideas. A thicker labor market allows for better skill matching between firms and individuals. Population density enables also sharing of common infrastructure and production facilities, however in very dense cities, increased crowding and waiting times may <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> negative effects.|$|E
25|$|These storms {{are known}} as Nor'easters and often bring widespread, heavy {{snowfall}} to New England. The uninterrupted flat grasslands of the Great Plains also <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> of the most extreme climate swings in the world. Temperatures can rise or drop rapidly and winds can be extreme, and the flow of heat waves or Arctic air masses often advance uninterrupted through the plains.|$|E
25|$|PSA is {{produced}} in the epithelial cells of the prostate, and can be demonstrated in biopsy samples or other histological specimens using immunohistochemistry. Disruption of this epithelium, for example in inflammation or benign prostatic hyperplasia, may <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> diffusion of the antigen into the tissue around the epithelium, and {{is the cause of}} elevated blood levels of PSA in these conditions.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years, Frem were located on Østerbro in Copenhagen, playing its matches at Blegdamsfælleden, {{alongside}} its main rivals {{in the early}} years; AB and KB. In 1905 Frem moved to its own field at Enghavevej, Vesterbro. Being a field-owning club gave Frem the advantage of entry fees.

25|$|All new Houses {{apart from}} Bodeites are {{named after the}}ir founders (although Robinites was {{originally}} Robinsonites). Bodeites was originally Buissonites, named after the Head of Languages at the time. He ran off with the matron, and so the house was renamed Bodeites after the replacement, Mr Bode. This did <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> confusion {{at the time of}} naming the houses because some housemasters moved to houses named after their colleagues.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{approaches}} to algebraic geometry redefine and effectively extend {{the range of}} basic objects in various levels of generality to schemes, formal schemes, ind-schemes, algebraic spaces, algebraic stacks and so on. The need for this arises already from the useful ideas within theory of varieties, e.g. the formal functions of Zariski can be accommodated by introducing nilpotent elements in structure rings; considering spaces of loops and arcs, constructing quotients by group actions and developing formal grounds for natural intersection theory and deformation theory <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> of the further extensions.|$|E

30|$|We {{also have}} to {{consider}} that shallow breathing not only <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> differences in spatial position between subsequent volumes but it also <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> degree of motion artefacts within axial slices as every volume is acquired over 500  ms exposure time [31]. We did not assess the degree of motion artefacts within a volume but one could assume minor degradation of image quality in particular regarding spatial resolution and spatial accuracy. Whether or not such image degradation impacts on perfusion results remains to be determined, however.|$|R
25|$|There is no agreed {{treatment}} protocol. In most {{reported cases}} of ORS the attempted treatment was antidepressants, followed by antipsychotics and various psychotherapies. Little data are available regarding the efficacy of these treatments in ORS, but some suggest that psychotherapy yields {{the highest rate of}} response to treatment, and that antidepressants are more efficacious than antipsychotics (response rates 78%, 55% and 33% respectively). According to one review, 43% of cases which showed overall improvement required more than one treatment approach, and in only 31% did the first administered treatment <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> improvement.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, winemakers {{found little}} early success with Nebbiolo {{as many of}} the {{earliest}} plantings were in sites {{that turned out to be}} too warm for the grape. Research into cooler climate sites <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> favorable examples coming from the marginal climate of Victoria's King Valley. Further studies have indicated that the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria and the Margaret River area of Western Australia have similar amounts of rainfall, relative humidity and sunshine hours as the Langhe region of Piedmont. Victoria's Bendigo, South Australia's Clare Valley and the Mudgee, New South Wales's are also currently being explored for their potential with Nebbiolo.|$|E
25|$|During August 1951, {{a second}} British-built Canberra (WD940) was flown to the US {{to act as}} a pattern {{aircraft}} for Martin, as well as to perform assorted trials and to support performance validation of airframe changes. On 21 December 1951, one of the British pattern aircraft (WD932) was lost in accident; although this was subsequently discovered to be caused by incorrect fuel scheduling having led to the tail-heavy aircraft exceeding its design limits during a maneuver, the crash jeopardized the entire program and invigorated the anti-Canberra political opposition. The crash did <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> design changes in the face of political pressure, but these were not implemented on the first 75 aircraft to be produced.|$|E
