25|$|The {{accident}} investigation board concluded that the probable cause was the attempted three-engine go-around, when the aircraft was in a full <b>landing</b> <b>configuration,</b> at insufficient airspeed and altitude to maintain control.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{analysis}} of the flight data recorder suggests the aircraft was not experiencing any obvious technical malfunction before the accident. Russia's interstate aviation committee MAK states a preliminary assessment shows both engines were operating {{up to the point}} of impact. The aircraft was in <b>landing</b> <b>configuration,</b> with the undercarriage lowered and the flaps positioned at 30 degrees, and did not suffer fire or other damage while airborne.|$|E
25|$|On November 10, 2013 a Metroliner {{operated}} by Bearskin Airlines under flight number JV311, crashed on final approach to its destination of Red Lake, Ontario, Canada {{en route from}} Sioux Lookout, Ontario. The aircraft experienced a near total failure of the left engine at 500ft AGL which, combined with the aircraft being in the <b>landing</b> <b>configuration,</b> caused a loss of airspeed resulting in an unrecoverable situation. Safety systems {{to assist in the}} handling with one engine out did not activate since the engine did not completely shut down; the scenario gave conflicting information to the pilots who did not have time to identify the nature of the failure. Two crew members and three passengers were killed in the crash. Two passengers sustained injuries but survived.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of Gatton panic (Panicum maximum Jacq) and ameliorative changes was studied in coastal salt affected soils under varying <b>land</b> <b>configurations.</b> The {{results indicated that}} green forage yield was increased 93. 45 and 141. 91 % under broad bed furrow system of <b>land</b> <b>configuration</b> Vs traditional method of flat bed planting during 1992 - 93 and 1993 - 94, respectively. Soil properties like pH, EC (Electrical conductivity), ESP (Exchangeable Sodium Percentage) and bulk density were improved significantly in <b>land</b> <b>configuration</b> treatments as compared to control, whereas fertility status of the soil in respect to organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and potassium were significantly increased. Further, it can be revealed that growing of Gatton panic (Panicum maximum Jacq) with broad bed and furrow system of <b>land</b> <b>configuration</b> was best in respect to pronounced effects on green forage yield as well as drastic improvement in soil properties were registered under the narrowest (S 3 = 2. 4 x 6. 0 m) bed and deepest furrow (D 3 = 60 cm) depth in coastal salt-affected soils...|$|R

500|$|In March 2006, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) {{certified}} {{a modified}} control software enhancement to the Airbus A318 {{designed to allow}} the aircraft to perform steep approaches. The aircraft is the largest commercial aircraft certified by EASA for steep approach operations. The software modifies the control laws of the aircraft when the steep approach function is selected by the crew, by automatically deploying some of the spoiler panels to provide additional drag when the aircraft is in the <b>landing</b> <b>configuration.</b> It also provides alternative aural alerts to the crew and modifies spoiler deployment automatically below [...] on landing. The A318 steep approach procedure allows the aircraft to perform approaches at descent angles of up to 5.5°, {{as opposed to the}} standard 3° for a normal approach.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, the first-generation Harriers entered service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and United States Marine Corps (USMC), but were {{handicapped}} in range and payload. In short takeoff and <b>landing</b> <b>configuration,</b> the AV-8A (American designation for the Harrier) carried {{less than half}} the 4,000lb (1,800kg) payload of the smaller A-4 Skyhawk, over a more limited radius. To address this issue, Hawker Siddeley and McDonnell Douglas began joint development of a more capable version of the Harrier in 1973. Early efforts concentrated on an improved Pegasus engine, designated the Pegasus 15, which was being tested by Bristol Siddeley. Although more powerful, the engine's diameter was too large by [...] to fit into the Harrier easily.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>landing</b> gear <b>configuration</b> on TMGs usually {{incorporates}} two fixed main wheels, {{allowing it}} to be taxied on the ground without a wing walker.

2500|$|Despite being {{designated}} by the US Navy as a [...] "heavy", the A-5 was surprisingly agile for such a large aircraft. Without the drag of bombs or missiles, even escorting fighters found that the clean airframe and powerful engines made the Vigilante very fast at high and low altitudes. However, its high approach speed and high angle of attack in the <b>landing</b> <b>configuration</b> made returning to the aircraft carrier a challenge for inexperienced or unwary pilots.|$|E
2500|$|A {{design feature}} of the MU-2 is its high cruise speed, while having a low landing speed. This is {{accomplished}} by using full-span, double-slotted flaps on {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. These flaps give the MU-2 a wing area comparable to a Beechcraft King Air in <b>landing</b> <b>configuration,</b> while having a wing area comparable to a light jet while in cruise mode. The full-span flaps meant that over-wing spoilers were employed, instead of conventional ailerons.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was {{cleared to land}} by controllers at Tashkent at around 1900 hours local time. [...] The area was in full darkness and the weather had deteriorated significantly, with the airport being shrouded in fog that limited visibility {{on the ground to}} 1300 meters. 12.5 km from the airport, Flight 1154 increased its rate of descent, bringing it below the glideslope. The crew then maintained level flight until they become nearer to the airport. [...] As the plane approached the threshold of the runway, it was still 30 to 40 meters above ground level, when it should have been less than half that height and in <b>landing</b> <b>configuration.</b> [...] When the pilots became aware that they were running out of runway, they increased engine power, {{but it was too late}} for the aircraft to climb and go around. The right wing of the aircraft struck either a radio beacon or a stanchion of approach lights, which tore off the wing, and then hit a concrete wall, losing the left wing. Flight 1154 then flipped over and exploded. Rescue services reached the crash site but found no survivors. Among the dead were senior United Nations official Richard Conroyan Australian/British dual citizen and a Canadian aid worker, country manager for the Christian relief organization, World Concern, Richard Penner.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of a four-engine externally blown flap (EBF) powered-lift transport was conducted in the Langley V/STOL tunnel {{to determine the effect}} of different engine configurations on the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics. The different engine configurations were simulated by five different sets of propulsion simulators on a single aircraft model. Longitudinal aerodynamic data were obtained for each simulator on each flap deflection corresponding to cruise, take-off, and landing at a range of angles of attack and various thrust coefficients. The bypass ratio (BPR) 6. 2 engine simulator provided the best lift and drag characteristics of the five simulators tested in the take-off and <b>landing</b> <b>configurations.</b> The poor performance of the BPR 10. 0 and 3. 2 engine simulators can be attributed to a mismatch of engine-model sizes or poor engine location and orientation. Isolated engine wake surveys indicated that a reasonable assessment of the aerodynamic characteristics of an engine-wing-flap configuration could be made if qualitative information were available which defined the engine wake characteristics. All configurations could be trimmed easily with relatively small horizontal-tail incidence angles; however, the take-off <b>landing</b> <b>configurations</b> required a high-lift tail...|$|R
