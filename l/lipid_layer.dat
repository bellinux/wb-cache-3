25|$|Some {{criticisms of}} the {{membrane}} theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations {{such as the ability}} of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A <b>lipid</b> <b>layer</b> cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties). Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form, and that the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water. They demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and fibrin gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.|$|E

Embryogenesis has also been studied, and the stages of development are easily identifiable with a phase contrast microscope following preparation of an egg mass squash. The egg is formed as one cell, with two-cell, four-cell and eight-cell stages recognisable. Further cell division leads to the tadpole stage, with further elongation resulting {{in the first stage}} juvenile, which is roughly four times as long as the egg.

25|$|Overton (a {{distant cousin}} of Charles Darwin) first {{proposed}} {{the concept of}} a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the lipid membrane was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure <b>lipid</b> <b>layer,</b> but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to anions, Leonor Michaelis concluded that ions are adsorbed to the walls of the pores, changing the permeability of the pores to ions by electrostatic repulsion. Michaelis demonstrated the membrane potential (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane. Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a lipid bilayer membrane covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle & Conway showed that the membrane of resting frog muscle was permeable to both K+ and Cl-, but apparently not to Na+, so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to K+ , H+, and Cl- as well as the impermeability to Na+, Ca+, and Mg++.|$|E

Dimerization through hydrogen bonding between gramicidin monomers in opposing leaflets of the membrane results in the formation of an iontophoretic channel.

Using small-angle x-ray diffraction and model systems composed of phospholipids and gramicidin, the effects produced by gramicidin on <b>lipid</b> <b>layers</b> were measured. These measurements explore how peptides are able to modulate the spontaneous curvature properties of phospholipid assemblies.

Similarly, we investigate the dynamics of objects embedded in a simpler interface given by an air–water surface and demonstrate the surface-acoustic-wave-actuated separation of enantiomers (chiral objects) {{on the surface of}} the carrier fluid. It turns out that the dynamics and the separation of the phases do not only depend on parameters such as temperature, mobilities and line tension but also on the mechanics of the <b>lipid</b> <b>layers</b> subjected to exterior forces as, for instance, compression, extensional and shear forces in film-balance experiments. Since the mechanical behavior of <b>lipid</b> <b>layers</b> is viscoelastic, we use a modeling approach based on the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with a viscoelastic stress term and a capillary term, a convective Jeffrey (Oldroyd) equation of viscoelasticity, and the Cahn–Hilliard equation with a transport term. The numerical simulations are based on C 0 -interior-penalty discontinuous-Galerkin methods for the Cahn– Hilliard equation. Model-validation results and the verification of the simulation results by experimental data are presented. The feasibility of enantiomer separation by surface-acoustic-wave-generated vorticity patterns is shown both experimentally and through numerical simulations. This technique is cost-effective and provides an extremely high time resolution of the dynamics of the separation process compared to more traditional approaches. The experimental setup is an enhanced Langmuir–Blodgett film balance with a surface-acoustic-wave-generated vorticity pattern of the fluid, where model enantiomers (custom-made photoresist particles) float {{on the surface of the}} carrier fluid. For the simulations, we propose a finite element immersed boundary method (FEIBM) for deformable enantiomers and a fictitious-domain approach based on a distributed Lagrangian multiplier finite element immersed boundary method (DLM-FEIBM) for rigid chiral objects, both of which lead to simulation results consistent with experiments...|$|R

50|$|While {{working as}} Research Associate at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, Nicolson collaborated with S.J. Singer at the University of California, San Diego. They made a seminal {{model for the}} {{structure}} of cell membranes, which they named the Fluid Mosaic Model, and published in a 12-page paper in the February 18, 1972 issue of Science. It was the first model in cell biology {{to be based on}} thermodynamics properties. Earlier descriptions of the cell membrane had serious inconsistencies with observed properties of the lipid bilayer. According to the Fluid Mosaic Model, in contrast to other models, the cell membrane is composed of a single lipid bilayer which is associated with two groups of proteins. Peripheral proteins are located on the surface, while integral proteins are embedded the <b>lipid</b> <b>layer.</b> The proteins are highly varied, thus, creating a mosaic pattern. Majority of the membrane is composed of phospholipids, which exhibit fluidity like oil. The phospholids are not just stationary, but are able to move, and the proteins can move in the fluid <b>lipid</b> <b>layer.</b> These properties give the membrane flexibility. The model {{turned out to be the}} foundation of modern understanding of cell membrane structure and functions. Although its basic assumptions are still true, the dynamic nature has been underestimated, and more information have been incorporated with new discoveries.|$|E

Time-resolved fluorescence depolarization has been used to detect and characterize the onset of packing defects in binary mixtures of dilinoleoylphosphatidylethanolamine/ 1 -palmitoyl- 2 - oleoylphosphatidylcholine (PE/PC). These PE/PC mixtures exhibit mesoscopic packing defect state (D), as well as one-dimensional lambellar liquid crystalline (L alpha) and two-dimensional inverted hexagonal (HII) ordered phases. Based on previous electron microscopic investigations, this D state is characterized by the presence of interlamellar attachments and precursors of HII phase between the <b>lipid</b> <b>layers.</b> Using a rotational diffusion model for rod-shaped fluorophore in a curved matrix, rotational dynamics parameters, second rank order parameter, localized wobbling diffusion, and curvature-dependent rotational diffusion constants of dipyenylhexatriene (DPH) -labeled PC (DPH-PC) in the host PE/PC matrix were recovered from the measured fluorescence depolarization decays of DPH fluorescence. At approximately 60 % PE, abrupt increases in these rotational dynamics parameters were observed, reflecting the onset of packing defects in the host PE/PC matrix. We have demonstrated that rotational dynamics parameters are very sensitive in detecting the onset of curvature-associating packing defects in lipid membranes. In addition, the presence of the D state can be characterized by the enhanced wobbling diffusional motion and order packing of lipid molecules, and by the presence of localized curvatures in the <b>lipid</b> <b>layers...</b>|$|R

Recently, research into the pathomechanisms of these severe congenital ichthyoses have advanced dramatically and led to the identification of several causative genes and molecules underlying the genetic defects. To date, seven loci have been identified that are associated with ARCI and, among them, five causative genes and molecules have been detected. The five genes are transglutaminase 1 gene (TGM 1), ABCA 12, two lipoxygenase genes, ALOXE 3 and ALOX 12 B and ichthyin. One of these components, ABCA 12, has recently been shown to be a keratinocyte lipid transporter associated with lipid transport in lamellar granules and loss of ABCA 12 function leads to a defective lipid barrier in the stratum corneum, resulting in the HI phenotype.
