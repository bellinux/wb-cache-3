5|$|<b>Lethal</b> <b>injection</b> was {{proposed}} and adopted {{on the grounds}} it was more humane than the methods of execution {{in place at the}} time, such as the electric chair and gas chamber. Opponents of <b>lethal</b> <b>injection</b> reject this argument, noting multiple cases where executions have been either painful, prolonged, or both. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, lethal injections have the highest rate of botched executions of any method used in the US, with 7.12% of executions using this method between 1982 and 2010 considered to have not gone according to plan. A study published in The Lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of <b>lethal</b> <b>injection,</b> the blood level of hypnotics was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness. However, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled 7–2 in 2008 (Baze v. Rees) and 5–4 in 2015 (Glossip v. Gross) that <b>lethal</b> <b>injection</b> does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lethal</b> <b>injection</b> is the {{practice}} of injecting one or more drugs into a person by a government {{for the express purpose}} of causing immediate death. While Nazi Germany was known to execute enemies of the state using an injection of lethal drugs, the first country to legalize and formally implement what is referred to today as <b>lethal</b> <b>injection</b> was the United States. The state of Texas adopted it as its form on capital punishment in 1977 and executed the first person by it, Charles Brooks Jr., in 1982. The practice was subsequently adopted by the other U.S. states using capital punishment. As of 2017, the method is being used by 31 U.S. states, as well as by their federal government and military.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lethal</b> <b>injection</b> {{was also}} adopted {{as a method}} of {{execution}} by Guatemala in 1996, China in 1997, the Philippines in 1999, Thailand in 2003, Taiwan in 2005, and Vietnam in 2013. The Philippines abolished the method in 2006, though a bill to reinstate it passed through the House of Representatives and as of July 2017 is still awaiting debate in the Senate. While it is still legal, no executions have been carried out in Guatemala since 2000, and in Thailand since 2009. The United States and China are the two biggest users of this method of execution. The U.S. had executed 1,283 people via <b>lethal</b> <b>injection</b> as of April 2017. The number of people executed annually in China is thought to surpass all other countries combined, though the actual number is a state secret, and the percentage of people killed via <b>lethal</b> <b>injection</b> and the other method of execution used there, firing squad, is also unclear. This alphabetical list features notable cases up to September 2017, and only those where <b>lethal</b> <b>injection</b> can be reliably sourced to be the method of execution. The criterion for notability is an article on the individual in the English Wikipedia, which inevitably causes a bias towards U.S. executions, as notable individuals in other countries such as Thailand and Vietnam may only have articles in their own language. A complete list of all executions in the United States can be found here.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lethal</b> <b>injections</b> {{have been}} {{increasingly}} employed in China nowadays. Due {{to the lack}} of specific institutions in China’s legislation, there is no universal and definite standard for the options and execution procedure of <b>lethal</b> <b>injections,</b> causing lots of problems. Therefore, an option for <b>lethal</b> <b>injections</b> should be established and relevant execution procedure should be further improved as well...|$|R

5|$|The drug {{has been}} {{introduced}} for use in executions by <b>lethal</b> <b>injection</b> in certain jurisdictions in the United States {{in combination with other}} drugs. It was introduced to replace pentobarbital after the latter's manufacturer disallowed that drug's use for executions.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the highly}} {{reactive}} nature of potassium metal, it must be handled with great care, with full skin and eye protection and preferably an explosion-resistant barrier between the user and the metal. Ingestion of large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to hyperkalemia strongly influencing the cardiovascular system. Potassium chloride {{is used in the}} United States for <b>lethal</b> <b>injection</b> executions.|$|E
50|$|Julius Mount Bleyer (16 March 1859 - 3 April 1915) was a New York {{doctor who}} {{specialized}} in laryngology who took {{a keen interest in}} medical jurisprudence. He studied the methods used for capital punishment and {{as a member of a}} commission, was among the first to propose <b>lethal</b> <b>injections</b> in 1888. He pointed out in The Medico-Legal Journal, the problems with other methods of executing death sentences including decapitation and electrocution. <b>Lethal</b> <b>injections</b> were however not used until the late 1970s.|$|R

During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been re-enacted on March 23, 1973). As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by electric chair and three by <b>lethal</b> <b>injection.</b> Later, as president, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988.|$|E

5|$|Teresa Wilson Bean Lewis (April 26, 1969 – September 23, 2010) was an American murderer who was {{the only}} woman on death row in Virginia prior to her execution. She was sentenced to death by <b>lethal</b> <b>injection</b> for the murders of her husband and stepson in October 2002.

5|$|Hayes is {{an inmate}} of the Connecticut Department of Correction. His {{criminal}} history shows him sentenced {{for his first}} offense {{at the age of}} 16. Subsequent to sentencing for the Petit murders, and up until August 16, 2016 (when he was transferred to a correctional facility in Pennsylvania as part of an interstate corrections compact), he was incarcerated in the Northern Correctional Institution, which houses the state's death row for men, in Somers, Connecticut. The method of execution employed by Connecticut was <b>lethal</b> <b>injection,</b> and the state execution chamber was located in the Osborn Correctional Institution in Somers. This sentence became an automatic life sentence when Connecticut abolished the death penalty in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam {{acts as a}} {{sedative}} {{to render}} the condemned prisoner unconscious, at which time the vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride are administered, stopping the prisoner's breathing and heart, respectively. Florida used midazolam to execute William Happ in October 2013. The usage of midazolam in executions has become controversial after condemned inmate Clayton Lockett apparently regained consciousness and started speaking midway through his execution when the state of Oklahoma attempted to execute him with an untested three-drug <b>lethal</b> <b>injection</b> cocktail using 100mg of midazolam. Prison officials reportedly discussed taking him to a hospital before he was pronounced dead {{of a heart attack}} 40 minutes after the execution began. An observing doctor stated that Lockett's vein had ruptured. It is not clear which drug or drugs caused his death or what quantities of vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride were released before the execution was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|On November 8, 2004, Fletcher {{signed a}} death warrant for Thomas Clyde Bowling, {{who was convicted}} of a double murder in 1990 and sentenced to death by <b>lethal</b> <b>injection.</b> A group of doctors {{requested}} an investigation by the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure to determine whether Fletcher's medical license should be revoked for that action. Kentucky requires doctors to follow the guidelines of the American Medical Association, which forbid doctors from participating in an execution. On January 13, 2005, the Board of Medical Licensure found that Fletcher was acting in his capacity as governor, not as a doctor, when he signed the warrant and ruled that his license was not subject to forfeiture by that action.|$|E

5|$|On Rubicun III, the Edo {{explain to}} Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and Worf that capital {{punishment}} {{is used to}} enforce their laws. The away team rush to warn Wesley, only to discover he has accidentally broken a greenhouse while playing catch with the Edo youths. An Edo policeman attempts to give Wesley a <b>lethal</b> <b>injection</b> for this infraction of the law, but Yar and Worf draw their phasers. On the ship, the sphere leaves Data's body and departs. Picard, upon hearing of the situation with Wesley, transports to the surface. He meets {{with representatives of the}} Edo in a council chamber and explains that Earth no longer practices capital punishment. Some Edo interpret this stance as an attempt by the Federation to push their superiority and suggest that Picard should mount a rescue effort for the boy. He says he cannot, quoting the Prime Directive.|$|E
5|$|This {{alphabetical}} list contains notable {{people whose}} deaths can be reliably sourced {{to be the}} result of drug overdose or acute drug intoxication. Where sources indicate drug overdose or intoxication was only suspected to be the cause of death, this will specified in the 'notes' column. Where sources are able to indicate, deaths are specified as 'suicide', 'accidental', 'undetermined', or otherwise in the 'cause' column. Where sources do not explicitly state intent, they will be listed in this column as 'unknown'. Deaths from accidents or misadventure caused by drug overdoses or intoxication are also included on this list. Deaths from long-term effects of drugs, such as tobacco-related cancers and cirrhosis from alcohol, are not included, nor are deaths from <b>lethal</b> <b>injection</b> or euthanasia.|$|E
5|$|The jury deliberated for 23hours. On June 2, 1997, McVeigh {{was found}} guilty on 11counts of murder and conspiracy. Although the defense argued for a reduced {{sentence}} of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced to death. In May 2001, the Justice Department announced that the FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3,000documents to McVeigh's defense counsel. The Justice Department also announced that the execution would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents. On June 6, federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered the execution to proceed. After President George W. Bush approved the execution (McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the President must approve the execution of federal prisoners), he was executed by <b>lethal</b> <b>injection</b> at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, on June 11. The execution was transmitted on closed-circuit television so that the relatives of the victims could witness his death. McVeigh's execution was the first federal execution in 38years.|$|E

5|$|A {{social worker}} announces to Brian {{and the rest}} of his family that Brian is sentenced to be put down by a <b>lethal</b> <b>injection,</b> which shocks everyone. While Peter works on Brian's appeal, Brian decides to study the Law as much as he can, and goes to court to defend himself, and finally gets the chance to plead his case before the Quahog City Council. During his parole hearing, he {{references}} the court case Plessy v. Ferguson, but unfortunately for him, the council believes that it's stupid to listen to a dog. Just when Brian is about to be dismissed, Peter steps in and delivers a last-ditch emotional appeal on his behalf. The city council members remain unmoved until Peter bribes them with $20 each, and Brian is immediately freed. The charges against him are finally dropped and the town shows him new respect, allowing him to finally drink out of a water fountain, showing his status to be the same as that of the other citizens of the community. The family returns home and Stewie, in an unusual (at the time) display of respect towards Brian, bows ever so slightly towards him. Brian and Peter are then left alone. Brian licks Peter's face in an endearing dog gesture, and threatens to kill him if he ever tells anyone about it.|$|E
5|$|Cisneros and Martínez {{were arrested}} and charged with capital murder, which in Texas is {{punishable}} with a life sentence or death by <b>lethal</b> <b>injection.</b> Cisneros was taken to the Cameron County jail. On her way there, reporters asked if she was responsible for Fischer's murder, and she shook her head. Cisneros' husband also refused to comment. The police denied her bail, but her attorney said that she was a respected member of the Brownsville community and deserved bail. Cisneros's attorney told the press that the arrest was a mistake, and that he was confident the police had no solid evidence against her. Police responded by saying they were content with her arrest, but still needed to go after other people involved in the murder plot. Martínez' family also said they were shocked by the arrest, saying they hoped it was a mistake, and {{that they did not know}} the Fischers or Cisneros. On April 13, Cisneros was released from prison on a $300,000 bond, refusing to comment as she left. According to court documents, Cisneros did not go before a judge to obtain a bond. Her attorney reached an agreement with the Cameron County Court District after her bond was denied the week before. Martínez remained in prison, and her bond was set at the same amount the next day. Her lawyer stated that she deserved a bond as well because she was a senior citizen and had a clean criminal record.|$|E
