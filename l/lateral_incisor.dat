5|$|Microdontia of {{a single}} tooth {{is more likely to}} occur in a maxillary <b>lateral</b> <b>incisor.</b> The second most likely tooth to have microdontia are third molars. Macrodontia of all the teeth is known to occur in {{pituitary}} gigantism and pineal hyperplasia. It may also occur {{on one side of the}} face in cases of hemifacial hyperplasia.|$|E
25|$|Mixed {{dentition}} starts {{when the}} first permanent molar appears in the mouth, usually at six years, and lasts until the last primary tooth is lost, usually at eleven or twelve years. Permanent teeth in the maxilla erupt in a different order from permanent teeth on the mandible. Maxillary teeth erupt in the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) <b>lateral</b> <b>incisor,</b> (4) first premolar, (5) second premolar, (6) canine, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Mandibular teeth erupt in the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) <b>lateral</b> <b>incisor,</b> (4) canine, (5) first premolar, (6) second premolar, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Since there are no premolars in the primary dentition, the primary molars are replaced by permanent premolars. If any primary teeth are lost before permanent teeth are ready to replace them, some posterior teeth may drift forward and cause space to {{be lost in the}} mouth. This may cause crowding and/or misplacement once the permanent teeth erupt, which is usually referred to as malocclusion. Orthodontics may be required in such circumstances for an individual to achieve a straight set of teeth.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{dentition}} {{starts on}} {{the arrival of}} the mandibular central incisors, usually at eight months, and lasts until the first permanent molars appear in the mouth, usually at six years. The primary teeth typically erupt in the following order: (1) central incisor, (2) <b>lateral</b> <b>incisor,</b> (3) first molar, (4) canine, and (5) second molar. As a general rule, four teeth erupt for every six months of life, mandibular teeth erupt before maxillary teeth, and teeth erupt sooner in females than males. During primary dentition, the tooth buds of permanent teeth develop below the primary teeth, close to the palate or tongue.|$|E
30|$|No {{significant}} difference in root resorption between the central and <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors</b> was revealed, except for the lower right incisors. There was a tendency, however, for more root resorption for the <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors</b> compared with the central incisors. Recent studies by Nanekrungsan et al. [25] and Lund et al. [3] found <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors</b> to be more often and seriously affected by root resorption.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose was}} to obtain {{information}} about the relation between agenesis and shape anomaly of maxillary <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors</b> and canine impaction. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with canine impaction and 73 control patients, without canine impaction, were evaluated. The mesiodistal distances of the maxillary <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors</b> adjacent to the impacted canines and the correspondent mandibular <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors</b> were measured. The adjacent <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors</b> were classified in: 1 - absent, 2 - small, 3 - peg-shaped, 4 - standard. RESULTS: The results showed that among the patients with impacted canines, there were 21 anomalous teeth (small and peg-shaped) and among the control patients {{there were only three}} small and peg-shaped teeth, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0. 001). No patients were found with impacted canines and absent <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors.</b> CONCLUSION: It was concluded that in patients with anomalous <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors</b> (small and peg-shaped) there is a probability to present impacted canines and this must be considered...|$|R

25|$|Anodontia is a {{complete}} lack of tooth development, and hypodontia {{is a lack of}} some tooth development. Anodontia is rare, most often occurring in a condition called Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, while hypodontia {{is one of the most}} common developmental abnormalities, affecting 3.58.0% of the population (not including third molars). The absence of third molars is very common, occurring in 2023% of the population, followed in prevalence by the second premolar and <b>lateral</b> <b>incisor.</b> Hypodontia is often associated with the absence of a dental lamina, which is vulnerable to environmental forces, such as infection and chemotherapy medications, and is also associated with many syndromes, such as Down syndrome and Crouzon syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Six {{isolated}} {{permanent teeth}} were found. They consisted of an upper <b>lateral</b> <b>incisor,</b> upper third premolar, upper fourth premolar, upper first molar, and an upper second molar, {{as well as}} 121 cranial fragments. All of the teeth found had complete crowns with developed roots. The varying size of the roots in each tooth {{make it difficult to}} determine if they are damaged, or the length they are because of development. It was determined that all of the pieces belonged to a 9-12-year-old juvenile. The sex of this particular fossil remains unknown. The teeth found have Neanderthal features, as some of them show Taurodontism, which is primarily found in the Neanderthal morphology. Studies of the pieces of cranium found are more ambiguous and harder to link to Neanderthals. The Parietal bone has a stronger likeness to anatomically modern humans, while other bones of the skull can be linked to Neanderthal craniums. Most researchers believe that this particular fossil is a Neanderthal because of the analysis of its dentition.|$|E
500|$|The maxillary {{teeth are}} the maxillary central incisor, maxillary <b>lateral</b> <b>incisor,</b> maxillary canine, maxillary first premolar, maxillary second premolar, maxillary first molar, maxillary second molar, and maxillary third molar. The mandibular teeth are the mandibular central incisor, mandibular <b>lateral</b> <b>incisor,</b> mandibular canine, mandibular first premolar, mandibular second premolar, mandibular first molar, mandibular second molar, and mandibular third molar. Third molars are {{commonly}} called [...] "wisdom teeth" [...] and may never erupt {{into the mouth}} or form at all. If any additional teeth form, for example, fourth and fifth molars, which are rare, they {{are referred to as}} supernumerary teeth (hyperdontia). Development of fewer than the usual number of teeth is called hypodontia.|$|E
30|$|Maxillary <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors</b> {{exhibited}} a higher frequency of CMT {{in both the}} hypodontia group and the oligodontia group in the current study. In a few reports, the frequency of tooth agenesis of maxillary <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors</b> was reduced in severe tooth agenesis patients compared to mild tooth agenesis patients [4, 5, 31]. In the current study, however, the frequency was still high. Moreover, maxillary <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors</b> exhibited the greatest difference in the oligodontia group, as has been reported by other researchers [20, 22]. Thus, {{it is possible that}} these teeth may be more susceptible to disturbances during development than other teeth because maxillary <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors</b> have simpler morphology, which may be more easily affected than that of any other teeth.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the report}} was to {{highlight}} the rarity of occurrence of bilaterally fused mandibular primary <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors</b> and canines {{by virtue of the}} number of such cases reported in literature; to identify congenital absence of successor teeth;and to evaluate their pulpal morphologies to understand the type of fusion. Clinical observation along with an orthopantomograph and periapical radiographs were used to arrive at a diagnosis. The pulpal morphologies varied in each of the fused teeth although both were fusions of the Complete type. There was congenital absence of the permanent mandibular <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors,</b> bilaterally. It was a case of bilateral fusion of mandibular primary <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors</b> and canines of the Complete type with congenitally absent mandibular permanent <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors.</b> Only 13 such cases have been previously reported in literature...|$|R
30|$|The {{association}} between tooth agenesis and DMC was statistically attributable {{only at the}} lack of maxillary <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors.</b> Stepwise multiple logistic regressions dropped from the initial model all variables except for agenesis of maxillary <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors</b> whereas the mandibular second premolar or other types of agenesis did not show any significant association.|$|R

In the lower dental arch the first bicuspids were extracted. Composite resin build-up was performed on the maxillary <b>lateral</b> <b>incisors</b> and canines.
