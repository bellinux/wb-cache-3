25|$|Before being {{accepted}} {{to a higher}} education programme in Sweden, all applicants must demonstrate a minimum proficiency in Swedish and English by either taking 2 years of Swedish and English or passing Swedish B and English A. For international applicants, the Test in Swedish for University Studies (TISUS), is an international exam {{that can be taken}} to demonstrate proficiency in Swedish. For those whose native language is not English, international applicants can demonstrate proficiency in English by obtaining a minimum score of 173 points on the TOEFL or a minimum grade of B on the Cambridge First Certificate in English exam.

25|$|Still {{interested}} in academic programs, Zhou traveled to Britain in January 1921 to visit Edinburgh University. Concerned by financial problems and <b>language</b> <b>requirements,</b> {{he did not}} enroll, returning to France {{at the end of}} January. There are no records of Zhou entering any academic program in France. In spring 1921, he joined a Chinese Communist cell. Zhou was recruited by Zhang Shenfu, whom he had met in August of the previous year in connection with Li Dazhao. He also knew Zhang through Zhang's wife, Liu Qingyang, a member of the Awakening Society. Zhou has sometimes been portrayed at this time as uncertain in his politics, but his swift move to Communism suggests otherwise.|$|E
25|$|A {{government}} decree of March 1982 {{sought to}} provide greater employment {{security for the}} increasing number of workers on part-time and fixed-term contracts by restricting the circumstances in which employers could use such labour (this was largely to ensure that permanent employees were not displaced by cheaper and more easily dismissed part-time workers). The law set out to ensure that such workers receive the same benefits as full-time workers and trade unions were given statutory rights to institute legal proceedings against employers or temporary work agencies if the provisions of the new law were evaded. That same year, the government passed legislation to ensure the full, legal eligibility of women for all civil service posts and an active policy was adopted to encourage them to come forward for promotion. In 1981, legislation was passed which permitted the establishment of local private radio stations. In March 1982, a “Special Statute” was granted to Corsica, which set the territory apart legally from other regions and provided it with additional state subsidies and greater autonomy over cultural, social, economic, and educational policies. Various measures were also introduced to improve conditions for migrants. A new drive began in 1981 to encourage local authorities to establish programmes including literacy programmes, housing schemes, and the setting up of young people’s and women’s groups, and in 1983 France ratified the Council of Europe’s Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers. The Association Law of 1981 allowed foreigners {{for the first time to}} form associations in France under the same rules that governed citizens, and these new immigrant associations were thereafter eligible to receive public funding. New policies removed the French <b>language</b> <b>requirements</b> of immigrants to run for seats in employee institutions, and foreign workers became eligible for the first time to sit on important industrial relations councils known as the Conseils des Prud’hommes. In 1982, an existing programme to assist the repatriation of Algerian nationals was replaced by a system offering a choice between vocational training, assistance to set up a small business and a repatriation grant.|$|E

40|$|In {{the light}} of a massive migratory {{movement}} who in 2015 resulted in more than 160 000 asylum applications in Sweden, a need for a good integration arises, which is partly linked to employment and an open labor market for everyone. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate an employer's right to set <b>language</b> <b>requirement</b> when recruiting and what consequences this may cause for people who do not have Swedish as their native language. In order to achieve the purpose of the study, a jurisprudential method is primarily used with elements of the EU legal method. There is also a social scientific method in the study to illustrate the consequences of the <b>language</b> <b>requirement.</b> The investigation shows that an employer may set <b>language</b> <b>requirement</b> when recruiting if there is a legitimate purpose and the means used are appropriate and necessary to achieve the purpose of the <b>language</b> <b>requirement,</b> otherwise this could result in indirect discrimination on grounds of ethnicity. The conclusion shows that the law is vague regarding the application of the <b>language</b> <b>requirement</b> and an employer can easily get around the legislation with convenient arguments used in court. Two future scenarios in the analysis also shows that the impact of <b>language</b> <b>requirement</b> could lead to ethnic systematic discrimination in cases of glibly using. It can also have the opposite effect in terms of strengthening integration in the workplace and in society in cases of restrictively using...|$|R

2500|$|As {{the decade}} of the 1920s unfolded, the New Humanists began to seem {{increasingly}} irrelevant, and as the Depression of the 1930s hit, the intellectual climate turned decidedly leftward and other forms of criticism emerged, initially from writers outside the academy, some of which, in the coming decades would be incorporated as aspects of the New Criticism. Meanwhile, although there was continued chafing against the supposed antiquarianism of the philological school in some quarters, Kittredge's prestige and influence continued unabated, and the extensive list of <b>language</b> <b>requirements</b> for a Harvard graduate degree in English literature, including Old and Middle English, Old French, and Gothic, stayed in effect until his retirement in 1936, after which these requirements, viewed as onerous, were dropped. With the coming of the Cold War in the late 1940s, 50s and early 60s disagreements between the historical and [...] "literary appreciation" [...] schools in English literature studies were subsumed by the ascendancy of the New Criticism which favored, like Kittredge, rigorous study of literary text, but sidestepped potential controversies over ideology by ruling out mention of historical context or social questions. In consequence, the concept of philology itself fell into disrepute and never recovered, even after social engagement once again became respectable and the New Criticism gave way to Structuralism, Gender Studies, Post Modernism, and the New Historicism. Thus, the context of Kittredge's prestige and his place in the history of English literature studies became obscured and forgotten, a situation which in recent years some scholars are attempting to rectify. As Jill Terry Rudy writes:In the process of overthrowing Kittredge’s perceived pedantry in order to enshrine New Critical methods of rigorous research and institutional control over graduate training and doctoral degrees (without offering the concomitant grounding in cultural history and linguistic concerns that Kittredge promoted), New Critical literary scholars assured that the term philology itself would be denigrated and then ignored as their newly trained graduate students conquered the vocabulary and intricacies of critical scholarship (Wellek 1953). As suggested previously, the philosophical methods and ideologies that informed the early history of English department organization deserve continued conversation and critique rather than simply being erased or ignored.|$|E
