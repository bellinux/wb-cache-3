5|$|Houphouët-Boigny {{was also}} a major {{contributor}} to the political tensions in Biafra. Considering Nigeria a potential danger to French-influenced African states, Foccart sent Houphouët-Boigny and <b>Lieutenant-Colonel</b> Raymond Bichelot on a mission in 1963 to monitor political developments in the country. The opportunity to weaken the former British colony presented itself in May 1967, when Biafra, led by <b>Lieutenant-Colonel</b> Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, undertook to secede from Nigeria. French-aligned African countries supported the secessionists who, provided with mercenaries and weapons by Jean Mauricheau-Beaupré, began a civil war. By the end of the 1960s, French-supported nations suddenly and openly distanced themselves from France and Côte d'Ivoire's position on the civil war. Isolated on the international scene, both countries decided to suspend their assistance to Ojukwu, who eventually went into exile in Côte d'Ivoire.|$|E

5|$|When war was {{declared}} in August 1914, the Liverpool Scottish mobilised {{and moved to}} Scotland {{under the command of}} <b>Lieutenant-Colonel</b> William Nicholl. Duplicate battalions were formed in Liverpool from personnel unable to volunteer for overseas service. The second-line battalion, designated as the 2/10th to distinguish it from the original, was organised in October, the third-line in May 1915. They became responsible for the training of recruits and provision of drafts for overseas service. The 2/10th, raised and organised by Captain (later <b>Lieutenant-Colonel)</b> Adam Fairrie, was committed to the Western Front in 1917. The third-line remained in Britain {{for the duration of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|With actor Richard Dean Anderson's {{departure}} from the show in 2005, Stargate SG-1 saw cast changes {{at the beginning of}} season 9. Ben Browder and Beau Bridges joined the main cast as <b>Lieutenant-Colonel</b> Cameron Mitchell and Major General Hank Landry, respectively. At the same time, the producers re-introduced Vala in a six-episode story arc to cover for the maternity leave of SG-1 regular Amanda Tapping (<b>Lieutenant-Colonel</b> Samantha Carter). The producer intended to use Vala's unpredictability and wildcard status to break the bigger story arc and to acquaint the audience with the new characters. Claudia Black wished to broaden her horizon in comedic acting and agreed to the recurring role, but declined the producers' offer of a permanent role for personal reasons.|$|E

5|$|At 05:45, <b>Lieutenant-Colonel</b> Mehmet Sefik of the Turkish 27th Infantry Regiment {{received}} {{orders to}} move his 1st and 3rd Battalions {{to the west and}} support the 2nd Battalion around Gaba Tepe. The two battalions were already assembled, having spent that night carrying out military exercises. They could not be sent to Ari Burnu as it was not marked on the Turkish maps. Colonel Halil Sami, commanding the 9th Division, also ordered the division's machine-gun company and an artillery battery to move in support of the 27th Infantry Regiment, followed soon after by an 77mm artillery battery. At 08:00 <b>Lieutenant-Colonel</b> Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division, was ordered to send a battalion to support them. Kemal instead decided to go himself with the 57th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battery towards Chunuk Bair, which he realised was the key point in the defence; whoever held those heights would dominate the battlefield. By chance, the 57th Infantry were supposed to have been on an exercise that morning around Hill 971 and had been prepared since 05:30, waiting for orders.|$|E
5|$|At {{daylight}} 4th Parachute Brigade {{started moving}} east towards the division at Oosterbeek, where the KOSB, {{moving through the}} night, had already arrived. Only the parachute battalions and brigade troops remained outside of the village. The order of march was 10 Para followed by brigade troops then 156 Para bringing up the rear. Virtually surrounded, the brigade fought a running hand-to-hand battle with German infantry supported by armour as they attempted to break through. During the fighting commanding officer <b>Lieutenant-Colonel</b> Des Voeux and the second in command of 156 Para were killed in action. Another high ranking casualty was the commanding officer of 10 Para <b>Lieutenant-Colonel</b> Ken Smyth, who was wounded and became a prisoner of war. With 156 Para leading, {{the remnants of the}} brigade carried out a bayonet charge and cleared the Germans from a large hollow which provided some shelter for the exhausted troops. Pinned down all day and with their numbers dwindling, at 17:00 Brigadier Hackett led a charge towards the divisions position, only the Brigadier and 150 men made it.|$|E

5|$|During the Phoney War the Netherlands officially {{adhered to}} {{a policy of}} strict neutrality. In secret, the Dutch {{military}} command, partly acting on its own accord, negotiated with both Belgium and France via the Dutch military attaché in Paris, <b>Lieutenant-Colonel</b> David van Voorst Evekink to coordinate a common defence to a German invasion. This failed because of insurmountable differences of opinion {{about the question of}} which strategy to follow.|$|E
