25|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Bolte intended to proceed with the execution, a secret eleventh-hour plea for mercy was made by four of the jury members. They sent petitioning letters to the Governor of Victoria, Sir Rohan Delacombe, stating that in reaching their verdict they believed that capital punishment had been abolished in Victoria and requested that the governor exercise the Royal Prerogative of Mercy and commute Ryan's sentence of death. Such Melbourne newspapers as The Age, The Herald and The Sun all ran campaigns opposing the hanging of Ryan. The papers ran a campaign of spirited opposition {{on the grounds that the}} death penalty was barbaric. Churches, universities, unions and a large number of the public and <b>legal</b> <b>professions</b> opposed the death sentence. An estimated 18,000 people participated in street protests and around 15,000 signed a petition against the hanging. The Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) suspended radio broadcasts for two minutes as a protest.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century and prior to the revolution, many women leaders emerged and demanded basic social rights for women. During the reign of Reza Shah, the government mandated the removal of the veil and promoted the education of young girls. However, the push-back of the Shii clerics made progress difficult, and the government had to contain its promotion of basic women's rights to the norms of the patriarchal social hierarchy in order to accommodate the clergy. After the abdication of Reza Shah in 1941, the discipline of the government decreased, and women were able to further exercise their rights, including the ability to wear the veil if they wanted. More organization of women's groups occurred in the 1960s and 70s, and they used the government’s modernization to define and advocate for women’s issues. During these decades, women became active in formerly male domains such as the parliament, the cabinet, armed forces, <b>legal</b> <b>professions,</b> and fields of science and technology. Additionally, women achieved the right to vote in 1963. Many of these achievements and rights that Iranian women had gained in the decades leading up to the revolution were reversed by the Islamic Revolution.|$|E

500|$|The {{marriage}} of this seeming unlikely pair caused a scandal throughout the Empire.

If he had converted to Lutheranism and resigned from his electoral and episcopal responsibilities, the marriage might have made a ripple in social circles, but his refusal to give up his electoral and episcopal responsibilities, his declaration of the electorate as henceforth a dynastic property, however, made his {{marriage of}} utmost political importance. Furthermore, his conversion to Calvinism was heresy, because Calvinism was not one of the two <b>legal</b> <b>professions</b> of faith accepted by the Peace of Augsburg in 1556.|$|E

2500|$|Rape {{is defined}} in most jurisdictions as sexual intercourse, {{or other forms of}} sexual penetration, {{committed}} by a perpetrator against a victim without their consent. The definition of rape is inconsistent between governmental health organizations, law enforcement, health providers, and <b>legal</b> <b>professions.</b> It has varied historically and culturally. Originally, rape had no sexual connotation and is still used in other contexts in English. In Roman law, it or raptus was classified as a form of crimen vis, [...] "crime of assault". Raptus described the abduction of a woman against the will of the man under whose authority she lived, and sexual intercourse was not a necessary element. Other definitions of rape have changed over time. In the US, a husband could not be charged with raping his wife until 1979. In the 1950s, in some states in the U.S., a white woman having consensual sex with a black man was considered rape.|$|E

Dickens put his character [...] "Pip", in Great Expectations, in residence at Barnard's Inn opposite, now occupied by Gresham College. Staple Inn, notable as the promotional image for Old Holborn tobacco, is nearby. The three of these were Inns of Chancery. The most northerly of the Inns of Court, Gray's Inn, is off Holborn, as is Lincoln's Inn: the area {{has been associated with}} the <b>legal</b> <b>professions</b> since mediaeval times, {{and the name of the}} local militia (now Territorial Army unit, the Inns of Court & City Yeomanry) still reflects that. Subsequently, the area diversified and become recognisable as the modern street. A plaque stands at number 120 commemorating Thomas Earnshaw's invention of the Marine chronometer, which facilitated long-distance travel. At the corner of Hatton Garden was the old family department store of Gamages. Until 1992, the London Weather Centre was located in the street. The Prudential insurance company relocated in 2002. The Daily Mirror offices used to be directly opposite it, but the site is now occupied by Sainsbury's head office.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Study is to empirically examine the {{diversity}} of the <b>legal</b> <b>profession.</b> The primary distinctive features of this empirical analysis are that it evaluates diversity in the <b>legal</b> <b>profession</b> by (a) carefully comparing it against other prestigious professions that have significant barriers to entry, and (b) focusing on young individuals who recently began their careers. These distinctions are made to isolate anomalies that are more likely caused by forces specific to the <b>legal</b> <b>profession</b> rather than general social forces that limit the eligibility of historically disadvantaged groups to pursue prestigious employment opportunities. Further, by narrowing our focus to attorneys who recently began their careers, we get a clearer picture of the current state of diversity. In contrast to prior studies, we find that, although woefully underrepresented as a whole in the <b>legal</b> <b>profession,</b> the representation of young African Americans and Hispanic Americans in the <b>legal</b> <b>profession</b> is comparable to the representation of these groups in other prestigious professions. This finding suggests that the underrepresentation of African Americans and Hispanic Americans in the <b>legal</b> <b>profession</b> may be caused primarily by social forces external to the <b>legal</b> <b>profession,</b> and that, in addition to continuing its current diversity efforts, the <b>legal</b> <b>profession</b> should put a concentrated emphasis on initiatives that assist these underrepresented groups to become eligible to pursue all types of prestigious employment opportunities that have significant barriers to entry. Further, we find that Asian Americans, in contrast to other minorities, are very poorly represented in the <b>legal</b> <b>profession</b> as compared to other prestigious professions. Finally, there is some evidence suggesting that women were relatively well represented in the <b>legal</b> <b>profession</b> when compared to other prestigious professions until recently, when they appear to have become slightly underrepresented. This recent drop may be caused by the failure of the <b>legal</b> <b>profession</b> to provide just and inclusive workplaces, leading to greater dissatisfaction and higher attrition rates among female associates...|$|R
