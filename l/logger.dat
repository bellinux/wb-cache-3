5|$|The {{son of a}} <b>logger,</b> Amondson {{was born}} into a Pacific Northwest {{lumberjack}} culture laden with alcoholism. He became interested in the temperance movement while attending Divinity School. After establishing himself as a preacher and artist in the community of Vashon Island, Washington, Amondson began touring the nation reenacting Billy Sunday sermons and attending events dressed as the Grim Reaper to protest alcohol corporations.|$|E
5|$|A {{scheme to}} {{circumvent}} the settler grants altogether soon emerged. A railroad official hired a surveyor and <b>logger</b> named Stephen A. Douglas Puter to round up people from Portland saloons, and then {{take them to the}} land office where they would register for an O parcel as a settler, and then promptly resell to the railroad for bundling with other plots and resale to the highest bidder, typically as much as $40 an acre. In 1904, an investigation by The Oregonian uncovered the scandal, by which time it had grown to such a magnitude that the paper reported that more than 75% of the land sales had violated federal law.|$|E
50|$|Early voice <b>loggers</b> {{recorded}} POTS lines onto analog magnetic tape. As telephony {{became more}} digital, so did voice <b>loggers,</b> and {{starting in the}} 1990s, voice <b>loggers</b> digitized the audio using a codec and recorded to digital tape. With modern VoIP systems, many voice <b>loggers</b> now simply store calls to a file on a hard drive.|$|R

Cloutier's older brother, Sylvain is also a hockey player who once captained the OHL's Guelph Storm. After a {{professional}} career with the Coventry Blaze in England, Sylvain became a head coach for the minor professional Corpus Christi IceRays of the CHL in 2008. He is currently player-coach of the Hull Stingrays of the UK Elite League, having held this post since 2009.|$|E
5|$|Crazy Kong {{was officially}} {{licensed}} from Nintendo and manufactured by Falcon for some non-US markets. Nevertheless, Crazy Kong machines {{found their way}} into some American arcades, often installed in cabinets marked as Congorilla. Nintendo was quick to take legal action against those distributing the game in the US. Bootleg copies of Donkey Kong also appeared in both North America and France under the Crazy Kong, Konkey Kong or Donkey King names. The 1982 <b>Logger</b> arcade game from Century Electronics is a direct clone of Donkey Kong, with a large bird standing in for the ape and rolling logs instead of barrels.|$|E
5|$|Bert Combs {{was born}} in the Town Branch section of Manchester, Kentucky on August 13, 1911; he was one of seven {{children}} of Stephen Gibson and Martha (Jones) Combs. Combs's father Stephen, a part-time <b>logger</b> and farmer, was active in local politics, despite being a Democrat in a county where a large majority of residents were Republicans. His mother was a teacher, and she impressed upon her children the importance of a good education. Bert's first school was the two-room Beech Creek grade school. When he reached the seventh grade, his parents sent him and his sister to Oneida Baptist Institute in nearby Oneida because its school term was 8 to 9 months long, as opposed to the 5- to 6-month terms at Beech Creek. Later, Combs and his sister began riding a donkey every day to Clay County High School. Combs excelled academically and skipped some grades, graduating as valedictorian of his class in 1927 at age 15.|$|E

40|$|December 13 - 14, 2006 Siam City Hotel, Bangkok, ThailandData <b>loggers</b> are {{emerging}} as {{a powerful tool for}} quantifying behavioral parameters of aquatic animals. However, {{in the history of the}} study about sea turtles, this approach has been applied only into gravid female turtles which land on the same beach several times within a nesting season because data <b>loggers</b> require physical recovery for data retrieval. Therefore, our knowledge of ecology on sea turtles in the neritic and oceanic environment is still rudimentary. We, in this study, developed an automatic time scheduled release system that allows the <b>loggers</b> to be located and retrieved using VHF radio and ultrasonic signals without recapturing sea turtles. The data logger-recovery experiment was conducted on sea turtles in the neritic environment of the Yaeyama Islands, Okinawa, Japan. We recovered four data <b>loggers</b> and two time scheduled operated release systems at the time we programmed without the data <b>loggers</b> falling out. We demonstrated a high collection rate of data <b>loggers</b> by the recovery system, which means there is viability for the use of various data <b>loggers</b> in the study of ecology of sea turtles...|$|R
5|$|Pattillo Higgins {{was born}} to Roberto James and Sarah (Raye) Higgins on December 5, 1863, in Sabine Pass, Texas. His family moved to Beaumont when he was six years old. He {{attended}} school {{until he reached the}} fourth grade, after which he apprenticed as a gunsmith under his father’s direction. In his youth, he was a violent troublemaker, pulling pranks and harassing African Americans. When he was seventeen, he pulled a prank on a black Baptist church that got the attention of a sheriff deputy. The deputy fired a warning shot over Higgins' head, after which Higgins fired back and delivered what would later {{turn out to be a}} fatal hit. The wounded deputy managed to fire again, striking Higgins lower left arm. Higgins' arm would later become severely infected, requiring amputation from the elbow down. Higgins was put on trial for the murder of the deputy, but he would be found not guilty by a jury that perceived his act as self-defense. After his acquittal, he worked as a <b>logger</b> along the Texas-Louisiana border, apparently unhindered by his lack of an arm. It was in 1885 that he attended a Baptist revival meeting where he made the decision to become a Christian. Realizing that the lumber camps were not the ideal place to maintain a good morality, he decided to return to Beaumont, Texas to establish himself as a businessman.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, Logan {{is working}} as a <b>logger</b> in Canada, where {{he lives with his}} girlfriend Kayla Silverfox. Stryker and Zero {{approach}} Logan at work. Stryker reports that Wade and Bradley have been killed, and he thinks someone is targeting the team's members. Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker, but after finding Kayla's bloodied body in the woods, Logan realizes Victor is responsible. He finds him at a local bar, but Logan loses the subsequent fight. Afterward, Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue, and offers Logan a way to become strong enough to get his revenge. Logan undergoes a painful operation to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium, a virtually indestructible metal. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker attempts to betray Logan by ordering that his memory be erased so he can be used as Stryker's personal weapon, but Logan overhears this and escapes to a nearby farm, where an elderly couple take him in. Zero kills them the following morning and tries to kill Logan, but Logan takes down Zero's helicopter and swears to kill both Stryker and Victor.|$|E

50|$|Given the {{extended}} recording times of data <b>loggers,</b> they typically feature {{a mechanism to}} record the date and time in a timestamp to ensure that each recorded data value {{is associated with a}} date and time of acquisition in order to produce a sequence of events. As such, data <b>loggers</b> typically employ built-in real-time clocks whose published drift can be an important consideration when choosing between data <b>loggers.</b>|$|R
25|$|To perform artisanal logging, the <b>logger</b> {{needs to}} obtain permit {{from the local}} government. With {{approval}} by the community chief, loggers can obtain a permit; yet, they have to report the harvest to local forestry technicians. These local forestry offices are considered the appropriate entity for approving the logging permits while {{they do not have}} the capacity to conduct forest inventory and forest mapping. Since the forest code does not have comprehensive mechanism to stop such logging activities, loggers continue to purchase logging rights from the local community. Depending on the scale of the logging, the community would demand different types of payment from loggers. One community in the North Kivu area, they demanded the <b>logger</b> to give them a 4x4 truck and upgrade the public infrastructures, which are not well provided for by the local government. Although the <b>logger</b> did not accept the request, this illustrates why locals want artisanal logging to exist.|$|E

25|$|The squatters were roused {{initially}} by an October 1849 {{lawsuit filed}} against a <b>logger</b> named Z. M. Chapman, who had constructed {{a log cabin}} nearby Sutter's Fort on Priest, Lee, & Company-owned land. When the commercial institution could not pool sufficient evidence displaying their ownership of the land, Chapman extended his claim, challenging at first Sutter's grants and later on all city-owned land. Charles L. Robinson approved of Chapman's actions and built his own shack on another's private land. The squatting settlers organized the Sacramento City Settlers Organization; Robinson became the group's president.|$|E

25|$|In the Dutch fishery, a {{last was}} a {{measurement}} of the fish loaded into {{the various types of}} fishing boat in use (e.g. a bomschuit, buis, sloep or <b>logger).</b> The last of these could take 35 to 40 last of fish, the exact amount depending on the location. In the South Holland fishing villages of Scheveningen and Katwijk, it amounted to 17 crans (kantjes) of herring; in Vlaardingen 14 packed tons. A cran (kantje) held about 900 to 1,000 herring. In Flanders a last was about 1,000kg of herring. The term fell out of use when the herring fishery disappeared.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 80´s Kjell Eng, {{the founder of}} Engtex, got the idea to use {{textiles}} for protection and cut prevention. Having worked as a <b>logger</b> earlier in life, he was very aware of the danger in using and handling a chainsaw. The first generation of protective fabrics consisted of a multi-layered and specially designed tricot fabric that peeled off layer by layer at contact with the cutting chains. This was the start and the first-ever chainsaw protective fabric was born. Statistics showed a reduction in injuries at work-related accidents in forestry and logging. However the new fabrics did not stop the more severe accidents with deep cuts and lethal outcome.|$|E
