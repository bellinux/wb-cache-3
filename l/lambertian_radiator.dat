[...] The spectral radiance of Planckian radiation from a black body has the same value for every direction and angle of polarization, and so the black body {{is said to be a}} <b>Lambertian</b> <b>radiator.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{emission}} of a <b>Lambertian</b> <b>radiator</b> {{does not depend}} upon the amount of incident radiation, but rather from radiation originating in the emitting body itself. For example, if the sun were a <b>Lambertian</b> <b>radiator,</b> {{one would expect to}} see a constant brightness across the entire solar disc. The fact that the sun exhibits limb darkening in the visible region illustrates {{that it is not a}} <b>Lambertian</b> <b>radiator.</b> A black body is an example of a <b>Lambertian</b> <b>radiator.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{radiance}} or observed {{intensity is}} not a function of direction. Therefore, a black body is a perfect <b>Lambertian</b> <b>radiator.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} model {{approach}} for a simulation and optimization of ray characteristics of autostereoscopic displays. Based on the assignment of view content to single subpixels, ray paths and intensity distributions are rendered {{as a function of}} construction parameters of the modeled display. We investigate models which use parallax barrier arrays as image separating optics. We are able to calculate and visualize an intensity distribution of different views in any chosen distance to the pixel plane. The bidirectional simulation is equally capable of generating rays at user's specific eye position. In our optical model the <b>Lambertian</b> <b>radiator</b> and Fresnel, respectively Fraunhofer diffraction approximation is used. The model assumptions are proved by comparing simulated and experimental data. The various visualization and analysis methods in the simulation can be used to estimate the quality of autostereoscopic imaging. Our aim is to provide a useful tool for optimization of 3 D display design and image processing algorithms...|$|E
