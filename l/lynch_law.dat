5|$|Bradley {{did much}} to {{advance the cause of}} blacks in Kentucky. He denounced racially {{motivated}} lynchings and demanded that county officials prosecute racial violence. He called a special legislative session in March 1897 to consider an anti-lynching bill that imposed penalties including a fine of up to $500 and removal from office for any peace officer who did not prevent a lynching or mob violence. It further empowered peace officers to recruit able-bodied men to help protect prisoners and fined them for failing to do so, if necessary. Despite the politically divided legislature, the bill quickly passed both houses of the General Assembly and Bradley signed it on May 11, 1897. In January 1898, Bradley accepted an invitation to speak before the Anti-Mob and <b>Lynch</b> <b>Law</b> Association in Springfield, Ohio. During Bradley's four-year term, twenty-five lynchings were committed in the state, down from fifty-six during the term of his predecessor.|$|E

25|$|A {{few weeks}} after Stawell's {{appointment}} gold was discovered in Victoria; the duty of creating a system of government which could cope adequately with the situation fell to him. Stawell had to establish a police force, frame regulations for {{the government of the}} goldfields, appoint magistrates and officials of every grade, and protect life and property against the attacks of the hordes of adventurers, many of desperate character, who landed in Victoria, first from the neighbouring colonies, and later from Europe and America. Much was owed to the firm administration of Stawell that, {{at a time when the}} government was weak and a large section of the newcomers impatient of control, <b>lynch</b> <b>law</b> was never resorted to.|$|E

50|$|At the party's convention, they {{selected}} a slate of eighteen delegates for the Democratic convention, adopted a ten point platform, and nominated Osceola E. McKaine for the Senate election. The PDP delegates tried to unseat the white South Carolina delegates {{at the national}} convention, but the executive committee refused {{to go along with}} the scheme. The platform of the PDP included several civil rights issues such as the elimination of the poll tax, a prohibition of racial discrimination in hiring practices, and anti <b>lynching</b> <b>laws.</b> It also included a provision to support the American effort in World War II and the election of President Roosevelt to a fourth term. Osceola McKaine only officially garnered 3,200 votes in the Senate election, but the PDP charged that many of his votes were not counted and estimated that he had over 10,000 votes.|$|R
500|$|On April 19, 1915, the Supreme Court {{denied the}} appeal by a 7–2 {{vote in the}} case Frank v. Mangum. Part of the {{decision}} repeated {{the message of the}} last decision: that Frank failed [...] "to raise the objection in due season when fully cognizant of the fact." [...] Holmes and Charles Evans Hughes dissented, with Holmes writing, [...] "It is our duty to declare <b>lynch</b> <b>law</b> as little valid when practiced by a regularly drawn jury as when administered by one elected by a mob intent on death." ...|$|E
500|$|Slaton opened {{hearings}} on June 12. In addition to receiving presentations {{from both sides}} with new arguments and evidence, Slaton visited the crime scene and reviewed over 10,000 pages of documents. This included various letters, including one written by Judge Roan shortly before he died asking Slaton to correct his mistake. Slaton also received more than 1,000 death threats. During the hearing, former Governor Joseph Brown warned Slaton, [...] "In all frankness, if Your Excellency wishes to invoke <b>lynch</b> <b>law</b> in Georgia and destroy trial by jury, {{the way to do}} it is by retrying this case and reversing all the courts." [...] According to Tom Watson's biographer, C. Vann Woodward, [...] "While the hearings of the petition to commute were in progress Watson sent a friend to the governor with the promise that if Slaton allowed Frank to hang, Watson would be his 'friend', which would result in his 'becoming United States senator and the master of Georgia politics for twenty years to come.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The June 21, 1915 {{commutation}} provoked Tom Watson into advocating Frank's lynching. He {{wrote in}} The Jeffersonian and Watson's Magazine: [...] "This country {{has nothing to}} fear from its rural communities. <b>Lynch</b> <b>law</b> is a good sign; it shows that a sense of justice lives among the people." [...] A group of prominent men organized themselves into the [...] "Knights of Mary Phagan" [...] and openly planned to kidnap Frank from prison. They consisted of 28 men with various skills: an electrician was to cut the prison wires, car mechanics were to keep the cars running, and there was a locksmith, a telephone man, a medic, a hangman, and a [...] The ringleaders were well known locally, but were not named publicly until June 2000, when a local librarian posted a list on the Web, based on information compiled by Mary Phagan's great-niece, Mary Phagan Kean (b. 1953). The list included Joseph Mackey Brown, former governor of Georgia; Eugene Herbert Clay, former mayor of Marietta and later president of the Georgia Senate; E. P. Dobbs, mayor of Marietta at the time; Moultrie McKinney Sessions, lawyer and banker; part of the Marietta delegation at Governor Slaton's clemency hearing; several current and former Cobb County sheriffs; and other individuals of various professions.|$|E

500|$|When {{describing}} the public reaction to Frank, historians mention {{the class and}} ethnic tensions in play while acknowledging {{the complexity of the}} case and the difficulty in gauging the importance of his Jewishness, class, and northern background. Historian John Higham writes that [...] "economic resentment, frustrated progressivism, and race consciousness combined to produce a classic case of <b>lynch</b> <b>law....</b> Hatred of organized wealth reaching into Georgia from outside became a hatred of Jewish wealth." [...] Historian Nancy MacLean writes that some historians have argued that this was an American Dreyfus affair, which she said [...] " [...] be explained only in light of the social tensions unleashed by the growth of industry and cities in the turn-of-the-century South. These circumstances made a Jewish employer a more fitting scapegoat for disgruntled whites than the other leading suspect in the case, a black worker." [...] Albert Lindemann said that Frank on trial found himself [...] "in a position of much latent tension and symbolism." [...] Stating {{that it is impossible to}} determine the extent to which antisemitism affected his image, he concluded that [...] " [...] a representative of Yankee capitalism in a southern city, with row upon row of southern women, often the daughters and wives of ruined farmers, 'at his mercy'a rich, punctilious, northern Jew lording it over vulnerable and impoverished working women." ...|$|E

[...] As described by Guevara Urbina, [...] "residents continued to face displacement from their land as European newcomers began to use violence, <b>lynching,</b> existing <b>laws,</b> or developed new laws, to seize lands previously held by Mexicans or other indigenous groups." ...|$|R

60|$|Here lay the {{legitimate}} {{fruit of the}} State's essential hoodlumism. Here was the answer to local self-government--to democracy. Such a thing could not happen in Australia or Canada; only in America could <b>lynch</b> <b>law</b> become a dramatic pastime, a jest, an instrument of private vengeance. The South and the West were alike stained {{with the blood of}} the lynched, and the whole nation was covered with shame.|$|E

50|$|PTSS {{posits that}} centuries {{of slavery in}} the United States, {{followed}} by systemic and structural racism and oppression, including <b>lynching,</b> Jim Crow <b>laws,</b> and unwarranted mass incarceration, have resulted in multigenerational maladaptive behaviors, which originated as survival strategies.

60|$|Similar scenes {{took place}} in San Francisco, for {{the force of the}} law was wholly {{insufficient}} to restrain the reckless and desperate men who congregated in the towns, and who thought no more of taking life than eating a meal. To put a stop to the frightful state of things prevailing, the more peaceful of the San Francisco citizens had also been obliged to organise a Vigilance Committee to carry out what was called <b>Lynch</b> <b>law,</b> a rough and ready method of justice subject to grave abuses under other circumstances, but admirably suited to such a condition of things as at that time prevailed in California.|$|E

5000|$|John Roy Lynch (September 10, 1847 [...] - [...] November 2, 1939) was an African-American Republican politician, writer, {{attorney}} and military officer.

60|$|Once upon a {{time there}} was Samuelson, a young lawyer, who feared not God, neither {{regarded}} the Bench. (Name, age, and town of the man were given at great length.) To him no case had ever come as a client, partly because {{he lived in a}} district where <b>lynch</b> <b>law</b> prevailed, and partly because the most desperate prisoner shrunk from intrusting himself to the mercies of a phenomenal stammerer. But in time there happened an aggravated murder--so bad, indeed, that by common consent the citizens decided, as a prelude to lynching, to give the real law a chance. They could, in fact, gambol round that murder. They met--the court in its shirt-sleeves--and against the raw square of the Court House window a temptingly suggestive branch of a tree fretted the sky. No one appeared for the prisoner, and, partly in jest, the court advised young Samuelson to take up the case.|$|E
60|$|There did {{not seem}} to be much fear of the big miner's secrets being discovered, for <b>Lynch</b> <b>law</b> prevailed in the camp at that time, and it was well known that death was the usual {{punishment}} for theft. It was also well known that Gashford was a splendid shot with the revolver, as well as a fierce, unscrupulous man. But strong drink revealed that which might have otherwise been safe. When in his cups Gashford sometimes became boastful, and gave hints now and then which were easily understood. Still his gold was safe, for, apart from the danger of the attempt to rob the bully, it would have been impossible to discover the particular part of his tent-floor in which the hole was dug, and, as to venturing to touch his pillow while his shaggy head rested on it, no one was daring enough to contemplate such an act although there were men there capable of doing almost anything.|$|E
