40|$|We {{studied the}} {{comparative}} feeding ecology of three species of colobus (Procolobus badius, Procolobus verus, and Colobus polykomos) on Tiwai Island, Sierra Leone. We collected dietary data on each species by scan-sampling habituated groups. Because these groups {{were observed in}} the same study area during overlapping time periods, the confounding effects of temporal and spatial variability in food availability were reduced. Our {{results show that the}} annual diets of the two larger species (Procolobus badius and Colobus polykomos) include roughly equal proportions of fruits (including seeds), young <b>leaf</b> <b>parts,</b> and mature <b>leaf</b> <b>parts,</b> although P. badius had a greater intake of floral parts. Procolobus verus consumed almost no mature <b>leaf</b> <b>parts,</b> few fruits and seeds, and many young <b>leaf</b> <b>parts.</b> Colobus polykomos commonly fed from lianas. Seeds were the dominant fruit item eaten by all three colobus, and the fruits they selected were generally dull and non-fleshy, in contrast to the brightly-colored, pulpy fruits eaten by guenons. Leguminous plants contributed substantially to the diets of both the larger species, but comparisons with other African forest sites indicate that colobine biomass is not closely correlated with the abundance of leguminous trees in the forest...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a new method for part-based human pose estimation. The key idea of our {{method is to}} improve the {{accuracies}} for <b>leaf</b> <b>parts</b> localizations- an issue that is largely ignored by previous work- by incorporating both local and non-local contextual information into the model. In particular, we use the local contextual information to reduce or eliminate the influences of the noises, while the non-local contextual information helping to improve the detection accuracies of the <b>leaf</b> <b>parts.</b> Since more accurate parts localizations usually mean a more reasonable active set of spatial constraints, this potentially enhances the effectiveness of the subsequent optimization procedure. Furthermore, we keep the basic structure of tree-based model, hence taking the advantage of its conceptual simplicity and computational efficient inference. Our experiments on two challenging real-world datasets demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R

The ethanol extract of Ficus iteophylla leaves (100, 200, and 400 mgkg− 1, i. p) was evaluated for analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities. The analgesic effect was studied using acetic acid-induced abdominal constriction and hot plate test in mice, while the anti-inflammatory effect was investigated using carrageenan induced paw oedema in rats. The ethanol extract at 100 mgkg− 1, 200 mgkg− 1, and 400 mgkg− 1 significantly (P< 0. 05) inhibited acetic acid induced writhes by 1. 50 ± 0. 43, 3. 0 ± 0. 82 and 1. 0 ± 0. 82 respectively. It also exhibited significantly (P< 0. 05) anti-inflammatory by 0. 11 ± 0. 02, 0. 11 ± 0. 03, 0. 08 ± 0. 01 respectively. The preliminary phytochemical screening of the plant extract revealed the presence of flavonoids, steroids, tannins and saponins while the effect of flavonoids, steroids and tannins on analgesic and inflammatory has been reported.

40|$|Foliar shade {{triggers}} {{rapid growth}} of specific structures that facilitate access of the plant to direct sunlight. In leaves of many plant species, this growth response is complex because, although shade triggers the elongation of petioles, it reduces {{the growth of the}} lamina. How the same external cue leads to these contrasting growth responses in different <b>parts</b> of the <b>leaf</b> is not understood. Using mutant analysis, pharmacological treatment and gene expression analyses, we investigated the role of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 7 (PIF 7) and the growth-promoting hormone auxin in these contrasting leaf growth responses. Both petiole elongation and lamina growth reduction are dependent on PIF 7. The induction of auxin production is both necessary and sufficient to induce opposite growth responses in petioles vs lamina. However, these contrasting growth responses are not caused by different auxin concentrations in the two <b>leaf</b> <b>parts.</b> Our work suggests that a transient increase in auxin levels triggers tissue-specific growth responses in different <b>leaf</b> <b>parts.</b> We provide evidence suggesting that this may be caused by the different sensitivity to auxin in the petiole vs the blade and by tissue-specific gene expression...|$|R

40|$|Twenty leaves {{belonging}} to five age groups from four different Aloe hereroensis plants were investigated by anatomical and TLC methods. These {{results indicated that}} most of the phenolic metabolites are located in the vascular bundle sheath. The homonataloin accumulates in the big inner bundle sheath parenchymatous cells and the three isomers of aloeresin isomers are mainly located in the outer bundle sheath cells. Therefore, the different content of these secondary metabolites in the various <b>leaf</b> <b>parts,</b> and different <b>leaf</b> ages, of Aloe hereroensis are positively related to the density of the vascular bundles. Of all 20 leaves, the top thirds had similar density of vascular bundles, as well as the highest content of the secondary metabolites.
