We derive two main results. First, the approval decision on GM products is specific to the labelling regime: approval of GM products is optimal under a labelling regime, whereas non-approval is optimal in the absence of a mandatory <b>labelling</b> <b>requirement.</b> Second, the inability to protect the innovator’s rent through IPR enforcement can prevent the approval of GM products...|$|E

Many cosmetic products which are sold in containers smaller than 125 ml would still not have to be labelled regularly because of the small quantity exception, which reads that only certain H-statements need to be written on the labels (see Table 1). This implies that for example skin irritation (category 2) and eye irritation (category 2) would not have to be written on the label of small containers. For better consumer information, the small quantity exception should be amended so that cosmetic products should be labelled and classified regularly, also when they are sold in smaller packages.|$|E

40|$|This article {{focus on}} the genetically {{modified}} food and <b>labelling</b> <b>requirement.</b> The relatively new technology raises some concerns over the safety of food containing genetically modified substance. The 2 ̆ 2 substantial equivalent 2 ̆ 2 doctrine, adopted by the U.

In this article, we argue that consumers cannot make their own choices and exercise market power without {{a certain degree of}} disclosure of information. However, even though food labelling is an effective way to convey information, {{it is by no means}} a perfect solution. This article will consider several ways to label genetically modified food and the costs or benefits so as to illustrate the best way to disclose information to consumers by way of labelling...|$|E
40|$|Regulation 1829 / 2003 /CE and 1830 / 2003 /CE {{have allowed}} the {{placing on the market}} of GM {{products}} in food and feed chains and have defined their rules of traceability and labelling. For some supply chains like soy and its derived products for feed, manufacturers have to face both non-GM and GM feed production. This is the consequence of no <b>labelling</b> <b>requirement</b> for animal products and development of GM soy crops in the supplying countries. This study presents the strategies of stakeholders involved in the feed chains to maintain production of non-GM soy for feed, by dealing with coexistence between GM and non-GM materials within the feeds chains.

30|$|Certain hazard and precautionary {{statements}} and pictograms {{need not be}} listed on the product label of containers if these are smaller than 125 ml ([1] Annex I 1.5. 2.1. 1, Table 1 B). Shampoos, liquid soap or shower gels are examples of products sold usually in bigger containers than 125 ml, whereas most personal care products, like tooth paste, deodorants, aftershave, perfume, lip stick, or nail varnish are usually sold in smaller containers. (2) Supplemental statements on the product labels inform the consumer if the criteria for classification are not fulfilled, but information exists about a potential hazard e.g. sensitization Table 1 (C)). (3) However, you will find single cosmetic products with labels: Aerosol dispensers, such as hairspray, must be labelled for their physical hazard class as highly flammable according to EC 75 / 324 [5] and CLP Regulation Art. 14 (2)c). This <b>labelling</b> <b>requirement</b> could also mislead some consumers.

In addition, some instant nail glue products made in Switzerland are also labelled, although Switzerland has adopted the CLP Regulation with the exception for cosmetic products.|$|E
40|$|Preliminary, {{please do}} not quote without au r´s permission. Environmental {{labelling}} is crucial {{for the development of}} green markets, where in the presenc of asymmetric information with regard to the environmentally relevant features of a product it is used as a screening (governmental labelling) or signalling (firm labelling) device in order to overcome adverse selection. The problem is then, characterized by an interaction of informational issues and issues of market structure, competition and entry. In order to accou t for both, a one period perfect competition model of a vertically differentiated industry under asymmetric information is considered to address the following issues: (1) Under which conditions, by which mechanism and to what extent does a centralized eco-label promote green entry? (2) What will the outcome look like if, {{in the absence of a}} centralized label, firms introduce their own labels? (3) What are the welfare implications? (4) How are pollution levels affected? A range of pooling and separating equilibria is derived from which follow our main findings. In particular, under rational expectations of average quality (green vs. non-green) and endogenous entry market separation may be achieved, even if the traditional single crossing property condition fails, which requires that an increase in the <b>labelling</b> <b>requirement</b> is strictly more profitable for a green producer. Pollution is reduced by a labelling policy only if entry of green producers is strong enough to exert a degree of competitive pressure on the non-green industry which causes exit but not so strong as to overcompensate the pollution reducing effect from exit...|$|E
40|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of {{different}} chemicals used in common articles. Many hazardous substances are being spread to the environment besides from the use of articles, also from their production and disposal. Management of chemicals in articles is included in EU legislation concerning product safety, waste management, product design and chemicals. There are also other instruments for the management of chemicals in articles, e. g. environmental labelling, international co-operation, industry initiatives, work of the non-governmental organizations as well as national programmes and registers. According to the recommendations of the National Programme on Dangerous Chemicals, more information is needed about chemicals in articles. The aim of this preliminary report is to review how hazards and risks from chemicals in articles could be controlled, through out the life cycles of the articles. This report describes the current legislative situation and voluntary management measures, as well as their possible need for further development. Articles are regarded as e. g. textiles, toys, electrical and electronic equipment, batteries and accumulators as well as packaging. Cosmetics are also included in this report, because they present possible significant source of chemical releases to the environment. On the basis of this preliminary report, the legislation concerning chemicals in articles is very scattered, targeted to certain product groups and substances. EU’s new chemicals regulation, REACH, is the most comprehensive legislation on chemicals in articles, because it is applied to all chemicals. There is a general lack of information on the content of chemicals in articles as well as the environmental effects and risks of those chemicals. The lack of <b>labelling</b> <b>requirement</b> is affecting to the consumers’, manufacturers’ and importers’ level of knowledge about chemicals in articles. The surveillance by the authorities is based on notifications of dangerous articles and spot checks. These however only reveal a small proportion of articles on the market containing hazardous chemicals. The management of chemicals in articles could be enhanced e. g. by adding more restricted chemicals or product groups to individual legislation, by including more environmental aspects in product safety legislation or by adding more restrictions concerning chemicals in articles to the REACH Regulation. In order to supervise the compliance with chemicals legislation, more resources are needed, especially on imported articles coming outside EU. The new Waste Framework Directive and the reform of national waste legislation will enhance the control of chemicals in articles, but the collection, recycling and re-use should be further developed. Information on chemicals in articles could be increased by e. g. developing information systems covering the whole supply chain. The role of product design should be highlighted in the future when aiming to substitute the current use of hazardous chemicals in articles...|$|E
