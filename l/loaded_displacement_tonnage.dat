25|$|One {{explanation}} for the alleged size of these colossal ships was that the largest 44 Zhang treasure ships were merely for a display of imperial power by the Emperor and imperial bureaucrats on the Yangtze River when on court business, including when reviewing Zheng He's actual expedition fleet. The Yangtze River, with its calmer waters, may have been navigable for such large but unseaworthy ships. Zheng He {{would not have had}} the privilege in rank to command the largest of these ships. The largest ships of Zheng He's fleet were the 6 masted 2000-liao ships. This would give burthen of 500 tons and a <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> of about 800 tons.|$|R

30|$|Antenna phase center variations, ocean tidal <b>loading</b> <b>displacements,</b> and {{atmospheric}} <b>loading</b> effects were corrected as standard procedures of high-precision GIPSY-OASIS data processing.

The ocean tidal <b>loading</b> <b>displacements</b> were also corrected for on an epoch-by-epoch basis by utilizing 11 major constituents from NAO. 99 b model (Matsumoto et al., 2000). The atmospheric loading effects at 6 -h intervals were computed using the APLO program (Petrov and Boy, 2004), and the daily average displacement was derived from these atmospheric loading effects. The daily GPS height-time series was then corrected using the daily atmospheric loading values.|$|R

The variability in material properties and geometry is then investigated to identify a range of buckling modes and development of deep postbuckling deformation encountered in the experimental program.
