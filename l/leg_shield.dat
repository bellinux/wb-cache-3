500|$|Specific {{elements}} of the Super Cub's design were integral to the campaign, such as the enclosed chain that kept chain lubricant from being flung on the rider's clothing, and the <b>leg</b> <b>shield</b> that similarly blocked road debris and hid the engine, and the convenience of the semi-automatic transmission. Presenting the Super Cub as a consumer appliance [...] not requiring mechanical aptitude and an identity change into [...] "a motorcyclist", or worse, [...] "a biker", differentiated Honda's offering, because, [...] "the dedication required to maintain bikes of that era limited ownership to a relatively small demographic, often regarded as young men known for their black leather jackets and snarling demeanors." ...|$|E
50|$|Scooters usually feature bodywork, {{including}} a front <b>leg</b> <b>shield</b> and body that conceals {{all or most}} of the mechanicals. There is often some integral storage space, either under the seat, built into the front <b>leg</b> <b>shield,</b> or both. Scooters have varying engine displacements and configurations ranging from 50 cc single-cylinder to 850 cc twin-cylinder models.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the Choinori SS was introduced. Mechanically {{the same}} as the regular Choinori, the SS had the <b>leg</b> <b>shield</b> {{replaced}} by a headstock cover, a different style of handlebar was used, and the turn signals were moved to the handlebars.|$|E
50|$|The MS was a {{modified}} Lambretta Series III with very narrow <b>leg</b> <b>shields</b> and cropped side panels that revealed the engine's crankcase. It was first produced in 1973 and was colloquially {{known as the}} 'mini-saia' (mini-skirt).|$|R
50|$|Since some {{interpretations of}} the Codex Belli {{go as far as}} banning hits against {{the entire length of the}} lower arms and lower <b>legs,</b> <b>shields</b> have become the {{standard}} choice for a secondary weapon in these combats because they can cover the entire legal hit area (torso, upper arms and upper legs).|$|R
5000|$|Journalist L. J. K. Setright {{wrote of}} the CBX's width: [...] "Don't tell me that its engine is too wide: It is no wider than the legs of a rider, so it adds nothing to the frontal area, and {{personally}} I would rather have my <b>legs</b> <b>shielded</b> by a cylinder apiece than exposed to every blow ..." ...|$|R
50|$|These first bikes {{exhibit the}} chief {{characteristics}} of the Trail Cub line. The Super Cub's plastic engine cover and <b>leg</b> <b>shield</b> were removed, exposing the long single tube joining the rear pressed-steel frame with the forks. The bikes have knobby tires, and the Super Cub's large front fender was replaced with a smaller unit to better clear mud. The Trail Cub has a single saddle followed by a large chrome equipment rack, on which a second saddle can be installed. There is also a skid plate to prevent damage to the low-slung engine. As with all Cubs, the gas tank is within the seat pedestal.|$|E

The ad campaign sought to improve the image of motorcycling in general and expand the overall size of the motorcycle market by attracting new riders. In a stroke of good fortune for Honda, Brian Wilson and Mike Love composed the 1964 song [...] "Little Honda", extolling the joys of riding the Honda 50, and even inviting the listener to visit their local Honda dealership, in language that sounded {{as if it could}} have been written, or at least paid for, by Honda's advertising copywriters, yet it was not a commercial jingle. The song was released by The Hondells in 1964, followed by the release of the original recording by The Beach Boys. In 1965 The Hondells released [...] "You Meet the Nicest People on a Honda", another song promoting the Super Cub, which was actually used in Honda's TV spots, as a B side to their version of [...] "Sea Cruise."The long-running campaign, including the slogan, the music, and the upbeat images of respectable, middle and upper-class people, particularly women, riding Hondas became closely associated with the Honda brand ever since. The image Honda created was contrasted with the one percenter [...] "bad boy" [...] biker and became a focal point of Japan bashing boosterism of US-made Harley-Davidson motorcycles.|$|E
5000|$|The L was a [...] "Luxus" [...] (luxury) version. On the L, {{the regular}} Quickly pressed steel frame was given {{attachment}} points for a swingarm and a unit encompassing the rear fender and spring/damper units for the rear suspension. <b>Leg</b> <b>shields</b> were optional on the L. 86,380 Quickly L mopeds were manufactured from 1956 to 1961.|$|R
5000|$|The Honda PC50 is a moped {{produced}} by the Honda Motor Company in Japan from May 1969 until February 1977. The PC50, though much smaller and lighter, had some similar features to Honda's popular C50 /70 /90 Super Cub line, with a step-through pressed-steel frame, a fuel tank under the saddle, a chain cover, and optionally equipped with <b>leg</b> <b>shields,</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The Model LC was a Model C {{with full}} <b>leg</b> <b>shields,</b> side panels and rear running boards, the first Lambretta to do so, the 'L' stands for Lusso, meaning luxury in English. The side panel {{featured}} an access panel so the rider could {{turn on the}} choke without removing the side panel. Due to the side panels direct engine cooling could not work, so the flywheel gained cooling fins.|$|R
50|$|At the 2011 Summer Universiade in Shenzhen, Shields {{earned the}} first {{international}} medal of his career, a gold, in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay for his contribution in the heats. As the second <b>leg,</b> <b>Shields</b> had a split of 1:50.57. Shields earned his first individual medal, a silver, in the 100-meter butterfly, finishing behind compatriot Tim Phillips. Shields also earned a silver medal in the 4×100-meter medley relay for his contribution in the heats.|$|R
50|$|The {{range was}} {{designed}} by Nuccio Bertone and was made shorter with a rectangular headset and slimmer <b>leg</b> <b>shields.</b> It also had black trim and a new shaped mudguard to make the GP/DL look more sporting. An ink splat {{was used as the}} logo for the DL but in the United Kingdom the GP used a checkered flag. The GP Electronic was designed between Innocenti and Ducati and came with an electronic ignition.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{using the}} Trophy, UK police forces {{successfully}} deployed Speed Twin and Thunderbird models. The Trophy version, codenamed the TR6P, carried the model name [...] "Saint" [...] (Stop Anything In No Time). These {{had a special}} petrol tank which typically accommodated a PYE radio telephone. It had panniers, a fairing or <b>leg</b> <b>shields.</b> These were sold between 1967 and 1973. The factory varied the specification slightly according {{to the needs of}} the individual police force.|$|R
5000|$|Mota Maschinenbau GmbH {{developed}} a two-wheel-vehicle between 1948 and 1952 which should unite {{the advantages of}} a scooter and motorbike: The Wiesel had <b>leg</b> <b>shields</b> and a carrier on the backside. The engines were produced by the company itself in different variations: 50, 75 and 98 cm³ of cubic capacity. Often the saddle wasn’t height-adjustable, but adjustable to the front or back. A toolbox was installed just behind of it. The Wiesel was produced with the following high-quality components: ...|$|R
50|$|Their colour {{ranges from}} intense red to golden yellow. They have yellow hairy <b>legs.</b> Their <b>shield</b> is {{marked with a}} series of furrows.|$|R
5000|$|The Velocette LE was {{launched}} at the British International Motor Show at Earls Court in 1948 as the [...] "Motorcycle for Everyman". With a 149 cc four-stroke, side-valve, water-cooled, horizontally opposed twin-cylinder engine, the LE {{also had a}} radiator and was fitted with coil ignition to help starting. The hand change three-speed gearbox, engine and clutch were contained in special castings, and final drive was by a shaft mounted in a swing frame with adjustable suspension. Aluminium <b>leg</b> <b>shields</b> were designed to keep the rain off, and footboards gave it a scooter feel.|$|R
50|$|When the P 250 came on {{the market}} in 1934, Moto Guzzi also built a Triporteur based on this model, which had the 232 cc engine. Technically, there was no {{difference}} with the other models. The front was P 250, the back had a trailer with leaf springs. The prototype P 250 could also be provided with a closed container to which a canvas roof for the driver was confirmed. In addition, that could be protected by a touring windscreen, a canvas cover and <b>leg</b> <b>shields,</b> but although there is still development work was done in 1935, it never came to production.|$|R
50|$|Black Knight and Black Prince {{versions}} were innovative {{in using}} full enclosure and weather protection, with glass fibre panels that included <b>leg</b> <b>shields</b> and a handlebar fairing. This {{was not about}} streamlining for speed, as the fairings reduced top speed by 10 mph, although the Vincent was already powerful enough for riders of the day - it was instead {{about the idea that}} the rider could travel to work in a suit rather than full motorcycle kit. Care was taken to ensure that the engine was still easily accessible for general maintenance, and the rear enclosure was hinged to provide access to the rear wheel and drive chain.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the race}} {{to be the first}} person on the moon {{gathered}} pace, Innocenti's new model was launched, the Luna range (Luna meaning [...] "moon", in Italian). The machines looked very advanced for their day, reverting to the open frame style of the much admired [...] "D" [...] types, and although sales were slow to start with, racing success from grass-tracking to circuit-racing soon made them a sales success. Designed by Bertone Innocenti wanted a small frame and engine Lambretta that could be sold alongside the larger models. The frame had a tubular-steel front end, with bolt-on <b>leg</b> <b>shields,</b> and a monocoque pressed-steel rear frame.|$|R
5000|$|The {{number of}} scooter {{manufacturers}} and designs increased after World War I. The Skootamota, the Kenilworth, and the Reynolds Runabout debuted in 1919, with Gloucestershire Aircraft Company following with its Unibus in 1920. [...] The Skootamota was noted for being practical, popular, and economical, the Kenilworth for its electric lights, and the Reynolds Runabout for its advanced specifications, including front suspension, a two-speed gearbox, <b>leg</b> <b>shields,</b> and a seat sprung with leaf springs and coil springs. [...] The Unibus {{also had a}} two-speed gearbox, {{but it is more}} notable for its full bodywork, similar to that which would appear of second- and third-generation scooters.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} Čezeta is unique amongst scooters. It is unusually long for a two-wheeled vehicle at 2 metres and has a distinctive torpedo-shaped body with full length running boards and a long seat that lifted to reveal a substantial luggage compartment, using space that in most scooters is occupied by the fuel tank. This made the Čezeta ideal for two people and popular with young Czechs and their lovers. The front mudguard is fixed to the body and fully streamlined into the <b>leg</b> <b>shields.</b> The fuel tank is positioned above the front wheel, with the headlight fitted into a recess and a luggage rack on the flat top surface.|$|R
50|$|Many cutdowns have unneeded parts {{removed to}} improve power-to-weight ratio. Typically, the fenders, <b>leg</b> <b>shields,</b> floors, tail section and cowls are removed. Cutting away body parts {{is the easiest}} with Lambretta scooters, because they are built on a tubular frame, {{which means that the}} body parts do not have a {{structural}} role. Vespa scooters, on the other hand, are usually built with a unibody design, so the body panels give the bike its structure. This means that when Vespas are cut down, they cannot be made as bare-bones as a Lambretta. The body panels of a Vespa are modified by slimming them down or giving them a different shape, {{in such a way that}} the structural soundness of the bike is not compromised.|$|R
50|$|Falling {{sales of}} the Series C Vincent {{motorcycles}} during 1952 and 1953 was partly attributed to dated styling, so Phil Vincent sought to update the range and development began what were to become the Series D machines. The main change was innovative full enclosure and weather protection, with glass fibre panels that included <b>leg</b> <b>shields</b> and a handlebar fairing. This was not about streamlining for speed, as the Vincent was already powerful enough for riders of the day - it was instead {{about the idea that}} the rider could travel to work in a suit rather than full motorcycle kit. Care was taken to ensure that the engines were still easily accessible for general maintenance and the rear enclosure was hinged providing access to the rear wheel and drive chain.|$|R
50|$|The 2009 X-City 125/250 {{received}} an height adjustable windshield (four positions) and it now includes the rear carrier base. Both are welcome additions, especially the adjustable windshield {{is very good}} for taller drivers above 6.06 ft or 1,85 m, and the rear carrier base was also a very good addition, since most X-City scooters {{make use of the}} rear carrier in order to have enough space to store two full size helmets. The carrier base costs €140. The rear carrier, which still has to be bought separately (not in the Netherlands, where it is fitted as a standard accessory) costs another €140. Yamaha offers several accessories, including <b>leg</b> <b>shields</b> (€133) that protect against rain and wind at higher speed, as well as a taller windshield (€127) that includes protection for the hands.|$|R
50|$|The larvae are {{distinct}} by their coloration. Early instars are yellowish-green with black <b>legs,</b> head, prothoracic <b>shield,</b> and anal shield. The later instars are bright orange {{with the same}} contrasting dark sclerotization and with sparse moderately long pale setae. Last instar larvae are 19-26 mm in length with a yellow to dark yellowish-green abdomen. The head, prothoracic <b>shield,</b> thoracic <b>legs,</b> and anal <b>shield</b> are dark brown to black. An anal comb is absent. Larvae of Archips rileyana {{are very similar to}} those of A. cerasivorana.|$|R
50|$|Starting {{with the}} Model C Lambretta frames {{would be made}} of tube. The engine was once again a 123cc {{air-cooled}} engine but the block was this time was integrated to the frame with the spring suspension. The same carburetor, a Dell'Orto MA16, was used on the Model C as on the previous bikes. A 3 speed gearbox was also used as with the other models but the frame was made of {{a single piece of}} tube. The Model C had drum brakes, Front and Rear, and the head light was mounted on the front o the frame below the handlebars and the rear light was smaller and placed above the number plate. The Model C came with many more options than previous versions including rear seat, bolt on <b>leg</b> <b>shields,</b> a horn cover, speedometer, floor mats and a spear wheel. It came in 4 different colours, Beige, Green, Grey and Red.|$|R
5000|$|The Dingotre {{appeared}} in 1965 and was like AIACE intended for light transport. However, {{he had a}} big advantage: the 50 cc engine had no driver license required. The engine of the Moto Guzzi Dingo was built under the driver's seat. That engine to be equipped with forced air cooling [...] The Dingotre had no cabin, but a few large <b>leg</b> <b>shields</b> so that the front edge of a scooter seemed. There was a thick tube and chassis used. There was a large foot pedal, but the three gears were manual. At the front was a telescopic fork, the rear wheels were small leaf springs suspension. As the product was light, had the chain drive to the rear wheels. A reverse gear was not there. The Dingotre remained in production until 1968 and was succeeded by the Furghino. The Dingotre cost 151,000 lire without building and 210 500 complete.|$|R
25|$|After the war {{production}} restarted {{with the}} 532cc Standard Tourer and in 1922 Scott introduced the Squirrel, its first sporting model {{to be offered}} to the general public. This had a slightly smaller 486cc engine to bring it within the 500cc competition limit but, with aluminium pistons and careful preparation, it produced more power. In addition, many heavy accessories such as foot boards and <b>leg</b> <b>shields</b> which had been fitted to the touring models were dispensed with, making it a very light and competitive motorcycle. It {{was followed by the}} Super Squirrel, with a further revised engine of 498cc or 596cc, which was the mainstay of production in the mid-1920s. Although they never regained their pre-war form, Scotts continued to compete successfully in sporting events scoring a 3-4 in the 1922 TT and a third in 1924. A three-speed gearbox with conventional clutch was offered from 1923 and in this form the machine had some success as a trials motorcycle.|$|R

60|$|The cowboys {{admitted}} some of Belding's {{claims for}} Diablo, but they gave loyal and unshakable allegiance to Blanco Sol. As for Dick, {{he had to}} fight himself {{to keep out of}} arguments, for he sometimes imagined he was unreasonable about the horse. Though he could not understand himself, he knew he loved Sol as a man loved a friend, a brother. Free of heavy saddle and the clumsy <b>leg</b> <b>shields,</b> Blanco Sol was somehow all-satisfying to the eyes of the rangers. As long and big as Diablo was, Sol was longer and bigger. Also, he was higher, more powerful. He looked more a thing for action--speedier. At a distance the honorable scars and lumps that marred his muscular legs were not visible. He grazed aloof from the others, and did not cavort nor prance; but when he lifted his head to whistle, how wild he appeared, and proud and splendid! The dazzling whiteness of the desert sun shone from his coat; he had the fire and spirit of the desert in his noble head, its strength and power in his gigantic frame.|$|R
2500|$|Building the Canadian <b>Shield</b> <b>leg</b> {{required}} continual blasting. For one [...] stretch, {{the construction}} crew drilled [...] holes into the rock, three abreast, at 56-centimetre intervals. Dynamite broke up other stretches, [...] at a time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{national}} emblem of Indonesia is called Garuda Pancasila. The {{main part of}} Indonesian {{national emblem}} is the Garuda with a heraldic shield on its chest and a scroll gripped by its <b>legs.</b> The <b>shield's</b> five emblems represent Pancasila, the five principles of Indonesia's national ideology. The Garuda claws gripping a white ribbon scroll inscribed with the national motto Bhinneka Tunggal Ika written in black text, which can be loosely translated as [...] "Unity in Diversity". Garuda Pancasila was designed by Sultan Hamid II from Pontianak, supervised by Sukarno, and was adopted as the national emblem on 11 February 1950.|$|R
500|$|The Honda Juno {{had been}} the first scooter to use {{polyester}} resin, or fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP), bodywork, and even though production of the Juno had stopped in 1954 as a result of Honda Motor's financial and labor problems at the time, Fujisawa continued to encourage research in polyester resin casting techniques, and these efforts bore fruit for the Super Cub. The new motorcycle's fairing would be polyethylene, the most widely used plastic, which reduced weight over FRP, but Honda's supplier had never made such a large die cast before, so the die had to be provided by Honda. The Super Cub was the first motorcycle ever to use a plastic fairing. Motorcycling historian Clement Salvadori wrote that the plastic front fender and <b>leg</b> <b>shields</b> were, [...] "perhaps the Cub's greatest contribution; plastic did the job just as well as metal at considerably lower cost." [...] The technology developed in the Isle of Man TT racing program was equally vital to the new lightweight motorcycle, making possible [...] from a 50cc four-stroke Honda engine, where the first engine the company built a decade earlier, a [...] "fairly exact copy" [...] of the 50cc two stroke war-surplus Tohatsu engine Honda had been selling as motorized bicycle auxiliary engine, had only a [...] output. Honda's first four stroke, the 1951 E-type, had just a little more power than the Super Cub, , [...] with nearly triple the displacement, [...]|$|R

It has wings, but mainly jumps with its back <b>legs.</b> A <b>shield,</b> called pronotum, {{is located at}} the front segment of the thorax. The last section of the leg has four segments and the antennae has more than seven segments. The joint between leg and foot (tarsi) has 11 segments, with spiracles on the first eight. A. frater is abundant from mid August to early December. Their diet consists of a diversity of food, although they prefer green plants. There has been continuous usage of ULV insecticides and bran baits on the grasshopper.|$|R
5000|$|Leonidas is a {{sculpture}} of hoplite made of Parian marble in 480-470 BC and unearthed in 1926. The sculpture was dubbed [...] "Leonidas" [...] {{by a local}} Greek workman after its discovery, in reference to Spartan king Leonidas I. It was found southwest of peribolos of the sanctuary of Athena Chalkioikos on the Acropolis of Sparta. The sculpture is housed in the Archaeological Museum of Sparta which acquired it from the British School at Athens in 1926. The sculpture features a Corinthian helmet with ram-shaped cheek pieces. While most of the plume is a restoration, fragments of a <b>leg,</b> foot, <b>shield</b> and helmet were also found nearby.|$|R
