40|$|This review {{concerns}} potential {{traffic safety}} {{effects from the}} introduction of <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> trucks than those currently allowed in Sweden. For this purpose, a summary of results from accident studies, literature summaries and in-depth studies of fatal accidents involving heavy trucks {{done in the past}} few years was made. In addition, a focus group study with truck drivers was conducted and results from a parallel VTI study concerning overtaking of longer trucks have also been included in order to give an overall picture of the possible traffic safety effects associated with the introduction of <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> trucks in Sweden. Following are some of the recommendations, based on the aspects that have been addressed in this report: <b>Longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>vehicles</b> should mainly operate on main roads where it is possible to overtake <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> without fear of oncoming traffic. <b>Longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>vehicles</b> should operate as little as possible in urban areas. 9 ̆ 5 <b>Longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>vehicles</b> shall be constructed for good stability, and be equipped with Electronic Brake System (EBS). 9 ̆ 5 <b>Longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>vehicles</b> puts greater demand on tires, brakes and especially maintenance and inspection. 9 ̆ 5 Driver fatigue is a cause of an essential part of single-vehicle accidents with <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Drive <b>and</b> rest times may be harder to keep with the extra-long vehicles if rest areas, which are already today overcrowded along certain roads, are not extended. 9 ̆ 5 The signs of the transition distance on 2 + 1 roads should be reviewed to possibly reduce the risk of dangerous situations and emergencies caused by overtaking of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles.</b> 9 ̆ 5 Additional field studies on two-lane roads are necessary to determine whether there is a higher risk to overtake a 30 m long vehicle compared to overtaking a conventional heavy truck...|$|R

40|$|At {{this moment}} the total {{allowable}} length of an articulated vehicle in The Netherlands is 18. 35 meter and its total weight is 50 ton. Several Dutch transportation organisations requested {{a pilot project}} with <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>vehicles</b> for <b>heavy</b> goods transpotation. Because of the environmental benefits to society, the Ministry of Transport was prepared to consider such a pilot project. The Ministry decided that, before a decision could be made several questions had to be answered, such as about legal aspects in relation to European laws, and about infrastructure, environment, economics and road safety. It was also decided to make an inventory of such questions together with the branch organisations. Information {{to answer these questions}} was gathered, also in close collaboration with the branch organisations, by studying literature, interviewing key persons in countries where <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>vehicles</b> are operating at the moment, and by using existing mathematical models. The TNO Road-Vehicles Research Institute has investigated the safety aspects. The vehicle stability is one of these aspects and many publications have been made on this item. Other items concerning safety are: overview {{on the right side of}} the vehicle combination in a right turn; crosswind disturbance; overtake manoeuvres by other road users on single carriage ways; traffic flow; crash behaviour. The main questions concerning the economical, infrastructure, environmental and legal aspects will be described in broad outline, whereas the safety aspects will be described in more detail. This is followed by the methods by which the answers were collected and by a description of the results. On the bases of this information an advice to the Minister was formulated to conduct a pilot project under restricted conditions. Finally, the suggested pilot project restrictions will be described...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model for}} analyzing the potential of <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>vehicles</b> (LHVs) re-lated to pre- and post-haulage in the intermodal rail-road transport chain (IRT). The paper con-siders the combined economic and emission costs among three different transport networks in-cluding intermodal rail-road transport with current Swedish regulatory framework for trucks, in-termodal rail-road transport with LHVs, and direct-road transport. The objective is to analyse the potential of high-capacity transport associated with pre- and post-haulage for enhancing the competitiveness of intermodal transport from a full-costs perspective. The model developed is applied to a Swedish context and case study. Research findings reveal that the break-even of the IRT compared to the direct road transport could be significantly lowered, which suggests the LHVs contribute to exploring the market of IRT over smaller flows...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the frame}} of the Logistics Action Plan, the European Commission is {{analysing}} the impacts of a potential introduction across the EU of <b>Longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>Heavier</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (LHVs), i. e. vehicles measuring up to 25. 25 m and weighting up to 60 tons. Such vehicles are expected to improve the efficiency of the road freight sector but their impacts on the environment, infrastructure and safety need to be analysed in more depth. The present study aims at providing an overview of the technical aspects associated with LHVs regarding energy efficiency, infrastructure (road wear and bridges) and safety issues. This is carried out at vehicle level based on a comparison with standard 40 t <b>heavy</b> duty <b>vehicles</b> (HDVs). Some technologies that can potentially improve the performance and reduce the damage caused by LHVs are described and issues that require further and detailed research are also identified.

40|$|Due to {{economic}} development, {{it is expected}} that the transport demand will increase by over 50 % between 2000 and 2020. Inland freight transport movements in the European Union largely depend on road transport. The continuing expansion of freight transport by road calls for innovative solutions. Dutch companies and the government are constantly looking for new opportunities to make road transportation as efficient, sustainable and safe as possible. One of the most practical opportunities is to increase the loading capacity of trucks by using <b>Longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>Heavier</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (LHVs). LHV combinations have a maximum train weight of 60 tonnes and a maximum length of 25, 25 metres. They can transport up to 57 % more (in volume) than a regular truck combination. Despite {{the fact that there are}} currently over 700 LHV combinations in use in the Netherlands, only a limited number of these LHV combinations are used to transport building materials, while building materials are the most transported cargo in the Netherlands. The purpose of this research is to investigate if <b>Longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>Heavier</b> <b>Vehicles</b> can be used to transport building materials in the Netherlands. The research shows that LHVs are particularly increase the transport efficiency of volume-constrained and prefabricated building materials. Transporting weigh-constrained building materials with LHVs is not likely because the small increase in loading (weight) capacity of an LHV compared to a standard truck does not result in transport efficiency. The logistics network between manufacturers and wholesalers/DIY stores is, until now, most suitable for these transports due to their accessibility. However, upcoming building transport development like the use of consolidation centres create further opportunities for the implementation of LHVs in the building industry network. Because the transport of building materials relies heavily on road transport, and will do so also in the years to come, the use of LHVs can create transport efficiencies resulting in savings in fuel, emissions, transport costs and the number of vehicles on the road...|$|R
40|$|The {{volume of}} goods transported {{as well as}} the number of {{commercial}} vehicles in Europe has increased substantially over the past decade. The sixteen years old European directive on vehicle weights and dimensions does not fully reflect on these circumstances and allows commercial vehicles up to 18. 75 m of length and weight of 44 t for international transport. As the Dutch experience reveals, the legalization of <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>vehicles</b> (LHV) on highways makes transportation of goods more efficient, sustainable and is applicable even in highly populated regions. This paper is benchmarking the performance of all currently used Dutch LHV combinations, two potential LHV concepts satisfying the logistic needs, and conventional European combinations using the Australian performance based approach. Furthermore it discusses applicability of performance based standards to Europe as an alternative to current prescriptive legislation and shows that performance of LHV’s can differ very much...|$|R
40|$|Intermodal {{rail-road}} transport, {{known as}} a possible solution for developing a sustainable and efficient transport system, has received great concerns recently. This thesis develops a model for analyzing the cost and environmental potential of <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>vehicles</b> (LHVs) related to pre- and post-haulage in rail-road intermodal transport chain. This thesis compares economic, emission, and total costs between three different transport networks including intermodal rail-road transport with current Swedish trucks, intermodal rail-road transport with LHVs, and the unimodal road transport. Contribution of the LHVs to cost efficiency of intermodal network will be identified by the traffic volume break-even between the three transport networks. The objective is to give a solution for enhancing the competitiveness of intermodal transport from a full costs perspective. By deducting an empirical diagram, this thesis will take a Swedish project as the case for calculation. The case will present three scenarios respectively, representing the three transport networks mentioned above. Msc in Logistics and Transport managemen...|$|R
40|$|This paper applies an {{integrated}} modeling {{approach to the}} case of Spain; the approach is based on a random utility-based multiregional input-output model and a road transport network model for assessing the effect of introducing <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>vehicles</b> (LHVs) on the regional consumer price index (CPI) and on the transportation system. The approach strongly supports the concept that changes in transport costs derived from the LHV allowance as well as the economic structure of regions have direct and indirect effects on the economy and on the transportation system. Results show that the introduction of LHVs might reduce prices paid by consumers for a representative basket of goods and services in the regions of Spain and would also lead to a reduction in the regional CPI. In addition, the magnitude and extent of changes in the transportation system are estimated by using the commodity-based structure of the approach to identify the effect of traffic changes on traffic flows and on pollutant emissions over the whole network...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} on introducing <b>Longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>Heavier</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (LHVs) on {{the road}} freight transport demand is performed in this paper by applying an integrated modeling approach composed of a Random Utility-Based Multiregional Input-Output model (RUBMRIO) and a road transport network model. The approach strongly supports the concept that changes in transport costs derived from the LHVs allowance {{as well as the}} economic structure of regions have both direct and indirect effects {{on the road}} freight transport system. In addition, we estimate the magnitude and extent of demand changes in the road freight transportation system by using the commodity-based structure of the approach to identify the effect on traffic flows and on pollutant emissions over the whole network of Spain by considering a sensitivity analysis of the main parameters which determine the share of Heavy-Goods Vehicles (HGVs) and LHVs. The results show that the introduction of LHVs will strengthen the competitiveness of the road haulage sector by reducing costs, emissions, and the total freight vehicles required...|$|R

40|$|<b>Longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>Heavier</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (LHVs) could {{enhance the}} {{competitiveness}} of countries due to savings in transportation costs.

In this paper, we develop a new methodology based on a Random Utility-Based Multiregional Input–output Model and a road transport network model {{to assess the impact of}} allowing LHVs. We applied it to the case of Spain, and we found that allowing LHVs would produce both direct and indirect effects. Real GDP and employment are expected to grow in all the regions, but some of them —the most competitive, most peripheral, and most transport-intensive— will benefit much more than other regions. We also found that the measure would lead to a reduction of vehicles in the network and a reduction of emissions too. The approach designed in this paper provides broad guidance to national governments and other transport-related parties to quantify the impacts of transport policies such as thi...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission is {{considering}} {{the implications of}} allowing the use of LHVs, vehicles measuring up to 25. 25 m and weighing up to 60 tons, {{for the whole of}} the European Union transport system. The introduction of such trucks on the European road network will generate environmental impacts, safety and infrastructure costs. The present study aims at carrying out an uncertainty analysis of the technical and economic aspects of LHVs based on assumptions and results ranges taken from recent literature. The results suggest that the potential impacts of the introduction of LHVs at EU level can be positive –under certain conditions- in both economic and environmental terms. The increased payloads per vehicle are expected to reduce transport costs and lead to significant savings for operators, industry and consumers. Since fewer trucks would be required to transport the same volume of trade, the environmental and other external costs of freight transport would also be lower, even though an individual LHV consumes and pollutes more than a conventional truck. An analysis of the potential benefits to the economy and the society as a whole has been carried out. <b>Longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>vehicles,</b> LHV, transport...|$|R

30|$|The role of pre- and post-haulage {{covered by}} road in {{combined}} transport is relevant, {{as pointed out}} in the previous sections, both in terms of internal and external costs. Ye et al. [25] analysed the potential of <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>vehicles,</b> related, for instance, to pre- and post-haulage. They showed that these types of trucks contribute to improving intermodal transport efficiency, thanks to internal and external cost formulas, in which volume variables were considered. Other solutions to improve the efficiency of road drayage could be in terms of power supply. A number of manufacturers are currently proposing new solutions for the power supply of trucks, such as electric vehicles for lower classes of weight (up to roughly 5 – 7.5 tons), hybrid vehicles and CNG or LNG engines for higher weights. These alternatives, in particular the hybrid or electric ones, are usually compatible with the distances covered during pre- and post-haulage, considering the location of charging stations in the terminals. The positive effects of replacing traditional engines are mainly reflected on the external costs, due to the reduction in emissions, and on the internal costs, in terms of consumption. Furthermore, the final section of rail-road combined transport usually takes place on urban routes, which are subject to environmental restrictions in many cities.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we carry out}} a {{thorough}} review of the current research related to the benefits and costs arising from the implementation of <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>vehicles</b> (LHVs). From this review we concluded that despite the many studies available, little {{has been said about}} the sensitivity of the benefits and costs to the ultimate performance of the key variables related to the evolution of the economy, road transport performance, safety, and so on. In order to fill this gap, we have designed a sensitivity approach based on a cost benefit analysis tool to determine which variables demonstrate the greatest influence on the benefits and costs stemming from the implementation of LHVs. In order to test the methodology, we have used it in an analysis of the Spanish trunk network. The results show that the benefits of LHVs for society are significant. Even in the least favorable scenario, the economic benefits are greater than € 3500 million over 15 years, and the environment enhanced as well, for CO 2 emissions are reduced by 2 Million tonnes. Overall we noted how the results are not very sensitive to the evolution of key variables in determining the final outcome. However, we found that the variables that have the greatest affect on the final benefit, such as traffic growth and social discount rate, depend basically on the performance of the overall economy. Moreover, the private cost for haulers seems to be more important in determining the final benefit than externality cost...|$|R
40|$|VTI has {{previously}} shown {{that there are}} socio-economic benefits of using <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> road <b>vehicles</b> {{than the rest of}} the EU, i. e. 25. 25 metres and 60 tons are permitted. The aim of the Co-modality project is to investigate the consequences of using even <b>longer</b> and/or <b>heavier</b> road <b>and</b> railway <b>vehicles.</b> This first subproject aims to answer which dimensions and weight limits with regards to road and railway vehicles that the Co-modality project should investigate further as well as the effects. A literature review has been conducted and to capture the views of Swedish stakeholders and transportation experts, a questionnaire survey was conducted. The respondents were invited to a hearing, too. The reason for the survey was to establish which road and railway vehicles would be in demand year 2030. The results show that no extreme changes are expected and that volume capacity was requested to a further extent than weight. For road vehicles, it is mainly a question of continuing to build on the European Modular System that combines different standardised load carriers. It allows member states to have different dimensions to those in other EU countries. For railway vehicles the demand is mainly for longer trains, but also heavier. Road safety, infrastructure, congestion, environment and transportation economy are the aspects that we identified as relevant for <b>longer</b> and/or <b>heavier</b> road <b>and</b> railway <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The Swedish {{government}} {{is likely to}} implement <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> road freight <b>vehicles,</b> so-called high-capacity vehicles (HCVs), in the near future. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analysis the expected effects on the whole transport system regarding tonne-kilometres, vehicle-kilometres on road, CO 2 and socio-economics with three possible implementation strategies (HCVs on all roads, a designated road network and a designated road network with a kilometre-based truck charge) and two vehicle types (74 t/ 25. 25 m and 74 t/ 34 m). Design/methodology/approach: Calculations are based on two well-established scenarios for transport development in Sweden. Changes per tonne-kilometre are modelled for ten product groups with considerations taken to their transport networks. Socio-economic effects are analysed using the net present value rating method over a 40 -year period. Findings: The study shows the increase in demand for transport and the modal shift, from rail and sea to road, in terms of tonne-kilometres, vehicle-kilometres and CO 2 emissions for three implementation strategies of HCVs in two scenarios. All implementation strategies show a positive social net-benefit with the introduction of HCVs. Research limitations/implications: The results reveal potential benefits to the implementation of HCVs. The results are limited by possible over/under-estimations of effects considered in the calculations, due to uncertainties and assumptions. Practical implications: The results highlight expected levels of modal shift and induced transport for different HCV implementation strategies and how they depend on transport and climate policies and the expected growth of tonne-kilometres. Originality/value: The calculations consider socio-economic effects, particularly from increased CO 2 emissions due to modal shift and induced traffic, which is lacking in previous studies. To balance conflicting economic and environmental goals, the findings indicate that the implementation of HCVs could be accompanied by other policy measures. The findings are based on the Swedish context, but the model can be adapted to other countries or regions and to study other freight transport reforms...|$|R
