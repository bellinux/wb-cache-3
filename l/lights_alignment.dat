30|$|Structural {{coloring}} has limitations such as static color, limited-scale fabrication and low throughput. Structural filters produce {{colors that}} stay mostly static, so {{the search for}} a method to tune them is currently an important research topic. Structural color filters that can be tuned by adjusting external factors can manipulate colors by controlling factors such as polarization angle of incident <b>light,</b> <b>alignment</b> of liquid crystals (LCs) [32 – 35], mechanical strain [36 – 39] and chemical state [40 – 43]. In this review, we summarize research on plasmonic color filtering, with a brief explanation of its working principle. We also introduce recent developments in tunable color filtering and large-scale color filtering, which may lead to real-world application.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Information {{integration}} {{is the focus}} of different research domains for several years. With the emergence of the Internet as a very large database, this topic became of extreme relevance for a larger audience, seeking for mechanisms to align information from different data sources according to semantic needs and constraints. The classical integration approaches do not satisfy new operational requirements, thus new strategies should be proposed and developed. We suggest the adoption of a <b>light</b> <b>alignment</b> mechanism without merging data source. The alignment process occurs at ontological level, setting the components and transformation functions necessary to translate data from source to the target. Establishing the alignment process at ontological level allows the system to reason about the semantic embodied in the information and thus enhance the alignment results, according to both the source and target specifications. The resulting specifications are then applied in the transformation procedure, executed independently of data source entities...|$|R

A critical literature review was augmented by design analysis and field experience. This paper documents the resulting critical thematic investigations of the Parthenon, the Acropolis and the New Museum through siting, materiality and <b>light,</b> <b>alignment,</b> visual connections, through exploitation of the unique Attic light, orchestrated movement and considered juxtapositions.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} studies {{related to}} track-based alignment {{for the future}} CMS experiment at CERN. Excellent geometric alignment is crucial to fully benefit from the outstanding resolution of individual sensors. The large number of sensors makes it difficult in CMS to utilize computationally demanding alignment algorithms. A computationally <b>light</b> <b>alignment</b> algorithm, called the Hits and Impact Points algorithm (HIP), is developed and studied. It is based on minimization of the hit residuals. It {{can be applied to}} individual sensors or to composite objects. All six alignment parameters (three translations and three rotations), or their subgroup can be considered. The algorithm is expected to be particularly suitable for the alignment of the innermost part of CMS, the pixel detector, during its early operation, but can be easily utilized to align other parts of CMS also. The HIP algorithm is applied to simulated CMS data and real data measured with a test-beam setup. The simulation studies demonstrate that the algorithm is a promising candidate for the alignment of the pixel detector. The test-beam study shows that the use of the algorithm significantly improves the data measured with genuine CMS hardware. The positioning uncertainties of different parts of CMS have also been systematically estimated. Ready-made scenarios corresponding to these uncertainties have been implemented in the CMS reconstruction software ORCA. These scenarios have been used in the alignment studies. They have also been widely used for more realistic misalignment simulation in the physics performance studies of the CMS collaboration. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Optical {{transceiver}} module {{which includes the}} transmitter and receiver {{plays a key role}} in the optical communication network. The data transfer speed will be dominated by the {{transceiver module}}. This paper proposed a novel transceiver packaging training course for the college and graduate students. Through the integration of the theory introduction and the experiment operation, the key technology of the module packaging can be taught to the students. Generally, an optical transceiver includes a top-cover, box, component submount, invar plate, invar substrate, U-channel, fiber, ferrule, laser diode, and thermal electric cooler (TEC). The purpose of this course is to show and teach how to assemble all the above components inside the box quickly, precisely, and stable with the various packaging technology. A novel structure is introduced here to separate the packaging technology into two parts so the course training can be clearer and easier. One is the mounting of components because every component used in the module has to be precisely positioned and fixed at the right place to ensure the module performance. Positioning control and image inspection technology is key technology in this part. And another part would be the <b>light</b> <b>alignment</b> between the laser diode and the fiber. The light coupling efficiency decides the final performance of the module. Various alignment structure and method will be introduced here. All experiments will accompany with a brief theory and application instruction in the classes, so the students can have a basic understanding to the purpose, theory basics, and application field of the experiments. ...|$|R
