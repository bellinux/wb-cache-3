40|$|The {{quantity}} of <b>loading</b> <b>losses,</b> {{which are the}} primary source of evaporative emissions from tank cars and trucks was analyzed in this paper. <b>Loading</b> <b>losses</b> occur as organic vapors in "empty" cargo tanks are displaced to the atmosphere by the liquid being loaded into the tanks. Emissions from loading petroleum liquid were estimated using three methods: the API (American Petroleum Institute) method, the VDI (Verein Deutscher Ingenieure -Association of German Engineers) method and the Yugoslav Standard JUS B. HO. 531 method. The mass of evaporative <b>losses</b> from <b>loading</b> operations {{is a function of the}} following parameters: the method of loading the cargo, the physical and chemical characteristics of the cargo and the ambient temperature during <b>loading.</b> Evaporation <b>losses</b> from the <b>loading</b> of motor gasoline (MB- 95, BMB- 95, MB- 98 and MB- 86) and diesel fuels (D- 2, Euro D- 2) were calculated. Losses on a monthly and annual basis were presented for an assumed amount of loaded cargo. It was estimated that the highest <b>loading</b> <b>losses</b> occur in the summer period because of high ambient daily temperatures and in the period of higher transporting levels. It should be pointed out that the <b>loading</b> <b>losses</b> of diesel fuel calculated using an empirical coefficient according to JUS B. HO. 531 are significantly higher in comparison with the <b>loading</b> <b>losses</b> calculated using emission factors from the EPA and the VDI method. The gasoline <b>loading</b> <b>losses</b> calculated using emission factors derived from the three methods are similar...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{procedure is}} {{based on the fact that}} total transformer losses (PLL 1,n), determined by short circuit test, can be separated into two components: the eddy current losses in the windings (PEC 1,n) and stray flux losses (PSL 1,n) in iron parts of construction as well as in the transformer tank walls. The total additional <b>load</b> <b>losses,</b> PLLd 1 and PLLdh, are determined by short circuit test results, conducted at rated frequency (f 1) and at increased harmonic frequency (fh=h*f 1). Using so obtained total additional <b>load</b> <b>losses,</b> PLLd 1 and PLLdh, which can be expressed in the form PLLdh=PEC 1,n*h 2 + PSL 1,n*h, the corresponding rate additional <b>load</b> <b>losses</b> values PEC 1,n and PSL 1,n are derived. At the end, for given load with predefined high harmonics content, (Ih/I 1 n), relative to rated current, the total additional <b>load</b> <b>losses</b> value ΣPLLdh > PLLd 1, is found. In such a way all harmonics up to hmax are taken into account...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the design}} {{elements}} of premium motors is the reduction of heat losses due to the electrical resistance of conductors. To improve the electrical energy efficiency of induction-type motors, <b>load</b> <b>loss</b> can be reduced by increasing the cross section of copper coils. A high efficiency motor will usually have 20% more copper in the stator winding than its standard counterpart.|$|E
50|$|The main {{application}} of AMTs are the grid distribution transformers rated at about 50-1000 kVA. These transformers typically run 24 {{hours a day}} and at a low load factor (average load divided by nominal load). The no <b>load</b> <b>loss</b> of these transforms makes up {{a significant part of the}} loss of the whole distribution net. Amorphous iron is also used in specialized electric motors that operate at high frequencies of perhaps 350 Hz or more.|$|E
50|$|Copper loss is {{the term}} often given to heat {{produced}} by electrical currents in the conductors of transformer windings, or other electrical devices. Copper losses are an undesirable transfer of energy, as are core losses, which result from induced currents in adjacent components. The term is applied {{regardless of whether the}} windings are made of copper or another conductor, such as aluminium. Hence the term winding loss is often preferred. The term <b>load</b> <b>loss</b> is closely related but not identical, since an unloaded transformer will have some winding loss.|$|E
30|$|From Table  5, it can {{be found}} that the higher of the final <b>load</b> <b>losses,</b> the higher of {{intermediate}} amount of the studied layer.|$|R

3000|$|... 8 in IEEE- 39 test system, {{if using}} under {{specific}} voltage load shedding strategy, the <b>load</b> <b>losses</b> will be 1138.2  MW, while {{when using the}} proposed load shedding strategy, the <b>load</b> <b>losses</b> are only 446.5  MW. Besides, the stability of power system is also improved. For the previous example, the voltage variance after shedding load is {{used to evaluate the}} system stability, and the value when using the proposed strategy is only 10 % of the value when using under specific voltage load shedding strategy.|$|R
50|$|In a {{transformer}} the no <b>load</b> <b>loss</b> {{is dominated by}} the core loss. With an amorphous core, this can be 70-80% lower than with traditional crystalline materials.The loss under heavy load {{is dominated by the}} resistance of the copper windings and thus called copper loss. Here the lower saturation magnetization of amorphous cores tend to result in a lower efficiency at full load. Using more copper and core material it is possible to compensate for this. So high efficiency AMTs can be more efficient at low and high load, though at a larger size. The more expensive amorphous core material, the more difficult handling and the need for more copper windings make an AMT more expensive than a traditional transformer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Load</b> <b>loss</b> {{is usually}} a {{function}} of molecular weight. That is, lighter molecules tend to boil off in larger quantities at the processing temperatures. Loss is minimized industrially by spraying into taller towers. A larger volume of air has a lower average humidity as the process proceeds. By the osmosis principle, water will be encouraged by its difference in fugacities in the vapor and liquid phases to leave the micelles and enter the air. Therefore, the same percentage of water can be dried out of the particles at lower temperatures if larger towers are used. Alternatively, the slurry can be sprayed into a partial vacuum. Since the boiling point of a solvent is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the solvent {{is equal to the}} ambient pressure, reducing pressure in the tower has the effect of lowering the boiling point of the solvent.|$|E

40|$|With {{different}} purposeful measurements {{like for}} the stray <b>load</b> <b>losses</b> and the flux densities, on two low-voltage squirrel-cage rotor asynchronous generators for 1. 5 MW wind turbines with different types of the stator winding (litz and round wire), {{the sources of the}} losses and the causes for the winding overheating are localized and defined. Different measures to reduce the stray <b>load</b> <b>losses</b> due the skin effect in the stator of the round wire winding generator are successfully tested and implemented in the manufacturing process. Thanks to these proven techniques the round wire winding is competitive to other expensive winding types. Analytical models for the estimation of the stator stray <b>load</b> <b>losses</b> due to the skin effect for profile, litz and round wire winding are compared to the measurements. A survey on the cheap and simple methods to measure the stray <b>load</b> <b>losses</b> in squirrel-cage induction motors, apart from the standardized methods, results in three equivalent “no-load” methods, where no coupling and no dynamometer or torque-meter are needed. The strengths and weaknesses of the measurement methods were investigated and compared with the standardized input-output test (residual loss method) and the reverse rotation test (RRT) on 27 standard TEFC grid-operated cage induction motors (2 -, 4 - and 6 -pole) with the current design of six European manufacturers with the rated power of 0. 37 kW, 0. 55 kW, 1. 1 kW, 5. 5 kW, 11 kW and 315 kW. It was concluded, that it is a benefit to add the eh-star method into the next edition of the future IEC 60034 - 2 *), as it is cheap, yielding comparable results with the input-output test, and is fitting better the purpose than RRT, which is already included in the standards. The theoretical background and the measurement procedure for the eh-star method are described in detail. Some analytical calculations were done, showing that theoretical prediction of the stray <b>load</b> <b>losses</b> correlates with the design and the measurement results...|$|R
