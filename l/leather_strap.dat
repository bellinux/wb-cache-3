5|$|The seventh {{match was}} the main event from SmackDown, a Punjabi Prison match for the World Heavyweight Championship, where, Batista, defended the title against The Great Khali. In the match, two giant wooden cages {{surrounded}} the ring, and, to win, a competitor had to escape both structures. After both men prevented the other from escaping, Khali utilized a <b>leather</b> <b>strap</b> as a weapon. Batista later used the <b>leather</b> <b>strap</b> and attempted to climb over inner cage, but Khali stopped him and squeezed Batista's head with a Vise Grip. Khali then called for a door to be opened but Batista struck him with a low blow. The match ended when Khali had climbed over the inner cage and began climbing the outer cage. Batista then mounted the inner cage, jumped to the second cage and, overtaking Khali, climbed to the ground, thereby winning the match and retaining the title.|$|E
5|$|These early {{models were}} {{essentially}} standard pocket-watches fitted to a <b>leather</b> <b>strap,</b> {{but by the}} early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company, Dimier Frères & Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. In 1904, Alberto Santos-Dumont, an early aviator, asked his friend, a French watchmaker called Louis Cartier, to design a watch that could be useful during his flights.|$|E
5|$|Booker T and Sharmell {{versus the}} team of Robert Roode and Payton Banks in a Six Sides of Steel Intergender Tag Team Cage match was another highly {{promoted}} match heading into the event. This encounter was announced on the March 20 episode of Impact! by Cornette. The feud regarding this encounter began at Final Resolution, where Roode accidentally punched Booker T's real-life wife Sharmell, fracturing her jaw in the storyline and leaving her sidelined indefinitely. Booker T and Roode then fought at Against All Odds to a double count-out. At TNA's Destination X PPV event on March 9, 2008, Roode and Booker T fought in a Stand By Your Man Strap match, which Roode won. After the bout, Sharmell returned from injury attacking Roode and his manager Banks with a <b>leather</b> <b>strap.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes on a blanket. Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded <b>leather</b> <b>strap</b> from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E
5|$|The Crosby Garrett helmet is {{an almost}} {{complete}} example of a two-piece Roman cavalry helmet. The visor portrays {{the face of a}} youthful, clean-shaven male with curly hair. The headpiece is {{in the shape of a}} Phrygian cap, on the crest of which is a winged griffin that stands with one raised foot resting on an amphora. The visor was originally attached to the headpiece by means of a hinge; the iron hinge pin has not survived, but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue. The helmet would have been held in place using a <b>leather</b> <b>strap</b> attached from the wearer's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of the helmet, below the ear. Wear marks caused by opening and closing the visor are still visible, and at some point the helmet was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits. Only two other Roman helmets complete with visors have been found in Britain – the Newstead Helmet and Ribchester Helmet.|$|E

25|$|On 10 December 1941, Richter was hanged at Wandsworth Prison. A {{procedure}} that normally took around 15 seconds, took over 17 minutes. When Albert Pierrepoint, the executioner, entered Richter's cell to bind his wrists, Richter charged at the cell wall headfirst. After a struggle, Pierrepoint succeeded in binding Richter's wrists {{behind his back}} with a <b>leather</b> <b>strap,</b> but Richter's ferocious strength {{was so great that}} he split the <b>leather</b> <b>strap</b> and was free again. Four warders eventually subdued Richter and bundled him into the gallows chamber where a strap was fastened around his ankles, a hood placed over his head and the noose placed around his neck. Richter continued to fight and just as Pierrepoint pulled the lever that would open the trapdoors beneath Richter's feet, the condemned man jumped in the air. The noose slipped and almost came off Richter's head but caught under his nose. Richter had died instantly but not without a struggle.|$|E
25|$|Other accordions, {{such as the}} {{diatonic}} button accordion, {{have only}} a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) <b>leather</b> <b>strap</b> on the left-hand manual to keep the player's hand in position while drawing the bellows. There are also straps {{above and below the}} bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.|$|E
25|$|This {{developed}} into the Surge hanging milker. Prior to milking a cow, a large wide <b>leather</b> <b>strap</b> called a surcingle was put around the cow, across the cow's lower back. The milker device and collection tank hung underneath the cow from the strap. This innovation allowed the cow {{to move around}} naturally during the milking process {{rather than having to}} stand perfectly still over a bucket on the floor.|$|E

25|$|Amulets in general, {{were very}} popular. They were worn for many magical purposes. Health related amulets are {{classified}} as homeopoetic, phylactic and theophoric. Homeopoetic amulets portray an animal or part of an animal, from which the wearer hopes to gain positive attributes like strength or speed. Phylactic amulets protected against harmful gods and demons. The famous Eye of Horus was often used on a phylactic amulet. Theophoric amulets represented Egyptian gods; one represented the girdle of Isis and was intended to stem {{the flow of blood}} at miscarriage. They were often made of bone, hanging from a <b>leather</b> <b>strap.</b>|$|E
25|$|The stirrup {{was one of}} the {{milestones}} in saddle development. The first stirrup-like {{object was}} invented in India in the 2nd century BC, and consisted of a simple <b>leather</b> <b>strap</b> in which the rider's toe was placed. It offered very little support, however. The nomadic tribes in northern China are thought to have been the inventors of the modern stirrup, but the first dependable representation of a rider with paired stirrups was found in China in a Jin Dynasty tomb of about AD 302. The stirrup appeared to be in widespread use across China by 477 AD, and later spread to Europe. This invention gave great support for the rider, and was essential in later warfare.|$|E

25|$|At Fully Loaded, a First Blood {{match was}} signed with two stipulations. If Undertaker regained the title, Austin could never {{challenge}} for it again. If Austin was to retain, Vince McMahon {{would be forced}} to leave the WWF. Austin won by hitting The Undertaker with a television camera after an assist from X-Pac, thus retaining the title and forcing Vince out of the company. Meanwhile, The Acolytes defeated The Hardy Boyz and their manager Michael Hayes to regain the tag team titles and Triple H defeated The Rock in a <b>leather</b> <b>strap</b> match to become the number one contender for the WWF Championship. Two weeks later, the Acolytes would lose the tag team titles to X-Pac and Kane.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Berdella was intelligent, but {{a classic}} loner who rarely played outside his own home, and seldom had friends visit his home to socialize with him. He was also {{severely}} nearsighted (resulting in his {{being required to}} wear thick glasses {{from the age of}} five) and afflicted with a slight speech impediment. Furthermore, as a child, he would be diagnosed as suffering from a high blood pressure, for which he was prescribed several medications. In part because of this diagnosis, Berdella was largely unathletic, whereas his younger brother, Daniel (b. 1956), displayed an aptitude for various sports from an early age. As Berdella's father valued sports and physical education, he viewed his older son's lack of interest in sports as a sign of failure on Berdella's part, and would often compare him unfavorably with his younger brother. Occasionally, Berdella's father would also become physically and emotionally abusive against his children, and is known to have beaten them with a <b>leather</b> <b>strap.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two {{months after}} the murder of Steven Tuomi, Dahmer {{encountered}} a 14-year-old Native American male prostitute named James Doxtator; Dahmer lured the youth to his home with an offer of $50 to pose for nude pictures. At Dahmer's West Allis residence, the pair engaged in sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Doxtator and strangled {{him on the floor}} of the cellar. Dahmer left the body in the cellar for one week before dismembering it in much the same manner as he had with Tuomi. He placed all of Doxtator's remains (excluding the skull) in the trash. He boiled the skull, and initially retained it before pulverizing it. On March 24, 1988, Dahmer met a 22-year-old bisexual man named Richard Guerrero outside a gay bar called The Phoenix. Dahmer lured Guerrero to his grandmother's residence, although the incentive on this occasion was $50 to simply spend the remainder of the night with him; he then drugged Guerrero with sleeping pills and strangled him with a <b>leather</b> <b>strap,</b> with Dahmer then performing oral sex upon the corpse. Guerrero's body was dismembered within 24hours of his murder, with the remains again disposed of in the trash and the skull again retained before being pulverized several months later.|$|E

25|$|This {{investigation}} included {{over one}} hundred interviews of former students, family of former students, and former staff members of the school. The interviews confirmed {{that in addition to}} the implementation of the Individual Rating System, school administrators used corporal punishment as a tool to encourage obedience. The interviews revealed little disagreement about the way in which corporal punishment was administered. The former students were consistent in that punishment was administered by school administrators and adult staff witnesses in the building referred to as the White House. The former students were consistent in stating that a wooden paddle or <b>leather</b> <b>strap</b> was the implement used for administering punishment. The area of disagreement amongst former students was the number of spankings administered and their severity. Although some former students stated that they were “beaten” {{to the point that the}} skin of their buttocks blistered and bled profusely, there was little to no evidence of visible residual scarring. A secondary disagreement was the former students’ perceptions of the punishment process. Some former students stated that their spankings caused them no psychological harm and that they learned from their mistakes while others stated that, mentally, they suffered greatly as a result and still do so to this day.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match of}} the night {{featured}} CMLL's women's wrestling division as eight ladies competed for the La Copa 81 Aniversario ("81st Anniversary Cup") trophy in an elimination match. Dalys la Caribeña, {{one of the eight}} participants, came to the ring dressed like a winged Greek character, complete with a Greek soldier's helmet, <b>leather</b> <b>strap</b> outfit and both her face and body painted in black and red colors. She removed the attached wings and the metal helmet before the match. The teams were divided between the four tecnicas (Marcela, Estrellita, Princesa Sigehit and Goya Kong) facing off against the ruda team (La Amapola, Tiffany, Dalys and Zeuxis). After several minutes of wrestling, with all participants taking turns in the ring Tiffany was the first wrestler eliminated when Princesa Sugehit pinned her. Moments later the sides were evened out when La Amapola pinned the Mexican National Women's Champion Estrellita to eliminate her. From that point each elimination came quickly after each other, generally alternating between the two sides with Dalys, then Princesa Sugeith, then Goya Kong and finally La Amapola being eliminated leaving only Zeuxis and Marcela, the CMLL Women's World Champion. In the end Zeuxis completed the upset by defeating Marcel after also being instrumental in eliminating Princesa Sugeith and Goya Kong, winning the match. After the match Zeuxis posed with a trophy while celebrating her victory.|$|E
25|$|Four {{days after}} the {{discovery}} of Mixer's body, on March 25, a surveyor discovered the nude, mutilated body of a teenage girl behind a vacant house on a remote, rural section of Earhart Road, {{just a few hundred}} yards from where the body of Joan Schell had been discovered eight months previous. Investigators called to the crime scene noted a dramatic increase in the savagery exhibited against the victim, with one investigator describing the injuries inflicted upon the victim as being the worst he had seen in 30 years of police work. A subsequent autopsy revealed the victim had died of numerous fractures covering one-third of her skull and one side of her face, all of which had been inflicted with a heavy blunt instrument. These injuries had been inflicted after the victim had been extensively beaten and tortured: her killer had placed a section of her own shirt into her trachea to muffle her screams as she received extensive blunt force trauma to the face, head and body, including several deep lacerations believed to have been inflicted with a <b>leather</b> <b>strap.</b> Welt marks upon the chest and shoulders indicated the killer had also used restraints to hold the victim prone as he whipped her torso and upper legs with a leather belt before tearing a branch from a nearby tree and inserting this instrument eight inches into her vagina. Blood spatterings and churned soil close to the crime scene indicated she had been beaten close to where her body was discovered, and that she may have attempted to escape her attacker.|$|E
