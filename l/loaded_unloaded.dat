40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{stimulation}} of articular cartilage {{is known to}} be essential for chondrogenesis. In our study we use animal cartilage-bone explants from the femur condylus, which were divided into three experimental groups (<b>loaded,</b> <b>unloaded</b> and controls). Loading was performed in a sterile and physiological environment based on DME-medium. Cell morphology and cell vitality was observed by histological techniques. The knowledge gathered from the mechanical in-vitro study is now used to produce a structured artificial matrix resembling native cartilage in biochemical composition, biomechanical properties and zonal tissue structure. The artificial matrix is then seeded with chondrocytes and loaded with the same parameters we found to be ideal for tissue regeneration. Analysis is performed using histological and immuno-histological methods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{success of}} Java {{in recent years}} is largely due to its {{targeting}} as a language for the Internet. Many of the network-related features of Java however {{are not part of the}} core language design. In this paper we focus on the design of a more parsimonious Internet programming language, which supports network integration smoothly and coherently as part of its core specification. The key idea is to center these extensions around the unified notion of a cell. Cells are deployable containers of objects and code, which may import (plugin) and export (plugout) classes and operations. They may be dynamically linked and unlinked, locally or across the network. Cells may be dynamically <b>loaded,</b> <b>unloaded,</b> copied, and moved, and serve as units of security. At first approximation, cells can be thought of as a hybrid between modules and components. Here we concentrate on the design of JCells, a language which builds cells on top of the fundamental Java notions of class, object, and virtual machine. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{dry well}} is a {{subsurface}} storage facility that receives and temporarily stores stormwater runoff from roofs of structures. Discharge of this stored runoff from a dry well occurs through infiltration {{into the surrounding}} soils. A dry well may be either a structural chamber and/or an excavated pit filled with aggregate. Due to the relatively low level of expected pollutants in roof runoff, a dry well cannot be used to directly comply with the suspended solids and nutrient removal requirements contained in the NJDEP Stormwater Management Rules at N. J. A. C. 7 : 8. However, due to its storage capacity, a dry well {{may be used to}} reduce the total stormwater quality design storm runoff volume that a roof would ordinarily discharge to downstream stormwater management facilities. Purpose Dry wells can be used to reduce the increased volume of stormwater runoff caused by roofs of buildings. While generally not a significant source of runoff pollution, roofs {{are one of the most}} important sources of new or increased runoff volume from land development sites. Dry wells can also be used to indirectly enhance water quality by reducing the amount of stormwater quality design storm runoff volume to be treated by the other, downstream stormwater management facilities. Dry wells can also be used to meet the groundwater recharge requirements of the NJDEP Stormwater Management Rules. See Recharge BMP Design Guidelines in Chapter 6 : Groundwater Recharge for a complete discussion of these requirements and the use of dry wells and other groundwater recharge facilities to meet them. Conditions Where Practice Applies The use of dry wells is applicable only where their subgrade soils have the required permeability rates. Specific soil permeability requirements are presented below in Design Criteria. Like other BMPs that rely on infiltration, dry wells are not appropriate for areas where high pollutant or sediment loading is anticipated due to the potential for groundwater contamination. Specifically, dry wells must not be used in the following locations: • Industrial and commercial areas where solvents and/or petroleum products are <b>loaded,</b> <b>unloaded,</b> stored, or applied; or pesticides are <b>loaded,</b> <b>unloaded,</b> or stored...|$|E
30|$|A {{geographical}} {{multimodal transport}} network {{is made of}} links like roads, railways or waterways, on which vehicles moves; at its nodes, connecting infrastructures like terminals or logistics platforms where goods are <b>loaded,</b> <b>unloaded,</b> transhipped or processed in different ways can sometimes be found. To analyse transport operations over the network, costs or weights must be attached to these geographical links over which goods are transported and to the connecting points where goods are handled. However, most of these infrastructures {{can be used in}} different ways and with different costs. For example, ships of different sizes and operating costs can use the same waterway; at a terminal a truck's load can be transshipped on a train, bundled with some others on a ship or simply unloaded as it reached its destination. Normally, the costs of these alternative operations should be different, and a simple geographic network does not provide an adequate basis for detailed analyses of transports operations where the same infrastructure is used in different ways. To solve this problem, the basic idea is to create a virtual link with a specific cost for a particular use of an infrastructure [4, 6].|$|E
40|$|The plasma {{concentration}} of 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D [1, 25 (OH) 2 D] decreases during skeletal unloading and increases when normal weight bearing is restored. To determine whether {{these changes in}} plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D reflect changes in production, metabolic clearance, or both we measured the kinetics of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D metabolism in rats whose skeletons were normally <b>loaded,</b> <b>unloaded,</b> or reloaded {{after a period of}} nonweight bearing. Skeletal unloading produced a transient but striking fall in the production (- 73 %) and {{plasma concentration}} (- 72 %) of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D without having a significant effect (< 20 %) on metabolic clearance. Skeletal reloading returned production to normal. Bone formation predictably decreased during unloading and returned to normal after return to weight bearing. No consistent changes in blood ionized calcium, plasma immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (irPTH), or plasma phosphorus occurred. These data suggest that the changes in plasma 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D associated with changes in skeletal weight bearing primarily reflect changes in 1, 25 (OH) 2 D production. The data provide no evidence that the changes in 1, 25 (OH) 2 D production are a consequence of changes in blood ionized calcium, plasma irPTH, or phosphorus...|$|E

40|$|Recently, Gordeev et al. (2015) {{suggested}} {{a method to}} test global MHD models against statistical empirical data. They showed that four community-available global MHD models supported by the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) produce a reasonable agreement with reality for those key parameters (the magnetospheric size, magnetic field, and pressure) that {{are directly related to}} the large-scale equilibria in the outer magnetosphere. Based on the same set of simulation runs, here we investigate how the models reproduce the global loading-unloading cycle. We found that in terms of global magnetic flux transport, three examined CCMC models display systematically different response to idealized 2 h north then 2 h south interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) Bz variation. The LFM model shows a depressed return convection and high loading rate during the growth phase as well as enhanced return convection and high unloading rate during the expansion phase, with the amount of <b>loaded</b> <b>unloaded</b> magnetotail flux and the growth phase duration being the closest to their observed empirical values during isolated substorms. Two other models exhibit drastically different behavior. In the BATS-R-US model the plasma sheet convection shows a smooth transition to the steady convection regime after the IMF southward turning. In the Open GGCM a weak plasma sheet convection has comparable intensities during both the growth phase and the following slow unloading phase. We also demonstrate potential technical problem in the publicly available simulations which is related to post processing interpolation and could affect the accuracy of magnetic field tracing and of other related procedures...|$|E
