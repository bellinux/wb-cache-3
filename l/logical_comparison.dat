5000|$|Offset binary, also {{referred}} to as excess-K, excess-N, excess code or biased representation, is a digital coding scheme where all-zero corresponds to the minimal negative value and all-one to the maximal positive value. There is no standard for offset binary, but most often the offset K for an n-bit binary word is K = 2n−1. This has the consequence that the [...] "zero" [...] value is represented by a 1 in the most significant bit and zero in all other bits, and in general the effect is conveniently the same as using twos complement except that the most significant bit is inverted. It also has the consequence that in a <b>logical</b> <b>comparison</b> operation, one gets the same result as with a twos complement numerical comparison operation, whereas, in twos complement notation a <b>logical</b> <b>comparison</b> will agree with twos complement numerical comparison operation if and only if the numbers being compared have the same sign. Otherwise the sense of the comparison will be inverted, with all negative values being taken as being larger than all positive values.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a phase-inductance-based position estimation method for interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs). According to {{the characteristics of}} phase induction of IPMSMs, the corresponding relationship of the rotor position and the phase inductance is obtained. In order to eliminate {{the effect of the}} zero-sequence component of phase inductance and reduce the rotor position estimation error, the phase inductance difference is employed. With the iterative computation of inductance vectors, the position plane is further subdivided, and the rotor position is extracted by comparing the amplitudes of inductance vectors. To decrease the consumption of computer resources and increase the practicability, a simplified implementation is also investigated. In this method, the rotor position information is achieved easily, with several basic math operations and <b>logical</b> <b>comparisons</b> of phase inductances, without any coordinate transformation or trigonometric function calculation. Based on this position estimation method, the field orientated control (FOC) strategy is established, and the detailed implementation is also provided.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a new, automatic technique {{to assess whether}} replacing a component of a software system by a purportedly compatible component may change {{the behavior of the}} system. The technique operates before integrating the new component into the system or running system tests, permitting quicker and cheaper identification of problems. It takes into account the system’s use of the component, because a particular component upgrade may be desirable in one context but undesirable in another. No formal specifications are required, permitting detection of problems due either to errors in the component or to errors in the system. Both external and internal behaviors can be compared, enabling detection of problems that are not immediately reflected in the output. The technique generates an operational abstraction for the old component {{in the context of the}} system, and one for the new component in the context of its test suite. An operational abstraction is a set of program properties that generalizes over observed run-time behavior. Modeling a system as divided into modules, and taking into account the control and data flow between the modules, we formulate a logical condition to guarantee that the system’s behavior is preserved across a component replacement.

30|$|Another {{domain of}} {{denoising}} techniques {{studies on the}} principle of shrinkage [13]. The shrinkage method uses nonlinear thresholding approach to shrink the orthogonal wavelet coefficients as a denoising tool. This method relies on the idea that the energy of the function is often concentrated in a few wavelet coefficients while the energy of the noise is spread over all coefficients, therefore by selecting a suitable threshold value it is possible to reduce a significant amount of noise elements by using nonlinear thresholding in the wavelet domain [13]. However, the denoised signal in this case may contain spurious oscillations due to the translation variant property of the discrete wavelet transform. Afterwards, several approaches were proposed to overcome these problems of shrinkage but so far none of them guarantees the preservation of edges or sharp variations possibly due to their working in an orthogonal basis [13 – 17]. Fodor and Kamath presented a brief survey of some of these approaches [17]. More recently, Blu and Luisier presented {{the state of the art}} SURE-LET method for image denoising [18]. The performance of the SURE-LET method is quite outstanding in the presence of Gaussian noise. In the present study, we are addressing only 1 D signal therefore it is not possible to compare with the SURE-LET method. However in the future study, the extension of the proposed method for 2 D cases will give <b>logical</b> <b>comparison</b> of the two methods.|$|E
