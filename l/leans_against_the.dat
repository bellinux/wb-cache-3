25|$|In the {{background}} of the painting various objects are used to further symbolize the theological significance of the subject. A ladder, referring to Jacob's Ladder, <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> back wall, and a dove which represents the Holy Spirit rests on it. Other carpentry implements refer to the Holy Trinity. Millais likely used Albrecht Dürer's print Melancholia I as a source for this imagery, along with quattrocento works. The sheep in the sheepfold seen through the door represent the future Christian flock.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy. In regards to the video's concept, Swift stated, [...] "It deals with the haunting power of music and how hearing a song {{years after it was}} first popular can have such an emotional appeal." [...] Clayton Collins portrayed Swift's love interest in the music video. He was cast because of his physical resemblance to the real subject of the song, in that they were both tall with dark hair. The video begins with Swift, dressed by a white sundress, as she lies on the grass of a lake-bed and holds a transistor radio. Suddenly, the setting is switched to Collins as he drives a white and orange 1970 Chevrolet CST-10. He then turns his radio on and ceases driving, coming to a complete stop on a road. As Collins facial expressions become more serious, he flashbacks to memories with Swift. Swift and Collins are seen frolicking in a field, lying beside another on the back of Collins' CST-10, staring at the stars together, holding hands as they walk, and slow dancing. When the song is in its final chorus, Collins arrives at a wooden cabin in his pick-up truck. He runs up the staircase to discover an enveloped letter next to the door. He then sits on the staircase, opens the envelope, and reads the letter. The video transcends towards Swift playing an acoustic guitar as she <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wooden cabin. Cut-scenes feature Swift lying on the lake-bed and performing with a guitar next to the wooden cabin. The video concludes with Swift, once again, lying on the initial setting.|$|E
2500|$|... "The 34-Ton Bat"-named for the enormous, 120-foot-tall bat that <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Louisville Slugger Museum in Louisville, Ky.-is full of bits of {{information}} that will give even the most knowledgeable fan {{a new understanding of}} the game and of those who have played it. 'Material culture' is the academic term for the study of physical objects as a means of getting at larger truths and understanding historical turning points. It is exactly what anthropologists and archaeologists have long done, as they coax conclusions from shards of pottery and projectile points. In recent years, popular authors have taken a page from this playbook and given us, among other titles, Neil MacGregor's [...] "A History of the World in 100 Objects," [...] Harold Holzer's [...] "The Civil War in 50 Objects" [...] and Tom Standage's [...] "A History of the World in 6 Glasses." [...] Now veteran Sports Illustrated writer and columnist Steve Rushin has applied this notion to baseball by rummaging through the attic of the national pastime and telling its story through objects as central as the bat and ball and even humbler elements-including the primitive steel cups fashioned to protect the [...] "family jewels" [...] and ballpark urinals, a necessity made all the more urgent because of the oceans of beer consumed at ballparks." ...|$|E

And then the little spalpeen laughs, and he calls the captain, and the captain calls the purser, and they pipe up the chief engineer, and the whole gang <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cabin and laughs at Clancy's {{wardrobe}} for Guatemala.|$|E

60|$|The young officer <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bar, {{and listens}} to stories by Mr. Ford, which it behooves no church members to hear. He smokes Mr. Hopper's cigar and drinks his whiskey.

Mr. Hopper neither drinks nor smokes, but he uses the spittoon with more freedom in this atmosphere.|$|E

He opens the sitting-room door, but he can see nothing. He has been left there without a candle. He peers up the stairs, but a faint glimmer of light shining through the keyhole of his wife's door is all that meets his eye.
