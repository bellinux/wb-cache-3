40|$|Detailed {{measurements}} with hot-wires {{and pressure}} probes are presented for {{the interaction between}} a turbulent longitudinal vortex pair with 'common flow' down, and a turbulent boundary layer. The interaction has a larger value of the vortex circulation parameter, and therefore better represents many aircraft/vortex interactions, than those studied previously. The vortices move down towards the boundary layer, but only the outer parts of the vortices actually enter it. Beneath the vortices the boundary layer is thinned by <b>lateral</b> <b>divergence</b> {{to the extent that}} it almost ceases to grow. Outboard of the vortices the boundary layer is thickened by lateral convergence. The changes in turbulence structure parameters in the boundary layer appear to be due to the effects of 'extra-rate-of-strain' produced by <b>lateral</b> <b>divergence</b> (or convergence) and by free-stream turbulence. The effect of the interaction on the vortices (other than the inviscid effect of the image vortices below the surface) is small. The flow constitutes a searching test case for prediction methods for three-dimensional turbulent flows...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the second}} of two papers on the {{interaction}} between a longitudinal vortex pair, produced by a delta-wing at angle of attack, and a turbulent boundary layer developing on a flat plate. In the first paper only the outer parts of the vortices entered the boundary layer whereas in this paper the vortices merge with it. In the resultant interaction, the boundary layer between the vortices is kept thin by <b>lateral</b> <b>divergence</b> and a three-dimensional separation line is formed outboard of each vortex. Turbulent, momentum-deficient fluid containing longitudinal vorticity is entrained from the boundary layer along these lines and wrapped around the vortices. As a consequence, the turbulent region of the vortices increases in size and the circulation slowly decreases. It is shown that the flow near the separation line and in the vortices is complicated, and this interaction {{is expected to be}} more difficult to calculate than the first.

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulation (DNS) {{is used to}} {{study the effects of}} mean <b>lateral</b> <b>divergence</b> and convergence on wall-bounded turbulence, by applying uniform irrotational temporal deformations to a plane-channel domain. This extends a series of studies of similar deformations. Fast and slow straining fields are considered, leading to a matrix of four cases, all corresponding to zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) flows along the centreplane in ducts with constant rectangular cross-sectional area but varying aspect ratio. The results are used to address basic physical and modelling questions, and create a database that allows detailed yet straightforward testing of turbulence models. Initial tests of three representative one-point models reveal meaningful differences. The extra-strain effects introduced by the matrix of fast and slow divergence and convergence are documented, separating the direct effects of the strain from the indirect ones that alter the shear rate and change the distance from the wall. Some findings are predictable, and none contradict experimental findings.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{majority}} of pollen-tube growth in Arabidopsis occurs in specialized tissue called the transmitting tract. Little is currently known {{about how the}} transmitting tract functions {{because of a lack}} of mutants affecting its development. We have identified such a mutant and we used it to investigate aspects of pollen-tube growth. ResultsReverse genetics was used to identify mutations in a gene, NO TRANSMITTING TRACT (NTT), encoding a C 2 H 2 /C 2 HC zinc finger transcription factor specifically expressed in the transmitting tract. The ntt mutants have a negative effect on transmitting-tract development. Stage-specific analysis of transmitting-tract development was carried out and was correlated with investigations of pollen-tube behavior. In ntt mutants, pollen tubes grow more slowly and/or terminate prematurely, and <b>lateral</b> <b>divergence</b> is accentuated over apical-to-basal movement. Normal transmitting-tract development is shown to involve a process of programmed cell death (PCD) that is facilitated by, but does not depend upon, pollination. ConclusionsThis is the first report of a gene that is specifically required for transmitting-tract development in Arabidopsis. Mutations in NTT cause reduced fertility by severely inhibiting pollen-tube movement. The data support the idea that the function of the transmitting tract is to increase fertilization efficiency, particularly in the lower half of the ovary. This occurs by facilitating pollen-tube growth through differentiation and then death of transmitting-tract cells...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} spatial {{variations}} in ice thickness, accumulation rate and <b>lateral</b> flow <b>divergence</b> on radar-detected isochrone geometry in ice sheets is computed using an analytical method, under assumptions of a steady-state ice-sheet geometry, a steady-state accumulation pattern and a horizontally uniform velocity shape function. By {{using a new}} coordinate transform, we show that {{the slope of the}} isochrones (with a normalized vertical coordinate) depends on three terms: a principal term which determines the sign of the slope, and two scale factors which can modify only the amplitude of the slope. The principal term depends only on a local characteristic time (ice thickness divided by accumulation rate minus melting rate) between the initial and final positions of the ice particle. For plug flow, only the initial and final values have an influence. Further applications are a demonstration of how the vertical velocity profile can be deduced from sharp changes in isochrone slopes induced by abrupt steps in bedrock or mass balance along the ice flow. We also demonstrate ways the new coordinate system may be used to test the accuracy of numerical flow models...|$|R
40|$|The flow at {{the leading}} edge and in the {{interior}} of a rectangular porous obstruction is described through experiments and scaling. The porous obstruction consists of an emergent, rectangular array of cylinders in shallow flow, a configuration that mimics aquatic vegetation. The main features of the flow depend upon the non-dimensional canopy flow-blockage, which {{is a function of the}} obstruction width and porosity. For the ranges of canopy flow-blockage tested in this paper, the fluid decelerates upstream of the obstruction over a length scale proportional to the array width. For high flow-blockage, the interior adjustment length within the porous obstruction is set by the array width. For low flow-blockage, the array's frontal area per unit volume sets the interior adjustment length. Downstream of the adjustment regions, the interior velocity is governed by a balance between the <b>lateral</b> <b>divergence</b> of the turbulent stress and canopy drag, or by a balance between the pressure gradient and canopy drag, depending on the lateral penetration into the array of Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) vortices, which is set by the non-dimensional canopy flow-blockage. For a porous obstruction with two stream-parallel edges, the KH vortex streets along the two edges are in communication across the width of the array: a phenomenon that results in cross-array vortex organization, which significantly enhances the vortex strength and creates significant lateral transport within the porous obstruction.

Gulps were either restricted to the inter-mandibular area or involved expansion of the whole ventral pouch; the extent of filling appears to be under voluntary control. Gulps may have different functions, e. g. feeding or display. Maximum gape (about 70 º) occurred during inter-mandibular gulps, involving both depression of the lower jaw and elevation {{of the head and}} upper jaw. The lower jaw was depressed only to about 40 º, much less than the 90 º generally illustrated in the literature for rorquals. The mouth was closed as the ventral pouch was still filling; closure was rapid, associated with the moderate depression of the lower jaw. The whole ventral pouch contracted uniformly to expel water. The fibrocartilage skeleton of the ventral pouch was involved in outpocketing of the mental (“chin”) region both {{at the beginning and end}} of gulps. During expulsion of water, partial axial rotation of the lower jaw maintained a groove just lateral to the baleen plates, opening as a vertical slit posteriorly. This would allow water expelled between the baleen plates to flow backwards, especially from the angle of the mouth. Incorporating these new observations, we discuss evolution of filter feeding and suggest that suction feeding was the primitive condition for baleen whales...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThree-dimensional ice flow {{modelling}} {{requires a}} large number of computing resources and observation data, such that 2 -D simulations are often preferable. However, when there is significant <b>lateral</b> <b>divergence,</b> this must be accounted for (2. 5 -D models), and a flow tube is considered (volume between two horizontal flowlines). In the absence of velocity observations, this flow tube can be derived assuming that the flowlines follow the steepest slope of the surface, under a few flow assumptions. This method typically consists of scanning a digital elevation model (DEM) with a moving window and computing the curvature at the centre of this window. The ability of the 2. 5 -D models to account properly for a 3 -D state of strain and stress has not clearly been established, nor their sensitivity {{to the size of the}} scanning window and to the geometry of the ice surface, for example in the cases of sharp ridges. Here, we study the applicability of a 2. 5 -D ice flow model around a dome, typical of the East Antarctic plateau conditions. A twin experiment is carried out, comparing 3 -D and 2. 5 -D computed velocities, on three dome geometries, for several scanning windows and thermal conditions. The chosen scanning window used to evaluate the ice surface curvature should be comparable to the typical radius of this curvature. For isothermal ice, the error made by the 2. 5 -D model is in the range 0 – 10 % for weakly diverging flows, but is 2 or 3 times higher for highly diverging flows and could lead to a non-physical ice surface at the dome. For non-isothermal ice, assuming a linear temperature profile, the presence of a sharp ridge makes the 2. 5 -D velocity field unre-alistic. In such cases, the basal ice is warmer and more easily laterally strained than the upper one, the walls of the flow tube are not vertical, and the assumptions of the 2. 5 -D model are no longer valid...|$|E

40|$|Analysis of {{the balance}} {{equation}} for Favre-averaged progress variable variance developed previously areextended to open premixed flames in this paper. It is shown that both conditional mean dilatation and bulk-flow straining {{are linked to the}} turbulent scalar flux being countergradient (CGD) or gradient (GD) diffusion. The effect of bulk-flow straining is further investigated by using recent experimental data of joint particle image velocimetry/laser-induced OH fluorescence measurements in turbulent premixed Bunsenand stagnation-type flames. A diverging mean flow field is found for these open flames witheither CGD or GD transport, and the conditional mean dilatation always peaks near the burnt side of the local flame fronts. The coincidence of the conditional mean dilatation peaking at low values of progress variable and the gradient-type turbulent scalar flux is expected only for confined premixed flames without <b>lateral</b> mean flow <b>divergence</b> or for simulated flames in direct numerical simulations (DNS) having no bulk-flow straining. A positive correlation has been observed between scalar diffusion and scalar dissipation in both DNS data and in laser measurements of open premixed flames. For these flames at high turbulent levels where gradient transport prevails, the conflicting behavior of local flame-front thinning or thickening is reconciled. Yung-Cheng Chen, Peter A. M.

30|$|The highest SO_ 2 {{discharge}} rate of 1500 tons/day was recorded {{during this period}} (Figs.  3 c, 11), which indicates that {{a significant amount of}} volcanic fluid was still being supplied from below. Since the first ash–gas emission (100 tons of ash; Miyabuchi, Personal Communication, 2014) occurred on 13 January (Fig.  2 e), {{at the end of this}} stage, we consider that the fluid was more magmatic than in previous stages. From this viewpoint, the CT source location may be noteworthy, in that the source depth (200 – 400 m; Fig.  11) evidently coincided with the uppermost part of the crack. However, there was some <b>lateral</b> <b>divergence</b> from the crack (Fig.  9 b), and the source depth shows apparent upward migration with some back and forth fluctuations (Fig.  11). In order to explain these results, one possible scenario is that a process forming a new route for the volcanic fluid leading to the 13 January event occurred just beside the existing crack (west side) (Fig.  10). A phenomenon similar to a tremor, cyclic forward and backward migration, was recorded in association with a dike propagation (Caudron et al. 2018). At Aso volcano, no different VLP events were observed even when magmatic eruptions occurred (Sandanbata et al. 2015), and those during periods with a sustained crater lake. This suggests that there are several (isolated) pathways beneath the crater (one is for magmatic fluid without VLP events, i.e., the new west route; and the other is for a great deal of gaseous fluid related to repeated VLP events, i.e., the crack). At a depth of < 200 m above the confluence point between these pathways, the fluid path was already large enough to accommodate the fluid for the 13 January event. This is the reason why no CT source location was determined before the eruption. However, we cannot precisely explain why this kind of process to form a new pathway did not generate a significant CT amplitude, as in Stages II and III (Fig.  11). A more accurate picture of the conduit system of Aso volcano should also be obtained. Once the ash–gas emission occurred at the end of this stage, the pressure decreased in the pathway and thus the tremor amplitude decreased to the background level (Fig.  11).|$|E
40|$|Space-frame {{structures}} supporting marine {{renewable energy}} machines such as offshore wind turbines {{are exposed to}} complex hydrodynamic forces resulting from the coexistence of waves and currents. Previous investigations on the interaction of such a structure acting as an obstacle array with regular waves and in-line uniform current reported a reduced fluid loading due to current blockage. This paper documents laboratory-scale experimental evidence for reduced fluid loading on a truss structure exposed to regular waves with in-line sheared current in shallow water. Strongly sheared current of different speeds is generated and profiled using purposely-built wire resistance arrays in a wave-current flume, {{and a range of}} regular waves are created using a piston-type wavemaker. The global hydrodynamic force time history on a truss structure is measured for a range of sheared current speeds and regular wave heights. For all test cases, two loading configurations are considered, with the truss positioned end-on and diagonal to the incident flow direction. Comparisons are made with the analytical current blockage model for steady uniform current by Taylor (1991) and Taylor et al. (2013), and with the numerical simulations conducted in OpenFOAM using a porous tower model following the approach by Santo et al. (2015 a). Under the same input condition, the diagonal loading configuration is observed to attract higher forces and therefore the orientation of the structure plays an important role when assessing the survivability of such structures. Overall, good agreement in terms of the peak forces and the shapes of force time histories is achieved for all cases with an inline current, all with a single and consistent value for each of the local Morison drag and inertia coefficients (here Cd ∼ 2. 1 and Cm ∼ 2), with the coefficients defined in terms of the overall structure. In contrast, predictions using the present API recommendation with the same Cd and Cm result in force overpredictions for all cases of regular waves with in-line current. For steady sheared current flow through a porous tower, apart from the dominant <b>lateral</b> flow <b>divergence,</b> numerical flow visualisation reveals the existence of vertical flow interaction in the porous tower. This is attributed to the non-uniform loading with water depth and was not observed previously for uniform current flow. This study provides the first experimental validation and justification for the use of a simple porous block in representing a complex geometry of real space-frame structures when exposed to combined large regular waves and in-line current...|$|R
40|$|Detonation {{waves are}} {{supersonic}} combustion waves {{that have a}} complex three-dimensional cellular structure. There is growing experimental evidence that the cellular structure of detonations promotes their propagation {{in the presence of}} losses. In spite of that, the conventional model for the detonation structure, known as the Zeldovich - Von Neumann - Doring (ZND) model, neglects the existence of cellular structure for detonations and assumes the wave to consist of a strong leading planar shock coupled with trailing chemical reactions. Therefore, the influence of cellular structure on the dynamics and extinction limits of detonation waves has been of particular interest. Previous studies have investigated the influence of cellular structure on the dynamics of detonations with mass divergence in the framework of narrow tubes, porous-walled tubes and weak confinement. However, precise quantification of the loss mechanism in these frameworks has been associated with some difficulties. Complex flow in the boundary layers, inherent in thin tubes, or attenuation of the transverse waves in the porous-walled tubes has made the evaluation of the loss mechanism more difficult in such geometries. In this thesis, a novel well-posed problem is formulated for detonations with mass divergence. It is shown that detonations propagating in a channel with a cross-section area increasing exponentially have a constant mass divergence. The detonations were found to propagate at a quasi-steady speed below the ideal Chapman-Jouguet velocity. This permitted to make meaningful comparison with the theoretical models and simulations. The experiments were performed in two mixtures, one displaying characteristic weakly unstable detonations (2 C 2 H 2 + 5 O 2 + 21 Ar), and the other displaying highly unstable detonations (C 3 H 8 + 5 O 2). The dependence of the velocity deficits and limits on the amount of mass divergence for the two mixtures were compared with the predictions of the quasi-one-dimensional ZND model with <b>lateral</b> mass <b>divergence.</b> Since the ZND model neglects the cellular structure of the detonations, such comparison permitted to asses the influence of cellular structure on the dynamics of detonations with mass divergence. Comparisons were also made with the results of simulations of inviscid cellular detonations. These comparisons showed that the velocity deficits and critical rate of mass divergence in the weakly unstable mixture were reasonably well predicted by the quasi-one-dimensional model. For smaller values of mass divergence rate, a good agreement between the experiments and the predictions of the two-dimensional cellular simulations was observed for the weakly unstable mixture. For the highly unstable detonations, the quasi-one-dimensional model significantly over-predicted the effect of mass divergence. Detonations were observed for rates of mass divergence 93...|$|R

In this thesis, I use the three-spined stickleback as a model system for wild immunological studies. First, I developed a set of markers to measure the expression levels of key immune system genes using quantitative real-time PCR, representing the innate and adaptive immune response, and then used them to address a number of questions. I demonstrated that there are underlying differences in innate and adaptive gene expression levels between populations, as well as in innate immune response potential, which may reflect the contrasting challenges faced in these populations. By sampling individuals from multiple wild populations, I was able to demonstrate how a range of factors contribute to shaping immune system function, including sex, reproductive status, and infection with the common parasites Schistocephalus solidus and Gyrodactylus arcuatus. Next, I exposed laboratory raised fish to natural conditions and examined their response. Again, a range of factors where identified which appear to shape immune expression levels, particularly reproductive investment and infection with G. arcuatus. I also used this approach to demonstrate that immune system variation can be linked to Eda genotype, the gene which controls <b>lateral</b> plate phenotypic <b>divergence</b> during adaptive radiations. Finally, I performed a controlled infection experiment in the laboratory to show that both the innate and adaptive systems respond to Gyrodactylus infection.
