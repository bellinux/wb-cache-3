50|$|The Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland {{permitted}} {{the state to}} ratify the Lisbon Treaty of the European Union. It was effected by the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty of <b>Lisbon)</b> <b>Act</b> 2009, which was approved by referendum on 2 October 2009 (sometimes known as the Lisbon II referendum).|$|E
5000|$|On September 27, 1965, the Philippines adopted {{pertinent}} {{provisions of the}} <b>Lisbon</b> <b>Act</b> of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property by reference {{as part of the}} Intellectual Property Code. As a multilateral treaty, the Paris Convention seeks to “protect industrial property … {{and at the same time}} repress unfair competition”. It also “provides for the protection of internationally well-known marks” and “applications claiming the priority date of an earlier-filed application in Member Countries”. Another treaty pertinent to intellectual property rights, particularly trademarks, is the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO), which the Philippines ratified on December 16, 1994, and which treaty took effect only on January 1, 1995. Annexed to this is the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) which aims to “reduce distortions … in international trade … promote effective and adequate protection of intellectual property rights…. and adhere to minimum standards of protection set by several conventions.... The TRIPS Agreement seeks to grant adequate protection of intellectual property rights by creating a favorable economic environment to encourage the inflow of foreign investments, and strengthening the multilateral trading system to bring about economic, cultural, and technological independence.” ...|$|E
500|$|Parker and the Amazon {{remained}} with Nelson after {{the division of}} the Mediterranean commands left the Spanish coasts under the supervision of Sir John Orde. Nelson suspected that Orde was intercepting his despatches and commandeering Nelson's frigates to use himself. Nelson therefore ordered Parker not to stop for any of Orde's ships if this was possible. Parker attempted this but was intercepted by [...] He was however able to convince the Eurydices commander, William Hoste, to turn a blind eye and having delivered his despatches to <b>Lisbon,</b> <b>acted</b> on Nelson's hint that he was not expected back until February by carrying out a cruise that netted him several prizes worth a total of £20,000. Orde complained about the 'poaching' taking place on his station, but the prize money went to Parker and Nelson.|$|R
5000|$|Fernandes was {{selected}} by the national public broadcaster Rádio e Televisão de Portugal (RTP) {{as a result of}} her victory at the Festival da Canção 2008, the Portuguese national final, held on 9 March 2008, at the Teatro Camões, in <b>Lisbon.</b> Ten <b>acts</b> entered the competition to represent the country at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 in Belgrade, Serbia, with the winner being selected through SMS and televoting.|$|R
50|$|He {{comes back}} to Portugal in 1969, after Salazar's illness and {{replacement}} by Marcello Caetano, which originated some political and cultural opening in the regime. From then on he, among many other things, continued to write, teach at Portuguese universities, direct the Centro de Estudos Latinoamericanos (Latin-American Studies Center) at Technical University of <b>Lisbon,</b> and <b>acted</b> {{as a consultant to}} Instituto de Cultura e Língua Portuguesa (ICALP, Portuguese Culture and Language Institute).|$|R
40|$|Based on {{theoretical}} and methodological orientations from authors’ {{previous research on}} media and generations, this article presents a research and learning process involving supervised field work conducted by graduate students from a Master Seminar on Media Studies at FCSH, New University of <b>Lisbon.</b> <b>Acting</b> as facilitators of focus groups composed of older participants, exploring intergenerational and intragenerational differences and similarities that emerge from different age cohorts, and critically reflecting on this experience on their individual essays, {{students were able to}} build a contextual knowledge of media uses among their grandparents’ and parents’ generation in Portugal. The choice of focus groups as a tool for research and the topic of generations to be investigated within Media Studies proved to be very productive. The article argues on the potentialities of this intergenerational relation between facilitator and focus groups’ respondents as a way of activating the interactions inside the groups, leading –for instance– the participants to assume an «explaining» attitude in selfaccounting. Final notes are presented about the educational gains of this methodology for Media Education and for different branches of Media Studies, such as media and social history, journalism and the news or political participation...|$|R
50|$|Between 2004 and 2009, Vale de Almeida was the Head of Cabinet (Chief {{of staff}} and main adviser) for European Commission President José Manuel Barroso. He {{accompanied}} President Barroso in all European Council (EU Summit) meetings and ensured coordination with the private offices of Heads of State and Government in all 28 Member States of the EU. He was also the President’s Personal Representative for the negotiations on the Treaty of <b>Lisbon</b> and <b>acted</b> as his personal representative (sherpa) for G8 and G20 summits as well as negotiations on the Treaty of Lisbon.|$|R
50|$|Philip played groups {{against each}} other, {{leading to a}} system of checks and {{balances}} that managed affairs inefficiently, even to the extent of damaging state business, as in the Perez affair. Following a fire in Valladolid in 1561, Philip resisted calls to move his Court to <b>Lisbon,</b> an <b>act</b> that could have curbed centralisation and bureaucracy domestically as well as relaxed rule in the Empire. Instead, with the traditional Royal and Primacy seat of Toledo now essentially obsolete, Philip moved his Court to the Castilian stronghold of Madrid. Except for a brief period under Philip III, Madrid has remained the capital of Spain.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{appointed}} British ambassador in Paris {{from the post}} of British envoy to Yugoslavia - a considerable jump in promotion which was extremely rare in the diplomatic service. Such an important position is normally reserved for diplomats who have passed through several legations and other embassies. However, it was long recognized that Campbell possessed outstanding abilities. Following the fall of France in June 1940, he was evacuated through Saint-Jean-de-Luz on [...] and returned to London. In November {{of the same year}} he was transferred to <b>Lisbon</b> to <b>act</b> as British ambassador. He retired from the Foreign Office {{at the end of his}} period of service as British ambassador to Portugal in July 1945.|$|R
50|$|Peter Scarlett {{was educated}} at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. He entered the Foreign Office in 1929 {{and served in}} Cairo, Baghdad and <b>Lisbon.</b> He <b>acted</b> as Chargé d’Affaires in Riga 1937-38 and was {{attached}} to the representative of Latvia at the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937. He served in Brussels from 1938 to 1940 when he was captured by enemy forces but, as a diplomat, was returned to the UK where he resumed duties at the Foreign Office until 1944 when he was appointed to the embassy in Paris under Sir Alfred Duff Cooper. In 1946 he moved to Allied Forces Headquarters at Caserta, southern Italy, then was Counsellor at the Foreign Office 1947-50 and Inspector of HM Diplomatic Service Establishments 1950-52.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{appointed}} the English envoy to Portugal in 1691, to his delight, {{as he looked}} forward to a [...] "not too onerous position in an agreeable climate". He established good relations with King Pedro II which were of value later in negotiating the Methuen Treaty, but was required to return to England on his appointment to the Council of Trade, while his son Paul remained in <b>Lisbon</b> to <b>act</b> as deputy envoy. John had two powerful friends in James Vernon, the Under-Secretary of State, and Vernon's great patron Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland, who, though he was not then a Minister, was probably King William's closest political adviser. On the death of Sir Charles Porter they recommended Methuen as Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Although Lord Somers, the English Lord Chancellor, thought little of Methuen, saying that he knew of [...] "nothing that qualified him for such an office", Sunderland at that time effectively controlled Court patronage, and Methuen was duly appointed.|$|R
5|$|The Commission {{differs from}} the other {{institutions}} in that it alone has legislative initiative in the EU. Only the Commission can make formal proposals for legislation: they cannot originate in the legislative branches. Under the Treaty of <b>Lisbon,</b> no legislative <b>act</b> is allowed {{in the field of}} the Common Foreign and Security Policy. In the other fields the Council and Parliament are able to request legislation; in most cases the Commission initiates the basis of these proposals. This monopoly is designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of EU law. This monopoly has been challenged by some who claim the Parliament should also have the right, with most national parliaments holding the right in some respects. However, the Council and Parliament may request the Commission to draft legislation, though the Commission does have the power to refuse to do so as it did in 2008 over transnational collective conventions. Under the Lisbon Treaty, EU citizens are also able to request the Commission to legislate in an area via a petition carrying one million signatures, but this is not binding.|$|R
50|$|Dmitry Glinka {{graduated}} from the boarding school of Saint Petersburg University in 1824. On January 17, 1825, he joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and began his diplomatic career, holding posts such as second secretary at the Russian embassy in Copenhagen (since May, 1831), chief secretary in Stockholm (since March, 1837), and then counsellor in Berlin (since July, 1846). In 1834 Dmitry married Christina Justina Christine Blanche von Bangemann-Huygens, comtesse of Løvendal (February 24, 1810 - 1893). In 1836 their daughter Justine Glinka (Iustinia Dmitrievna Glinka) (July 21, 1836 - 1916) was born, and in 1838 their son Nikolai Dmitrievich Glinka (1838 - April 1, 1884) was born. While in Stockholm, Dmitry Glinka served as charge d'affairs from May 22, 1841 until March 14, 1844. He was promoted {{to the rank of}} state councillor on March 25, 1844. Some six years later Dmitry Glinka was appointed charge d'affairs at the House of Hesse-Darmstadt, House of Hesse-Kassel, and House of Nassau. On April 8, 1851, he was promoted to state councillor in deed. In 1853, Dmitry Glinka was dispatched to Frankfurt am Main, where he would develop a rapport with Otto von Bismarck. Being a supporter of an alliance between Russia, France and Prussia, Dmitry Glinka was trying to impede the anti-Russian policy of Otto Theodor von Manteuffel, a Prussian foreign minister. On June 8, 1853, he was dismissed as charge d'affairs at the House of Hesse and then three years later appointed envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Brazil, becoming privy councillor in April 1863. In 1871, Dmitry Glinka was transferred to <b>Lisbon</b> to <b>act</b> as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, remaining on this post until his death. On April 12, 1881, he was promoted to privy councillor in deed.|$|R
