5|$|Militarily, it is {{difficult}} to draw many lessons from Salamis, because of the uncertainty about what actually happened. Once again the Allies chose their ground well in order to negate Persian numbers, but this time (unlike Thermopylae) had to rely on the Persians <b>launching</b> <b>an</b> unnecessary attack for their position to count.

5|$|In September 1944, Adolf Hitler {{resolved}} to recover Germany′s deteriorating fortunes by <b>launching</b> <b>an</b> offensive in the West. On 16 September, Hitler directed Generalleutnant Werner Kreipe—Chief of the General Staff—to prepare the necessary aircraft for the offensive. On 21 October, Kreipe ordered the air fleet defending the Greater German Reich (Luftflotte Reich) {{to hand over}} seven Jagdgeschwader and Schlachtgeschwader to Air Command West (Luftwaffenkommando West) for a future offensive.|$|E

French accounts claim that Church attempted an attack on Acadia's capital of Port Royal, but Church's account of the expedition describes a war council in which the expedition decided against making an attack.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 27, sentries {{informed}} Magaw that Percy's troops were <b>launching</b> <b>an</b> attack supported by two frigates sailing up the Hudson. Magaw ordered {{an attack on the}} frigates, and both British ships were badly damaged by the guns from Fort Lee and Fort Washington. The frigates could not elevate their own guns to the height of the American positions. The British towed away the frigates, but an artillery duel continued for some time between British and American gunners.|$|E
5|$|Several {{supporters}} of the attack later said on a messageboard that taking down websites {{was not enough to}} convince the government to back down on the web filtering policy and called for violence. Others disagreed with such actions and proposed <b>launching</b> <b>an</b> additional attack on a popular government site. A spokesman for Electronic Frontiers Australia said he believed there was no real intention or capacity to follow through with any of the violent threats.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the invading army's entry into Laconia, Sparta was only lightly defended. The {{majority}} of the Spartan army had accompanied Areus on campaign in Crete, where the Lacedaimonians were supporting the polis of Gortyn. As such, Sparta must have seemed like an easy target to Pyrrhus. Arriving outside Sparta in the evening, Cleonymus advised Pyrrhus to attack immediately {{to take advantage of the}} dearth of defenders. Pyrrhus decided against <b>launching</b> <b>an</b> immediate offensive as he feared the destruction that would be wrought by his Gallic soldiers if they were to enter the city at night. Anticipating no resistance, Pyrrhus order his army to make camp and prepared to enter Sparta in the morning.|$|E

5|$|Karasahr was besieged in 644 by Guo. Tang forces {{defeated}} the kingdom, captured the king, and a pro-Tang {{member of the}} royal family was enthroned as ruler. The new king was deposed by the Western Turks soon afterwards, and the Western Turks regained suzerainty over Karasahr. Suvarnadeva died between 646 and 648, and his brother Haripushpa (Chinese: Helibushibi) inherited the throne as Kucha's king. Although Haripushpa sent two tribute embassies to the Tang court, Tang Taizong had already decided to punish Kucha's pro-Turk stance by <b>launching</b> <b>an</b> expedition against the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan that}} Ostojić drew up {{called for the}} Chetniks to remain south of the Neretva to avoid being outflanked by the Partisans. However, this {{essentially}} defensive strategy was rejected by Herzegovinian Chetnik commanders such as Dobroslav Jevđević and Bajo Stanišić, who wished to follow the Axis-led offensive strategy. This placed Ostojić {{in a very difficult}} position, with some of his key detachment commanders following the orders of the Italians rather than his, while the Chetniks were reliant on Italian air and artillery support, particularly around Jablanica. Ostojić subsequently changed his mind and supported the Italian offensive plans, <b>launching</b> <b>an</b> attack against the Partisans retreating from Jablanica to Prozor on 27 February 1943. The attack was indecisive and Ostojić reprimanded the detachment commanders responsible, particularly Stanišić.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Van, {{one of the}} largest cities in Turkish (Western) Armenia, Khrimian became a celibate priest (vardapet) in 1854 {{after the death of his}} wife and daughter. In the 1850s and 1860s he served as the abbot of two {{important}} monasteries in Turkish Armenia: Varagavank near Van and Surb Karapet Monastery near Mush. During this period he established schools and journals in both monasteries. He served as Patriarch of Constantinople—the most influential figure within the Ottoman Armenian community—from 1869 to 1873 and resigned due to pressure from the Ottoman government which saw him as a threat. He was the head of the Armenian delegation at the 1878 Congress of Berlin. Returning from Europe, he encouraged Armenian peasants to follow the example of Christian Balkan peoples by <b>launching</b> <b>an</b> armed struggle for autonomy or independence from the Ottoman Turks.|$|E
5|$|Around {{ten days}} later, the Persian army arrived at Thermopylae, and the Allies at Chalcis were {{informed}} by a ship, captained by Abronichus, {{which had been}} appointed to liaise between {{the army and the}} fleet. However, there was still no sign of the Persian fleet, and the first day the Persians spent at Thermopylae passed without them <b>launching</b> <b>an</b> attack. The next day, the Persian fleet finally drew near to Artemisium, heading for the Gap of Skiathos (between the coast of Magnesia and Skiathos), when a summer gale (a 'Hellesponter' - probably a north-easterly storm) broke, driving the Persian fleet onto the mountainous coast. The storm lasted two days, wrecking approximately one third of the Persian ships. Meanwhile, at Thermopylae, the Persians had continued to wait for the Greeks to disperse, also choosing not to attack during the storm.|$|E

5|$|If {{the player}} wishes {{to take over}} a {{territory}} through diplomatic means, they must initiate dialogue with the local leader. If the player has a high enough popularity, the local leader may invite them to a sporting event, such as elephant race or a game hunting session, which will give the player an opportunity to unite that territory under their faction. If the player's popularity is not high enough, they may hold a Durbar festival in an attempt to impress the local leaders. If diplomacy fails, the player has the option to invade any territory by force. Soldiers can be hired through payments of gold; however, if the player does not have a sufficient amount of gold {{at the end of the}} turn, a rebellion may start. Rebellions will sometimes initiate lethal encounters with assassins, in which the player-character must defend themselves through sword combat. Additionally, the player can bring assassins to their side by successfully <b>launching</b> <b>an</b> attack on their temple. The game will end once either all of the territories are united, or if the player-character is assassinated.|$|E
5|$|In January 1973, {{hope was}} renewed when the Paris Peace Accord was signed, ending the {{conflict}} (for the time being) in South Vietnam and Laos. On 29 January, Lon Nol proclaimed a unilateral cease-fire throughout the nation. All U.S. bombing operations were halted {{in hopes of}} securing a chance for peace. It was not to be. The Khmer Rouge simply ignored the proclamation and carried on fighting. By March, heavy casualties, desertions, and low recruitment had forced Lon Nol to introduce conscription and, in April, insurgent forces launched an offensive that pushed into the suburbs of the capital. The U.S. Air Force responded by <b>launching</b> <b>an</b> intense bombing operation that forced the communists back into the countryside after being decimated by the air strikes. The US Seventh Air Force argued that the bombing prevented the fall of Phnom Penh in 1973 by killing 16,000 of 25,500 Khmer Rouge fighters besieging the city.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to break this {{resistance}} and allow the northwards advance to continue, the Australians attempted to outflank the Japanese defensive line by <b>launching</b> <b>an</b> amphibious landing at Porton Plantation on 8 June. The plan called for a reinforced company from the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion to land behind the Japanese positions and attack from the west, while the main force consisting of {{the remainder of the}} 31st/51st Infantry Battalion and the 26th Infantry Battalion attempted to break through from the south. Due to poor planning, inadequate resources and strong Japanese defence, the landing failed at considerable cost to Australians, and as their efforts turned towards effecting a withdrawal from the beachhead and rescuing the stranded men, the attempt by the main force to break through from Ratsua also failed as tired troops came up against strong Japanese defensive positions.|$|E
