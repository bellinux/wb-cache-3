5|$|The {{first version}} of the script attested is Asomtavruli which dates back to at least the 5th century; the other scripts were formed in the {{following}} centuries. Most scholars link {{the creation of the}} Georgian script to the process of Christianization of Iberia, a core Georgian kingdom of Kartli. The alphabet was therefore most probably created between the conversion of Iberia under King Mirian III (326 or 337) and the Bir el Qutt inscriptions of 430, contemporaneously with the Armenian alphabet. It was first used for translation of the Bible and other Christian literature into Georgian, by monks in Georgia and Palestine. Professor <b>Levan</b> Chilashvili's dating of fragmented Asomtavruli inscriptions, discovered by him at the ruined town of Nekresi, in Georgia's easternmost province of Kakheti, in the 1980s, to the 1st or 2nd century has not been accepted.|$|E
5|$|Feyenoord went {{straight}} to the Group stage of the Champions League after finishing second in the Eredivisie but were eliminated after only winning one game, and finishing six points behind Sparta Prague, and were consequently drawn against SC Freiburg of Germany in the third round of the UEFA Cup. Feyenoord won the first leg 1–0, after a late goal from Shinji Ono. The second leg was drawn 2–2, however Feyenoord came close to going out, as Freiburg took a 2–0 lead on 49 minutes with goals from Sebastian Kehl and <b>Levan</b> Kobiashvili, to make the aggregate score 2–1 in Freiburg's favour. But on 57 minutes, Pierre van Hooijdonk pulled a goal back, to make it 2–2 on aggregate, which would see Feyenoord going through due to the away goal rule. Feyenoord secured their place in the fourth round when Leonardo scored in the 86th minute. Feyenoord faced Rangers of Scotland in the fourth round with the tie proving to be a close affair. The first leg ended 1–1, in Glasgow, Feyenoord had gone ahead on seventy two minutes through Shinji Ono, but Rangers equalised after Peter Løvenkrands was brought down by Glenn Loovens on 81 minutes. Barry Ferguson scored the subsequent penalty. The second leg in Rotterdam ended 3–2 in Feyenoord's favor, the match was notable for the sending off of one player on each side Patrick Paauwe for Feyenoord and Neil McCann for Rangers.|$|E

However, there are no reports in the literature describing growth of G. diazotrophicus in cultures containing sucrose as carbon source. The first step in sucrose pathway and production of <b>levans</b> was investigated. Biomass, <b>levans,</b> gluconic acid and keto gluconic acids production and levansucrase activity were determined in cultures with different sucrose concentration and nitrogen sources. Results: The biomass production was maximal in cultures containing 100 g x L- 1 sucrose and inorganic nitrogen.

40|$|Variation in the {{structures}} of plant fructans and their degree of polymerization (DP) can be explained {{as the result of}} diverse combinations of fructosyltransferases (FTs) with different properties. Although FT genes have been isolated in a range of plant species, sucrose:fructan 6 -fructosyltransferase (6 -SFT) cDNAs have only been functionally characterized in a few species such as wheat. A novel FT cDNA possessing 6 -SFT activity has been identified and characterized from the temperate forage grass, timothy (Phleum pratense L.). The cDNA of an FT homolog, PpFT 1, was isolated from cold-acclimated timothy. A recombinant PpFT 1 protein expressed in Pichia pastoris showed 6 -SFT/sucrose:sucrose 1 -fructosyltransferase (1 -SST) activity and produced linear β(2, 6) -linked <b>levans</b> from sucrose with higher DPs than present in graminans formed in vitro by wheat 6 -SFT (Wft 1). PpFT 1 and Wft 1 showed remarkably different acceptor substrate specificities: PpFT 1 had high affinity for 6 -kestotriose to produce <b>levans</b> and low affinity for 1 -kestotriose, whereas Wft 1 preferentially used 1 -kestotriose as an acceptor. The affinity of the PpFT 1 recombinant enzyme for sucrose as a substrate was lower than that of the Wft 1 recombinant enzyme. It is also confirmed that timothy seedlings had elevated levels of PpFT 1 transcripts during the accumulation of fructans under high sucrose and cold conditions. Our results suggest that PpFT 1 is a novel cDNA with unique enzymatic properties that differ from those of previously cloned plant 6 -SFTs, and is involved in the synthesis of highly polymerized <b>levans</b> in timothy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Streptococcus mutans GS- 5 synthesizes an exo-fl-D-fructosidase, FruA, {{capable of}} {{degrading}} <b>levans,</b> inulins, sucrose and raffinose, {{with the greatest}} activity on <b>levans.</b> A previous analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the FruA protein revealed {{the presence of a}} C-terminus with an LPXTGX membrane sorting sequence and membrane spanning domain, characteristic of many Gram-positive cocci surface proteins. Here it is demonstrated that FruA, which had been previously shown to exist almost exclusively as an extracellular enzyme, can be detected in significant proportions at the surface of S. mutans cells. Moreover, growth of S. mutans GS- 5 at steady state in continuous culture at pH values of 7. 0, 6. 0, or 5. 0 revealed that the amount of cell-associated nzyme increased with decreasing pH values, such that roughly 50 % of the total fructanase activity of pH 5. 0 -grown organisms was cell-associated. This result was confirmed using anti-recombinant-FruA antisera in Western blotting of culture supernate and cell-associated nzyme preparations from chemostat-grown cells. Incubation of S. mutans at pH values of 5. 0, 6. 0 or 7. 0 in buffered media yielded results similar to those observed in the chemostat experiments. The release of FruA from S. mutans was also shown to be inhibitable by copper, which is known to interfere with the release of the surface adhesin, P 1, from intact cells and protoplasts of S. mutans. These data provide evidence for a unique post-translational mechanism for the regulation of the catabolism of polysaccharides by bacteria. The control of degradation of plaque fructans by modulation of the release of the fructanase nzyme from S. mutans may {{play a critical role in}} the temporal and spatial separation of the synthesis and degradation of dental plaque fructans...|$|R
25|$|All 6-carbon sugars and disaccharides {{based on}} 6-carbon sugars can be {{converted}} by dental plaque bacteria into acid that demineralizes teeth, but sucrose may be uniquely useful to Streptococcus sanguinis (formerly Streptococcus sanguis) and Streptococcus mutans. Sucrose is the only dietary sugar that {{can be converted}} to sticky glucans (dextran-like polysaccharides) by extracellular enzymes. These glucans allow the bacteria to adhere to the tooth surface and to build up thick layers of plaque. The anaerobic conditions deep in the plaque encourage the formation of acids, which leads to carious lesions. Thus, sucrose could enable S. mutans, S. sanguinis and many other species of bacteria to adhere strongly and resist removal, e.g. by flow of saliva (although they are easily removed by brushing). The glucans and <b>levans</b> (fructose polysaccharides) produced by the plaque bacteria also act as a reserve food supply for the bacteria.|$|R
40|$|Glycosyltransferase {{activity}} of 13 Leuconostoc mesenteroides strains isolated from Bulgarian fermented vegetables was investigated. All the strains displayed a mucoid phenotype on sucrose-containing agar media. Strains were characterized according to carbohydrate fermentation, species-specific multiple PCR using several primers, repetitive element-PCR fingerprinting using (GTG) (5) primers and glycosyltransferase activity. Level of activity and cellular localization (soluble or cell-associated) were variable among strains. Precipitation of exopolysaccharides produced from sucrose by the soluble fractions from these strains allowed recovery of only glucans and further characterization by H- 1 and C- 13 NMR analysis and enzymatic digestion with dextranase revealed dextran production. However, <b>levans</b> could be detected in presence of raffinose as fructosyl donor. Both fructosyltransferase and glucosyltransferase encoding genes were detected by PCR and both active enzymes were detected after functional characterization by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and in situ polymer production after incubation with sucrose. This work therefore showed that concomitant production of glucosyltransferase and fructosyltransferase is widespread in L. mesenteroides strains...|$|R

40|$|The mitogenicity of dextrans, <b>levans</b> {{and some}} of their depolymerized {{fractions}} was assayed in vitro using spleen cells from CBA mice and compared with their immunogenic and tolerogenic potency in vivo.

The activity of B 1355 was greater than that of B 1299 and induced a level of stimulation similar to that of polyanions (dextran sulphate and polystyrene sulphonic acid). Dextrans B 1355 and B 1299 were relatively poor tolerogens for the α 1 – 6 glucosyl epitope whilst the native linear dextran B 512 was much more effective. Their immunogenicity for this specificity also decreased in the order B 512, B 1355, B 1299.

Tolerance to TI antigens like dextran represents a direct effect on the antigenspecific B cells and the participation of suppressor cells has been excluded (3). It has been suggested that B lymphocytes are tolerized when the Ig receptors bind the antigen (signal 1) {{in the absence of a}} second signal (4). Here we will show that specific immunological tolerance only affects a particular subset of B lymphocytes, whereas other B cells having the same immunological specificity are neither activated nor tolerized by interacting with the antigen.
