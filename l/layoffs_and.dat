40|$|This article investigates {{causes and}} {{characteristics}} of urban <b>layoff</b> <b>and</b> unemployment. Chinese statistics show that the worsening urban unemployment problem is mainly caused by China's institutional changes, sectoral shifts, and cyclical fluctuations.

This article also discusses policy issues of China's urban <b>layoff</b> <b>and</b> unemployment. Supply-side policies include those that expand education, establish job-training programs, limit massive rural-urban migration in the short run, and rationalize labor force participation rate. Demand-side policies aim to create jobs, including policies such as promoting the service industry, attracting foreign investment, and developing the nonstate economy.

25|$|Due to {{competition}} from low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines and increased labor costs {{resulting from a}} new contract with employees represented by the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA) labor union, Northwest began to make cutbacks in early 2001. Two small rounds of employee <b>layoffs</b> <b>and</b> other cutbacks were implemented in the {{months prior to the}} September 11 terrorist attacks. Following the attacks, Northwest was forced to make dramatic changes to its business structure through major employee <b>layoffs</b> <b>and</b> other cost cutting measures. The retirement of costly and aging aircraft such as the Boeing 727 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10-40 were accelerated as new aircraft went into service. In addition, the airline pursued options to reduce costs across the board, including removing pillows, peanuts, pretzels, in-flight entertainment on domestic flights, and newspapers and magazines. Over 50 McDonnell Douglas DC-9, Boeing 757, Boeing 747, and Airbus A320 family aircraft were withdrawn from use in an attempt to lower overall capacity and save money.

40|$|This paper derives {{an optimal}} job-searching {{strategy}} for workers on <b>layoff,</b> <b>and</b> an optimal recall policy for firms, when each side anticipates the other side's actions correctly.

Through the use of optimal job searching and recall policies, the paper derives expressions {{for the duration of}} <b>layoff</b> unemployment <b>and</b> discusses briefly their comparative-static properties...|$|R
