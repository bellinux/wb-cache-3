5|$|Andula is {{a working-class}} young woman {{living in a}} fading Czech factory town, where, due to an {{oversight}} in central state planning, women outnumber men 16–1. The film opens with an intimate scene between Andula and her fellow shoe-factory-worker friend as they <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> in their dormitory discussing the ring given to Andula by her boyfriend Tonda and gossiping about her mildly flirtatious encounter with a forest ranger, which is shown in flashback.|$|E
5|$|The poet W. H. Auden {{taught for}} {{three years in the}} 1930s at The Downs School, in the Malvern Hills. He wrote many poems there, including: This Lunar Beauty; Let Your Sleeping Head; My Love, Fish in the Unruffled Lakes; and Out on the Lawn I <b>Lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>Bed.</b> He also wrote the long poem about the hills and their views, called simply The Malverns.|$|E
500|$|Andula strikes up a flirtation with Milda, the big-city pianist of {{the band}} {{providing}} the music. He reads her palm and instructs her in how to rebuff unwanted advances with {{a kick in the}} shins. After the party she goes to bed with Milda, although the comic frustrations continue, with Milda fighting a battle with a window shade that won't close, before he feels secure in making love. Afterward, as they <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> together, Andula asks what Milda meant when he said she was [...] "angular". He replies that a woman is shaped like a guitar: [...] "And you, you look like a guitar too", he tells her, [...] "but one painted by Picasso." [...] Before they part, he offhandedly invites her to come to Prague and pay him a visit sometime.|$|E

500|$|From 1842 onwards, Chopin {{showed signs}} of serious illness. After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzymała: [...] "I have to <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much." [...] He was forced by illness to decline a written {{invitation}} from Alkan {{to participate in a}} repeat performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Érard's on 1 March 1843. Late in 1844, Charles Hallé visited Chopin and found him [...] "hardly able to move, bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain", although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor. Chopin's health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this time onwards. Modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1990s Hordern was concentrating more on television. His roles were mostly those of ageing teachers, bank managers, {{politicians}} and clergymen. In 1989 he appeared alongside John Mills in {{an adaptation of}} Kingsley Amis's Ending Up, a tale {{about a group of}} pensioners growing old together in a residential home. [...] After that he took the part of Godfrey Colston in Memento Mori, a television film about a group of elderly friends succumbing to old age, which was adapted for television from the Muriel Spark novel of the same name. The film received excellent notices [...] and Hordern's performance was described as outstanding by the critic Neil Sinyard. All that was required of Hordern in his next role, the wealthy but terminally ill landowner Peter Featherstone in the BBC adaptation Middlemarch, was for him simply to <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> and pretend to die. It was the kind of role which he found to be most fitting for someone of his advanced years and confirmed to him that the older he got, the more typecast he became. It was a situation that did not altogether bother him as he felt grateful for being employable at the age of 81.|$|E
500|$|Steiger {{suffered}} from depression {{throughout much of}} his life. He described himself as [...] "incapacitated for about eight years with clinical depression" [...] before his Oscar win for In The Heat of the Night. His career problems from the 1970s onwards were often exacerbated by health issues. He underwent open-heart surgery in 1976 and 1979 and struggled with obesity, though certain roles, such as Napoleon, required him to intentionally gain weight. After the decline of his third marriage in 1979, a deep depression, partly {{a side effect of}} his surgery, during the 1980s negatively affected his career. He became increasingly reclusive during this period, often confining himself to his apartment, watching American football for several hours. He said of the experience: [...] "You begin to lose self-esteem. You don't walk, you don't shave and if no one was watching you'd go to the bathroom right where you were sitting". He would <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> at night thinking [...] "You'll never act again. Why bother? You're no good". Despite these challenges, Steiger continued to act into the 1990s and early 2000s. In one of his final interviews, he stated that there was a stigma wrongfully attached to sufferers of depression and that it was caused by a chemical imbalance, not a mental disease. He commented: [...] "Pain must never be a source of shame. It's a part of life, it's part of humanity." ...|$|E

Neale was apparently so ill that {{he was unable to}} campaign during the [...] and yet increased his majority. This prompted a telegram from Sir Clifton Webb, Attorney-General that stated that [...] "apparently it was better to <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> than lie on the platform".|$|E
2500|$|Eden himself {{paid tribute}} to his wife's {{adaptation}} of their domestic arrangements to meet the [...] "unsteady requirements" [...] of this period, noting that his digestion took less kindly to them. There is some evidence also that, when he was Foreign Secretary, Lady Avon had influenced (or, at any rate endorsed) his patterns of work. A later Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, has observed that, though he worked hard, Eden did not keep office hours and often spent mornings working in bed. For example, on 29 December 1952, Eden wrote: [...] "Raining and cold. Clarissa says {{that this is the}} right way to run the F.O. <b>Lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> direct office by telephone and read Delacroix".|$|E
2500|$|Remarkably, Bore {{found the}} middle of the bat time and again, and when the last over started, another 14 runs were needed. Stephen Booth bowled the first ball of the season's last over and Bore scored a boundary. [...] The second ball went to the ropes again, and the third went for two runs. [...] Nottinghamshire needed four more runs from three balls to {{complete}} a remarkable win. Bore blocked the fourth ball and Andy Pick, Nottinghamshire's number 11, walked down the pitch to ask [...] "What did you do that for?" [...] "It wasn't in the right place." [...] Bore replied. The next delivery saw Bore launch a blow towards the stands. [...] The crowd and the entire Nottingham team were on their feet and Bore thought, as soon as he'd hit it, [...] "That's it, we've won". However Somerset's Richard Ollis ran in and caught the ball above his head, just ten feet from the boundary. [...] Nottinghamshire had lost by three runs and Bore's innings had been in vain. [...] As Bore related in an interview with Simon Lister [...] "We were stunned. We got in the car and I don't think we spoke a word until we were well past Gloucester. No matter how many times I <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> and replay that ball I never score those four runs".|$|E

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of books (including both of Guralnick's books) on Presley contain details of his many romances and alleged affairs including many while {{he was married to}} Priscilla. It has also been reported that Presley [...] "adored to fondle and suck women's toes, and those in his entourage who were given the job of choosing companions for him would often be asked to check the girls' feet." [...] However, according to Alan Fortas, an all-Memphis football halfback who became a bodyguard and part of the Presley entourage, [...] "Elvis needed someone to baby more than he needed a sex partner. He craved the attention of someone who adored him without the threat of sexual pressure, much as a mother would." [...] Furthermore, [...] "Elvis befriended some of the young girls who used to cluster adoringly in his driveway, or outside the fence ... Some of the girls were as young as fourteen. Fortas said they were frequent houseguests who attended his concerts as part of 'Elvis's personal traveling show.' Out in the backyard, they romped with Elvis in the Doughboy pool and challenged him to watermelon-seed spitting contests. They also slipped into his bedroom ... for rambunctious pillow fights. Sometimes they would all sit cross-legged with him on the bed, flipping through his fan magazines or admiring his stuffed-animal collection. Often they would all lie down together and cuddle. But what went on was horseplay, not foreplay." [...] Therefore, Guralnick writes that for [...] "the more experienced girls it wasn't like with other Hollywood stars or even with other more sophisticated boys they knew." [...] Although they offered to do things for Presley, [...] "he wasn't really interested. What he liked to do was to <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> and watch television and eat and talk all night..." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Glenn Jones {{was born}} on September 12, 1931 in Saratoga, Texas, and was raised in Colmesneil, Texas, with his brother and five sisters. His father, George Washington Jones, worked in a {{shipyard}} and played harmonica and guitar while his mother, Clara, played piano in the Pentecostal Church on Sundays. During his delivery, {{one of the doctors}} dropped Jones and broke his arm. When he was seven, his parents bought a radio and he heard country music for the first time. [...] Jones recalled to Billboard in 2006 that he would <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> with his parents on Saturday nights listening to the Grand Ole Opry and insist that his mother wake him if he fell asleep so he could hear Roy Acuff or Bill Monroe. [...] In his autobiography I Lived To Tell It All, Jones explains that the early death of his sister Ethel spurred on his father's drinking problem and, by all accounts, George Washington Jones could be physically and emotionally abusive to his wife and children when he drank. [...] In the book George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend, Bob Allen recounts how George Washington Jones would return home {{in the middle of the}} night with his cronies roaring drunk, wake up a terrified George Glenn Jones and demand that he sing for them or face a beating. [...] In a CMT episode of Inside Fame dedicated to Jones' life, country music historian Robert K. Oermann marveled, [...] "You would think that it would make him not a singer, because it was so abusively thrust on him. [...] But the opposite happened; he became a chronic singer. [...] He became someone who had to sing." [...] In the same program, Jones admitted that he remained ambivalent and resentful towards his father up until the day he died and observed in his autobiography [...] "The Jones family makeup doesn't sit well with liquor...Daddy was an unusual drinker. [...] He drank to excess but never while working, and he probably was the hardest working man I've ever known." [...] His father bought him his first guitar at age nine and he learned his first chords and songs at church and there are several photographs of a young George busking on the streets of Beaumont.|$|E
