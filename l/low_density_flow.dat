Both double-cone and Edney’s type IV shock interaction simulations show that the DSMC errors depend on the Knudsen number and the models employed for intermolecular interaction. With the increase in the Knudsen number, the DSMC error is decreased. The error is the smallest in HS compared with those in the VHS and VSS models. When the Knudsen number is in the level of 10 − 4, the DSMC errors, for pressure coefficient, the Stanton number, and the scale of interaction region, are controlled within 10 %...|$|E

The consequences of the relaxation of these assumptions include the underestimation of the magnitude of a temperature maximum occurring near the freezing-in radius.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to validate the numerical results generated for an argon/helium gas co-flow in a rarefied environment and to present images of a rocket nozzle plume boundary in background pressures ranging from a correctly-matched nozzle static pressure condition to a moderate vacuum. The experiments provided visualisation of ideal and under-expanded plume shapes for the various background pressures. Plume flow experiments {{were conducted}} at the Australian Defence Force Academy where a shock tube was modified to a Ludwieg tube and coupled with a test section, pump and dump tank. An argon gas delivery system was devised to achieve the flow requirements of the experiment. Visualisation of the jet was conducted with a schlieren system and pitot pressure probe results for the argon jet and helium plume were obtained. A numerical plume prediction methodology was employed to obtain approximate plume boundaries for the quiescent and co-flow tests. The results were overlaid on the experimental results. Good agreement was obtained for the ideal and slightly under-expanded conditions. Numerical studies {{were conducted to}} evaluate the correct boundary conditions for plume flow regions of interest in both the co-flow and stationary atmosphere conditions. Regions of noncontinuum flow were identified with Birds breakdown parameter and a numerical method for <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>flow</b> was employed. Correlation of {{the results for the}} experimental and numerical plume boundaries was achieved for the ideal and the underexpanded cases. Separation of the external boundary layer was identified as altering the pressure in the aft region of the rocket. The numerical methodology employed to correlate plume boundary visualisation for an experimental model of a rocket plume inserted in a quiescent and co-flow environment was utilised for flow not significantly removed from equilibrium. Regions of nonequilibrium flow were identified and designated as requiring a suitable numerical method for rarefied flows. The plume boundary data obtained from the experimental and computational results was used to model elevated Knudsen number wedge flow with the Modified Moment Method of Myong.

40|$|Sudden {{compression}} {{of a gas}} flow due to shock reflection from a solid wall or sudden expansion due to an abrupt withdrawal of a piston from the gas are often associated with a phenomenon known generically as wall overheating. Conventional shock-capturing numerical methods accurately pre-dict pressure and velocity, but over-predict temperature at the wall, hence the name. We propose a new shock-capturing method that completely eliminates the wall overheating, while correctly predicting the whole flow field. The method uses: (a) the Lagrangian coordinates, (b) the shock-adaptive Godunov scheme and, (c) the entropy conservation equation in the smooth flow region. Furthermore, the new method also overcomes other computational difficulties commonly encountered by conventional shock-capturing methods, namely, the start-up errors, slow-moving shocks, <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>flows,</b> and the sonic point glitch.

40|$|In {{a former}} paper {{by the present}} author, the effects of {{rarefaction}} were evaluated on the Shock Wave/Boundary Layer Interaction, in hypersonic, <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>flow.</b> The flow field on a flat plate, on which an external, oblique shock wave impinges, was simulated by the direct simulation Monte Carlo code DS 2 V. The test conditions were those that should be met by the Italian Flight Test Bed (FTB-X) vehicle along the re-entry path in the altitude interval 55 - 75 km. The study was carried out {{as a function of}} altitude in order to quantify the effects of both rarefaction and Mach number, or intensity of the shock wave, on: extension of the interaction region, heat flux, aerodynamic load, slip velocity, slip temperature. As expected, the extension of the interaction region increased with rarefaction. The maximum values of heat flux and aerodynamic load in the interaction region were about one order of magnitude higher than the same quantities without shock wave impingement and were even comparable with those on the flat plate leading edge. In the present paper, that can be considered as a logical extension of the above mentioned paper, the effects of rarefaction are quantified on the Shock Wave/Shock Wave Interaction. More specifically, the experimental apparatus in the hypersonic wind tunnel R 5 Ch at Office National d’Etude et de Recherches Aérospatiales (ONERA) is simulated by DS 2 V. This apparatus is made up of a wedge generating an oblique shock wave impinging on a bow shock generated by a circular cylinder with axis normal to the free stream. The test conditions are those already used in the above mentioned paper. These conditions are such that the Edney’s “type IV” interaction is produced. This type of interactions is the most severe shock wave/shock wave interaction. The increases of heat flux and pressure produced by interaction, with respect to the case with no interaction, range from 1. 8 to 7. 3 and from 2. 5 to 7. 8 in the above mentioned altitude interval, respectively. These increases are lower than those produced by the Shock Wave/Boundary Layer Interaction on the flat plate, using the same free stream conditions and the same wedge angle generating the oblique shock wave; those increases ranged from 5. 9 to 11. 8 and from 8. 9 to 18. 1, respectively. The extension of the interaction region, {{as a function of the}} free stream parameters, has been quantified and the effects of wall catalyticity have been also evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Bulk {{metallic}} glasses (BMGs) offer {{a great deal}} of potential through their near-theoretical strength, potentially high toughness and unique forming and molding traits. However, there are still a number of outstanding issues that bar their widespread use. This thesis describes the investigation of three research questions each designed to further the scientific community's understanding of BMGs. First, the strong fatigue properties of Zr₅₂. ₅CU₁₇. ₉Ni₁₄. ₆Al₁₀Ti₅ BMG were explored {{as a function of the}} ambient environment by testing in ambient air (20 to 40 % relative humidity) and a dry inert nitrogen environment. It was found that in both environments Zr₅₂. ₅CU₁₇. ₉Ni₁₄. ₆Al₁₀Ti₅ exhibited a relatively high fatigue threshold of ~ 2 MPa√m and lacked the environmentally influenced stress insensitive fatigue crack growth rate plateaus observed in other Zr-based BMGs tested in ambient air. Additionally, the author hypothesized that the root cause of the fatigue plateaus in Zr-based BMGs is a reactive species in the ambient air, though not water itself. Second, the effect of sample size upon the fracture properties of BMGs was explored. SE(B) and C(T) BMG test samples of composition Zr₅₂. ₅CU₁₇. ₉Ni₁₄. ₆Al₁₀Ti₅ and varying un-cracked ligament sizes were tested. It was found that all samples that conformed to the K[subscript IC] standards found in ASTM E 399 regardless of un-cracked ligament size had statistically similar values of K[subscript IC]. However, comparing these results to samples only conforming to the J-integral standards found in ASTM E 1820 showed higher values of K[subscript J] by a statistically significant margin. Additionally, sub-sized samples (those which did not conform to either K[subscript IC] or J-integral requirements) were found to show an increase in conditional stress intensity factor, K[subscript Q]. These results are of particular interest as they are in contrast to reported results for crystalline metals. It was concluded that there are no size effects in samples that conform to the K[subscript IC] standards; however, size does affect results for samples analyzed by the J-integral method. The author hypothesized that the size dependence of the J-integral method is the result of the strain softening behavior of BMGs which is in contrast to the strain hardening behavior expected in the J-integral method. Additionally, the author hypothesized that the increase in K[subscript Q] in sub-sized samples is the result of the size dependent plasticity reported for BMGs at small sample sizes. Finally, the mechanical effect of the slow β relaxation in BMGs was explored. Au₄₉Ag₅. ₅Pd₂. ₃Cu₂₆. ₉Si₁₆. ₃ BMG samples were tested by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), isothermal aging near the slow β relaxation temperature and compression testing. The results of DMA testing revealed the slow β relaxation temperature for Au₄₉Ag₅. ₅Pd₂. ₃Cu₂₆. ₉Si₁₆. ₃ to be ~ 50 ºC. Isothermal aging revealed that at the slow β relaxation temperature, two specific effects are taking place; an initial quick drop in elastic modulus followed by a slow rise in elastic modulus. Compression testing was performed using as-cast and heat treated samples at a minimum observed elastic modulus. These compression tests revealed a statistically insignificant decrease in compressive strength with heat treatment. The author hypothesized that the microscopic cause of the two phase slow β relaxation is similar to a previously reported process in silicate oxide glass. The author hypothesized that the two phases corresponded to; first, the <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>flow</b> units in the BMG spontaneously collapsing, locally stressing the surrounding high density matrix, second, with continued thermal energy, the local stresses being uniformly released into the collapsed flow unit, stressed matrix and surrounding high density matrix allowing the BMG to microscopically form shear transformation zones. These results and hypothesis hope to further the understanding of BMGs and enhance their use in scientific, commercial and industrial applications...|$|E

40|$|We present {{numerical}} {{evidence of}} dynamic star formation {{in which the}} accreted stellar mass grows superlinearly with time, roughly as $t^ 2 $. We perform simulations of star formation in self-gravitating hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence that is continuously driven. By turning the self-gravity of the gas in the simulations on or off, we demonstrate that self-gravity is the dominant physical effect setting the mass accretion rate at early times before feedback effects take over, contrary to theories of turbulence-regulated star formation. We find that gravitational collapse steepens the density profile around stars, generating the power-law tail on what is otherwise a lognormal density probability distribution function. Furthermore, we find turbulent velocity profiles to flatten inside collapsing regions, altering the size-linewidth relation. This local flattening reflects enhancements of turbulent velocity on small scales, as verified by changes to the velocity power spectra. Our results indicate that gas self-gravity dynamically alters both density and velocity structures in clouds, giving rise to a time-varying star formation rate. We find that a substantial fraction of the gas that forms stars arrives via <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>flows,</b> as opposed to accreting through high density filaments.

40|$|Recent {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} MHD turbulence, under very different driving conditions, and by several different investigators, all indicate a {{sensitivity of the}} rms fluctuations to {{the ratio of the}} microscopic viscosity to resistivity. This dimensionless quantity is known as the magnetic Prandtl number Pm. In general, standard astrophysical accretion disks are characterized by Pm ≪ 1 throughout their radial extent, while low luminosity accretors (e. g. Sag A*) have Pm ≫ 1. Here, we show that standard α models of black hole accretion disks have a transition radius, measured in tens of Schwarzschild radii, at which the flow goes from Pm ≪ 1 to Pm ≫ 1. Moreover, this transition may well be dynamically unstable, leading to a sort of two-phase "Prandtl number medium" We advance the idea that this is the physical reason underlying the change in the accretion properties of the inner regions of Keplerian disks, leading to a truncation of the cool disk (Pm ≪ 1) and the onset of hot, <b>low</b> <b>density</b> gas <b>flow</b> (Pm ≫ 1). © 2008 Elsevier B.

The solutions are parameterized by the ratio of the mass of the accreting gas to the central object mass and the viscosity coefficient. While the density and the pressure are obtained simply by solving a set of ordinary differential equations, the radial and the rotational velocities are presented analytically. Profiles of the density and the rotational velocities show two distinct features. <b>Low</b> <b>density</b> outer accreting <b>flow</b> with relatively flat rotation velocity, surrounds an inner high density region. In the inner part, the rotational velocity increases from the center to a transition radius where separates the inner and outer portions...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} two <b>low</b> <b>density</b> {{polyethylene}} melt <b>flows</b> in slit coextrusion flow cells with 30 ° and 90 ° confluent geometries is presented. The stream flows and polymer-polymer interface in the confluent region and die land are observed through side {{windows of the}} cell. Birefringence and image processing techniques are used to quantify stress and velocity fields in the upstream and down stream melt flows. Interfacial instabilities were observed in the LDPE melt flows in both geometries. Instabilities occurred at certain stream mass flow ratios. Digital image processing shows the wave type extrudate instabilities have the same periodicity as perturbation in the flow field in the die land. A recently proposed "TNSD sign criterion" reasonably predicted {{the onset of the}} interfacial instabilities in these die geometries...|$|R
