50|$|In February 2007, Ely {{released}} Happy Songs From Rattlesnake Gulch {{on his own}} <b>label,</b> <b>Rack</b> 'Em Records. Ely said in {{an interview}} with Country Standard Time that he thought it would be easier to release the material on his own label instead of dealing with a regular record label and their release cycles. A book of Ely's writings, Bonfire of Roadmaps, was published in early 2007 by the University of Texas Press. In early 2008, Ely released a new live album featuring Joel Guzman on accordion recorded at the Cactus Cafe in Austin, Texas late 2006.|$|E
30|$|The 8 display node PCs in the <b>rack</b> (<b>labeled</b> as DN A 1 through DN D 2) {{as shown}} in Fig. 3.F. 1 are {{connected}} to the Hiperwall display-tiles (one display node for each display tile). Each display node consists of a display device that is driven by a PC (mini-tower or rack-mount) running the Hiperwall software. The Hiperwall software runs as an application operating on a standard PC connected via a standard 1 Gbps network switch. Hiperwall’s tiled display system software architecture applies parallel processing techniques to overcome the performance limitations typically associated with the display of large multiple images on multiple display devices (flat-panel tiles) at once. A display node software receives content over a 1 Gbps network switch from a sender or a streamer node and projects it on the display wall tile via a HDMI cable. All display-node computers work in parallel, thus giving flexibility and scalability while also allowing the user to place contents on one or more multiple display-tiles all at once.|$|R
30|$|The minimum {{inhibitory}} concentration of the honeys was determined using broth tube dilution method according to Kacaniova et al. (2011) procedure. Briefly, ten sterile test tubes were placed in <b>rack,</b> <b>labeled</b> each 1 through 8. Honey control tube (HC) and growth control tube (GC) were used as a quality control. One ml of freshly prepared nutrient broth was added to each tube, sterilized and cooled. Then one ml of undiluted honey solution 100  % was added to test tube number 1 and HC with a sterile micropipette and tips. Then twofold serial dilution was performed by transferring 1  ml undiluted honey into the second tube with separate sterile micropipette and tips and vortexed for homogenization. After a through mixing, 1  ml was transferred with another sterile micropipette from tube 2 and tube 3. These procedures continued until eighth tube with a dilution of 1 : 128 was reached and finally 1  ml was taken and discarded from tube 8. The GC tube received no honey was served as a growth control while the HC tube received no bacterial inoculums was served as a honey control.|$|R
40|$|Labels {{are used}} for {{managing}} warehouse environments by collecting information from existing items on shelves and <b>racks.</b> <b>Labels</b> enable description and identification of items accurately in a short time. Although lot of research {{have been done in}} the field of barcode detection, the present methods for detection are applicable at a short distance from the camera and with a clear background. Therefore, label detection from captured images is challenging especially with a large and complex background. Once a label is detected, it is ready for next process of recognition, to read out the stored information in texts and barcodes. In this thesis, we compared methods from previous works and implemented the most suitable one for detecting one-dimensional (1 D) barcodes available on the captured images by standard lens. We created a dataset for label detection with an assumption on background color and we continued processing by K-means clustering and classification. After localizing label regions, a projection for determining a different candidate area is done. We have worked on two types of barcodes, one-dimensional (1 D) and Data Matrix as a two-dimensional (2 D) barcode. The results show a good performance of the system in terms of images, which are the most important issue in terms of industrial detection. ...|$|R
