25|$|She <b>likes</b> <b>that.</b> - Buri ne ita.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{book that}} contradicts itself a hundred times; {{but that is not}} a {{criticism}} of it, because its author thinks contradictions are a sign of intellectual ferment and vitality. This {{is a book}} that systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; but that is not a criticism, because its author thinks that all interpretations are biased, and she regards it as her duty to pick and choose her facts to favor her own brand of politics. This is a book full of vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; but that is not a criticism, because the author <b>likes</b> <b>that</b> sort of prose and has taken lessons in how to write it, and she thinks that plain, homely speech is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor.|$|E

Danny takes a shine to Jacqui and they share a couple of dates; during an interview Day brands Danny's attraction to Danny being down to her feisty manner adding: [...] "Jacqui stands up to him, and even though he's not used to it, I think he likes it. He's quite intrigued by the fact that she's so feisty and he <b>likes</b> <b>that</b> edginess about her." ...|$|E

500|$|Charles Peale {{recorded}} family births on the flyleaf of {{a copy of}} Matthew Pilkington's Dictionary of Painters, {{rather than}} in a Bible, and after recording [...] "Aldrovand" [...] added the notation, [...] "if he <b>likes</b> <b>that</b> name when he comes of age". The father {{was a member of the}} American Philosophical Society, and in February 1796 brought his young son to a meeting, and asked the members to select another name for the child. [...] They decided on Benjamin Franklin Peale, naming the boy after the Society's founder, Benjamin Franklin. [...] Society legend holds that the boy was given the name while placed in the chair of the president of the Society, which had been donated by Franklin.|$|E
500|$|Differing with Dr. Johnson, {{who found}} nothing of genius in Henry VIII but the {{depiction}} of the meek sorrows and virtuous distress of Queen Katherine, Hazlitt finds in this play, though not one of Shakespeare's greatest, [...] "considerable interest of a more mild and thoughtful cast, {{and some of the}} most striking passages in the author's works." [...] In addition to the portrayal of Katherine, Hazlitt <b>likes</b> <b>that</b> of Cardinal Wolsey and of King Henry himself, which, though [...] "drawn with great truth and spirit [...] like a very disagreeable portrait, sketched by the hand of a master." [...] And [...] "the scene of [...] Buckingham led to execution {{is one of the most}} affecting and natural in Shakespear, and one to which there is hardly an approach in any other author." ...|$|E
500|$|Engadgets Devindra Hardawar {{wrote that}} iOS 10 is Apple [...] "basically {{polishing}} a pearl". Hardawar {{noted that the}} {{major changes in the}} release focus on features rather than the visual interface. He wrote that the lock screen is now [...] "far more customizable than before". He praised the new features added to 3D Touch, writing that it [...] "finally feels useful", where he <b>likes</b> <b>that</b> [...] "3D Touch works in almost every part of the OS". In regard to iMessage, he wrote that it has new features that are [...] "particularly useful", including [...] "Invisible ink" [...] that obscures text in a conversation when others might be looking, but criticized the user interface, writing that it [...] "needs some work". The [...] "Memories" [...] feature in the new Photos app [...] "usually turned out well", but wrote that [...] "they're still clearly a work in progress". Hardawar praised the new Apple Music app, but added that [...] "really, anything is better than the last iteration". He also liked lyrics support. He wrote that Siri's third-party support was [...] "actually starting to get useful", but did run into accuracy issues. He finished by writing that although iOS 10 does add features seen in Google's Android operating system before, the mobile industry is [...] "shamelessly getting [...] "inspired" [...] by the competition". His summary states that [...] "iOS 10 is a collection of useful changes to an already solid OS".|$|E

2500|$|In sharp contrast, the {{founding}} publisher {{and editor of}} Poetry, Harriet Monroe, emphasized the folksy New England persona and characters in Frost's work, writing that [...] "perhaps no other poet in our history has put {{the best of the}} Yankee spirit into a book so completely." [...] She notes his frequent use of rural settings and farm life, and she <b>likes</b> <b>that</b> in these poems, Frost is most interested in [...] "showing the human reaction to nature's processes." [...] She also notes that while Frost's narrative, character-based poems are often satirical, Frost always has a [...] "sympathetic humor" [...] towards his subjects.|$|E

2500|$|Author Simone {{commented on}} the new lineup, saying that each {{character}} provided a foil for the two others: [...] "In this case, Babs and Dinah respect each other tremendously, and each is capable of great things the other is not. Dinah's not just Oracle's legs, sometimes, she's her conscience, or her muse, or just her best friend. And Oracle is far more to Dinah than just the mission controller. They trust each other, and out of that, there's a friendship that they believe in. Huntress...I see Helena {{as someone who is}} not a loner completely by choice. Dinah is so accepting and so open that Helena sees an opportunity to be part of something without having to force her way in. There's friction, because once Helena puts the mask on, she's really not very good fitting in. But she <b>likes</b> <b>that</b> they're giving her a chance. Whether she blows it or not, you'll have to keep reading." ...|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} karmas provide different {{abilities of}} tastes to the bodies: tikta rasa nama-karma gives a bitter taste (<b>like</b> <b>that</b> of the nimba fruit), kasaya rasa nama-karma gives an astringent taste (<b>like</b> <b>that</b> of bibhitaka), amla rasa nama-karma gives a sour taste (<b>like</b> <b>that</b> of tamarind) and madhura rasa nama-karma gives a sweet taste (<b>like</b> <b>that</b> of sugar). The salt taste {{is produced by}} a combination of the sweet taste with another. Bitter and biting tastes are considered unpleasant, the others pleasant.|$|R
2500|$|The {{character}} was created as {{the sister of}} established character, Brooke Freeman (Beth Allen) due to Blampied's and Allen's physical similarity. Bree first appeared on the show when Vinnie Kruse (Pua Magasiva) mistook her for his girlfriend – Brooke. Although Bree tried {{to get on with}} Brooke, the feelings were not mutual and Brooke struggled to accept her sister. Whilst the two characters were getting to know each other, so too were their actresses; Blampied and Beth Allen and the two shared a dressing room. Blampied herself was an only child, but found working alongside Allen reassuring, [...] "I was kind of getting to know Beth in an almost sisterly way at the same time Bree and Brooke were getting to know each other. So it's kind of worked for me." [...] After Vinnie left Brooke for her behaviour towards Bree, he and Bree started an affair, creating a love triangle between the sisters. Bree revealed to Vinnie that her qualifications as a surgeon were dodgy and alerted Brooke. However instead of deepening the rival between the two, it only forced the two closer together. Blampied explained the situation stating; [...] "Instead of throwing Bree under a bus, Brooke decides she quite <b>likes</b> <b>that</b> Bree has a big secret, because it makes her more human – or more like she is ... Brooke decides she is going to take Bree under her wing and help her out of the mess. In many ways Bree becomes Brooke's little protege. I think they've both had the chance to let their guard down with one another. Now that Brooke has seen Bree at her lowest – desperate and vulnerable – it has endeared her to Brooke." ...|$|E
