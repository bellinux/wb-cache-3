25|$|Cut-offs are {{homemade}} shorts made {{by cutting}} the legs off trousers, usually after holes have been worn in fabric around the knees. This extends {{the useful life}} of the trousers. The remaining <b>leg</b> <b>fabric</b> may be hemmed or left to fray after being cut.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the stuffed}} animals, another {{successful}} Popple-themed line of merchandise was Pocket Popples. Based on same characters as the larger Popples they were scaled {{to fit in}} a pocket. They had PVC faces, articulated arms and <b>legs,</b> and <b>fabric</b> features of ears, tails and pocket (where they hid).|$|R
50|$|Kachchhi Ghodi {{includes}} a combined performance by dancers, singers and musicians. In Rajasthan, the dance is performed by men {{dressed in a}} kurta and a turban, along with an imitation horse costume. The shell of the costume is constructed out of papier-mâché molded to resemble a horse supported by a bamboo frame. It is then covered with bright colored fabric elaborately designed with mirror-work embroidery known as Shisha. The dummy horse does not have <b>legs.</b> Instead, <b>fabric</b> is draped around the dancer's waist covering {{the entire length of}} his legs. Around the ankles, the dancers wear musical bells known as ghungroo, similar to those worn by Indian classical dancers.|$|R
50|$|High-technology {{swimwear}} {{is designed}} to reduce drag and improve swimming performance. Speedo claims that their LZR Racer reduced drag or water resistance by 38% compared to a traditional Lycra practice swim suit. This high-technology swimwear {{is designed to}} minimize drag while maximizing support to muscles. Some companies claim that their fabrics reduce drag {{even more than the}} water's normal friction against the skin. To do this, they design high-end lines of competitive swimwear that cover the arms and <b>legs.</b> The <b>fabric</b> used for high-technology swimwear is light and water-repellent. The material is often composed of highly stretchy spandex and nylon. High-technology swimwear is often made using bonded seams, to reduce further drag. These suit also provide the compression necessary to increase performance.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{properties}} (diffusivity {{and heat}} capacity) at varying temperatures up to 200 °C and the thermal diffusivity under hydrostatic pressures up to 1 GPa {{at room temperature}} were measured on two basaltic samples recovered from Hole 504 B drilled during Ocean Drilling Program <b>Leg</b> 148. Rock <b>fabrics</b> and porosity are key factors controlling the thermal properties of these rock samples. Estimates of thermal conductivities of rocks in situ can {{be made on the}} present results. The estimated val-ues can be compared with those obtained by shipboard measurements, enabling us to eliminate incorrect data. The shipboard measurements of rock samples containing a small amount of water-filled pores give reliable thermal conductivity values. The validity of measuring wet samples also is verified by thermal diffusivities of dried core samples, measured experimentally under hydrostatic pressures...|$|R
40|$|A fabric based {{thermoelectric}} generator with great wearability would overcome the wearable difficulty of existing organic film generators, which shows promising application in flexible and wearable self powered electronic systems by harvesting body heat to generate electricity. However, to fabricate a wearable fabric {{thermoelectric generator}}, yarns with thermoelectric function are indispensable components, since yarns {{are the basic}} composition units of fabric structures, {{which can be treated}} as thermoelectric <b>legs</b> in a <b>fabric</b> thermoelectric generator. Thus, to give thermoelectric function to yarns, a new water-processable thermoelectric coating material made of waterborne polyurethane, MWCNT and PEDOT:PSS composite was developed. The thermoelectric properties of the composite with different constituents were investigated. The optimal electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient could achieve similar to 13826 S/m and similar to 10 mu V/K at room temperature respectively, resulting in a power factor of similar to 1. 41 mu W m(- 1) K- 2. In the following coating experiment, the fabricated composite was successfully coated on commercial cotton and polyester yarns respectively. Compared with the staple cotton yarn, the long continuous polyester filament exhibiting better coating layer is more suitable as coating substrate. The fabricated yarns will be the foundation for our next study of fabric TEG. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
