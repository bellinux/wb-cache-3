5|$|Most Hydrophiinae are {{completely}} aquatic and {{have adapted to}} their environments in many ways, the most characteristic {{of which is a}} paddle-like tail that has improved their swimming ability. To a varying degree, the bodies of many species are laterally compressed, especially in the pelagic species. This has often caused the ventral scales to become reduced in size, even difficult to distinguish from the adjoining scales. Their lack of ventral scales means they have become virtually helpless on land, but as they <b>live</b> <b>out</b> <b>their</b> entire lifecycles at sea, they have no need to leave the water.|$|E

This rationale is supported by most modern historians and reinforced by the ultimate decision of 16 out of 24 of the active mutineers to demand Fletcher return them to Tahiti (despite his rational protestations that it was the last port of call for the Bounty and inevitably the first place the Admiralty would search once word of the mutiny was received or the ship was reported overdue).|$|E

The duration of a contract was typically five to eight years, but many coolies did not <b>live</b> <b>out</b> <b>their</b> term of service due to hard labour and mistreatment. Survivors were often forced to remain in servitude beyond the contracted period. The coolies {{who worked on the}} sugar plantations in Cuba and in the guano beds of the Chincha Islands (the islands of Hell) of Peru were treated brutally. Seventy-five percent of the Chinese coolies in Cuba died before fulfilling their contracts. More than two-thirds of the Chinese coolies who arrived in Peru between 1849 and 1874 died within the contract period. In 1860 it was calculated that of the 4000 coolies brought to the Chinchas since the trade began, not one had survived.|$|E

GameSpot echoed these sentiments, stating Guitar Hero had a [...] "great guitar controller" [...] and [...] "killer soundtrack" [...] and was possibly the [...] "best rhythm game ever made". Many reviews praised the game's gradual learning curve and difficulty approach through the song tier progression and the difficulty setting for each song. Play said the game [...] "gives bedroom air guitarists a chance to <b>live</b> <b>out</b> <b>their</b> rock 'n' roll fantasies". GameSpys review commented {{on the length of}} the songs, in that [...] "once you hit the three minute mark or so, things start to feel 'too long'".

500|$|The monument's three {{divisions}} {{symbolize the}} three [...] "realms" [...] of Buddhist cosmology, namely Kamadhatu (the world of desires), Rupadhatu (the world of forms), and finally Arupadhatu (the formless world). Ordinary sentient beings <b>live</b> <b>out</b> <b>their</b> {{lives on the}} lowest level, the realm of desire. Those who have burnt out all desire for continued existence leave the world of desire {{and live in the}} world on the level of form alone: they see forms but are not drawn to them. Finally, full Buddhas go beyond even form and experience reality at its purest, most fundamental level, the formless ocean of nirvana. The liberation from the cycle of Saṃsāra where the enlightened soul had no longer attached to worldly form corresponds to the concept of Śūnyatā, the complete voidness or the nonexistence of the self. Kāmadhātu is represented by the base, Rupadhatu by the five square platforms (the body), and Arupadhatu by the three circular platforms and the large topmost stupa. The architectural features between the three stages have metaphorical differences. For instance, square and detailed decorations in the Rupadhatu disappear into plain circular platforms in the Arupadhatu to represent how the world of forms—where men are still attached with forms and names—changes into the world of the formless.|$|E

[...] Amaya Rivera, writing about the series for Popmatters, noted: [...] "Indeed, there is something disturbing about the Kardashians' intense hunger for fame.

[...] John Kubicek, the senior writer of BuddyTV, reviewed the premiere of the third season of the show and discussed {{the reason for the}} family's success by saying that: [...] "the Kardashians' fame is a lot like Möbius strip or an M. C. Escher painting." [...] Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described Keeping Up with the Kardashians as a: [...] "Hollywood version of The Brady Bunch -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections". Jessica Chasmar of The Washington Times said that series: [...] "illustrates our nation's moral, spiritual and cultural decay." [...] Chasmar emphasized its negative influence and noted: [...] "America of 50 years ago would regard Ms. Kardashian with a mixture of disdain and pity, embarrassed by the very idea of a young lady's most private moments being broadcast for all the world to see." ...|$|E

The native population has created [...] "kindness centres", where those infected by the plague are placed in one of several thousand accelerated time streams, allowing them to <b>live</b> <b>out</b> <b>their</b> lives whilst in communication with their loved ones through a large glass lens in the waiting room. On their arrival, Amy is separated from the Doctor and Rory, and becomes stuck in an accelerated time stream.

The Handbot explains the plague, and failing to recognise the Doctor or Rory as alien, attempts to administer a dose of medicine that would be fatal. The Doctor uses the glass lens to warn Amy of this, and tells her to wait for him in the kindness centre, promising to rescue her. The Doctor and Rory return to the TARDIS with the glass lens, which the Doctor uses to lock the time machine onto Amy's timestream.

500|$|The South China Morning Post {{praised the}} game's formula, noting that it {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} previous open-ended Maxis games. Comparing to SimCity 2000, the review remarked that it was more interesting to watch people <b>live</b> <b>out</b> <b>their</b> lives in a tower rather than to observe cars moving around. They also appreciated the [...] "homely" [...] feeling of SimTower, in contrast with other Sim games such as SimEarth and SimLife, which they felt were too universal to take on a personal identity. Benjamin Svetkey of Entertainment Weekly praised the game and commented that it is [...] "more fun than [...] sounds". However, he stated that the gameplay may be too much for fans of the series. A reviewer for Next Generation panned the game, saying it lacks the bustling interactivity of previous games in the Sim franchise: [...] "There are bug infestations and the occasional fire with which to deal, but most of the time, SimTower sees you standing around waiting for cash reserves to grow in order to add more floors. Not much fun at all." [...] Australia's The Age found SimTower a pleasing return to form for Maxis, after the release of the disappointing SimFarm. Lisa Karen Savignano of Allgame stated that the game had decent graphics and sound. However, she also felt that SimTower had good replay value due to the non-linear gameplay, giving the game 4 stars out of 5.|$|E
500|$|During one scene, Rosa Lee tells Mac, [...] "I say {{my prayers}} {{for you and}} when I thank the Lord for his tender mercies, you're {{at the head of}} the list." [...] Scholar Robert Jewett compares this line to the first verse of Romans 12, in which Paul the Apostle appeals to Christians to <b>live</b> <b>out</b> <b>their</b> lives in service to others [...] "through the mercies of God". Many of the {{elements}} of Mac's redemption, conversion to Christianity and budding relationship with Rosa Lee occur off-camera, including their wedding. Jewett writes, [...] "This is perfectly congruent with the theme of faith in the hidden mercies of God, the secret plot of the life of faith in Romans.... It is a matter of faith, elusive and intangible." [...] Jewett compares Mac's story to that of Abraham, because [...] "just like Sledge's story, [...] centers on the provision of a future through the tender mercies of God". As told in Romans 4, Abraham and his wife Sarah are too old to produce a son, but Abraham develops the faith that God will provide them an heir, which is exactly what occurs, though—as Paul describes—Abraham did nothing practical to guarantee or deserve such a miracle. Jewett describes Mac as similarly undeserving of redemption, based on his selfish and abusive past, typified by his condition in his first encounter with Rosa Lee: in a drunken stupor following a motel room fight. She takes him in and eventually falls in love with him, despite his having done nothing to deserve her care or his redemption: [...] "It is an undeserved grace, a gift of providence from a simple woman who continues to pray for him and to be grateful for him." ...|$|E
