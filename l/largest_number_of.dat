40|$|The {{statistical}} analysis <b>of</b> a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> rare events, (LNRE), {{which can also}} be called statistical theory of diversity, {{is the subject of}} acute interest both in statistical theory and in numerous applications. A careful eye will quickly see the presence <b>of</b> a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> very rare objects almost everywhere: <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> rare species in ecosystems, <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> rare opinions in any opinion pool, <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> small admixtures in any solution and <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> rare words in any text are only few examples. In studying such objects, the interest for mathematical statisticians {{lies in the fact that}} most of the frequencies are small and, therefore, difficult to deal with. It is not immediately clear how one should be able to derive consistent and reliable inference from a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> such frequencies. In this thesis we study the diversity of questionnaires with multiple answers. It has been demonstrated that this is a particular model of LNRE theory. In our analysis, the theories of large deviation, contiguity and Edgeworth expansion were employed, and limit theorems have been established...|$|R
