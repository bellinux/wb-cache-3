The failure of the <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> led to a loss of lateral load capacity and a low level of ductility from the specimen. Reinforced concrete buildings designed to pre- 1970 s codes may be considered inadequate when viewed in light of the provisions in current codes for seismic design. The testing of beam details taken from one such building indicates insufficient anchorage existed for the plain longitudinal beam bars in the joint. The loss of bond for the plain bars began in the initial load cycles of the test and led to a lack of specimen stiffness and lateral load capacity. The presence of the <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> is considered to have accelerated the loss of bond from the bars. Testing investigating the performance available from plain bar reinforced subassemblages should use anchorage for the bars that represent the conditions in the existing structure.

40|$|AbstractDue to {{the rapid}} {{development}} in design of multistory buildings and, because {{of the variation in}} stories height with the fixed length of the steel reinforcing bars, steel is usually wasted particularly in columns. Hence, compression <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> may be used within the column height in order to avoid such waste in steel reinforcement which necessitates the optimization of this splice length. In the ACI 318 - 11 Provisions, the calculated compression <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> in members with high strength concrete can be longer than tension splice. Hence, an optimization of compression <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> would contribute to significant saving particularly in columns. This paper presents an experimental study to investigate the behavior of compression <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> in circular reinforced concrete columns. The objective of the present investigation is to study the influence of splice length, volume of transverse reinforcement and end bearing condition on the behavior of compression <b>lap</b> <b>splice.</b> The conducted investigation included experimental tests of nine circular columns under uniaxial compression loads. All spliced bars were in contact {{with each other and with}} constant concrete cover. Based on the experimental investigation and test results, concluding remarks have been drawn, based on which a design simplified equation for splice length in compression has been developed. A correlation between the experimental and calculated results of the author specimens and other results available in literature, showed a good agreement. Also, the formulas adapted by different codes for predicting the compression <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length have been checked with the proposed equation...|$|E

The use of mechanical connections configuration and the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> connections were developed in this study. Reviews of research are not only including technical aspects of strength and integrity of structural elements, but also observe the ease of manufacture and implementation. Research program is conducted by reviewing the configuration of lap slice length and the amount of clamp which has been used. The research of connections is reviewed in conditions of bare bar which embedded in concrete beams. The bare bar conditions did as if reinforcement tensile test, which the variable is the number of clamp with a <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> configuration 1 clamp+lap splice 6, 34 db and 2 clamp+lap splice 6, 34 db.

Concrete quality, steel quality, and tightening boults of clamp are fixed variables. The research has resulted clamp force which increased significantly sized up ± 100 % of its number, the most optimum number use 2 clamps, the strength of <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> raise keep up with its length.

40|$|Most {{design codes}} {{encourage}} the staggering of <b>lapped</b> <b>splices</b> in a section, such that {{a portion of}} the bars in the cross section remains continuous throughout the lap zone. A penalty on lap length may be imposed if all bars are lapped at one section. In the literature, however, almost all tested specimens have had all reinforcement lapped at the same section. This paper presents results of tests carried out to shed some new light on the behaviour of <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> where only a portion of bars is lapped. To this end, four point bending tests were carried out on 24 full-scale beams with {{all or part of the}} longitudinal reinforcement <b>lap</b> <b>spliced</b> at mid-span. The beams were reinforced with either 16 or 20 mm diameter rebars, included two grades of concrete and various <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> configurations, all confined by links. All the beams were designed with the same concrete cover and with the minimum amount of transverse reinforcement permitted by MC 2010, equal to 50 % of the area of the lapped bars. The resistance and the residual strength of the splices were measured and compared with the results of specimens with continuous bars and with all bars lapped. The results show that lapping only a portion of bars at a section impairs splice strength, although some post-peak strength is maintained by the continuous bars. These outcomes raise questions over the validity of EC 2 and ACI 318 - 11 provisions which allow a reduction in lap-length when splices are staggered...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been conducted into the areas of low cycle high stress loading (seismic loading) and static loading of reinforced concrete beams containing <b>lap</b> <b>splices.</b> The knowledge acquired from this {{research has}} led to recommendations for changes in how seismic and static loading of <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> are handled. For splices subjected to high cycle low stress load patterns (fatigue loading) current design of <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> is very similar to that used for statically loaded splices, even though little research information is available on performance of <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> under high cycle fatigue, particularly for larger size bars and members.

In the test programme described in this report, only short lap lengths with heavy transverse confinement were investigated. Specimens used in this study were 7 m long with a 330 mm x 508 mm cross-section. Equal loading is applied at two points symmetrically placed two meters apart on the simply supported beam. Reinforcement consists of 2 - No. 30 Grade 400 tension reinforcement with either 2 - No. 30 or 3 - No. 25 Grade 400 compression reinforcement. Both tension bars contain 900 mm <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> confined with 7 - No. 10 Grade 300 stirrups. The splices are located at mid-span in the constant moment, zero-shear region. Shear reinforcement consists of No. 10 Grade 300 stirrups placed at 150 mm on centre. Eight specimens were constructed and subjected to either cyclic loads or monotonically increasing loads (static loads) until failure. Cyclic loads were applied to seven specimens with a monotonically increasing load applied to the eighth. Different load ranges were used in the fatigue testing, but stress reversal was not applied. Six of seven cyclically loaded specimens failed when one or both of the main tension bars ruptured, while the seventh specimen failed when the compression zone crushed after the cyclic test was terminated at 3 million cycles and a monotonically increasing load was applied. The one beam subjected to a static load until failure exhibited a bond failure in the splice region. The tests showed that heavily confined splices proportioned according to the guidelines set out in ACI Committee 408 recommendations for static loading are adequate for cyclic fatigue loading, and the splice does not appear to influence the fatigue life of the specimen...|$|R

All <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> specimens were constructed from hollow ICEB half units with one side grouting channel. ICEB units {{used in this}} research were exclusively produced from the Soeng Thai Model BP 6 block press. The BP 6 block press is currently manufactured in Thailand under the guidance {{and direction of the}} Center of Vocational Building Technologies (CVBT). All ICEB units and grout constructed for this research were created from mix proportions of soil, sand, cement, and water. Rebar bar sizes were restricted to M 10 (# 3) and M 13 (# 4) for all <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> specimens due to the limited area of the hollow 2 -inch diameter rebar cavity of the ICEB unit. The limited size and strength of the ICEB units also made the use of larger bar diameters impractical. Three ICEB unit types of varying strengths (3. 78 MPa, 7. 81 MPa, and 11. 38 MPa) and three grout types of varying strengths (1. 35 MPa, 7. 47 MPa, and 15. 50 MPa) were developed and used to construct all specimens. The measured ICEB <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> specimen strengths were compared against the predicted strength calculated from the Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC).

40|$|Longitudinal steel <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> {{is always}} {{required}} in reinforced concrete (RC) columns. Normally, in countries having high seismic risk, lap splices of longitudinal steel must be located around mid-height of the storey. However, in regions of low-medium seismic risk, including Hong Kong, lap splices of longitudinal steel begin right above the beam-column interface to facilitate ease of construction. Such splicing method would undesirably cause the column critical region {{to move away}} from the beam-column interface under inelastic deformation.

The maximum applied load for the specimens and their observed failure behaviour are reported. In addition to that, a strain compatibility analysis, average bond stress distribution, and flexural section analysis within the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length of the instrumented specimens are also reported. All of the specimens failed in bond within the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length. The load capacity of two specimens reinforced with plain steel bars was 60 % of the reported load resistance of specimens with identical geometry and reinforced with deformed bars. The CEB-FIP Model Code provisions for average bond stress of plain steel bars underestimated the maximum applied load recorded for the tested specimens by 16 % on average. An empirically derived equation to predict the bond capacity of plain steel bars was determined to be proportional to both the splice length and the nominal bar diameter. Observed cracks in the shear spans remained vertical and suggest the development of arch action within this region. The formation of a large crack at one end of the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length and a review of the load versus deflection behaviour indicated a sudden bond failure of the specimens. Removal of concrete cover at the ends of the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length following testing of the specimens showed evidence of slip of the lapped bars. Instrumented splice specimens provided evidence of bond loss within the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> region.

40|$|Manufacturing, fabrication, and {{transportation}} limitations {{make it impossible}} to provide full length continuous bars in some reinforced concrete structures. In general, reinforcing bars are stocked by suppliers in lengths of 12 – 18 m. For that reason, and because it is often more convenient to work with shorter bar lengths, it is frequently necessary to splice bars in the field. Proper splicing of reinforcing bars is crucial to the integrity of reinforced concrete. ACI Code states: “splices of reinforcement shall be made only as required or permitted on the design drawings, in the specifications, or as authorized by the engineer. ” Great responsibility for design, specification, and performance of splices rests with the engineer who is familiar with the structural analysis and design stresses, probable construction conditions and final conditions of service can properly evaluate the variables to select the most efficient and economical <b>splice</b> method. <b>Lap</b> <b>splicing,</b> which requires the overlapping of two parallel bars, has long been accepted as an effective, economical splicing method.

This {{study focused on}} discontinuities associated with changes in {{the geometry}} of the cross section along the height of planar walls. It also addressed longitudinal reinforcement discontinuities and their effects on the seismic performance of structural walls resisting seismic demands. Two series of tests were conducted to investigate {{these two types of}} discontinuities. ^ To study the effects of reinforcement discontinuities, six test walls were subjected to lateral displacement reversals of increasing amplitude up to failure. The effects <b>lap</b> <b>splices,</b> splice length (60 bar diameters and 40 bar diameters), and boundary-element confinement were studied. The measured drift capacity ranged from 2. 5 % to 3 % for the walls without <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> and from 1. 5 % to 2. 5 % for the walls with <b>lap</b> <b>splices.</b> The increase in drift capacity caused by the boundary-element confining reinforcement ranged between 20 % and 67 %. <b>Lap</b> <b>splices</b> caused tensile-strain concentrations at the bases of the walls after yield. The rate of increase in maximum unit strain with increasing drift observed in walls with splices was approximately twice the rate observed in walls without splices. This difference results in longitudinal-bar buckling at smaller drift ratios in walls with <b>lap</b> <b>splices.</b> A method to estimate the drift capacity of walls vulnerable to longitudinal bar buckling is proposed. Lap-splice failures did not occur in the tests conducted in this study. These types of failures have occurred in beams subjected to nearly constant moment and with <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> with configurations resembling those of splices in wall boundary elements. It was concluded that the response of a splice is sensitive to moment gradient because it causes differences in the bar stresses on both ends of the splice. ^ To study the combined effects of reinforcement and geometric discontinuities, two walls with elevations in the shape of inverted trousers were tested under static lateral loads. In both walls the region intended to represent a first story in a structural wall had no openings. The region intended to represent higher stories had a central opening. The difference between the specimens was the continuity of the longitudinal reinforcement flanking the opening. This reinforcement was anchored beyond the section meant to represent the foundation in one specimen, and it was anchored in the region meant to represent the first story in the other specimen. The panel zones (i. e., regions of wall directly below the opening) in both test walls reached shear stresses approaching or exceeding their nominal capacities. Nevertheless, the panel zone flanked by continuous reinforcement performed better in that: 1) it reached smaller shear strains at similar drift ratios, and 2) {{despite the fact that it}} reached its capacity, its deterioration did not cause an anchorage failure of the longitudinal reinforcement flanking it. Anchorage failure limited the lateral-load carrying capacity in the specimen in which the longitudinal reinforcement flanking the panel zone was cut off in the region meant to represent the first story, and the wall did not develop its expected flexural capacity. Expressions to estimate the shear stress demand and strength of panel zones in walls with aligned stacks of openings terminated in the lower stories are proposed and evaluated. ...|$|R

The {{range of the}} transverse spacing between bars was limited to that which allowed the bars to remain within the same cell, and included the evaluation of tied spliced bars in contact. Two-and-a-half block wide by three course tall double pullout specimens reinforced with contact lap splices were initially {{used to determine the}} range of <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length values to be tested in the wall splice specimens such that bond failure of the reinforcement occurred. The double pullout specimens were tested in direct tension with six replicates per arrangement. Three values of <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length: 150, 200, and 250 mm, were selected from the testing of the double pullout specimens and tested in the wall splice specimens in combination with three values of transverse spacing: 0, 25, and 50 mm, with three replicates per configuration. A total of twenty-seven two-and-a-half block wide by thirteen course tall wall splice specimens reinforced with two lap splices were tested in four-point loading. Both the double pullout and the wall splice specimens were constructed in running bond with all cells fully grouted. The tensile {{resistance of}} the lap spliced bars in the double pullout specimens was measured directly. The contact lap splices with a 150, 200, and 250 mm <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length developed approximately 38, 35 and 29 % of the theoretical yield load of the reinforcement, respectively. The difference between the mean tensile resistances of the three reinforcement configurations tested in the double pullout specimens was found to be statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. Different than expected, the tensile resistance of the lap spliced reinforcing bars in the double pullout specimens was inversely proportional to the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length provided. For the short <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> lengths used in this investigation, the linear but not proportional relationship between bond force and <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length known from reinforced concrete is believed to have caused this phenomenon. An iterative sectional analysis using moment-curvature response was used to calculate the tensile resistance of the lap spliced reinforcement in the wall splice specimens. The calculated mean tensile resistance of the reinforcement increased with increasing <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length, and was greater when the bars were in contact. Securing the bars in contact may have influenced the tensile capacity of the contact lap splices as higher stresses are likely to develop {{as a result of the}} bar ribs riding over each other with increasing slip. Results of the data analysis suggest that the tensile resistance of non-contact lap splices within the same cell is generally independent of the spacing between the bars. A comparison of the experimental results for the wall splice specimens with the development and splice length provisions in CSA S 304. 1 - 04 and TMS 402 - 11 indicate that both the Canadian and U.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) and textile-reinforced mortar (TRM) jackets was investigated experimentally and analytically {{in this study}} {{as a means of}} confining old-type reinforced concrete (RC) columns with limited capacity due to bond failure at <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> regions. The local bond strength between lap spliced bars and concrete was measured experimentally along the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> region of six full-scale RC columns subjected to cyclic uniaxial flexure under constant axial load. The bond strength of two column specimens tested without retrofitting was found to be in good agreement with the predictions given by two existing bond models. These models were modified to account for the contribution of composite material jacketing to the bond resistance between lap spliced bars and concrete. The {{effectiveness of}} FRP and TRM jackets against splitting at lap splices was quantified as a function of jacket properties and geometry as well as in terms of the jacket effective strain, which was found to depend on the ratio of <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length to bar diameter. Consequently, simple equations for calculating the bond strength of lap splices in members confined with composite materials (FRP or TRM) are proposed. JRC. DG.

40|$|The bond in a {{reinforcement}} concrete (RC) {{structure is}} represented by the force transfer between the reinforcing bar and the surrounding concrete. All the RC structures are designed to have a perfect bond between the reinforcing bar and the surrounding concrete. However, corrosion of the reinforcing bar in the RC members {{is one of the main}} reasons that affect the bond efficiency in RC member. The deterioration of bond in RC element leads to decrease the service life of the RC structure and may result in sudden failure. Most of the previous research focuses on repairing the corroded RC member with FRP wrapping without cleaning the corroded reinforcing bar. The present research investigated the bond behaviour of cleaned corroded reinforcing bar repaired with partial depth repair concrete, transverse reinforcement or fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets. Thirty-six beam-end specimens and twenty-four <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams were cast and tested under static loading. The beam-end dimensions were 600 mm in length, 500 mm in height and 250 mm in width and reinforced with 20 M bar. The test variables considered for the beam-end specimens were: four corrosion levels (5 %, 7. 5 %, 10 % and 15 % mass loss level) and compared with non-corroded bar. Also, four bonded lengths were studied (200 mm, 250 mm, 300 mm, and 350 mm). Moreover, four partial depth repair concrete were used (commercial prepackaged self-consolidating concrete (SCC 1), another different commercial prepackaged self-consolidating concrete (SCC 2), self-consolidating concrete that was mixed in place and had similar proportions to the monolithic mixes (SCC 3) and normal concrete (NC) mix design was also cast in place and had exactly the same proportions as the monolithic mixes but was used as a partial depth repair). All of the partial depth repair concretes were compared with monolithic beam-end specimen. The <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams dimensions were 2200 mm in length, 350 mm in height and 250 mm in width and reinforced with two 20 M lap spliced bars in the tension zone of the constant moment region with 300 mm splice length. Also, the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams were reinforced with two 10 M continuous bars in the compression zone. The test variables considered for the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams were: commercial prepackaged self-consolidating concrete extended with 50 % of 13 mm coarse aggregate (SCC 50) was used as the main partial depth repair. It should be mentioned that SCC 50 was the same partial depth repair concrete (SCC 2) used for the beam-end specimens. Also, Three <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams repaired with commercial prepackaged self-consolidating concrete without coarse aggregate (SCC 0) were also included to study the effect of coarse aggregate on bond behavior. The <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams repaired with partial depth repair concrete were compared with monolithic <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beam. Moreover, two types of confinements were considered in the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams: transverse reinforcement and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets. Six lap spliced beams were confined with transverse reinforcement and six were wrapped with CFRP sheets. This research found that the average bond strength increased as the bar mass loss increased for all bonded lengths. As the bonded length increased, the average bond strength decreased and the corresponding bar slip increased. In the beam-end specimens, the average bond strength of monolithic beam-end specimens was higher than the average bond strength of all types of the partial depth repair regardless the compressive strength of concrete. That was mainly because of internal shear cracks at the interface between the partial depth repair and the substrate concrete. However, since there was not shear at the constant moment region in the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams, the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams repaired with partial depth repair concrete with similar properties of monolithic concrete and had higher concrete strength showed higher average bond strength than the monolithic <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams. Although the partial depth repair concrete SCC 0 had higher compressive strength than SCC 50 and the monolithic concrete; it had the lowest average bond strength. That because the absence of the coarse aggregate in SCC 0 led to a decreased splitting strength and reduced fracture energy; and so the average bond strength was decreased. All self-consolidating concrete (SCC) partial depth repairs showed better bonding than the normal concrete (NC) partial depth repair. The bond strength of beams repaired with FRP sheets was higher than that of the beams confined with transverse reinforcement. The transverse reinforcement increased the average bond strength and the corresponding slip by (15 % - 29 %) and (32 % - 62 %) compared to the unwrapped beams, respectively. However, the beams confined with FRP sheets showed an increase in the bond strength and the corresponding slip by (34 - 49 %) and (56 - 260 %) compared to the unconfined beams, respectively. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to predict the effect of mass loss level, bonded length and presence repair concrete on the average bond strength of beam-end specimens. Also, a model was calibrated to predict the average bond strength with increasing the mass loss level of the reinforcing bar of <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams. Moreover, another model was used to allow the design engineers to estimate the bond stress distribution along the spliced reinforcing bars as the splitting crack propagated...|$|E

40|$|With each seismic event, {{various degrees}} of damage are {{imparted}} to the quake area's superstructures. Concrete columns of these superstructures are often damaged or susceptible to collapse. Those columns exhibiting damage but still functioning under everyday use are structurally assessed. This evaluation considers the degree of remaining capacity the structure still maintains to carry future earthquake loading. Replacement or retrofitting the existing structure {{is the most common}} result once these evaluations have been undertaken. The following research consists of the application and testing of a new composite jacketing system proposed for use in this necessary retrofitting of damaged superstructures. The Highway Innovative Technology Evaluation Center (HITEC) of the Civil Engineering Research Foundation (CERF) has instrumented a process in which composite jackets may be tested to determine their effectiveness as a retrofit option. Using these HITEC evaluation guidelines for "FPR Composite Wrap Durability Evaluation", testing was conducted to assess the response of a novel, fabric- expansive foam sandwich panel jacket. This involved the construction and testing of 6 concrete columns and a structural response model to evaluate the material and its behavior. The new system performed well on square shear, circular and square continuously reinforced flexure and the circular <b>lap</b> <b>spliced</b> reinforced flexure columns, but failed due to inadequate ductility increase on the square <b>lap</b> <b>spliced</b> column and unexpected failure mechanism in the circular shear colum...|$|R
