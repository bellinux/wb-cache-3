The operating frequency varies with changes in <b>load</b> <b>impedance,</b> with changes in the supply current, and with the temperature of the tube. This is not a problem in uses such as heating, or in some forms of radar where the receiver can be synchronized with an imprecise magnetron frequency. Where precise frequencies are needed, other devices, such as the klystron are used.|$|E
25|$|The gain of an {{amplifier}} is {{the ratio}} of output to input power or amplitude, and is usually measured in decibels. (When measured in decibels it is logarithmically related to the power ratio: G(dB)=10 log(Pout /(Pin)). RF amplifiers are often specified {{in terms of the}} maximum power gain obtainable, while the voltage gain of audio amplifiers and instrumentation amplifiers will be more often specified (since the amplifier's input impedance will often be much higher than the source impedance, and the <b>load</b> <b>impedance</b> higher than the amplifier's output impedance). For example, an audio amplifier with a gain given as 20dB will have a voltage gain of ten (but a power gain of 100 would only occur in the event the input and output impedances were identical).|$|E
25|$|The load that {{a driver}} {{presents}} to an amplifier {{consists of a}} complex electrical impedance—a combination of resistance and both capacitive and inductive reactance, which combines properties of the driver, its mechanical motion, the effects of crossover components (if any are in the signal path between amplifier and driver), {{and the effects of}} air loading on the driver as modified by the enclosure and its environment. Most amplifiers' output specifications are given at a specific power into an ideal resistive load; however, a loudspeaker does not have a constant impedance across its frequency range. Instead, the voice coil is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonances, the enclosure changes the driver's electrical and mechanical characteristics, and a passive crossover between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its own variations. The result is a <b>load</b> <b>impedance</b> that varies widely with frequency, and usually a varying phase relationship between voltage and current as well, also changing with frequency. Some amplifiers can cope with the variation better than others can.|$|E

2500|$|The {{non-inverting}} input of the operational amplifier needs {{a path for}} DC to ground; if the signal source does not supply a DC path, or if that source requires a given <b>load</b> <b>impedance,</b> then the circuit will require another resistor from the {{non-inverting input}} to ground.
