5|$|As in {{many other}} insects, the <b>lift</b> <b>generated</b> by {{butterflies}} is more than can {{be accounted for by}} steady-state, non-transitory aerodynamics. Studies using Vanessa atalanta in a wind tunnel show that they use a wide variety of aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force. These include wake capture, vortices at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the Weis-Fogh 'clap-and-fling' mechanism. Butterflies are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.|$|E
5|$|The Zveno-3 {{in which}} TB-3 carried two Grigorovich I-Z fighters under the wings {{presented}} a different challenge — the I-Z was a monoplane with fixed landing gear which touched the ground {{while it was}} suspended under the mothership. To accommodate the uneven ground during takeoffs, the fighters were attached via a floating frame that permitted vertical movement relative to the TB-3. However, immediately after takeoff the I-Z pilots had to push forward on the control sticks to lock the frame in the fixed bottom position — if the fighter-bomber was not rigid in flight, the bomber became extremely difficult to control. During one of the test flights, I-Z pilot Korotkov incorrectly timed the locking maneuver and the <b>lift</b> <b>generated</b> by his fighter broke the docking frame and crashed him {{into the bottom of}} the mothership's wing. As the bomber came in for an emergency landing with both fighters still attached, the slow landing speed of the TB-3 resulted in loss of lift for the I-Z which fell away, killing Korotkov. This was the most serious accident of the entire Zveno program despite the inherent complexity of carrying as many as five aircraft, performing mid-air launches and dockings, and damage to the motherships by propellers and landing gear of the fighters. Tests with various combinations of aircraft determined that top-mounted configurations presented the most difficulty in docking due to turbulent airflow coming off the mothership's wings. The problem of safe underwing attachment was solved with the appearance of the Polikarpov I-16 fighter with retractable landing gear. This permitted the use of the same rigid mounting frames as for the top-mounted aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{study on}} the effect of allocating a square {{blockage}} in front of a rotating cylinder is presented. The aim of the study is to determine the optimum design of the blockage to enhance the <b>lift</b> <b>generating</b> performance of the rotating cylinder. A numerical simulation is carried out to investigate the effect of different sizes of blockage towards the <b>lift</b> <b>generating</b> performance of the rotating cylinder. The simulation adopted a fully turbulent flow, having Reynolds number of 600 and the spinning of the cylinder at 100 RPM. The validation of simulation results from RANS code FLUENT is done through comparison with the published results from past studies. In general, the results suggest that <b>lift</b> <b>generating</b> performance of the rotating cylinder will be improved by placing a blockage in front of it...|$|R

500|$|Insect flight {{has been}} a topic of great {{interest}} in aerodynamics due partly to the inability of steady-state theories to explain the <b>lift</b> <b>generated</b> by the tiny wings of insects.

500|$|Strong outflow from {{thunderstorms}} causes {{rapid changes}} in the three-dimensional wind velocity just above ground level. Initially, this outflow causes a headwind that increases airspeed, which normally causes a pilot to reduce engine power if they are unaware of the wind shear. As the aircraft passes into {{the region of the}} downdraft, the localized headwind diminishes, reducing the aircraft's airspeed and increasing its sink rate. Then, when the aircraft passes through {{the other side of the}} downdraft, the headwind becomes a tailwind, reducing <b>lift</b> <b>generated</b> by the wings, and leaving the aircraft in a low-power, low-speed descent. This can lead to an accident if the aircraft is too low to effect a recovery before ground contact.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "lift" [...] mode for {{assisted}} vertical maneuvers, 29,000hp is diverted forward {{through a}} driveshaft from the engine's low-pressure (LP) turbine via a clutch and bevel-gearbox to a vertically mounted, contra-rotating lift fan located {{forward of the}} main engine. The fan efflux (low-velocity unheated air) discharges through a thrust vectoring nozzle {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, thus balancing the aft <b>lift</b> <b>generated</b> by the 3BSM. For lateral stability and roll control, bypass air from the engine goes out through a roll-post nozzle in each wing. For pitch control, the areas of exhaust nozzle and LiftFan inlet are varied conversely to change the balance between them while maintaining their sum, and with constant turbine speed. Yaw control is achieved by yawing the 3BSM. Forward, and even backward, motion is controlled by tilting the 3BSM and LiftFan outlet.|$|E

2500|$|On 13 July 1908 the airship was reinflated {{with fresh}} {{hydrogen}} to ensure maximum lift for the planned 24-hour endurance trial, {{which was to}} be a return flight to Mainz. Shortly after setting off the next morning a fan broke on the forward engine and it had to turn back. The following day it was damaged while being manoeuvered out of its hangar: repairs were not completed {{until the end of the}} month. [...] The trial flight finally started on 4 August, when LZ4 lifted off at 06:22 in the morning, carrying 12 people and sufficient fuel for 31hours of flight. The flight to Zürich had excited considerable public interest, and large crowds gathered along the route to witness the flight, which took it over Konstanz, Schaffhausen, Basel and Strasbourg. [...] Shortly after passing Strasbourg the forward engine had to be stopped since the fuel tank in the engine gondola had been exhausted, and needed to be refilled. At this point the airship was flying light due to the heat of the sun having caused the hydrogen to expand, and was being held at a low altitude by dynamic downforce generated by flying in a nose-down attitude: with the loss of the power of one engine, it rose to an altitude of , venting gas from the relief valves as it did so. At 1:58 p.m the aft engine had to be stopped for refuelling: this time the airship rose to , with a further loss of hydrogen. Two further engine stoppages caused further loss of gas: by now LZ4 was only being kept in the air by dynamic <b>lift</b> <b>generated</b> by flying with a nose-up attitude, the resultant drag reducing its speed to , and at 5:24 pm a landing was made on the Rhine near Oppenheim, [...] short of Mainz. [...] All superfluous items and five crew members were unloaded, and the flight was resumed at 10:20. Mainz was reached half an hour later, and the ship turned to begin its return journey. Further engine problems followed: a crank bearing in the forward engine melted at 1:27 am, reducing airspeed to about [...] and it was decided to land to have the engine repaired by engineers from the Daimler works at Untertürkheim. Accordingly, LZ4 was set down at 7:51 am at Echterdingen.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} work an {{investigation}} of the aerodynamics of a Fomula Student race car was conducted. The work focused on a computational fuid dynamics evaluation of the aerodynamic effects predicted for the car moving through relatively sharp corners of constant curvature. To assess the credibility of the closure models investigated, comparisons with experimental reference cases were conducted. To put some bounds on the numerical discretization errors for the car simulations, a grid convergence study was also conducted. For the simplied wing validation test cases, a relatively good agreement between aerodynamic performance values obtained from experiments and simulations was found. For the full car simulations, comparisons were made with on track measured values of lift. With respect to the measured values, the predictions of lift obtained from the simplified computer model geometry was high. It is believed that this was due, in part, to the simplicity of the model geometry, allowing for less disturbed air flow around the <b>lift</b> <b>generating</b> devices of the car, as well as the turbulence models inability to accurately predict amplitudes and the stream wise extent of the wake of bluff bodies directly upstream of several key <b>lift</b> <b>generating</b> devices. For assessing the aerodynamic effects of steady state cornering for the vehicle the momenta about its yaw, pitch and roll axes were tracked. In addition, lift, drag and sideforces were investigated. The modelling of rotational flow around the car found effects not present in, and in direct opposition to those predicted by modelling a cornering vehicle as having a fixed yaw angle with respect to the free stream...|$|R
