5|$|In 1862, Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich was {{appointed}} viceroy of Russian Poland {{by his brother}} and moved to Warsaw {{with his wife and}} children. The stay in Poland proved difficult for the Grand Duke, who was the victim of a nationalist assassination attempt the day after his arrival in the Polish capital. Although Constantine embarked on a program of <b>liberalization</b> <b>and</b> re-instated Polish as an official language, Polish nationalists agitating for reform were not appeased. Finally, an uprising in January 1863 and the radicalization of the separatists pushed the Tsar to recall his brother in August. Olga's difficult experiences in Poland marked her profoundly.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{currency}} devaluations and oil crises in the 1970s led most countries to float their currencies. The world economy became increasingly financially integrated in the 1980s and 1990s due to capital account <b>liberalization</b> <b>and</b> financial deregulation. A series of financial crises in Europe, Asia, and Latin America followed with contagious effects due to greater exposure to volatile capital flows. The global financial crisis, which {{originated in the}} United States in 2007, quickly propagated among other nations and is recognized as the catalyst for the worldwide Great Recession. A market adjustment to Greece's noncompliance with its monetary union in 2009 ignited a sovereign debt crisis among European nations known as the Eurozone crisis.|$|E

5|$|Cuba and Venezuela {{were the}} {{founding}} {{members of the}} Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). ALBA sought to redistribute wealth evenly throughout member countries, to protect the region's agriculture, and to oppose economic <b>liberalization</b> <b>and</b> privatization. ALBA's origins lay in a December 2004 agreement signed between the two countries, and was formalized through a People's Trade Agreement also signed by Evo Morales' Bolivia in April 2006. Castro had also been calling for greater Caribbean integration since the late 1990s, saying that only strengthened cooperation between Caribbean countries would prevent their domination by rich nations in a global economy. Cuba has opened four additional embassies in the Caribbean Community including: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Suriname, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. This development makes Cuba the only country to have embassies in all independent countries of the Caribbean Community.|$|E
5|$|In February 1991, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic and Slovakia (as Czechoslovakia) {{formed the}} Visegrád Group {{to push for}} European {{integration}} under the European Union and NATO, {{as well as to}} conduct military reforms in line with NATO standards. Internal NATO reaction to these former Warsaw Pact countries was initially negative, but by the 1991 Rome summit in November, members agreed to a series of goals that could lead to accession, such as market and democratic <b>liberalization,</b> <b>and</b> that NATO should be a partner in these efforts. In subsequent years, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its eastern neighbors were set up, including the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (later the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council) and the Partnership for Peace.|$|E
5|$|Royal marriages of the 19th {{century were}} {{arranged}} to secure alliances {{and to maintain}} blood ties among the European nations. As early as 1851, Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and her German-born husband, Prince Albert, were making plans to marry their eldest daughter, Victoria, Princess Royal, to Frederick. The royal dynasty in Britain was predominantly German; there was little British blood in Queen Victoria, and none in her husband. The monarchs desired to maintain their family's blood ties to Germany, and Prince Albert further hoped that the marriage {{would lead to the}} <b>liberalization</b> <b>and</b> modernization of Prussia. King Leopold I of Belgium, uncle of the British monarch and consort, also favoured this pairing; he had long treasured Baron Stockmar's idea of a marriage alliance between Britain and Prussia. Frederick's father, Prince William, had no interest in the arrangement, hoping instead for a Russian Grand Duchess as his daughter-in-law. However, Princess Augusta was greatly in favour of a match for her son that would bring closer connections with Britain. In 1851, his mother sent Frederick to England, ostensibly to visit the Great Exhibition but in truth she hoped that the cradle of liberalism and home of the industrial revolution would have a positive influence on her son. Prince Albert took Frederick under his wing during his stay but it was Albert's daughter, only eleven at the time, who guided the German prince around the Exhibition. Frederick only knew a few words of English, while Victoria could converse fluently in German. He was impressed by her mix of innocence, intellectual curiosity and simplicity, and their meeting proved to be a success. A regular exchange of letters between Victoria and Frederick followed.|$|E
50|$|The {{association}} had {{a political}} platform based on 13 points, {{which included a}} flat tax at 20%, fiscal federalism, presidentialism and first-past-the-post electoral system, <b>liberalizations</b> <b>and</b> privatizations.

50|$|The {{economic}} <b>liberalizations,</b> <b>and</b> {{foreign policy}} changes implemented by Nasser's successor as president, Anwar El Sadat, alienated many ideological Nasserists {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s. One illegal group, the Thawrat Misri, or Egyptian Revolution was formed in 1980. After it was broken up by the government, several of Nasser's relatives were shown to be involved.|$|R

25|$|Perhaps some of {{the most}} {{important}} policies and breakthroughs of the administration are the Capital Account <b>Liberalization</b> <b>and</b> the subsequent commitments to free trade associations such as APEC, AFTA, GATT, and WTO. The <b>liberalization</b> <b>and</b> opening of the capital opening culminated in full-peso convertibility in 1992. And then another breakthrough is again, the establishment of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which also involved the reduction of debts in that the debts of the old central bank were taken off its books.|$|E

His tolerance of dissent irritated the regime, and Ivașcu was pushed back into accepting and even promoting communist censorship during the final two decades of his life.|$|E

50|$|Bridging {{economic}} theory with empirical tests, James Anderson and Jeffrey Bergstrand develop econometric models, {{grounded in the}} theories of differentiated goods, which measure the gains from trade <b>liberalizations</b> <b>and</b> {{the magnitude of the}} border barriers on trade (see McCallum Border puzzle). A recent synthesis of empirical research using the gravity equations, however, show that the effect of border barriers on trade is relatively modest.|$|R

25|$|The WTO {{launched}} the current round of negotiations, the Doha Development Round, {{at the fourth}} ministerial conference in Doha, Qatar in November 2001. This was to be an ambitious effort to make globalization more inclusive and help the world's poor, particularly by slashing barriers and subsidies in farming. The initial agenda comprised both further trade <b>liberalization</b> <b>and</b> new rule-making, underpinned by commitments to strengthen substantial assistance to developing countries.|$|E

Censorship was relaxed, and a resolution was drafted to help reduce corruption within the royal family and the government. Protesters were tried in civilian courts rather than by military court-martials, and were quickly released.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s and 1980s {{there was}} a shift in power away from the KMT to people native to Taiwan. This, {{combined}} with cultural <b>liberalization</b> <b>and</b> the increasing remoteness {{of the possibility of}} retaking mainland China, led to a cultural and political movement which emphasized a Taiwan-centered view of history and culture rather than one which was China-centered or even, as before 1946, Japan-centered.

50|$|A {{dominant}} {{figure in}} the following years was Nicolay Fardal (1883-1960), who was pastor in the congregation in Kristiansand from 1928 to 1960. During his time as a pastor the adherents to The Community grew and there were few theological disputes. This period of growth and theological harmony lasted until the early 1990s, when the church's ban on trousers for women was challenged. This controversy was solved by allowing {{the members of the}} church to follow their conscience when it comes to dressing appropriately and decently. The years that followed brought several <b>liberalizations</b> <b>and</b> reforms.|$|R
25|$|Industry {{received}} little external {{assistance from the}} end of the war through 1995. Beginning in 1996-97, the government has become increasingly active in helping the industrial sector to restore production through technical and financial assistance, including loan guarantees, economic <b>liberalization,</b> <b>and</b> the privatization of state-owned enterprises. In early 1998, the government set up a one-stop investment promotion center and implemented a new investment code that created an enabling environment for foreign and local investors. An autonomous revenue authority also has begun operation, improving collections and accountability.|$|E
25|$|Yugoslavia began {{a number}} of {{fundamental}} reforms {{beginning in the early}} 1950s, bringing about change in three major directions: rapid <b>liberalization</b> <b>and</b> decentralization of the country's political system, the institution of a new, unique economic system, and a diplomatic policy of non-alignment. Yugoslavia refused {{to take part in the}} communist Warsaw Pact and instead took a neutral stance in the Cold War and became a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement along with countries like India, Egypt and Indonesia, and pursued one of its center-left influences that promoted a non-confrontational policy towards the U.S.|$|E
25|$|He {{vowed to}} {{transform}} Russia's socialist economy into a capitalist market economy and implemented economic shock therapy, price <b>liberalization,</b> <b>and</b> nationwide privatization. Due to the sudden total economic shift, {{a majority of}} the national property and wealth fell into the hands of a small number of oligarchs. The well-off millionaire and billionaire oligarchs likened themselves to 19th century robber barons. Rather than creating new enterprises, Yeltsin's democratization led to international monopolies hijacking the former Soviet markets, arbitraging the huge difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market.|$|E
