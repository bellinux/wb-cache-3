40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{interaction}} between implicit and explicit processes during skill learning, in terms of top-down <b>learning</b> (<b>that</b> is, <b>learning</b> <b>that</b> goes from explicit to implicit knowledge) versus bottom-up <b>learning</b> (<b>that</b> is, <b>learning</b> <b>that</b> goes from implicit to explicit knowledge). Instead of studying each type of knowledge (implicit or explicit) in isolation, we stress {{the interaction between}} the two types, especially in terms of one type giving rise to the other, and its e#ects on learning. The work presents an integrated model of skill <b>learning</b> <b>that</b> takes into account both implicit and explicit processes and both top-down and bottom-up learning. We examine and simulate human data in the Tower of Hanoi task. The paper shows how the quantitative data in this task may be captured using either top-down or bottom-up approaches, although top-down learning is a more apt explanation of the human data currently available. These results illustrate the two different directions of learning (top-down versus bottom-up), and thereby provide a new perspective on skill learning...|$|R
