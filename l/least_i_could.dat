2500|$|Udwin {{has said}} it was the protests in {{response}} to the rape that drew her to make this film. [...] "I was absolutely awestruck by the ordinary men and women of India who poured out onto the streets in response to this horrific gang rape and who demanded change for women's rights. And I thought the <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was amplify their voices." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{was sitting}} at my desk {{examining}} the Kolyvagin–Flach method. It wasn't that I believed I could make it work, but I thought that at <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> explain why it didn’t work. Suddenly I had this incredible revelation. I realised that, the Kolyvagin–Flach method wasn't working, {{but it was all}} I needed to make my original Iwasawa theory work from three years earlier. So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant. I couldn't understand how I'd missed it and I just stared at it in disbelief for twenty minutes. Then during the day I walked around the department, and I'd keep coming back to my desk looking {{to see if it was}} still there. It was still there. I couldn't contain myself, I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much." ...|$|E
60|$|At <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be {{but little}} {{worse off than}} I {{had been in the}} Pit of Plenty.|$|E
6000|$|... "Would God that I {{had been}} with you every step! Would God, at <b>least,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> show as good a three-years' log-book, Amyas, my lad!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Pop {{indicated}} that iconic blues singer Howlin' Wolf [...] "was really pertinent {{for me on}} Fun House. That stuff is Wolfy, at <b>least</b> as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I haven't {{had half}} an hour to myself to-day; at <b>least</b> when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have {{attended}} to it. Don't be afraid, Carey, I'm not daunted by the doubts of our good friends. I see your eyes reproaching me with that." ...|$|R
60|$|To mitigate, {{even though}} slightly, the embarrassment I summoned the waiter and ordered another bottle of the Barbera. I {{thought it was}} the <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do.|$|E
6000|$|George {{makes his}} {{military}} bow. [...] "As {{far as that}} goes, Sir Leicester, I have done my duty under discipline, {{and it was the}} <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did what}} I could," [...] Karl growled, [...] "but {{it was not}} much. The colonel has always looked well after me, and the <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was to look after him, when he wanted it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that I cannot explain, sir," [...] he confessed. [...] "To tell you the truth, I do not {{understand}} in the <b>least</b> how <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have brought myself to be so untruthful. I am only thankful that no harm has been done." ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS REED, breathlessly: [...] "What princely courage! What {{delicate}} magnanimity! Oh, he needn't {{have the}} <b>LEAST</b> fear! If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only tell him that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To me a {{forbidden}} subject,' said Venetia, 'at <b>least</b> {{with them}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> alone converse upon it, {{but one that}} my mind never deserts.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then I think I {{can do all}} that's wanted {{here for}} a bit; at any rate, till you can get help, sir. At <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> if I could find the fuel-house. 'Tis no such big place as I thought!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is I who am honoured," [...] {{answered}} d'Aguilar; [...] "and {{as for the}} feast, his Grace is sparing in this Lenten season. At <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{get little}} to eat, and, therefore, like the señor Peter, I am starved." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was the <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to {{give the}} melon a more {{particular}} examination; which, when I had done, I could but shake my head. [...] "I am truly sorry, Pinkerton," [...] said I, [...] "but I can't advise you to persevere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O Mr Flint! pray stop!" [...] cried Miss Lillycrop, {{pressing}} {{her hands to}} her eyes; [...] "I never could take in figures. At <b>least</b> <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> keep them in. They just go in here, and come out there (pointing to her two ears), and leave no impression whatever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What was I to do? I {{had brought}} these people {{step by step}} to the verge of starvation. I had laid waste alike their {{happiness}} and their prospects in life. The <b>least</b> amends <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make was to see that at all events {{they did not want}} for the necessities of existence.|$|R
6000|$|STRATEGY AND MESMERISM. To {{gain time}} for further reflection, {{and hoping that}} by a seeming {{acquiescence}} I might regain my personal liberty, at <b>least</b> till <b>I</b> <b>could</b> give an alarm, or take advantage of some momentary inadvertence of Winters, and then without a cowardly flight escape, I resolved to write {{a certain kind of}} retraction, but previously had inwardly decided: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} {{talk with a}} girl like this; at <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not meet her on her own {{conversational}} grounds. I was so agitated myself that it seemed unnatural that any one to whom I should speak should not also be agitated.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I'll {{tell you}} my object in getting the present,' said Knight, with a {{composure}} intended to remove from her mind any possible impression of his being what he was--her lover. 'You see {{it was the very}} <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do in common civility.' ...|$|E
60|$|Next day, in {{defiance}} of a thing which never should be considered--luck--I took Haught's rifle again, and my lazy, sullen, intractable horse, and rode with Edd and George down into Horton Thicket. At <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not be cheated out of fresh air and beautiful scenery.|$|E
60|$|But what need I {{have been}} {{concerned}} at the tediousness of any thing I had to do, seeing I had time {{enough to do it}} in? Nor had I any other employment if that had been over, at <b>least</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> foresee, except the ranging the island to seek for food, which I did more or less every day.|$|R
60|$|I felt {{so deeply}} {{sensible}} {{of the danger}} in which he stood that I tried, in Ada's name, in my guardian's, in my own, by every fervent means that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think of, to warn him of it and to show him some of his mistakes. He received everything I said with patience and gentleness, but it all rebounded from him without taking the <b>least</b> effect. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not wonder at this after the reception his preoccupied mind had given to my guardian's letter, but I determined to try Ada's influence yet.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{could not}} be," [...] said the Doctor quickly. [...] "At <b>least</b> <b>I</b> think it <b>could</b> hardly be," [...] he added cautiously, {{with a brief}} bow to me. [...] "You see, the left hand is covered with blood; {{but there is no}} blood mark {{whatever}} on the safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I {{have made a}} hole with my tongue that my heart will never mend. O these {{intolerable}} times: that ill-luck should follow a man for honestly telling a woman she is beautiful! 'Twas the most I said--you must own that; and the <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say--that I own myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are many}} ways of getting hold of them, and {{with some of these}} I am familiar," [...] said Paul. [...] "For instance, I can use the long-bow with some skill--at <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do so when at school. And I have no doubt, captain, that you know how to use the cross-bow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Michael blushed. [...] "It was the <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to let {{you have}} some business," [...] he said. [...] "But there's one thing more. I don't want you to misjudge poor Pitman, who is the most {{harmless}} being upon earth. I wish you would dine with me to-night, and see the creature on his native heath--say at Verrey's?" ...|$|E
60|$|To confide {{my private}} surmises, even to my aunt, {{would have been}} an act of inexcusable imprudence, to say the <b>least</b> of it. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only reply that Madame Fontaine was not very well, and was (as I had heard from Minna) shut up in the {{retirement}} of her own room.|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{three hundred}} {{thousand}} pounds more are returned thither on [...] other accounts; and, upon the whole, those who are the best versed [...] {{in that kind of}} knowledge agree, that England gains annually by [...] Ireland a million at <b>least,</b> which even <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make appear beyond [...] all doubt.|$|R
60|$|All this {{is rather}} pleasing, nor have <b>I</b> the <b>least</b> doubt that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make myself easy by {{literary}} labour. But {{much of it}} looks like winding up my bottom {{for the rest of}} my life. But there is a worse symptom of settling accounts, of which I have felt some signs.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is my child, George. A man can't deny {{himself to}} his child. At <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not. And I don't {{want to be a}} {{merchant}} prince. If I could only have a little place of my own, that was my own; and where they wouldn't always be nagging after money when they come to see me." ...|$|E
60|$|And now I {{began to}} feel that I was {{neglecting}} my business, that since I had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes, the <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was to overhear them at their councils, and that my plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as I could manage, under the favourable ambush of the crouching trees.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] added Thorne, [...] "I {{was quite}} sure when the {{storekeeper}} {{appeared on the}} scene that he had hired the biggest tough in the settlement to make trouble for me. Of course I could have backed down, or at <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have tried it, but the result would naturally have been to make the opposition more determined on the next occasion. It seemed wiser to face the situation then and there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{set to work}} on the old claim with my boy Harry {{and half}} a dozen Kaffirs to help me, which, seeing that I had put nearly all my worldly wealth into it, was the <b>least</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do. And we worked, my word, we did work--early and late we went at it--but never a bit of gold did we see; no, not even a nugget large enough to make a scarf-pin out of. The American gentleman had secured it all and left us the sweepings.|$|R
60|$|I had now such a load on my {{mind that}} it kept me perpetually waking; to reveal it, {{which would have been}} some ease to me, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not find would be to any purpose, and yet to conceal it would be next to impossible; nay, I did not doubt but I should talk of it in my sleep, and tell my husband of it whether I would or no. If I {{discovered}} it, the <b>least</b> thing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> expect was to lose my husband, for he was too nice and too honest a man to have continued my husband after he had known I had been his sister; so that I was perplexed to the last degree.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Is it {{negligence}} and impiety, if I did not consult manuscripts {{which were}} simply not within my reach? <b>I</b> have at <b>least</b> assembled whatever <b>I</b> <b>could</b> assemble. Let Lee produce a Greek MS. which contains what my edition {{does not contain}} and let him show that that manuscript was within my reach. [...] can he reproach me with negligence in sacred matters.' ...|$|R
