5|$|In 1770, Peter Simon Pallas {{visited the}} same site as Lehmann and found a red lead mineral that had useful {{properties}} as a pigment in paints. The use of Siberian red <b>lead</b> <b>as</b> a paint pigment then developed rapidly. A bright yellow pigment made from crocoite also became popular.|$|E

The Rays spent only a few days leading the American League East, but held a share of the <b>lead</b> <b>as</b> late as August 24. The Cleveland Indians did not lead the American League Central after July 2 but remained close throughout the season and ultimately finished just a single game back of the Central champion Detroit Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Bulk lead {{exposed to}} moist air forms a {{protective}} layer of varying composition. Lead carbonate {{is a common}} constituent; the sulfate or chloride may also be present in urban or maritime settings. This layer makes bulk lead effectively chemically inert in the air. Finely powdered <b>lead,</b> <b>as</b> with many metals, is pyrophoric, and burns with a bluish-white flame.|$|E

5|$|Cincinnati {{gained a}} 7–0 {{lead in the}} first quarter, but Virginia Tech scored 10 {{unanswered}} points to take a 10–7 lead into halftime. In the second half, Virginia Tech extended its <b>lead</b> <b>as</b> its defense kept the Bearcats scoreless. A Tech field goal {{in the third quarter}} was followed by a touchdown in the fourth quarter, and the game ended with Virginia Tech on top, 20–7.|$|E
5|$|Earnhardt {{reclaimed}} {{the lead}} on lap 52, losing it seven laps later to Elliott Sadler. Sadler refueled on the next lap, giving the lead back to Earnhardt. Kenseth took {{the lead on}} lap 61, as Earnhardt and others made green-flag pit stops. Kenseth stopped on lap 71 with Biffle and Edwards, with Biffle taking the <b>lead</b> <b>as</b> the pit-stop cycle ended. Lap 72 saw the first caution, as Blaney's left rear tire shredded {{and he made a}} pit stop. Biffle, Edwards and Sterling Marlin stayed out, while the others stopped.|$|E
5|$|Ileana D'Cruz was {{approached}} {{for the other}} female lead role to be paired with Nagarjuna in early February 2013. She was impressed with her role and the film's script and quoted a fee of 20 million, which was denied by sources close to her. However, Shriya Saran was signed as the other female <b>lead</b> <b>as</b> her fourth collaboration with Nagarjuna. Nagarjuna announced in mid September 2013 that Kaushal Sharma, Srikar Chittarbu and Krishna Yadav, who graduated from the Annapurna International School of Film and Media, would make their debut with this film.|$|E

5|$|Nebraska widened {{its lead}} with a 33-yard {{touchdown}} run six {{minutes into the}} second half, but Tech answered right back with a 33-yard touchdown pass on its subsequent possession. The score cut Nebraska's lead to 24–21. Unfortunately for the Hokies, that score was the closest they would get to a <b>lead</b> <b>as</b> Nebraska's offense began to wear down the Tech defense. Nebraska scored another touchdown {{in the fourth quarter}}, then racked up 10points in the fourth quarter to secure the victory. Nebraska won, 41–21.|$|E
5|$|Tetravalent thorium {{compounds}} {{are usually}} colourless or yellow, {{like those of}} silver or <b>lead,</b> <b>as</b> the Th4+ ion has no 5f or 6d electrons. Thorium chemistry is therefore largely that of an electropositive metal forming a single diamagnetic ion with a stable noble-gas configuration, indicating a similarity between thorium and the main group elements of the s-block. Thorium and uranium are the most investigated of the radioactive elements because their radioactivity is low enough not to require special handling in the laboratory.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Birmingham, Doyle soon linked up with Championship club Nottingham Forest on a short-term loan deal in December 2004. The loan was then extended {{to keep him}} at the City Ground {{for the rest of}} the season. Doyle made his first-team debut for Forest in a fifth-round FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur on 20 February 2005. As the match approached half-time, Doyle gifted Tottenham the <b>lead</b> <b>as</b> a Jermain Defoe free kick bounced out of his hands and into the net, but Forest were able to equalise in the second half to take the tie to a replay. Even though Doyle only played in a further three league matches for Forest, he said he was glad to be able to play regular reserve-team football and the loan spell had exceeded his expectations. He was rumoured to be {{returning to}} Forest on loan for the following season, a move which did not occur.|$|E
5|$|Although all {{elements}} up to oganesson have been discovered, {{of the elements}} above hassium (element 108), only copernicium (element 112), nihonium (element 113), and flerovium (element 114) have known chemical properties, and only for the copernicium is there enough evidence for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, {{even though it is}} currently placed in the carbon group. More recent experiments have suggested, however, that flerovium behaves chemically like <b>lead,</b> <b>as</b> expected from its periodic table position.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Albany, New York, Hand majored in {{philosophy}} at Harvard College and graduated with honors from Harvard Law School. After a short career as a lawyer in Albany and New York City, he was appointed {{at the age of}} 37 as a Federal District Judge in Manhattan in 1909. The profession suited his detached and open-minded temperament, and his decisions soon won him a reputation for craftsmanship and authority. Between 1909 and 1914, under the influence of Herbert Croly's social theories, Hand supported New Nationalism. He ran unsuccessfully as the Progressive Party's candidate for Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals in 1913, but withdrew from active politics shortly afterwards. In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge promoted Hand to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which he went on to <b>lead</b> <b>as</b> the Senior Circuit Judge (later retitled Chief Judge) from 1939 until his semi-retirement in 1951. Scholars have recognized the Second Circuit under Hand as one of the finest appeals courts in the country's history. Friends and admirers often lobbied for Hand's promotion to the Supreme Court, but circumstances and his political past conspired against his appointment.|$|E

5|$|Brooks then {{executed}} a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost {{even with his}} Soviet counterpart Kopliakov. He had drawn level halfway through his leg and made a superior turn to take the <b>lead</b> <b>as</b> they headed home. The Soviet freestyler pulled level with 25m to go before Brooks again pulled away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. He did not breathe {{in the last ten}} metres, and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not pass him. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his team mates. In doing so, he recorded the swiftest freestyle split in the relay, faster than that of the individual 100m freestyle gold medallist, Jörg Woithe of East Germany.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{tactical}} battle Liverpool {{were able to}} score in the 81st minute. A throw-in from Ray Kennedy found Alan Kennedy, whose run up the left hand side of the pitch caught Real off-guard. Kennedy went past Real defender Rafael García Cortés into the Real box, his subsequent shot beat the Real goalkeeper to give Liverpool the lead. Soon afterwards Liverpool replaced Dalglish with midfielder Jimmy Case {{in an attempt to}} see out the match. Although Liverpool had chances to extend their <b>lead</b> <b>as</b> Real went all out to score, Real keeper Agustín Rodríguez made a number of saves to keep his team in the game. The score remained 1–0 and Liverpool won their third European Cup, the first British club to do so. Liverpool's victory meant that Bob Paisley became the first manager to win the European Cup three times.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{relativistic}} {{stabilization of}} flerovium's 7s27p valence electron configuration, the 0 oxidation state {{should also be}} more stable for flerovium than for <b>lead,</b> <b>as</b> the 7p1/2 electrons begin to also exhibit a mild inert pair effect: this stabilization of the neutral state may bring about some similarities between the behaviour of flerovium and the noble gas radon. Due to the expected relative inertness of flerovium, its diatomic compounds FlH and FlF should have lower energies of dissociation than the corresponding lead compounds PbH and PbF. Flerovium(IV) should be even more electronegative than lead(IV); lead(IV) has electronegativity 2.33 on the Pauling scale; the lead(II) value is only 1.87.|$|E

5|$|Estimates of {{the total}} {{reserves}} of salt in the mines range from 82 million tons to 600 million tons. In raw form it contains negligible amounts of Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Sulphates and moisture, with Iron, Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Chromium and <b>Lead</b> <b>as</b> trace elements. Salt from Khewra, also known as Himalayan salt, is red, pink, off-white or transparent. In {{the early years of}} British rule, the Khewra mine produced about 28,000 to 30,000 tons per annum; it increased to about 187,400 tons per annum for the five fiscal years ending 1946–7 and to 136,824 tons for the two years ending 1949–50 with the systematic working introduced by Dr H. Warth. The mine's output was reported in 2003 to be 385,000 tons of salt per annum, which amounts to almost half of Pakistan's total production of rock salt. At that rate of output, the tunnel would be expected to last for another 350 years.|$|E
5|$|Following several stages won by sprinters and {{breakaway}}s, {{the next}} {{test for the}} riders was the legendary Alto de El Angliru in Stage 13. The morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes, but it was dropped to nothing on the ascent {{of what has been}} called the most difficult climb in all of professional cycling. Astana and Caisse d'Epargne both had many support riders in the leading group going up the climb, and they alternately tried to set paces to protect either Contador or Alejandro Valverde while isolating the competition. It was left to Leipheimer to pace Contador to the conclusion as the climb reached its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the finish. Contador indeed {{went on to win the}} stage, and took the race <b>lead</b> <b>as</b> well. Contador added another stage win the next day when only he and Leipheimer could respond to the repeated attacks of Ezequiel Mosquera, and Contador won the sprint.|$|E
