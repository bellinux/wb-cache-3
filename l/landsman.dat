5|$|These {{investigators}} were overseen by two commanding officers {{more concerned with}} politics and their own careers than the case, Deputy Commissioner Ervin Burrell (Frankie Faison) and Major William Rawls (John Doman). Assistant state's attorney Rhonda Pearlman (Deirdre Lovejoy) acted as the legal liaison between the detail and the courthouse and also had {{a sexual relationship with}} McNulty. In the homicide division, Bunk Moreland (Wendell Pierce) was a gifted, dry-witted, hard-drinking detective partnered with McNulty under Sergeant Jay <b>Landsman</b> (Delaney Williams), the sarcastic, sharp-tongued squad supervisor. Peter Gerety had a recurring role as Judge Phelan, the official who started the case moving.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} these Native Americans were, in deeds and correspondence, {{known as the}} Sepasco Indians, a name {{specific}} to Native Americans in the Sepasco area (modern-day Rhinebeck). The word Sepasco probably originated from the tribe's word for little river or stream, sepuus, which {{is believed to have}} referred to the <b>Landsman</b> Kill, a stream parallel to NY308. After the American Civil War, {{only a few of the}} Sepasco were left; the last Sepasco died in a hut near Welch's Cave and Lake Sepasco and was reported in the local newspaper in 1867. By 1685, a trail known as the Sepasco Trail was formed by them and was routed from the Hudson River, eastward through the present-day Village of Rhinebeck, ending at Lake Sepasco. The trail from the Village of Rhinebeck to Lake Sepasco follows roughly modern-day Route308, in some areas slightly to the south, where the highway's side roads are curved in a pattern similar to that of the Sepasco Trail. It is possible that the trail as a whole existed as a spur of an ancient path that stretched from Rhinebeck to Cornwall, Connecticut.|$|E

He spots Detective Crutchfield leaving the unit office and is downcast once again when he learns that Freamon has found yet another body. <b>Landsman</b> checks with the paramedics and then quizzes Bubbles about his actions and motives in confessing to the crime. Bubbles tells him the entire story behind Sherrod's death. Bubbles is filled with remorse and regret and pleads with <b>Landsman</b> to lock him up.|$|E

25|$|Sergeant Jay <b>Landsman</b> {{walks into}} the {{homicide}} unit office humming a carol. His Christmas spirit is rapidly dispelled when he sees several red names being added to the case board. He quizzes Detective Ed Norris about the board; Norris tells him that Lester Freamon is responsible, having received the go-ahead to search vacant houses for concealed bodies. <b>Landsman</b> is angry at the sudden drop in his squad clearance rate and calls Freamon a Hun, a Vandal and a Visigoth. <b>Landsman</b> next asks what Norris is working on and is dismayed {{to find out that}} he is also working a new case: that of a deliberate killing using poisoned narcotics. <b>Landsman</b> is somewhat forgiving when Norris tells him that he has the perpetrator in custody as he came in and voluntarily confessed to the crime.|$|E

But though, from peculiar circumstances, his case occasioned a good deal of indignation among the people of the Neversink, yet, upon its own proper grounds, they did not denounce it. Man-of-war's-men are so habituated to what <b>landsmen</b> would deem excessive cruelties, that they are almost reconciled to inferior severities.|$|R

50|$|Finally, at {{the bottom}} of the {{hierarchical}} tree were the seamen, divided into able seamen and ordinary seamen. Aboard some vessels, an even lower grade existed called <b>landsmen</b> who were seamen-in-training with very little or no naval skill.

25|$|An early {{example of}} the frame story, or framing device, is {{employed}} in the One Thousand and One Nights, in which the character Scheherazade narrates a set of tales (most often fairy tales) to the Sultan Shahriyar over many nights. Many of Scheherazade's tales are also frame stories, such as the Tale of Sindbad the Seaman and Sindbad the <b>Landsman</b> being a collection of adventures related by Sindbad the Seaman to Sindbad the <b>Landsman.</b> The concept of the frame story dates back to ancient Sanskrit literature, and was introduced into Persian and Arabic literature through the Panchatantra.|$|E

25|$|When McNulty {{finds that}} most dead {{homeless}} men {{are concentrated in}} the Southern District, Freamon puts him in touch with an old patrol partner there who agrees to tip them off when new bodies are found. Freamon also devises a plan to show maturation in their serial killer's pattern and acquires dentures to create bite marks on the victims, thus enhancing the media appeal for the story. While canvassing an area frequented by local homeless, McNulty complains that <b>Landsman</b> barely noticed {{his work on the}} case, but Freamon reminds him that if their plan works, the case will attract more interest and sloppiness could be their downfall. Upon returning home, McNulty is confronted by Russell over his drinking and philandering.|$|E
