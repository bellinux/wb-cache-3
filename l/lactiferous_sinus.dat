50|$|Lactiferous ducts {{are lined}} by a {{columnar}} epithelium supported by myoepithelial cells. When {{a woman is}} not lactating, the lactiferous duct is frequently blocked by a keratin plug. This plug helps to prevent bacteria from entering the duct in non-lactating women. Prior to 2005, it was thought within the areola the lactiferous duct would dilate to form the <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinus</b> in which milk accumulates between breastfeeding sessions. However past studies the <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinus</b> does not exist.|$|E
40|$|The teat and <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinus</b> {{epithelium}} {{from the}} mammary glands of 23 lactating ewes was examined by light and electron microscopy. Most of the sinus epithelium {{consisted of two}} layers of non-secretory cells but, in the <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinus,</b> cells with the same ultrastructural features as alveolar secretory cells were also found. Secretory cells sometimes occupied more than 50 % of the total area of the sinus. Many non-secretory cells in the <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinus</b> possessed a single cilium but they were less common in the teat sinus. 'Accessory glands', which opened directly into the lumen of the gland, were found beneath the epithelium in both the teat and the lactiferous sinuses. From their ultrastructure {{it was clear that}} these glands consisted of normal secretory alveoli and that they produced normal milk components. It is suggested that the mixed population of secretory and non-secretory cells in the <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinus</b> provides unique material for the experimental study of many aspects of mammary gland physiology...|$|E
40|$|Some {{parameters}} {{affecting the}} adherence of microbes to the ductular epithelium of the bovine mammary gland were studied. Adherence increased from teat sinus to <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinus</b> {{to the large}} ducts, and cells from the <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinus</b> to the large ducts, and cells from the <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinus</b> were used for all other experiments. There {{was no difference in}} adherence to cells from different quarters of the same cow, but there were significant differences between cows. Scanning electron microscopy suggested that the cells of the ductular epithelium undergo dynamic changes that probably result in secretion and/or desquamation. Adherence to cells could be demonstrated only at a late stage of these changes. The adherence of organisms associated with mastitis was studied using an in vitro test. Adherence generally paralleled prevalence as cause of disease, with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae adhering best. Strain variation suggested that virulence was related to adherence with S. agalactiae and S. dysgalactiae but not with S. aureus. It is proposed that specific adherence is an important aspect of pathogenesis of mastitis due to S. aureus and S. agalactiae...|$|E
50|$|According to {{the migratory}} theory, ductal {{carcinoma}} in situ cells migrate into the <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinuses</b> and the nipple skin. Cancer cells disrupt the normal epithelial barrier and extracellular fluid accumulates {{on the surface of}} the skin, resulting in the crusting of the areola skin.|$|R
50|$|This is the {{mechanism}} by which milk is transported from the breast alveoli to the nipple. Suckling by the baby innervates slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptors that are densely packed around the areolar region. The electrical impulse follows the spinothalamic tract, which begins by innervation of fourth intercostal nerves. The electrical impulse then ascends the posterolateral tract {{for one or two}} vertebral levels and synapses with second-order neurons, called tract cells, in the posterior dorsal horn. The tract cells then decussate via the anterior white commissure to the anterolateral corner and ascend to the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus in the hypothalamus, where they synapse with oxytocinergic third-order neurons. The somas of these neurons are located in the hypothalamus, but their axon and axon terminals are located in the infundibulum and pars nervosa of the posterior pituitary, respectively. The oxytocin is produced in the neuron's soma in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, and is then transported down the infundibulum via the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal tract {{with the help of the}} carrier protein, neurophysin I, to the pars nervosa of the posterior pituitary, and then stored in Herring bodies, where they are stored until the synapse between second- and third-order neurons. Following the electrical impulse, oxytocin is released into the bloodstream. Through the bloodstream, oxytocin makes its way to myoepithelial cells, which lie between the extracellular matrix and luminal epithelial cells that also make up the alveoli in breast tissue. When oxytocin binds to the myoepithelial cells, the cells contract. The increased intra-aveolar pressure forces milk into the <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinuses,</b> into the <b>lactiferous</b> ducts (a study found that <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinuses</b> may not exist. If this is true then milk simply enters the lactiferous ducts), and then out the nipple.|$|R
40|$|The mammary glands {{of eight}} non-lactating dairy cows were infused with either {{endotoxin}} or the sterile culture filtrate in which Escherichia coli had been grown (CCF). Animals were necropsied at intervals up to 24 h after infusion. Only mild {{inflammation of the}} teat and <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinuses</b> occurred after 4 h, subsiding gradually to 24 h. After mixing dry cow secretion with either endotoxin or CCF, an intense inflammatory response was produced on inoculation of quarters of a lactating cow; CCF also produced necrosis of the epithelium. Thus, dry gland secretions do not inhibit the effect of filtrate or endotoxin. It was concluded that the refractory nature of the gland to these toxins in the non-lactating animal {{is due to the}} changes which occur in the ductular epithelium during involution...|$|R

40|$|To obtain B-mode {{ultrasound}} {{images of}} mammary glands in dairy heifers {{at different stages}} of growth, 25 clinically normal Holstein heifers were used. The heifers were divided into 5 groups (n= 5 /group) by stage of their growth: 2 -month-old (group 1), 5 -month-old (group 2), postpuberty (group 3), mid (group 4), and late (group 5) pregnancy. Furthermore, the sections of mammary glands were observed grossly at postmortem examination in one heifer in each group. Ultrasound images varied with the development of mammary glands. In group 1, the mammary glands had distinctive ultrasonographic findings: an oval to fusiform homogeneous hypoechoic structure. In all groups except group 1, mammary tissue consists of two major areas: a homogeneous, medium echogenic area and a poorly-defined, heterogeneous, hypoechoic area mostly in the superficial part. The superficial hypoechoic area spread more extensively and more irregularly with the development of mammary glands. Most pregnant heifers had irregular and extremely hypoechoic or anechoic areas like <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinus</b> in the glands. The gross findings of mammary glands suggested that the hypoechoic areas of various shapes represented the <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinus</b> and ducts. Thus, these results indicate that B-mode ultrasound imaging can visualize the internal structures of udders and could be a useful tool for evaluation of mammary glands in heifers. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{undersurface}} of the epidermis {{covering the}} tip of the nipple {{is similar to that of}} tactile surfaces; at the sides it is more shallow than in the areola where it is evenly reticulated. These are the distinctive structural signatures of the areas. Both the nipple and the areola are glabrous and both have galactophores and sebaceous glands. In the nipple these open only at the tip and are grouped mostly toward the center. In the areola are the glands of Montgomery, accompanying sebaceous glands and a few scattered eccrine sweat glands. Hairs of different sizes are always present at the periphery of the areola but not in its middle. Both the galactophores and sebaceous glands contain variable numbers of melanocytes among their epithelial cells. Sensory nerve end organs are found only at {{the tip of}} the nipple and sensory nerves are loosely wrapped around the galactophores, lactiferous ducts, and some <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinuses.</b> Both the nipple and the areola have a bountiful framework of elastic fibers that supply rigidity and support, anchor smooth muscle fibers, keep the <b>lactiferous</b> ducts and <b>sinuses</b> from collapsing, and attach the epidermis to the dermis. Elastosis frequently takes place in the nipples and areolae, even at comparatively early ages. The nipples and areolae of women, men, girls, and boys are qualitatively identical but quantitatively different...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: A escolha pela mastectomia com preservação do complexo areolomamilar (CAM), de melhor resultado estético, depende da ausência de envolvimento neoplásico do CAM. OBJETIVO: Identificar os fatores preditivos de invasão neoplásica do CAM. MÉTODO: Foi realizado estudo analítico, retrospectivo, clínico-patológico de 48 peças de mastectomia de pacientes portadoras de {{carcinoma}} da mama, atendidas no Hospital de Câncer da Paraíba - Fundação Napoleão Laureano, durante o período de abril de 2007 a janeiro de 2008, com idade média de 52, 69 ± 10, 72 anos. O CAM foi seccionado separadamente mediante cortes perpendiculares e paralelos a partir da papila, estendendo-se a 2 cm de profundidade do tecido retroareolar (com o intuito de incluir seios lactíferos e ductos coletores e segmentares), seguidos de cortes transversais até a base. RESULTADOS: Identificou-se frequência de envolvimento do CAM por carcinoma invasivo em 14, 58 % dos casos. Pacientes jovens (média 42, 3 ± 4, 7 anos), distância do tumor a mamilo/aréola INTRODUCTION: The {{choice for}} having mastectomy with {{preservation of the}} nipple-areolar complex (NAC), with better esthetic results, depends on the abscence of neoplastic invasion of the NAC. OBJECTIVE: To identify the predictive factors related to neoplastic NAC invasion. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective, analytical and clinical-pathologic study comprising 48 mastectomy specimens of breast carcinoma from patients treated at Cancer Institute of Paraíba - Napoleão Laureano Foundation (Hospital de Câncer da Paraíba - Fundação Napoleão Laureano) from April 2007 to January 2008. The mean age was 52. 69 ± 10. 72. The NAC complex was sectioned separately and perpendicular and parallel cuts were performed from the papilla extending 2 cm deep into the retroareolar tissue (including collecting ducts, <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinuses</b> and segmental ducts), followed by transverse cuts toward the deep margin. RESULTS: The frequency of NAC involvement by invasive carcinoma was 14. 58 %. The following characteristics were associated with {{a higher risk of}} NAC involvement (p < 0. 05) : younger patients (mean age 42. 3 ± 4. 7 years), distance between the tumor and the areola/nipple < 2 cm, size of the areola < 3 cm, histological type (invasive ductal carcinoma associated with comedo type ductal carcinoma in situ), status of axillary lymph nodes (mainly with metastasis in 10 or more lymph nodes), presence of lymphovascular and perineural invasion, and inflammatory infiltrate of intra/peritumoral stroma. Smaller areolas correlated significantly with decreased breast weights (p < 0. 0016), which demonstrated that the breast size had a greater impact on NAC involvement in comparison with the tumor diameter. CONCLUSION: The results of this study enabled us to identify factors associated with an increased risk of neoplastic NAC invasion...|$|R
40|$|An {{intramammary}} device (IMD) {{was adapted}} {{for use in}} ewes; this device was made of abraded polyethylene material (1. 7 mm in diameter, 47 mm long) and formed a 15 -mm-diameter loop in the gland cistern. The IMD was inserted in 1 gland in each of 43 ewes. A significant (P &# 60; 0. 0001) increase in milk somatic cell count (SCC) was observed in glands provided with an IMD. This increase was attributable {{to an increase in}} neutrophil numbers and was observed during the first 12 weeks after insertion. The IMD had a protective effect against experimentally induced staphylococcal mastitis (Staphylococcus aureus and S epidermidis), although different milk SCC were required for protection from each bacterial species in most ewes (10 (6) and 2 x 10 (5) cells/ml, respectively). Histologic studies revealed that the IMD induced local squamous metaplasia in the glandular part of the <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinus.</b> Erythrocytes were found in milk from glands provided with an IMD throughout the studied period (35 days of the 45 -day lactation) and, in some cases, blood clots were observed during the first 2 weeks of lactation. Glands with IMD also had lower milk production and quality at 30 and 32 days of lactation. Eight ewes with IMD were studied throughout a subsequent lactation. Milk from the IMD-containing glands had an increase in SCC, as in the previous lactation period; did not contain blood clots or erythrocytes; and had normal composition (similar to that in glands without the IMD) ...|$|E
40|$|Para a descrição macro e microscópica das glândulas mamárias foram utilizadas três fêmeas de Mão Pelada (Procyon cancrivorus). As amostras das glândulas foram processadas {{conforme}} técnicas rotineiras para histologia. As fêmeas estudadas apresentaram 3 pares de glândulas mamárias, sendo um par de glândula mamária abdominal cranial, um par de abdominal caudal e um par de inguinal. As papilas mamárias apresentaram formato pendular, como os canídeos domésticos. Microscopicamente, a glândula mamária apresentou da porção externa para a interna: epiderme (epitélio estratificado pavimentoso queratinizado), derme (tecido conjuntivo frouxo e tecido conjuntivo denso não modelado), fibras musculares lisas e ductos papilíferos que abrem em vários ósteos papilares em formato de "chuveiro". A porção secretora glandular era caracteristicamente túbulo alveolar, com células cuboidais dispostas em camada simples. Os resultados indicam que o conjunto glandular estudado é semelhante ao da cadela (Cannis familiaris) tanto em seu aspecto macroscópico quanto em seu aspecto microscópico, este fato sugere que podemos utilizar o Mão Pelada e o Cão como modelos similares de estudo, para identificação de patologias relacionadas a este sistema. Three Procyon cancrivorus {{females were}} studied with emphasis for gross and microscopical {{description of the}} mammary glands. Samples of the glands were processed with routine techniques for histology. The females studied presented three pairs of mammary glands: one pair of cranial abdominal mammary glands, a second pair of caudal abdominal and a third one, as inguinal mammary glands. Mammary papillae presented a pendulum shape, as in the domestic dogs. Microscopically, the mammary gland consisted from the external to the internal portion (1) of stratified squamous epithelium of the epidermis, (2) dense irregular connective tissue of the derma, and (3) smooth muscle fibers and papillary ducts that flowed with "shower" shape into the <b>lactiferous</b> <b>sinus.</b> The secretory portion consisted of tubule-alveolar glands with cuboidal cells disposed in a simple layer.
