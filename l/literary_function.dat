Compared with the major characters such as Hikaru Genji, Murasaki no Ue, and Rokujo no Miyasudokoro, however, Yugiri has received less critical attention. Furthermore, narratological studies of Yugiri???s role have not been undertaken. Therefore, this study focuses on investigating the <b>literary</b> <b>functions</b> of Yugiri. Chapter One introduces the narrative structure in the main chapters of The Tale of Genji and proposes that specific narrative techniques create {{a certain sense of}} distance between the reader and the characters. Chapter Two discusses that by focusing on the <b>literary</b> <b>functions</b> of Yugiri, the reader is able to read the text independent of the subjectivity of the narrator.

40|$|Writing and Action in the 17 th Century : On a Corpus of Mazarinades This article studies over 400 mazarinades {{concerning}} the town or {{the inhabitants of}} Bordeaux. The author begins by analyzing the rate of publication of these tracts and {{the circumstances in which}} they were produced. As is the case with most militant literature, the publication of the mazarinades was directly linked to the context of events: a mazarinade was in itself an event. Most of these texts form a network. Some of them are caught in an upward polemical spiral, spilling over from one argument to another in an invariable progression from ideas to men—hence it is important to identify the authors and their sponsors. These investigations reveal the existence of a milieu of frondeurs in Bordeaux whose literary style provides evidence of their political as well as intellectual beha­vior. Finally, in this perspective, the author examines the argumentative and <b>literary</b> <b>functioning</b> of an ill-defined notion, the "people, " and the use of historical references, whose effectiveness bears no relation to the vehemence with which they are introduced.

There are nouvelles which include passages related to the Jacobean pilgrimage which offer valuable testimony on the journey to Compostela and on the importance that France attached to this pilgrimage.

40|$|This study {{responds}} to a double call. Firstly, {{it aims to}} develop an empirical and pedagogical perspective on the integration of language and literature teaching. Secondly, it attempts to construct a language awareness (LA) assessment tool {{to keep pace with}} developments in reading. To this end, the study investigates {{the extent to which a}} stylistic exploration of Shakespeare's language can enhance EFL students' language awareness, which is defined for the present purpose in terms of a number of stylistic devices (e. g. metaphor) which potentially contribute to the 'literariness' of a text. Pedagogical materials and activities were designed accordingly in order to raise awareness of a group of 22 Taiwanese university students over a 10 -week period of intervention. Extracts from Shakespeare's sonnets and plays were used as the medium to sensitise students to various linguistic devices and their <b>literary</b> <b>functions.</b> Further non-Shakespearean materials, both literary and non-literary (e. g. advertisements, newspaper headlines, political speeches) were drawn upon as backup resources to consolidate the stylistic exploration done in the classroom. At the end of the course, students' LA development is demonstrated qualitatively in their course diaries, quantitatively in the researcher-developed LA Test, and different forms of questionnaires students filled in. The study concludes with suggestions regarding the refinement of assessment tools, with implications for future research into the scholarship of teaching...|$|R
