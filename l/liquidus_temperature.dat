25|$|As magma cools, {{minerals}} typically crystallize {{from the}} melt at different temperatures (fractional crystallization). As minerals crystallize, {{the composition of}} the residual melt typically changes. If crystals separate from the melt, then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma. For instance, a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma. Gabbro may have a <b>liquidus</b> <b>temperature</b> near 1,200°C, and the derivative granite-composition melt may have a <b>liquidus</b> <b>temperature</b> as low as about 700°C. Incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting: either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite, a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements. Bowen's reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma.|$|E

The alloys were poured at their <b>liquidus</b> <b>temperatures</b> or about ten degrees below the <b>liquidus</b> <b>temperatures</b> using either batch or semi-continuous casting. Although the compositions of the alloys had considerable effects on details of the resulting microstructure, generally fine, equiaxed primary grains were obtained by controlling the resting time, casting speed and cooling rate. The lower casting temperatures and addition of calcium were effective in preventing burning of Mg without using a protective atmosphere.

40|$|International audienceThe {{composition}} {{dependence of}} glass formation is examined {{in a variety}} of silicate systems that include alkali and alkaline earth alumino-, titano-, ferro- and ferrisilicates.

These correlations imply that vitrification is favored by moderately negative enthalpies of mixing in the melt but made difficult by high configurational heat capacities. The close connection between glass formation and viscosity is reviewed in the light of these melt properties.

50|$|Brazing {{differs from}} welding {{in that it}} does not involve melting the work pieces and from {{soldering}} in using higher temperatures for a similar process, while also requiring much more closely fitted parts than when soldering. The filler metal flows into the gap between close-fitting parts by capillary action. The filler metal is brought slightly above its melting (<b>liquidus)</b> <b>temperature</b> while protected by a suitable atmosphere, usually a flux. It then flows over the base metal (known as wetting) and is then cooled to join the work pieces together. It is similar to soldering, except for the use of higher temperatures.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the solidus and <b>liquidus</b> <b>temperatures</b> of the real-steel grades {{is one of the}} most important technological factors – especially when dealing with the processes of casting and solidification. These temperatures are critical parameters for proper settings of the models (physical or numerical) or in the final stage of an applied research of a real process. A correct setting of a production technology is significantly affecting the final quality of the as-cast steel (billets or ingots). Therefore, this paper is devoted to discussing the findings obtained during a utilization of dynamic thermal-analysis methods to identify the solidus and <b>liquidus</b> <b>temperatures</b> applicable to commercially produced steels. The results obtained with a differential thermal analysis (DTA) for three steel grades and with 3 D differential scanning calorimetry (3 D DSC) for two steel grades are compared with the results of the selected equations commonly used for <b>liquidus</b> and/or solidus <b>temperature</b> calculations. The calculations obtained with the Computherm SW for the discussed steels were also realized. It can be stated that the equilibrium <b>liquidus</b> and solidus <b>temperatures</b> obtained with the above-mentioned methods for each steel grade differ. The differences between the calculated results, the thermodynamic calculations and thermal-analysis results are very unpredictable and vary individually for different steels. These differences are not marginal (tens of Celsius degrees). So, it is sometimes suitable to combine several methods for a proper determination of the <b>liquidus</b> and solidus <b>temperatures</b> for a correct setting of a steel-making process or its modelling. The best solution for a technological process is to obtain the <b>liquidus</b> and solidus <b>temperatures</b> for a concrete-steel grade from a given steelmaking practice – a thermal analysis of a concrete-steel grade is a possible way.

The software package developed at that time consisted of the EQUILIB program of the F*A*C*T computer system with special input/output routines. Since then, Battelle has purchased the entire F*A*C*T computer system, and this fully replaces the earlier package. Furthermore, with the entire F*A*C*T system, additional calculations can be performed such as calculations at fixed O{sub 2 }, SO{sub 2 } etc. pressures, or graphing of output. Furthermore, the public F*A*C*T database of over 5000 gaseous species and condensed phases is now accessible. The private databases for the glass and crystalline phases were developed for Battelle by optimization of thermodynamic and phase diagram data. That is, all available data for 2 - and 3 -component sub-systems of the 9 -component oxide system were collected, and parameters of model equations for the thermodynamic properties were found which best reproduce all the data. For representing the thermodynamic properties of the glass {{as a function of}} composition and temperature, the modified quasichemical model was used.

50|$|In March 1971, the {{practice}} of returning converter slag to the reverberatory furnaces to recover the contained copper was discontinued.

MIM changed its converter slag copper-recovery practice in 1971, and instead of returning all the hot converter slag to the reverberatory furnace, allowed some of the slag to cool slowly and then treated it in the copper concentrator to produce a converter slag concentrate.
