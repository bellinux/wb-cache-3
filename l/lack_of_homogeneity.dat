40|$|Although {{the exact}} {{expressions}} for the extinction probabilities of the Interacting Branching Collision Processes (IBCP) are very recently given by Chen et al [4], {{some of these}} expressions are very complicated and hence useful information regarding asymptotic behaviour, for example, is hardly to be obtained. Also, these exact expressions take very different forms for different cases and thus seem <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity.</b> In this paper, we show that the asymptotic behaviour of these extremely complicated and tangled expressions for extinction probabilities of IBCP follows an elegant and homogenous power law which takes a very simple form. In fact {{we are able to}} show that if the extinction is not certain then the extinction probabilities {an} follows an harmonious and simple asymptotic law of an ∼ knnc as n→ ∞ where k and are two constants and c is the unique positive zero of the C(s) and C(s) is the generating function of the infinitesimal collision rates. Moreover, the interesting and important quantity takes a very simple and uniform form which could be interpreted as the “spectrum”, ranging from minus infinity to positive infinity...|$|R
40|$|A huge body of {{empirical}} and theoretical literature has emerged {{on the relationship}} between exchange rate uncertainty and international trade. In empirical studies the estimated impacts of exchange rate uncertainty on trade figures are at most weak and often ambiguous with respect to their directions. Almost all empirical contributions on the topic start from the assumption of some linear relationship, the potentional of nonlinearity or state dependence of causal links between volatility and trade has been ignored yet. In addition, widely used regression models have not been evaluated in terms of ex-ante forecasting. In this paper we analyze the impact of exchange rate uncertainty on specific categories of exports and imports for 13 industrialized economies towards the rest of the world. Our results support the view that the relationship of interests might be nonlinear and, moreover, <b>lacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> across countries, economic sectors and when contrasting imports vs. exports.

50|$|Later work by Putnam also {{suggests}} that social capital, and the associated growth of public trust are inhibited by immigration and rising racial diversity in communities. Putnam's study regarding the issue argued that in American areas with a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity,</b> some individuals neither participated in bonding nor bridging social capital. In societies where immigration is high (USA) or where ethnic heterogeneity is high (Eastern Europe), {{it was found that}} citizens lacked in both kinds of social capital and were overall far less trusting of others than members of homogenous communities were found to be. <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> led to people withdrawing from even their closest groups and relationships, creating an atomized society as opposed to a cohesive community. These findings challenge previous beliefs that exposure to diversity strengthens social capital, either through bridging social gaps between ethnicities or strengthening in-group bonds. It is very important for policy makers to monitor the level of perceived socio-economic threat from immigrants because negative attitudes towards immigrants make integration difficult and affect social capital.|$|E

Empirical findings about the impact of FX uncertainty on trade figures are at best weak and often ambiguous with respect to its direction. Almost all empirical contributions assume and estimate a linear relationship. Possible nonlinearity or state dependence of causal links between FX uncertainty and trade has been mostly ignored yet. In addition, widely used regression models have not been evaluated in terms of ex-ante forecasting. In this paper we analyze the impact of FX uncertainty on sectoral categories of multilateral exports and imports for 15 industrialized economies. We particularly provide a comparison of linear and nonlinear models with respect to ex-ante forecasting. In terms of average ranks of absolute forecast errors nonlinear models outperform both, a common linear model and some specification building on the assumption that FX uncertainty and trade growth are uncorrelated.
