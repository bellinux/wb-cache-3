500|$|The movie's strange title {{originated}} from something said by Ringo Starr, who described {{it this way}} {{in an interview with}} disc jockey Dave Hull in 1964: [...] "We went to do a job, and we'd worked all day and we happened to work all night. I came up still thinking it was day I suppose, and I said, 'It's been a hard day ...' and I <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> saw it was dark so I said, '... night!' So we came to A Hard Day's Night." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} few months after its installation, the PDP-1 {{programming}} community at MIT focused on simpler programs to work out how to create software for the computer. The community had heard of the Spacewar concept, however, and understood that Russell would spearhead the development of it. [...] When members of the community began to feel the time was right to start work on the game, Russell, nicknamed [...] "Slug" [...] because of his tendency to procrastinate, began providing various excuses as to why he could not start programming the game. One of these was the lack of a trigonometric function routine needed to calculate the trajectories of the spacecraft. This prompted Alan Kotok of TMRC to call DEC, who informed him that they had such a routine already written. Kotok drove to DEC to pick up a tape containing the code, slammed it down in front of Russell, and asked what other excuses he had. Russell, later explaining that [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> I didn't find an excuse, so I had to settle down and do some figuring," [...] started writing the code in December 1961. The game was developed to meet three precepts Russell, Graetz, and Wiitanen had developed for creating a program that functioned equally well as an entertainment experience for the players and as a demonstration for spectators: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game. It took Russell, with assistance from the other programmers—including Bob Saunders and Steve Piner (but not Wiitanen, who had been called up by the United States Army Reserve)—about 200 man-hours to write the first version of Spacewar, around six weeks to develop the basic game.|$|E

[...] Guitarist Bob Weir stated, [...] "We <b>looked</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> UC Santa Cruz seems the best possible home. If you ever wrote the Grateful Dead a letter, you'll probably find it there!" ...|$|E

She starred as Queen Clarisse Marie Renaldi and reprised the {{role in a}} sequel, [...] (2004). In The Princess Diaries 2, Andrews sang on film {{for the first time}} since having throat surgery. The song, [...] "Your Crowning Glory" [...] (a duet with teen idol Raven-Symoné), was set in a limited range of an octave to accommodate her recovering voice. The film's music supervisor, Dawn Soler, recalled that Andrews [...] "nailed the song on the first take. I <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> I saw grips with tears in their eyes." ...|$|E

[...] The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, [...] "Who then can be saved?" [...] Jesus looked at them and said, [...] "With man this is im{{possible}}, but not with God; all things are possible with God." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the initial}} {{draft of the}} screenplay, the {{original}} series cast appeared in a prologue, and Guinan served as the bridge between the two generations. The opening shot {{would have been the}} entire original series cast crammed into an elevator aboard the Enterprise-B, happy to be back together. The Enterprise-D's end also appeared—the saucer crash had first been proposed as the cliffhanger for Moore's original seventh-season finale [...] "All Good Things...", which eventually became the series finale. Kirk's death was initially developed in Braga, Moore and Berman's story sessions. Moore recalled that [...] "we wanted to aim high, do something different and big... We knew we had to have a strong Picard story arc, so what are the profound things in a man's life he has to face? Mortality tops the list." [...] After the idea of killing off a Next Generation cast member was vetoed, someone suggested that Kirk die instead. Moore recalled that [...] "we all sorta <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> said, 'That might be it.' [...] " [...] The studio and Shatner himself had few concerns about the plot point.|$|E
