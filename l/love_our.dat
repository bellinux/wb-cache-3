500|$|Wollstonecraft applies this feminist {{critique}} to Burke's language {{throughout the}} Reflections. As Johnson argues, [...] "her pamphlet {{as a whole}} refutes the Burkean axiom 'to make us <b>love</b> <b>our</b> country, our country ought to be lovely'"; Wollstonecraft successfully challenges Burke's rhetoric of the beautiful with {{the rhetoric of the}} rational. She also demonstrates how Burke embodies the worst of his own ideas. He becomes the hysterical, illogical, feminine writer, and Wollstonecraft becomes the rational, masculine writer. Ironically, in order to effect this transposition, Wollstonecraft herself becomes passionate at times, for example, in her description of slavery (quoted above).|$|E
