5|$|Balzac {{suffered}} from health problems throughout his life, possibly {{due to his}} intense writing schedule. His relationship with his family was often strained by financial and personal drama, and he <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one friend over critical reviews. In 1850, Balzac married Ewelina Hańska, a Polish aristocrat and his longtime love; he died in Paris five months later.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on water supplies originating outside its borders, making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change. Droughts are frequent and devastating. Several years of droughts {{during the last decade}} have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. A drought in 2009 was the worst drought in more than 50 years. Many cattle died of hunger, and huge swaths of soy, corn and wheat fields were affected. It was estimated that the country <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> US$5billion from the drought. A drought in 2011 affected farming of soy and corn, causing losses of US$2.5billion.|$|E
5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht had <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> {{a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided {{to remain in}} the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E

5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} heavy casualties. The Polish {{casualties were}} particularly severe. In {{a relatively short}} time the Polish Second Army <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 22 percent of its personnel and 57 percent of its tanks and armored vehicles (about 200 total). Official estimates claimed about 18,000 casualties (including almost 5,000 dead). Some other estimates give the Polish casualties as up to 25,000. According to Polish historian Zbigniew Wawer, this was the most bloody battle that the Polish Army had been involved in since the battle of Bzura in 1939.|$|E
5|$|During World War I many Shetlanders {{served in}} the Gordon Highlanders, a further 3,000 {{served in the}} Merchant Navy, and more than 1,500 in a special local naval reserve. The 10th Cruiser Squadron was {{stationed}} at Swarbacks Minn (the stretch of water {{to the south of}} Muckle Roe), and during a single year from March 1917 more than 4,500 ships sailed from Lerwick as part of an escorted convoy system. In total, Shetland <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 500 men, a higher proportion than any other part of Britain, and there were further waves of emigration in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, a {{time when}} federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful, Albany did not have growth in its economy or infrastructure. It <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 20 percent of its {{population}} during the Corning years, as people moved to newer housing in the suburbs, followed {{by most of the}} downtown businesses moving there as well. While cities across the country grappled with similar issues, the problems were magnified in Albany: interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably.|$|E

5|$|Endara's term {{in office}} saw marked {{economic}} recovery from the nation's years of military rule. During his presidency, Panama had an average annual economic growth of 8%. However, unemployment also rose near 19%. In February 1990, the overweight Endara began a hunger strike in the Metropolitan Cathedral {{to call attention to}} the nation's poverty and to pressure US President George H. W. Bush to dispense previously pledged American aid. In the course of the strike, he <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> thirty of his two hundred and sixty pounds.|$|E
5|$|First-class cricket resumed in 1945–46 {{after the}} Allied victory, and Brown began the post-war phase {{of his career}} with a steady season, scoring 604 runs at 46.46 with five half-centuries in seven matches. This placed him second to Sid Barnes in the run-scoring aggregates. His best effort was a 98 against South Australia, denied a century by a run out. Queensland <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> they won, with two {{victories}} and three losses. At {{the end of the}} season, Brown captained an Australian side on a tour of New Zealand, and all five matches resulted in convincing victories.|$|E

After his release and rehabilitation, he joined the Special Air Service (SAS) and went on to serve in various conflicts around the world, hunting communist guerrillas in Malaya, suppressing rebellions in Oman and Aden, and conducting deniable cross-border reconnaissance and raids during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation.|$|E
5|$|He {{was named}} {{manager of the}} team in 1905, but did not receive {{additional}} pay; he was, however, offered a bonus if the team didn't lose money. In 1905, Tenney tried to sign William Clarence Matthews, an African-American middle infielder from Harvard University, to a contract. Tenney later retracted his offer due to pressure from MLB players. Defensively, he led the majors in errors committed by a first baseman and finished second in most putouts for any position. Tenney led the 1906 Beaneaters to a 49–102 record. For the second straight year, the Boston team <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 100 games.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Mercer, {{leading the}} American advance guard, {{encountered}} British soldiers from Princeton {{under the command}} of Charles Mawhood. The British troops engaged Mercer and in the ensuing battle, Mercer was mortally wounded. Washington sent reinforcements under General John Cadwalader, which were successful in driving Mawhood and the British from Princeton, with many of them fleeing to Cornwallis in Trenton. The British <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one quarter of their force in the battle, and American morale rose with the victory.|$|E

He did, however, win the Madrid Masters after Nishikori got injured while dominating Nadal 6–2, 4–2 in that final. Nadal went on to defend his French Open title, defeating Murray in the semi-final and Djokovic in the final.|$|E
5|$|Upon Tallon's {{return to}} Australia, {{he made an}} unbeaten 146 in Bradman's Testimonial match at the MCG in December 1948. He {{featured}} in a tenth-wicket partnership of 100 with Geff Noblet, who scored only nine as Tallon farmed the strike effectively. This saw the match scores tied on the last ball of the match. Tallon also made seven dismissals for the match. Queensland <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> they won during the season, but Tallon continued to be productive, scoring 453 runs at 34.85 and making 26 dismissals in seven matches.|$|E
5|$|Debates over {{rules and}} {{schedules}} {{might have been}} solvable had the league achieved economic stability but losses amongst American teams were drastic and widespread. In 1995 alone, Fred Anderson estimated that the U.S. teams had collectively <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> US$20 million. The Baltimore Sun provides a similar estimate of US$21 million. The $10 million estimated loss in Birmingham was the most substantial, followed by US$4 to $6 million estimated for Anderson's Texans. Memphis and Shreveport losses were estimated at about US$3 million apiece. The Baltimore losses were comparatively modest at US$1 to $1.5 million, but stung the league given {{the prestige of the}} franchise.|$|E

5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E
5|$|In June 1627, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham led an {{expedition}} to the island of Île de Ré to support the Huguenots besieged in La Rochelle by King Louis XIII of France. With no standing army, Buckingham's forces were largely volunteers and mercenaries. Since public opinion in England (particularly among extreme Protestants) supported the Huguenots, a number of well connected gentry came forward. The volunteers to join Buckingham included Temple, his elder brother John {{and other members of}} his family. The expedition to the Isle of Ré, was a disaster and altogether, Buckingham <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 5,000 men in the campaign out of a force of 7,000. Among those who died was Temple's brother.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1999, Color Air {{terminated}} all {{flights and}} ceased operations. On {{the day of}} the termination, the stock price of Braathens increased by 16%. Immediately following the bankruptcy, the two airlines increased their prices. Subsequently, Braathens increased their ticket price by 15%, but stated that this {{had nothing to do with}} the elimination of competition, since the price increase was not on any Oslo routes. In November, Braathens started to remove routes, and announced they would increase prices by 20%. They also reintroduced the Flag of Norway on the tail, which since the rebranding had been replaced by a silver, abstract wing. Both Braathens and SAS <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> NOK1 billion in 1999, totaling the cost of the price war between the three airlines to exceed NOK 3 billion.|$|E
