40|$|AbstractIntroductionProphylaxis with plasma-derived or {{recombinant}} <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII {{is beneficial}} in severe factor VII deficiency. To understand why prophylactic treatment with both products is efficacious, {{we conducted a}} pharmacokinetic study. Materials and MethodsTen factor VII deficient patients were treated with either recombinant activated (20 μg/kg) or plasma-derived (25 IU/kg) factor VII in a cross-over design. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed through <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII activity, factor VII clotting activity, and factor VII antigen levels on depicted time points. ResultsFactor VII activity half-lifes, determined by non-compartmental and one-compartmental analysis (results in brackets), were shorter for recombinant activated (1. 4 h; 0. 7 h) than for plasma-derived factor VII (6. 8 h; 3. 2 h); both recombinant activated (5. 1 h; 2. 1 h and plasma-derived factor VII (5. 8 h; 3. 2 h) resulted in longer half-lives of <b>factor</b> VII antigen. <b>Activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII half-lives (based on <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII activity levels) were significantly higher compared to factor VII clotting activity (1. 6 h; 0. 9 h). Volumes of distribution were significantly higher for <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII (236 ml/kg; 175 ml/kg, measured by <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII) as compared to plasma-derived factor VII (206 ml/kg; 64 ml/kg, measured by factor FVII activity), suggesting a plasma- and extracellular fluid distribution for recombinant <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII. ConclusionsRecombinant <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII showed significantly shorter half-lifes than plasma-derived factor VII. Volumes of distribution were significantly higher for treatment with recombinant <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII. The longer half-life for plasma-derived factor VII, compared to recombinant <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII, and the increased volume of distribution for recombinant <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII, compared to plasma-derived factor VII may further elucidate the beneficial effect of prophylactic treatment of both products...|$|R

Gastric juice was collected using a nasogastric tube after overnight fast in basal condition for 60 minutes, then under pentagastrin infusion (6 micrograms/kg/hr for 60 minutes). Platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> was detected at low concentration in 4 / 13 subjects under basal condition (mean (SEM) 1. 2 (0. 6) pg/hr) while high concentrations of lyso platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> (6. 1 (1. 8) microgram/hr) and of alkyl-acyl-glycerophosphocholine (AAGPC) (11. 5 (3) micrograms/hr) were found in 13 and 11 subjects, respectively. Platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> was not detected during pentagastrin infusion, while lyso platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> and alkyl-acyl-glycerophosphocholine were detected in 13 and in 12 subjects, respectively.

40|$|Epidermal {{thymocyte}} activating factor (ETAF) is spontaneously {{released into}} the media by PAM 212 and A 431 cell lines and cultured normal human keratinocytes. ETAF from all 3 cell types can substitute for interleukin 1 (IL- 1) in the augmentation of proliferation of a helper T-cell clone (D 10. G 4. 1) induced by mitogen. Hydrocortisone (HC) substantially reduces the release of ETAF by these keratinocytes and, further, appears to induce the release of an inhibitor <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> activity of IL- 1. Irradiation with UVC causes increased ETAF release into the media. Hydrocortisone abrogates this effect. Thus HC reduces both constitutive and elicited release of ETAF.

Data relating to 829 non-surgical bleeding episodes were entered into the Glanzmann Thrombasthenia Registry (severe/moderate: 216 / 613; spontaneous/post-traumatic: 630 / 199). Recombinant <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII alone was used in 124 / 829 bleeds, recombinant <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII+antifibrinolytics in 107 / 829, platelets±antifibrinolytics in 312 / 829, antifibrinolytics alone in 219 / 829, and recombinant <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII+platelets±antifibrinolytics in 67 / 829. The proportion of successful treatments to stop bleeding was 91. 0 % in cases treated with recombinant <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII only, 82. 7 % for recombinant <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII+antifibrinolytics, 72. 7 % for treatment with recombinant <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII+platelets±antifibrinolytics, 78. 8 % for platelets±antifibrinolytics and 84. 7 % for antifibrinolytics alone. Treatment failure was documented in 18 bleeding events (2 % of the total treatments), the majority of which were in patients receiving treatment with antifibrinolytics; bleeding re-started in 6 % of bleeds after initial effective treatment. Thirty-five adverse events were reported, none of which was a thromboembolic event. Among treatments that included recombinant <b>activated</b> <b>factor</b> VII, only one patient reported three possibly drug-related non-serious adverse events (nausea, dyspnea and headache).

The possible role of LAF activity as a marker of MS progression has yet to be determined...|$|E
40|$|Cyclosporin A (Cs A) exerted a dose-related {{inhibitory}} effect on antigen (ovalbumin, OVA) and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) -induced transformation of guinea-pig lymph node cells (LNC). Whereas 0. 05 micrograms/ml {{was sufficient to}} depress these responses markedly, it required 100 -fold this concentration of Cs A to inhibit the production of <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> (LAF) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated peritoneal macrophages. Addition of Cs A together with insoluble concanavalin A (iCon A) to LNC cultures resulted in suppressed lymphokine production, as assessed by measurement of migration inhibition factor (MIF), the generation of macrophage procoagulant activity (MPCA) {{and the release of}} lymphocyte-derived-macrophage chemotactic factor (LDCF). Cs A also inhibited MIF and procoagulant production by sensitized peritoneal exudate cells in response to antigen, at the same concentrations which blocked lymphocyte transformation. In contrast, Cs A had no direct effect on the migration of peritoneal cells from capillary tubes, or on the responses of macrophages to preformed MIF, the lymphokine inducing MPCA or LDCF. Overnight incubation of macrophages with Cs A did, however, result in mild inhibition of their basal level of procoagulant activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} inhaled {{platelet}} <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> {{were compared with}} those of inhaled methacholine (control) on airway calibre, airway responsiveness to methacholine and isoprenaline, and circulating cells in eight subjects with mild, stable asthma. Platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> was given in six doses at 15 minute intervals and airway response measured as change in partial expiratory flow at 30 % of vital capacity (Vp 30). Platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> caused a fall in Vp 30, the mean (SEM) maximum percentage fall being 28. 9 (4. 2) five minutes after the first dose (12 micrograms) and 50. 9 (8. 0) after the second dose (24 micrograms). Tachyphylaxis occurred, however, with the four subsequent doses of inhaled platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor.</b> There was transient neutropenia after the first dose, from a mean of 3. 6 (0. 2) x 10 (9) to 2. 2 (0. 5) x 10 (9) neutrophils/l; this response also showed tachyphylaxis with subsequent doses. The mean PC 40 (the concentration of methacholine needed to cause a 40 % fall in Vp 30) was unchanged one, three, and seven days after administration of platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor.</b> There was no significant correlation between baseline PC 40 methacholine and the maximal fall in Vp 30 after either the first (12 micrograms) or the second dose (24 micrograms) of platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor.</b> The control challenge with methacholine produced a degree of bronchoconstriction similar to that of platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> but was not associated with any significant change in bronchial responsiveness or in circulating cells. The bronchodilator response to inhaled isoprenaline measured three days after inhalation of platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> and of methacholine was similar after the two challenges. Thus asthmatic subjects who are hyperresponsive to methacholine show a similar bronchoconstrictor response to platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor,</b> as has been observed in normal subjects; overall this did not cause airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> in acute pancreatitis was examined by determining the tissue content of endogenous platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> and the protective effects of TCV- 309, a highly selective platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> blocker, against caerulein induced pancreatitis in rats. Infusion of caerulein (10 micrograms/kg/h) {{for five hours}} resulted in about 70 % increase in pancreatic weight, 22 % rise in protein content, 50 % reduction in tissue blood flow, nine fold increase in tissue level of platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> and 165 % rise in plasma amylase as well as histological evidence of acute pancreatitis. Such infusion of caerulein in chronic pancreatic fistula rats caused a marked increase in protein output from basal secretion of 10 mg/ 30 minutes to 40 mg/ 30 minutes in the first hour of infusion followed by a decline in protein output to 15 - 20 mg/ 30 minutes in the following hours of the experiment. Exogenous platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> (50 micrograms/kg) injected ip produced similar alterations in weight, protein content, blood flow, and histology of the pancreas but the increment in serum amylase was significantly smaller and pancreatic secretion was reduced below the basal level. TCV- 309 (50 micrograms/kg) given ip before caerulein or platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> administration significantly reduced the biochemical and morphological alterations caused by caerulein and abolished those induced by exogenous platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor.</b> These results indicate that platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> {{plays an important role}} in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis probably by reducing the blood flow and increasing vascular permeability in the pancreas...|$|R
40|$|Generation of {{platelet}} <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> by intestinal mucosal {{epithelial cells}} and lamina propria mononuclear cells was evaluated to elucidate the possible role of this mediator in {{the pathogenesis of}} inflammatory bowel disease. Epithelial and lamina propria mononuclear cells were isolated from surgical specimens from control, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis patients. Platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> was extracted from highly purified cell preparations with 80 % ethanol after stimulation with and without 0. 2 uM calcium ionophore A 23187 and was measured by platelet aggregation assay. Both cell types generated platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> activity and this was generally comparable for epithelial and lamina propria cells. Basal and stimulated platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> activity of epithelial and lamina propria cells from ulcerative colitis but not Crohn's disease patients was appreciably {{higher than that of}} control. Stimulation with calcium ionophore increased appreciably platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> activity in lamina propria cells from all groups. In contrast, only epithelial cells from ulcerative colitis showed an appreciable increase after calcium ionophore induction. These results suggest that epithelial cells are important contributors to intestinal platelet <b>activating</b> <b>factor</b> generation under normal and inflammatory conditions and that epithelial cells actively play a part in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis...|$|R
