40|$|Five {{vacation}} segments having distinct vacation preferences {{were identified}} using respondents to a mail survey. These segments {{were found to}} differ both demo-graphically and {{with respect to their}} magazine readership patterns. Each vacation segment is described and some implications of the findings are presented. The use of lifestyle profiling in tourism research, examining differences in the activities, interests, and opinions of tourist groups, has blossomed in recent years. Hawes (1977) and Abbey (1979) both examined <b>life-style</b> <b>profiles</b> of tourists and concluded that life-style variables were superior to demographics in detailing traveler preferences. Since publication of these findings, travel researchers have found lifestyle differences between visitors and non-visitors to national parks (Mayo 1975), between the RV segment {{and the rest of the}} market (Hawes 1978), in tourists t...|$|E

40|$|AIM: This {{study was}} carried out descriptively {{with the aim of}} {{determining}} the variables affecting healthy life style behaviors of the nurses. METHOD: The study was carried on between the date&# 146;s may-June 2007 at Ataturk University Yakutiye Research Hospital on Suleyman Demirel Training and Research Hospitals. The research {{was carried out}} with 205 nurses. In the collection of the data survey form including personal behaviors of the nurses, and the Health Promotion <b>Life-Style</b> <b>Profile</b> prepared by researchers were used in the direction of literature. RESULTS: Total score of Health Promotion <b>Life-Style</b> <b>Profile</b> of the nurses participating in the research was 121. 20 &# 177; 18. 30, and sub-group scale scores; health responsibility is 20. 88 &# 177; 3. 76 and physical activities is 14. 04 &# 177; 4. 22, and nutritional habit is 19. 57 &# 177; 3. 80, and mental development is 25. 36 &# 177; 4. 47, and relations between persons is 24. 04 &# 177; 4. 07, and stress management is 17. 09 &# 177; 3. 59. There was statistically significant distinction between total score average and the situation of hawing children, and working duration and education level of the nurses (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: At the end of the result, it was determined that average of Health Promotion <b>Life-Style</b> <b>Profile</b> of the nurses was middle level and that the most common and most noticeable health life style behaviors of the nurses was mental development, and that the least applied health life style behaviors of the nurses was physical activities.

40|$|Background: Health-related Habits (HrH) {{are a major}} {{priority}} in healthcare. However there is little agreement on whether exercise, diet, smoking or dental hygiene are better described as lifestyles, habits or behaviors, and on what is their hierarchical relationship. This research is aimed at representing the basic concepts which are assumed to constitute the conceptual framework enabling us to interpret and organize the field of HrH. Methods: A group of 29 experts with different backgrounds agreed on the definition and hierarchy of HrH following an iterative process which involved framing analysis and nominal group techniques. Results: Formal definitions of health-related behavior, habit, <b>life-style</b> and <b>life-style</b> <b>profile</b> were produced. In addition a series of basic descriptors were identified: health reserve, capital, risk and load. Six main categories of HrH were chosen based on relevance to longevity: diet/exercise, vitality/stress, sleep, cognition, substance use and other risk. Attributes of HrH are clinical meaningfulness, quantifiability, temporal stability, associated morbidity, and unitarity (non-redundancy). Two qualifiers (polarity and stages of change) have also been described. Conclusions: The concepts represented here {{lay the groundwork for}} the development of clinical and policy tools related to HrH and lifestyle. An adaptation of this system to define targets of health interventions and to develop the classification of person factors in ICF may be needed in the future...|$|R
40|$|Background : In {{the present}} era with a drastic change in {{lifestyle}} of every individual, weight gain and obesity are posing a growing threat to health in countries {{all over the}} world. Once a problem of affluence, obesity growing {{in many developing countries}} also due to decreased physical activity, sedentary lifestyle, altered eating habits, increased fat content in diet and decreased social activities. It is therefore imperative that rising incidence of obesity is controlled by tracking the trend of obesity since childhood and by BCC activities. Aims & Objectives : To study the <b>life-style</b> <b>profile</b> of high school students and association of lifestyle with Body Mass Index. Material & Methods : A cross-sectional study was conducted in 565 high school students. Students were interviewed regarding daily activity, physical activity, hours of television and computer viewing and routine food habits. The anthropometric measurements were done. BMI was calculated according to WHO 2007 criteria. Results: The prevalence of overweight in students was found to be 5. 84 % and obesity was 0. 35 %. There was statistical evidence that the overweight students were associated with higher socio economic status group (p= 0. 000107), decreased physical activity (p= 0. 0001; OR- 10. 88), increased consumption of junk food (p= 0. 0005817; OR- 3. 4) and more hours of viewing television/ computer (p= 0. 00555; OR- 2. 99). </p...|$|R

METHODS: This descriptive study of data types of the Gulhane Military Medical Academy (GATA) Hospital cardiology clinic in December 2009 - February 2010 were collected. The study group, at least 6 months before the diagnosis of CAD area, {{between the ages of}} 20 - 65 individuals who accept and participate in the study (n = 300) formed. Sociodemographic characteristics and health behaviors of the personal information form for the 33 -item, 52 -item scale of a healthy lifestyle behaviors and health status of the single-item scale working group of the detection technique applied to the face-to-face interview. The aim of the study, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) for the development of health behaviors in the case of individuals {{diagnosed with}} the identification, health status and related factors to determine the levels of detection. The statistical analysis techniques such as Mann Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis were used for the comparison. RESULTS: Of the group 57, 7 % were males, 46, 3 % were 50 - 59 years of age and 56, 3 % were higher education graduates. As regard to total Health Promotion <b>Life-Style</b> <b>Profile</b> Scale scores statistically significant differences had been found between age, gender, education, disease period, occupation and chronic condition groups. As regard to the average PHSS scores statistically significant differences had been found between age, education, body mass index, disease period, occupation, chronic condition and CAD related course groups (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Healthy lifestyle behaviors before planning training programs, individual models of health behavior and the behavior of individuals using the analyzed factors affecting [...] [TAF Prev Med Bull 2012; 11 (3. 000) : 287 - 298...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2011 Informa UK Ltd. Background: Atherosclerosis -a {{major cause}} of {{vascular}} disease, including ischemic heart disease (IHD), is a pathology that has a two-fold higher mortality rate in the Azorean Islands compared to mainland Portugal. Aim: This cross-sectional study investigated the role of genetic variation in the prevalence of atherosclerosis in this population. Subjects and methods: A total of 305 individuals were characterized for polymorphisms in eight susceptibility genes for atherosclerosis: ACE, PAI 1, NOS 3, LTA, FGB, ITGB 3, PON 1 and APOE. Data were analysed with respect to phenotypic characteristics such as blood pressure, lipid <b>profile,</b> <b>life-style</b> risk factors and familial history of myocardial infarction. Results: In the total sample, frequencies for hypercholestrolemic, hypertensive and obese individuals were 63. 6 %, 39. 3 % and 23. 3 %, respectively. The genetic profile {{was similar to that}} observed in other European populations, namely in mainland Portugal. No over-representation of risk alleles was evidenced in this sample. Conclusions: One has to consider the possibility of an important non-genetic influence on the high cholesterolemia present in the Azorean population. Since diet is the most important life-style risk factor for dyslipidemia, studies aiming to evaluate the dietary characteristics of this population and its impact on serum lipid levels will be of major importance.
