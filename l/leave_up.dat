5|$|Combat in {{the game}} is similar to its predecessor, with the main series of {{missions}} beginning after an opening tutorial. The game features ground-based hack-and-slash gameplay and aerial combat. In ground combat, the player controls multiple characters, switching between them via the pause menu {{in order to use}} their different weapons. The characters use physical attacks using character weapons for short-range battle, while magical attacks are used for long-range attacks and groups of enemies. The magical attacks vary between the playable characters. Weapons, characters and magical abilities <b>leave</b> <b>up</b> and grow stronger as the player gains experience points in combat: weapons have a four-level cap.|$|E
5|$|After the {{partition}} Rejtan withdrew from political life. He never married. He {{spent the rest}} of his days in a small estate at Hruszówka, where he died on August 8, 1780. His mental health had deteriorated; according to some due to distress with the loss of a part of his homeland, but rumours about his erratic behavior date to soon after the Partition Sejm begun in 1773, before its final motions were passed in 1776. He {{is said to have been}} escorted by his brothers from Warsaw on 19 March 1775 after he had a fit, and was locked in a small family's mansion which he would never <b>leave</b> <b>up</b> till his death. Eventually he committed suicide, cutting himself with glass (most detailed accounts say he swallowed it, to prevent being taken by pursuing Russian soldiers). His exact place of burial is unknown, and exhumation in Hruszówka in 1930 failed to conclusively find his grave.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 2006, Dick Cheney shot Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old Texas attorney, while {{participating}} in a quail hunt at Armstrong ranch in Kenedy County, Texas. Secret Service agents and medical aides, who were traveling with Cheney, came to Whittington's assistance and treated his birdshot wounds to his right cheek, neck, and chest. An ambulance standing by for the Vice President took Whittington to nearby Kingsville before he was flown by helicopter to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital. On February 14, 2006, Whittington had a non-fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due {{to at least one}} lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart. Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets, doctors decided to <b>leave</b> <b>up</b> to 30 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body rather than try to remove them.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{qualitative and quantitative}} chromatographic analysis (GC/MS) of the lipophilic fraction extracted from leaves, inflorescences and rhizomes of Silphium perfoliatum L. collected in 1998 - 2000. It was shown that the extracts of leaves and inflorescences are similar in composition, containing among their main constituents: α-amyrine (up to 13. 9 % of total components in <b>leaves,</b> <b>up</b> to 11. 3 % in inflorescences), heptacosane (up to 7. 1 % in <b>leaves,</b> <b>up</b> to 7. 6 % in inflorescences), stigmasterol (up to 8. 1 % in <b>leaves,</b> <b>up</b> to 2. 2 % in inflorescences), γ-sitosterol (up to 6. 9 % in <b>leaves,</b> <b>up</b> to 2. 2 % in inflorescences), β-amyrine (up to 4. 1 % in <b>leaves,</b> <b>up</b> to 5. 8 % in inflorescences), β-caryophyllene (up to 2. 6 % in <b>leaves,</b> <b>up</b> to 1. 5 % in inflorescences), caryophyllene oxide (up to 4. 4 % in <b>leaves,</b> <b>up</b> to 2. 9 % in inflorescences), germacrene D (up to 13. 8 % in <b>leaves,</b> <b>up</b> to 9. 7 % in inflorescences) and α-pinene (up to 3. 3 % in <b>leaves,</b> <b>up</b> to 2. 4 % in inflorescences). The chemical composition of lipophilic extract of rhizomes significantly {{differs from that of}} leaves and inflorescences. The following compounds can be counted among the dominant ones occurring in rhizome extracts: diterpene of labdane type - 16 -acetoxycarterochaetol (up to 45 %) and sesquiterpenes - 7 -b-H-silphiperfol- 5 -ene (up to 9. 1 %), 7 -a-H-silphiperfol- 5 -ene (up to 10. 7 %), d-elemene (up to 7. 6 %), isocomene (up to 5. 6 %), germacrene D (up to 5. 2 %) and modhephene (up to 5. 1 %) ...|$|R

25|$|Wolf hunting proponents {{have drawn}} {{attention}} to the fact that wolves will on occasion commit acts of surplus killing when within the confines of human-made livestock shelters. Rare incidents of surplus killing by wolves in Minnesota are reported to <b>leave</b> <b>up</b> to 35 sheep killed and injured in flocks and losses of 50 to 200 birds in turkey flocks. In spite of the low percentage of attacks on livestock in Minnesota, farms in wolf territories and environments may become more susceptible to depredation under certain conditions. These conditions include larger farm size, increased numbers of cattle, an increased distance from human management, and improper disposal of livestock carcasses. While loss of livestock by wolves makes up only a small percentage of total losses in North America, surveys in Eurasia show some instances where wolf predation was frequent. In some areas of the former Soviet Union, wolves cause serious damage to watermelon plantations. Wolves will usually only take ripe melons after giving test bites, which can render even unripe fruits worthless for future consumption. Sometimes, up to 20% of the total watermelon crop can be destroyed on one raid.|$|E
