5000|$|This is {{possible}} by constructing a balancing reservoir by separating some {{area of the}} NS reservoir with a new dam across the Bhimanapalli Vagu tributary at [...] just upstream of the Puttamgandi PH approach channel. This new dam with FRL 590 ft MSL, would not submerge any additional area other than the area already submerged by the NS reservoir. The water inflows from the Bhimanapalli Vagu tributary joining the NS reservoir are first impounded by the new dam and if found excess over flows into the downstream NS reservoir. This new balancing reservoir's <b>live</b> <b>capacity</b> is nearly 6 Tmcft above the 502 ft MDDL which is equal to six months water supply to the Hyderabad city. This reservoir would have provision to receive water from the Puttamgandi PH when inflows from the Bhimanapalli Vagu tributary is not satisfactory and water is at adequate level in NS reservoir during monsoon months. When water level of NS reservoir goes below the 502 ft MSL, water is fed to the Puttamgandi PH approach channel from the new balancing reservoir for pumping water needs of Hyderabad city.

50|$|The river has an {{extensive}} course measuring up to 373 km in length making it {{longer than the}} River Thames of Great Britain. Very close to its origin, it is dammed through the Nevpur Medium Irrigation Projectwithin the Kannad Taluka, Aurangabad district.Collecting the tributary Anjana within the Sillod taluka, it ends its short course within Aurangabad and enters the Jalna where it is consecutively joined by two rivers, Girija at Walsakhalsa and Kelana at Jafrabad. Beyond this the river enters the Buldana district where it spreads out into the backwaters of the Khadakpurna dam and also receives another small tributary called Damna.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, a strong {{foundation}} for the professional discipline of bulk solids handling has been provided, but so far, the theories for predicting funnel-flow are still quite empirical. In most cases, only two-dimensional stress field models are applied, which overestimate the stable pipe or rathole dimensions defining {{the core of the}} funnel and lead to draw-down and <b>live</b> <b>capacity</b> determinations, which are too conservative. More recently, Roberts [1] introduced a new, more realistic, hoop stress theory based on the three-dimensional stress state occurring in a rathole. To verify the validity of the new theory, the current research upon which this paper is based, involves an experimental study of rathole formation in laboratory scale model funnel-flow bins and gravity reclaim stockpiles. A two-dimensional laser line scanner is used to depict rathole profiles, while load cells and pressure sensors are applied to determine instantaneous loads and pressure conditions during filling, storage and discharge. Iron ore fines are used as the test material, with the test program including flat-bottom bins with different diameters as well as varying filling levels and outlet diameters and stockpiles with variable heights and outlet diameters. The tests demonstrate the capability of laser scanning to describe rathole profiles. In addition, the suitability of the load cells and pressure sensors to describe the relevant funnel-flow parameters is shown...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to improve}} {{knowledge}} of long-term inflow and streamflow forecasts. A special {{focus is on}} {{the development of a new}} long-term forecast model and on the evaluation of long-term inflow forecasts. In the first part of the work, a new categorical long-term forecast model is developed and its performance is investigated in four case studies. The forecasts are based only on the current hydrological state of the basin and thus, weather forecasts are not utilised. By using the k-Nearest Neighbour Rule (k-NRR) or the minimum distance classifier (MDC), the forthcoming period is classified into a wetness class based on the hydrological state of the basin on the forecast date. Inflow forecast is finally based on this classification. The results show that for a lake with a large basin (Lake Päijänne case study), this forecast model could be used in real-time inflow forecasting and the results are comparable with the forecast accuracy of the multiple linear regression models. For small basins (< 10 km²) and in Lake Pyhäjärvi, the use of the new model for long-term discharge forecasting gave satisfactory results on April 1. On October 1, long-term forecasting turned out to be difficult irrespective of the forecast model. In the second part of the work, long-term inflow forecasts are evaluated based on their length and accuracy. The study is based on two cases: a single multipurpose reservoir Lake Pyhäjärvi in Säkylä and a multipurpose lake-river system, River Kymijoki. The evaluation method is based on artificially generated inflow forecasts and on the optimisation of the release sequences based on these forecasts. The results are in line with the outcome of similar international studies: if the <b>live</b> <b>capacity</b> of the lake-river system compared with the annual inflow is small, short and accurate forecasts should be aimed at. For large systems, a long forecast period should be used without focusing as much on forecast accuracy. The main finding, however, is related to approximation of the potential hydropower production increase in Finland by supposing that forecast accuracy could be improved and the optimal forecast periods used. In the two case studies it was possible to increase hydropower production up to 0. 7 - 9 % compared with the status quo during the study period, if perfect inflow forecasts had been available. However, the realistic possibilities to increase hydropower production in Finland by improving forecast accuracy were approximated to be 0. 5 - 2 % at the maximum. At the same time problems related to floods and droughts would decrease. Simulated annealing is used as the optimisation algorithm in the operation of the systems, and the evaluation of the performance of this algorithm was one of the special objectives of this study. The algorithm was flexible and reliable...|$|E
