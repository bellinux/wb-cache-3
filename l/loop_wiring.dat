50|$|In most areas, one carrier held a {{monopoly}} on local service. The landline telephone system was originally constructed in an era before transistorisation, remote concentrators or cabinetisation. Individual lines from subscribers ran not to a remote concentrator but directly to the nearest village community dial office, to be terminated at an automated mechanical switch or manual exchange. To keep subscriber <b>loop</b> <b>wiring</b> requirements manageable, local exchanges were built in each tiny hamlet. Rural subscribers often made do with party line service. Each village was a separate rate center for long-distance calls and each had its own block of ten thousand numbers (the largest that reasonably could fit on a small-town manual cord switchboard with a jack and indicator for each line). In most small villages, many of these numbers would remain unused. In large cities, multiple exchanges were created to cover individual districts or neighbourhoods; each had its own series of distinctive prefixes, and multiple blocks of ten thousand numbers each. The first few digits of a number uniquely identified a village, a town or a neighbourhood of a big city.|$|E

The principle and a equivalent circuit are presented in a first time. Then, {{in order to show}} the influence of the helix geometric parameters on the plasma frequency, simulations of <b>loop</b> <b>wire</b> medium based on the method of moments (MoM) are carried out. Comparisons with the classical wire medium show a decrease of the plasma frequency. In a second step, simulations of the <b>loop</b> <b>wire</b> medium, combined with a negative permeability structure are carried out, to show their influence on the negative index of refraction: extraction of the negative index of refraction shows a decrease of this one, in the presence of medium with high inductance.

40|$|Due to {{increase}} {{in the use of}} mobile phones especially on G. S. M networks today, which according to NCC’s report presently in Nigeria have over 138 Million subscribers, coupled with inadequate and sporadic electricity supply, hence for constant operation, a power solution more robust than power bank (which still requires initial charging with electricity or generator) for private and commercial use has been developed with solar as its primary source of energy. This paper focuses on the design, construction and operational advantages of portable solar powered phone charging box (PCB), for mobile phone users as an alternative to what is used today in a reformed and modernized form at school campuses, bus stops, motor parks, shopping complexes, markets, office complexes, airports, social gatherings to mention a few, where pockets of phone charging points with conventional <b>loop</b> <b>wiring</b> of about 10 - 25, 13 A sockets supported with 900 W/ 1. 2 KVA generator is used to charge people mobile phones say at a minimum rate of fifty Naira per phone.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} has {{a clinical}} part, which reveals the author's personal experience of traumatology, and an investigation {{part about the}} reparation of facial fractures. The chosen animal for the experiment was the dog, as it is carnivorous and bigger than the animals usually used (mouse and rabbit). The kind of fracture we made corresponds {{in a certain way}} to an immobilized fracture, which seemed to us to be interesting, as it corresponds to the usual clinical situation after the treatment (reduction and immobilization). although in many previous works the contrary is stated, we think that in a perfect and correctly immobilized fracture the forming of an internal callus is due mainly to the increase of osteogenic cells and capillary vessels from Haversian Canals of fractured bone ends, which is evident in the 2 nd week, with forming of bone trabeculae and the beginning of conversion of caucellous bone in compact bone. as far as the treatment is concerned we describe several orthopedic and surgical techniques, considering the difficulty or facility to use them, available solutions and achieved results. We present 173 fractures treated by us; 100 of the mandible, 43 of the middle third of the facial skeleton, 15 of combined fractures and 15 alveolar fractures. In the various tables we give the percentage of the different kinds of fractures and the kind of immobilization used, through them we can conclude with wires, or arch bar (Erich type) or continuous <b>loop</b> <b>wiring</b> was the treatment used in most cases.

40|$|Recently, {{the phantom}} {{monopole}} configuration was successfully simulated using <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> antennas. The <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> antennas have an undesirable input impedance, making them difficult to match and implement. A {{new type of}} antenna that has a more desirable impedance while still maintaining the same near magnetic field and far field radiation pattern is investigated in this work. The research done focuses on a horizontally placed helical antenna. There is little research done on a horizontally placed helical antenna so several different parameters of this antenna were investigated. A normal mode helical antenna was chosen because of its size and impedance. A helical antenna is an electrically small antenna, like the <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> antenna, with an improved impedance compared to the <b>wire</b> <b>loop.</b> The work done included computer simulation and physical construction of the helical antenna. The physical testing was done {{in order to support}} and verify the computer modeling of the phantom monopole.

40|$|Inductance loops play a {{major role}} in vehicle {{detection}} systems that provide data for use in traffic-actuated signal control and other surveillance systems. Considering the wide variety of vehicles on the road today, it has become increasingly important to find a loop configuration that can accurately detect oddsized vehicles. Odd-sized vehicles include motorcycles, mopeds, bicycles, and high-profile trucks. This loop type should also be easy to install and maintenance-free. Surface loops are typically used, and many loop configurations have been developed for detecting different vehicle types. More recently, deep-buried loops have been developed. Deep-buried loops are located below the pavement surface. They remain undamaged by pavement movements, traffic flow, and construction equipment. The detection ability of these loops, however, is questionable for many vehicle types. Modern practice for wire in a slot, wire in a protective jacket, and wire in a PVC conduit requires complete encapsulation of the <b>loop</b> <b>wire.</b> Many professionals believe that water around a <b>loop</b> <b>wire</b> has an adverse effect on a loop’s detection accuracy.

50|$|The {{magnetic}} pressure force is readily observed in an unsupported <b>loop</b> of <b>wire.</b> If an electric current {{passes through the}} <b>loop,</b> the <b>wire</b> serves as an electromagnet, such that the magnetic field strength inside the loop {{is much greater than}} the field strength just outside the loop. This gradient in field strength gives rise to a {{magnetic pressure}} force that tends to stretch the wire uniformly outward. If enough current travels through the <b>wire,</b> the <b>loop</b> of <b>wire</b> will form a circle. At even higher currents, the magnetic pressure can create tensile stress that exceeds the tensile strength of the wire, causing it to fracture, or even explosively fragment. Thus, management of magnetic pressure is a significant challenge in the design of ultrastrong electromagnets.|$|R

40|$|Low <b>looping</b> in bonding <b>wire</b> is {{become more}} {{challenges}} in the current technology application of advanced packages. In an advanced application, the wire bond process is demanded 100 µm low loop height for three dimensional stacked die packages. The purpose of applying the low <b>loop</b> <b>wire</b> bonding is to form the minimum overall package size. The growth of stacked die packages and its requirement for a low profile gives so many challenges the wire bonding process.

It determines the factors {{that should be considered}} in the forming of the low looping using soft gold wire. The lowest achievable loop heights are physically constrained by the dimensions and plastics deformation behavior of the wire.
