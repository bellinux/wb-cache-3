500|$|Classified {{within the}} arthropods, isopods have a chitinous {{exoskeleton}} and jointed limbs. Isopods are typically flattened dorsoventrally (broader {{than they are}} deep), although many species deviate from this rule, particularly parasitic forms, and those living in the deep sea or in ground water habitats. Their colour may vary, from grey to white, {{or in some cases}} red, green, or brown. Isopods vary in size, ranging from some Microcerberidae species of just 0.3mm to the deep sea Bathynomus spp. of nearly [...] Isopods lack an obvious carapace (shell), which is reduced to a [...] "cephalic shield" [...] covering only the head. This means that the gill-like structures, which in other related groups are protected by the carapace, are instead found on specialised limbs on the abdomen. The dorsal (upper) surface of the animal is covered by a series of overlapping, articulated plates which give protection while also providing flexibility. The isopod body plan consists of a head (cephalon), a thorax (pereon) with eight segments (pereonites), and an abdomen (pleon) with six segments (pleonites), some of which may be fused. The head is fused with the first segment of the thorax to form the cephalon. There are two pairs of unbranched antennae, the first pair being vestigial in land-dwelling species. The eyes are compound and unstalked and the mouthparts include a pair of maxillipeds and a pair of mandibles (jaws) with palps (segmented appendages with sensory functions) and <b>lacinia</b> mobilis (spine-like movable appendages).|$|E

And of the {{families}} given, he is to note for the common simple characteristic, that they are quatrefoils referred to {{a more or less}} elevated position on a central stem, and having, in that relation, the lowermost petal diminished, contrary to the almost universal habit of other flowers to develope in such a position the lower petal chiefly, that it may have its full share of light. You will find nothing but blunder and embarrassment result from any endeavour to enter into further particulars, such as [...] "the relation of the dissepiment with respect to the valves of the capsule," [...] etc., etc., since [...] "in the various species of Veronica almost every kind of dehiscence may be observed" [...] (C. under V. perfoliata, 1936, an Australian species). Sibthorpe gives the entire definition of Veronica with only one epithet added to mine, [...] "Corolla quadrifida, rotata, <b>laciniâ</b> infimâ angustiore," [...] but I do not know what 'rotata' here means, as there is no appearance of revolved action in the petals, so far as I can see.|$|E

50|$|This {{segmentation}} has its extreme in {{the distinctive}} leaf form characteristic of those Adenanthos species known as woollybushes, {{in which the}} leaf is segmented, sometimes many times, into long thin <b>laciniae,</b> round in cross-section (terete), and often covered in a fine down of soft hairs. The number of <b>laciniae</b> varies greatly. In A. pungens, for example, the leaves may be entire, or {{there may be a}} single segmentation into two or three laciniae; in A. sericeus, the leaf is repeatedly tri-segmented into as many as 50 <b>laciniae.</b> This leaf form is seen in around half of the species.|$|R
