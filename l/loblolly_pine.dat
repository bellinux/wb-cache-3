5|$|In nature, Suillus spraguei forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with five-needled pine species. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around {{the roots of}} the trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. S.spraguei produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and rhizomorphs that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath. The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with white pine, a grouping of trees classified in subgenus Strobus of the genus Pinus. However, under controlled pure culture conditions in the laboratory, S.spraguei has also been shown to form associations with Red Pine, Pitch Pine, and <b>Loblolly</b> <b>Pine.</b> Asian populations have been associated with Korean Pine, Chinese White Pine, Siberian Dwarf Pine and Japanese White Pine. In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other boletes, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July–September), although they may be found as late as October. Mushrooms can be parasitized by the fungus Hypomyces completus. In the asexual stage of H.completus, it appears initially as patches of whitish mold {{on the surface of the}} cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce conidia (asexual spores). In the sexual stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes perithecia, asci-containing sexual structures that produce ascospores. The perithecia are pimply and give the surface a roughened texture.|$|E
25|$|The US Forest Service tested chitosan, a biopesticide, to pre-arm {{pine trees}} to defend {{themselves}} against MPB. The US Forest Service results show collodial chitosan elicited a 40% increase in pine resin (P<0.05) in southern pine trees. One milliliter chitosan per 10 gallons water {{was applied to the}} ground area within the drip ring of <b>loblolly</b> <b>pine</b> trees. The application was repeated three times from May through September in 2008. The chitosan was responsible for eliciting natural defense responses of increased resin pitch-outs, with the ability to destroy 37% of the pine beetle eggs.|$|E

25|$|The Upstate region {{contains}} {{the roots of}} an ancient, eroded mountain chain. It is generally hilly, with thin, stony clay soils, and contains few areas suitable for farming. Much of the Piedmont was once farmed. Due to the changing economics of farming, much {{of the land is}} now reforested in <b>Loblolly</b> <b>pine</b> for the lumber industry. These forests are part of the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion. At the southeastern edge of the Piedmont is the fall line, where rivers drop to the coastal plain. The fall line was an important early source of water power. Mills built to harness this resource encouraged the growth of several cities, including the capital, Columbia. The larger rivers are navigable up to the fall line, providing a trade route for mill towns.|$|E

The adelgid has spread very rapidly in southern parts of the range once becoming established, while its expansion northward is much slower. Virtually all the hemlocks in the southern Appalachian Mountains have seen infestations of the insect within the last five to seven years, with thousands of hectares of stands dying within the last two to three years.
