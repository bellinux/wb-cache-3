5|$|Once the {{fortress}} had been captured, Murad placed his own garrison of Janissaries and ordered {{his men to}} repair the walls. Perlati and his soldiers came to Skanderbeg, begging for mercy. Skanderbeg pardoned his soldiers for the surrender and even thanked them for holding out for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b> Skanderbeg continued to shadow the Ottoman army as it headed back home {{in the hopes of}} dealing some serious damage, but his forces were not strong enough to risk provoking them. In October of the same year, Murad managed to inflict a serious a defeat on John Hunyadi's forces in Kosovo. Skanderbeg had planned to join Hunyadi's offensive with 20,000 men, but {{he was not able to}} get there in time due to Đurađ Branković blocking the roads to Kosovo.|$|E
5|$|The Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory of 1898 handed {{additional}} {{parts of}} Hong Kong (the New Territories) to Britain for 99 years, but excluded the Walled City, {{which at the}} time had a population of roughly 700. China was allowed to continue to keep officials there as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not interfere with the defence of British Hong Kong. The following year, the Governor, Sir Henry Blake, suspected that the Viceroy of Canton was using troops to aid resistance to the new arrangements. On 16 May 1899, British forces attacked the Walled City, only to find the Viceroy's soldiers gone, leaving behind only the mandarin and 150 residents. The Qing dynasty ended its rule in 1912, leaving the Walled City to the British.|$|E

5|$|The Wolin {{settlement}} was established {{on the island}} of the same name in the late 8th century. Located {{at the mouth of the}} Oder River, Wolin from the beginning was involved with long distance Baltic Sea trade. The settlement, thought to be identical with both Vineta and Jomsborg, was pagan, multiethnic, and readily kept accepting newcomers, especially craftsmen and other professionals, from all over the world. Being located on a major intercontinental sea route, it soon became a major European industrial and trade power. Writing in the 11th century, Adam of Bremen recognized Wolin as one of the largest European cities, inhabited by honest, good-natured and hospitable Slavic people, together with other nationalities, from Greeks to barbarians, including the Saxons, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not demonstrate their Christianity too openly.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few years}} of the end of World War II, the United States {{deactivated}} all of its remaining battleships and placed them in the United States Navy reserve fleets. Most of these ships were eventually scrapped, but the four Iowa-class battleships were not, and on several occasions {{one or more of these}} four battleships were reactivated for naval gunfire support. The U.S. Navy has held onto the four Iowa-class battleships long after the upkeep and maintenance of operating and maintaining a battleship and the arrival of aircraft and precision guided munitions led other nations to scrap their big-gun fleets. Congress was largely responsible for keeping the four Iowa-class battleships in the United States Navy reserve fleets and on the Naval Vessel Register as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b> The lawmakers argued that the battleships' large-caliber guns had a useful destructive power that is lacking in the smaller, cheaper, and faster guns mounted by U.S. cruisers and destroyers.|$|E

Their films have never left American {{television}} since first appearing in 1958, {{and they continue to}} delight old fans while attracting new admirers.

When Borah staked out progressive positions after his swearing-in, Rhode Island Senator Nelson Aldrich, the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, hoped {{to put pressure on}} him through the Westerner's corporate clients, only to find that he had given up those representations before coming to Washington. Borah became {{one of a growing number}} of progressive Republicans in the Senate. Yet, Borah often opposed liberal legislation, finding fault with it or fearing it would increase the power of the federal government. Throughout his years in the Senate, in which he would serve until his death in 1940, his idiosyncratic positions would limit his effectiveness as a reformer.|$|E
500|$|The Daily Stormer orchestrates what {{it calls}} a [...] "Troll Army", {{involved}} in Internet trolling. It came to attention in October 2014 in a campaign against British Labour politician Luciana Berger, a Jewish Member of Parliament. A member of neo-Nazi group National Action {{had been sent to}} prison for sending her abusive messages over Twitter and The Daily Stormer encouraged its readers to send her antisemitic messages, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not promote violence. It also gave out guidelines on how to limit traceability and create anonymous e-mail and Twitter accounts. Berger said she received 400 abusive messages in one week. The abuse was brought up in the British Parliament, where Speaker John Bercow deemed it [...] "beneath contempt". The Troll Army launched a campaign in February 2015 against Mariam Veiszadeh, an Afghan Australian Muslim activist who demanded that a T-shirt bearing the Australian flag reading [...] "If you don't love it, leave" [...] be withdrawn from sale at Woolworths. [...] A woman was arrested for sending her abusive messages, and Anglin interpreted Veiszadeh's actions as curbing freedom of speech, which he believed [...] "should be responded to with the most ridiculous conceivable hateful speech".|$|E
500|$|The Sabres {{immediately}} {{protested the}} goal, as NHL {{rules of the}} time stated that a player could not score a goal if any {{part of his body}} was within the goal crease. Replays showed that Hull's skate was within the crease when he scored; however, the NHL ruled that he had possession of the puck prior to entering the crease, making the goal legal. [...] League officials stated that that very scenario was addressed in a memo sent to the league's on-ice officials {{prior to the start of}} the playoffs. Hull himself states the goal was legal, supporting the claim that the NHL had altered the rules in a private memo sent to all teams but not released to the public. Media, fans and players across the league remain divided on the goal, some claiming that the league altered the rule after the fact. It remains especially controversial in Buffalo, where fans and former players continue to maintain that the play should have been ruled [...] "no goal". The NHL formally abolished the crease rule prior to the next season, allowing players to score from within the crease freely as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not interfere with the goaltender.|$|E
