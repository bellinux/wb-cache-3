5|$|The jailer said that, after {{struggling}} for two hours, he escaped {{and raised the}} alarm at Moon's restaurant {{across the road from}} the jail. Sheriff Dunnegan sent out a search party to no avail. According to the Ledger, a fence post suspended on two chairs across a window was found in the jury room just after the lynching, near the cell where Laura had been held. It was thought that the men had intended to hang Laura out of the window, but were deterred by an electric <b>light</b> <b>burning</b> nearby.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British forces {{landed on}} the island and told the keeper's wife, Thankful Stone, that they had nothing to fear as long as they kept the <b>light</b> <b>burning.</b> Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the light out per order of the New London customs inspector. The British {{threatened}} to blow up the lighthouse, and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The light's new characteristic was a fixed light with a flash every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When the lighthouse was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. The lighthouse currently uses a VRB-25 lens. The lighthouse switched to solar power in 1988. The light's characteristic is a flash of white light every ten seconds. It continues to operate as a navigational aid to the nearby Intracoastal Waterway.|$|E
25|$|On December 26, 1923, {{the image}} was solemnly {{translated}} from the Church of Santo Domingo to the new sanctuary.

60|$|We {{went into}} a Jewish synagogue,--the {{interior}} cased in marbles, and surrounded with galleries, resting upon arches above arches. There were <b>lights</b> <b>burning</b> at the altar, and it looked very like a Christian church; but it was dirty, and had an odor not of sanctity.|$|R
50|$|Shooting {{began in}} December 1958, {{taking place at}} Pagewood Studios and Artransa Studios. There were some {{location}} scenes at Luna Park and Bondi Beach.

The British threatened to blow up the lighthouse and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 2008, the generator house for the light was renovated to be a summer house for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service interns who study the endangered roseate terns. The erosion control project was completed, but Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy greatly reduced the breeding habitat of the terns to just [...]|$|E

In 2016 the museum changed its name to the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the first}} wave of U-boats {{returned}} to port through the early part of February, Dönitz wrote that each commander [...] "had such an abundance of opportunities for attack that he could not by any means utilize them all: there were times when there were up to ten ships in sight, sailing with all <b>lights</b> <b>burning</b> on peacetime courses." ...|$|R
60|$|But at nightfall {{they came}} into the wide mouth of the River Phasis, that flows through {{the land of the}} world's end, and they saw the <b>lights</b> <b>burning</b> in the palace of Æêtes the king.

60|$|Round we swept, {{first one}} way then another, but we made no headway. In an hour's {{time we were}} no nearer land, and in the {{gathering}} twilight the coast line was dim and blurred.

60|$|Knowing her way, {{and hungry}} for her surcease, she darted down the {{familiar}} ways {{until at last}} her feet struck the dull solidity of the rotting pier.

60|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances Hitchin {{would have}} been in bed, and Cuttance knew his habits sufficiently to be aware of this; his surprise, therefore, was great when he found <b>lights</b> <b>burning,</b> and greater still when, peeping through a chink of the window-shutter, he observed two stout fellows seated at the old man's table. Charles Tregarthen he had never seen before, and, as Oliver Trembath sat {{with his back to the}} window, he could not recognise him.|$|R

60|$|The oars had {{not been}} got in, so the boat glided off again, noiselessly, out through the entrance.
