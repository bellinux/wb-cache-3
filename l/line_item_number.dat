40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{identify}} and analyze the causes of negative unliquidated obligations (NULO) in the O&M, MC appropriation, using sample data drawn from Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton, California. NULOs exist when recorded expenditures (liquidations) exceed amounts obligated. As such, NULOs represent out-of-balance conditions that should not have occurred. NULOs {{were found to be}} correlated with unmatched disbursements, specific transaction types (USMC Standard Accounting, Budgeting and Reporting System (SABRS) Document Identifier Codes 'XSI' and 'XRA'), and contracts containing multiple Contract <b>Line</b> <b>Item</b> <b>Numbers.</b> The thesis categorized causes as either fund administrator errors or disbursing errors. Eighty-eight percent of NULOs were attributable to fund administrators failure to record obligations initially, or only partially, and erroneous adjustments to recorded obligations. SABRS' internal controls were found to be only partially effective due to their reliance upon data elements that were incorrectly or incompletely input into SABRS and other accounting procedural weaknesses. NULOs remained uncorrected {{due to a lack of}} management reports detailing NULOs and fund administrators' failure to use existing management exception reports to identify and correct NULOs. NANAU.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Navy Marine Corps Intranet began planning to transition Marine Corps aviation computer assets to the NMCI network in 2004. Despite the preceding years of transferring other Navy and Marine Corps IT assets, NMCI offered no assurances that {{the transfer of}} Marine Corps aviation maintenance computers and systems would transition to NMCI without service interruption. Marine Corps aviation units use the Naval Tactical Combat Support System (NTCSS) every day in garrison and while deployed to document and track maintenance actions; it is the mandatory element necessary to enable Marine Corps aviation units to maintain aircraft operational readiness. The Marine Requirements Oversight Council concluded that a proof of concept would be conducted to ensure NMCI computers would meet the requirements for Marine Corps deploying units. Contract <b>line</b> <b>item</b> <b>number</b> 0004 AC (CLIN 4 AC) {{was selected as the}} most effective and affordable CLIN from the NMCI products. Marine aviation was chosen as the test element since IT connectivity in garrison and while deployed is crucial to maintain aircraft readiness. This thesis followed the Aviation Proof of Concept (APOC) from its requirements phase to final implementation. It started with developmental testing to identify issues in relation to transitioning the Marine Corps aviation NTCSS network into NMCI. The issues discovered during the development test were brought foreword for the APOC's Test Integration Working Group (TIWG) to analyzed and mitigate. The APOC's operational test used actual Marine aviation units to operate NMCI deployable computers in a real-world environment. The thesis concludes with the current APOC status and future research.

40|$|ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : On 1 November 2000, {{a series}} of new <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> {{was added to the}} Medicare Benefits Schedule, which allowed for case {{conferences}} between physicians (including psychiatrists) and other multidisciplinary providers. On 1 November 2002, an additional set of numbers was added, designed especially for use by psychiatrists. This paper reports the findings of an evaluation of these <b>item</b> <b>numbers.</b> RESULTS : The uptake of the <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> in the three years post their introduction was low to moderate at best. Eighty nine psychiatrists rendered 479 case conferences at a cost to the Health Insurance Commission of $ 70, 584. Psychiatrists who have used the <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> are generally positive about them, as are consumers. Psychiatrists who have not used them have generally not done so {{because of a lack of}} knowledge, rather than direct opposition. The use of the <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> is increasing over time, perhaps as psychiatrists become more aware of their existence and of their utility in maximising quality of care. CONCLUSION : The case conferencing <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> have potential, but as yet this potential is not being realised.

40|$|Unbalanced bidding is {{a serious}} problem for the {{construction}} owner because it may increase the cost of construction The most common way to mathematically unbalance a bid is frontloading where a bidder overstates the unit price of <b>line</b> <b>items</b> scheduled to be performed early in the project and understates the unit price of <b>line</b> <b>items</b> performed later. A bidder can also overstate the unit price of a <b>line</b> <b>item</b> whose quantity was somehow underrated by the engineer. If the owner proves that a mathematically unbalanced bid costs more to perform, the bid is said to be materially unbalanced, in which case the owner can reject the bid. A model is presented that formalizes and automates the process of detecting mathematically and materially unbalanced bids by comparing <b>line</b> <b>item</b> prices with the engineer’s estimates and the average prices offered by the bidders. This model allows owners to detect and reject unbalanced bids, and deters bidders from unbalancing their bid. Bids, mathematical models, financial management, construction costs, optimization,...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Objective: Determine the {{adequacy}} of food composition data for sweetened beverages and snack foods, and improve the nutrient database for a previously validated FFQ (the Beverage and Snack Questionnaire,BSQ). Methods: To illustrate the impact of using only USDA Standard Reference- 24 to perform nutrient analyses of the BSQ, we populated two nutritional databases. The first database included only BSQ foods whose nutrient profiles were available from USDA SR- 24. The second database included nutrient profiles obtained from USDA SR- 24 augmented with data from other databases, food manufacturers, and scientific publications. Nutritional analyses of the BSQ were performed separately for each database, and mean estimates for energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrate were compared. We also compared the nutritional databases by selecting a single food to define the nutrient profile of each <b>line</b> <b>item,</b> and subsequently by selecting multiple foods to define <b>line</b> <b>items.</b> Results: Comparing BSQ nutritional analysis using only information from USDA-SR 24 vs. analysis using this information augmented with other sources revealed minor differences (approximately 0 - 1 %) for mean energy and macronutrients in 13 of 19 <b>line</b> <b>items.</b> However, deviations up to 100 % with respect to macronutrient composition were observed for other <b>line</b> <b>items</b> including fruit drinks, flavored waters, and frozen desserts. Nutritional analysis using single vs. multiple foods to define <b>line</b> <b>items</b> was similar, although significant deviations (up to 100 % were observed for various <b>line</b> <b>items</b> such as candies, cookies, and fruits. Significance: If USDA SR- 24 is the sole source of food composition data, the accuracy of nutritional assessments could be compromised, potentially leading to underestimating effects of sweetened beverages and snack foods on nutritional status and energy balance. Understanding how food composition data and <b>line</b> <b>item</b> definitions impact the performance of FFQs may improve the accuracy of dietary assessment tools, and advance understanding {{of the effects of}} foods on nutritional status...|$|R
