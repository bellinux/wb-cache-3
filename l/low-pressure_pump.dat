40|$|Cummins Westport Incorporated (CWI) has {{designed}} {{and developed a}} liquefied natural gas (LNG) vehicle fuel system that includes a reciprocating pump with the cold end submerged in LNG contained in a vacuum-jacketed tank. This system was tested and analyzed under the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced LNG Onboard Storage System (ALOSS) program. The pumped LNG fuel system developed by CWI and tested under the ALOSS program is a high-pressure system designed for application on Class 8 trucks powered by CWI's ISX G engine, which employs high-pressure direct injection (HPDI) technology. A general ALOSS program objective was to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of a pumped LNG fuel system relative to on-vehicle fuel systems that require the LNG to be ''conditioned'' to saturation pressures that exceeds the engine fuel pressure requirements. These advantages include the capability to store more fuel mass in given-size vehicle and station tanks, and simpler lower-cost LNG refueling stations {{that do not require}} conditioning equipment. Pumped LNG vehicle fuel systems are an alternative to conditioned LNG systems for spark-ignition natural gas and port-injection dual-fuel engines (which typically require about 100 psi), and they are required for HPDI engines (which require over 3, 000 psi). The ALOSS program demonstrated the feasibility of a pumped LNG vehicle fuel system and the advantages of this design relative to systems that require conditioning the LNG to a saturation pressure exceeding the engine fuel pressure requirement. LNG tanks mounted on test carts and the CWI engineering truck were repeatedly filled with LNG saturated at 20 to 30 psig. More fuel mass was stored in the vehicle tanks as well as the station tank, and no conditioning equipment was required at the fueling station. The ALOSS program also demonstrated the general viability and specific performance of the CWI pumped LNG fuel system design. The system tested as part of this program is designed to be used on Class 8 trucks with CWI ISX G HPDI engines. Extensive test cart and engineering truck tests of the pump demonstrated good durability and the high-pressure performance needed for HPDI application. The LNG tanks manufactured by Taylor-Wharton passed SAE J 2343 Recommended Practice drop tests and accelerated road-load vibration tests. NER and hold-time tests produced highly consistent results. Additional tests confirmed the design adequacy of the liquid level sensor, vaporizer, ullage volume, and other fuel system components. While the testing work performed under this program focused on a high-pressure pumped LNG fuel system design, the results also validate the feasibility of a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>pumped</b> fuel system. A <b>low-pressure</b> <b>pumped</b> fuel system could incorporate various design refinements including a simpler and lighter-weight pump, which would decrease costs somewhat relative to a high-pressure system...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to present the design and {{development}} of a chemical vapor deposition reactor {{for the growth of}} high quality homoepitaxy silicon carbide films for electronic device applications. The work was performed in the Nanomaterials and Nanomanufacturing Research Center at the University of South Florida from 8 / 2001 - 5 / 2003. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the technique of choice for SiC epitaxial growth. Epitaxial layers are the building blocks for use in various semiconductor device applications. This thesis reports on a SiC epitaxy process where a carrier gas (hydrogen) is saturated with reactive precursors (silane and propane) which are then delivered to a semiconductor substrate resting on a RF induction heated SiC coated graphite susceptor. Growth proceeds via a series of heterogeneous chemical reactions with several steps, including precursor adsorption, surface diffusion and desorbtion of volatile by-products. The design and development of a reactor to make this process controlled and repeatable can be accomplished using theoretical and empirical tools. Fluid flow modeling, reactor sizing, <b>low-pressure</b> <b>pumping</b> and control are engineering concepts that were explored.

40|$|Ion {{chromatography}} {{on short}} permanently coated monolithic columns {{has been investigated}} {{with the aim of}} developing a low-pressure chromatographic method for the separation of inorganic anions. Both lon-chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography were studied as were three modes of detection namely, direct UVVis using a post-column reaction method, indirect UV-Vis and suppressed conductivity detection. Initially, the investigation of different monolithic columns with the later application of these to low-pressure anion-exchange separations was considered. Traditional analytical columns used m chromatographic separations have high backpressures associated with them. The introduction of commercial polymeric and silica based has effectively reduced the backpressure restriction associated with the traditional chromatographic stationary phase. Hence, the use of short monolithic silica based anion exchange columns (25 mm and 10 mm column lengths) for the low-pressure separation of inorganic anions (fluoride, chloride, nitrite, bromide, mtrate and sulphate) was investigated. The instrumental set-up consisted of a basic FIA manifold using simple peristaltic pumps, but incorporated a short low pressure anion exchanger. The use of direct conductivity and indirect UV detection was examined for the determination of these inorganic anions using various concentrations of phthalate and /?-hydroxybenzoate eluents. Suppressed conductivity was also possible within the FIA/IC system by incorporation of a second low-pressure cation exchange column in the acid form after the short monolithic analytical column. This approach significantly reduced the background conductance of the /?-hydroxybenzoate eluent, resulting in improved detection. limits for the above inorganic anions. A two peristaltic pump system was then developed which allowed gradient separations to be carried out with suppressed conductivity detection. The potential significance and advantages of this work in relation to low cost portable ion chromatography was evident. Finally, the development of another low-pressure ion chromatographic system (LPIC) using monolithic columns coated with DDMAU surfactant (N-dodecyl-N, N- (dimethylammomo) undecanoate) was also considered The column coating showed excellent retention time reproducibility, even at elevated temperatures, over an approximate 17, 200 column volumes Using a combination of <b>low-pressure</b> <b>pumps</b> and short 1 cm monolithic columns, it was possible to separate and detect both silicate and phosphate in surface water samples using post-column reaction (PCR) and UV/Vis detection at 840 nm Linear range was established between 1 and lOmg/L phosphate with this PCR method Total backpressures associated with this system were < 100 psi.

ADS can be manually or automatically initiated. When ADS receives an auto-start signal when water reaches the Low-Low-Low Water Level Alarm setpoint. ADS then confirms with the Low Alarm Water Level, verifies at least 1 <b>low-pressure</b> cooling <b>pump</b> is operating, and starts a 105-second timer. When the timer expires, or when the manual ADS initiate buttons are pressed, the system rapidly releases pressure from the RPV in the form of steam through pipes that are piped to below the water level in the suppression pool (the torus/wetwell), which is designed to condense the steam released by ADS or other safety valve activation into water), bringing the reactor vessel below 32 atm (3200 kPa, 465 psi), allowing the low-pressure cooling systems (LPCS/LPCI/LPCF/GDCS) to restore reactor water level. During an ADS blowdown, the steam being removed from the reactor is sufficient to ensure adequate core cooling even if the core is uncovered. The water in the reactor will rapidly flash to steam as reactor pressure drops, carrying away the latent heat of vaporization and providing cooling for the entire reactor. Low pressure ECCS systems will re-flood the core prior to the end of the emergency blowdown, ensuring that the core retains adequate cooling during the entire event.|$|R

40|$|When a gaseous bubble {{in liquid}} is excited by {{acoustic}} waves, it oscillates {{in harmony with}} the wave and generates strong vortical flows around it, so-called cavitational microstreaming. In this thesis, the microstreaming phenomenon is investigated in development of two microfluidic devices: micropump and microparticle separator. In the micropump, the key idea is to vertically place a capillary tube above the oscillating bubble to collect the upward microstreaming flow into the tube. When the bubble is excited at its resonance frequency, it oscillates with surface undulations (surface wave mode) and pumps water through the tube. The performance of micro pumping is experimentally studied in various conditions in terms of the generated flow rate and pressure. The maximum flow rate and generated pressure are measured at ~ 0. 7 ¥ìl and 1. 8 Pa, indicating that the present pump falls into high-flow-rate and <b>low-pressure</b> type <b>pumps.</b> The present pump runs without physical connections or electric wiring to bubbles, implicating potential applications of implantable micropumps. The microparticle separator utilizes the recently-discovered phenomenon that the oscillating bubble attracts and captures large neighboring objects, not small objects (< 20 ¥ìm). This capturing principle is evaluated in three different microfluidic configurations: mini- and micro-channels and microchamber. Single or multiple microbubbles are deposited on Teflon-patterned spots or microcavities in the channel and oscillated by an acoustic wave. When a mixture solution with 80 - and 2 -¥ìm particles is injected into the channels, only the 80 -¥ìm particles are captured near the oscillating bubbles while the 2 -¥ìm particles pass the bubbles without being captured. By simply turning off the acoustic wave, the captured 80 -¥ìm particles are easily released. A similar capturing (separating) operation is achieved in the microchamber. Since the filled water in the microchamber is quiescent, oscillating bubbles need to move in the chamber to selectively capture 80 -¥ìm particles suspended in the chamber. 2 -D movements of oscillating bubbles are achieved by sequentially activating arrayed square electrodes on the chamber bottom surface, so-called electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD). When the bubble is simultaneously actuated by EWOD and acoustic excitation, it captures and carries 80 -¥ìm particles, not 2 -¥ìm particles...|$|R
40|$|Characterized by super-synchronous {{rotation}} of cavities around {{the periphery of}} rocket engine turbopump inducers, rotating cavitation is the primary cavitation instability considered in this thesis. A recently developed hypothesis for rotating cavitation onset is assessed through novel experimental analysis and a previously developed body force modeling approach using the MIT inducer, representative of {{the design of the}} Space Shuttle main engine <b>low-pressure</b> oxidizer <b>pump</b> inducer. A previously developed temporal and spatial Fourier decomposition, known as Traveling Wave Energy (TWE) analysis, of experimental unsteady inlet pressure measurements of the cavitating MIT inducer is demonstrated. TWE analysis offers several advantages over the current experimental analysis methods, resolving frequency, spatial mode shapes, and rotation direction of cavitation phenomena. Cut-on/cut-off behavior between rotating cavitation and alternate blade cavitation is observed, supporting the hypothesis that alternate blade cavitation is a necessary precursor to rotating cavitation onset. TWE is adapted for use on high speed borescope video data taken in the same experimental campaign. The frequency content extracted is qualitatively correlated with the results from the pressure data, establishing TWE as a viable tool for quantitative analysis of optical data. The video TWE results indicate that cavitation instability signatures are uniform in the radial direction, suggesting that a pressure transducer array can be established as the primary detection method for rotating cavitation and thereby simplifying test setups. A body force based modeling approach typically used for aero-engine compressor stability prediction is assessed for use in predicting rotating cavitation. A previously developed inducer-specific body force model formulation is validated in a representative compressor geometry, capturing global performance across the characteristic within 7 %. However, the model exhibits convergence issues when applied to the inducer, hypothesized to be due to sensitivity in the inducer's loss characteristics. The investigation suggests the low flow coefficient design of the inducer drives the loss sensitivity and is the root cause behind the model's convergence issues. The results indicate the body force model is valid for the higher flow coefficient designs and lower stagger angles typically found in aero-engine compressors and fans. Suggestions for desensitizing the model for the inducer as well as further diagnostics defining the limiting geometry case for body force modeling are made. by Vincent Wang. Thesis: S.

40|$|This work aims to {{characterize}} the dynamic behavior of a four bladed inducer and clarify the physical mechanism {{that leads to the}} onset of rotating cavitation. The inducer under consideration is representative of a <b>low-pressure</b> liquid oxygen <b>pump</b> (LPOP) inducer of modern design and incorporates several standard design features used in rocket turbopumps to suppress rotating cavitation. The mechanism is characterized based on a combination of two-phase numerical simulations and inducer experiments. Experimental measurements demonstrate a supersynchronous rotating cavity in the periphery of the inducer inlet at frequencies between 1. 2 and 1. 6 times rotor frequency and a synchronous 2 nd spatial harmonic pattern associated with alternate blade cavitation. The analysis indicates a causal link between alternate blade cavitation and rotating cavitation, with a distinct cut-on cut-off behavior. Numerical calculations and high-speed videos elucidate the mechanism of breakdown of alternate blade cavitation and the formation of rotating cavitation. The present work suggests that rotating cavitation is caused by the coupling of the cavities on adjacent blades during alternate blade cavitation. Due to the nearly tangential flow, the vortex lines from one of the non-cavitating blades wrap around the blade leading edge of the adjacent blade, which yields a drop in static pressure and cavity formation. The tip vortex cavity interaction with {{the leading edge of the}} blade leads to sheet cavity breakdown with periodic growth and collapse of cavities, creating the apparent super-synchronous rotation of the cavitating region.
