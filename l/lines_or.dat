5|$|Bus {{services}} are provided to numerous stations. Most bus services provide feeding to the metro system where possible, {{and then do}} not continue into town. However, since the metro operates solely into town, instead of across it, many buses operate between stations on different <b>lines,</b> <b>or</b> provide alternative routes across town.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts may feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall <b>lines</b> <b>or</b> dry lines. Warm fronts are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. The weather usually clears quickly after a front's passage. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness, {{although there is}} invariably a wind shift.|$|E
5|$|Because R. norvegicus {{and related}} species {{are seen as}} pests, their {{intentional}} import into foreign countries is often regulated. For example, the importation of foreign rodents is prohibited in Australia, and so various coat types, colors, and varieties have been bred separately from foreign <b>lines,</b> <b>or</b> are just not obtainable within that country (for example, hairless and dumbo-eared fancy rats do not exist in Australia). In other areas, like the Canadian province of Alberta, which is considered rat-free, the ownership of domestic fancy rats outside of schools, laboratories, and zoos is illegal.|$|E

5|$|Data {{collected}} by land locations coding in METAR are conveyed worldwide via phone <b>lines</b> <b>or</b> wireless technology. Within many nations' meteorological organizations, this data is then plotted onto a weather map using the station model. A station {{model is a}} symbolic illustration showing the weather occurring at a given reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to plot a number of weather elements in a small space on weather maps. Maps filled with dense station-model plots {{can be difficult to}} read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} advent of printing, the visual {{appearance}} of poetry often added meaning or depth. Acrostic poems conveyed meanings in the initial letters of <b>lines</b> <b>or</b> in letters at other specific places in a poem. In Arabic, Hebrew and Chinese poetry, the visual presentation of finely calligraphed poems has played an important part in the overall effect of many poems.|$|E
5|$|Fischer heavily disparaged chess {{as it was}} {{currently}} being played (at the highest levels). As a result, on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fischer announced and advocated a variant of chess called Fischerandom Chess (later known as Chess960). The goal of Fischerandom Chess was {{to ensure that a}} game between two players is a contest between their understandings of chess, rather than their abilities to memorize opening <b>lines</b> <b>or</b> prepare opening strategies.|$|E

5|$|Food webs exhibit {{principles}} of ecological emergence through {{the nature of}} trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., primary predators). Theoretical and empirical studies identify non-random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time. Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability. Step by step <b>lines</b> <b>or</b> relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated.|$|E
5|$|McCracken, {{who came}} to Hollywood after winning acclaim in the 1943 {{production}} of Oklahoma!, was deeply discouraged by her experiences filming the Hollywood Canteen number and did not like working with Prinz. As a choreographer he {{made no effort to}} integrate his dances into specific story <b>lines,</b> <b>or</b> to choreograph specific dance steps. This resulted deep disillusionment for McCracken, whose Oklahoma! dances were choreographed by Agnes de Mille, since Prinz was not able to support or advance McCracken's artistic development. However, he gave her latitude to incorporate ballet in her dance routine, and Prinz did not object to her ideas.|$|E
5|$|Passenger trains connect from Suvalki, Hrodno and Lithuania to Warsaw and {{the rest}} of the European {{passenger}} network. Passenger services are provided by two rail service providers, PKP Intercity that provides intercity passengers trains (express, intercity, eurocity, hotel and TLK) and Przewozy Regionalne that operates only regional passenger trains financed by the voivodeship. Passenger trains are mostly run using electrical multiple units (on electrified <b>lines)</b> <b>or</b> rail buses.|$|E

5|$|Rhyme {{consists}} of identical ("hard-rhyme") or similar ("soft-rhyme") sounds {{placed at the}} ends of <b>lines</b> <b>or</b> at predictable locations within lines ("internal rhyme"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme. The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises are {{threatened}} by deforestation and the wildlife trade, which includes the exotic pet trade, traditional medicine, and bushmeat. Other threats includes road construction, selective logging, and slash and burn agriculture. Habitat fragmentation obstructs biological dispersal for these species that rely on vines and lianas to move from tree to tree. Consequently, slow lorises are found dead on power <b>lines</b> <b>or</b> are victims of roadkill in areas where roads cut between forest patches.|$|E
5|$|Squall <b>lines,</b> <b>or</b> solid {{bands of}} strong thunderstorms, can form ahead of cold fronts and lee troughs {{due to the}} {{presence}} of significant atmospheric moisture and strong upper level divergence, leading to hail and high winds. When significant directional wind shear exists in the atmosphere ahead of a cold front {{in the presence of a}} strong upper level jet stream, tornado formation is possible. Although tornadoes can form anywhere on Earth, the greatest number occur in the Great Plains in the United States, because downsloped winds off the north-south oriented Rocky Mountains, which can form a dryline, aid their development at any strength.|$|E

50|$|A siding, in rail terminology, is a {{low-speed}} {{track section}} distinct from a running <b>line</b> <b>or</b> through route {{such as a}} main <b>line</b> <b>or</b> branch <b>line</b> <b>or</b> spur. It may connect to through track or to other sidings at either end. Sidings often have lighter rails, meant for lower speed or less heavy traffic, and few, if any, signals. Sidings connected at both ends to a running line {{are commonly known as}} loops; otherwise they are known as single-ended sidings or dead end sidings, or (if short) stubs.|$|R
5|$|The GO system {{map shows}} seven train <b>lines</b> (<b>or</b> corridors), all departing from Toronto's Union Station and mostly named {{respectively}} after the outer terminus of train service. Although colours are assigned in a consistent fashion to each line in all official media, in colloquial parlance lines are only ever {{referred to by}} their names. Buses are numbered in blocks of 10, corresponding to the nearest train line, with the 40s and 50s reserved for express services along the 407 ETR corridor which {{does not have a}} corresponding train line.|$|E
5|$|The London Underground is {{a public}} rapid transit system in the United Kingdom that serves {{a large part of}} Greater London and the home {{counties}} of Essex, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. It has many former stations, while others were planned but not opened. Some stations were closed because of low passenger usage rendering them uneconomical; some became redundant after lines were re-routed or replacements were constructed; and others are no longer served by the Underground but remain open to National Rail main line services. Many stations were planned as parts of new <b>lines</b> <b>or</b> extensions to existing ones but were later abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The {{cell lines}} of origin {{are not fully}} understood. The {{mechanism}} may involve abnormal activation of stem cells. In the proximal airways, stem cells that express keratin 5 {{are more likely to}} be affected, typically leading to squamous-cell lung carcinoma. In the middle airways, implicated stem cells include club cells and neuroepithelial cells that express club cell secretory protein. Small-cell lung carcinoma may be derived from these cell <b>lines</b> <b>or</b> neuroendocrine cells, and may express CD44.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two issues}} {{regarding}} tooth shape. One is the cross-sectional {{profile of the}} individual tooth. The other is the <b>line</b> <b>or</b> curve on which the tooth is set {{on the face of}} the gear: in other words the <b>line</b> <b>or</b> curve along which the cross-sectional profile is projected to form the actual three-dimensional shape of the tooth. The primary effect of both the cross-sectional profile and the tooth <b>line</b> <b>or</b> curve is on the smoothness of operation of the gears. Some result in a smoother gear action than others.|$|R

5|$|American kestrels feed {{largely on}} small {{animals such as}} grasshoppers, dragonflies, lizards, mice, voles, and small birds. The kestrel has also been {{reported}} to have killed snakes, bats, and squirrels. The kestrel is able to maintain high population densities, {{at least in part}} because of the broad scope of its diet. The American kestrel's primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power <b>lines,</b> <b>or</b> fence posts. It also hunts by kiting, hovering in the air with rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century as {{telephone}} lines became available, it became popular to add telegraph onto telephone lines with an earth return phantom circuit. An LC filter was required to prevent telegraph clicks being heard on the telephone line. From the 1920s onwards, telephone <b>lines,</b> <b>or</b> balanced lines dedicated to the purpose, were used for FDM telegraph at audio frequencies. The first of these systems in the UK was a Siemens and Halske installation between London and Manchester. GEC and AT also had FDM systems. Separate pairs were used for the send and receive signals. The Siemens and GEC systems had six channels of telegraph in each direction, the AT system had twelve. All of these systems used electronic oscillators to generate a different carrier for each telegraph signal and required a bank of band-pass filters to separate out the multiplexed signal at the receiving end.|$|E
