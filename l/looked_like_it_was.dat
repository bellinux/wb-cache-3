5|$|Celtic faced Yugoslavia (now Serbian) side Vojvodina Novi Sad in the quarter-finals, {{and lost}} {{the first leg}} 1–0 after a goal from Milan Stanić; this was Celtic's only defeat of the competition. The tie <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to end in a draw after Chalmers had given Celtic a 1–0 lead in the second leg. This would have {{resulted}} in the teams from having to go to Rotterdam for a replay. However, in the 90th minute captain Billy McNeill scored to give Celtic the victory. In the semi-finals, Czechoslovakian side Dukla Prague were beaten 3–1 in Glasgow, Johnstone put the hosts in front, before Stanislav Štrunc equalised. A second half brace from Willie Wallace gave Celtic the victory. The teams then drew 0–0 in Prague, which meant Celtic progressed to the final.|$|E

That is not explicit in the article, but Derosier is known as an evolution proponent, so Behe should have known, since he quotes Derosier seemingly as in agreement, that Derosier disagreed with him regarding whether the bacterial flagellum points to evolution or Intelligent Design.|$|E

However, Trevor Penney made 42 - including just the one four - in a 77-run partnership with Loudon, and Dougie Brown made an unbeaten 16 at the end to lead Warwickshire home with five balls to spare.|$|E

With the two Complete Works Of editions released by the Wolfe's and Sytin's publishing houses, academic Nestor Kotlyarevsky nominated the author for the Nobel Prize for literature. Then World War I broke out. Merezhkovskys expressed their skepticism as to the Russian involvement in it and the patriotic hullabaloo stirred up by some intellectuals. The writer made a conscious effort to distance himself from politics and succeeded almost, but in 1915 was in it again, becoming friends with Alexander Kerensky and joining the Maxim Gorky-led Movement of the patriotic left calling for Russia's withdrawal from the War in the painless possible way.|$|E

Love wore a satin and lace dress {{once owned by}} actress Frances Farmer, and Cobain wore plaid pajamas. Six months later, on August 18, the couple's only child, a daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, was born. In April 1994, Cobain died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in their Seattle home while Love was in rehab in Los Angeles. During their marriage, and after Cobain's death, Love became {{something}} of a hate-figure among some of Cobain's fans. In reflecting on their relationship, Love said: [...] "I think that it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> headed for doom, but it didn't feel like it was headed for doom on a daily basis. We went mountain biking; we would go camping. We were damn normal." [...] After his cremation, Love divided portions of Cobain's ashes; she kept some in a teddy bear and some in an urn. Another portion of his ashes was taken by Love to the Namgyal Buddhist Monastery in Ithaca, New York in 1994, where they were ceremonially blessed by Buddhist monks and mixed into clay which was made into memorial sculptures.|$|E

Radar guns, which {{were used for}} many years in professional baseball, did not exist when Dalkowski was playing, so the only evidence supporting this level of velocity is anecdotal. It is certain that with his high speed and penchant for throwing wild pitches, he would have been an intimidating opponent for any batter who faced him. Andy Etchebarren, a catcher for Dalkowski at Elmira, described his fastball as [...] "light" [...] and fairly easy to catch. According to Etchebarren his wilder pitches usually went high, sometimes low; [...] "Dalkowski would throw a fastball that <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> coming in at knee level, only to see it sail past the batter's eyes".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the design {{approach}} had evolved yet again. One {{problem with the}} [...] "second generation" [...] design approach described above was that the plotting of causal links amongst twenty or so medium-term strategic goals was still a relatively abstract activity. In practice it ignored the fact that opportunities to intervene, to influence strategic goals are, and need to be, anchored in current and real management activity. Secondly, the need to [...] "roll forward" [...] and test {{the impact of these}} goals necessitated the creation of an additional design instrument: the Vision or Destination Statement. This device was a statement of what [...] "strategic success", or the [...] "strategic end-state", <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> quickly realized that if a Destination Statement was created {{at the beginning of the}} design process, then it was easier to select strategic activity and outcome objectives to respond to it. Measures and targets could then be selected to track the achievement of these objectives. Design methods that incorporate a Destination Statement or equivalent (e.g. the results-based management method proposed by the UN in 2002) represent a tangibly different design approach to those that went before, and have been proposed as representing a [...] "third generation" [...] design method for balanced scorecards.|$|E

At that point Googlagong {{would find a way}} to hold serve, and in the next game broke Evert's serve off a smash by Evert with a backhand winner to get to 32 in the second set. After that, Googlagong started bring Evert into net passing her with cross court shots to win the second set. In the third set, Evert and Googlagong had two tense games at 3-all in the third and pivotal set, which both held serve and leveled at 4-all, but from that point onwards Evert only won one point in the next two games and lost the spot in the finals.

2500|$|Since Paul's Boutique {{was first}} released, its {{critical}} standing improved significantly. NME found the album to [...] "still [...] an electrifying blast of cool" [...] in a 1994 review, viewing it as a [...] "younger incarnation" [...] of Ill Communication. Mojo {{asserted that the}} album [...] "shredded the rulebook" [...] and called it [...] "one of the most inventive rap albums ever made".

2500|$|The {{promises}} {{offered by}} {{one person to}} another are the terms of a contract, but not every representation before an acceptance will always count as a term. The basic rule of construction is that a representation is a term if it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "intended" [...] to be from the viewpoint of a reasonable person. It matters how much importance is attached to the term by the parties themselves, but also as a way to protect parties of lesser means, the courts added that someone who is in a more knowledgeable position {{will be more likely to}} be taken to have made a promise, rather than a mere representation. In Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams Mr Williams sold a Morris car to a second hand dealer and wrongly (but in good faith, relying on a forged log-book) said it was a 1948 model when it was really from 1937. The Court of Appeal held that the car dealer could not later claim breach of contract because they were in a better position to know the model. By contrast, in Dick Bentley Productions Ltd v Harold Smith (Motors) Ltd the Court of Appeal held that when a car dealer sold a Bentley to a customer, mistakenly stating it had done 20,000 miles when the true figure was 100,000 miles, this was intended to become a term because the car dealer was in a better position to know. A misrepresentation may also generate the right to cancel (or [...] "rescind") the contract and claim damages for [...] "reliance" [...] losses (as if the statement had not been made, and so to get one's money back). But if the representation is also a contract term a claimant may also get damages reflecting [...] "expected" [...] profits (as if the contract were performed as promised), though often the two measures coincide.|$|E

2500|$|In 1951, E. W. Kettering wrote a {{paper for}} the ASME entitled, History and Development of the 567 Series General Motors Locomotive Engine, which goes into great {{detail about the}} {{technical}} obstacles that were encountered during {{the development of the}} 567 engine (these same considerations apply to the 645 and 710). The 567's designers started with a tabula rasa,"In time most of the early bugs were cleaned up, but it was becoming more evident that to make a substantial gain in the durability of the 201A engine a major redesign would be in order. The diesel locomotive was rapidly proving itself and to the more optimistic it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{going to be a good}} business, so it was decided that the engine would be redesigned for railroad use only. The design would not be handicapped by requirements for marine, Navy, or stationary application. Most of the Winton experimental design group moved to Detroit where the redesign was to be made. After settling in Detroit we took a large piece of paper and on one side wrote down all of the troubles which were known in the 201A engine at that time. On the other side we were going to write down parts of the engine which had been satisfactory. These items were based on the four years experience in the field and the test work at Winton and General Motors Research. It did not take long to fill in one side of the sheet. In fact, the more we looked into what we could salvage of the 201A design to correct all of these troubles the more apparent it was that we should start with a clean piece of paper and forget the 201A." [...] systematically eliminating each of the 201A's many deficiencies which were preventing the earlier design from becoming successful in freight service, although the 201A was relatively successful in the less-demanding passenger and switching services. The 567 design had nothing in common with the 201A except the two-stroke cycle itself: each and every component of the 201A was replaced with a new design, even the [...] "dipstick", to paraphrase one of Kettering's off-handed comments. The 567 proved to be exceptionally successful in passenger, switching, freight, marine and stationary services, and, counting its two successors, the 645 and 710, which are not materially different from the 567 (all have the same external dimensions, differing mainly in per cylinder displacement), collectively have given nearly 80 years of exceptionally reliable service to those applications. As but one example of the achievements of the tabula rasa design: whereas the Winton 201A was doing very well with a [...] piston lifetime, the 567 immediately achieved a [...] piston lifetime, and in at least one case, reached a [...] piston lifetime, a 10:1 to 20:1 improvement."A brief comparison can be drawn as to life of pistons in passenger service. These comparisons must be based on passenger operation as there never were any 201As in any other service than passenger and switcher. The 201A aluminum piston at the very beginning did not run 50,000 miles and the later 201A pistons ran a questionable 100,000 miles in hard service. The average life of the first 567 piston was in the range of 400,000 to 500,000. On one major railroad the average life of the current design two-piece piston is at least one million miles (Fig. 24)." ...|$|E
