5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} {{because what we}} were doing was in such a <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E
5|$|Although the XB-21 {{failed to}} win a {{production}} contract, {{it was the first}} of a <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> North American Aviation medium bomber aircraft, and provided experience and knowledge that assisted in the development of the North American NA-40, which, developed into the B-25 Mitchell, would become one of the Army's standard medium bombers of World War II.|$|E

The visuals and audio of the game were also considered of poor quality.|$|E

5|$|A <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} {{along the}} front edge of the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} novels {{continued}} the storyline, {{and a video}} game adaptation was also released. Dark Angel is considered to have gothic and female empowerment themes; Max followed a <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> strong female characters in Cameron's work, including Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley, and Dark Angel {{is considered to be}} part of a wave of shows in the late 90s and early 2000s that feature strong female characters, alongside Buffy the Vampire Slayer, , and La Femme Nikita.|$|E

They were forced to separate and hide in Budapest sometime between October 1944, when Nazi Germany occupied Hungary and installed the Arrow Cross in power, and February 1945, when the Soviets defeated the German Army in Budapest.|$|E
5|$|Cibber's poetical {{work was}} derided in his time, {{and has been}} remembered only for being poor. His {{importance}} in British theatre history rests on his {{being one of the}} first in a <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> actor-managers, on the interest of two of his comedies as documents of evolving early 18th-century taste and ideology, and on the value of his autobiography as a historical source.|$|E

5|$|Max Guevara (X5-452) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} and the protagonist of the cyberpunk science fiction television program Dark Angel. During both seasons of the series Max was portrayed by Jessica Alba and by Geneva Locke during childhood flashbacks.

5|$|Stefani {{first came}} {{face to face}} with {{designing}} clothes when she and her mother would sew clothes for themselves when she was young.

When she became successful and began to tour constantly, she felt she lost her way. Then she met the stylist Andrea Lieberman. Lieberman introduced her to ready-to-wear clothing. Later Lieberman became her creative consultant and Zaldy Goco took over as the head designer. Goco later parted ways with L.A.M.B.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} , the route passes by open fields as it overlooks {{the lake to}} the east. The route {{gradually}} descends back into the valley as it heads further northward into the town of Fleming. Once in Fleming, NY38 runs along the lakeshore and serves a <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> lakeside homes as it passes {{by a series of}} fields to the west. The amount of development along the route begins to increase at the northern end of the lake in the hamlet of Melrose Park, where NY38 meets NY437 by way of a traffic circle. At this point, NY437 becomes the primary lakeside highway while NY38 becomes a four-lane divided highway and heads northwest as Lake Avenue toward the city of Auburn.|$|E
