5000|$|The {{weapon was}} chosen {{instead of the}} Greek-designed [...] "Philippidis gun" [...] ('Οπλον Φιλιππίδου), itself based on an earlier model of the same Austrian manufacturer, after intense {{lobbying}} against the Greek design in 1905. This caused a serious political crisis, with accusations about [...] "national treason" [...] heard in the Greek Parliament. The Philippidis gun was officially approved for a 1925 order, but, again, the Mannlicher-Schönauer was produced (by Breda in Italy), due to (reportedly) <b>late</b> <b>submission</b> of the Greek designs to the Italian manufacturer and/or cost factors.|$|E
50|$|Arthur Kirkland (Al Pacino), {{a defense}} {{attorney}} in Baltimore, is in jail on a contempt of court charge after punching Judge Henry T.

McCullagh was stopped for a minor traffic offence, but then mistaken for a killer {{of the same name}} and has already spent {{a year and a half}} in jail; Fleming has repeatedly stymied Kirkland's efforts to have the case reviewed. Though there is strong new evidence that Jeff is innocent, Fleming refuses McCullaugh's appeal due to its <b>late</b> <b>submission</b> and leaves him in prison.

5000|$|During {{the early}} spring of 1791, Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant began working on {{a plan for the}} capital city that {{identified}} the future sites of the [...] "Congress House" [...] (the United States Capitol) and the [...] "President's House" [...] (the White House). Design competitions were then held to solicit designs for each of those structures. Architect James Hoban was selected to design the President's House, while no satisfactory drawings were submitted for the Capitol. A <b>late</b> <b>submission</b> by William Thornton was selected for the Capitol. Stephen Hallet was hired to oversee construction, which got underway in September 1793. Hallet proceeded to make alterations to the design, against the wishes of Washington and Jefferson, and was subsequently dismissed. George Hadfield was hired in October 1795 as superintendent of construction, but resigned three years later in May 1798, due to dissatisfaction with Thornton's plan and quality of work done thus far.|$|E

50|$|The GAA {{itself was}} founded in 1884 and the first Cork County Board was formed in 1886 with 21 teams from across the county. Ballincollig were in this initial 21, however it wasn't until 1887 that the first record of entry into the Championship from a team from Carrigrohane, with a <b>late</b> <b>submission.</b> With a lot of {{upheaval}} {{in the early days}} of the board, there were rival boards formed and in 1891 the club entered a team under the name of Ballincollig Gladstonians. It wasn't until 1895 that the Ballincollig recorded its first significant victory in the Bride Valley Tournament by defeating the Barrs. In 1903 the club as well as the town fell into decline with the closure of the gunpowder mills. 1909 saw a huge revival with the arrival of new Parish Priest Fr Dan O'Donovan and the starting up of the Mid Cork Leagues. 1919 saw the adoption of today's club colours, green and white and it wasn't until 1927 that the club introduced a football team at any level. 1939 saw Ballincollig win the Intermediate Hurling Championship and were then regraded to senior status. In 1942, the club was the first team in nine years to defeat Glen Rovers in the Cork Senior Hurling Championship. In the period from 1941 to 1943, the club came very close to winning the Senior Hurling title. In 1943, a dubious free almost 9 minutes into added time cost the clubvictory over a great St Finbarr's side. After being outclassed in the previous two finals by Glen Rovers and St Finbarr's, Ballincollig had delivered their greatest ever senior display, only to be held to a draw in controversial circumstances. In the replay, they were unable to get over the sense of injustice from the drawn game, and they capitulated easily.|$|E

40|$|Assignments {{can play}} a pivotal role for {{students}} securing higher marks. Each assignment has its due date for submission and missing this date without permission would require a penalty. Significant amounts {{of time and money}} are spent during the process of getting and granting permission, and verifying the approval of late assignment submitter. This study analyses three research questions: (1) Are the students who are seeking permission for <b>late</b> <b>submission</b> really motivated by the objective of securing higher mark?; (2) Does gender type of students play any role for <b>late</b> <b>submission</b> and for securing higher mark?; and (3) Does age group of students play any role for <b>late</b> <b>submission</b> and for securing higher marks? On the basis of an in-depth analysis of assignments and final examination marks of on-campus students for one of the courses at one of the Australian Universities, we concluded the following. Firstly, late assignment submitters were indicator of poor students in terms of performance. Secondly, the gender type did not play any role for ‘on-time ’ and ‘late ’ assignment submissions and mark achievement. Thirdly, the highest percentage (66. 7 %) of late assignment submitters was from the age group 20 - 25. Surprisingly, 100 percent of the dropped-out students among the late-submitters were from this age group. This could be due to several reasons but without further investigation, we could not determine the exact reason. Finally, the age group 20 - 25 was marginally poor in assignment performance but in the final examination they became marginally better than other age groups as the poorest students of that age group had already been dropped-out...|$|E

This reflects the good threshold setting approach used. It must be noted that both the difficulty of the task itself (searching acoustic queries on spontaneous data the type and quality of the acoustic data) and the absence of prior knowledge of the target language produce this low performance. However, this system is worse than the text-based STD system. This, as expected, is due {{to the use of the}} correct phone transcription for each query and hence the knowledge of the target language employed to build the text-based STD system.|$|R
