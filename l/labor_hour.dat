40|$|Many {{economic}} models featuring labor supply decision, {{especially in}} macroeconomic analysis, assume away heterogeneity {{in the nature}} of work, or assume that the nature of work is irrelevant to the labor/leisure choice. This paper studies the macroeconomic implications of relaxing this assumption. Estimation from micro data using <b>labor</b> <b>hours,</b> wages, consumption, and nonpecuniary job characteristics suggests that labor supply responds to differences and to changes {{in the nature of}} work. Ceteris paribus, some job characteristics induce more <b>labor</b> <b>hours</b> than others do. Labeling the jobs that embed the labor-inducing characteristics as better quality jobs, the study estimates a Job Quality index for the aggregate U. S. economy from 1850 to 2000.

40|$|Background: In 2009, {{residents}} of Lhasa city, Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), China reported {{large numbers of}} mosquitoes and bites from these insects. It is unclear whether {{this was a new}} phenomenon, which species were involved, and whether these mosquitoes had established themselves in the local circumstances. Methods: The present study was undertaken in six urban sites of Chengguan district Lhasa city, Tibet. Adult mosquitoes were collected by bed net trap, <b>labor</b> <b>hour</b> method and light trap in August 2009 and August 2012. The trapped adult mosquitoes were initially counted and identified according to morphological criteria, and a proportion of mosquitoes were examined more closely using a multiplex PCR assay. Results: 907 mosquitoes of the Culex pipiens complex were collected in this study. Among them, 595 were females and 312 were males. There {{was no significant difference in}} mosquito density monitored by bed net trap and <b>labor</b> <b>hour</b> method in 2009 and 2012. Of 105 mosquitoes identified by multiplex PCR, 36 were pure mosquitoes (34. 29 %) while 69 were hybrids (65. 71 %). The same subspecies of Culex pipiens complex were observed by bed net trap, <b>labor</b> <b>hour</b> method and light trap in 2009 and 2012. Conclusion: The local Culex pipiens complex comprises the subspecies Cx. pipiens pipiens, Cx. pipiens pallens, Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus and its hybrids. Mosquitoes in the Cx. pipiens complex, known to be, potentially, vectors of periodic filariasis and encephalitis, are now present from one season to the next, and appear to be established in Lhasa City, TAR.

40|$|A milking {{operation}} simulation model was developed using an object-oriented approach. Six object classes were de-fined: things, living things, animals, operator, cow, and parlor. Operator, cow, and parlor classes were the basic {{units of the}} model. Each object in the model is a self-contained unit that represents its real world counterpart. The model operation and events were scheduled by sending messages among the objects. Messages caused operator and cows to move be-tween locations inside the parlor and caused changes in the model status. An algorithm for a discrete event simulation that was message-oriented was used to resolve possible conflicts among objects, thus empowering all objects in the model with decision-making capability. The method {{was designed as a}} teaching and research tool. Proper milking routine can be demonstrated with this model. Also, various milking situations can be created in the model to study effects that would be difficult to evaluate otherwise. The model closely simulated real {{milking operation}}s.

The audit disclosed that over 50 % of the work under six of the cost-reimbursement contracts examined was recurring and could have been estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy making the work suitable for fixed-price contracting. The report made recommendations to the Head of Procurement and the Administrator, EIA. These recommendations were to comply with procurement regulations by identifying recurring tasks that were susceptible to fixed-price contracting, preparing definitive statements of work that would permit fixed-price contracting, and awarding fixed-price contracts. Procurement recognized the benefits of fixed-price contracting and agreed to work closely with the EIA to identify work susceptible to fixed-price contracting. These efforts resulted in the award of two <b>labor</b> <b>hour</b> contracts but no firm-fixed-price contracts. The purpose of this followup audit was to review Procurement and EIA actions to develop definitive work statements for recurring tasks that are suitable for firm-fixed-price contracts.

40|$|Annual data {{on labor}} hours {{incurred}} for maintaining individual trucks {{in a large}} fleet are available from a truck leasing firm. Up to seven consecutive annual reports are available for a single truck, and by allowing cumulative mileage, the primary explanatory variable, {{to serve as a}} measure of time, data for a single truck can be effectively viewed as a sample from a growth curve taken at irregular inspection times. The goal is to predict labor hours for a subsequent year. Under this framework, three methods of analyzing the data are considered;(1) A linear interpolation method: Linear interpolation is used to fit an empirical <b>labor</b> <b>hour</b> curve for each truck. Mean cumulative labor hours within fixed mileage intervals are estimated by averaging across these curves. This approach has the advantage of being easy to program and it does not require the entire history of the life of each truck. (2) Locally weighted regression (loess) : Loess is a nonparametric method of fitting a regression surface to data by local fitting of linear or low order polynomial functions of the independent variables. The loess function contained in S-Plus is used to estimate the overall mean <b>labor</b> <b>hour</b> curve. Selection of the neighborhood parameter in the presence of heteroscedastic errors is achieved by a modification of the M-Plot. Bootstrap methods are used to estimate standard errors. (3) A longitudinal analysis using a mixed model: Cumulative annual labor hours are regarded as longitudinal data where each unit is observed at a different set of unequally spaced time points. Mixed models, with an overall mean curve for all the units (fixed effects) and an individual curve for each unit (random effects) are considered;Relative advantages and disadvantages of the three methods are discussed.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} the study of part timer-workers at Ni Hao restaurant. Ni Hao restaurant is different from other restaurants. It is divided into two parts, namely : wok and ala carte restaurant. The capacity is very huge especially for the wok restaurant, around 600 - 700 seats. It requires a lot of workers both part timers and full timers. This condition creates two major "concerned cost", food and beverage cost, and labor cost. Labor issues are still the number one concern of most restaurant owners and managers. Food and beverage costs can still held in check through price adjustments, portion controls and through purchasing efficiencies. But on the other hand, labor costs are not controlled by paying low wages. This is very controverting with the demand of every restaurant, minimizing the labor cost. Solving the problems an employing part-time workers can be an efficient way to keep costs down which is can be controlled through scheduling and improving labor productivity.

40|$|WHY is ther reductio of <b>labor</b> <b>hours</b> now needed? Recently the necessityto reduce <b>labor</b> <b>hours</b> of Japanese workers {{has been}} insisted on by labor unions, Ministry of Labor, labor economists, and so forth. Originally the {{reduction}} wasrequested by foreign countries to reduce Japan's large trade surplus, because Japanese workers work {{too much and}} consume less, including imported goods,compared with those in other advanced countries. Some radical critics assert thenecessity of changing Japan's national character {{from that of the}} worker bee toa more relaxed one. The way to solve the problem on the basis of economics, however, is not to reform the preference curve of nations but to discover theeconomic mechanism behind the problem, and to improve the welfare of naitions. Ifit is true that Japanese workers prefer to work rather than to enjoy leisuretime, we first have to rewrite the indifference map between income and leisure. Concerning the realization of <b>labor</b> <b>hours</b> reduction, there may be two prob lems that we have to mention. One is how it affects Japan's potential power ofeconomic growth. A policy maker is worried about the slowdown of the GNPgrowth rate caused by the reduction of labor input. Another problem is the influenceon a firm's business performance. A manager of a firm does not welcomea reduction in <b>labor</b> <b>hours</b> which might affect the availability of workers, and suppressthe firm's profit badly. To promote the reduction, therefore, we first haveto convince them of its merit. Yoshioka[2] is one of the interesting studies whichfocuses on the good aspects of <b>labor</b> <b>hours</b> reduction. He attempted to measureits effect on a firm's productivity by introducing `working efficiency function'. He assumed that as working hours become longer, the efficiency first rises, thenstops rising, and finally starts declining. Under this assumption as the result offirm's profit maximization, the <b>labor</b> <b>hours</b> can be determined as the endogenousvariable. The comparative statics in his model showed that the rise of premiumwage for overtime work has the effect of shortening working hours of employeesin a firm. In addition to that, the output level does not decline so much as laborhours because of existence of the efficiency function. The implication of Yoshioka's model is certainly very suggestive, because itpointed out an important issue that previous studies had failed to notice. In hismodel, however, there is one important problem in that it does not include thereaction of a labor supplier. In other words, the model cannot explain the changeof an employee's utility after the reduction of <b>labor</b> <b>hours</b> is realized. Althoughthe <b>labor</b> <b>hours</b> reduction is Japan's national consensus, an employee does notagree with any kind of reduction that may reduce his utility level. The reductionis really effective only if an employee's utility is improved. In this paper I would like to explain the mechanism of overtime work with themodel including the behavior both of a firm and its employees. On the basis of afirm's profit maximization and the employee's utility maximization, I will show the reason why the reduction does not progress and also show that its realizationcan improve both the welfare of workers and the profit of firms...|$|R
