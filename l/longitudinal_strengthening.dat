5000|$|In 1795, Sir Samuel Bentham, {{inspector}} of dockyards of the Royal Navy, {{and designer}} of six new sailing ships, {{argued for the}} adoption of [...] "partitions contributing to strength, and securing the ship against foundering, as practiced by the Chinese of the present day". His idea was not adopted. Bentham had been in China in 1782, and he acknowledged that he had got the idea of watertight compartments by looking at Chinese junks there. Bentham {{was a friend of}} Isambard Brunel, so it is possible that he had some influence on Brunel's adoption of <b>longitudinal,</b> <b>strengthening</b> bulkheads in the lower deck of the SS Great Britain. Bentham had already by this time designed and had built a segmented barge for use on the Volga River, so the idea of transverse hull separation was evidently in his mind. Perhaps more to the point, there is a very large difference between the transverse bulkheads in Chinese construction, which offer no <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strengthening,</b> and the longitudinal members which Brunel adopted, almost certainly inspired by the iron bridge and boiler engineering in which he and his contemporaries in iron shipbuilding innovation were most versed.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Mesopotamian cuneiform texts speak of a complex and well-organized trade on the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers where boats of wooden construction were employed. From the evidence it appears that Meluhhan and Dilmunite traders had {{an important role in the}} Arabian Gulf trade especially during the second half of the third millennium B. C. It is possible that the boat designs and techniques used in the third millennium B. C. are no longer present in traditional boats of present-day Iraq and those of oceangoing vessels sailing in the modern day Arabian Gulf. Based on iconographic evidence, it seems that Mesopotamian riverboats had flat bottoms and high curving ends, with a stem often ending in an elaborate design. Cultic vessels imitated the shape of a papyriform vessel. The riverine vessels in practical use described in texts, such as AO 5673, most probably had square ends. The use of bitumen might have allowed the Mesopotamian shipwrights to build hulls in which watertightness (before the application of a bitumen layer) was not the primary concern. Mesopotamian textual evidence from the third millennium B. C. does not provide conclusive evidence as to which edge-joining methods, if any, were used. Traditional modern-day Mesopotamian riverboats, some of which seem to be clear descendants of the ancient vessels depicted in seals and boat models, do not employ edge-joining methods. Instead, they are built according to a technique where the planking is nailed to the frames. In spite of textual references to "backbone" and "ribs," it is unclear whether Mesopotamian ships had an elaborate internal framework connected to a keel. It is probable that these vessels had a keel plank or a flat floor similar to certain traditional modern-day riverboats. Structural elements evident from the texts are beams and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strengthening</b> timbers or stringers. It also seems clear that there were floor timbers and probably frames giving extra support to the hull...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the shear behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened by jacketing the surfaces of the beams using ultra-high performance fiber reinforced concrete (UHPC). The surfaces of the RC beams were prepared by sandblasting and UHPC was cast in situ over the surfaces of RC beams. The beams were strengthened using two different strengthening configurations; (i) two <b>longitudinal</b> sides <b>strengthening</b> (ii) three sides strengthening. The bond between normal concrete and UHPC was examined by conducting splitting tensile strength and slant shear strength tests on composite cylindrical specimens cast using normal concrete and UHPC. The control and strengthened beam specimens were tested using four-point loading arrangement maintaining different shear span-to-depth ratios. The results of tested beams showed the beneficial effects of strengthening the RC beams using UHPC, as evident from enhancement of the shear capacity and shifting of the failure mode from brittle to ductile with more stiff behavior. In addition, a non-linear finite element model (FEM) was developed to examine the sufficiency of the experimental results used to study the shear behavior of control and strengthened beams. The failure loads and the crack patterns determined experimentally matched well with those predicted using the proposed model with a reasonably good degree of accuracy.|$|R

Previous analyses based on the decennial Census are subject to bias due to nonrandom return migration. Using 40 years of longitudinal data on a nationally representative sample of natives and immigrants, I show that Census-based estimates of assimilation in earnings are biased upwards. This bias is due to less successful immigrants within an entry cohort leaving the U. S. over time, and the bias is substantial mainly for non-Hispanic white immigrants. Longitudinal analysis reveals that non-Hispanic white immigrants actually suffer earnings losses with time in the U. S., net of aging and time effects. <b>Longitudinal</b> data also <b>strengthen</b> the conclusion that more recent entry cohorts of non-Hispanic white immigrants have lower earnings than their counterparts who immigrated earlier...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{stitching}} {{methods used}} to repair and strengthen cracks or joints in concrete pave-ment. The first, and most common, is cross-stitching. Cross-stitching uses deformed tie bars epoxied or grouted into holes drilled at an angle through a crack.

Recommendations on where to use these methods are outlined in this special report. Stitching is applicable {{for a number of}} situations where strengthening joints or cracks is required.

To serve scalp electroencephalography (EEG) research environments for the laboratory mice, the dry non-invasive scalp EEG sensor with sixteen electrodes is proposed to measure brainwaves over the entire brain area without any surgical procedures. We validated the proposed sensor system with visual evoked potential (VEP) experiments elicited by flash stimulations. The VEP responses obtained from experiments are compared with the existing literature, and analyzed in temporal and spatial perspectives. We further interpret the experimental results using time-frequency distribution (TFD) and distance measurements.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} work-related measurements, body composition, physical activity, and fitness levels to predict neck/shoulder pain (upper body pain, UBP) {{at the age of}} 52 years. Another aim was to {{investigate the}} cross-sectional relationships between UBP, work-related factors, and individual factors at the age of 52 years. METHODS: We followed a randomly selected cohort of 429 adolescents that was recruited in 1974 (baseline), when they were 16 years old. The participants completed physical fitness tests, questions about sociodemographic and lifestyle factors at 16, 34, and 52 years of age, and questions about work-related factors and pain in the follow-ups. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations between UBP and the other variables. RESULTS: Univariate logistic regression analyses showed that high body mass index and the work-related factors, low control, and low social support at the age of 34 years were related to UBP at the age of 52 years. For social support, there was an interaction between men and women where the relationship between low social support and the experience of pain was more evident for women. Among women, body mass index and social support remained significantly related in the multivariate analyses. For men, social support remained significantly related. Cross-sectional relationships at the age of 52 differed from the longitudinal in the sense that measures of joint flexibility and work posture were also significantly associated with UBP. CONCLUSION: The fact that the cross-sectional differed from the <b>longitudinal</b> relationships <b>strengthens</b> the importance of performing longitudinal studies when studying factors that might influence the initiation of pain.

40|$|The European project SUREBridge (Sustainable Refurbishment of Existing Bridges) is develop-ing a {{new concept}} for the {{refurbishment}} of road bridges. The proposed technique takes ad-vantage of the peculiarities of fibre-reinforced materials to perform upgrading, repair, and strengthening in an effective and efficient way in terms of resource consumption, waste produc-tion, construction time, and traffic disruption. The technique applies to bridges with reinforced concrete slab and longitudinal girders made of either reinforced concrete or steel. <b>Longitudinal</b> girders are <b>strengthened</b> by bonding carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates to their bottom surfaces. Higher structural perfor-mances are achieved by pre-stressing the CFRP laminates. The existing concrete slab is not demolished, with savings in both construction time and waste production. Instead, tailor-made glass fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) panels {{are connected to the}} deck to increase its overall bending strength. Furthermore, GFRP panels enable the widening of the road section, if neces-sary to upgrade the bridge to increased traffic demand. This paper presents the application of the SUREBridge technique to a real bridge located in San Miniato, Tuscany, Italy. The designed intervention includes both the widening of the road section and the structural strengthening of the deck to comply with current traffic loads...|$|R

40|$|A {{timely and}} applied {{approach}} to the newly discovered methods and applications of U-statisticsBuilt on years of collaborative research and academic experience, Modern Applied U-Statistics successfully presents a thorough introduction {{to the theory of}} U-statistics using in-depth examples and applications that address contemporary areas of study including biomedical and psychosocial research. Utilizing a "learn by example" approach, this book provides an accessible, yet in-depth, treatment of U-statistics, as well as addresses key concepts in asymptotic theory by integrating translational and cross-disciplinary research. The authors begin with an introduction of the essential and theoretical foundations of U-statistics such as the notion of convergence in probability and distribution, basic convergence results, stochastic Os, inference theory, generalized estimating equations, as well as the definition and asymptotic properties of U-statistics. With an emphasis on nonparametric applications when and where applicable, the authors then build upon this established foundation in order to equip readers with the knowledge needed to understand the modern-day extensions of U-statistics that are explored in subsequent chapters. Additional topical coverage includes:Longitudinal data modeling with missing dataParametric and distribution-free mixed-effect and structural equation modelsA new multi-response based regression framework for non-parametric statistics such as the product moment correlation, Kendall''s tau, and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank testsA new class of U-statistic-based estimating equations (UBEE) for dependent responsesMotivating examples, in-depth illustrations of statistical and model-building concepts, and an extensive discussion of <b>longitudinal</b> study designs <b>strengthen</b> the real-world utility and comprehension of this book.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Lodging in cereals {{can cause}} {{significant}} decreases in yield. It {{is both a}} problem in susceptible cereal cultivars with a tall-stemmed, weak-strawed growing habit and in lodging-resistant cereal cultivars when they are grown under high-nitrogen, high-moisture regimes. Plant growth regulators (PGR's) are chemical growth retardants that offer a method of lodging control. For the susceptible cultivars that are not amenable to genetic shortening through plant breeding, PGR's accomplish on a seasonal basis what has not been possible through gene manipulation. For cultivars that become susceptible in the high-intensive systems of modern agriculture, PGR's can {{be integrated into the}} chemical regime to control the lodging-promoting conditions created by yield-promotion practices. Morex spring barley is a lodging-susceptible cultivar that is tall-stemmed and weak-strawed. This growth habit aggravates the lodging problem when Morex is grown under intensive yield-promoting conditions. In greenhouse and field experiments, chemical control of the Morex lodging tendency was tested with an experimental chemical, Paclobutrazol. Paclobutrazol acts on the endogenous gibberellin hormone system in the plant by inhibiting its synthesis. The chemical's effect on the cereal plant is reported to occur in the internodes which Paclobutrazol shortens by decreasing <b>longitudinal</b> growth and <b>strengthens</b> by increasing transverse growth. Lodging control is realized through height reduction which lessens the torque effect created by the weather conditions that actually cause the event of lodging to occur. Paclobutrazol caused significant shortening of the basal internodes in the greenhouse and field experiments. Uncharacteristic of the expected effect, the PGR did not strengthen the shortened internodes. Specific stem weight and breaking strength values for the treated plants were significantly lower than the corresponding control values. In the field, Paclobutrazol delayed lodging until after the critical lodging period that occurs from approximately 15 days before anthesis to 15 days after anthesis. Lodging control was reflected in yield increases. Treated plots yielded significantly higher than did the control plots. The two high treatments of 800 and 1000 g/ha also yielded significantly higher than did the low treatments of 400 and 600 g/ha. Yield increases in the treated plots can be attributed to improved seed filling given the fact that lodging in the control plots occurred during the period when yield losses are caused by poor seed development. Unfortunately, the data did not give any clear indication of other possible sources of yield enhancement. Beneficial effects of Paclobutrazol on the tillering and inflorescence development that several researchers have reported for the PGR, Chlormequat, were not evident. The experiments showed that Paclobutrazol is effective on Morex spring barley as a chemical lodging control agent and yield enhancer. A clear association of reduced height with lodging control and concomitantly with yield increases was shown by the data. The absence of improved stem strength raised questions concerning the mechanism of Paclobutrazol's effect on the barley species and the possible mechanism of its effect in combination with nitrogen fertility...|$|R
3000|$|Figure  7 {{shows the}} {{variation}} of energy shares with incident direction θ 0 for three different values of embedded porous fraction (ɛ[*]=[*]r/R). It is noted {{that all the}} <b>longitudinal</b> waves are <b>strengthened</b> with decrease of ɛ and their variational patterns are almost alike with respect to ɛ. However, very little impact of ɛ is observed on the energy share of the SV wave near grazing incidence. The energy share of the slower P 3 wave is almost negligible in comparison {{with all the other}} waves. For θ_ 0 ∈ (0, [...] 90 ^∘ [...]), the interaction energy ERR {{plays a major role in}} energy conservation for ɛ[*]=[*] 1 / 4. The interaction energy EIR plays a major role in energy conservation near grazing incidence for all values of ɛ. It is clearly visible from the figure that at both normal and grazing incidences the most of incident energy is carried by the SV wave for all the values of ɛ. The effect of pore-fluid viscosity η on the energy shares is shown in Fig.  8. It is observed that the variational pattern of P 1 and P 2 waves is almost alike with respect to η. The P 1 and P 2 waves are weakened with an increase of η for θ_ 0 ∈ (0, [...] 90 ^∘ [...]). For incidence below 70 °, the SV wave is not sensitive to changes in η while beyond 70 °, it decreases with an increase in η. A significant impact of η is seen on the P 3 wave and interaction energies, particularly on ERR. The impact of size (r) of the embedded sphere on the variation of energy shares with incident direction θ 0 is exhibited in Fig.  9. For θ_ 0 ∈ (0, [...] 60 ^∘ [...]), almost negligible impact of r is observed on P 1 and SV waves. The P 1 and SV waves are weakened with the increase of r beyond 60 °. The impact of size (r) of the embedded sphere is significant on P 2, P 3 waves and interaction energies. The variation of energy shares with incident direction θ 0 in the presence and absence of WIFF is shown in Fig.  10. It is observed that for P 1 and SV waves, the curve corresponds to the presence of WIFF for θ 0 [*]<[*] 45 °. The P 1 and SV waves are weakened a lot in the presence of WIFF in comparison with the absence of WIFF beyond 45 °. The slower P waves are weakened a lot in the presence of WIFF in comparison with the absence of WIFF in almost the whole range of θ 0. Figure  11 displays the effect of pore characteristics (i.e., open pores and close pores) on the variation of energy shares with incident direction θ 0. Near normal and grazing incidences, the impact of pore characteristics is not observed on both P 1 and SV waves. It is observed that for fully closed surface pores, the P 1 (SV) wave becomes stronger in the range 15 °[*]<[*]θ 0 [*]<[*] 40 ° (45 °[*]<[*]θ 0 [*]<[*] 85 °). The variational pattern of slower p waves is almost alike irrespective of surface pores being opened or closed. For fully opened surface pores, slower P 2 and P 3 waves are strengthened a lot. Figure  12 exhibits the effect of wave frequency (ω) on the variation of energy shares. It is observed that the energy shares of longitudinal waves increases with the increase of frequency. The effect of frequency on the SV wave is observed near grazing incidence only. The effect of frequency on interaction energy ERR is much significant in comparison with EIR.|$|R
40|$|Job {{satisfaction}} {{is a significant}} predictor of organisational innovation – especially where employees (including shop-floor workers) experience variety in their jobs and work in a single-status environment. The relationship between job satisfaction and performance has long intrigued work psychologists. The idea that "happy workers are productive workers" underpins many theories of performance, leadership, reward and job design. But contrary to popular belief, the relationship between job satisfaction and performance at individual level {{has been shown to be}} relatively weak. Research investigating the link between job satisfaction and creativity (the antecedent to innovation) shows that job dissatisfaction promotes creative outcomes. The logic is that those who are dissatisfied (and have decided to stay with the organisation) are determined to change things and have little to lose in doing so (see JM George & J Zhou, 2002). We were therefore surprised to find in the course of our own research into managerial practices and employee attitudes in manufacturing organisations that job satisfaction was a highly significant predictor of product and technological innovation. These results held even though the research was conducted longitudinally, over two years, while controlling for prior innovation. In other words, job satisfaction was a stronger predictor of innovation than any pre-existing orientation organisations had towards working innovatively. Using prior innovation as a control variable, as well as a <b>longitudinal</b> research design, <b>strengthened</b> our case against the argument that people are satisfied because they belong to a highly innovative organisation. We found that the relationship between job satisfaction and innovation was stronger still where organisations showed that they were committed to promoting job variety, especially at shop-floor level. We developed precise instruments to measure innovation, taking into account the magnitude of the innovation both in terms of the number of people involved in its implementation, and how new and different it was. Using this instrument, we are able to give each organisation in our sample a "score" from one to seven for innovation in areas ranging from administration to production technology. We found that much innovation is incremental, involving relatively minor improvements, rather than major change. To achieve sustained innovation, organisations have to draw on the skills and knowledge of employees at all levels. We also measured job satisfaction at organisational level, constructing a mean "job satisfaction" score for all organisations in our sample, and drawing only on those companies whose employees tended to respond in a similar manner to the questions they were asked. We argue that where most of the workforce experience job satisfaction, employees are more likely to collaborate, to share ideas and aim for high standards because people are keen to sustain their positive feelings. Job variety and single-status arrangements further strengthen the relationship between satisfaction and performance. This makes sense; where employees experience variety, they are exposed to new and different ideas and, provided they feel positive about their jobs, are likely to be willing to try to apply these ideas to improve their jobs. Similarly, staff working in single-status environments where hierarchical barriers are reduced are likely to feel trusted and valued by management and there is evidence (see G Jones & J George, 1998) that people work collaboratively and constructively with those they trust. Our study suggests that there is a strong business case for promoting employee job satisfaction. Managers and HR practitioners need to ensure their strategies and practices support and sustain job satisfaction among their workforces to encourage constructive, collaborative and creative working. It is more important than ever for organisations to respond rapidly to demands of the external environment. This study shows the positive association between organisational-level job satisfaction and innovation. So if a happy workforce is the key to unlocking innovation and organisations want to thrive in the global economy, it is vital that managers and HR practitioners pay close attention to employee perceptions of the work environment. In a world where the most innovative survive it could make all the difference...|$|R
