5|$|The third era {{deviates}} {{from the}} original plot considerably. When Lara was young she travelled with her parents on many of their archaeological expeditions which helped to shape the woman she was becoming. It was {{on one of these}} expeditions that her mother vanished and was presumed dead and a few years later her father presumably took his own life, she was then left in the care of Conrad Roth. Even though she was left with a vast fortune, giving her the means to attend Cambridge with ease, Lara chose to study at University College London. This decision required her to pay her tuition and rent by working many jobs. Though this was a much tougher choice, it helped her become more grounded and level-headed than she might otherwise have been. She also ended up meeting her best friend, Samantha Nishimura, during her time at UCL. It was because of Sam's free spirit and wild streak that Lara was able to experience much more of London than just the universities and museums that she <b>loved</b> <b>so</b> much. After travelling the world, both Lara and Sam end up on an expedition to the Dragon's Triangle off the Japanese coast in search of the lost civilisation of Yamatai. It is on this expedition that Lara is stranded on a remote island full of natural, human and supernatural dangers, which enables her to develop from a vulnerable girl to a survivor. And after experiencing the supernatural powers of the ancient world, she comes to realise her father was right about his theories and her hunger for adventure awakens.|$|E

25|$|Bobby Cash {{grew up in}} Clement Town, Dehradun. An aunt of his, {{who lived}} in Nashville, Tennessee, {{regularly}} sent the latest country music releases of the time to Bobby's mother. This was the music he {{grew up listening to}} and which he <b>loved</b> <b>so</b> much that he taught himself to play the guitar and sing those songs. Because of the dearth of other country music style genre musicians, he developed his own guitar style that encompassed playing bass lines, rhythm, finger-picking and lead to give a unique sound.|$|E
500|$|Regarding his remix of the album, O'Brien stated, [...] "The band {{loved the}} {{original}} mix of Ten, but were {{also interested in}} what it would sound like if I were to deconstruct and remix it...The original Ten sound is what millions of people bought, dug and <b>loved,</b> <b>so</b> I was initially hesitant to mess around with that. After years of persistent nudging from the band, I was able to wrap my head around the idea of offering it as a companion piece to the original—giving a fresh take on it, a more direct sound." ...|$|E

500|$|Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com {{called it}} a [...] "great little episode" [...] and strong setup for the season finale. Although Sundermann {{initially}} had reservations about Leslie and Ben getting together, he now said it felt real because Leslie was willing to risk a job she <b>loved</b> <b>so</b> much to be with him. Paste magazine writer Garrett Martin said {{although the idea of}} pairing two co-workers felt like a conventional television move, he did not mind with Leslie and Ben because they are such a [...] "charming and well-matched pair". Martin also said Pamela Reed [...] "absolutely kills it" [...] as Leslie's mother. Rick Porter of Zap2it said Parks and Recreation was at the [...] "top of its game", and that [...] "The Bubble" [...] worked well paired along with the season finale [...] "Li'l Sebastian". He praised the comedic and romantic chemistry between Amy Poehler and Adam Scott, and said the subplot with Chris imposing changes on the parks department was [...] "great fun".|$|E
500|$|Sullivan's {{best known}} contrapuntal device was [...] "the {{simultaneous}} presentation {{of two or}} more distinct melodies previously heard independently". He was not the first composer to combine themes in this way, but it became a characteristic feature of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] Sometimes the melodies were for solo voices, as in [...] "Once more the face I <b>loved</b> <b>so</b> well" [...] (The Zoo), and [...] "I am so proud" [...] (The Mikado), which combines three melodic lines; other examples are in choruses, where typically a graceful tune for the ladies is combined with a robust one for the men. Examples include [...] "When the Foeman bares his steel" [...] (The Pirates of Penzance), [...] "In a doleful train" [...] (Patience) and [...] "Welcome, gentry" [...] (Ruddigore). At other times, notably in [...] "How beautifully blue the sky" [...] (The Pirates of Penzance), one theme is given to the chorus and the other to solo voices.|$|E

500|$|Robert C. Cooper {{intended}} the episode as [...] "an emotional {{tribute to the}} ten seasons that [...] come before" [...] and [...] "the last chapter in the book – but not necessarily in the series of books. It was a chance , using science fiction, to show people one version of what the future might be like for these characters that they've {{spent so much time}} with and <b>loved</b> <b>so</b> much." [...] By killing off the Asgard race, Cooper gave the episode an element of tragedy that reflected his feelings at the time. Producer Brad Wright wanted all of the characters to get a last shot in the spotlight instead of focusing on only one character. Because of fan vocality about team episodes, Cooper decided to put the characters through several decades of life and see their relationships develop and evolve. The references in [...] "Unending" [...] to the events of season 2's [...] "The Fifth Race", another Cooper-penned episode often named as a fan favorite, were intended, as were the callbacks to season 9's [...] "The Ties That Bind" [...] (the Daniel-Vala argument, see below) and season 10's [...] "Line In The Sand" [...] (the solution of using the Ori beam). The period aboard the ship was originally significantly less than fifty years, but the actors' last-stage makeup, which Cooper only saw minutes before filming, looked so old that Cooper was forced {{to increase the number of}} years in the script.|$|E
500|$|With the 2012 {{continuation}} of Dallas, {{there was talk}} of some Knots Landing characters returning to air. Rumors began surfacing that both Van Ark and Shackelford would reprise their roles as Valene and Gary. Ted Shackelford passed on the small role the producers offered him to reprise his role as Gary Ewing on the new series. [...] Van Ark refuted the claims, saying: [...] "Well, rumor has it… I’m having lunch with Ted tomorrow. They asked him to come down and be part of it. It was several months ago, and he’s deeply into filming The Young and the Restless, the daytime soap for CBS. But if they asked Gary, maybe they’ll ask [...]" [...] She would, however, love to be involved if the producers asked her, especially to torment fellow cast-member Larry Hagman. [...] "There is no doubt about it. This man I <b>loved</b> <b>so</b> much, Larry Hagman… I was just at his birthday party several months ago… I would kill, that if Val came back, if it was trouble for J.R.. Because they were always at odds." [...] However, Gary and Valene's daughter, Lucy Ewing, along with Ray Krebbs have made appearances in the new series. Although both Shackleford and Van Ark appeared in the 1991 series finale of Dallas playing [...] "alternative" [...] versions of Gary and Valene (the episode depicted a fantasy world in which J.R. had never been born), there have been no real crossovers of story or characters from Knots Landing to Dallas or vice versa since the 1985-86 season of each show (which, on Dallas, {{turned out to be a}} dream had by Pamela Ewing).|$|E
500|$|The WWF {{received}} some support {{from people who}} felt that the company {{did the right thing}} by continuing the event. Vince Russo, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that Brian Pillman, a family friend of the Harts and a member of The Hart Foundation, died shortly before the [...] pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, [...] "I have a lot to say and I will say it. I promise you that. But {{this is not the time}} to do it.... Give me a few days. Give me to the end of the week. Then we'll talk." [...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he <b>loved</b> <b>so</b> much." ...|$|E

However, Merlin fails in his attempt to stab the Dark One, only to drop the knife in shock, saying that he can't do it. The Dark One then picks up the dagger, and holds it to Merlin's neck, with Merlin telling the Dark One that he [...] "misses her." [...] However, the Dark One uses the Dagger to collect a teardrop from Merlin instead, which causes the Dagger to briefly glow purple, and turns him (Merlin) into a tree.|$|E

They have produced some musical gems, now standards, like [...] "Les filles des Forges", [...] "Les prisons de Nantes", [...] "La Jument de Michao", [...] "Pelot d'Hennebont", and new interpretation of Irish music, like [...] "Cad é sin don té sin", [...] "Si mort a mors" [...] (originally An Cailín Rua), [...] "La ville que j'ai tant aimée" [...] (from [...] "The town I <b>loved</b> <b>so</b> well"), [...] "Mrs McDermott" [...] (from the 17th-century Irish harpist Ó Carolan) and [...] "Kalonkadour" [...] (from [...] "Planxty Irwin").|$|E
