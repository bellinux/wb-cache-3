25|$|A {{joint report}} by the Underground and its {{maintenance}} contractor Tube Lines concluded that poor track geometry was the main cause, and that, because of this, extra friction arising out of striations (scratches) on a newly installed set of points had allowed the <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> of the last carriage to climb the rail and so derail. The track geometry at the derailment site is a very tight bend and tight tunnel bore, which precludes the normal solution {{for this sort of}} geometry of canting the track by raising the height of one rail relative to the other.|$|E
50|$|Like the Neilson-built 4th Class 4-6-0TT of 1882, these {{locomotives}} {{were built}} with Joy valve gear, {{but they had}} smaller coupled wheels of 38+1/2 in diameter. The coupled wheels were not spaced equidistant from each other, with a wheelbase of 3 ft between the <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> and the driver and 4 ft between the driver and the trailing wheel.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> or {{leading axle}} or pilot {{wheel of a}} steam {{locomotive}} is an unpowered wheel or axle located {{in front of the}} driving wheels. The axle or axles of the leading wheels are normally located on a leading truck. Leading wheels are used to help the locomotive negotiate curves and to support the front portion of the boiler.|$|E
50|$|Until 1959, 145 Class 03 {{locomotives}} {{were in the}} Deutsche Bundesbahn's operating fleet, {{of which}} 62 engines (03 005 to 03 122) had air and feed pumps on the smokebox, small <b>leading</b> <b>wheels</b> (850 mm diameter) and {{a top speed of}} 120 km/h, 16 machines (03 127 to 03 160) had air and feed pumps between the middle and rear driving <b>wheels,</b> small <b>leading</b> <b>wheels</b> (850 mm diameter) and a top speed of 120 km/h and 67 engines (03 164 to 03 296) had air and feed pumps between the middle and rear driving wheels, scissor-block brakes (Scherenklotzbremsen), large <b>leading</b> <b>wheels</b> (1,000 mm diameter) and a top speed of 130 km/h.|$|R
5000|$|Under the Whyte {{notation}} for {{the classification}} of steam locomotives, 2-2-2-2 could represent either the wheel arrangement of two <b>leading</b> <b>wheels</b> on one axle, four powered but uncoupled driving wheels on two axles, and two trailing wheels on one axle, or of two sets of <b>leading</b> <b>wheels</b> (not in a bogie truck), two driving wheels on one axle, and two trailing wheels [...]|$|R
50|$|Due to uneven weight {{distribution}} the axle {{load on the}} <b>leading</b> <b>wheels</b> was 169.7 kN {{higher than that of}} the driving wheels.|$|R
5000|$|A {{carrying}} wheel on a steam locomotive is a wheel {{that is not}} driven, i.e. it is uncoupled and can run freely, unlike a coupled or driving wheel. It is also described as a running wheel and their axle may be called a carrying axle. A {{carrying wheel}} {{is referred to as}} <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> if it is at the front, or a trailing wheel if it is {{at the rear of the}} locomotive.|$|E
50|$|When {{used for}} equally spaced wheels (i.e. rather than cargo trucks with close-set rear axles) the front two wheels are {{arranged}} so that both steer, the rear less {{so than the}} <b>leading</b> <b>wheel.</b> The varying track radii mean that when the vehicle drives in a curve on firm tarmac each wheel travels a different distance. Without differential action between the wheels on each side, wind-up can occur in the bevels and shafts.|$|E
50|$|It transpired that as {{the train}} {{approached}} the crossing the left hand <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> of the van {{at the front of}} the train had disintegrated and the coupling between the van and the locomotive had parted and the van and two following coaches had run off the rails onto the roadway demolishing a wall, and the crossing gates and posts and killing the mother and sister of a signalman who were waiting at the crossing. In addition six passengers in the two coaches were killed.|$|E
50|$|In Whyte notation, a 2-4-6 is a steam {{locomotive}} with two unpowered <b>leading</b> <b>wheels</b> followed by four powered driving wheels and six unpowered trailing wheels.|$|R
50|$|Under the Whyte {{notation}} for {{the classification}} of steam locomotives, a 2-8-8-8-4 has two <b>leading</b> <b>wheels,</b> three sets of eight driving wheels, and four trailing wheels.|$|R
50|$|Under the Whyte {{notation}} for {{the classification}} of steam locomotives, a 4-8-6 locomotive would have had four <b>leading</b> <b>wheels,</b> eight coupled driving wheels and six trailing wheels.|$|R
50|$|A {{drawback}} to the H-drive {{is the risk}} of driveline windup. When used for equally spaced wheels (i.e., rather than cargo trucks with close-set rear axles) the front two wheels are arranged so that both steer, the rear less so than the <b>leading</b> <b>wheel.</b> The varying track radii mean that when the vehicle drives in a curve on firm tarmac each wheel travels a different distance. As there is no differential action between the wheels on each side, this causes a lot of wind-up in the bevels and shafts.|$|E
50|$|A {{joint report}} by London Underground and its {{maintenance}} contractor Tube Lines concluded that poor track geometry {{was the main}} cause of the derailment and extra friction arising out of striations (scratches) on a newly installed set of points had allowed the <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> of the last carriage to climb the rail and so derail. The track at the derailment site is on a very tight bend in a tight tunnel bore, which prevents canting the track by dipping the height of one rail relative to the other, the normal solution in this sort of situation.|$|E
50|$|The Auto-Truck was one {{of several}} monowheel {{tractors}} to appear in the 1920s and '30s, with the availability of small, reliable petrol engines, as developed for motorcycles and the stationary engines for which Lister were already known. These were tricycle vehicles, with the single <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> used for both drive and steering. Their simple construction carried most of the mechanism on this wheel as a single unit, the chassis with the trailing wheels being little more than a trailer for balance. Simplicity was a key feature. The engines were single-cylinder and air-cooled. Ignition was by magneto, rather than requiring a battery and electrical system.|$|E
50|$|Under the Whyte {{notation}} for {{the classification}} of steam locomotives, 2-2-2-0 usually represents the wheel arrangement of two <b>leading</b> <b>wheels</b> on one axle, four powered but uncoupled driving wheels on two axles, and no trailing wheels, but {{can also be used}} to represent two sets of <b>leading</b> <b>wheels</b> (not in a bogie truck) two driving wheels, and no trailing wheels. Some authorities place brackets around the duplicated but uncoupled wheels, creating a notation 2-(2-2)-0, or (2-2)-2-0, as a means of differentiating between them. Others simply refer to the locomotives 2-2-2-0.|$|R
50|$|A 6-4-4-6 steam locomotive, in the Whyte {{notation}} {{for describing}} locomotive wheel arrangements, is one with six <b>leading</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{two sets of}} four driving wheels, and six trailing wheels.|$|R
50|$|Tyre wear {{was reduced}} by {{supplying}} jets of water, fed from 1/2 in diameter pipes, to the <b>leading</b> <b>wheels</b> while negotiating curves. This {{was found to}} diminish friction significantly.|$|R
5000|$|The motor tramcar {{was driven}} by fast DK-254А engines, with a power of [...] per each. Two step {{reductor}} {{was used as a}} power transmission from a traction motor to the <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> pair. In the rear wheel pair a two step reductor with a kardan of an automobile type was in use. The tram was driven using the fist-like controller МТ-22 or МТ-1. The tram collected electric power by a bugel', however in Rostov-na-Donu trolley poles were in use. The brakes, and doors were pneumatic. There was a special valve, which lead tram to full stop if a multiple unit was broken. The hand brake also existed.|$|E
50|$|Colonel Pringle of the Railway Inspectorate found part of {{the broken}} tyre 50 yd away in a field, the {{left-hand}} <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> of the engine having broken. The tread had broken from a large internal blow hole. The defect probably formed during the steel casting operation, and became critical as the tread was worn away. The tyre {{had been made in}} 1920, and had run over 100000 mi before failure. All the other wheels from the same batch were removed from service and broken up, but without finding any cavities in the treads. Pringle also showed how tyre fractures had decreased over the years. In 1880, there were 1238 broken tyres, 577 ten years later and by 1900, the number had dropped to 234. The majority were found on wagons, but by 1920, there were only 20 wheel failures. The drop in failure rate was due to the introduction of the monobloc steel wheel and better inspection and maintenance methods.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, a train derailed at Camden Town. Although {{no one was}} hurt, points, {{signals and}} {{carriages}} were damaged, and the junctions there were not used while repairs were under way: trains coming from Edgware worked the Bank branch only, and trains from High Barnet and Mill Hill East worked the Charing Cross branch only. This situation was resolved when the junctions reopened, after much repair work and safety analysis and testing by contractor, on 7 March 2004.A joint report by the Underground and its maintenance contractor Tube Lines concluded that poor track geometry was the main cause, and that, because of this, extra friction arising out of striations (scratches) on a newly installed set of points had allowed the <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> of the last carriage to climb the rail and so derail.

40|$|Abstract. To {{avoid the}} open {{problems}} of the <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> and get a more rational structure, the paper uses PRO / E and the finite element software to analyze the <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> of JKM- 3. 25 / 4 multi-rope friction hoist. The results show that in the <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> the rib plates between the channel steel and wheel hub are removed or added the same ones will have {{little effect on the}} overall force situation, and only affect the stress of the weld bead. To solve the problem of open weld of rib plates, can consider the rib plates to be removed. When the radial angle between support wheel and drum is bigger than 6 °, the overall force of the <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> is affected seriously. But when the radial angle is 5 °, the amplitude of stress fluctuation is the minimum, which can improve the <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> working conditions and increase the service life of the <b>leading</b> <b>wheel.</b> Therefore the suggestion is to take the radial angle of 5 ° when to design the new multi-rope hoist. Study conclusions provide the theoretical supports for the <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> of multi-rope friction design and technical renovation...|$|E
40|$|The worn wheel {{profiles}} {{generated by}} uni-directional wagon travel produce different profile shapes {{on the leading}} and trailing wheelsets of each bogie. In the case examined both leading and trailing wheels wear to profiles having greater effective wheel conicity. The leading worn wheels exhibit flange and tread wear and the worn profile has highly non-linear conicity having little vertical displacement over the middle range of lateral displacement. A large vertical displacement is still achieved by the worn <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> profile in the last section of the flangeway clearance. The worn trailing wheels have only tread wear with near linear effective conicity across the flangeway. The hunting instability performances of the vehicle with the uni-directional wheel wear profiles is shown {{to have a higher}} critical speed than new wheel profiles due to the mismatch of the leading and trailing wheel profiles. The leading wheels of the bogie hunt with a wavelength of 26 - 30 m whilst the trailing wheels hunt at a wavelength of 12 - 16 m. Because of the differing frequency responses in the front and rear wheelsets of each bogie, lateral instability is damped for the worn wheel profiles. The worn profiles’ curving performance is also improved due to increases in the total profile conicity. Individually the <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> worn profile with its non-linear conicity across the flangeway has lower critical speed than a new wheel profile, the non-linear shape leading to chaotic lateral instability. The trailing wheel profile with its highly linear conicity across the middle of the flangeway has classic sinusoidal hunting at a much reduced critical speed and much reduced wavelength. The worn wheel profiles by themselves for both <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> and trailing wheel are found to have critical speeds 80 % of the new wheel profile critical speed. In combination as found in a wagon operating in one direction, the leading and trailing wheel profiles produce a critical hunting speed 125 % of the new wheel profiles’ critical hunting speed...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the ooze dredging concepts in the protected areas of harbour docks. The proposed method and system for ooze dredging are dedicated to all types of seabed protection, but the main concern are the geotextile mattresses, not resistant to mechanical damages. Due to the large seabed areas covered with this type of protection the effective method of noninvasive ooze dredging should be based on the use of a technical vessel for underwater works. The result of the analysis is the concept of the method and system for ooze dredging including in particular the mechanism for the automatic holding of the suction-dredge head in the proper distance from the seabed protection surface - the <b>leading</b> <b>wheel</b> truck and buoyancy-ballast system...|$|E
