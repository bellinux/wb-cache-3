5|$|The SI base {{units are}} the {{building}} blocks of the system and all other units are derived from them. When Maxwell first introduced the concept of a coherent system, he identified three quantities that could be used as base units: mass, length and time. Giorgi later identified the need for an electrical base unit. Theoretically any one of electric current, potential difference, electrical resistance, electrical charge or a number of other quantities could have provided the base unit, with the remaining units then being defined by the laws of physics. In the event, the unit of electric current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for temperature, substance and <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity)</b> were added later.|$|E

25|$|The candela (cd) is the SI unit of <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity,</b> that {{is power}} per unit solid angle {{in a given}} direction, {{weighted}} according to {{the sensitivity of the}} human eye to various colours of light. A typical candle produces light with about 1 candela of <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> in all directions. A lamp can produce higher <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> either by producing more light, or by focusing it tighter. The <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity</b> of a light depends on many factors, including the colour of the light and the eye's sensitivity to that colour, the optics involved, reflector and lens.

25|$|The {{speed of}} light is a {{dimensional}} quantity and so, as has been emphasized in this context by João Magueijo, it cannot be measured. Measurable quantities in physics are, without exception, dimensionless, although they are often constructed as ratios of dimensional quantities. For example, when {{the height of a}} mountain is measured, what is really measured is the ratio of its height to the length of a meter stick. The conventional SI system of units is based on seven basic dimensional quantities, namely distance, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and <b>luminous</b> <b>intensity.</b> These units are defined to be independent and so cannot be described in terms of each other. As an alternative to using a particular system of units, one can reduce all measurements to dimensionless quantities expressed in terms of ratios between the quantities being measured and various fundamental constants such as Newton's constant, the {{speed of light}} and Planck's constant; physicists can define at least 26 dimensionless constants which can be expressed in terms of these sorts of ratios and which are currently thought to be independent of one another. By manipulating the basic dimensional constants one can also construct the Planck time, Planck length and Planck energy which make a good system of units for expressing dimensional measurements, known as Planck units.|$|E

30|$|The {{present study}} has its {{origin in the}} claims of road users about the presumed visual {{perturbation}} that the signaling devices using LED as lighting source produced. Specifically, the luminous signals referred as “annoying” had the characteristic of having LEDs individually visible. The sign that represented the signal (a circumference, an arrow, letter, etc.) was formed by the sum of luminous dots and was seen as homogeneous only at a considerable distance. The glare effect was also observed by the laboratory technicians in charge of photometry, who normally observe the signal when centering and adjusting the measurement system. The effect was verified in devices whose emitted <b>luminous</b> <b>intensities</b> were {{not so different from}} those of “conventional” devices, considering the latter as uniformly illuminated (whether they use LEDs or another luminous source).|$|R

An effective approach to ameliorate such interfacial decohesion is introduction, via self-assembly or spin-coating, of covalently bound N(p-C 6 H 4 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 SiCl 3) 3 (TAA) - and 4, 4 ′-bis[(p-trichlorosilylpropylphenyl) phenylamino]biphenyl (TPD-Si 2) -derived adhesion/injection layers at the anode/hole transport layer interface. The resulting angstrom-scale hole transport layers prevent decohesion of vapor-deposited hole transport layers and significantly enhance OLED hole injection fluence. OLEDs fabricated with these modified interfaces exhibit appreciably reduced turn-on voltages, considerably higher <b>luminous</b> <b>intensities,</b> and enhanced thermal robustness versus bare ITO-based control devices. Spin-coated, cross-linked TPD-Si 2 films, in particular, prove to be superior to conventional ITO functionalization interlayers, including copper phthalocyanine, in this regard. The present ITO-functionalized devices achieve maximum external forward quantum efficiencies as high as 1. 2 % and a luminous level of 15 000 cd/m 2 in simple ITO/interlayer/HTL/Alq/Al heterostructures.
