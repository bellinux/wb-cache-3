500|$|In the summer, {{water would}} be used to sluice and pan the dirt, {{separating}} out the heavier gold from gravel. This required miners to construct sluices, which were sequences of wooden boxes [...] long, through which the dirt would be washed; up to 20 of these might be needed for each mining operation. The sluices in turn required <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> usually produced by creating a dam and ditches or crude pipes. [...] "Bench gold" [...] mining on the hill sides could not use sluice lines because water could not be pumped that high up. Instead, these mines used rockers, boxes that moved {{back and forth like a}} cradle, to create the motion needed for separation. Finally, the resulting gold dust could be exported out of the Klondike; exchanged for paper money at the rate of $16 ($430) per troy ounce (ozt) through one of the major banks that opened in Dawson City, or simply used as money when dealing with local traders.|$|E

2500|$|The USSR donated two combat-used Model 1941 T-34s to the United States {{for testing}} {{purposes}} in late 1942. The examinations, performed at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, revealed problems with overall armour build quality, especially of the plate joins and welds, {{as well as the}} use of soft steel combined with shallow surface tempering. Leak issues were noted: [...] "In a heavy rain <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> flows through chinks/cracks, which leads to the disabling of the electrical equipment and even the ammunition". Earlier models of the T-34, until the Model 1942, had cast turrets whose armour was softer than that of the other parts of the tank, and offered poor resistance even to 37mm anti-aircraft shells.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, it was {{believed}} that in order to create dreadlocks, an individual had to refrain from brushing, combing or cutting. This lack of hair grooming results in what is called [...] "free form" [...] or [...] "neglect" [...] dreads, where the hair matts together slowly of its own accord. Such dreads tend to vary greatly in size, width, shape, length, and texture. If the wearer is interested in any uniformity of their dreads, they must pull the matted strands of hair apart to ensure large clumps don't form. In addition, if the wearer wishes for their dreads to be neat and tight, they must continue to separate the matted sections of hair and palm roll them regularly for a period of between [...] 6 to 12 months before their hair is well locked. Generally with this free form dread style, the dreads will remain loose and fluffy until the process of long term rolling has tightened them and they have reached a mature status. Until they reach this mature status, they are at risk of coming open especially with <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> immersion (showers, swimming or washing). [...] Many people use products or wax to assist in the locking process. More over to help with the locking process people turn to using sea salt spray or natural sea salt to dry the hair and accelerate the matting process.|$|E
