40|$|Pedestrian {{protection}} {{is one of}} the key topics of discussion in the area of vehicle safety legislation in Europe and Japan. Leg injuries are the most common injuries found in nonfatal pedestrian accidents. The EC regulation and Euro NCAP are evaluating pedestrian leg protection performance in current vehicles. The TRL <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> is specified by the EC regulation, where Phase 1 took effect during 2005 and a draft phase 2 is scheduled to take effect in 2013. The global technical regulation (GTR) pedestrian protection test protocol was made basically using the TRL <b>legform</b> <b>impactor.</b> However, a flexible <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> has been under development. When the flexible <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> development is fully completed and evaluated, it is possible that both legform impactors may be determined to be useful in the GTR. Thus, the objective of this study is to investigate the characteristics of pedestrian leg protection performance of the frontal area of current vehicles using the TRL <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> and the flexible <b>legform</b> <b>impactor.</b> Different types of vehicles (sedan, sport utility vehicle (SUV), height wagon, and 1 box car) were used. The center of the bumper and center of the side members (i. e., the vehicles main longitudinal beams) were selected as impact locations for the legform impactors tests. This paper discusses an equivalence of injury assessment between the TRL <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> and flexible <b>legform</b> <b>impactor...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”Development, {{calibration}} {{and validation}} of a threedimensional {{model of the}} <b>Legform</b> <b>impactor</b> for pedestrian crash with bumper are presented. Lower limb injury is becoming an increasingly important concern in vehicle safety for both occupants and pedestrians. In order to prevent lower extremity injuries to a pedestrian when struck by a car, {{it is important to}} elucidate the loadings from car front structures on the lower extremities and the injury mechanism caused by these loadings. An impact test procedure with a legform addressing lower limb injuries in car pedestrian accidents has been proposed by EEVC/WG 17. In this study a modified <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> is introduced and validated against EEVC/WG 17 criteria. The finite element model of this legform is developed using LS-DYNA software. Total mass of <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> is 13. 4 kg. Technical specifications including the mass and location of the center of gravity and moment of inertia about a horizontal axis through the respective centre of gravity in femur and tibia are determined. The obtained results of <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> static and dynamic tests are as specified in th...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{pedestrian}} safety during an impact with a vehicle, subsystem tests have been defined to evaluate the aggressiveness of the front-end of cars. These subsystems tests have to be reproducible and {{are representative of the}} three decomposed impacts of the pedestrian with the car: lower leg on the bumper, upper leg on the hood, head on the hood or the windscreen. The velocity, angle and mass of the adult headform impactor and its impact area are invariable parameters. Upper <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> parameters are determined by vehicle characteristics. Lower <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> parameters are invariable (velocity and positioning). Nevertheless, these decoupled tests d...|$|E
40|$|Consumer and {{regulatory}} tests for improvement in pedestrian protection are now firmly established. A {{change in the}} vehicle frontal stiffness profiles {{as a result of}} these tests is less well established. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the knowledge base on the vehicle frontal stiffness in pedestrian impacts. Using data recorded as part of the European New Car Assessment Programme, a series of 139 impact tests using headform and <b>legform</b> <b>impactors</b> were used to calculate the vehicle frontal stiffness profile of eight cars manufactured between 2006 and 2010. To account for one of the limitations of the legform as a device for measuring the stiffness of a surface, a methodology for determining a correction factor using the multi-body modelling software MADYMO is presented. Comparison with previous published work showed that the stiffness of the windscreen was unchanged, but that the stiffnesses of the bonnet and front bumper were reduced...|$|R
40|$|Pedestrians and cyclists are {{the most}} {{unprotected}} road users and their injury risk in case of accidents is significantly higher than for other road users. The understanding of the influence and sensitivity between important variables describing a pedestrian crash is key {{for the development of}} more efficient and reliable safety systems. This paper reflects the related work carried out within the AsPeCSS project. The results summarized out of virtual and physical tests provide valuable information for further development. 1168 virtual and 120 physical tests were carried out with adult and child pedestrian headform as well as upper and lower <b>legform</b> <b>impactors</b> representatives of 4 different vehicle front geometries {{in a wide range of}} impact speeds, angles and locations. This test matrix was based on previous work carried out within the AsPeCSS project. The results obtained show several trends and influences of input variables (impact speed, angle, location, impactor masses, impactor type) on the particular outcomes. In general, impact speed was the most influential parameter. The increase of impact speed resulted in higher HIC, bending moment or force presumably generating a higher injury risk. The work carried out provided the results to enable further development of Injury Risk Curves regarding VRU protection for different body regions. This work provides insight into the variation of injury criteria when also considering different speed and angles which is especially useful for the evaluation of active safety systems (e. g. AEB) ...|$|R
40|$|The current <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> in {{pedestrian}} safety tests uses a steel shaft {{connected to}} metal plates {{to represent the}} femur and tibia. It evaluates leg fracture risk based on tibia acceleration, and knee ligament rupture risk based on knee bending angle and shear displacement. However, the impactor does not generate the tibia deflection that occurs when a vehicle impacts a pedestrian.

40|$|In {{the current}} test {{procedure}} {{proposed by the}} European Enhanced Vehicle-safety Committee (EEVC) /WG 17 for evaluating leg injuries to pedestrians, a <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> with a rigid bony structure is used. The risk of damages to knee ligaments is evaluated with the shearing displacement and the bending angle at the knee joint. A recent study has focused on evaluating biofidelity of the legform. However, {{it was not possible}} to obtain a local deformation at the knee joint from published experiments with Post Mortem Human Subjects (PMHSs). In addition, past PMHS experiments have suggested that the height of a bumper significantly affects the risk of ligamentous damages. In this study, three kinds of finite element models were used in order to investigate the relationship between the bumper height and the shearing displacement / bending angle of the knee; 1) a <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> with a rigid bony structure, 2) a recently developed pedestrian dummy (Polar) with both a flexible tibia and a biofidelic knee joint structure, 3) a human lower limb. By utilizing the human model, a local deformation at the knee joint could be obtained. The model for the <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> and the pedestrian dummy have been validated against experiments with an actual car and in component level, respectively. The human lower limb model has been validated against published PMHS experiments. The result of a parameter study with these models in a range of bumper heights showed that the dynamic response of the dummy model is quite similar to that of the human model. In addition, it was found that the mass of the upper body significantly affects the bending angle of the knee. A geometric analysis of the knee joint was also performed to obtain tensile strains of four principal knee ligaments as a function of both the shearing displacement and the bending angle. The result suggested that the shearing displacement and the bending angle should be considered in combination when developing an injury criteria for knee ligaments...|$|E

40|$|Pedestrian {{protection}} {{is one of}} the main research fields inside the automotive safety and one of the main pillars of innovation in the automotive industry. Data accident shows that each year died 6000 people in Europe as a consequence of a traffic accident. The lower extremities are represented by the lower <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> in the laboratory tests. The lower legform that is being used nowadays is the one of the TRL. The magnitudes that it measures and the biomechanics limits are:- Acceleration; with 150 g as a limit value. - Knee bending angle; angle between tibia and femur, with 15 Âº as a limit value. - Shear displacement; gap between tibia and femur, with +/- 6 mm as a limit value. The main target of this research project is to obtain a simplified model to analyse and to predict the behaviour of the front of the vehicle in the lower legform pedestrian protection. The parametric model has been done thinking into account 2 main aspects:- The possibility to maintain the contact points between the front of the vehicle and the lower <b>legform</b> <b>impactor,</b> basic to determine the dynamics of the impactor. - The possibility to change the geometric configuration of the parts of the front of the vehicle, to see how the influence is when introducing changes in the original configuration.

40|$|Paper Number 07 - 0206 A <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> with biofidelic {{characteristics}} (FlexPLI) {{which is}} being developed by the Japanese Automobile Research Institute (JARI) is being considered as a test tool for legislation within a proposed Global Technical Regulation on pedestrian protection (UNECE, 2006) and therefore being evaluated by the Technical Evaluation Group (TEG) of GRSP. In previous built levels it already showed good test results on real cars as well as under idealised test conditions but also revealed further need for improvement. A research study at the Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) deals with the question on how leg injury risks of modern car fronts can be revealed, reflected and assessed by the FlexPLI and how the impactor can be used and implemented as a legislative instrument for the type approval of cars according to current and future legislations on pedestrian protection. The latest impactor built level (GTÎ±) is being evaluated by a general review and assessment of the certification procedure, the knee joint biofidelity and the currently proposed injury criteria. Furthermore, the usability, robustness and durability as a test tool for legislation is examined and an assessment of leg injuries is made {{by a series of}} tests with the FlexPLI on real cars with modern car front shapes as well as under idealised test conditions.

40|$|Current EuroNCAP test {{specifications}} attempt to predict pedestrian lower limb injury in a lateral impact with a rigid legform test device {{developed by the}} UK 2 Ì† 7 s TRL (Transportation Research Lab). Research shows that the measurements taken from this device (knee bending angle, knee shear, and upper tibia acceleration) do not necessarily correspond to accurate injury prediction. Recent {{research suggests that the}} primary improvement to the current test device would be a flexible legform, or one that has more biofidelity (i. e., simulates actual human lower limb response). The work presented in this paper first reviews current legforms developed for pedestrian impact testing, including the TRL impactor used in EuroNCAP tests, Honda 2 Ì† 7 s POLAR II pedestrian dummy, and JAMA/JARI 2 Ì† 7 s FLEX-PLI <b>legform</b> <b>impactor.</b> Component level testing shows the FLEX-PLI performance to be close to the human lower limb response corridors. However, there are still areas of potential improvement with this design. To address these areas, this research includes the phase 1 development of a new <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> incorporating adjustable ligament pre-load, direct ligament strain measurements, adjustability in knee flexion to account for the gait cycle, tuned composite bone cores that match the force-deflection curves of PMHS testing, and a condyle load plate that measures knee joint compressive forces. Development techniques include solid modeling, computer-aided manufacturing, composite design and analysis, sensor specifications, and data acquisition. In so doing, the injury specifications set by the EEVC will be modified to account for the more accurate injury assessment of the improved device...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An FE {{model of}} a {{pedestrian}} lower <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> has been developed and certied, both statically and dynamically, based on EEVC-WG 17 requirements. The legform is then utilized {{in a series of}} 40 km/hr pedestrian accident analyses to assess the protection level delivered by a typical sedan vehicle. The values of maximum tibia acceleration, maximum knee bending angle, and maximum knee shearing displacement have been extracted for 25 dierent accident congurations and compared with their admissible ranges. It has been shown that tibia acceleration is mainly in uenced by extension of the area transferring the impact load between the legform and the vehicle. However, variations of vehicle front-end structure geometry and stiness in the vertical direction {{have been found to be}} the most decisive parameters in the level of legform knee maximum bending rotation and maximum shearing displacement...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringCar-pedestrian {{collision}} fatalities {{have been}} reported for {{a significant number of}} roadside accidents around the world. Protection of pedestrians is taking on an increasingly significant role to car manufactures in developing new designs. The dynamic responses of the pedestrians in vehicle crashes can better be evaluated by examining the biomechanical responses. In order to reduce the lower extremity injuries in car-pedestrian collisions, it is important to determine the impact forces on the pedestrian and conditions that the car frontal side impacts on the lower extremities of the pedestrian. The Working Group 17 (WG 17) of the European Enhanced Vehiclesafety Committee (EEVC) has developed a legform subsystem impactor and procedure for assessing pedestrian collisions and potential injuries. This study describes a methodology for the evaluation of the <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> kinematics after a collision utilizing finite element (FE) models of the legform and cars, and comparing the simulation results with the ones from a multi-body legform model as well as a 50 th percentile male human pedestrian model responses. Two approaches are carried out in the process. First, the collision strike simulations with the FE model using an FE lower legform is considered and validated against the EVVC/WG 17 regulation criteria. Secondly, the collision strike simulations with a multi-body legform and an ellipsoidal multi-body car model are conducted to compare the responses from the FE model and the multibody model. The results from the impact simulations of FE legform and the multi-body legform are also compared with the ones from a full-size pedestrian model at different speeds. All the FE models of the <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> and the car model are developed and evaluated using the LSDYNA nonlinear FE code, while the multibody legform, car, and full-sized pedestrian models are developed and evaluated in MADYMO. The results from this study demonstrate the differences between the subsystem legform and the full-size pedestrian responses as well as suitability of various FE and multibody models related to pedestrian impact responses...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the biofidelity of LSTC and TRL <b>legform</b> <b>impactor.</b> A finite element model of {{simplified}} front vehicle structure was established. The simulation tests were conducted by using this simplified car model against two different legform impactors and a FE lower extremity, respectively at a speed of 40 km/h. The simulation results from the two legform impactors were compare with that of the FE lower extremity. The compared outputs include tibia acceleration, shear displacement, knee bending angle. The test results show that the tibia acceleration of the impactors and the FE lower extremity are approximately consistent. As to the shear displacement and the knee bending angle, though the output of the impactors are not agreed so well with that of the FE lower extremity, the trend are comparable to some extent. The results of the FE lower extremity are higher than that of the legform impactors. The results of LSTC impactor has a better agreement with that from FE lower extremity...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to investigate the stiffness of the knee joint, in order to provide a basis for developing a biofidelic pedestrian <b>legform</b> <b>impactor.</b> A biofidelic lower limb model was employed to replicate structural responses of the human knee joint by finite element simulations. In the simulation, a single displacement was imposed on the thigh or leg, and constrained six freedoms of the other part. As a result, nonlinear load-displacement data were approximated by a linear regression to determine the stiffness. Considering knee joint kinematics under lateral car-pedestrian impacts, a stiffness matrix was established including lateral bending, lateral shearing and torsion effects that significantly influence pedestrian lower limb injuries. Then, this stiffness matrix was applied in a developed legform model. The structural responses of the legform were obtained by the impact with a family car model. Finally, the legform biofidelity was evaluated by comparing the global kinematics of the pedestrian lower limb...|$|E
40|$|The EEVC WG 17 {{upper leg}} test {{as used in}} Euro NCAP was reviewed. Previous work {{revealed}} shortcomings of the EEVC WG 17 test set-up. Recent published accident data show that injuries to the lower extremities by the bonnet leading edge, not including ground impacts, only accounted for 5 % of all AIS 2 + injuries and 4 % of all AIS 3 + injuries. Previous work and this data indicate a discrepancy in importance of the upper leg test between Euro NCAP and real-life injury frequencies. Suggested <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> threshold values have {{so far not been}} based on human injury risk transferred to impactor values. The implications of the proposed improvements to the test set-up from Snedeker et al. (2005) for Euro NCAP test results have not been assessed. Both the above issues are aimed at in this study. They are important as only with the right targets and evaluation methods, traffic related injuries can be minimized. Human injury threshold values for femur and pelvis impact were derived from applicable and original PMHS data. Data was scaled to a mid-sized male, survival analysis with Weibull fit was performed with exact femur 3 -point bending data, logistic regression with doubly censored pelvis impact data. Legform thresholds were derived using a linear regression between impactor and THUMS values derived form tests conducted by Snedeker et al. (2005). It is assumed that THUMS and upper leg surrogates have a similar response. The implications of the new set-up and thresholds for Euro NCAP test results were assessed for results published 2009 and 2010 using empirical relationships between impact energy, measured force and moment. Using this approach, the resulting thresholds to be used with the legform were determined to be 7. 9 - 9. 0 kN for the pelvis test and 300 - 365 Nm for the femur test. These values correspond to 5 and 20 % fracture risk, respectively. With the currently used set-up and limits, the average score for the upper leg test is 22 % of the maximum score. With the proposed method and limits, the average score calculated is 70 %. With only 30 % missing, the score matches better with the accident frequency of bonnet leading edge induced injuries to lower extremities...|$|E
40|$|In late 70 ', {{mainly in}} the United States and in Australia, {{independent}} research centres had processed several statistical data on accidents between vehicles and pedestrians, taking care, obviously, to pedestrians' injury. That problem in the early 80 ' became also interesting for European research centres. In 1990 a research group of EEVC (European Enhanced Vehicle-Safety Committee) had examined statistical data of past twenty years and scientific research published about this topic, and had presented several documents about "pedestrian test" procedures. In reference papers of period of twenty years (1977 - 97) and in documents of EEVC, the scientists describe a proposed test for lower-leg impact; it {{is represented by the}} impact of a standardised impactor (that simulate the human leg) on car front-part; those documents have been updated in 1994, 1998 and finally in 2002 while Euro-NCAP, since 1998 had used them to realize, in specialized laboratories, tests for giving a rate for car-safety judgement. EEVC wants to introduce those tests for the new homologation program since 2010. A "lighter" version of those tests will be performed on new-cars, also for homologation, using ACEA Protocol, which is easier to per form, since 2005. The most Important Automotive industries had understood the impact of those new regulations about homologation and began to study the problem and particularly how to introduce these new Homologation parameters in their Product development cycles, today based on Virtual Prototyping of the Whole Vehicle and final Physical testing of few physical prototypes. EEVC lower-leg impactor was thought in order to evaluate the injury in several parts of the leg using three parameters: - Deceleration of the higher part of the tibia in order to evaluate the injury on Tibia bone; - Shear displacement in the knee joint in order to evaluate the damage that occurs at the human knee for the displacement of the patella towards the higher part of the Tibia - Maximum bending angle in non-natural way of deformation of the knee (in left or right side) that causes the injury for knee ligaments. Those three parameters are useful to evaluate what happens when a pedestrian, that cross a road orthogonally to the vehicle direction, is rammed by a car, and hits the Bonnet and the bumper by Leg (femur/tibia). Impactor used to evaluate the damage in pedestrian test is made by TRL and is quite similar to the structure of the Human leg: it has a very complicated joint system. In this study we have simulated the <b>Legform</b> <b>Impactor,</b> using FEM processor PamCrash (TM), using the ESI (TM) Kinematic joint formulation. After that work of modelling we have tested the Impactor by the simulation of the Certification Tests, as described in the EEVC and EuroNCAP norms, in order to obtain the same results of the experimental test. The Numeric/Experimental correlation is very good and we've numerically certified our FEM impactor...|$|E
