30|$|When {{a patient}} {{presents}} with a pin site reaction, they {{are encouraged to}} start twice daily pin care for that pin, reduce activity and weight bearing, and start oral antibiotics if these measures fail or if symptoms worsen. If a patient presents with a pin site infection, they are started on oral antibiotics and instructed to start twice daily pin site care for that pin. A reduction of weight-bearing activity in conjunction with elevation of the limb (if swelling is present) is recommended. If the infection does not resolve completely, pin cultures are taken and a second antibiotic is added empirically. Culture-specific antibiotics are then started when the results become available. For persistent infections, radiographs are obtained and evaluated for pin loosening. If half-pin loosening is not clear from the radiographs, the pin is then disconnected from the frame and tested. <b>Loose</b> <b>pins</b> are removed immediately in the office. Persistently infected tensioned wires are also removed in the clinic. When vital pins or wires are removed, the patient is brought {{to the operating room}} for frame modification urgently. At that time, the pin site is debrided and if there is accompanying cellulitis, the patient admitted for IV antibiotics and elevation. Patients who have had deep infections (<b>loose,</b> infected <b>pin</b> with lucencies on X-ray) are monitored for signs of osteomyelitis. Typically, removal of the foreign body (the half pin) is enough to cure the infection. When in doubt, an MRI (after frame removal) is obtained to evaluate the need for repeat debridement. After treatment with the external fixator is complete and at the time of frame removal, all pin sites are debrided. Since HA pins have been used routinely, <b>loose</b> <b>pins</b> are very rare at the time of frame removal and most pins are still fixed securely in the bone.|$|R
30|$|Although {{pin site}} infections are complications, severe {{problems}} may follow that could compromise treatment goals and increase patient morbidity [31, 36, 39]. These include pin loosening (with loss of fixation, loss of alignment, frame instability, and, in rare cases, abandoning external fixator treatment [26, 28]), osteomyelitis, joint or fracture site contamination, and increasing pain which limits patient function. <b>Loose</b> <b>pins</b> and wires, when identified, {{should be removed}} promptly to prevent progression to osteomyelitis and the pins and wires vital to construct integrity need to be replaced. Osteomyelitis may arise from superficial pin site infections in up to 4 Â % of cases and represents the most severe consequence of a superficial infection [36]. Timely, meticulous surgical debridement can prevent this from becoming chronic osteomyelitis.|$|R
40|$|Deep {{and severe}} burns often present with the {{exposure}} of musculoskeletal structures and severe deformities. Skeletal fixation, suspension and/or traction are part of their comprehensive treatment. Several factors put burn patients at risk for osteomyelitis, osteosynthesis material being one of them. In {{order to determine the}} safety of skeletal fixation, we reviewed all pediatric patients treated with pin insertion during the past 10 years. Forty-one severely burned children (61 +/- 3 % TBSA Full thickness burns), had a total of 357 skeletal fixation procedures. Pins were maintained an average of 25. 3 +/- 1. 7 days. Thirteen pins (3. 6 %) were loose before the expected time of removal, two patients (4. 8 %) presented with cellulitis of the pin site and two patients (4. 8 %) presented with osteomyelitis. <b>Loose</b> <b>pins,</b> pin site cellulitis, burn wound infection and sepsis were not associated with ostemyelitis. Skeletal fixation in severely burned patients presents with a low incidence of infectious complications. Its use should be considered in patients affected by severe burns that present with exposed deep structures and for positioning purposes. The exact timing for pin removal in burned patients is still to be defined. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Osteotomy is {{used for}} {{correction}} of the altered load on the gonarthrotic knee joint. It can be performed above or below the knee. Clinical results depend on the correction after bone healing. By tibial closed wedge osteotomy (HTO), the deformity is corrected peroperatively in contrast to tibial hemicallotasis osteotomy (HCO) where the correction is performed after surgery. Comparing the two methods, the precision was better after HCO but the clinical results were similar at follow-up. After one year, the radiographic alignment of the leg was better after HCO, as was {{the stability of the}} osteotomy measured by RSA. In 308 operations, the most common complication after HCO was minor pin-tract infection. It was registered in 157 cases. Pin-tract care and oral antibiotics were sufficient as treatment in most cases. A <b>loose</b> external <b>pin</b> implies a risk for pin-tract infection. Hydroxyapatite-coating (HA) of the pin threads increased the fixation. HA-coating is recommended for use in metaphyseal locations where the risk for pin loosening is higher. 11 complications requiring re-operation were registered after 32 distal femoral osteotomies for lateral gonarthrosis. HCO was studied as treatment for lateral gonarthrosis and advanced medial gonarthrosis. The 2 -year results after 23 operations were similar to those after treatment for early medial gonarthrosis. In a matched study of knee arthroplasty, there was no increased radiostereometric migration of the tibial component after a previous tibial osteotomy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background & Aims: Metaphysical distal radius {{fractures}} {{are common}} fractures account {{for almost half}} of the fractures in Orthopaedic Emergencies. According to different studies, 1 - 6 weeks cast immobilization after distal radius surgery has been recommended. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare outcomes and complications of short-term and long-term immobilization treatment methods. Methods: In a randomized clinical trial, 50 patients with metaphysical distal radius fractures and extra joint or intra joint fractures without comminution referred to the Emergency Unit of Shohada Hospital in Tabriz, Iran who were treated by percutaneous pinning were selected and divided into two groups of immobility for one week (group 1) and immobility for four weeks (group 2). Results: <b>Loosing</b> of <b>pins</b> was not seen in any of the groups. There were no significant differences in intensity of pain, infection at the site of pins and range of motion improvement between the two groups. Most of the patients in group two like group one have gained their ability in three months, but 1. 5 month after the treatment return of motions in the early motion group was significantly faster. Conclusion: According to these findings, there is no difference in final therapeutic and functional outcomes between 1 - and 4 - week post operative immobility. Earlier initiation of movements after one week is not associated with more complications in comparison to late initiation of movements, but patients return to their daily activities earlier.

40|$|In this {{retrospective}} study 29 dogs {{of both sexes}} of several breeds, were evaluated. Complications of external skeletal fixation were common. The most frequent post-surgical complications were chronic pin track drainage or <b>pin</b> <b>loosing</b> (11; 37. 9 %), followed by dry crust at the skin-to-pin interface (5; 17. 1 %). In five cases (17. 1 %) occurred the healing of the fracture without complications. In three dogs (10. 4 %) occurred nonunion and it was used another fixation method. It was observed individual cases of poor limb use (3. 5 %) or breakage of the pin (3. 5 %) or of the acrylic column (3. 5 %). Pin track drainage or loosing {{was related to the}} owners care. The most did not come back to the hospital as was demanded or did not follow the instructions to inspect the apparatus daily. This behaviour contributed to increase the rate of post-surgical complications. The external fixation has the advantage to be less invasive and can be used to treat closed and open fractures, limb deformities, nonunion and infected fractures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Measurement of the bending {{stiffness}} a healing fracture represents a valid {{variable in the}} assessment of fracture healing. However, currently available methods typically have high measurement errors, even for mild pin loosening. Furthermore, these methods cannot provide actual values of {{bending stiffness}}, which precludes comparisons among individual fractures. Thus, even today, little information is available with regards to the fracture healing pattern with respect to actual values of bending stiffness. Our goals were, therefore: to develop a measurement device that would allow accurate and sensitive measurement of bending stiffness, even in the presence of mild pin loosening; to describe the course of healing in individual fractures; and help to evaluate whether the individual pattern of bending stiffness can be predicted at an early stage of healing. Methods A new measurement device has been developed to precisely measure the bending stiffness of the healing fracture by simulating four-point-bending. The system was calibrated on aluminum models and intact tibiae. The influence of pin loosening on measurement error was evaluated. The system was tested at weekly intervals in an animal experiment to determine the actual bending stiffness of the fracture. Transverse fractures were created in the right tibia of twelve sheep, and then stabilized with an external fixator. At ten weeks, bending stiffness of the tibiae were determined in a four-point-bending test device to validate the in-vivo-measurement data. Results In-vivo bending stiffness can be measured accurately and sensitive, even in the early phase of callus healing. Up to a bending stiffness of 10 Nm/degree, measurement error was below 3. 4 % for one <b>pin</b> <b>loose,</b> and below 29. 3 % for four <b>pins</b> <b>loose,</b> respectively. Measurement of stiffness data over time revealed a significant logarithmic increase between the third and seventh weeks, whereby the logarithmic rate of change among sheep was similar, but started from different levels. Comparative measurements showed that early individual changes between the third and fourth weeks {{can be used as a}} predictor of bending stiffness at seven weeks (r = 0. 928) and at ten weeks (r = 0. 710). Conclusion Bending stiffness can be measured precisely, with less error in the case of pin loosening. Prediction of the future healing course of the individual fracture can be assessed by changes from the third to the fourth week, with differences in stiffness levels. Therefore, the initial status of the fracture seems to have a high impact on the individual healing course. </p...|$|R
50|$|On Saturday {{they and}} Wallace rode {{on to the}} bridge, which was of good plain board, well made and jointed, having placed watches to see that none passed from the army. Taking a wright, the most able workman there, he Wallace ordered him to saw the plank in two at the mid streit stretch, so that no-one might walk over it. He then nailed it up quickly with hinges, and dirtied it with clay, to cause it to appear that nothing had been done. The other end he so {{arranged}} that it should lie on three wooden rollers, which were so placed, that when one was out the rest would fall down. The wright, himself, he ordered to sit there underneath, in a cradle, bound on a beam, to <b>loose</b> the <b>pin</b> when Wallace let him know by blowing a horn when the time was come. No one in all the army {{should be allowed to}} blow but he himself.Hugh Cressingham leads on the vanguard with twenty thousand likely men to see. Thirty thousand the Earl of Warren had, but he did then as wisdom did direct, all the first army being sent over before him. Some Scottish men, who well knew this manner of attack, bade Wallace sound, saying there were now enough. He hastened not, however, but steadily observed the advance until he saw Warren's force thickly crowd the bridge. Then from Jop he took the horn and blew loudly, and warned John the Wright, who thereupon struck out the roller with skill; when the pin was out, the rest of it fell down. Now arose an hideous outcry among the people, both horses and men, falling into the water. (...)On foot, and bearing a great sharp spear, Wallace went amongst the thickest of the press. he aimed a stroke at Cressingham in his corslet, which was brightly polished. The sharp head of the spear pierced right through the plates and through his body, stabbing him beyond rescue; thus was that chieftain struck down to death. With the stroke Wallace bore down both man and horse.The English army although ready for battle, lost heart when their chieftain was slain, and many openly began to flee. Yet worthy men abode in the place until ten thousand were slain. Then the remainder fled, not able to abide longer, seeking succour in many directions, some east, some west, and some fled to the north. Seven thousand full at once floated in the Forth, plunged into the deep and drowned without mercy; none were left alive of all that fell army.|$|R
