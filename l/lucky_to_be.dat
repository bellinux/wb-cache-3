5|$|It {{was finally}} {{accepted}} by BBC North in 1986, {{a result of}} a spare budget being assigned for a second series of Happy Families that would never arise, and producer Paul Jackson's insistence that Red Dwarf should be filmed instead. The show was <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> remounted after an electricians' strike partway through rehearsals in early 1987 shut the entire production down (the title sequence was filmed in January 1987). The filming was rescheduled for September, and the pilot episode finally made it onto television screens on 15 February 1988.|$|E
5|$|The French column surrenderd on {{the promise}} that the {{officers}} would not be stripped, but they all remained as prisoners of war and surrendered their weapons and money to the Catalans. Juigné, with 136 other wounded soldiers and a German captain, remained in Olot to receive medical treatment, but he died shortly after. French losses amounted to 251 or 260 men killed–32 of them officers– and 826 prisoners, as opposed to 7 men killed and 5 wounded on the miquelets side. The figures are well known, as the French intendant of Girona, René Desgrigny, {{wrote a letter to}} Olot's aldermen asking for the number and rank of the prisoners to exchange them when possible. In this letter, Desgrigny noted that Monsieur Juigné was <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dead, as the defeat would probably have cost him dearly. The 690 unscathed French prisoners were brought first to Vic and later to Barcelona, where they arrived on 15 March. Their entrance was seen by a large crowd and the Spanish Viceroy, the Marquis of Gastañaga.|$|E

25|$|The Southland {{match at}} Invercargill on 21 June {{was the last}} before the first Test. Lions coach Clive Woodward {{announced}} that no players in the night's line-up would play in the Test. In the first 15 minutes, the Lions looked formidable as they took an early 10–0 lead over the Stags, keyed by a Gavin Henson try. However, they became disjointed and by half-time had turned over the ball 14 times and were considered <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ahead 10–3 at the break.|$|E

He also conceded 110 in 19 overs against Pakistan in two ODIs at Perth and Sydney. Nevertheless, he was picked against the Australians for the fourth Test at Adelaide.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand were {{defeated}} only {{twice in the}} tournament, both times by Pakistan, in their final group match and in the semi-final.

25|$|There {{are several}} legends {{as to the}} origin of this custom. Two popular {{explanations}} for the South’s association with peas and good luck dates back to the American Civil War. The first is associated with General William T. Sherman’s march of the Union Army to the sea, during which they pillaged the Confederates' food supplies. Stories say peas and salted pork were said to have been left untouched, because of the belief that they were animal food unfit for human consumption. Southerners considered themselves <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left with some supplies to help them survive the winter, and black-eyed peas evolved into a representation of good luck. In another Southern tradition, black-eyed peas was a symbol of emancipation for African-Americans who had previously been enslaved, and who after the Civil War were officially freed on New Years Day. Other Southern American traditions point to Jews of Ashkenazi and Sephardic ancestry in Southern cities and plantations.|$|E

Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle praised the album saying [...] "every song on Celebration defines a moment in time, a radio sing-along, a twirl under the glitterball.

500|$|The 1965 season {{brought more}} {{obstacles}} for Koufax. On March 31, {{the morning after}} pitching a complete spring training game, Koufax awoke to find that his entire left arm was black and blue from hemorrhaging. Koufax returned to Los Angeles to consult with Kerlan, who advised Koufax {{that he would be}} <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to pitch once a week. Kerlan also told Koufax that he would eventually lose full use of his arm. Koufax agreed not to throw at all between games—a resolution that lasted only one start. To get himself through the games he pitched in, Koufax resorted to Empirin with codeine for the pain, which he took every night and sometimes during the fifth inning. He also took Butazolidin for inflammation, applied capsaicin-based Capsolin ointment (called [...] "atomic balm" [...] by baseball players) before each game, and soaked his arm in a tub of ice afterwards.|$|E

He pressured the goalkeeper into missing a cross which dropped for Dejan Stanković to set up Mateja Kežman's equaliser, and 12 minutes later, his pass left Kežman clear on goal but he mis-hit what might have been a winning shot. The result left Serbia-Montenegro top of the group, and they confirmed their qualification at home to Bosnia and Herzegovina when Žigić's assist gave Kežman a tap-in for the only goal of the game.|$|E

[...] Despite criticisms from PewDiePie and other gamers alike, Nintendo experienced more requests from YouTube creators than expected, causing an extension on the 72-hour wait time for video approval through the program. Additionally, PewDiePie, stated, [...] "I'll still play Nintendo games that I want to play on my channel as usual. I'm <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a situation where losing ad revenue on a few videos won't matter. However, many people on YouTube are not in that situation."
