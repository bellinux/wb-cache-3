5|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a marked {{increase}} in passengers travelling to and from Parson Street. In the 2002/03 financial year, less than 4,000 passengers used the station; and in 2005, only six eastbound and eight westbound trains called at Parson Street each day, with 14,293 passengers using the station during the 2005/06 financial year. Since then, service <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> increased to 21 westbound trains and 18 eastbound per weekday, and passenger <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> more than quadrupled, to 102,654 in 2013/14.|$|E
50|$|The Patrick McGuinness Three-Decker is a {{historic}} triple decker at 25 Suffield Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. It was built c. 1908, and is a rare well-preserved example of a double triple-decker (housing six units) with Colonial Revival styling. The building has a central recessed porch area where each <b>level</b> <b>has</b> a slightly different treatment: the first <b>level</b> <b>has</b> full-length turned columns, the second <b>level</b> <b>has</b> half-height columns above a shingled balustrade, and the third <b>level</b> <b>has</b> arch-forming brackets resting on short piers. The bays flanking the porch area are rounded.|$|R
50|$|Oklahoma {{recognized}} an EMT-Cardiac level until recently. However, that <b>level</b> <b>has</b> been {{phased out}} and providers in Oklahoma at the EMT-Cardiac <b>level</b> <b>have</b> since been trained and certified to the paramedic level or downgraded to EMT-I.|$|R

Overall, things are beginning to move along nicely.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{management}} of strategy, design can be managed on three levels: strategic (corporate level or enterprise wide), tactical (business level or individual business units), and operational (individual project level). These three <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> been termed differently by various authors over the last 50 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} several two-player modes. Players may race on foot through new (or altered) <b>levels,</b> <b>have</b> shoot-'em-up battles in mechs, hunt for Master Emerald shards or race in go-karts. A few {{characters}} are playable in these modes, {{but not in}} the main game; Tikal and Chaos from the original Sonic Adventure are playable in the treasure-hunting game, as are Amy Rose and Metal Sonic in the foot-racing levels.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 1,486,929,267 {{vehicles}} {{have used the}} crossing as of 31 March 2014. The highest recorded daily usage was 181,990 vehicles on 23 July 2004; since then traffic <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> decreased. From April 2013 to March 2014, 49,645,356 vehicles used the crossing: a daily average of 136,015 vehicles. The total income for the financial year ended 31 March 2012 was £72,147,091, while the corresponding figure for the following financial year was £80,331,662. A 2016 report by Highways England suggested the crossing is used around 50 million times a year.|$|E
5|$|Before the Industrial Revolution, Carmarthen {{used to be}} {{the most}} populous town in Wales. In 1931, the county's {{population}} was 171,445 and in 1951, 164,800. At the census in 2011, Carmarthenshire had a population of 183,777. Population <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> thus dipped and then increased again over the course of eighty years.

5|$|During a {{national}} recession from 2001 to 2003, the city lost 28,000 jobs. In response, a development initiative, Vision 2025, promised to incite {{economic growth and}} recreate lost jobs. Projects spurred by the initiative promised urban revitalization, infrastructure improvement, tourism development, riverfront retail development, and further diversification of the economy. As of 2007, employment <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> surpassed pre-recession heights and the city is in a significant economic development and investment surge. This economic improvement is also seen in Tulsa's housing trends which show an average of a 6% increase in rent in 2010. Since 2006, more than 28,000 jobs {{have been added to}} the city. The unemployment rate of Tulsa in August 2014 was 4.5%.|$|E
5|$|Groundwater <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> been dropping, {{to varying}} degrees, {{in many areas}} of the city, due in part to an {{increase}} in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground. A city agency, the Boston Groundwater Trust, coordinates monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells. However, Boston's drinking water supply, from the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs to the west, is one of the very few in the country so pure as to satisfy federal water quality standards without filtration.|$|E
5|$|Heroes {{will appear}} {{at various points}} and times, {{sometimes}} accompanied by a tunneller dwarf, who, like imps, are able to dig. The dungeon can be protected from being breached by having the imps fortify the walls. Heroes include giants, wizards, and samurai warriors. Most <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> a 'Lord of the Land', a heavily armoured knight, who must be defeated. In the final level, the Avatar (resembling the Avatar from Ultima VIII), the most powerful hero, appears as the Lord of the Land, and is resurrected after being defeated. He must be defeated again when he reappears with a large army.|$|E

5|$|Much {{progress}} has been made in the power scaling lasers and amplifiers produced with ytterbium (Yb) doped optical fibers. Power <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> increased from the 1kW regimes due to the advancements in components as well as the Yb-doped fibers. Fabrication of Low NA, Large Mode Area fibers enable achievement of near perfect beam qualities (M2<1.1) at power levels of 1.5 kW to greater than 2 kW at ~1064 nm in a broadband configuration. Ytterbium-doped LMA fibers also have the advantages of a larger mode field diameter, which negates the impacts of nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering and stimulated Raman scattering, which limit the achievement of higher power levels, and provide a distinct advantage over single mode ytterbium-doped fibers.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or {{to aid in}} the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30mg/l, which equals 200 µmol/L. Levels of 30–300mg/L (200–2000 µmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> ranged from 50–400mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated colorimetric techniques, gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century saw an {{increase}} in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal. Beginning in the 1920s, lead was added to gasoline to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust persists today in soil and dust in buildings. Blood lead levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when leaded gasoline began to be phased out. In those countries that have banned lead in solder for food and drink cans and have banned leaded gasoline additives, blood lead <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> fallen sharply since the mid-1980s.|$|E

5|$|The 610 Office's {{intelligence}} collection efforts are bolstered through he cultivation of paid civilian informants. 610 Offices at local <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> {{been found to}} offer substantial monetary rewards {{for information leading to}} the capture of Falun Gong practitioners, and 24-hour hotlines have been created for civilians to report on Falun Gong-related activity. In some locales, 'responsibility measures' are enacted whereby workplaces, schools, neighborhood committees and families are held accountable for monitoring and reporting on Falun Gong practitioners within their ranks.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Levels</b> <b>have</b> few wooded areas, just {{occasional}} willow trees. The {{landscape is}} dominated by grassland, mostly used as pasture for dairy farming with approximately 70per cent of the area being grassland and 30per cent arable. From January until May, the River Parrett provides a source of European eels (Anguilla anguilla) and young elvers, which are caught by hand netting as {{this is the only}} legal means of catching them. A series of eel passes have been built on the Parrett at the King's Sedgemoor Drain to help this endangered species; cameras have shown 10,000 eels migrating upstream in a single night. The 2003 BBC Radio 4 play Glass Eels by Nell Leyshon was set on the Parrett.|$|E
5|$|The fort is {{designed}} as a defensible battery, rather than a defensive strongpoint. The faces of the fort join to form a half-moon shape or lunette. The guns' primary role was to defend Port Adelaide and the Semaphore anchorage rather than the fort itself, and the design reflects this. It {{was intended to be}} supported by field artillery, cavalry and infantry for self-defence and to repel landings. While the fort retains its original form, the ditch and glacis (embankment) have been modified and are largely non-existent in some areas. Ground <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> been changed to accommodate paths and a caravan park, and the original western fence no longer exists.|$|E
