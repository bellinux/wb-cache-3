40|$|Divergence {{structures}} {{associated with}} the spectrum of precipitating systems in the subtropics and midlatitudes are not well documented. A mesoscale model (MM 5) is employed to quantify the relative importance different baroclinic environments have on divergence profiles for common storm types in southeast Texas, a subtropical region. Divergence profiles averaged over a 100 x 100 nested grid with 3 -km grid spacing are calculated from the model-derived wind fields for each storm. The divergence profiles simulated for selected storms {{are consistent with those}} calculated from an S-band radar using the velocity-azimuth display (VAD) technique. Divergence profiles from well-modeled storms vary in magnitude and structure across the spectrum of baroclinicities and storm types common in southeast Texas. Barotropic storms more characteristic of the Tropics generate the most elevated divergence (and thus diabatic heating) structures with the largest magnitudes. As the degree of baroclinicity increases, stratiform area fractions increase while the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-divergence</b> (LNDs) decrease. However, some weakly baroclinic storms contain stratiform area fractions and divergence profiles with magnitudes and LNDs that are similar to barotropic storms, despite having lower tropopause heights and less deep convection. Additional convection forms after the passage of some of the modeled barotropic and weakly baroclinic storms that contain elevated divergence signatures, circumstantially suggesting that heating at upper-levels may cause diabatic feedbacks that help drive regions of persistent convection in the subtropics. Applying a two-dimensional stratiform-convective separation algorithm to MM 5 reflectivity data generates realistic stratiform and convective divergence signals. Stratiform regions in barotropic storms contain thicker, more elevated mid-level convergence structures with larger magnitudes than strongly baroclinic storms, while weakly baroclinic storms have LNDs that fall somewhere in between with magnitudes similar to barotropic storms. Divergence profiles within convective regions typically become more elevated as baroclinicity decreases, although variations in magnitude are less coherent. These simulations suggest that MM 5 adequately captures mass field perturbations within convective and stratiform regions, the latter of which produces diabatic feedbacks capable of generating additional convection. As a result, future research determining the climatological dynamic response caused by divergence profiles in MM 5 may be feasible...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{establishes a}} precipitation climatology for common storm types and structures in southeast Texas, investigating diurnal, seasonal, and interannual rainfall variations {{in addition to}} climatological differences in raindrop size distributions and storm divergence profiles. Divergence profiles observed by an S-band, Doppler radar are compared to ensemble simulations of ten precipitating systems occurring in warm season, weakly baroclinic, and strongly baroclinic environments. Eight triply-nested mesoscale model simulations are conducted for each case using single- and double- moment microphysics with four convective treatments (i. e., two convective parameterizations and explicit vs. parameterized convection at 9 km). Observed and simulated radar reflectivities are objectively separated into convective, stratiform, and non-precipitating anvil columns and comparisons are made between ensemble mean echo coverages and <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-divergence</b> (LNDs). In both the model and observations, storms occurring in less baroclinic environments have more convective rain area, less stratiform rain area, and more elevated divergence profiles. The model and observations agree best for well-organized, leading-line trailing stratiform systems. Excessive convective rain area and elevated LNDs are simulated for several less organized cases. Simulations parameterizing convection on the intermediate grid produced less elevated divergence profiles with smaller magnitudes compared to their explicit counterparts. In one warm season case, double-moment microphysics generated lower LNDs associated with variations in convective intensity and depth, detraining less ice to anvil and stratiform regions at midlevels relative to a single-moment scheme. Similarly, mesoscale convective vortex simulations employing an ensemble-based versus a single-closure convective parameterization produced the least elevated heating structures (closer to observed) resulting in the weakest midlevel vortices. Finally, this dissertation is unique in {{that some of the}} data collection and a portion of the analysis involved 95 undergraduates in a five-year research and education program, the Student Operational ADRAD Project (SOAP). In addition to documenting the program's structure and implementation, student-reported experiences, confidence, and interest in performing SOAP tasks are also analyzed. Students participating in SOAP for multiple years were significantly more confident in performing SOAP tasks, more likely to obtain science or meteorology-related employment upon graduation, and more likely to matriculate to graduate programs, suggesting programs like SOAP have a strong influence on students' career outcomes and self-efficacy...|$|R

40|$|Two {{case studies}} {{were used to}} test the Sutcliffe-Peterssen {{development}} theory for both cyclonic and anticyclonic development over the eastern United States. Each term was examined to determine when and where it made a significant contribution to the development process. Results indicate the advection of vorticity at the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-divergence</b> exerts the dominant influence for initial cyclone development, and that the thermal terms (advection of thickness, stability, and diabatic influence) become important after development has begun. Anticyclonic development, however, depends primarily on the stability term throughout the life cycle of the anticyclone. Simple procedures for forecasting the development and movement of cyclones and anticyclones are listed. These rules indicate that routine National Meteorological Center analyses may be used to locate areas where the positive advection of 500 -mb vorticity, indicative of cyclonic development, coincides with regions of severe weather activity. The development of anticyclones also is predicted easily. Regions of increasing stability, indicating anticyclonic development, may be located by use of National Meteorological Center radar summaries and analyses for 1000 - 500 -mb thickness.

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a {{sequence}} of numerical weather prediction efforts utilizing the special observations from the GARP Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE). These observations, along with those available from the World Weather Watch, provide a unique opportunity to carry out numerical weather prediction (NWP) studies over portions of West Africa and the eastern Atlantic ocean utilizing high resolution limited area models. The present study reports on the results of 34 short-range numerical weather prediction experiments, with two simple models, designed to study the westward propagation of African waves. In the time frame of 24 to 48 hours, predictions at 700 mb (the level of maximum amplitude of these waves, and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-divergence)</b> show extremely promising results. These results are comparable to fine-mesh predictions in higher latitudes. Errors in phase speed and vector root mean square (RMS) wind errors are summarized for the third phase of GATE. A second part of this study deals with the problem of specification of the West African squall line with respect to the position of the predicted trough line of the African wave. A body of recent literature provides useful obser-vational statistics relating the position of African waves, certain geographical regions, the time of day and the formation of line squall systems. These studies also provide information on the relative speeds of westward motion of the squall line and the wave trough. The decay of the squall lines during their westward propagation away from the trough is also 8 part of these observational statistics. Based on these observations, an empirical set of selection rules may be defined to specify the squall lines with respect to the predicted motion field. Successful results were obtained in the time frame of 24 to 48 hours for these experiments, the results of which are summarized below. 1...|$|E
