5|$|The maximum {{lifespan}} of bats is three-and-a-half {{times larger}} than other mammals of a similar size. Five species have been recorded living over 30 years in the wild: the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), Brandt's bat (Myotis brandti), the <b>lesser</b> <b>mouse-eared</b> <b>bat</b> (Myotis blythii) and the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). One hypothesis as to why bats can live so long is because they slow down their metabolic rate while hibernating, being consistent with the rate-of-living theory; bats that hibernate, on average, have a longer lifespan than bats that do not. Another hypothesis is that flying has reduced their mortality rate, which would also be true for birds and gliding mammals. Bat species which give birth to multiple pups generally have a shorter lifespan than species that give birth to only a single pup. Cave-roosting species may have a longer lifespan than non-roosting species because of the decreased predation in caves. The oldest recorded bat is a 41-year-old male Brandt's bat.|$|E

There are no endemic mammal orders in the region.There live about 25 species insectivores in Europe (European hedgehog, southern white-breasted hedgehog, common shrew, Eurasian pygmy shrew, European mole, blind mole, Eurasian water shrew). Of the 35 European bats, the most widespread are the greater horseshoe bat, lesser horseshoe bat, Mediterranean horseshoe bat, greater mouse-eared bat, <b>lesser</b> <b>mouse-eared</b> <b>bat,</b> Bechstein's bat, Natterer's bat, whiskered bat, Daubenton's bat, brown long-eared bat, grey long-eared bat, barbastelle, serotine bat, parti-coloured bat, common pipistrelle, Nathusius' pipistrelle, lesser noctule and common noctule.The rodents include several voles (common vole, field vole, European pine vole etc.), harvest mice, hazel dormouse, garden dormouse, edible dormouse, red squirrel, striped field mouse, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, black rat, brown rat, house mouse, water vole, Cricetus. The European beaver was hunted almost to extinction, but is now being re-introduced throughout Europe. The three European lagomorphs are the European rabbit, mountain hare and European hare.Widespread and locally common ungulates are boar, moose, roe deer, red deer, reindeer, wisent, chamois and argali.Today the larger carnivores (wolves and bears) are endangered. The brown bear lives primarily in the Balkan peninsula, Scandinavia and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.). In addition, wolverine is found in the Scandinavian Mountains and polar bears may be found on Svalbard. The Eurasian wolf, the second largest predator in Europe after the bear, can be found primarily in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, with various packs in pockets of Western Europe (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.). The Italian wolf is a distinct sub-species of wolf found in the Italian Peninsula, especially amongst the Apennines. Other important European carnivores are Eurasian lynx, Iberian lynx (a distinct, yet critically endangered species), European wild cat, foxes (especially the red fox), European jackal, stoat, Eurasian otter, European mink, Eurasian badger and different species of martens. The only primate species (besides humans) is the re-introduced Barbary macaque; moreover, in prehistory this primate was more widely distributed in southern Europe.|$|E

Phylogenetic analysis based on both nucleotide and amino acid sequences showed that the Aravan virus was more closely related to genotypes 4, 5, and [...] to a lesser extent [...] 6, which circulates among insectivorus bats in Europe and Africa.

40|$|Two sympatrically {{occurring}} bat species, {{the greater}} mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis (Borkhausen, 1797)) and the <b>lesser</b> <b>mouse-eared</b> <b>bat</b> (Myotis blythii (Tomes, 1857)) (Chiroptera, Vespertillionidae), share numerous similarities in morphology, roosting behaviour, and echolocation {{and are often}} difficult to distinguish. However, despite these similarities, their foraging behaviour is noticeably different. Our aim {{was to examine the}} extent to which these different foraging strategies reflect morphological adaptation. We assessed whether the morphology of the wing, body, and tail differed between M. myotis and M. blythii. In addition, in a laboratory experiment involving an obstacle course, we compared differences in manoeuvrability by relating them to our morphological measurements. The two species differed in their overall size, wing-tip shape, and tail-to-body length ratio. The generally smaller sized M. blythii performed better in the obstacle course and was therefore considered to be more manoeuvrable. Although differences in wing-tip shape were observed, we found the most important characteristic affecting manoeuvrability in both species to be the tail-to-body length ratio. Additionally, when we compared two bats with injured wing membranes with unharmed bats of the same species, we found no difference in manoeuvrability, even when the wing shape was asymmetric. We therefore postulate that morphometric differences between the two species in their overall size and, more importantly, in their tail-to-body length ratio are the main physical characteristics providing proof of adaptation to different foraging and feeding strategies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{past three}} decades have {{witnessed}} the development of molecular tools, resulting in the successful integration of genetic methods into studies of wildlife populations. Genomic DNA {{can be obtained from}} a variety of sources including blood or tissues, but also sources which do not necessarily depend on handling or observing animals, like feces, urine, hair, or shed skin. These non-invasive samples can then be used to identify individuals, gender, and species. Genetic data can also be used to assess mating systems, hybridization, gene flow, and effective population size. Conservation biology can benefit of genetic data to define management units and to provide insights into demographic patterns. We describe some applications of genetic data in the study of European bat populations, based exclusively on non-invasive samplings. The populations of many European bat species experienced a dramatic decline in the latter half of the twentieth century, and most of them are currently considered to be vulnerable or endangered species. Many aspects of bat ecology are still unknown, and genetic data provide a powerful tool, especially regarding difficulties to catch and/or observe individuals. Based on bat feces, we investigated population genetics, effective population size and parasite prevalence in the lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros). Combined with ecotoxicological data, results provided important insights on the current exposure of this bat species to several disruptors that may have contributed to its former decline. A similar sampling strategy was applied to study hybridization between two sibling cryptic bat species: the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis) and the <b>lesser</b> <b>mouse-eared</b> <b>bat</b> (M. blythii). These two species often form large mixed-species groups in maternity roosts, where visual counting is impossible because the two species are morphologically almost identical. Genotyping analysis and molecular sexing were used to highlight hybridization cases between the two bat species and to assess the composition of a mixed-species group. Non-invasive sampling and molecular methods were also used in archeological samples to separate DNA mixtures and identify species present at each stratum of guano cores collected in bat roosts. Finally, we present preliminary tests realized on the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti) feces samples collected in Yunnan (China). We discuss how genetic data could help future research on the ecology and conservation of the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey and other species...|$|E
