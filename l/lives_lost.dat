Beppu's family was safe, and he chose to continue in the race.|$|E
5|$|Considerable {{effort is}} put into {{training}} and education by the Institution, particularly for young people; more than 6,000 children a week are spoken to by education volunteers about sea and beach safety, and over 800 children a week receive training.

5|$|With {{the final}} attack upon eastern Kobe in June 1945, the United States command {{determined}} that Kobe {{had been destroyed}} {{to the extent that}} further attacks upon the city were not required. By the end of the war, Kobe had suffered more than 8,000 deaths due to the air raids. Hyogo suffered the highest toll in terms of both <b>lives</b> <b>lost</b> and buildings destroyed.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the trial, {{questions}} were raised about the fairness and legality of the court-martial proceedings. Owing to public pressure, the United States Navy reconvened the courts-martial board in 1945; the court affirmed the guilt of the convicted men. Widespread publicity surrounding the case {{turned it into a}} cause célèbre among certain Americans; it and other race-related Navy protests of 1944–45 led the Navy to change its practices and initiate the desegregation of its forces beginning in February 1946. In 1994, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial was dedicated to the <b>lives</b> <b>lost</b> in the disaster.|$|E

5|$|Well-executed {{evacuations}} and warnings {{limited the}} death toll to six, while damage amounted to $305.8million (1998USD, $409.8million 2009USD). In addition to the six human <b>lives</b> <b>lost,</b> 497 heads of cattle and 21,387 chickens were killed. All six human deaths were indirectly related to Georges; the first death occurred when an 61-year-old woman stepped on a downed wire and was electrocuted; the second occurred when a 56-year-old man drove over another downed wire on his motorcycle and was electrocuted.|$|E
5|$|While the {{hurricane}} was {{moving through the}} Bahamas, the Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from Miami to Titusville, later upgrading to a hurricane warning from Miami to Daytona Beach. The agency advised residents to take precautions for {{the hurricane}}, citing the potential for strong winds and waves. Hurricane warnings were also posted for the west coast from Punta Rassa to Apalachicola, and after the storm recurved, hurricane warnings were extended along the east coast to Jacksonville. Because of well-issued hurricane warnings, residents were prepared for the storm, {{and the number of}} <b>lives</b> <b>lost</b> in the coastal Palm Beach area was only 26.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after George's {{accession}} in Hanover, the War of the Spanish Succession broke out. At {{issue was}} the right of Philip, the grandson of King Louis XIV of France, to succeed to the Spanish throne {{under the terms of}} King Charles II of Spain's will. The Holy Roman Empire, the United Dutch Provinces, England, Hanover and many other German states opposed Philip's right to succeed because they feared that the French House of Bourbon would become too powerful if it also controlled Spain. As part of the war effort, George invaded his neighbouring state, Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, which was pro-French, writing out some of the battle orders himself. The invasion succeeded with few <b>lives</b> <b>lost.</b> As a reward, the prior Hanoverian annexation of the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg by George's uncle was recognised by the British and Dutch.|$|E

25|$|February 1893, a {{sequence}} of flood peaks (8.35 metres and 8.09 metres) over two weeks saw the highest recorded flood level in the Brisbane central business district. Seven <b>lives</b> were <b>lost</b> in the Eclipse Colliery at North Ipswich {{as a direct result}} of the flooding. Several other <b>lives</b> were <b>lost</b> to drownings.|$|R
5|$|The U.S. Civil War greatly {{affected}} Georgetown as 1,141students {{and alumni}} enlisted in one army or the other, and the Union Army commandeered university buildings. By {{the time of}} President Abraham Lincoln's May 1861 visit to campus, 1,400troops were living in temporary quarters there. Due {{to the number of}} <b>lives</b> <b>lost</b> in the war, enrollment levels remained low until well after the war. Only seven students graduated in 1869, down from over 300 in the previous decade. When the Georgetown College Boat Club was founded in 1876, the school's rowing team, it adopted blue, used for Union uniforms, and gray, used for Confederate uniforms, as its colors to signify the peaceful unity among students. Subsequently, the school adopted these as its official colors.|$|E
5|$|For {{those who}} were not injured or killed {{outright}} by moving objects, there was little time to reach safety, especially for the men who were manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies in the hold. The companionways that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of <b>lives</b> <b>lost</b> was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the midsection of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed to get up from below deck were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the crew}} of Ogdensburg {{realized}} that Atlantic was in trouble, either because Ogdensburg Captain Richardson reached that conclusion after examining the damage to his ship, or because {{the crew of}} Ogdensburg, after stopping their ship to check for damage, heard screams coming from the sinking Atlantic. Ogdensburg turned around and found the half-sunk Atlantic ten minutes later; her crew took survivors off Atlantic stern and rescued others from the water. Shortly after Ogdensburg took the last survivors off of the deck of Atlantic, Atlantic sank completely. The ship did not carry detailed passenger lists, but estimates range from at least 130 <b>lives</b> <b>lost</b> up to 300 <b>lives</b> <b>lost,</b> with an estimated death toll of 250 being common.|$|E
