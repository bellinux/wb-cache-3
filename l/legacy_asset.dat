50|$|The problem {{came with}} the {{bursting}} of the housing bubble in 2007, which generated losses for investors and banks. Losses were compounded by the lax underwriting standards {{that had been used}} by some lenders and by the proliferation of the complex securitization instruments, some of whose risks were not fully understood. The resulting need by investors and banks to reduce risk triggered a wide-scale deleveraging in these markets and led to fire sales. As prices declined, many traditional investors exited these markets, causing declines in market liquidity. As a result, a negative cycle developed where declining asset prices have triggered further deleveraging, which has in turn led to further price declines. The excessive discounts embedded in some <b>legacy</b> <b>asset</b> prices are now straining the capital of U.S. financial institutions, limiting their ability to lend and increasing the cost of credit throughout the financial system. The lack of clarity about the value of these legacy assets also made it difficult for some financial institutions to raise new private capital on their own.|$|E
40|$|As {{illustrated}} by liquidity support, equity injections and asset repurchases in financial crises and by IMF credit lines to countries, authorities often intervene {{in order to}} revive markets that have dried up or to create new ones. In such situations, agents participate only if they receive from the governmental scheme {{more than in the}} marketplace, while the market outcome depends on who joins the scheme. The paper provides a first analysis of market jumpstarting and its two-way interaction between mechanism design and participation constraints. In the model, sellers in need of cash have private information about the value of their <b>legacy</b> <b>asset.</b> The absence of buyer confidence forces authorities to intervene to jump-start the market. We characterize the optimal intervention, and draw two main implications. First, the government should clean up the market, through buybacks of the weakest assets and then through some equity injections, and leave the agents with the strongest legacy assets to the market. In particular, authorities should not substitute fully for the market, even when they have no comparative disadvantage in acquiring assets or shares thereof. Second, the government creates its own competition by cleaning up the market from its most toxic pieces. At the optimal intervention the government always strictly overpays for the <b>legacy</b> <b>asset.</b> Yet, and unlike what would be suggested by Coasian profit evasion, the existence of a later market imposes no welfare cost. While it is cast in a public intervention context, the analysis of mechanismdependent reservation utilities also admits important private sector applications...|$|E
40|$|PRELIMINARY VERSION Abstract: Using loan level data, we {{investigate}} the lending {{behavior of a}} large subprime mortgage issuer prior to its bankruptcy {{in the beginning of}} 2007. In 2004, this firm suddenly started to massively issue new loans contracts that featured deferred amortization ("interest-‐ only loans") to high income and high FICO households. We document that these loans were not only riskier, but also that their returns were more sensitive to real estate prices than standard contracts. Implicitly, this lender dramatically increased its exposure to its own <b>legacy</b> <b>asset,</b> which is what a standard model of portfolio selection in distress would predict. We provide additional evidence on New Century’s lending behavior, which are consistent with a risk shifting strategy. Finally, we are able to tie this sudden change in behavior to the sharp monetary policy tightening implemented by the Fed in the spring of 2004. Our findings shed new light on the relationship between monetary policy and risk taking by financial institution...|$|E

40|$|As {{companies}} are increasingly relying on information technologies (IT) {{to help maintain}} their existing and develop new competitive advantages, investing effectively in IT {{is becoming more and}} more important. One of the biggest challenges facing an enterprise IT organization is how to select a project portfolio that is best aligned with the business strategies and to deliver highest value using limited IT resources. In this research paper, I examined in detail a recently proposed IT governance framework, designed a System Dynamics model based on this framework, and developed a simulation application to investigate constructs, relationships and scenarios suggested by the framework. My research identified and examined several levers through which IT managers can achieve better alignment with business goals and more efficient use of IT resources. I examined alternative IT governance regimes (combinations of rules and policies for selecting among opportunities and retaining existing systems) in terms of their effects on efficiency, feature satisfaction, and cost of the resulting <b>legacy</b> <b>asset</b> base. By choosing the right combination of relatively straightforward selection and retention policies, IT managers can steer their legacy assets toward a desired efficiency or satisfaction goal in concert with company strategies. by Bin Zhou.

" After the events of September 11, 2001, the Coast Guard's deepwater missions expanded to include {{a greater emphasis on}} ports, waterways, and coastal security. These heightened responsibilities required changes to the Deepwater implementation plan to provide the assets with greater operational capabilities. To address these needs, in 2002, the Coast Guard began a multiyear acquisition program to replace or modernize its deepwater assets that is currently estimated to cost $ 19 to $ 24 billion. More recently, it began studying options for replacing or modernizing the assets more rapidly in an effort to avoid some of the costs that might be involved in keeping aging assets running for longer periods. This report addresses three questions related to this effort: (1) How has the condition of the Coast Guard's deepwater <b>legacy</b> <b>assets</b> changed during fiscal years 2000 through 2004 ?

40|$|The {{agreement}} {{to establish a}} Single Supervisory Mechanism in Europe is a major step towards a Banking Union, consisting of centralized powers for the supervision of banks, the restructuring and resolution of distressed banks, and a common deposit insurance system. In this paper, we argue that the Banking Union is a necessary complement to the common currency and the Internal Market for capital. However, due care {{needs to be taken}} that steps towards a Banking Union are taken in the right sequence and that liability and control remain at the same level throughout. The following elements are important. First, establishing a Single Supervisory Mechanism under the roof of the ECB and {{within the framework of the}} current EU treaties does not ensure a sufficient degree of independence of supervision and monetary policy. Second, a European institution for the restructuring and resolution of banks should be established and equipped with sufficient powers. Third, a fiscal backstop for bank restructuring is needed. The ESM can play a role but additional fiscal burden sharing agreements are needed. Direct recapitalization of banks through the ESM should not be possible until <b>legacy</b> <b>assets</b> on banks' balance sheets have been cleaned up. Fourth, introducing European-wide deposit insurance in the current situation would entail the mutualisation of <b>legacy</b> <b>assets,</b> thus contributing to moral hazard...|$|R
