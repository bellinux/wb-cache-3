40|$|ABSTRACT: The primary {{advantage}} of a PV concentrator is that concentrating light allows {{a significant reduction in}} the area of solar cell coverage, the main cost driver in a flat plate system. PV systems, whether flat plate or concentrating, normally have groups of solar cells connected in series in order to increase voltage and limit current. However, low illumination on a single cell proportionally reduces its current, and hence affects the performance of all other cells in series. Ideally, a reflective PV concentrator system will have high concentration, a uniform flux distribution, and low cost. However, it is difficult to obtain these three conditions simultaneously, as cost tends to increase with better mirror quality, improved tracking accuracy, and the use of secondary flux modifiers. <b>Linear</b> <b>concentrators</b> have the {{advantage of}} simpler and cheaper tracking and support structures than dishes; however, achieving a consistent flux profile on every cell along the focal line is challenging. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present results of direct measurements of the flux profile along the length of a single axis tracking trough, and to develop simulation techniques that allow the reasons for peaks and troughs in the flux profile to be better understood...|$|R
