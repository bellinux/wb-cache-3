25|$|Toronto is {{situated}} by Lake Ontario and a <b>lake</b> <b>breeze</b> often develops during the day. This wind brings cooler {{air at the}} surface and causes a marine temperature inversion {{which could have been}} enough to keep the rotation aloft. To the west of the city, there is the Niagara Escarpment, reaching 1,500 feet above sea level, while the shores of Lake Ontario are just 250 feet ASL. This drop could equally have cut off the rotation from the surface.|$|E
25|$|On calm summer afternoons {{with little}} {{prevailing}} wind, sea breezes from both coasts may collide in the middle, creating especially severe storms {{down the center}} of the state. These thunderstorms can drift towards either the west or east coast depending on the relative strengths of the sea breezes, and sometimes survive to move out over the water at night, creating spectacular cloud-to-cloud lightning shows for hours after sunset. Due to its large size Lake Okeechobee may also contribute to this activity by creating its own <b>lake</b> <b>breeze</b> which collides with the east and west coast sea breezes.|$|E
25|$|Severe and non-severe {{thunderstorms}} peak {{in frequency}} from June through August but can occur at any time. Thunderstorms form from daytime convective heating and frontal activity; in the south, <b>lake</b> <b>breeze</b> convergences also intensify storms. Another severe type of thunderstorm {{is known as}} a Mesocyclonic Convective Complex or Derecho, which is a larger cluster-type thunderstorm mass with a more or less circular shape, often with a pronounced bow shape at its front or leading edge. During periods of hot weather in summer, they often develop in the afternoon west of the Great Lakes then strike Southern and Central Ontario at night with great forward motion, bringing severe straight-line winds over wide areas resulting in damage to forests, power interruption and infrastructure damage. The areas with the highest severe weather frequency in the province are Southwestern (Windsor, Chatham, Stratford corridor) and Central Ontario (Simcoe County including the city of Barrie, Lake Simcoe and the Kawartha Lakes region), both areas often getting amplified storms resulting from the <b>Lake</b> <b>Breeze</b> Front convergence. London has the most lightning strikes per year in Canada, averaging 34 days of thunderstorm activity per year. In a typical year, Ontario averages 15 confirmed tornado touchdowns, but this number has recently been increasing. These tornadoes, however, are rarely destructive (the vast majority are classified as F0 or F1 on the Fujita scale). In Northern Ontario, some tornadoes go undetected by ground spotters because of the sparse population and remote landscape; they are often discovered after the fact by aircraft pilots, where aerial observations of damaged forest confirm occurrences. All of Northern Ontario north of a line from Lake Nipigon to Timmins has no weather radar coverage by Environment Canada making it difficult to detect tornadoes in far northern Ontario when they occur. Tropical depression remnants can cause copious rains and winds in the south, but are rarely deadly. A notable exception was Hurricane Hazel in October 1954.|$|E

2500|$|As the sun sets, the {{convection}} current reverses and an offshore flow ensues causing a land breeze.

2500|$|The city of Toronto has a humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen: Dfa), with warm, humid summers and cold winters. The city experiences four distinct seasons, with considerable variance in length. Some {{parts of the}} north and east of the city such as Scarborough and the suburbs, have a climate classified as humid {{continental climate}} (Köppen: Dfb). As a result of the rapid passage of weather systems (such as high- and low-pressure systems), the weather is variable from day to day in all seasons. Owing to urbanization and its proximity to water, Toronto has a fairly low diurnal temperature range. The denser urban scape makes for warmer nights year around; the average nighttime temperature is about [...] warmer in the city than in rural areas in all months. However, it can be noticeably cooler on many spring and early summer afternoons under the influence of a <b>lake</b> <b>breeze</b> since Lake Ontario is cool, relative to the air during these seasons. These lake breezes mostly occur in summer, bringing relief on hot days. Other low-scale maritime effects on the climate include lake-effect snow, fog, and delaying of spring- and fall-like conditions, known as seasonal lag.|$|E

40|$|The NASA Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center, the Florida Institute of Technology, and the NOAA/NWS Weather Forecast Office at Miami, FL (MFL) are collaborating on {{a project}} to {{investigate}} the impact of using high-resolution, 2 -km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sea surface temperature (SST) composites within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) prediction system. The NWS MFL is currently running WRF in real-time to support daily forecast operations, using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model dynamical core within the NWS Science and Training Resource Center's Environmental Modeling System (EMS) software. Twenty-seven hour forecasts are run daily initialized at 0300, 0900, 1500, and 2100 UTC on a domain with 4 -km grid spacing covering the southern half of Florida and adjacent waters of the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. The SSTs are initialized with the NCEP Real-Time Global (RTG) analyses at 1 / 12 deg resolution. The project objective is to determine whether more accurate specification of the lower-boundary forcing over water using the MODIS SST composites within the 4 -km WRF runs will result in improved sea fluxes and hence, more accurate eõlutiono f coastal mesoscale circulations and the associated sensible weather elements. SPoRT conducted parallel WRF EMS runs from February to August 2007 identical to the operational runs at NWS MFL except {{for the use of}} MODIS SST composites in place of the RTG product as the initial and boundary conditions over water. During the course of this evaluation, an intriguing case was examined from 6 May 2007, in which <b>lake</b> <b>breezes</b> and convection around Lake Okeechobee evolved quite differently when using the high-resolution SPoRT MODIS SST composites versus the lower-resolution RTG SSTs.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that large lakes can perturb local weather and climate through {{mesoscale}} circulations, for example, lake effects on storms and <b>lake</b> <b>breezes,</b> and the impacts on fluxes of heat, moisture, and momentum. However, for both large and small lakes, the importance of atmosphere–lake interactions in northern Canada is largely unknown. Here, the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) is used to simulate seasonal time scales for the Mackenzie River basin and northwest region of Canada, coupled to simulations of Great Bear and Great Slave Lakes using the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) to examine the interactions between large northern lakes and the atmosphere. The authors consider the lake impacts on the local water and energy cycles and on regional seasonal climate. Verification of model results is achieved with atmospheric sounding and surface flux data collected during the Canadian Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) program. The coupled atmosphere–lake model is shown to be able to successfully simulate the variation of surface heat fluxes and surface water temperatures and to give a good representation of the vertical profiles of water temperatures, the warming and cooling processes, and the lake responses to the seasonal and interannual variation of surface heat fluxes. These northern lakes can significantly influence the local water and energy cycles...|$|R
50|$|Chicago can be {{cooler and}} moister than {{other parts of}} Illinois because of its {{proximity}} to the relatively cooler waters of Lake Michigan, effects which are most pronounced during spring and early summer. A frequent lakeshore breeze pushes much cooler, moister air into Chicago than the usual hot air of the Plains States (usually a moist air mass depending on upper level circulation), but the effect can be so localized that only the immediate waterfront neighborhoods (both north and southside lake adjacent communities) are cooler than inland parts of the city. South, west and southwestern suburbs can be more than 20 F warmer than the lakefront at some times of year. The <b>lake</b> <b>breeze</b> also has other effects, including dense fog spilling into the city. Because of the closed-loop circulation pattern with a <b>lake</b> <b>breeze</b> that moves {{back and forth across}} the city, it is thought to significantly increase low-level ozone counts. Differing wind direction on either side of the thermal dividing line allows for sharp updrafts under certain conditions, favorable to thunderstorm development. Offshore or land breezes shutdown the <b>lake</b> <b>breeze</b> and can have the opposite effect, with over lake convection occurring, usually in mid- to late summer and autumn. As a general rule, the opposite trend occurs during the winter—winter temperatures are warmer along the lakeshore and downtown than inland.|$|E

The grounds, where Farrar had had matters pretty much his own way, to my mind rivalled the best private parks in the East. The stables were filled with a score or so of Mr. Cooke's best horses, brought hither in his private cars, and the trotters were exercising on the track. The middle of June found Farrar and myself at the Asquith Inn. It was Farrar's custom to go to Asquith in the summer, being near the forest properties in his charge; and since Asquith was but five miles from the county-seat it was convenient for me, and gave me the advantages of the <b>lake</b> <b>breezes</b> and a comparative rest, which I should not have had in town. At that time Asquith was a small community of summer residents from Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis, and other western cities, most of whom owned cottages and the grounds around them. They were a quiet lot that long association had made clannish; and they had a happy faculty, so rare in summer resorts, of discrimination between an amusement and a nuisance. Hence a great many diversions which are accounted pleasurable elsewhere are at Asquith set down at their true value. It was, therefore, rather with resentment than otherwise that the approaching arrival of Mr. Cooke and the guests he was likely to have at Mohair were looked upon.|$|R
40|$|BackgroundBecause of {{the warming}} climate urban {{temperature}} patterns have been receiving increased attention. Temperature within urban areas can {{vary depending on}} land cover, meteorological and other factors. High resolution satellite data {{can be used to}} understand this intra-urban variability, although they have been primarily studied to characterize urban heat islands at a larger spatial scale. ObjectiveThis study examined whether satellite-derived impervious surface and meteorological conditions from multiple sites can improve characterization of spatial variability of temperature within an urban area. MethodsTemperature was measured at 17 outdoor sites throughout the Detroit metropolitan area during the summer of 2008. Kriging and linear regression were applied to daily temperatures and secondary information, including impervious surface and distance-to-water. Performance of models in predicting measured temperatures was evaluated by cross-validation. Variograms derived from several scenarios were compared to determine whether high-resolution impervious surface information could capture fine-scale spatial structure of temperature in the study area. ResultsTemperatures measured at the sites were significantly different from each other, and all kriging techniques generally performed better than the two linear regression models. Impervious surface values and distance-to-water generally improved predictions slightly. Restricting models to days with <b>lake</b> <b>breezes</b> and with less cloud cover also somewhat improved the predictions. In addition, incorporating high-resolution impervious surface information into cokriging or universal kriging enhanced the ability to characterize fine-scale spatial structure of temperature. ConclusionsMeteorological and satellite-derived data can better characterize spatial variability in temperature across a metropolitan region. The data sources and methods we used can be applied in epidemiological studies and public health interventions to protect vulnerable populations from extreme heat events.
