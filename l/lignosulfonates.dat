50|$|<b>Lignosulfonates</b> are {{recovered}} from the spent pulping liquids (red or brown liquor) from sulfite pulping. The most widely used industrial process is the Howard process, in which 90-95% yields of calcium <b>lignosulfonates</b> (CAS number 904-76-3), are precipitated by addition of excess calcium hydroxide. Ultrafiltration and ion-exchange {{can also be used}} to separate <b>lignosulfonates</b> from the spent pulping liquid. A list of CAS numbers for the various metal salts of lignosulfonate is available.|$|E
50|$|Chief among sulfite process {{byproducts}} are <b>lignosulfonates,</b> which find a {{wide variety}} of uses where a relatively inexpensive agent is needed to make a water dispersion of a water-insoluble material. <b>Lignosulfonates</b> are used in tanning leather, making concrete, drilling mud, drywall and so on.|$|E
5000|$|Aqueous Lignosulfonate {{solutions}} are also widely {{used as a}} non-toxic dust suppression agent for unpaved road surfaces, where it is popularly, if erroneously, called [...] "tree sap". Roads treated with <b>lignosulfonates</b> can be distinguished from those treated with calcium chloride by color: <b>lignosulfonates</b> give the road surface a dark grey color, while calcium chloride lend the road surface a distinctive tan or brown color. As <b>lignosulfonates</b> do not rely on water to provide their binding properties, {{they tend to be}} more useful in arid locations.|$|E
30|$|The char yield {{increased}} with increasing <b>lignosulfonate</b> contents, due to <b>lignosulfonate</b> aromatic structure and its native carbon–carbon bonds helping to promote char formation. The average {{mass loss rate}} (AMLR) measured by cone calorimeter decreased with increasing of <b>lignosulfonate</b> contents. <b>Lignosulfonate</b> increases thermal stability of RPU foams and L 15 RPU foam {{gives rise to the}} best thermal stability. The LOI values {{increased with}} increasing <b>lignosulfonate</b> addition, indicating that <b>lignosulfonate</b> has a certain degree of flame retardancy. The HRR and THR showed lower values at 15 – 20 % <b>lignosulfonate</b> loading and further increasing <b>lignosulfonate</b> replacement ratio results increasing HRR and THR values. The presence of <b>lignosulfonate</b> very effective in TPCO, the L 15 RPU foam postponed 96  s than that of pure DEG RPU foam, suggesting that <b>lignosulfonate</b> would be mainly act at condensed phase with higher char production.|$|R
30|$|LOI is {{the minimum}} oxygen {{concentration}} (vol%) which {{would support the}} combustion of a certain material, so the higher LOI value represents the better flame retardancy. In Fig.  2, {{the results showed that}} the LOI values increased with increasing <b>lignosulfonate</b> addition, indicating the enhancing effect on flame retardancy by <b>lignosulfonate.</b> <b>Lignosulfonate</b> is a natural macromolecule with substantial aromatic structures, and the LOI value increased with increasing <b>lignosulfonate</b> contents, indicating that <b>lignosulfonate</b> has a certain degree of flame retardancy due to <b>lignosulfonate</b> aromatic structure and its native carbon–carbon bonds helping to promote char formation. The result is in accord with the Chirico et al. [20], who reported that lignin played as fire retardant for PP.|$|R
30|$|Different wt% of <b>lignosulfonate</b> content LRPU foams were {{prepared}} as follows: blank (DEG), 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30  wt% of <b>lignosulfonate</b> content were measured {{from the above}} <b>lignosulfonate</b> polyol. <b>Lignosulfonate</b> polyol was mixed with distilled water as the foaming agent, the catalyst, and the flame retardants (DMMP and APP) until homogenization, and then, MDI- 200 was added into the mixture under continuous stirring. When it began to foam, the mixture was immediately poured into the mould. The obtained RPU foams without and with <b>lignosulfonate</b> designated as RPU and LRPU, and 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30  wt% of <b>lignosulfonate</b> content were designated as L 5 RPU, L 10 RPU, L 15 RPU, L 20 RPU, L 25 RPU, and L 30 RPU, respectively.|$|R

5000|$|Dimethyl sulfide and {{dimethyl}} sulfoxide (an important organic solvent) are produced from <b>lignosulfonates.</b> The first step involves heating <b>lignosulfonates</b> with sulfides or elemental sulfur to produce dimethyl sulfide. The methyl groups come from methyl ethers {{present in the}} lignin. Oxidation of dimethyl sulfide with nitrogen dioxide produces {{dimethyl sulfoxide}} (DMSO).|$|E
50|$|Oxidation of <b>lignosulfonates</b> from {{softwood}} trees produced vanillin (artificial vanilla flavor).|$|E
40|$|<b>Lignosulfonate</b> {{is a type}} {{of natural}} polymer surfactant. Its {{capability}} to reduce the surface tension of aqueous solution depends on its adsorption configuration at the air/liquid interface. The dynamic surface tension, the air/liquid interfacial film properties of <b>lignosulfonate</b> at different solution concentrations, pH values and ionic strengths had been measured in the present work. The results showed that the adsorption equilibrium of <b>lignosulfonate</b> at the air/liquid cannot be achieved in a short period; the diffusion coefficient of <b>lignosulfonate</b> from the liquid to the air/liquid interface decreased with the increasing of pH value, while it increased with the increasing of ionic strength. <b>Lignosulfonate</b> could form soluble monomolecular film at the air/liquid interface, whereas the film was unstable. The stability of <b>lignosulfonate</b> monomolecular film became poor with the increasing of solution concentration, ionic strength and decreasing of pH value. Combining with our previous research results, the adsorption mechanism of <b>lignosulfonate</b> at the air/liquid interface was proposed...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} {{of wheat}} straw ammonium sulfite pulping spent liquor and the chelating property of nitrogen-fixed ammonium <b>lignosulfonate</b> were studied. Results showed that free ammonium nitrogen in spent liquor could be fixed by formaldehyde. When {{the amount of}} formaldehyde was 10 % based on the dry weight of <b>lignosulfonate,</b> 30 % of inorganic nitrogen was converted into organic nitrogen, of which 87. 4 % was ammonium <b>lignosulfonate</b> and 12. 6 % was urotropine. The proper chelating condition of nitrogen-fixed ammonium <b>lignosulfonate</b> was as follows: pH: 3, hydrogen peroxide: 10 %, FeSO 4 : 40. 9 %, and 50 oC for 30 min. Under this reaction condition, the chelating ratio of Fe 2 + was measured as 15. 1 %. Chelation {{did not result in}} Fe(OH) 3 precipitation under alkaline conditions. Effects of H 2 O 2 dosage on the structure of ammonium <b>lignosulfonate</b> were also studied. The content of carboxyl, phenolic hydroxyl, and conjugated carbonyl groups in <b>lignosulfonate</b> that could be chelated with metal ions increased after ammonium <b>lignosulfonate</b> was oxidized. Average molecular weight and distribution were also determined with GPC. Results showed that the proportion of higher molecular weight components increased after oxidation of ammonium <b>lignosulfonate,</b> indicating that oxidative degradation and condensation reaction proceeded during oxidative treatment and condensation was the main reaction. The increase of molecular weight could improve the chelating ability of ammonium <b>lignosulfonate...</b>|$|R
40|$|Internal erosional {{behaviour}} of <b>lignosulfonate</b> treated {{dispersive clay}} {{has been studied}} using the Process Simulation Apparatus for Internal Crack Erosion (PSAICE) designed and built at UOW. Effectiveness of <b>lignosulfonate</b> treated dispersive clay on the erosion resistance has been investigated and its advantage over traditional admixtures is presented. Test {{results show that the}} hydraulic shear stress increases with increase in the amount of <b>lignosulfonate.</b> In addition, the micro-chemical analysis has been carried out using FTIR. Based on the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy results a stabilization mechanism has been proposed for <b>lignosulfonate</b> treated dispersive soil...|$|R
5000|$|In sulfite pulping, lignin {{is removed}} from wood pulp as sulfonates. These <b>lignosulfonates</b> have several uses: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{single largest}} use for <b>lignosulfonates</b> is as {{plasticizers}} in making concrete, where they allow concrete {{to be made}} with less water (giving stronger concrete) while maintaining {{the ability of the}} concrete to flow. <b>Lignosulfonates</b> are also used during the production of cement, where they act as grinding aids in the cement mill and as a rawmix slurry deflocculant (that reduces the viscosity of the slurry).|$|E
50|$|Also one of {{the very}} wide uses of <b>lignosulfonates</b> is {{deflocculation}} of clays used in drilling fluids in the oil and gas industry.|$|E
30|$|<b>Lignosulfonate</b> was {{dispersed}} in DEG at 80  °C for 2  h {{under constant}} stirring. After that the mixture was cooled to room temperature, then <b>lignosulfonate</b> polyol was finally obtained.|$|R
40|$|<b>Lignosulfonate</b> {{is a major}} {{byproduct}} {{from the}} sulphite pulping process {{which is the most}} abundant biopolymer and largely unused. Although <b>lignosulfonate</b> is nontoxic, it impacts brownish black colour to water and makes the water unsuitable for reuse. However, <b>lignosulfonate</b> have a wide range application, such as production of vanillin, animal feed pellets binder and pesticides. Therefore, an efficient separation technique of <b>lignosulfonate</b> from the wastewater is necessary {{in order to meet the}} wastewater treatment requirement and as a source of valuable material for industrial applications. In this study, <b>lignosulfonate</b> was extracted from aqueous solution through flat sheet supported liquid membrane (SLM) using trioctylamine (TOA) as carrier. SLM has great potential for the separation <b>lignosulfonate</b> as it offers advantages such as simultaneous extraction and stripping steps, low consumption of carrier and high selectivity. The important parameters governing the extraction process are the types of support material, types of solvents, types of stripping agent, feed phase flow rate and pH were investigated. The favorable condition for extraction was obtained by using TOA-Kerosene-PVDF membrane system, 0. 5 M NaOH as stripping agent, 100 mL/min of flow rate and feed at pH 2 with 37. 5 % of <b>lignosulfonate</b> removal. The result demonstrated that the membrane support remains stable for more than 9 hours, hence demonstrating promising separation technique for <b>lignosulfonate...</b>|$|R
30|$|NMR {{analysis}} of <b>lignosulfonate</b> has been also reported. Lutnaes et al. [55] characterized fifteen monomeric and seven dimeric sulfonated model compounds by NMR. However, the NMR study of <b>lignosulfonate</b> is little [52].|$|R
50|$|<b>Lignosulfonates,</b> or {{sulfonated}} lignin, (CAS number 8062-15-5) are water-soluble anionic polyelectrolyte polymers: {{they are}} byproducts from {{the production of}} wood pulp using sulfite pulping.|$|E
50|$|The sulfite process {{does not}} degrade lignin {{to the same}} extent that the kraft process does and the <b>lignosulfonates</b> from the sulfite process are useful byproducts.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability of}} <b>lignosulfonates</b> {{to reduce the}} {{viscosity}} of mineral slurries is used to advantage in oil drilling mud, where it replaced tannic acids from quebracho (a tropical tree).|$|E
30|$|Different ratio <b>lignosulfonate</b> and APP LRPU foams were {{prepared}} using 16.5  wt% of <b>lignosulfonate</b> polyol, {{and the other}} ingredients in the formulation were the same with different <b>lignosulfonate</b> content RPU foams. Lignosulfonate: APP was 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 3, 1 : 4, and 1 : 5 were designated as LRPU 1, LRPU 2, LRPU 3, LRPU 4, and LRPU 5, respectively.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>lignosulfonate</b> on {{viscosity}} of organic coal-water-fuel (OCWF) was investigated. Brown coal from "Borodinskoe" deposit, waste oil Motul 8100 X-Clean 5 W- 30 -C 3, distilled water and powdered <b>lignosulfonate</b> {{was used as}} raw materials for slurry preparation. OCWF viscosity were measured using a rotational viscometer BROOKFIELD DV-II + Pro EXTRA. Optimum <b>lignosulfonate</b> concentration was obtained (1. 3 - 1. 4 %) ...|$|R
30|$|In this study, <b>lignosulfonate</b> {{contents}} {{ranging from}} 0 to 30  wt% were mixed with DEG {{to investigate the}} effect of <b>lignosulfonate</b> contents on thermal stability of LRPU foams. TGA measurements were performed to evaluate the thermal stability of these LRPU foams, and the corresponding results are presented in Fig.  1 and Table  1. RPU and LRPU foams show two steps thermal degradation in the 100 – 180  °C range with maximum degradation temperature (Tmax 1) around 140  °C and the 250 – 350  °C range with maximum degradation temperature (Tmax 2) around 300  °C, respectively (Fig.  1). The first step weight loss was less than 5 %, and {{may be due to}} evaporation of water and decomposition of low molecular compounds. The second degradation step weight loss account for more than 50 % would be major decomposition step (Table  1). Tmax 2 of RPU foam from DEG was at 288  °C, and Tmax 2 progressively shifted towards the higher temperature with an increasing in the amount of <b>lignosulfonate</b> in the sample. Tmax 2 of L 15 RPU appeared at 304  °C, while further increasing <b>lignosulfonate</b> loading, there was no distinct difference at Tmax 2. It is noteworthy that mass loss was the lowest at 15 % <b>lignosulfonate</b> content, and further increasing <b>lignosulfonate</b> loading the mass loss was increased more than 50 %, suggesting that the thermal stability of RPU foams is really affected by the presence of <b>lignosulfonate,</b> and the best dosage is 15 % <b>lignosulfonate</b> loading.|$|R
50|$|Lignosulfonate {{have very}} broad ranges of {{molecular}} mass (they are very polydisperse). A range of from 1000-140,000 da {{has been reported}} for softwood <b>lignosulfonates</b> with lower values reported for hardwoods.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lignosulfonates</b> {{are used}} to {{disperse}} pesticides, dyes, carbon black, and other insoluble solids and liquids into water. They are used in tanning leather. They are also used to suppress dust on unpaved roads.|$|E
50|$|Oxidation of <b>lignosulfonates</b> {{was used}} to produce {{vanillin}} (artificial vanilla), and this process is still used by one supplier (Borregaard, Norway) while all North American production by this route ceased in the 1990s.|$|E
30|$|The char yield is a {{critical}} factor in flame retardant performance during combustion. Lignin aromatic chemical structure is able to give a very high char yield [20]. The char yield increased after <b>lignosulfonate</b> addition (Table  1), suggests that <b>lignosulfonate</b> contributes to the formation of char during thermal decomposition process due to the native carbon–carbon bonds, aromatic structure and the fact that <b>lignosulfonate</b> molecules easily condense when heated in nitrogen [7, 21].|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of <b>lignosulfonate</b> onto a commercial, modified {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT-PNN) {{powder in}} aqueous suspension {{and its effect on}} particle zeta potential and suspension rheology were investigated as functions of pH and <b>lignosulfonate</b> dosage. Langmuir analysis of the adsorption data demonstrated that a significant component of the overall driving force of adsorption at all pH values examined was specific (nonelectrostatic) bonding. Electrostatic bonding provided a significant contribution to adsorption at pH 6. 0, but diminished at lower pH owing to decreased <b>lignosulfonate</b> ionization and at higher pH due to decreased positive surface site concentration on the PZT-PNN. The affinity of adsorption was highest at pH 6. 0 because the electrostatic component was maximal at this pH. The zeta potential magnitude increased and the apparent viscosity decreased with increasing pH and increasing <b>lignosulfonate</b> dosage, up to approximately monolayer coverage. The <b>lignosulfonate</b> dosage required for monolayer coverage decreased with increasing pH owing to increasing <b>lignosulfonate</b> expansion and the decrease in concentration of positive surface sites on the PZT-PNN. Suspension stabilization was considered to occur by an electrosteric mechanism. 13 page(s...|$|R
30|$|It is {{suggested}} that a suitable phosphorus/nitrogen/carbon (P/N/C) ratio in the IFR system {{is very important for}} its flame retardancy [4]. In this study, the proportion of <b>lignosulfonate</b> (carbonization agent)-to-APP (acid and blowing agent) ratios was studied to investigate the flame retardancy of <b>lignosulfonate</b> and APP combination in LRPU foams. As a natural macromolecule with substantial carbon–carbon bonds and abundant hydroxyl group, <b>lignosulfonate</b> could act as carbonization agent in intumescent flame retardant system.|$|R
50|$|The tannic acid, in {{the form}} of {{alkalized}} salts, was extensively used as a deflocculant in drilling muds in 1940s-1950s, until it was replaced with <b>lignosulfonates.</b> Its red color gave the mixture the name red mud.|$|E
50|$|Plasticizers can {{be added}} to {{wallboard}} stucco mixtures to improve workability. In order to reduce the energy in drying wallboard, less water is added, which makes the gypsum mixture very unworkable and difficult to mix, necessitating the use of plasticizers, water reducers or dispersants. Some studies also show that too much of lignosulfonate dispersant could result in a set-retarding effect. Data showed that amorphous crystal formations occurred that detracted from the mechanical needle-like crystal interaction in the core, preventing a stronger core. The sugars, chelating agents in <b>lignosulfonates</b> such as Aldonic acids and extractive compounds are mainly responsible for set retardation. These low range water reducing dispersants are commonly manufactured from <b>lignosulfonates,</b> a by-product from the paper industry.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lignosulfonates</b> {{are also}} used for the {{production}} of plasterboard {{to reduce the amount of}} water required to make the stucco flow and form the layer between two sheets of paper. The reduction in water content allows lower kiln temperatures to dry the plasterboard, saving energy.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lignosulfonate</b> is a {{colloidal}} polyelectrolyte that {{is obtained}} {{as a side}} product in sulfite pulping. In this work we wanted to study the noncovalent association of the colloids in different solvents, {{as well as to}} find out how the charged sulfonate groups are organized on the colloid surface. We studied sodium and rubidium <b>lignosulfonate</b> in water amp; 8722;methanol mixtures and in dimethyl formamide. The number average molecular weights of the Na and Rb <b>lignosulfonate</b> fractions were 7600 g mol and 9100 g mol, respectively, and the polydispersity index for both was 2. Anomalous small angle X ray scattering ASAXS was used for determining the distribution of counterions around the Rb <b>lignosulfonate</b> macromolecules. The scattering curves were fitted with a model constructed from ellipsoids of revolution of different sizes. Counterions were taken into account by deriving an approximative formula for the scattering intensity of the Poisson amp; 8722;Boltzmann diffuse double layer model. The interaction term between the spheroidal particles was estimated using the local monodisperse approximation and the improved Hayter amp; 8722;Penfold structure factor given by the rescaled mean spherical approximation. Effective charge of the polyelectrolyte and the local dielectric constant of the solvent close to the globular polyelectrolyte were followed {{as a function of the}} methanol content in the solvent and <b>lignosulfonate</b> concentration. The <b>lignosulfonate</b> macromolecules were found to aggregate noncovalently in water amp; 8722;methanol mixtures with increasing methanol or <b>lignosulfonate</b> content in a specific directional manner. The flat macromolecule aggregates had a nearly constant thickness of 1 amp; 8722; 1. 4 nm, while their diameter grew when counterion association onto the polyelectrolyte increased.
