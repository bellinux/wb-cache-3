5|$|Character Designers Carter Goodrich, Carlos Grangel and Nicolas Marlet {{worked on}} setting {{the design and}} overall <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{character}}s. Drawing on various inspirations for the widely known characters, the team of character designers worked on designs that had a more realistic feel than the usual animated characters up to that time. Both character design and art direction worked to set a definite distinction between the symmetrical, more angular <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Egyptians versus the more organic, natural <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hebrews and their related environments. The Backgrounds department, headed by supervisors Paul Lasaine and Ron Lukas, oversaw a team of artists who were responsible for painting the sets/backdrops from the layouts. Within the film, approximately 934 hand-painted backgrounds were created.|$|E
5|$|Designers {{restored}} the light corridors {{inside the building}} during the remodel. These two central light courts allowed more natural lighting into {{the interior of the}} building. Additionally, the old Fourth Avenue entrance was restored, and the address was changed to 1221 S.W. Fourth Avenue. Renovations also {{restored the}} original <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> City Council chamber, with council members now facing the windows.|$|E
5|$|Make-up {{supervisor}} Michael Westmore {{created the}} <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bynars, who were four women in extensive make-up. The musical score was scored by Ron Jones. Reviewers praised the Bynars themselves, {{and the response}} to the episode was generally positive, with one critic calling it the best of the season. It was awarded an Emmy Award for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series.|$|E

50|$|Michael Fish (born 1940) is a British fashion {{designer}} famous for designing many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notable British <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1960s and 1970s, {{such as the}} kipper tie.|$|R
5|$|The 2013 {{video game}} The Last of Us, {{which takes place}} twenty years after an apocalyptic event, uses The World Without Us as {{inspiration}} for the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city settings.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} filmed on sets that are an exact {{replica of the}} house. Details such as Louis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows, and {{hammered}} bronze light fixtures, were re-created to preserve the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. The house became available for rent on Airbnb for six months, beginning February 2016, before being unlisted.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} of {{this bird}} {{can usually be}} distinguished by their difference in size and plumage. The subspecies Phaethon aethereus mesonauta can be differentiated by its slightly rosy tinge when its plumage is fresh, the bolder <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black barring on the upperwing, and the more solid <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black on the outer wing. The subspecies P. a. indicus can be distinguished by its smaller size, its smaller mask on the face, which often does not extend far behind the eye, and its more orange bill with black cutting edge.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> nicknames <b>of</b> {{this class}} are Alppiruusu (Edelweiss), Käkikello (Cuckoo clock), both {{referring}} to <b>the</b> Swiss origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locomotive, and Marsu (Guinea pig), from <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locomotive.|$|R

5|$|The visual <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{motion picture}} The Dark Crystal, {{directed}} by Jim Henson and Frank Oz, {{was developed by}} primary concept artist and chief creature designer, Brian Froud, who was inspired by Bauer's art.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Roger Deakins {{discussed}} the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film with the Coens during pre-production. They {{told him that}} they wanted {{some parts of the}} film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look. Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, {{the mall}} was sold by Simon Property Group to Vornado Realty Trust, which began plans {{to convert the}} mall's format, with {{high-profile}} stores, and changes in <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mall.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> 2008 version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Focus RS WRC {{includes}} design style {{changes as}} well as engine improvements. Style changes to the grill area reflect <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recently previewed Focus RS Mk II road sport car.|$|R
5|$|The bridge had {{temporary}} fencing and new walkways along a six-lane span, with locals {{saying that}} the stone structure fitting into <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scenic Delaware River Valley. The old bridge was demolished after construction completed.|$|R
5|$|Contracting out to {{independent}} studios, Philips subsequently used the characters to create three {{games for the}} CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give input on the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters based on the artwork from Nintendo's original two titles and that of their respective instruction booklets. Philips insisted that the development studios utilize {{all aspects of the}} CD-i's capabilities including FMV, high-resolution graphics, and CD-quality music. Because the system had not been designed as a dedicated video game console, there were several technical limitations, such as laggy controls (especially for the standard infrared controller), and numerous problems in streaming-audio, memory, disc access, and graphics.|$|E
5|$|During the film's pre-production, Schliessler was {{inspired}} by British-American photojournalist Tim Hetherington's war photography book Infidel, which details a single U.S. platoon assigned to an outpost in the Korengal Valley {{during the war in}} Afghanistan. The book's images became a guide to creating the overall <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film after Schliessler had shown them to Berg, as well as the art and costume departments. Prior to filming, Schleissler and Berg shot test footage with the digital cameras and brought it to digital colorist Stefan Sonnenfeld at post-production facility Company 3 for color grading.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of the PlayStation 2, Sony {{reported}} that the new system had compatibility issues with the Final Fantasy V half of Final Fantasy Anthology. The game experienced a bug where if players attempted to save their games, a graphical error would occur. Square then released a statement that only the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> save screen was corrupted, and saving was still possible, and if players wished, repeatedly going {{into and out of the}} save screen would make a normal screen eventually appear. This incompatibility was fixed for the PAL and Greatest Hits releases of Final Fantasy Anthology.|$|E
5000|$|A {{shrine to}} the Corrs or more {{correctly}} 'The Corrs Shrine'. Essentially Herring's infatuation with Andrea Corr. <b>The</b> rest <b>of</b> them (particularly <b>the</b> [...] "Man Corr") he didn't care for, a joke based on <b>the</b> similar <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corr sisters.|$|R
50|$|Fans {{are also}} able to get behind-the-scenes <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{organization}} with daily tours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium. The two-hour tour takes visitors from <b>the</b> bowels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium up to the press box and ends with an autograph session featuring team mascot Ballapeño.|$|R
5000|$|From launch, {{the site}} {{provided}} silly weekly news stories, {{detailed information on}} individual law firms [...] - including the salaries they pay - and weekly features such as 'glamorous solicitor' [...] showcasing some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more interesting <b>looking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's lawyers.|$|R
5|$|Green {{also took}} photos of a {{prepared}} list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio. These included many real estate offices and homes {{such as those}} belonging to Marion and her sister. He also found a girl who looked just like he imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor. The <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bates house was modeled on Edward Hopper's painting The House by the Railroad, a fanciful portrait of the Second Empire Victorian home at 18 Conger Avenue in Haverstraw, New York.|$|E
5|$|In {{over one}} or more sittings, a highly skilled {{sculptor}} from Madame Tussauds Studios who is given {{direct access to the}} celebrity will record the colours of the hair and eyes, and over 500 precise body measurements are referenced. Most important is to capture the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task is to make a clay model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E
5|$|Italy was MGM's top {{choice for}} hosting the {{production}}. However, {{a number of}} countries—including France, Mexico, Spain, and the United Kingdom—were also considered. Cinecittà Studios, a very large motion picture production facility constructed in 1937 {{on the outskirts of}} Rome, was identified early on as the primary shooting location. Zimbalist hired Wyler's long-term production supervisor, Henry Henigson, to oversee the film, and art directors William A. Horning and Edward Carfagno created the overall <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film, relying on the more than five years of research which had already been completed for the production. A skeleton crew of studio technicians arrived in the summer of 1956 to begin preparing the Cinecittà soundstages and back lot.|$|E
5000|$|Bus {{and coach}} {{industry}} graphic designer Ray Stenning praised <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Panorama Elite III {{in an article}} for Buses Annual 1981. He described it as Plaxton's [...] "zenith", adding that it [...] "looked just right and still looks just right".|$|R
50|$|As was {{the case}} with the E46 M3 Concept and E60 M5 Concept, the M3 Concept had almost no {{differences}} from <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production version, that had its world premiere on the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show IAA (Germany, 12 to 23 September).|$|R
50|$|In 1982, {{the first}} Birchfield Sports was {{produced}} {{but it was}} only intended to be a one-off. A company called Shapecraft in Northampton, UK, then developed the concept further as a (small) production-run vehicle using Jaguar XJ6 mechanicals, with <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS Jaguar.|$|R
5|$|Meyer {{had never}} been happy with the brightly lit {{corridors}} and feel of the Enterprise, a dissatisfaction that extended to his work on The Wrath of Khan. For The Undiscovered Country, Meyer wanted the Enterprise interiors to feel grittier and more realistic; the metal was worn around the edges to look used without looking beat up. Narita's plans to transform the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enterprise on a scale not seen since The Wrath of Khan were complicated by the necessary use of existing sets.|$|E
5|$|Netflix {{required}} the production to shoot with 4K cameras {{to make the}} <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show future-proof and John Toll who is credited as the main director of photography for overseeing the distinct <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nine featured locations, {{made the decision to}} shoot by using mostly Sony's CineAlta PMW-F55 cameras, paired with Carl Zeiss Ultra Prime and Cooke Optics S4 lenses. During the first season, Toll, once again collaborating with the Wachowskis and Glass after Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending, personally handled the cinematography in San Francisco, Chicago, London, Iceland, and Seoul. Toll's approach to shooting was to use a lot of Steadicam and hand-held partly out of the necessity to follow the faster schedule of a television production compared to the feature films he was used to working on. Additional cinematographers worked {{with the rest of the}} directors in the remaining locations and they used a similar shooting style because they were facing the same scheduling challenges. McTeigue's cinematographer of choice for shooting in Mexico City and Mumbai was Danny Ruhlmann, who previously shot The Raven and Survivor for him. Tykwer worked with Frank Griebe and Christian Almesberger for the Berlin and Nairobi scenes respectively. Griebe had previously shot seven feature films of Tykwer's including Cloud Atlas and Almesberger was the cinematographer of two films Tykwer had produced in Nairobi: Soul Boy and Nairobi Half Life.|$|E
5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower masts in {{wood was}} not feasible, {{so they were}} made of steel tube cut and welded to shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the {{platforms}} on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. Warriors engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron to duplicate the <b>look</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they might have looked in operation.|$|E
50|$|The Airflite blends <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chrysler Crossfire and Pacifica in its {{exterior}} design. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Airflite (mainly {{the front}} and rear) {{were based on the}} Crossfire. The seven-spoke road wheel design is based on the Crossfire, as is the satin trimmed windshield.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{external}} <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS1s {{are strongly}} {{similar to the}} FN FNC, ranging from the pistol grip to the stock, receiver and barrel. Optics can be mounted onto the SS1 rifles, but a special optic mount be installed first before any optic can be used.|$|R
50|$|The {{setting and}} {{synopsis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film were freely adapted from Serge Brussolo's novel A l'image du dragon, {{with a slightly}} lighter tone. The characters, backgrounds and general <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film were conceived by French illustrator and comic author Caza. The original soundtrack was composed by Didier Lockwood.|$|R
