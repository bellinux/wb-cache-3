5|$|During the 10th and 11th centuries, {{power struggles}} {{occurred}} between rulers in northern and western France {{including those of}} Anjou, Normandy, Brittany, Poitou, Blois, Maine, and the kings of France. In the early 12th century Geoffrey of Anjou married Empress Matilda, King Henry I's only surviving <b>legitimate</b> <b>child</b> and heir to the English throne. As {{a result of this}} marriage, Geoffrey's son Henry II inherited the English throne as well as Norman and Angevin titles, thus marking the beginning of the Angevin and Plantagenet dynasties.|$|E
5|$|Foliot {{attended}} the Second Lateran Council, called by Pope Innocent II. It opened on 4April 1139, and among other matters heard an appeal from the Empress Matilda concerning her {{claim to the}} throne of England. Matilda was the daughter and only surviving <b>legitimate</b> <b>child</b> of King Henry I, but following her father's death in late 1135 her cousin Stephen, the son of Henry's sister, had seized the crown. By 1139 Matilda had gathered supporters and was contesting Stephen's right to the throne.|$|E

5|$|The King {{was buried}} in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 15 July. His only <b>legitimate</b> <b>child,</b> Princess Charlotte of Wales, had died from post-partum {{complications}} in 1817, after delivering a stillborn son. The second son of George III, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, had died childless in 1827, so the succession passed to the third son of George III, Prince William, Duke of Clarence, who reigned as William IV.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{was born}} on 7 or 8 December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland, to King James V and his French second wife, Mary of Guise. She {{was said to have}} been born prematurely and was the only <b>legitimate</b> <b>child</b> of James to survive him. She was the great-niece of King Henry VIII of England, as her {{paternal}} grandmother, Margaret Tudor, was Henry VIII's sister. On 14December, six days after her birth, she became Queen of Scots when her father died, perhaps from the effects of a nervous collapse following the Battle of Solway Moss, or from drinking contaminated water while on campaign.|$|E
5|$|Mary, {{the only}} {{surviving}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>child</b> of James V of Scotland, was six days old {{when her father}} died and she acceded to the throne. She {{spent most of her}} childhood in France while Scotland was ruled by regents, and in 1558, she married the Dauphin of France, Francis. He ascended the French throne as King Francis II in 1559, and Mary briefly became queen consort of France, until his death in December 1560. Widowed, Mary returned to Scotland, arriving in Leith on 19 August 1561. Four years later, she married her first cousin, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, but their union was unhappy. In February 1567, his residence was destroyed by an explosion, and Darnley was found murdered in the garden.|$|E

5|$|After Henry's {{death in}} 1135 the {{succession}} was disputed between the king's nephews—Stephen and his elder brother Theobald II, Count of Champagne—and Henry's surviving <b>legitimate</b> <b>child</b> Matilda, usually {{known as the}} Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V. King Henry's only legitimate son, William, had died in 1120. After Matilda was widowed in 1125 {{she returned to her}} father, who married her to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but after Henry I's death in 1135 Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned, before Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was less sanguine and secured the support of the Scottish king, David, her maternal uncle, and in 1138 that of her half-brother, Robert, Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of HenryI.|$|E

Matilda's brother, and King Henry's only legitimate son, William died in 1120, leaving Matilda as Henry's only legitimate offspring. After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to England, where her father married her to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but when Henry I died in 1135, Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned before either Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald acquiesced to his brother's usurpation.|$|E
5|$|For most of George's regency and reign, Lord Liverpool {{controlled}} {{the government as}} Prime Minister, with little help from George. His ministers found his behaviour selfish, unreliable and irresponsible. At all times he was much {{under the influence of}} favourites. Taxpayers were angry at his wasteful spending at a time when Britons were fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. He did not provide national leadership in time of crisis, nor act as a role model for his people. Liverpool's government presided over Britain's ultimate victory, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed. After Liverpool's retirement, George was forced to accept Catholic emancipation despite opposing it. His only <b>legitimate</b> <b>child,</b> Princess Charlotte, died before him in 1817 and so he was succeeded by his younger brother, William.|$|E

5|$|With William Adelin dead, Henry {{had only}} one other <b>legitimate</b> <b>child,</b> Matilda, but as a woman she was at a {{substantial}} political disadvantage. Despite Henry taking a second wife, Adeliza of Louvain, it became increasingly unlikely {{that he would have}} another legitimate son, and he instead looked to Matilda as his intended heir. Matilda claimed the title of Holy Roman Empress through her marriage to Emperor Henry V, but her husband died in 1125, and she was remarried in 1128 to Geoffrey, the Count of Anjou, whose lands bordered the Duchy of Normandy. Geoffrey was unpopular with the Anglo-Norman elite: as an Angevin ruler, he was a traditional enemy of the Normans. At the same time, tensions continued to grow as a result of Henry's domestic policies, in particular the high level of revenue he was raising to pay for his various wars. Conflict was curtailed, however, by the power of the King's personality and reputation.|$|E

But Matilda was less sanguine, and secured the support of her maternal uncle, the Scottish king David I, and in 1138 also that of her half-brother Robert, Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of Henry I. Nobles in the Welsh Marches revolted against Stephen in 1136, but the revolt was not settled until 1138. In 1139, Matilda invaded southern England with her half-brother's support and the period of civil war began.|$|E
