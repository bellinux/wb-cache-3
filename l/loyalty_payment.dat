50|$|In 2000, Ruddock {{moved to}} Crystal Palace on a free transfer, {{spending}} one season there before signing for Division Two side Swindon Town. He scored twice for Swindon, with goals against Colchester {{in the league}} and Hartlepool in the FA Cup. Relations turned sour when Ruddock refused to quit after being advised to do so by a specialist; during a period of time where the club was in serious financial difficulties. The club responded by appointing Steve Coppell as assistant manager and taking Ruddock's coaching duties away. The board eventually stopped paying Ruddock's wages in an attempt to drive him out. He took the club to an employment tribunal and in December 2002 received £57,000, representing money lost in wages and <b>loyalty</b> <b>payments,</b> with an agreement to terminate his contract as player/coach.|$|R

60|$|The Lodging--dearest reader, {{if you are}} tired, pray {{pass over}} the next four or five pages--was not by any means so large as its {{external}} appearance led people to conjecture. The interior accommodation was much cut up by cross walls and long passages, and that neglect of economizing space which characterizes old Scottish architecture. But there was far more room than my old friend required, even when she had, as was often the case, four or five young cousins under her protection; and I believe much of the house was unoccupied. Mrs. Bethune Baliol never, in my presence, showed herself so much offended as once with a meddling person who advised her to have the windows of these supernumerary apartments built up to save the tax. She said in ire that, while she lived, the light of God should visit the house of her fathers; and while she had a penny, king and country should have their due. Indeed, she was punctiliously loyal, even in that most staggering test of <b>loyalty,</b> the <b>payment</b> of imposts. Mr. Beauffet told me he was ordered to offer a glass of wine to the person who collected the income tax, and that the poor man was so overcome by a reception so unwontedly generous, that he had well-nigh fainted on the spot.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} the 18th century that the village rose to prominence. At the {{beginning}} of the century the village was under control of Shaykh Ali Zaydani, the uncle of Zahir al-Umar and leading shaykh of lower Galilee. It is also known that there was a castle in the village at least as early as 1740. After Zahir al-Umar's rise to power in the 1740s, Ali Zaydani was replaced with his nephew, Uthman; a son of Zahir. After Zahir's death in 1775, Jazzar Pasha allowed Uthman to continue as the governor of Shefa-'Amr in return for a promise of <b>loyalty</b> and advance <b>payment</b> of taxes. Jazzar Pasha allowed the fortress to remain intact despite orders from Constantinople that it should be destroyed.

40|$|NFC-enabled devices {{based on}} Card Emulation (CE) can emulate {{multiple}} smartcards, thereby allowing <b>payments,</b> <b>loyalty,</b> ticketing and other custom services. Nowadays, the main technologies granting card emulation are: i) secure elements (SE), i. e. tamper-resistant hardware components allowing the secure hosting of card emulation applications and ii) Host- based Card Emulation (HCE), i. e. software solutions offering limited security guarantees. Since both approaches {{are not able}} to grant a satisfying level of both usability and security, a new framework, called Trusted Host-based Card Emulation (THCE), has been recently proposed. However, THCE is an abstract framework that has not been ported on actual devices yet. In this respect, this paper discusses TEA (i. e. ThcE for Android) a porting of the THCE framework on TEE-enabled Android devices. Experimental results carried out on a real use case scenario (i. e., VISA card transactions) show that the approach is promising...|$|R
25|$|Al-Jazzar {{continued}} {{to lobby for}} appointment as wali of Sidon Eyalet and was approaching open rebellion against the Ottomans in protest at not receiving the post. However, in May 1777, al-Jazzar was officially appointed wali. That year, al-Jazzar requested assistance against Emir Yusuf from Muhammad Pasha al-Azm, the wali of Damascus, and his son Yusuf Pasha al-Azm, the wali of Tripoli. Both refused, citing Emir Yusuf's <b>loyalty</b> and regular <b>payment</b> of taxes. They also feared al-Jazzar's growing power more than Emir Yusuf. Al-Jazzar dispatched the commander of his Maghrebi troops in Sidon, Mustafa ibn Qara Mulla, to collect payments from the Druze clans and kill Emir Yusuf. In his first foray into Mount Lebanon, the Druze forced him to retreat to Sidon. Mustafa was also unsuccessful in his second offensive, this time through the Beqaa Valley. In the latter offensive, the harvest of the valley was confiscated and the two sides entered into indecisive clashes.|$|R
40|$|Near Field Communication (NFC) {{promises}} to boost mobile transactions and payments. Indeed, NFC-enabled devices can emulate smartcards, so allowing <b>payments,</b> <b>loyalty</b> programs, card access, transit passes and other custom services, through a mobile phone. Although many modern mobile devices mount a NFC transceiver, card emulation {{is still a}} rare feature. The main {{reason is that the}} two available card emulation frameworks, namely Card Emulation and Host-based Card Emulation, have known limitations in terms of usability and security (respectively). This paper proposes a novel approach to card emulation called Trusted Host-based Card Emulation (THCE). THCE relies on the Trusted Execution Environment, currently deployed on most of the CPUs for mobile devices, and implements a secure and usable card emulation framework. Through comparisons, we show that THCE overcomes the limitations of the existing solutions. Moreover, we formally verify that the initialization protocol, used to deploy access credentials on a THCE-enabled device, is not vulnerable to known exploits...|$|R
50|$|Sharwin I, {{along with}} the Karenid ruler Vandad Hormozd, led the native {{resistance}} to Muslim rule and the efforts at Islamization and settlement begun by the Abbasid governor, Khalid ibn Barmak (768-772). Following his departure, the native princes destroyed the towns he had built in the highlands, and although in 781 they affirmed loyalty to the Caliphate, in 782 they launched a general anti-Muslim revolt that was not suppressed until 785, when Sa'id al-Harashi led 40,000 troops into the region. Relations with the caliphal governors in the lowlands improved thereafter, but the Bavandid and Karenid princes remained united in their opposition to Muslim penetration of the highlands, {{to the extent that}} they prohibited even the burial of Muslims there. Isolated acts of defiance like the murder of a tax collector occurred, but when the two princes were summoned before Harun al-Rashid in 805 they promised <b>loyalty</b> and the <b>payment</b> of a tax, and were forced to leave their sons behind as hostages for four years.|$|R

Initially these systems were not sophisticated {{and many of the}} early systems did not support a remote printer in the kitchen. Tablet systems today are being used in all types of restaurants including table service operations. Most tablet systems upload all information to the Internet so managers and owners can view reports from anywhere with a password and Internet connection. Smartphone Internet access has made alerts and reports from the POS very accessible. Tablets have helped create the Mobile POS system, and Mobile POS applications also include <b>payments,</b> <b>loyalty,</b> online ordering, table side ordering by staff and table top ordering by customers. Regarding the payments, mobile POS can accept all kinds of payment methods from contactless cards, EMV chip-enabled cards, and mobile NFC enabled cards. Mobile POS (AKA mPOS) is growing quickly with new developers entering the market almost on a daily basis.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Many recent {{initiatives}} {{indicate an}} evolution to-wards an electronic wallet to perform {{all sorts of}} electronic transactions, such as for example micro <b>payments,</b> <b>loyalty,</b> and transport ticketing. Furthermore, the smartphone is emerging as an indispensable tool for many, containing more and more personal information. Hence, {{it seems like the}} ideal medium for carrying the electronic wallet as well. The fast and intuitive touch-and-go philosophy and the integration in mobile devices, makes Near Field Communication (NFC) the perfect technology for contactless electronic transactions. However, the complex ecosystem is holding back the world-wide integration of this technology in mobile handsets, resulting in a low market penetration of NFC smartphones. In our work, we investigated how an NFC-enabled smartphone can be used as an electronic wallet in an existing solution that originally relied on DESFire tags. We implemented a Java Card applet that is compatible with the DESFire specification and explored how this applet can be deployed on the different possible solutions for the Secure Element (SE), such as an active Bluetooth sticker, a SIM card, and a secure microSD card. Finally, the user-wallet interface was examined carefully, more specifically in terms of accessibility of the wallet content for the different smartphone platforms. Based on the overall experiences and results the final conclusions upon the vision towards an open electronic wallet of the future were drawn.

40|$|Background: Optometric {{practices}} offer {{contact lenses}} as cash sale items or {{as part of}} monthly payment plans. With the contact lens market becoming increasingly competitive, patients are opting to purchase lenses from supermarkets and Internet suppliers. Monthly payment plans are often implemented to improve loyalty. This study aimed to compare behavioural <b>loyalty</b> between monthly <b>payment</b> plan members and non-members. Methods: BBR Optometry Ltd offers a monthly payment plan (Eyelife™) to their contact lens wearers. A retrospective audit of 38 Eyelife™ members (mean. ±. SD: 42. 7. ±. 15. 0 years) and 30 non-members (mean. ±. SD: 40. 8. ±. 16. 7 years) was conducted. Revenue and profits generated, service uptake and product sales between the two groups were compared over a fixed period of 18 months. Results: Eyelife™ members generated significantly higher professional fee revenue (P<. 0. 001), £ 153. 96 compared to £ 83. 50, and profits (P<. 0. 001). Eyelife™ members had a higher uptake of eye examinations (P<. 0. 001). The 2 groups demonstrated no significant difference in spectacle sales by volume (P= 0. 790) or value (P= 0. 369). There were also no significant differences in contact lens revenue (P= 0. 337), although Eyelife™ members did receive a discount. The Eyelife™ group incurred higher contact lens costs (P= 0. 037), due to a greater volume of contact lens purchases, 986 units compared to 582. Conclusions: Monthly <b>payment</b> plans improve <b>loyalty</b> among contact lens wearers, particularly service uptake and volume of lens purchases.
