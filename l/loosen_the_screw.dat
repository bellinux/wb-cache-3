30|$|Many factors {{affect the}} screw preload, {{such as the}} {{coefficient}} of friction between the surface, the elastic modulus of the screw, the geometry of the screw and of the connection, the fit of the components, insertion torque, the presence of lubricant, and occlusal overload [12]. The optimal screw preload should induce a stress in the joint of about 60 – 75 % of the yield strength of the material [20]. There are many methods to measure screw preload [21], removal torque measurement being the most common [22]. The removal torque is the rotational force used to <b>loosen</b> <b>the</b> <b>screw.</b> The greater the preload obtained, the higher is the removal torque value.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Previous {{studies that}} {{evaluated}} the torque needed for removing dental implant screws have not considered {{the manner of}} transfer of the occlusal loads in clinical settings. Instead, the torque used for removal was applied directly to the screw, {{and most of them}} omitted the possibility that the hexagon could limit the action of the occlusal load in the loosening of the screws. The present study proposes a method for evaluating the screw removal torque in an anti-rotational device independent way, creating an unscrewing load transfer to the entire assembly, not only to the screw. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty hexagonal abutments without the hexagon in their bases were fixed with a screw to 20 dental implants. They were divided into two groups: Group 1 used titanium screws and Group 2 used titanium screws covered with a solid lubricant. A torque of 32 Ncm was applied to the screw and then a custom-made wrench was used for rotating the abutment counterclockwise, to <b>loosen</b> <b>the</b> <b>screw.</b> A digital torque meter recorded the torque required to loosen the abutment. RESULTS: There was {{a significant difference between the}} means of Group 1 (38. 62 ± 6. 43 Ncm) and Group 2 (48. 47 ± 5. 04 Ncm), with p= 0. 001. CONCLUSION: This methodology was effective in comparing unscrewing torque values of the implant-abutment junction even with a limited sample size. It confirmed a previously shown significant difference between two types of screws...|$|E

Although now considered obsolete, an advantage of this system is its mechanical simplicity; the degree of damping can be easily adjusted by tightening or <b>loosening</b> <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> clamping <b>the</b> disks, {{and it can be}} easily rebuilt with simple hand tools.

30|$|However, <b>the</b> {{cause to}} <b>loosening</b> pedicle screws {{has not been}} {{sufficiently}} clarified (Mehmanparast et al. 2014). As for <b>the</b> <b>loosening</b> of <b>the</b> <b>screw,</b> Inceoğlu et al. (2008) and Costa et al. (2013) reported that various factors, such as the diameter and material of <b>the</b> <b>screw,</b> or <b>the</b> material and angle of the bone, are involved. Law et al. (1993) and Okuyama et al. (2000) reported that cyclic caudocephalad toggling caused by <b>the</b> craniocaudal <b>screw</b> may be <b>the</b> cause of <b>loosening.</b> We have investigated the biomechanical study and produced the results of weakness of PS fixation under rotational stress, {{and it may be}} <b>the</b> cause of <b>loosening</b> of <b>the</b> <b>screw.</b> In our results, there were significant differences (p <  0.05) in the rotational angles between <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> and <b>the</b> vertebral body for both the L 3 and L 4 vertebral bodies. As far as {{we have been able to}} determine, no biomechanical study has been conducted from the viewpoint of rotational micromovement between <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> and <b>the</b> vertebral body, and this paper may be the first study to confirm that there is rotational micromovement between the vertebral body and <b>the</b> <b>screw.</b> This showed <b>the</b> possibility that occurrence of this rotational micromovement caused repeated friction between the bones and <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> within <b>the</b> living body, which led to <b>loosening</b> of <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> or pullout of PS fixation. For this problem, we suggest some ideas. First, expandable screw are useful, because <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> expand in vertebral body and have large contact area to bone. It is under experiment in our laboratory. Additional fixation like sublaminar wirings and trial of raising bone density are also useful.|$|R

30|$|Tzenakis et al. [42] {{reported}} that retightening of <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> is strongly recommended, but the appropriate timing of retightening {{is still not}} clear. Cho et al.

In our study, the RTVs decreased in the early stage at 50, 000 [*]cycles of loading and then remained constant to 1, 800, 000 [*]cycles. The result can be used to estimate that the implant should also be retightened in the early stage of cyclic loading under a worst-case situation [26]. Seol et al. [37] stated that to minimize <b>screw</b> <b>loosening,</b> <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> should be retightening at 1 [*]month in vivo after constant axial displacement at 100, 000 [*]cycles of loading. Nevertheless, different implant-abutment connections, designs, and materials influence <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> preload differently.
