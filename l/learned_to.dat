A phenomenographic researchapproach was used to reveal variation {{in relation to the}} act of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with students who had either completed,or were recently completing a university level introductory programming subject. Theanalysis process revealed five different ways in which students go about learning toprogram in introductory university level units. These are captured in categories ofdescription which capture the critical dimensions of what students learn as well ashow they go about learning. Students may go about <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program by: • Following – where <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program is experienced as ‘getting through’ the unit. • Coding – where <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program is experienced as <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> code • Understanding and integrating – where <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program is experienced as <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> write a program through understanding and integrating concepts • Problem solving – where <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program is experienced as <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> {{do what it takes to}} solve a problem • Participating or enculturation – where <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program is experienced as discovering what it means to become a programmer The mapping of the variation constitutes a framework within which one aspect of theteaching and learning of introductory programming, how students go about it, may beunderstood.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comprehensive}} empirical exploration of using reinforcement <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> use simple forms of working memory. <b>Learning</b> <b>to</b> use memory involves <b>learning</b> how <b>to</b> behave in the environment while simultaneously <b>learning</b> when <b>to</b> select internal actions that control how knowledge persists in memory and <b>learning</b> how <b>to</b> use that information stored in memory to make decisions. We focus on two different models of memory: bit memory and gated memory. Bit memory is inspired by prior reinforcement learning literature and stores abstract values, which an agent can <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> associate with task history. Gated memory is inspired by human working memory and stores perceptually grounded symbols. Our goal is to determine computational bounds on the tractability of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> use these memories. We conduct a comprehensive empirical exploration {{of the dynamics of}} <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> use memory models by modifying a simple partially observable task, TMaze, along specific dimensions: length of temporal delay, number of dependent decisions, number of distinct symbols, quantity of concurrent knowledge, and availability of second-order knowledge. We find that <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> use gated memory is significantly more tractable than <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> use bit memory because it stores perceptually grounded symbols in memory. We further find that learning performance scales more favorably along temporal delay, distinct symbols, and concurrent knowledge when <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> use gated memory than along other dimensions. We also identify situations in which agents fail <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> use gated memory optimally which involve repeated identical observations which result in no unambiguous trajectories through the underlying task and memory state space...|$|R
