5|$|In 2008, Mayawati launched, Manyawar Shri Kanshiram Ji Shahri Garib Awas Yojna, {{a scheme}} for {{building}} <b>low-cost</b> housing colonies for urban poor with 90,000 <b>low-cost</b> homes {{under the first}} round of construction in different towns and cities across the state while a second and a third round were still underway when government ended in 2012 and next government scrapped the scheme including cutting down electricity of these colonies.|$|E
5|$|In January 1990, Gassée {{resigned}} and his authority over product development was divided among several successors. Many Apple engineers {{had long been}} pressing for lower-cost options {{in order to build}} market share and increase demand across the entire price spectrum. With Gassée out, a rush started to quickly introduce a series of <b>low-cost</b> machines. Three market points were identified, a very <b>low-cost</b> machine aimed at costing $1,000, a <b>low-cost</b> machine with color graphics, and a more upscale color machine for small business use. In time, these would develop as the Classic, Macintosh LC, and Macintosh IIsi. Unlike the '020 and '030 based models, the Macintosh Classic has the original Macintosh startup sound.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, IndiGo was the second-fastest-growing <b>low-cost</b> carrier in Asia behind Indonesian airline Lion Air. In February 2013, {{following}} {{the announcement of}} the civil aviation ministry that it would allow IndiGo to take delivery of only five aircraft that year, the airline planned to introduce <b>low-cost</b> regional flights by setting up a subsidiary. Later, IndiGo announced that it planned to seek permission from the ministry to acquire four more aircraft, therefore taking delivery of nine aircraft in 2013. As of March 2014, IndiGo is the second-largest <b>low-cost</b> carrier in Asia in terms of seats flown.|$|E

5|$|There was {{an influx}} of {{refugees}} due to <b>low-cost</b> housing in the Sunnyslope area in the 1990s, resulting in 43 different languages being spoken in local schools by the year 2000. The new 20-story City Hall opened in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his {{parliamentary}} career, Dacey {{campaigned for}} a garden suburb which would provide government-owned, <b>low-cost</b> housing {{to the working}} class. After his death, the garden suburb of Daceyville was built in Sydney and named in honour of him.|$|E
5|$|After a broad {{review of}} its {{tactical}} force structure, the U.S. Air Force decided {{to adopt a}} <b>low-cost</b> aircraft to supplement the F-4 and F-111. It first focused on the Northrop F-5, which had air-to-air capability. A 1965 cost-effectiveness study shifted the focus from the F-5 to the less expensive LTV A-7D, and a contract was awarded. However, this aircraft doubled in cost with demands for an upgraded engine and new avionics.|$|E
5|$|Eglin steel uses a {{combination}} of over a dozen different elements in varying amounts to create a relatively <b>low-cost</b> steel for use in bunker buster weapons. Hadfield steel (after Sir Robert Hadfield) or manganese steel contains 12–14% manganese which when abraded strain-hardens to form an incredibly hard skin which resists wearing. Examples include tank tracks, bulldozer blade edges and cutting blades on the jaws of life.|$|E
5|$|Eight Chinook HC Mk3s {{were ordered}} in 1995 as {{dedicated}} special forces helicopters, which {{were intended to}} be <b>low-cost</b> variants of the US Army's MH-47E. The Mk3s include improved range, night vision sensors and navigation capability. The eight aircraft were to cost £259million and the forecast in-service date was November 1998. Although delivered in 2001, the Mk3 could not receive airworthiness certificates as {{it was not possible}} to certify the avionics software.|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, Olav Nils Sunde {{announced}} that he would establish a <b>low-cost</b> airline following the opening of the new airport. The company would be led by CEO Morten Andersen, who previously had been CEO of Norway Airlines, and the lawyer Stein Øxseth.

The company launched tickets down to NOK 500 each way, and sold cheap tickets without demanding that the traveler be away during a weekend.|$|E
5|$|In mid 2015, Lion Air rules Indonesia's {{domestic}} {{air travel}} market share by 41.6 percent, while Garuda Indonesia came in second with 23.5 percent share. Sriwijaya Air came in third with a market share of 10.4 percent, followed by Garuda's <b>low-cost</b> subsidiary Citilink (8.9 percent) and Lion Air's short-haul subsidiary Wings Air (4.7 percent). Indonesia AirAsia, {{a unit of the}} Malaysian budget airline, had a 4.4 percent market share.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, NASA {{initiated}} the Discovery Program, which {{was intended to}} be a series of <b>low-cost</b> scientific missions. In 1996, the program's study team recommended a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine as a high priority. Funding for this program remained problematic for several years, but by 2004 the Dawn vehicle had passed its critical design review and construction proceeded.|$|E
5|$|LeMond founded LeMond Composites in 2016 to {{manufacture}} high-volume, <b>low-cost</b> carbon fiber composites under a licensing {{agreement with the}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory and an exclusive 20-year licensing agreement with Deakin University. LeMond and his family moved from Minnesota to Oak Ridge, Tennessee {{to be close to}} the $125 million LeMond Composites manufacturing facility.|$|E
5|$|Other economists {{argue that}} no matter how much Greece and Portugal drive down their wages, they could never compete with <b>low-cost</b> {{developing}} countries such as China or India. Instead weak European countries must shift their economies to higher quality products and services, though this is a long-term process and may not bring immediate relief.|$|E
5|$|Seven shorter NoL Eurostar trains {{for these}} Regional Eurostar {{services}} were built, but these services never ran. Predicted journey times of almost nine hours for Glasgow to Paris {{at the time}} of growth of <b>low-cost</b> air travel during the 1990s made the plans commercially unviable against the cheaper and quicker airlines. Other reasons that have been suggested for these services having never been run were both government policies and the disruptive privatisation of British Rail.|$|E
5|$|Silicon-germanium alloys {{are rapidly}} {{becoming}} an important semiconductor material for high-speed integrated circuits. Circuits utilizing {{the properties of}} Si-SiGe junctions can be much faster than those using silicon alone. Silicon-germanium is beginning to replace gallium arsenide (GaAs) in wireless communications devices. The SiGe chips, with high-speed properties, {{can be made with}} <b>low-cost,</b> well-established production techniques of the silicon chip industry.|$|E
5|$|Since its founding, the Knights of Columbus {{has been}} {{involved}} in evangelization. In 1948, the Knights started the Catholic Information Service (CIS) to provide <b>low-cost</b> Catholic publications for the general public as well as for parishes, schools, retreat houses, military installations, correctional facilities, legislatures, the medical community, and for individuals who request them. Since then, CIS has printed millions of booklets, and thousands of people have enrolled in CIS correspondence and on-line courses.|$|E
5|$|SpiceJet is a <b>low-cost</b> airline {{headquartered}} in Gurugram, India. It {{is the third}} largest airline in the country by number of domestic passengers carried, with a market share of 14.2% as of July 2017.

5|$|The {{design for}} Chaoyong was advertised by its designer, British naval {{architect}} Sir George Wightwick Rendel, {{as an example}} of a <b>low-cost</b> cruiser able to withstand larger ironclad warships. The design was later seen as an intermediate concept between his flat-iron gunboats and the protected cruiser. In theory, the ship would rely on its small size and higher speed, along with a higher muzzle velocity main battery to attack larger, less maneuverable ships.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} current problems in Indonesian aviation are poor development {{and maintenance of}} air transportation infrastructure, especially in remote areas. Other significant problems include overcapacity; the massive surge of air travelers in recent years, prompted by the growth of <b>low-cost</b> carrier passengers, has put intense stress on the aging airport infrastructure in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Vasan Healthcare, {{a rapidly}} growing {{healthcare}} chain, is based in Tiruchirappalli. Tiruchirappalli has 29 nursing homes approved by the Department of Health and Family Welfare.

Tiruchirappalli is a hub for <b>low-cost</b> medical tourism in central Tamil Nadu.|$|E
5|$|Among other factors, {{the growth}} of <b>low-cost</b> airline flights to Bratislava, led by Ryanair, has led to {{conspicuous}} stag parties, primarily from the UK. While these are a boom to the city's tourism industry, cultural differences and vandalism have led to concern by local officials. Reflecting the popularity of rowdy parties in Bratislava {{in the early to}} mid-2000s, the city was a setting in the 2004 comedy film Eurotrip, which was actually filmed in the city and suburbs of Prague, the Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy, such as in {{high-temperature}} molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are <b>low-cost,</b> have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44TJ in its 68m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E
5|$|Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, near Dania Beach, Florida, is the city's main {{airport and}} is the {{fastest-growing}} major airport in the country. This is, in part, attributable to service by <b>low-cost</b> carriers such as Spirit Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and Virgin America, resulting in lower airfares than nearby Miami International Airport. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood is an emerging international gateway for the Caribbean and Latin America. Miami International Airport and Palm Beach International Airport also serve the city.|$|E

5|$|<b>Low-cost</b> {{loans for}} farmers and {{replaced}} the labor service {{with a tax}} instead, hoping this would ultimately help {{the workings of the}} entire economy and state (as he directly linked state income to the level of prosperity of rural peasants who owned farms, produced goods for the market, and paid the land tax). These government loans replaced the system of landlords offering their tenants private loans, which was prohibited under the new laws of Wang's reforms.|$|E
5|$|The puffball bioaccumulates {{heavy metals}} {{present in the}} soil, {{and can be used}} as a {{bioindicator}} of soil pollution by heavy metals and selenium. In one 1977 study, samples collected from grassy areas near the side of an interstate highway in Connecticut were shown to have high concentrations of cadmium and lead. L.perlatum biomass has been shown experimentally to remove mercury ions from aqueous solutions, and is being investigated for potential use as a <b>low-cost,</b> renewable, biosorptive material in the treatment of water and wastewater containing mercury.|$|E
