The in vitro effect on spermatozoa was also tested. A total of 100 multiparous female rabbits were divided into 5 groups, which {{at the moment of}} AI, received 0. 2 mL (5 μg/dose) intramuscular (im) inoculation of <b>Lecirelin</b> (control) or the same <b>Lecirelin</b> dose administered intravaginally (iv) with the seminal dose alone (<b>Lecirelin</b> group) or with benzilic alcohol (<b>Lecirelin</b> BA group), benzoic acid (<b>Lecirelin</b> BAc group) or parabens (<b>Lecirelin</b> PA group) as an excipient. After 7 days, 10 rabbits per group were euthanized to analyze their ovarian status. In the control group, a high LH peak was detected 30 min post AI, while in the iv groups a slight increase in LH occurred after 120 min. The ovulation and fertility rate was similar in control and <b>Lecirelin</b> groups, while the lowest fertility rate was detected in the <b>Lecirelin</b> BA group. In a second experiment, the semen samples collected from male rabbits were diluted in TALP (control) or mixed with the 5 μg of <b>Lecirelin</b> solutions used in the first experiment. The highest percentage of capacitated sperm (68. 3 %) was recorded in the <b>Lecirelin</b> PA. The lowest percentages were observed in the <b>Lecirelin</b> BA and BAc groups. In conclusion, the iv administration of <b>Lecirelin</b> represents an alternative method for simplifying rabbit insemination procedures...|$|E

The in vitro evaluation of the spontaneous basal contractility of bovine preovulatory and cystic follicles was performed, followed by testing the effects of <b>lecirelin,</b> a GnRH analogue, on their basal contractility.

40|$|Bovine {{follicular}} cysts (FCs) are {{a common}} cause of economic loss in modern dairy herds. Their aetiopathogenesis is not completely understood, even though an inadequate hypothalamic release of GnRH {{at the time of}} ovulation is considered to be their main cause. Much evidence, however, suggests a role for adrenergic innervation in ovarian functions, such as follicular development, steroid hormone secretion, and follicular contractility, the latter being an event important for ovulation. Moreover, in humans, polycystic ovary syndrome, a disease very similar to bovine follicular cysts, is characterised by increased density of adrenergic nerves. Given these premises, the aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness and mode of action of a novel strategy for the treatment of bovine follicular cysts. In the in vivo experiment, 170 Friesian cows diagnosed with follicular cysts were assigned to four groups (groups A, B, C, and D) to assess the effects of epidural administration of a β-adrenergic antagonist (carazolol) alone or in combination with a GnRH analogue (<b>lecirelin).</b> The four groups underwent the following treatments: Group A was administered <b>lecirelin</b> in combination with carazolol; Group B was administered carazolol; Group C was administered lecirelin; and Group D was administered only normal saline solution. In the in vitro experiment, strips of the walls of cystic follicles recovered post-mortem were suspended in an organ bath, connected to an isometric force transducer and exposed to increasing doses of epinephrine or to the same treatment after exposure to carazolol for 15 min (n = 10). The amplitude and frequency of the contractile activity were recorded. None of the control cows was observed in oestrus or was submitted to AI. The combination of <b>lecirelin</b> and carazolol induced {{a significant increase in the}} number of cows in oestrus (88 %) compared to <b>lecirelin</b> alone or to carazolol alone (P < 0. 05 and P < 0. 01, respectively). The combination of <b>lecirelin</b> and carazolol and <b>lecirelin</b> alone were significantly more efficacious than carazolol alone (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05, respectively). In the in vitro experiment, epinephrine increased the amplitude of the contractions of the strips in a dose-dependent manner. This response was significantly enhanced in strips pre-treated with carazolol. The treatments had no effect on the frequency of contractions. In conclusion, our work demonstrates that the epidural administration of a GnRH analogue and a β-adrenergic blocker is an effective means of treating cows with cystic ovarian disease. Moreover, it confirms, from a clinical point of view, that alterations of the adrenergic system and of the contractility of the follicular wall can be considered aetiopathogenic factors involved in the development of FCs. The results of this study lay the basis for a new therapeutic approach to FCs...|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{follicular}} cysts are an ovarian {{disorder of}} dairy cows associated with abnormal estrous behaviour and infertility. The {{treatment of choice}} is intramuscular administration of a GnRH analogue, which acts by triggering pituitary release of LH. However, the presence of GnRH and GnRH receptors on spinal cord and ovary in some species, {{and the kind of}} innervation of the ovary, let us hypothesize that GnRH and its analogues may also act when administered by epidural route, as happens for other drugs. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} compare the effects of epidural vs intramuscular administration of <b>lecirelin</b> (a GnRH analogue) on FC regression, estrus detection and pregnancy outcomes. The study was conducted on 220 Friesian cows affected by follicular cysts, divided among 4 groups: Group Lepid and Group Lim received, respectively 50 μg of <b>lecirelin</b> in the epidural space and intramuscular; Group Cepid and Group Cim were used as control groups. In Group Lepid, estrus induction and pregnancy rates were significantly higher than in Group Lim. The results of this study show that the epidural administration of <b>lecirelin</b> promoted the remission of follicular cysts and an improvement of reproductive parameters compared to intramuscular administration. Thus, an alternative therapeutical approach is available for FC treatment, in order to obtain an easier restoration of the ovarian activity, especially in those cases refractory to classical therapeutic approaches...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the LH surge after last hormonal injection of synchronization of ovulation protocols in buffalo. Fifteen multiparous buffaloes received 25 mg of <b>Lecirelin</b> in Day 0, and 150 mg of D-Cloprostenol on Day 7. On Day 8, estradiol benzoate was injected in Group 1 (0. 5 mg, n = 5) and Group 2 (1. 0 mg, n = 5). On Day 9, five buffaloes received 25 mg of <b>Lecirelin</b> (Control). Blood samples were collected for measure the LH concentrations on Day 7 and then every 3 hours until 72 hours after the PGF 2 a injection. For evaluation of LH surge were compared the interval between PGF 2 a injection to LH surge, duration, amplitude and area under the LH peak. The LH surge occurred 51. 0 + 0. 0 hours, 47. 3 + 2. 7 hours and 47. 0 + 3. 8 hours after PGF 2 a injection for Control, Group 1 and Group 2, respectively (P > 0. 05). The duration of LH peak in Control (7. 8 + 1. 5 hours) was shorter than Groups 1 and 2 (10. 5 + 1. 5 hours vs. 10. 8 + 2. 4 hours, respectively; P 0. 05). The area under LH peak for Control (4. 8 ± 0. 7) was smaller than the areas of the Groups 1 and 2 (8. 8 ± 2. 5 vs. 8. 7 2. 2, respectively; P < 0. 05).

40|$|Equine {{chorionic}} gonadotropin (eCG) is secreted {{by specific}} areas of the chorion of the equine placenta, i. e., the endometrial cups, from the 36 th up to the 140 th day of pregnancy. ECG plays an FSH- and LH-like activity, with prevalence of the latter in equine species and of the former in other livestock. This hormone has been widely used to enhance follicle growth in estrus synchronization and superovulatory regimes. We evaluated the effect of eCG on pregnancy rate in buffalo cows which were submitted to a regime for timed artificial insemination (TAI). During the interruption of sexual promiscuity outside the breeding season, from January to February, 80 buffalo cows, reared on one farm in the Salerno district, were submitted to gynaecological examination by rectal palpation in order to select animals with an empty, disease-free genital tract. These animals were separated into two groups (n= 47 and 33) which were submitted to TAI 20 days apart. Each group was further subdivided into control and eCG-treated groups. All the animals received a first dose of GnRH, i. e., 50 ug <b>lecirelin</b> acetate, which marked day- 0 of the treatment. After 7 days, a PGF 2  treatment, i. e., 150 ug D-cloprostenol, was administered and 2 days later all the animals received another 50 ug <b>lecirelin</b> acetate dose. Two dosages of eCG (Ciclogonina, Fort Dodge Animal Health), i. e., 400 vs 800 IU, were administered {{at the time of}} PGF 2 -induced luteolysis in the eCG treated subgroups of the first and the second experimental period, respectively. Approximately 17 and 41 hours after the last GnRH injection, all the animals were artificially inseminated twice with frozen/thawed semen of two buffalo bulls. The animals were homogeneously distributed within groups, i. e., treated vs control and bull 1 vs bull 2, in relation to age, parity and number of days open. Pregnancy was diagnosed by rectal palpation after 50 days post-TAI. Statistical analysis was performed by the Yates’ Chi square test.

40|$|Luteal dysfunctions, e. g., {{premature}} luteolysis and {{corpus luteum}} with low progesterone secretion, are common causes of reproductive failure in cattle. They {{may be due}} to: (1) inadequate growth of the preovulatory follicle; (2) decrease in luteotropic aids; and (3) premature luteolysis. Both non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (FANS) and GnRH agonists have been successfully used at different times post-insemination {{in order to support}} luteal activity by either preventing PGF 2 α release or developing a supplementary corpus luteum, respectively. This study is aimed at evaluating the effect of the two treatments affecting luteal activity on artificial insemination efficiency in bovine and buffalo cows. A GnRH agonist, buserelin (20 μg/head), and a FANS, ketoprofen (1. 5 g/head), were administered 10 -d post-insemination in bovine and buffalo cows. Bovine cows were reared on three farms and, when ready to breed, artificially inseminated at spontaneous estrus and, 10 -d later, randomly submitted to these two treatments or used as control. Bovine bulls were chosen in relation to breeding schedules previously arranged on each farm and randomly distributed within groups. Buffalo cows, which were separated from bulls two months earlier and diagnosed empty and free from evident reproductive disorders, were divided into three homogeneous groups in relation to age, parity and days open, and submitted to fixed time insemination through two replicates 20 -d apart. Briefly, an agonist of GnRH, <b>lecirelin</b> (50 μg/head), was first administered; after 7 days these animals received 150 μg D-cloprostenol/head and, two days later, again 50 μg lecirelin/head. Buffaloes were artificially inseminated after 17 hours and again 41 hours after the last <b>lecirelin</b> treatment. Two buffalo bulls were used in each replicate. Pregnancy was evaluated by rectal palpation on 50 -d post-insemination. Data were analyzed by ANOVA after arcsine transformation of percentage values. A preliminary analysis of data found a homogeneous distribution of both bovine and buffalo cows within groups in relation to age, parity and days open. In buffalo, the bull effect did not significantly affect results. In bovine, a total number of 15 different bulls were used randomly distributed among groups and farms, and the bull effect was negligible.

Primeiramente, um grupo de 10 fêmeas foi avaliado para determinação de seu status reprodutivo, por meio da mensuração das concentrações séricas de estradiol e progesterona (coletas de sangue 3 x/semana); da observação do comportamento reprodutivo; da determinação do desenvolvimento ovariano por exame ultrassonográfico (a cada 21 dias); e pela postura de ovos. Após o término desta primeira fase, as fêmeas foram separadas em grupo controle (n = 3) e grupo tratado (n = 6). A cada semana, 2 fêmeas do grupo tratado eram selecionadas para a aplicação intramuscular de 1 ml (25 &# 956;l) de lecirelina, e os seus efeitos avaliados pela análise das concentrações séricas de estradiol, progesterona e corticosterona (0 h, 6 h, 24 h, 48 h e 96 h pós-aplicação); pela verificação do desenvolvimento ovariano e ocorrência de ovulação através de exames ultrassonográficos (24 h, 48 h e 96 h); pela observação de comportamento reprodutivo (0 h, 48 h e 96 h) e pela postura de ovos. O tratamento foi repetido no mesmo animal a cada 21 dias e em cada tratamento realizado, 2 fêmeas do grupo controle eram submetidas às mesmas análises. Os resultados indicam que a aplicação de lecirelina foi capaz de induzir a ovulação em 77 % dos tratamentos realizados, com postura de ovos normais em 50 % das induções. Assim, o tratamento proposto foi considerado eficiente na indução da ovulação em fêmeas de avestruz desde que seja aplicado em fêmeas que apresentem ovário bem desenvolvido.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of the application of an analog of GnRH (<b>Lecirelin</b> - Gestran Plus®) for induction of ovulation in adult female ostriches. Initially, a group of 10 adult female ostriches were evaluated in order to determine their reproductive status, by measuring serum levels of estradiol and progesterone (blood sampling - 3 times a week), by the observation of reproductive behavior, by the evaluation of the ovarian development through ultrasound examination (repeated every 21 days) and by the egg laying data. After the end of the first phase, female ostriches were separated into a control group (n = 3) and a treated group (n = 6). Every week, two females from the treated group were selected to receive the treatment: an intramuscular application of 1 ml (25 &# 956;l) of <b>Lecirelin.</b> The effect of the application was evaluated by the analysis of serum concentrations of estradiol, progesterone and corticosterone (0 h, 6 h, 24 h, 48 h and 96 h post-application), by the verification of the ovarian development and the occurrence of ovulation through ultrasound examinations (24 h, 48 h and 96 h), by the observation of reproductive behavior (0 h, 48 h and 96 h) and by the egg laying data. The intramuscular application was repeated in the same animal every 21 days and two females from the control group were subjected to the same analysis during each treatment. The results indicate that the application of <b>Lecirelin</b> was able to induce ovulation in 77 % of the treatments with normal egg laying in 50 % of inductions.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of administration of a GnRH analogue to cows with ovarian follicular cysts on plasma renin concentrations and ovarian vascularization. This study was performed with 60 Friesian cows, which were diagnosed with follicular cysts, and randomly allocated into two groups: group A (treatment; n = 30) received 2 ml of <b>lecirelin</b> (Dalmarelin® - Fatro), per head via sacro-coccygeal epidural, and group B (control; n = 30) received 2 ml saline solution (0. 9 % NaCl) per head by the same route. Blood samples were immediately collected prior to administration (T 0) and then 24 h (T 1), 48 h (T 2) and 8 days (T 3) after administration of the treatment, for both groups. Ovarian vascularization was evaluated utilizing Power Doppler on these same days in 10 animals from each group. The number of pixels detected by Power Doppler was used as an indicator of the degree of vascularization. Plasma renin concentrations remained relatively constant for the control (group B) animals, but increased as the sampling period progressed (NS) for the treated cows (group A). Similarly, there were no changes in ovarian vascularization (number of pixels) for the control cows, but vascularization increased throughout the sampling period in the treated animals. The number of pixels associated with cysts was significantly higher for treated compared to control cows at 24 h after treatment (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} investigate the administration of intravaginal progesterone in protocols for oestrus and ovulation synchronization in beef heifers. In Experiment 1, cyclic Black Angus heifers (n = 20) received an Ovsynch protocol and {{were randomly assigned to}} receive (CIDR-Ovsynch) or not (Ovsynch) a progesterone device between Days 0 and 7. Treatment with a controlled internal drug release (CIDR) device significantly increased the size of the dominant follicle prior to ovulation (12. 8 ± 0. 4 CIDR-Ovsynch vs 11. 4 ± 0. 4 Ovsynch) (p < 0. 02). Plasma progesterone concentrations throughout the experiment were affected by the interaction between group and day effects (p < 0. 004). In Experiment 2, cyclic Polled Hereford heifers (n = 382) were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the six treatment groups (3 × 2 factorial design) to receive a CIDR, a used bovine intravaginal device (DIB), or a medroxiprogesterone acetate (MAP) sponge and GnRH analogues (<b>lecirelin</b> or buserelin). All heifers received oestradiol benzoate plus one of the devices on Day 0 and PGF on Day 7 pm (device withdrawal). Heifers were detected in oestrus 36 h after PGF and inseminated 8 – 12 h later, while the remainder received GnRH 48 h after PGF and were inseminated on Day 10 (60 h). The number of heifers detected in oestrus on Day 8 and conception rate to AI on Day 9 were higher (p < 0. 01) in the used-DIB than in the CIDR or MAP groups, while the opposite occurred with the pregnancy rate to FTAI on Day 10 (p < 0. 01). There was no effect of progesterone source, GnRH analogue or their interaction on overall pregnancy rates (64. 9 %).

40|$|Background: In buffaloes, delayed puberty, {{seasonality}} of calving, long postpartum anoestrus, {{weakness of}} oestrus signs, low conception rate and long calving intervals greatly affect the reproductive efficiency. Artificial insemination (AI) has proved {{as the most}} important tool for genetic improvement in dairy cattle. However, its use in buffalo is very low due to poor conception rates achieved through AI especially with frozen semen. In order to improve reproductive capability, {{there is a need to}} focus on understanding reproductive endocrinology of buffalo to develop methods for controlled breeding. The present study was designed to monitor the effect of the Ovsynch treatment on plasma LH and progesterone (P 4) levels during peak and low breeding seasons of the dairy buffaloes. Secondly conception rate was studied in buffaloes after treatment with oestrus synchronization protocols (CIDR vs Ovsynch) during low and peak breeding seasons under controlled condition and under field conditions with farmers. Materials and MethodsTwelve Nili Ravi buffaloes were treated with the Ovsynch protocol in November and December of 2007 (i. e. the peak breeding season of buffalo). The buffaloes used for heat synchronization during peak breeding season were kept non pregnant and same were used for studying the effect of the Ovsynch during low breeding season (May 2008). Heat detection was continued in these animals to determine their cyclic status from peak into low breeding season. In the Ovsynch protocol, buffaloes were administered GnRH analogue (50 Ã¬g <b>lecirelin)</b> (day 0) followed by prostaglandinF 2 Ã¡ (PGF 2 Ã¡) analogue (150 Ã¬g cloprostenol, day 7) and again GnRH analogue (day 9). Blood sampling for P 4, was done on day 0, 4, 7, 11 and then once weekly for 8 weeks. For LH, sampling was started 12 h after PGF 2 Ã¡ injection at 3 h interval up to 108 h. At each occasion 10 ml blood was collected in a heparinized vial. For the frequent sampling for LH an intravenous catheter was placed in jugular vein. Blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 3000 rpm (1006 g) for 15 min. Plasma was stored at - 20 Â°C until analyzed. LH was determined by using an ELISA LH DETECTÂ® specific for buffaloes. The assay was a sandwich type assay using two polyclonal antibodies produced from the same antigen, buffalo LH. Plasma P 4 was estimated by using commercial ELISA kit. Assays for each sample were conducted in duplicate. For fertility trial the Ovsynch treatment was applied and timed AI was done at 12 hour and again at 24 hour after 2 nd GnRH. In CIDR (Controlled Internal Drug Release device) treatment EAZI BREED CIDR was inserted into vagina (day 0) followed by PGF 2 Ã¡ analogue (day 6). CIDR was removed on day 8 and buffaloes were artificially inseminated at 24 and 36 hours post CIDR removal. Pregnancy test in buffaloes was performed via palpation per rectum 45 days after insemination. Animals repeating/showing spontaneous heatâ€™ 21 to 42 days after timed AI were inseminated again. Fertility under controlled conditions were performed during May, 2009 for low breeding season and in December 2009 for peak breeding season. Number of animals used during low breeding season in the controlled study was 9 (Ovsynch), 10 (CIDR), and 4 (Control) and number of animals used during peak breeding season was 10 (Ovsynch), 11 (CIDR), and 4 (Control). Control animals were given no treatment but were watched for oestrus and were inseminated if found in heat. Since CIDR protocol worked better than the Ovsynch protocol for oestrus induction during low breeding season in buffaloes, CIDR was used for oestrus induction under field condition (n = 20) during May 2010. Similarly the Ovsynch protocol was applied during peak breeding season (n = 24) in December 2010. Inseminations in all the animals were performed using freshly collected chilled semen diluted in skim milk. Results LH peak was noted at 39 h after PGF 2 Ã¡ in all the animals in which blood sampling could be accomplished during peak breeding season, however, 87. 5 % animals were considered as responsive when progesterone levels were taken into account. The range of LH peak was 4. 43 - 19. 37 ng/ml with a mean Â± SEM of 10. 38 Â± 5. 54 ng/ml during peak breeding season. Over low breeding season 63. 6 % buffaloes became acyclic and 36. 4 % buffaloes responded to the Ovsynch protocol during low breeding season. Only 14. 3 % buffaloes with ceased heat activity responded to the Ovsynch protocol during low breeding season. The range of LH peak during low breeding season was 4. 42 - 13. 60 ng/ml with a mean Â± SEM of 7. 38 Â± 3. 74 ng/ml. A significantly higher number of buffaloes responded to the Ovsynch protocol duringpeak breeding (87. 5 %) season as compared to animals in low breeding season (36. 4 %) (P< 0. 05). Under controlled conditions the Ovsynch proved to be a better management tool during peak breeding season when 70. 0 % buffaloes became pregnant after the treatment. However, CIDR worked better during low breeding season where 30 % conception rate was achieved as compared to the Ovsynch (0. 0 %.). When these results obtained from controlled conditions were applied at farmerâ€™s level then a conception rate of 52. 6 % was achieved with CIDR in low breeding season and 66. 7 % with the Ovsynch during peak breeding season. Conclusion: In the light of progesterone and LH analyses it was observed that the Ovsynch worked better during peak breeding season as compared to low breeding season. The Ovsynch and CIDR protocols both were found effective for oestrus synchronization and fertility in buffaloes during peak breeding season, however, only CIDR was able to induce fertile heat in a portion of buffaloes during low breeding season, whereas, the Ovsynch was unable to induce fertile heat during low breeding season. From this study it was recommended that CIDR can be effectively used in both season...|$|E
