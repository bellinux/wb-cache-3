Surface finish has a vital influence on functional properties such as wear resistance and power loss due to friction {{on most of the}} engineering components. Voltage, mesh number, revolutions per minute (rpm) of electromagnet, and percentage weight of abrasives has been identified as important process parameters affecting surface roughness. The experiments were planned using response surface methodology and percentage change in surface roughness (ΔRa) was considered as response. Analysis of experimental data showed that percentage change in surface roughness (ΔRa) was highly influenced by mesh number followed by percentage weight of abrasives, rpm of electromagnet, and voltage. The process has been investigated extensively in the finishing of cylindrical surfaces. The surface finish was found to improve significantly with an increase in the grain size, relative size of abrasive particles vis-à-vis the iron particles, feed rate and current. Super finishing is a micro-finishing process that produces a controlled and smooth surface condition on work pieces. It is not primarily a sizing operation, its major purpose is to produce a surface on a work piece capable of sustaining uneven distribution of a load by improving the geometrical accuracy. The wear life of the parts micro finished to maximum smoothness is extended considerably. According to the design of experimentation, mathematical model for <b>Lapping</b> <b>operation</b> on advance ceramic material is proposed. In order to get minimum values of the surface roughness, optimization of the mathematical model is done and optimal operation of the examined factors is going to be determined. The obtained results will be, according to the experiment plan, valid for the testing of ceramic material by <b>Lapping</b> <b>operation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Automobiles {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of our daily life as more and more mopeds, motor cycles, cars, trucks, busses and trains are being used for transport. The main parts of an automotive engine are cylinder, piston assembly, connecting rod and crank shaft. The piston assembly consists of Piston, Piston rings and Piston Pin. Piston rings are important parts of a piston assembly. Any non-conformance in any quality characteristic of the piston ring leads to deterioration of engine performance. M/S Goetze (India) Limited a medium scale industry and a sister concern of engineering giant M/S Escorts Limited is manufacturing "GOETZE PISTON RINGS" and is producing about 800 varieties of piston rings ranging from 35. 00 mm to 228. 5 mm nominal diameter. The management was facing serious problem due to high scrap rate in certain types of their manufactured piston rings. Hence instead of trying to handle all of them at the same time, it seemed reasonable to tackle and find a suitable approach to solve the quality problem by taking the most notorious ring first, so that once the methodology is understood, documented and applied to the quality problem of this ring, the same can also be invoked for other rings to improve upon their quality, and thus reducing the scrap rate. One particular ring of 83. 0 mm diameter which is delicate and costly, having an average scrap rate of 36. 2 % in past three years is selected for the study. No systematic effort was made in the past to identify the quality characteristics and the processes which were responsible for this high scrap rate and thus no immediate measure could be recommended. As a matter of fact at the beginning of the study it was not even clear which quality characteristics were mainly responsible for such high rejection. So in July' 1999 a pareto analysis was done for the first time to identify the culpability of each quality characteristic for the rejection of the ring. From the Pareto analysis it was observed that maximum proportion of rejection was due to nonconformity in axial thickness. The scrap rate due to nonconformity in axial thickness were collected for each month from Jul’ 999 to Jan' 2000 which averaged at 8. 7 %. Since in every month the major malefactor for rejection was the nonconformity of axial thickness it was decided to first try to improve the quality of axial thickness, before trying to tackle other quality issues associated with this particular piston ring under study. Once the most problematic quality characteristic namely the axial thickness was identified, as a first step towards the goal of improving the quality of axial thickness, it was necessary to pay attention and isolate the manufacturing processes or operations affecting the axial thickness and study them in detail. So first, the entire manufacturing process flow diagram of the piston ring was studied. From the process flow diagram it appeared that there are 4 operations affecting axial thickness viz. Rough Grinding,Medium Grinding, First Lapping and Finish Lapping. So each of these processes was critically observed to assess whether they were under statistical control or not. Studies were conducted at each of these 4 operations by collecting samples using the rational subgroup method and control charts were plotted. From the control charts, it was observed that the Rough Grinding and Medium Grinding operations were in statistical control with acceptable Cp, Cpk values. But First Lapping and Finish Lapping operations were not in statistical control. Thus we finally identified the two critical processes namely the First Lapping and Finish Lapping operations which were not in statistical control but were crucially affecting the quality of axial thickness. Since the First and Finish Lapping operations were identified as the major source of the quality problem, an in-depth study was undertaken to analyze these two processes. A brain storming session was conducted with all concerned personnel from production, maintenance, design, quality assurance and tool room to get all possible causes which might be affecting the axial thickness variation at these two processes. During the brain storming session the team suggested that the First Lapping process can be processed in medium grinding machine (DFS machine) instead of Lapping machine. The reasons behind this were two fold. First since the aim of the First Lapping is just to remove excess material which was deposited during chrome plating, the same operation can be performed in DFS machine. Since the required surface finish on axial surface was any way being aimed at the Finish <b>Lapping</b> <b>operation,</b> a similar precursory First Lapping'operation in a Lapping machine was really felt not necessary. Secondly since the performance of the DFS machine was found to be under control, albeit for the grinding operation, it was hoped that the <b>Lapping</b> <b>operation</b> in the same machine would also exhibit a similar performance. For this purpose a study was conducted on the First <b>Lapping</b> <b>operation</b> with the DFS machine. It was found that the process was well within the control limit with decent Cp and Cpk values. Thus this procedure of performing the First <b>Lapping</b> <b>operation</b> in a DFS machine took care of the first one of the two problematic processes affecting the quality of axial thickness. Next for tackling the problem with the other critical process, viz. the Finish <b>Lapping</b> <b>operation,</b> various causes were suggested by the team for axial thickness variation in the Finish <b>Lapping</b> <b>operation.</b> Based on these causes, an Ishikawa diagram (cause and effect diagram) was prepared. This Ishikawa diagram had thrown light into number of possible deficiencies in Man, Machine, Method and Material which were responsible for axial thickness variation at finish Lapping. The Ishikawa diagram was carefully analyzed. The causes were narrowed down to 6 factors. These are Grinding wheel rotating speed, Grinding Time, Grinding pressure, Holding plate, Holes (fixtures) within the holding plate and Positions within a ring. The 3 factors namely grinding wheel speed, time and pressure were identified as the control factors. Holding plate, Hole position within a plate and Checking position within a ring on the other hand were the noise factors whose different levels might exhibit a variability of axial thickness. Since there were only 3 control factors, it was decided to conduct a full factorial experiment with each control factor at 3 levels. Hence altogether there were 27 experiments at a fixed given combination of speed, time and pressure. There were 4 holding plates with each plate having 6 slotted holes leading to machining 24 rings at a time during the finish <b>lapping</b> <b>operation.</b> Next 3 measurements were taken for each one of these 24 rings. Thus altogether there were 72 observations for one of these experiments. Each experiment was replicated twice by taking measurements for 2 consecutive batches of rings. From the analysis of variance of the results of these experiments for both S/N ratio and mean it was observed that all the three main factors and their interactions were significant. The Normality assumption of standardized residuals for the S/N ratio and mean was validated by normal probability plot and Kolmonogorov-Smirnoff test. The homoscedasticity assumption was validated through Bartlett’s test and residual plots. It was found that the experiment no. 23 (Speed 84 RPM, Time 10 sees and Pressure 300 daN) yielded highest S/N ratio (η) with mean within the specification limit. That the mean and S/N ratio for the experiment no. 23 were significantly different from others was established by means of Tukey's multiple comparison test. Next control charts for experiment no. 23 were plotted and was found to be well within control with acceptable Cp and Cpk values. Hence we concluded that the non-conformance in axial thickness can be substantially reduced by using the following optimal setting of factors i. e. grinding speed with 84 RPM, grinding pressure with 300 daN and grinding time with 10 seconds. Using this optimal setting the earlier average rejection rate of 8. 7 % due to non-conformance in axial thickness was reduced to 0. 05 %. Under this optimal setting, the process capability index (Cpk) of finish <b>Lapping</b> <b>operation</b> was estimated to be 2. 5, which is well above acceptable standard. Due to this reduction in rejection rate in one quality characteristics of one particular ring out of 800 types, the net savings to the organization is approximately Rs. 10, 44, 000 per year...|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The introduction of overhead camshaft valve train systems some 25 years ago has resulted in improved engine performance and efficiency, this in turn however, has caused increased wear problems. In {{order to understand the}} tribological behaviour of overhead camshaft systems, test engines and dynameter test methods have been extensively used. These are however, time consuming and expensive, a cheaper and quicker method of camshaft material and lubricant appraisal is therefore required and this has resulted in the design and construction of a simulative overhead camshaft test rig. A range of commercially available camshaft and follower materials have been tested using both a fully formulated and a -mineral base -equivalent. The most commonly encountered cam and follower wear failures of scuffing, pitting and polishing were reproduced. Results showed scuffing wear to be associated with all of the camshaft materials using the mineral base oil under high load, boundary lubrication conditions. Scuffing also occurred under low load, mixed lubrication conditions using the case-hardened steel cam and chilled white iron follower combinations. The remaining cam materials, carbonitrided and induction hardened grey flake iron did not fail under similar test conditions due to the presence of free graphite in the icrostructure. The fully formulated oil generally suppressed the onset of scuffing under all test conditions due to the presence of the zinc-dialkyldithiophosphate (Z. D. D. P) anti-wear additive in the oil. Pitting failure was associated with the chilled white iron follower using the fully formulated oil under high load conditions. This failure could have been initiated by either a surface, sub-surface or stress - corrosion mechanism. Analysis of this type of failure is complicated by the difference in both chill depth and hardness and also the presence. of cracks within, samples prior to examination and testing. Standardisation of chilled white irons therefore needs to be carried out in order to understand fully the wear behaviour of such materials. Polishing wear was associated with the fully formulated oil at low loads, and appeared to occur by a chemical reaction between the contacting surfaces and the additives present in the oil. The use of the acetate replica technique proved a satisfactory method of analysing the change in surface topography of cam surfaces. Using the fully formulated oil the cam surface 'ran in' satisfactorily, by a process of plastic deformation and fracture, whilst the mineral base oil caused instanteous scuffing of the cam surface. Once the surfaces had 'run in' satisfactorily by using either the additives in the oil or by a diamond <b>lapping</b> <b>operation,</b> the cams continued to run without scuffing in the mineral base oil under continuous, non stop test conditions. An intermittent, stop/start operating cycle however results in eventual scuffing due to additive film depletion and repeated surface interaction under boundary lubrication conditions. From a range of 'new' materials tested for follower application the ceramics, {{with the exception of the}} toughened zirconia, exhibited the best wear characteristics using a case hardened steel cam as a standard and tested under mineral base oil conditions. The silicon carbide and sialon ceramics both exhibited a low frictional resistance and wear rate, whilst the metallic follower materials of cobalt and nickel base hard facing alloys and a ceramic fibre reinforced aluminium/silicon alloy all suffered some form of material.

Recently, the equivalence of 3 -resonance and maximal resonance {{has been shown to be}} valid also for coronoid systems, carbon nanotubes, polyhexes in tori and Klein bottles, and fullerene graphs. So our main problem is to investigate the extent of graphs possessing this interesting property. In this paper, by replacing the above hexagons with even faces, we define k-resonance of graphs in surfaces, possibly with boundary, in a unified way. Some exceptions exist. For plane polygonal systems tessellated with polygons of even size at least six such that all inner vertices have the same degree three and the others have degree two or three, we show that such 3 -resonant polygonal systems are indeed maximally resonant.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most studies {{available}} on laparoscopic colorectal surgery focus on highly selected patient groups. The {{aim of the}} present study was to review short- and long-term outcome of everyday patients treated in a general surgery department. METHODS: Retrospective review was carried out of a prospective database of all consecutive patients having undergone primary laparoscopic (LAP) or open colorectal surgery between March 1993 and December 1997. Follow-up data were completed via questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 187 patients underwent LAP resection and 215 patients underwent open surgery. Follow up was complete in 95 % with a median of 59 months (range, 1 - 107 months) and 53 months (range, 1 - 104 months), respectively. There were 28 conversions (15 %) in the LAP group and these remained in the LAP group in an intention-to-treat analysis. The <b>LAP</b> <b>operations</b> lasted significantly longer for all types of resections (205 vs 150 min, P < 0. 001) and hospital stay was shorter (8 vs 13 days, P < 0. 001). Recovery of intestinal function was faster in the LAP group, but only after left-sided procedures (3 vs 4 days, P < 0. 01). However, preoperative patient selection (more emergency operations and patients with higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score in the open group) had a major influence on these elements and favours the LAP group. Surprisingly, the overall surgical complication rate (including long-term complications such as wound hernia) was 20 % in both groups with rates of individual complications also being comparable in both groups. CONCLUSION: Despite a patient selection favourable to the laparoscopy group, only little advantage in postoperative outcome could be shown for the minimally invasive over the open approach in the everyday patient...|$|R
40|$|ESA’s Rosetta {{mission is}} {{currently}} {{en route to}} comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, where it will arrive in 2014. Among the instruments onboard, the Langmuir probe instrument LAP of the Rosetta Plasma Consortium {{can be expected to}} be particularly sensitive to early activation of the comet, as it can detect small plasma density changes even at the very low densities typical of the solar wind plasma. By running various operational modes, LAP can also characterize the denser plasmas expected to appear as the coma develops, and monitor the plasma dynamics around the comet all through the mission. In order to exploit these possibilities from the start of operations at the comet, it is essential to define useful operational modes in advance. The objective of this project was to prepare for <b>LAP</b> <b>operations</b> at the comet by simulating LAP measurements in the plasma environment expected at the comet, and for what can be regarded as typical operational scenarios for the spacecraft itself. To do so, results of an ESA-sponsored modeling activity at the International Space Science Institute formed the background, combined with a simulation of the LAP measurements. The results show that for heliocentric distances less than 2 AU, the LAP probe currents are appropriate to follow the dynamics of the plasma, but to extract the electron density and temperature dependence so to give an absolute value of the former we need other instruments, e. g. MIP designed to measure the electron density and temperature, in particular inside the contact surface of the comet, if the electron temperature indeed is as low as predicted by the models. The results also show that Rosetta has a good chance of occasionally being located close to the contact surface which creates a very good possibility to investigate the physics of this hitherto almost unexplored boundary...|$|R

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Clinical recovery after laparoscopic cholecystectomy {{is known to be}} more rapid than after conventional open cholecystectomy. However, the actual effect of a laparoscopic approach on gastrointestinal motility, particularly fed-state motility, is not well investigated. METHODS: Laparoscopic (LAP, n= 6) or open (OPEN, n= 6) cholecystectomy was performed in 12 dogs. Bipolar recording electrodes were placed on the antrum, small intestine, and the transverse and descending colon, and fasting myoelectric data were recorded after operation. Solid meal gastric emptying studies were performed before surgery and on postoperative days 1 and 2. Transit time studies were performed using 10 radiopaque markers. RESULTS: Gastric emptying was significantly delayed in the OPEN group at 120 minutes on postoperative day 1 compared with pre-operative emptying (p< 0. 05), but was not delayed on postoperative day 2. Gastric emptying was not delayed in the <b>LAP</b> group after <b>operation.</b> Transit time was the same between groups. Gastric dysrhythmias were more frequent on postoperative day 3 (p< 0. 05) in the OPEN group. There {{were no significant differences in}} the presence, cycle length, or propagation velocity of the migrating motor complex on any postoperative day. Discrete or continuous electrical response activity in the colon was observed by postoperative day 1 in both groups.

40|$|EP 1050512 A UPAB: 20010110 NOVELTY - Before {{separation}} of the sludge, amphiphilic agents are added. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preferred features: The addition converts the sludge into a state in which it settles under gravity into a compact sediment with clear supernatant liquor. Settlement under gravity continues for 1 hour, or preferably only 15 minutes. Following sedimentation, the liquid is separated by centrifugation. The sediment is then pressed to remove more liquid, which is intercepted. The solid phase is briquetted. The liquid phase is filtered, adding the solids arising, to the previously-separated solid phase. Amphiphilic agent is separated from the liquid and the solid phases by distillation and drying, respectively. It is then recycled, and/or purified by distillation. USE - A method especially suitable for fractionation of sludges, particularly inorganic sludges arising in <b>lapping</b> and honing <b>operations.</b> ADVANTAGE - Complete, immediate {{separation of}} such sludges is not possible. The new process avoids disposal and incineration, offering a method recovering both fluid and solid. Abrasives recovered include e. g. silicon carbide, boron nitride, corundum and/or diamond particles. These comparatively valuable substances can be re-used. Addition of low viscosity lipophiles is ineffective; only by use of short chain amphiphiles is the dispersion significantly de-stabilized, resulting in compact sedimentation under gravity, leaving clear, oil-containing supernatant liquid above. Conventional processes complete preparation of the separated fractions. The method is particularly suitable for sludges containing stable dispersions of oil and emulsifiers, as with lapping and honing abrasives. The viscosity is comparatively high, making conventional separations ineffective. Examples, and comparative tables of results are included in this disclosure...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} work was primarily concentrated on precise ductile-mode grinding (milling) of flat surfaces of silicon, mainly Integrated Circuit (IC) silicon chips (dies), which were about 700 Âµm thick {{and the top}} of their surfaces covered with a silicon nitride layer. Substantial amount of partial-ductile streaks on a machined silicon surface shortens polishing time dramatically. This is of vital importance particularly in chip-making and optical industries for failure analysis. Failure analysis is a technique usually practised for locating a fault in a finished IC product. In chip-making industries, the analysis is done on the damage-free mirror-like finished silicon die of the IC. Grinding, <b>lapping</b> and/or polishing <b>operations</b> are required to get such a smooth surface. Precision grinding in a ductile mode therefore remains the critical and most important machining operation as the surface and sub-surface damages will be minimized. This results in good quality surface in terms of surface finish and flatness {{and at the same time}} generating the maximum amount of ductile streaks on the machined surface. Silicon material other than the IC silicon was also tried out for purpose of comparison and because of limited number of IC chips. Silicon like any hard and brittle material is well known for its low machinability unless it is machined under ductile mode condition. Ductile mode machining is a process that makes brittle materials to behave like ductile materials. A low cost machining technique, which facilitates partial-ductile mode grinding of small areas on thin wafer-like silicon, was developed. A specially modified conventional MAHO CNC Vertical Milling Centre that has an air driven low powered high-speed attachment (precision jig grinder) facilitated the diamond grinding. Special fixtures were designed and fabricated that held the workpieces in position and prevented them from damage during machining. Both traditional and statistical techniques for designing of experiments and subsequent analysis of results were employed in this study. A low cutting force dynamometer (Compacdyn) was used to measure cutting forces. Form Talysurf and Surfcom Surface Analysers and Atomic Force Microscope were used to measure surface texture parameters. Optical, Scanning Electron microscopy techniques, together with the Surfcom Surface Analyser and Atomic Force Microscope, were used to examine the surface morphology of the machined silicon surfaces. It was found that the amount of ductile streaks generated on a work-piece surface was not only dependent on feed and depth of cut but also on the grit size of diamond abrasive. The machining technique of grinding yielded ground surfaces with Ra as low as 50 nm, and forces around 0. 8 Newton. Flatness of the machined surfaces is very good. A model of surface roughness (Ra) for precision grinding of thin silicon has been established...|$|R
