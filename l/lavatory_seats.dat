50|$|The Sanitary {{garden is}} an art {{exhibition}} consisting of artworks made from bathroom and toilet items such as <b>lavatory</b> <b>seats</b> and ballcocks.|$|E
50|$|QWERTY Tummy {{was first}} coined by British {{consumers}} group Which? {{in the context}} of its study on office hygiene. A survey and chemical analysis of 33 keyboards by scientific experts found among other susbstances, food poisoning bugs such as e-coli and staphylococcus, comparing the results to those found on <b>lavatory</b> <b>seats</b> and door handles. The findings, according to the experts were supposedly identical to offices all over Britain with some keyboards harboring 150 times the acceptable limit that a human can endure and five times more bacteria than <b>lavatory</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Peter Dennison, {{owner of}} French {{furniture}} firm Moth, {{offered for sale}} {{one of the original}} <b>lavatory</b> <b>seats</b> from Tittenhurst Park. It was displayed in the window of the Brighton Musical Exchange shop in Trafalgar Street, Brighton. Mr. Dennison had bought the seat when his architectural salvage firm was offered furniture by the contractors doing the renovations at Tittenhurst Park. The asking price was £285.|$|E
30|$|This study deliberates two {{mechanically}} actuated trial system {{approaches for}} optimizing the flushing system design applicable for ground base <b>lavatory</b> and <b>seat</b> <b>lavatory</b> systems.|$|R
50|$|Even when {{no visible}} dirt is present, {{contamination}} by microorganisms, especially pathogens, can still cause an object or location {{to be considered}} dirty. For example, computer keyboards are especially dirty as, on average, they contain 70 times more microbes than a <b>lavatory</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|R
30|$|This study deliberates two trial {{approaches}} for optimizing the flushing system design. Both are mechanically actuated by an external pedal mechanism. The pedal mechanism triggers, in synchronization, the water flushing valve system. It is applicable for ground base <b>lavatory</b> and <b>seat</b> <b>lavatory</b> systems.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the prices}} of some {{platinum}} group metals can be much higher, gold has long been considered the most desirable of precious metals, and its value {{has been used as}} the standard for many currencies. Gold {{has been used as a}} symbol for purity, value, royalty, and particularly roles that combine these properties. Gold as a sign of wealth and prestige was ridiculed by Thomas More in his treatise Utopia. On that imaginary island, gold is so abundant that it is used to make chains for slaves, tableware, and <b>lavatory</b> <b>seats.</b> When ambassadors from other countries arrive, dressed in ostentatious gold jewels and badges, the Utopians mistake them for menial servants, paying homage instead to the most modestly dressed of their party.|$|E
50|$|The goods brake van is less attractive, is {{generally}} the last vehicle on the train, open on both sides, {{and does not}} necessarily have interior lighting/lamps, but it does house a small WC <b>lavatory</b> <b>seat</b> for the guards, owing to their long hours on freight trains. The van is less secure and has fewer features than the passenger brake van. Eight-wheeled brake vans were introduced recently to improve the riding comfort for the guards.|$|R
2500|$|Because {{of their}} {{aluminium}} and steel construction, they weighed only 26 tons tare (Suburban) and approx. 27¼ tons tare (Main Line). Unusually, these coaches had inward opening doors, {{similar to the}} American [...] "Pullman" [...] design, but this proved unpopular and somewhat confusing to the passengers and so were rebuilt conventionally. The suburban coach seated 82, while the main line coach, fitted with <b>lavatories,</b> <b>seated</b> 70 passengers. These coaches rode on Commonwealth bogies, the first in Ireland to be so fitted.|$|R
50|$|Each {{triptych}} shows {{views from}} moments before, {{during and after}} Dyer's death. The scenes are not represented linearly; they do not always read from left to right. Each shows a comatose man, collapsed or dead near the hotel room's <b>lavatory</b> <b>seat.</b> In most, Dyer is followed by black horizontal fleshy winged creatures, raw and red/pink blobs of dying flesh, or by painterly arrows. These devices act both as pointers to the depravity and tragedy of the scene and as manifestations of Bacon's guilt at {{the death of an}} emotionally dependent friend.|$|R
5000|$|Dee {{had several}} court {{appearances}} and in 1974 served 28 days in Pentonville Prison for non-payment of rates on his former Chelsea home. Every {{time he left}} his cell the prisoners on his wing shouted, [...] "It's Siiiiiimon Dee!" [...] He was so shocked by prison that he swore he would never get into debt again. On another occasion he was jailed for vandalising a <b>lavatory</b> <b>seat</b> with Petula Clark's face painted on it, which he thought was disrespectful to her. The magistrate who sentenced him was Bill Cotton.|$|R
50|$|Patrick Kinna was the Duke of Windsor's {{confidential}} clerk {{during the}} Duke's {{service to the}} British military mission to France, and was recommended by the Duke's staff to Churchill. He met most of the key Allied figures, from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Joseph Stalin. In addition to his Pitman shorthand speed of 150 words per minute, Kinna could take dictation straight on to a manual typewriter at 50 words per minute. In the rather cramped bathroom at Chartwell, Churchill would dictate to him from his bath, while Kinna typed in the only other place there was to sit, {{on top of the}} <b>lavatory</b> <b>seat,</b> with the typewriter on his knee. The typescript would be ready for the Prime Minister by the time his valet had towelled him dry.|$|R
50|$|In the 1880s, Prince Edward (later Edward VII) {{purchased}} {{his country}} seat of Sandringham House in Norfolk and asked Thomas Crapper & Co. {{to supply the}} plumbing, including thirty <b>lavatories</b> with cedarwood <b>seats</b> and enclosures, thus giving Crapper his first Royal Warrant. The firm received further warrants from Edward as king and from George V both as Prince of Wales and as king.|$|R
5000|$|In 1966, GM {{introduced}} the PD-4107. Also known informally as [...] "decks", these buses {{were similar in}} some ways to the Scenicruiser design, but had a larger [...] "second level" [...] with the first level reduced, and the lavatory was located at the rear. The 4107 was 35 ft in length, and nominally (without <b>lavatory)</b> would <b>seat</b> 41 passengers (38 or 39 with lavatory). In 1968, the PD-4903 was introduced, a 40 ft long version of the 4107 which nominally would seat 49 passengers (46 or 47 with lavatory). The PD-4903 was the first GM bus to use a 24 volt electrical system and was 40 feet long with a third luggage bay. For states with lower axle load limits, a factory option used the third bay to hold a retractable two-tire axle.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Aeroflot ordered 30 Sukhoi Superjet 100 {{aircraft}} with 98 {{seats in}} one class. Later, the airline decided {{to upgrade the}} avionics (FMS and weather radar) and modify the aircraft arrangement with 87 seats in two class, and extra cabin crew <b>seat,</b> <b>lavatory</b> and galley. To avoid delivery delays, the first 10 SSJ100 have the original “light” specification and the followers were updated (“full”). In {{the first half of}} 2014 Sukhoi began to replace in Aeroflot the “light” aircraft by “full” version. The last “full” version was delivered in June 2014, the “light” aircraft are operated by other Russian airlines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{intended}} {{transit time}} for each run was eighteen to nineteen hours with one night aboard. Sixty-one staterooms on the hurricane deck and main deck aft of machinery spaces were for first class white passengers and eleven staterooms on the shade deck were reserved for twenty-one first class colored passengers. Other accommodations were provided for seventy-eight steerage passengers and fifty-four [...] "second class" [...] passengers indicated as [...] "deck passengers" [...] and eighty-two crew. All staterooms and deck housing were white painted pine with salons and passenger spaces aft excepting staterooms paneled in mahogany. Staterooms had two berths, the upper folding away {{when not in}} use and hair stuffed transom <b>seats,</b> <b>lavatories,</b> toilet and ventilation.|$|R
