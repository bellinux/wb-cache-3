The two traveled to the Middle East in 1889 and purchased several purebred Arabian horses for use in their new breeding program. Stroganov also purchased horses from Crabbet Arabian Stud in England, including the mares Makbula and Sobha, and the stallion Mesaoud, who came from Crabbet Stud by way of Kleniewski Stud in modern-day Poland.|$|R

Sotamm was foaled in England and then sold to the Egyptian government by Lady Wentworth of the Crabbet Arabian Stud. In a near-similar manner, Sotamm's grandsire Mesaoud, imported from Egypt by the Blunts, also sold to Russia and stood at the Tersk Stud when it was privately owned by Count Sergei Aleksandrovich Stroganov and his brother-in-law Prince <b>Aleksandr</b> <b>Grigorievich</b> Shcherbatov.|$|R

In the 2011 Freedom House Freedom of the Press report, Belarus scored 92 {{on a scale}} from 10 (most free) to 99 (least free) because <b>Aleksandr</b> <b>Lukashenko's</b> regime curtails press freedom.

50|$|After {{the breakup}} of Soviet Union in 1991, Belarusization came into full effect, with Belarusian {{becoming}} the only state language, and children started receiving education in Belarusian.

40|$|The article {{seeks to}} answer to the question: what defined people’s choice when they voted for the first time, in 1994, <b>Aleksandr</b> <b>Lukashenko</b> into office. While agreeing {{that there is a}} {{significant}} amount of research on this topic, the author aims to illuminate what exactly helped the electorate to navigate and choose between the nearly identical promises of social justice and well-being, which were made by all six candidates for the presidency in 1994. Correspondingly, the article explores key-texts created {{in the first years of}} the country’s independence (between 1991 and 1994) by the Belarusian Popular Front and its leader Zianon Paz’niak and by (and on behalf of) Aleksand Lukashenko, to date the only Belarusian President. As a result, an explanation that relies on the decoding of the voices represented by the candidates’ texts is offered. These voices were part of an ideology brought out by a new political discourse...|$|R
50|$|On 15 December 2010, Sannikov logged two legal {{complaint}} {{applications to}} the Central Election Commission of Belarus, demanding they withdraw the registration of <b>Aleksandr</b> <b>Lukashenko,</b> and also remove Lidiya Yermoshyna, the Chairperson of the Central Election Commission, from office. In both cases, he cited that their positions were illegal. Yermoshyna {{was a member}} of Lukashenka's political team, compromising her neutrality, and was under international scrutiny for purportedly rigging the previous election. He also brought up that Lukashenko ignored his own guidelines on how much time presidential candidates were allowed to speak on television (2 times for 30 minutes each). Lukashenko also had propagandistic meetings at places not included on the Minsk City Executive Committee list where meetings could be held; Lukashenko held a large event at the Palace of the Republic, and funded it with the state budget against the rules. Sannikov's complaints were ineffective.|$|R
40|$|January 2011. The	  findings	  within	  it	  synthesize	  firsthand {{experiences}} and	  original	  research,	   seeking	  to	  add	  to	  the debate on	  current	  policy	  approaches	  to	  Belarus. 1 After {{almost twenty}} years in power, President <b>Aleksandr</b> <b>Lukashenko</b> has run out of time. His attempts to “buy time ” from Russia and the West have run out the clock on his regime, backing him into a corner from which he can’t emerge unscathed. Profligate spending, the loss of Russian subsidies and global macroeconomic events have brought Belarus’s economy to its knees. Lukashenko is {{forced to choose between}} Eastern and Western benefactors – chancing the unknown dangers of true democratic change or facing the obvious evils of extensive Russian ownership of strategic assets. Both options threaten the President’s slipping grip on Belarus and are likely to speed up his fall from grace. The current economic crisis represents the culmination of years of “buying time ” – living crisis to crisis and enacting reforms only under serious pressure from an economic benefactor. After twenty years, Lukashenko has exhausted both Russian and Western goodwill, and as Belarus stands on the brink of crisis, change is sure t...|$|R
5000|$|A joint {{statement}} from the Foreign Ministers of the Czech Republic (Karel Schwarzenberg), Germany (Guido Westerwelle), Poland (Radosław Sikorski) and Sweden (Carl Bildt) on December 23 declared that [...] "there can be no business-as-usual between the European Union and Belarus’ president, <b>Aleksandr</b> <b>Lukashenko,</b> after what has happened since the presidential election in Belarus. ... continued positive engagement with Mr. Lukashenko at the moment {{seems to be a}} waste of time and money. He has made his choice — and it is a choice against everything the European Union stands for." [...] They added that [...] "while the voting proceeded in an orderly fashion, the counting of the votes turned into a charade. The report of the independent observers assessed the counting as 'bad' or 'very bad' in nearly half the polling stations they could observe, and it is not unreasonable to assume that it was even worse in the others. It became obvious that there were orders not to count votes, but to deliver a predetermined result. The combination of vote-rigging and outright repression makes what Milosevic tried to do in Serbia in 2000 pale in comparison. What we have seen brings back memories of the introduction of martial law in Poland in 1981." ...|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{election}} of Belarus' first president (<b>Aleksandr</b> <b>Lukashenko)</b> in July 1994, Lukashenko has steadily consolidated his power through authoritarian means. Government restrictions on {{freedom of speech and}} the press, peaceful assembly, and religion remain in place. Belarus, according to the CIA a [...] "republic in name, although in fact a dictatorship", is viewed as a rogue state by the United States and European democracies—one whose conduct is out of line with international norms of behavior, and whose regime is considered to violate human rights. Some examples were the harassment of the Union of Poles in Belarus (which represents ethnic Poles in the region) and the abduction, unlawful detainment and torture of American attorney Emanuel Zeltser and his assistant (and journalist) Vladlena Funk during the US-Belarus hostage crisis of 2008-2009.Religious, political and journalistic activity is tightly controlled. Other alleged human rights violations include the digging-up of a Jewish cemetery to build a sports stadium. Concerns have also been raised by the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews (UCSJ), among others, of Lukashenko's alleged use of neo-Nazis to intimidate opposition supporters during general elections. There have also been accusations of spying on ordinary citizens and minority groups in what commentators have called a manner reminiscent of the Soviet Union.|$|R
