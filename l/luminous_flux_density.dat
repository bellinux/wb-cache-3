40|$|Two {{methods for}} the {{measurement}} of the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> are presented: the first {{is based on an}} integrating sphere and a <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> standard lamp, the second utilizes an accurate goniometer and an accurate illuminance meter. A comparison between the two methods is carried on for two different light sources: an LED and a halogen source, presenting different <b>luminous</b> <b>fluxes.</b> The measuring procedure and an evaluation of the measurement uncertainties are described for both the methods. The comparison shows a good agreement between the two measuring processes: both of them allow the identification of the <b>luminous</b> <b>fluxes</b> with relative uncertainties of about 1. 5 %, covering the differences between the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> values. The comparison is considered a valid possibility of verifying the calibration constancy of the laboratory <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> and illuminance standards...|$|R
50|$|The SI unit of <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> is the lumen (lm). One lumen {{is defined}} as the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> of light {{produced}} by a light source that emits one candela of luminous intensity over a solid angle of one steradian. In other systems of units, <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> may have units of power.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> (or visible power) in a {{light source}} {{is defined by the}} {{photopic}} luminosity function. The following equation calculates the total <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> in a source of light: ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> {{accounts}} for {{the sensitivity of the}} eye by weighting the power at each wavelength with the luminosity function, which represents the eye's response to different wavelengths. The <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> is a weighted sum of the power at all wavelengths in the visible band. Light outside the visible band does not contribute. The ratio of the total <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> to the radiant flux is called the luminous efficacy.|$|R
50|$|<b>Luminous</b> <b>flux</b> {{is often}} used as an {{objective}} measure of the useful light emitted by a light source, and is typically reported on the packaging for light bulbs, {{although it is not}} always prominent. Consumers commonly compare the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> of different light bulbs since it provides an estimate of the apparent amount of light the bulb will produce, and a lightbulb with a higher ratio of <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> to consumed power is more efficient.|$|R
50|$|In LED lighting, lumen {{maintenance}} is the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> remaining (expressed {{as a percentage}} of the initial output) at any selected elapsed operating time. Lumen depreciation is the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> lost over time, and thus the complement of {{lumen maintenance}}.|$|R
5000|$|The lumen (symbol: lm) is the SI {{derived unit}} of <b>luminous</b> <b>flux,</b> {{a measure of}} the total {{quantity}} of visible light emitted by a source. <b>Luminous</b> <b>flux</b> differs from power (radiant flux) in that radiant flux includes all electromagnetic waves emitted, while <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> is weighted according to a model (a [...] "luminosity function") of the human eye's sensitivity to various wavelengths. Lumens are related to lux in that one lux is one lumen per square meter.|$|R
40|$|Analysis of <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> {{transfer}} {{through a}} conical ring-core light guide is presented. Three optical guides {{of this kind}} are the main elements of an original instrument for measurement of the luminance distribution {{in the field of}} view constructed by the authors. It was found {{that in the case of}} the output surface perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the cone having vertical angles greater than 50 ° the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> is not transmitted through this kind of light guide. The conical output surface with great vertical angle considerably improves the process of transfering the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> through a conical ring-core light guide. Replacing a flat outlet surface of the light guide by a conical one makes the transferred <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> more uniform to some extent...|$|R
50|$|If a {{light source}} emits one candela of {{luminous}} intensity uniformly across a solid angle of one steradian, the total <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> emitted into that angle is one lumen (1 cd·1 sr = 1 lm).Alternatively, an isotropic one-candela light-source emits a total <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> of exactly 4π lumens. If the source were partly covered by an ideal absorbing hemisphere, that system would radiate {{half as much}} <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> - only 2π lumens. The luminous intensity would still be one candela in those directions that are not obscured.|$|R
5000|$|Illuminance is {{a measure}} of how much <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> is spread over a given area. One can think of <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> (measured in lumens) as a measure of the total [...] "amount" [...] of visible light present, and the {{illuminance}} as a measure of the intensity of illumination on a surface. A given amount of light will illuminate a surface more dimly if it is spread over a larger area, so illuminance is inversely proportional to area when the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> is held constant.|$|R
40|$|A simple {{iterative}} optimization {{method is}} developed {{to improve the}} exiting light uniformity of the edge-lit backlight module. The method uses the relative deviation of the average <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> of the entire light guide plate (LGP) and the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> of each region as constraint criterion and {{the ratio of the}} <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> of each region to the average <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> of the LGP as adjustment coefficient to adjust the density of the microstructures in each region. This process loops until the relative deviations of all regions meet a prespecified threshold value. A LGP based on microprism structure is presented to validate the method. The initial values, which represent the size of the microstructures manufactured on the bottom surfaces of the LGP, d 0 -dependent <b>luminous</b> <b>fluxes,</b> microstructure size distributions, iterations of the LGP, and the relative deviation of each region are discussed. The simulation results show that it is a very practical method for the uniformity improvement of the backlight when an appropriate initial value is selected and the final uniformity is better than 90 % after optimization...|$|R
40|$|Summary A {{precision}} goniophotometer {{developed at}} the Istituto Elettrotecnico Nazionale, Turin, {{has been used to}} measure the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> of standard lamps, with a view to realising a total <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> scale by relating the lumen to the candela through its fundamental definition.

40|$|The Absolute Integrating-Sphere Method was {{developed}} and introduced by NIST for {{the realization of the}} <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> unit using an integrating sphere rather than a goniophotometer. The total <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> of a lamp inside the sphere is calibrated against the known amount of flux introduced into the sphere from the external source through a calibrated aperture. The key element of this method is the correction for the spatial nonuniformity of the integrating sphere, which has been made possible by a technique using a scanning-beam source. This method is to be applied directly to routine calibration measurements of <b>luminous</b> <b>flux.</b> A new <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> calibration facility with a 2. 5 m integrating sphere has been recently completed at NIST and will allow the calibration of test lamps with no need for <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> standard lamps. Calibrations will be performed based on the illuminance measurement of the external source by standard photometers. This method makes the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> calibration a detector-based procedure, thereby eliminating the uncertainties {{associated with the use of}} standard lamps while achieving lower uncertainties by shortening the calibration chain. The characteristics of the new integrating sphere obtained by computer simulation and measurements are reported.

The NIST 2 m integrating sphere was modified {{to add an}} opening and an additional baffle to apply this method. Flux from an external source (1000 W quartz halogen lamp) is introduced into the sphere through a limiting aperture and the opening. The flux entering the sphere is determined from the measured area of the aperture and the illuminance on the aperture plane measured with the NIST standard photometers that maintain the NIST illuminance scale. The total <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> {{of a group of}} standard lamps measured inside the sphere is deduced by comparison to the flux from the external source. Corrections are made for the spatial non-uniformity and the incident angle dependence of the sphere response, and the spectral mismatch of the integrating sphere photometer responsivity. The total <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> measured with the integrating sphere system is compared to the values obtained with a goniophotometer of PTB, Germany.

40|$|Effects of {{hysteresis}} and inertial processes on the instantaneous <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> of {{fluorescent lamps}} (FLs) are experimentally investigated, which are fed by frequency controlled, dimmable, electronic ballasts. Other phenomena are also examined, {{such as the}} time displacement between the light ripple and the waveform of the electrical power of the lamp, the 'modulation' of the instantaneous <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> waveform and generally, the behaviour of the lamp at varying high frequency (HF) levels. For a typical FL, fed by dimmable electronic ballast with frequency control, inertial processes are reduced, as the operating frequency of the lamp decreases.

40|$|The <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> (unit, lumen) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} characteristics of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) along with the luminous intensity, and is commonly measured using integrating sphere photometers. However, large variations of measurement results are reported among different manufacturers and users of LEDs, which is causing difficulties in trade. CIE 127 [1] gave a good solution to the problems in luminous intensity measurements, but does not give sufficient treatment for the problems in <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> measurement. There are issues such as the LED mounting geometry (4, 2), treatment of backward emission, the best integrating sphere geometries, etc., which are being addressed in CIE Technical Committee 2 - 45. While these issues are to be resolved, there is an urgent need for standard LEDs in order to certify measurement accuracy in industrial laboratories. To address such needs, NIST has developed measurement procedures to calibrate total <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> of LEDs using the existing NIST 2. 5 m integrating sphere [2].
