5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people with a history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E

5|$|Bupropion <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E

5|$|Early 20th-century weight limits were enacted {{to protect}} dirt and gravel roads from {{damage caused by}} the solid wheels of heavy trucks.

By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits. The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy trucks, and to protect roads and bridges from {{the damage caused by}} the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> legal weight limit for shorter trucks, preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Some {{birds have}} also {{demonstrated}} {{the capacity to}} fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time. The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative {{to the outside of}} the flock. This may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock. This adaptation is also known from marine mammals. Communal roosting is common because it <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators. Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety.|$|E

5|$|While natural {{selection}} has a direction, guiding evolution towards heritable adaptations {{to the current}} environment, genetic drift has no direction and is guided only by the mathematics of chance.

5|$|As {{a natural}} side-effect {{of the size}} of the fuel {{elements}} and their resulting explosions, ICF designs use a very large reaction chamber many meters across. This <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> neutron flux on any particular part of the chamber wall through the inverse square law. Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near or inside the reactor, and the laser is isolated on the far side of long optical paths. The far side of the chamber is empty, allowing the blanket to be placed there and easily maintained. Although the reaction chamber walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, the chamber is essentially a large steel ball of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced without too much effort. The reaction chamber is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in magnetic fusion concepts, and the LIFE designs proposed building several and quickly moving them in and out of production.|$|E
5|$|Distinguishing {{features}} of the teleosts are mobile premaxilla, elongated neural arches {{at the end of}} the caudal fin and unpaired basibranchial toothplates. The premaxilla is unattached to the neurocranium (braincase); it plays a role in protruding the mouth and creating a circular opening. This <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> pressure inside the mouth, sucking the prey inside. The lower jaw and maxilla are then pulled back to close the mouth, and the fish is able to grasp the prey. By contrast, mere closure of the jaws would risk pushing food out of the mouth. In more advanced teleosts, the premaxilla is enlarged and has teeth, while the maxilla is toothless. The maxilla functions to push both the premaxilla and the lower jaw forward. To open the mouth, an adductor muscle pulls back the top of the maxilla, pushing the lower jaw forward. In addition, the maxilla rotates slightly, which pushes forward a bony process that interlocks with the premaxilla.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E

5|$|Maraba {{coffee is}} {{grown in the}} south of Rwanda at {{coordinates}} , roughly 12kilometres (7mi) from Butare and 150kilometres (93mi) from the capital, Kigali. The project began in the Maraba District of Butare Province, but these entities were replaced under local government organisation in 2006, and the area is now part of Huye District in the Southern Province. The area is very hilly, due to its proximity to the Western Rift Valley and the montane Nyungwe Forest, and features rich volcanic soils. The coffee is grown at altitudes between 1,700 and 2,100 metres (5,577â6,889ft) above sea level, often on steep hillsides with terrace farming. The area experiences an average of 115centimetres (45in) of rainfall annually. The majority of this falls during the rainy season of March to May, the major coffee harvesting season. The high altitude <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> temperature slightly to an average of about 20 Â°C (68 Â°F). There is little seasonal variation.|$|E
5|$|Optic nerve sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the optic nerve in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, {{but it may be}} the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1â2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other uses}} have been {{researched}} for bupropion. There has been controversy {{about whether it}} is useful to add an antidepressant such as bupropion to a mood stabilizer in people with bipolar depression, but recent reviews have concluded that bupropion in this situation does no significant harm and may sometimes give significant benefit. Bupropion has shown no effectiveness in the treatment of cocaine dependence, but there is weak evidence that it may be useful in treating methamphetamine dependence. Based on studies indicating that bupropion <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> level of the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropionâlike other antidepressants, with the exception of duloxetine (Cymbalta)âis not effective in treating chronic low back pain. It does, however, show some promise in the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E
