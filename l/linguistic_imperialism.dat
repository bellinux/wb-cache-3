40|$|This {{research}} study examined perceptions of contemporary effects of colonialism among education professionals in Ghana, {{and the extent}} to which education professionals express awareness of colonialism in Ghanaian school systems and contemporary Ghanaian society. An overview of literature in Critical Race Theory, Social Justice Education Theory, Oppression Theory and Post-Colonial Theory provided the theoretical foundation that was used to guide this study. Five factors emerged from this literature review as a framework for analysis of study data. These five factors included discourse, cultural <b>imperialism,</b> <b>linguistic</b> hegemony, racism and internalized racism, and oppression. The study participants included education policy makers, administrators, counselors, teachers, and teacher educators in the educational system of Ghana. A set of thirty-two individual interviews and six focus groups comprised of twenty-seven participants were conducted in which educators described their perspectives of Ghanaian society and Ghanaian educational systems in their own words in response to a predetermined set of twelve questions. A document analysis established a baseline of data regarding the curriculum of Ghanaian schools as presented in curriculum guides, textbooks, and policy statements, handbooks and reports that describe the educational systems in Ghana today. Ghanaian educators expressed the most awareness of colonial legacies related to cultural <b>imperialism,</b> <b>linguistic</b> hegemony, internalized oppression and discourse. The findings suggest that educational professionals in Ghana demonstrate limited awareness of colonial legacies of racism and internalized racism, sexism, classism, ethnoreligious oppression and neocolonialism. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an account of}} Sino-Zambian relations at the local level, through an ethnographic analysis of Chinese language education in Zambia. It argues that Chinese language is {{a manifestation of the}} commodification of language (Heller 2010 a). Recently, two Chinese schools have opened their doors, and have since then been integrating into the Zambian educational system. Chinese language has been valued as a helpful tool in getting a job on the local and global market, or as a way out of Zambia by receiving a scholarship for a Chinese university. Chinese has become popular through China’s linguistic ideology that presents itself to Zambians as a useful economic tool for development. This thesis will show the relation between students’ cultural capital and self reflexivity, and Chinese <b>linguistic</b> ideology and <b>imperialism.</b> It describes how students of Chinese language try to catch the moving train towards progress and prosperity that China has to offer...|$|R
2500|$|Prescription, on {{the other}} hand, {{is an attempt to}} promote {{particular}} linguistic usages over others, often favouring a particular dialect or [...] "acrolect". This may have the aim of establishing a linguistic standard, which can aid communication over large geographical areas. It may also, however, be an attempt by speakers of one language or dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects (see <b>Linguistic</b> <b>imperialism).</b> An extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among censors, who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society. Prescription, however, may be practised appropriately in the teaching of language, like in ELT, where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical terms need to be introduced to a second-language speaker who is attempting to acquire the language.|$|E
2500|$|The autobiographical impulse of Decolonising the Mind {{allows for}} Ngũgĩ to elegantly intertwine {{personal}} and national politics. The anecdotal perspective in Decolonising the Mind lends a certain accessibility to readers on political or theoretical issues that {{is missing from}} much of the typical and more disengaged academic discussions of <b>linguistic</b> <b>imperialism</b> and post-colonialism. For example, in [...] "The Language of African Literature," [...] he details the trajectory of the 1884 Berlin Conference's evolution into the 1962 Makerere University College Conference on the Writers of English Expression {{as a way of}} illustrating how imperialism was able to indoctrinate even those who were conscious of and active in African literature. He had come to accept the Makerere conference as genuinely African, but he recounts how years later he was struck by his and others' blithe omission of many famous African language writers. He determines that in the 1962 Makerere conference, after [...] "all the years of selective education and rigorous tutelage," [...] he and his contemporaries had been led to accept the [...] "fatalistic logic of the unassailable position of English in our literature" [...] (20). [...] "The logic was embedded deep in imperialism," [...] he says. [...] "And it was imperialism and its effects that we did not examine at Markere. It is the final triumph of a system of domination when the dominated start singing its virtues" [...] (20).|$|E
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, <b>linguistic</b> <b>imperialism</b> has {{attracted}} attention among scholars of applied linguistics. In particular, Robert Phillipson's 1992 book, <b>Linguistic</b> <b>Imperialism,</b> {{has led to}} considerable debate about its merits and shortcomings. Phillipson found denunciations of <b>linguistic</b> <b>imperialism</b> that dated back to Nazi critiques of the British Council, and to Soviet analyses of English as the language of world capitalism and world domination. In this vein, criticism of English as a world language is rooted in anti-globalism.|$|E

50|$|The English {{language}} {{during the}} Middle Ages was {{an object of}} <b>linguistic</b> <b>imperialism</b> by the French language, particularly following the Norman conquest. For hundreds of years, French or Anglo-Norman was the language of administration (See Law French) and therefore a language of superior status in England. Latin remained {{the language of the}} church and of learning. Although many words introduced by the Normans are today indistinguishable by most English-speakers from native Germanic words, later-learned loanwords derived from Latin or French often have a more cultured sound to a native English-speaker.|$|E
50|$|Some European {{politicians}} and intellectuals have criticized Google's effort on <b>linguistic</b> <b>imperialism</b> grounds.

German, Russian, French, and Spanish, for instance, are popular languages in scholarship. The disproportionate online emphasis on English, however, could shape access to historical scholarship, and, ultimately, the growth and direction of future scholarship.

5000|$|Just as all {{the living}} world {{languages}} owe their status to <b>linguistic</b> <b>imperialism,</b> {{the suggestion of a}} given language as a world language or [...] "universal language" [...] has strong political implications. Thus, Russian was declared the [...] "world language of internationalism" [...] in Soviet literature, which at the same time denounced French as the [...] "language of fancy courtiers" [...] and English as the [...] "jargon of traders". A number of international auxiliary languages have been introduced as prospective world languages, the most successful of them being Esperanto, but none were learned by as many people as the world languages were. Many natural languages have been proffered as candidates for a global lingua franca.|$|E
50|$|After the {{overthrow}} of the imperial government by the left-wing Derg (Coordinating Council of the Armed Forces) in the 1974 coup d'état and the installation of a socialist military government, the Language Academy was seen as a chauvinistic vehicle of <b>linguistic</b> <b>imperialism,</b> and one that favoured of the tongue of the ruling elite {{at the expense of the}} country's eight dozen other languages and dialects. As a result, in 1979 it was transformed into the Academy of Ethiopian Languages under the Ministry of Culture and Sport, whose regulatory remit extended to all Ethiopian languages. It had four academic subcommittees: lexicography, linguistics, terminology, and literature- both written and oral (the inclusion of the latter signifying a significant break with the prior emphasis on Ge'ez and its literary tradition).|$|E
5000|$|Language {{diversity}} {{is part of}} ecolinguistics because {{of the relationship between}} diversity of local languages and biodiversity. This relationship arises because of the ecological wisdom (or cultural adaptation to the environment) that is encoded in local languages. The forces of globalisation and <b>linguistic</b> <b>imperialism</b> are allowing dominant language to spread, and replace these local languages (Nettle and Romaine 2000). This leads to a loss of both sustainable local cultures and the important ecological knowledge contained within their languages. One of the goals of ecolinguistic research is to protect both cultural diversity and the linguistic diversity that supports it (Terralingua 2016, Nettle and Romaine 2000, Harmond 1996, Mühlhaüsler 1995).

5000|$|Spanish and to {{a lesser}} extent Portuguese colonization, made these {{languages}} prevalent in South America and in parts of Africa, Asia (the Philippines), Macau and in former times in Formosa.

Russian <b>linguistic</b> <b>imperialism</b> can be detected in Belarus both in the former dispute over the name of the country (Belarus vs Belorussia) and in the common spelling of the name of their president.
