5|$|Many {{cases of}} {{hypothyroidism}} {{are associated with}} mild elevations in creatine kinase and liver enzymes in the blood.

Levels of cholesterol, <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoprotein</b> and lipoprotein (a) can be elevated; the impact of subclinical hypothyroidism on lipid parameters is less well-defined.|$|E
5|$|When a serpin {{inhibits}} {{a target}} protease, {{it forms a}} permanent complex, which needs to be disposed of. For extracellular serpins, the final serpin-enzyme complexes are rapidly cleared from circulation. One mechanism by which this occurs in mammals is via the <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoprotein</b> receptor-related protein (LRP), which binds to inhibitory complexes made by antithrombin, PA1-1, and neuroserpin, causing cellular uptake. Similarly, the Drosophila serpin, necrotic, is degraded in the lysosome after being trafficked into the cell by the Lipophorin Receptor-1 (homologous to the mammalian LDL receptor family).|$|E
50|$|At this point, the fats {{are in the}} {{bloodstream}} {{in the form of}} chylomicrons. Once in the blood, chylomicrons are subject to delipidation by lipoprotein lipase. Eventually, enough lipid has been lost and additional apolipoproteins gained, that the resulting particle (now referred to as a chylomicron remnant) can be taken up by the liver. From the liver, the fat released from chylomicron remnants can be re-exported to the blood as the triglyceride component of very <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoproteins.</b> Very <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoproteins,</b> also subject to delipidation by vascular lipoprotein lipase, delivers fats to tissues throughout the body and, in particular, the released fatty acids can be stored in adipose cells as triglycerides. As triglycerides are lost from very <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoproteins,</b> the lipoprotein particle becomes smaller and denser (since protein is denser than lipid) and ultimately becomes <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoproteins.</b> A great deal has been written about <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoproteins</b> because they are thought to be atherogenic.|$|R

In the present review we summarize and discuss the recent literature on the pathogenic role of <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoproteins</b> modified by oxidative processes in atherosclerosis and the possible role in renal diseases. Pathogenetically, the oxidation of <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoproteins</b> {{is considered to be}} a key event in the development of atherosclerosis, in part by causing enhanced uptake of lipids by macrophages.

5|$|Cholesterol {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoprotein</b> (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350–550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650–1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E
5|$|APOA5 mainly {{functions}} to influence plasma triglyceride levels. The first suggested mechanism supposes that APOA5 functions as an activator of lipoprotein lipase (which {{is a key}} enzyme in triglyceride catabolism) and, through this process, enhances the metabolism of TG-rich particles. The second is the possible effect of APOA5 on the secretion of VLDL particles, since APOA5 reduces hepatic production by inhibiting VLDL-particle production and assembly by binding to cellular membranes and lipids. Finally, the third possibility relates to the acceleration of the hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants {{and it has been}} shown that APOA5 binds to different members of the <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoprotein</b> receptor family. In addition to its TG-lowering effect, APOA5 also plays a significant role in modulating HDL maturation and cholesterol metabolism. Increased APOA5 levels were associated with skewed cholesterol distribution from VLDL to large HDL particles. APOA5 mRNA is upregulated during liver regeneration and this suggests that APOA5 serves a function in hepatocyte proliferation. It’s also reported that APOA5 could enhance insulin secretion in beta-cells and the cell surface midkine could be involved in APOA5 endocytosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Low-density</b> <b>{{lipoprotein}}</b> (LDL) {{are one of}} {{the five}} major groups of lipoprotein which transport all fat molecules around the body in the extracellular water. These groups, from least dense, compared to surrounding water, (largest particles) to most dense (smallest particles), are chylomicrons (aka ULDL by the overall density naming convention), very <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoprotein</b> (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoprotein</b> and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). LDL delivers fat molecules to the cells and can drive the progression of atherosclerosis if they become oxidized within the walls of arteries.|$|E

40|$|Paradoxically, {{meta-analysis}} of human randomized controlled trials revealed that natural but not synthetic α-tocopherol supplementation significantly increases all-cause mortality at 95 % confidence interval. The root cause was that natural α-tocopherol supplementation significantly depressed bioavailability of {{other forms of}} vitamin E that have better chemo-prevention capability. Meta-analysis outcome demonstrated flaws {{in the understanding of}} vitamin E. Reinterpretation of reported data provides plausible explanations to several important observations. While α-tocopherol is almost exclusively secreted in chylomicrons, enterocytes secrete tocotrienols in both chylomicrons and small high-density lipoproteins. Vitamin E secreted in chylomicrons is discriminately repacked by α-tocopherol transfer protein into nascent very <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoproteins</b> in the liver. Circulating very <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoproteins</b> undergo delipidation to form intermediate-density <b>lipoproteins</b> and <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoproteins.</b> Uptake of vitamin E in intermediate-density <b>lipoproteins</b> and <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoproteins</b> takes place at various tissues via <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoproteins</b> receptor–mediated endocytosis. Small high-density lipoproteins can deliver tocotrienols upon maturation to peripheral tissues independent of α-tocopherol transfer protein action, and uptake of vitamin E takes place at selective tissues by scavenger receptor–mediated direct vitamin E uptake. Dual absorption pathways for tocotrienols are consistent with human and animal studies. α-Tocopherol depresses the bioavailability of α-tocotrienol and has antagonistic effect on tocotrienols in chemo-prevention against degenerative diseases. Therefore, it is an undesirable component for chemo-prevention. Future research directions should be focused on tocotrienols, preferably free from α-tocopherol, for optimum chemo-prevention and benefits to mankind...|$|R

25|$|The {{atherosclerotic}} {{process is}} not fully understood.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} {{from the results of}} multiple human pharmacologic LDL lowering trials that LDL should be lowered to below 30 to reduce cardiovascular event rates to near zero. For reference, from longitudinal population studies following progression of atherosclerosis-related behaviors from early childhood into adulthood, it has been discovered that the usual LDL in childhood, before the development of fatty streaks, is about 35nbsp&mg/dL.

25|$|As {{with other}} statins, {{atorvastatin}} is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Unlike most others, however, it {{is a completely}} synthetic compound. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the reduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, which is the rate-limiting step in hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. Inhibition of the enzyme decreases de novo cholesterol synthesis, increasing expression of <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoprotein</b> receptors (LDL receptors) on hepatocytes. This increases LDL uptake by the hepatocytes, decreasing the amount of LDL-cholesterol in the blood. Like other statins, atorvastatin also reduces blood levels of triglycerides and slightly increases levels of HDL-cholesterol.|$|E

30|$|Caco- 2 cells act {{similarly}} as cell {{in animals}} when stimulated by fatty acid. van Greevenbroek et al. {{suggested that the}} incorporation of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid and linoleic acid) into the Caco- 2 cells stimulate the secretion of very <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoproteins</b> (VLDL) and chylomicrons. In contrast, administration of saturated fatty acids primarily secretes intermediate- and <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoproteins</b> (IDL and LDL) [27]. Similar findings of increasing chylomicron secretion by the long-chain fatty acids were also reported by Caliph et al. in animal model [28]. In the present investigation, the long-chain fatty acids (Compritol 888 ATO® and oleic acid) used {{in the preparation of}} the HVD-NLCs may also stimulate the secretion of chylomicron, and hence increase the cellular uptake of the model drug.|$|R
25|$|It reduces {{secondary}} outcomes {{associated with}} atherosclerosis, such as low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), very <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoprotein</b> cholesterol (VLDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), but increases high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL).

Other effects include anti-thrombotic and vascular inflammation, improving endothelial function, and plaque stability. Adipokines are the adipocytes’ produced mediators. Some adipokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukins and chemokines, have pro-inflammatory effect and some others such as adiponectin have anti-inflammatory effect that regulates inflammatory process, decrease vascular progression and atherosclerosis.|$|E

One assumption made in the search for an endogenous ligand is that the ligand will be a receptor agonist. However, work by Savouret et al. has shown {{this may not be the}} case since their findings demonstrate that 7-ketocholesterol competitively inhibits Ahr signal transduction.|$|E
25|$|The cleaved SREBP then migrates to the nucleus, {{and acts}} as a {{transcription}} factor to bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), which stimulates the transcription of many genes. Among these are the <b>low-density</b> <b>lipoprotein</b> (LDL) receptor and HMG-CoA reductase. The LDL receptor scavenges circulating LDL from the bloodstream, whereas HMG-CoA reductase leads to an increase of endogenous production of cholesterol. A large part of this signaling pathway was clarified by Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein in the 1970s. In 1985, they received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work. Their subsequent work shows how the SREBP pathway regulates expression of many genes that control lipid formation and metabolism and body fuel allocation.|$|E
40|$|Binding {{of various}} 125 I-lipoproteins to hepatic receptors was studied on cultured human {{hepatoma}} cells (Hep G 2).

Specific binding of Apo E-free LDL was completely abolished in the presence of 3 mM EDTA, indicating that binding to the LDL receptor is calcium dependent. Specific binding of chylomicron remnants was not inhibited by the presence of even 10 mM EDTA. Preincubation of the Hep G 2 cells in lipoprotein-containing medium resulted in complete suppression of LDL receptors but did not affect the remnant receptors.
