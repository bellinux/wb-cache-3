40|$|This work {{analyzed}} multi length-scale composites from {{an experimental}} and modeling perspective. Three main experiments were conducted: fatigue of foam and pin-reinforced foam cores, indentation prevention using load spreaders, and nanotube reinforcement for increased interlaminar strength. A method for determining cycles to failure for a sandwich panel was established using an empirical model. The fatigue response is captured by conducting experiments at varying stress levels to determine empirical constants. Stress-softening is observed in 92 % of tests under varying fatigue cases, even at low stress amplitudes. A stiffness criterion {{can be developed}} to estimate failure such that once a reduced level of stiffness is reached a structure is removed from service. For load spreaders numerical models showed that a stress concentration develops under {{the corner of the}} <b>load</b> <b>spreader.</b> In light of this, a triangular collapse model was derived using a work balance. The model was found to predict the collapse load within 20 N or 12 % of the failure load. For design purposes the model allows the minimum spreader dimension to be determined by inputting the expected load on a joint. Carbon nanotubes were grown on the surface of carbon and glass fibers using CVD. The heat of the reaction and exposure to high temperature were limited to prevent fiber damage. Nanotubes longer than two times the fiber diameter negatively impact the fiber volume fraction which reduces interlaminar strength, but high densities of short nanotubes improve interlaminar strength. Gains of up to 29. 4 % were seen in glass, 56. 2 % were seen in Grafil and 36. 2 % were seen in IM 7...|$|E
40|$|The {{different}} material layers {{as part of}} a {{road construction}} fill all a function so theroad becomes durable, safe, comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. Recently, anew group of construction materials started {{to play an important role}} in roadconstruction – geosynthetics. This thesis addresses the two most common types ofgeosynthetics used in modern road construction, namely geogrids and geotextiles. The most common use of geogrids is reinforcement of poor subgrade by usinggeogrid soil reinforcement, which occurs when road material particles wedge inthe geogrid’s mesh. Geotextiles act partly as a barrier that prevents the finermaterial in the below ground from being mixed with coarser upper material andalso act as a <b>load</b> <b>spreader.</b> Road contractors often face a choice of whether geogrids and/or geotextiles areappropriate in a particular road project and also how much profit the choice mightbring. This phase in the tender calculation process is the intended scope of thisthesis. The thesis deals with both the "hard" cost-function aspects and the "softer" values e. g. ecology and social aspects. To facilitate the comparison, a comparative modelwas developed. The comparison is done for two different cases: Case A – roadconstruction on the bank and Case B – road construction in hill cutting. In Case A “with geogrid”, the amount of trenching becomes smaller due to saving ofreinforcement layer thickness. The completed cost comparison indicates an opportunity for significant savings forroad contractors that choose to strengthen the road’s superstructure with geogrid. In Case A “with geotextile”, no trenching saving is likely, but instead, bearingcapacity improvement is a long term financial gain. An estimated cost for Case B “hill cutting road”, is approximately SEK 600 000 which is less than the cheapestcase i. e. Case A “with geogrid”. After the use of geogrids, the function changes are as following: Traffic load distribution on the terrace has increased and lateral landmovements have reduced Filling material density has increased due to geogrid wedging mechanism Frictional resistance has increased due to the fact that pavement materialparticles have been extended due to geogrid’s wedging mechanism Superstructure’s total thickness has been reduced due reinforcement layerthickness’s reduction After the use of geogrids, the function changes are as following: The composition and function of the road pavement and terrace materialremains intact. (The words "remains intact" run true to the concept of"functional change" but in this case, it is meant that the materialcomposition and function could have been worse if not properly chosengeotextile was added to the design). The scenario "gritty mud" is avoided if the geotextile has been enteredcorrectly with the right overlap. Results concerning the ecological aspects show that the trenching reduction due touse of geogrids leads to fewer ground motion, lesser soil degradation and fewerenvironmental harmful emissions because the use of road construction equipmentdeclines. Reduced distribution excavation thanks to geotextiles leads to both thesame advantages as in the sentence above and partly to the fact that the amount ofmaterials that need become deposited decreases. In addition, the risk ofgroundwater lowering due to artificial drainage ditch is minimized. The road'stotal life cycle is extended, which contributes to reducing the environmentalimpacts arising from road repair and construction of a new road if the old onestops fulfilling its function. Degradation of geogrids and geotextiles is notenvironmentally harmful, but takes a long time in natural conditions, which meansthat in practice, the use must be documented and taken care of (regarding finalcombustion in a prudent manner). Regarding social sustainability, the following conclusion could be drawn: a roadthat has a higher carrying capacity leads to higher traffic safety due to minimalsubsidence, track formation and cracking. Road safety is seen by citizens not onlyas something that the private motorists are responsible for but also something thatroad authorities should consider when planning for a socially sustainable society. Another conclusion is road maintenance frequency and hereby the taxpayers' longtermeconomic gain. The road extended total life cycle contributes to the reductionof road repairs and new construction of roads. In other words, it is not just “oneroad construction company” that wins economically by minimizing their warrantywork. The discussion concerns the cases where geosynthetics are not economicallyoptimal bearing capacity choice, such as solid rock cutting or a stretch of roadwhich has weaker parties but for which, a filling material yet compensates for theexcavated. The report concludes with a special discussion of the Swedishgeosynthetics research. The geosynthetics industry is controlled by private actors(developers, manufacturers and others) and contractors who do not like releasinginformation that might reduce their competitiveness. Therefore, the independentresearcher’s role has been quite weak and mostly reduced to “play ‘catch-up’insofar as investigating the nuances of how geosynthetics work "(Koerner, 2005). Another reason for the lack of reports on geosynthetics benefit is the long term asa sharp research project takes to plan, implement, control and evaluate. WhilstTrafikverket’s and local municipalities’ play the leading role in the Swedish roadconstruction industries, it should be in their interest to start taking geosyntheticsmore seriously by implementing credible tests and full scale trials and publishpractically applicable documents based on objective tests of structures containing geosynthetics...|$|E
50|$|Many modern leathers have armour on {{the inside}} at major impact regions such as shoulders, elbows, hips, knees and back. The European Standards for these protectors are EN 1621-1:2007 and EN 1621-2:2003. The energy {{absorbers}} and <b>load</b> <b>spreaders</b> — constructed from high density foam, foam backed hard polymers, carbon fiber, titanium, and other materials — are designed to prevent or reduce injury by spreading and dampening impact and shear strains to the wearer. In Europe, by law, armour {{has to have a}} CE mark. There are also motorcycle jackets that use an airbag system, which deploys {{in the event of an}} accident, inflating to protect the riders neck, torso, and lower back (see also Airbag and Air bag vest).|$|R

They are designed using materials and seam construction that are impact, abrasion, cut, tear and burst resistant. Tough, strong, moderately flexible boots with stiff soles provide the rider protection from a number of risks. Boots with oil-resistant, rubber-based composite soles give a grip on the pavement and help keep the rider's feet on the pegs. Boots may also have energy absorbers and <b>load</b> <b>spreaders</b> on the shin, inside and outside of each ankle. A stiff sole working laterally helps prevent or decrease crash injuries caused by crushing and shear strain. For boots, the European Standard is EN 13634:2002.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary reason}} that the pattern is altered is because cutting {{off the end of}} the barrel removes the choke, which {{generally}} only extends about two inches (about 5 cm) inward from the muzzle.

A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} characterize soil-vehicle interactions and to measure tractor power/fuel requirements when hauling a fully <b>loaded</b> tank <b>spreader</b> (18 m 3) fitted with rubber tracks (2721 x 635), high flotation tires (28 L 26) or conventional truck tires (445 / 65 R 22. 5). A second objective was to apply an existing soil compaction model to the data from this field trial and to determine if its estimates of wheel rut depth were reasonable. The experiment {{was carried out in}} late autumn on a harvested soybean field (silt loam soil) located in southwestern Ontario. Fuel consumption and drawbar draft were measured during the traffic treatments with an instrumented tractor, and selected soil properties were measured afterwards.

40|$|Objective:This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} root canal obturation employing lateral compaction technique and <b>spreader</b> <b>load</b> of 1. 5 kg on the incidence of complete (CVRF) or incomplete vertical root fractures (IVRF). Material and Methods:  Twenty-seven distal roots of extracted human mandibular molars were used. All root canals were prepared by biomechanical step-back technique and obturated by lateral compaction technique. The prepared roots were distributed into two groups: G 1 - experimental (n= 17) and G 2 - control (n= 10). During obturation, load of 1. 5 kg was applied to a size 30 finger spreader. Pre- and post-obturation images of the coronal portion of the roots were captured by inverted digital microscopy and analyzed by one trained examiner. Data were evaluated by Fisher’s test (p < 0. 05) using GrapH Pad Prism 5. 0. Results: No roots exhibited CVRF. All fractures observed before and after obturation were IVRF or “other defects”. In G 2 (control group), there was no increase of IVRF number. Interestingly, G 1 presented {{an increase in the}} IVRF number to 70, 59 % in the 12 teeth out of 17 teeth studied. The statistical analysis showed that the mean of IVRF increased significantly in G 1 when compared to G 2 (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: The application of a 1. 5 kg <b>spreader</b> <b>load</b> during lateral compaction technique does not produce complete vertical root fractures, but may produce incomplete fractures or “other defects”...|$|R
40|$|Time {{requirements}} for <b>loading</b> a manure <b>spreader</b> and traveling {{to and from}} the field varied from 20 to 30 min per load. However, standardizing the data showed that 5 to 7 min were required per 1, 000 gal (9, 000 lb). The preliminary results of the time motion data indicate about 30 min per cow per year are required for handling manure from a concrete storage basin. These results were consistent among the four dairies evaluated, even though differences existed in operating procedures. These results enable dairy producers to assess labor and equipment needs for performing the various operations associated with hauling manure from a concrete storage basin...|$|R
5000|$|Henry Synck, Jr. {{was born}} in Saint Sebastian, Ohio. He married Wilhelmina Oppenheim, the {{daughter}} of Joseph Oppenheim, a teacher in Maria Stein, Ohio. In 1899 Synck's father-in law, Joseph Oppenheim invented the most {{important component of the}} first practical mechanical manure spreader. Oppenheim conceived the idea of a practical manure spreader during a game of paddle ball. [...] He noted that [...] "when a player held the paddle-shaped bat at an angle, a foul ball resulted, with the ball careening off at the angle dictated by the paddle. Why not, pondered Oppenheim, make manure do the same thing - fly out at an angle from a series of paddles?" [...] Earlier patent ideas, including that described by Kramer, Heckman and Synck (above) had a distributive mechanism that was flawed in that the width of distribution was relatively narrow. Oppenheim subsequently developed a model from a cigar box and demonstrated the feasibility of distributing manure in a [...] "wide spread pattern". Oppenheim's patent clearly describes the distribution mechanism Manure was <b>loaded</b> into the <b>spreader.</b> A mechanism moved the manure to the rear where it was distributed by paddles.|$|R
