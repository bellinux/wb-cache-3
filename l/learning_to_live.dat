Hsing has a child by Hiroshi, but Hiroshi dies soon afterward, of heart failure. The ship's educational curriculum is revised, and all schools are required to allow teachers who are not angels to teach material relevant to living on the new planet. The new planet proves to be habitable by humans, and around a quarter of the ship's population moves to it, settling down despite the difficulty of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on a planet again. The ship leaves, not intending to return.|$|E

25|$|Frontman Justin Pierre {{composed}} the lyrics for Go, which is themed around mortality, growing older, and <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the moment. The reflective tone includes {{subjects such as}} procrastination, relationship miscommunication, and optimism, but also personal struggles such as the death of loved ones. Many songs on Go were developed over years at a time, and several date to the band's first few studio albums. Musically, the album retains the band's pop-rock, Moog-based sound, with a heavier emphasis on electronic experimentation. Following the album's recording, the band entered talks with Epitaph Records, where they were signed from 2003 to 2008. Discussions with label founder Brett Gurewitz led the band to re-sign with Epitaph, who co-released Go alongside the band's own label, The Boombox Generation. It is the final album by the band to feature long-time drummer Tony Thaxton before he announced his departure on March, 20th, 2013.|$|E

500|$|Then, as OPEC members grew {{weary of}} a multi-year supply contest with {{diminishing}} returns and shrinking financial reserves, the organization finally attempted its first production cut since 2008. Despite many political obstacles, a September 2016 decision to trim approximately 1 {{million barrels per}} day was codified by a new quota agreement at the November 2016 OPEC conference. The agreement (which exempted disruption-ridden members Libya and Nigeria) covered the first half of 2017 – alongside promised reductions from Russia and ten other non-members, offset by expected increases in the US shale sector, Libya, Nigeria, spare capacity, and surging late-2016 OPEC production before the cuts took effect. Indonesia announced another [...] "temporary suspension" [...] of its OPEC membership, rather than accepting the organization's requested 5 percent production cut. Prices fluctuated around US$50/bbl, and OPEC in May 2017 decided to extend the new quotas through March 2018, with the world waiting to see if and how the oil inventory glut might be fully siphoned-off by then. Longtime oil analyst Daniel Yergin [...] "described the relationship between OPEC and shale as 'mutual coexistence', with both sides <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with prices that are lower than they would like." ...|$|E

Two of his men, Guzman and Smiley, then enter the lab to locate and kill him, only to be outmaneuvered and eliminated. Durant fires upon him from a helicopter, as Westlake dangles from a cable attached to the aircraft, until he succeeds in causing the helicopter to crash. He impersonates Durant when he meets up with Strack and a captive Julie as Strack plans to make [...] "one less attorney." [...] Westlake's ruse is broken by Strack, who fights him 650 feet above ground. When Westlake gets the upper hand, Strack calls his bluff, saying that killing him would not be something he could live with. Westlake drops Strack, remarking: [...] "I'm <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with a lot of things." [...] Julie tries to convince Westlake that he can still return to his old life, but he tells her he has changed on the inside as well, and can not subject anyone to his new vicious nature. In the final scene, he runs from Julie as they exit an elevator, and is seen from behind pulling on a mask which, when he turns around, reveals the face of Bruce Campbell. During this scene, Westlake can be heard off-screen: [...] "...I am everyone and no one. Everywhere. Nowhere. Call me... Darkman." ...|$|E
