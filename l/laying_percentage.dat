The objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the performance of Japanese quails submitted to forced molting aiming at optimizing the use of the same quail flock by promoting a second laying cycle. A total number of 400 67 -day-old Japanese quails in lay, previously submitted to 14 days of forced molting, was distributed in a completely randomized experimental design into five treatments (T 1 = not submitted to forced molting, T 2 = 03 days of fasting + fed ad libitum, T 3 = 01 days of fasting + 13 days of feed restriction, T 4 = 02 days of fasting + 12 days of feed restriction, and T 5 = 03 days of fasting + 11 days of feed restriction. Feeds were contained equal nutrient levels, and were formulated according to NRC (1994) recommendations. There were significant differences among the studied treatments. Although the treatment of 3 days of fasting followed by ad libitum feeding resulted in lower egg weight, it promoted better <b>lay</b> <b>percentage,</b> egg mass, and feed conversion ratios (FCR/dz and FCR/kg). on the other hand, 3 days of fasting followed by restricted feeding resulted in higher feed intake and worse feed conversion ratios (FCR/dz and FCR/kg).

40|$|Indigenous {{chickens}} in Kenya {{are estimated}} to be 21. 5 million and are found in all the ecological zones in the country. They are 75 % of the poultry population and produce 46 and 58 % of the egg and meat, respectively. These levels of production are comparatively low compared to their numbers. The low productivity of indigenous chickens in Kenya {{and other parts of the}} world is partly attributed to poor management practices, in particular the lack of proper healthcare, poor nutrition and housing. This study was designed to determine the effects of dietary protein levels on egg production, hatchability and post-hatch offspring feed intake, feed efficiency and growth rate of indigenous chickens. Seventy two hens averaging 46 weeks in age, were offered four diets formulated from similar ingredients but differing in protein levels: 100, 120, 140 and 170 g CP/kg DM. Diets were randomly allocated to hens such that each diet had nine replicates each consisting of two hens. The hens were housed in battery cages and diets offered ad-libitum. <b>Laying</b> <b>percentage,</b> egg weight and feed intake were measured over an 8 -week period. There was an increase (p 0. 05) at 120 and 140 g CP/kg DM. The <b>laying</b> <b>percentage</b> of hens offered 170 g CP/kg DM was lower (p 0. 05) on offspring feed intake (51 - 56 g), live weight gain (6. 5 - 8. 5 g / day) and feed conversion efficiency (0. 13 - 0. 15). It is, therefore, concluded that the dietary crude protein requirement for laying indigenous hens is about 120 g CP/kg and maternal dietary protein level has no effect on hatchability and post-hatch offspring feed intake, feed efficiency and growth rate. The findings will help in the formulation of indigenous chicken layer diet with the appropriate protein content...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} employing {{three hundred}} and twenty 81 -week-old Lohmann LSL commercial-breed hens was conducted to compare alternative induced-molting methods with the conventional method (fasting). Induced molting lasted 28 days at most, production and quality being monitored for four periods of 28 days thereafter. A completely randomized experimental design with five treatments, eight replicates of eight birds each per plot was adopted. The following experimental treatments were applied until a loss of 26 % of body weight was reached: T 1 - fasting, T 2 - wheat bran ad libitum, T 3 - rice bran ad libitum, T 4 - cracked rice ad libitum, T 5 - ground alfalfa ad libitum. Birds were then fed production diet ad libitum, except for those on treatment T 1 (fasting) which received 30, 60 and 100 g/bird/day and then feed ad libitum. During induced molting the birds were exposed to a natural photoperiod and at day 28 that period was increased by 30 minutes/week until reaching 16 hours of light/day. The characteristics evaluated during induced molting were: feed intake, body weight changes and <b>laying</b> <b>percentage.</b> In the post-molt period, performance (feed intake, <b>laying</b> <b>percentage,</b> egg weight, egg mass, feed conversion ratio per dozen and per egg mass and percentage of broken eggs) and egg quality (specific gravity, eggshell breaking strength, percentages of eggshell, yolk, and albumen, eggshell thickness, yolk color and Haugh unit) were evaluated. Every 28 days one egg was collected from each repetition for three consecutive days for quality assessment. The use of rice bran and wheat bran is viable as molting inducers since the birds given those treatments display performance and egg quality similar to those fasted during the induced molting and also because these ingredients promote easier handling, {{eliminates the need for}} grinding and feed-mixing equipment and, being less aggressive, provide greater bird welfare...|$|E

Responses were measured as deviations from replicated, unselected control strains. Realized heritabilities averaged. 17 over the seven generations studied. Selection appeared to be equally effective when based on sire-family means whether sire families were separately housed or intermingled in floor-flock environments. Egg mass, measured as daily grams of egg produced per hen housed, increased as much for the full-year period as for the selection period, which began when pullets were 30 weeks old. Correlated responses occurred in terms of decreased age at sexual maturity, increased egg weight, and increased hen-housed rate of lay. Random genetic drift appeared to influence all traits studied. Relatively spacious floor pens and individual-hen cages were associated with essentially equal overall productivity, but 18 -hen colony cages were stressful as indicated by large reductions in part-and full-year egg mass, hen-housed rate of <b>lay,</b> <b>percentage</b> survival, and by increased age at sexual maturity.

Approach: This study aimed at investigating the influence of ten main factors affecting the profitability of layer hen producers. The investigated factors include price of purchased pullet, feed price, cost of labor, cost of veterinary service and medicine, building and machinery depreciation, repairs and maintenance and miscellaneous costs, length of production cycle, feed conversion ratio, mortality rate, egg sale price and <b>laying</b> <b>percentage.</b> Results: The study used a multiple regression profit model to estimate {{the effect of the}} above mentioned factors on profit per kg egg produced. The direction and quantity of relationship between profit per kg egg and variables affecting profit were investigated. Data from 40 operating and randomly selected egg production enterprises in the country was collected. Data was obtained directly from the producers during April to mid August 2010. Semi structured interviews were conducted with a pre-tested questionnaire. The data obtained via interview surveys were processed to calculate profit per kg egg and other relevant information for inclusion in a profit function model. Fifteen eggs are registered to be 1 kg in the study. Cost and income items used to calculate profit in the study. The results of the study revealed that the feed price was found to be the factor which has the highest negative impact on the profitability showing the coefficient- 3. 01. The egg sale price was with high positive impact on profitability showing the coefficient 2. 633.

40|$|This {{research}} project consisted of five experiments. The main {{objective of this}} study was to determine the effects of restricted feeding and season on growth, carcass characteristics, meat chemical composition, reproduction and egg laying performance of Koekoek chickens. Feed restriction lowered the body weight, weight gain, feed intake and improved the feed conversion efficiency during the rearing phase. During the laying phase, chickens that were in the RA treatment had higher body weights, weight gains and lower FCR. Chickens that were reared in summer had a higher body weight, weight gain and FCR, while total feed intake and mortality rates were high in winter. Feed restriction reduced the slaughter weight, defeathered weight, dressed weight, skin weight, breast muscle weight, shank width, chest width and heart girth during the rearing phase. The intestine, liver and abdominal fat pad weights were higher in chickens that were fed ad libitum. Chickens that were reared in summer had higher shank width, slaughter weight, defeathered weight, chest width, heart girth, breast muscle weight, skin weight, abdominal fat pad weight, intestine weight, liver weight and the relative skin percentage at the age of 18 weeks. During the laying phase, abdominal fat pad weight, abdominal fat pad percentage, intestine percentage, liver weight, gizzard weight and gizzard percentage were higher in the ad libitum fed chickens. Unrestricted feeding during the rearing phase increased the development of combs, wattles, pubic bones, ovaries and oviducts more than restricted feeding while at the age of 32 weeks, enhanced growth of the reproductive organs was seen in chickens that were fed ad libitum only during the laying phase (RA). The cold winter conditions hindered the growth of the combs, wattles, pubic bones, oviducts and ovaries. Restricted feeding during the laying phase reduced the <b>laying</b> <b>percentage,</b> egg weights and improved the hatching percentage.

At the end of growing phase the birds were allotted in cages and fed the same diet without PRB at laying phase. At growing phase, the inclusion of PRB up to 5 % promoted linear reduction in dry matter and gross energy digestibilities of diet; however a linear increase in metabolizable energy was noted. Feed intake, weight gain and final weight were reduced but not altering feed:gain ratio and body composition. At laying phase, the inclusion of PRB increased the age at first egg production but no influence was verified at age to reach 50 % of egg production. No effect was verified at <b>laying</b> <b>percentage,</b> feed intake, weight and egg mass and feed:gain ratio. In economical evaluation, the inclusion of up to 25 % of parboiled rice bran provided best economical indexes. The inclusion of PRB Japanese quails diets at growing phase can be recommended in levels up to 25 %, without incurring future losses at laying phase...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to improve {{knowledge}} on the effect of group size on productive performance and egg quality of hens raised in furnished cages equally designed. A total of 520, 15 -week-old Lohmann Brown laying hens were divided into 2 groups to have a similar initial body weight (average 1392 ± 16. 3 g). The cages of S 25 group (240 L x 78 W x 50 H cm, 749 cm 2 /hen) hosted a total of 200 hens, while those of S 40 group (462 L x 65 W x 50 H, 751 cm 2 /hen) included 320 birds. Experimental data were recorded after an adaptation period of 5 weeks (20 to 36 weeks of age). Hens were submitted to 15 h of light/d. The average temperature inside the building was 24. 6 ± 2. 5 °C over the entire experimental period with higher values at 24, 26, 28 and 30 weeks of age. The relative humidity recorded inside the building was 55 % at week 20 and 60 % all through the experimental period. Hens raised from S 40 group had lower percentage of egg production (84. 91 vs 88. 90 %, P< 0. 01) and higher feed conversion ratio (2. 70 vs 2. 25, P< 0. 0001) than S 25 group. The percentage of eggs laid out of the nest was higher in S 25 than S 40 group (0. 26 vs 0. 19 %, P< 0. 01). As expected, the week of age affected almost all the parameters (feed intake, body weight, <b>laying</b> <b>percentage,</b> egg weight, yolk, shell and albumen indexes, shell thickness, Haugh unit). However, the effect of group size was particularly evident during the hot period...|$|E
40|$|Six hundred {{guinea fowl}} pullets, 5 week old, {{were used for}} a 30 week feeding trial to test the {{replacement}} value of poultry droppings (PD) for blood meal, a conventional protein ingredient, in animal feed. Guinea fowl is a wild bird found in the savanna forests of West Africa. There were four dietary treatments namely, 0, 20, 40 and 60 % PD replacement of blood meal. The birds were kept in deep litter houses for 20 weeks. Feed and water were offered ad libitum. At the 20 th week, 10 birds {{were randomly selected from}} each of the four dietary treatments and starved for one day. They were killed in the slaughter house by cutting the neck through the jugular vein. This was used to determine the carcass parameters. The remaining birds were transferred into the layers house, where the following parameters were determined: body weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion, age at first <b>lay,</b> <b>Percentage</b> hen day production, egg weight, shell thickness and yolk colour. Results show that body weight gain and feed conversion decreased with the level of PD in the diet. There {{was no significant difference between}} the birds in carcass parameters in all the treatments except in oviduct length where its values decreased with the level of PD in the diet and significant differences (P< 0. 05) were observed among the birds raised on 0 and 60 % PD. The birds on 0 % PD attained point of lay two weeks earlier than those on 60 % PD. And there was a significant difference (P< 0. 05) between the birds on 0 % PD and those on 60 % PD diets in age at first lay. However, there was no significant difference among birds raised on diets with PD below 60 % PD. Feed intake increased with the level of PD and there was a significant difference (P 0 < 0. 05) between those raised on 0 and 60 % PD diets. Mortality was very low as only two birds were recorded dead in the 60 % PD diet throughout the experimental period. It was concluded that PD can be used to replace blood meal in the diet of guinea fowl up to 40 % without any adverse effect on its performance...|$|R
50|$|P. annularis {{has been}} found to exhibit slight {{variations}} in its colony cycle from year to year based on environmental conditions, in part due to the ability of females to switch castes. Typically, the largest and top-ranking female founds a nest and <b>lays</b> the largest <b>percentage</b> of eggs, while subordinates forage. After workers emerge from the eggs, many of the subordinate foundresses disappear; the nest usually loses its original queen before more eggs can be laid {{at the end of the}} season. A worker with fully developed ovaries takes over the nest and becomes a gyne. Earlier queen death corresponds to an earlier arrest in rearing brood, which may be due to a decrease in relatedness between the new queen and the nascent females, or due to internal conflict on the nest. Additionally, if resources decrease, such as during a drought, brood rearing ends sooner than in more prosperous years, and females choose to become gynes as opposed to workers. Many of these variations can be rationalized via relatedness.|$|R
40|$|Pebrine {{disease in}} tasar {{silkworm}} {{is considered to}} be most serious because of its chronic pathogenicity. Prophylactic method of mother moth examination proves to be the foolproof technique for pebrine identification. So, the study was conducted to investigate pebrine spores detection competency and evaluation of their quality in exhisting mother moth examinations. Four existing mother moth examination methods namely Prick and See, Conventional, Fuziwara and Delayed Mother Moth Examination (DMME) by Fuziwara were selected for the study. The maximum pebrine and hatching percentages were noticed in 4 days DMME with 23. 2 and 93. 1 %, respectively. While, minimum values were observed in prick and see with 4. 3 % and 84. 3, respectively. No significant variations in Cocoon weight, Shell weight and S. R% was observed in cocoons obtained from the different mother moth testing methods. Least percentage of effective rate of rearing (ERR) was observed in Prick and See method (58. 75 %) followed by Conventional method (61. 25 %) and Fuziwara (63. 15 %). High percentage of ERR was observed in DMME which ranged from 64. 53 % (1 st day after egg laying) to 67. 28 % (4 th day after egg <b>laying).</b> Least <b>percentage</b> of improvement of ERR% over Prick and See was observed in Conventional (2. 50 %) followed by Fuziwara (4. 40 %). High percentage of ERR over Prick and See was observed in DMME which ranged from 5. 78 % (1 st day) to 8. 53 % (4 th day). Consequently, among the tested mother moth examinations, DMME by Fuziwara after delaying four days from the egg laying has given best results. This method can be implemented in the research institutions for the maintenance of germplasm and breeders stock...|$|R
40|$|Restricted {{feeding of}} broiler breeders is {{required}} to obtain good reproductive performance. Current practical feed restriction levels can result in hunger feeling and chronic stress, particularly during the rearing period. On the basis of literature data, low-density diets might improve bird welfare. Recent findings also indicate that low-density broiler breeder diets can reduce offspring mortality. In this thesis, effects of low-density breeder diets on bird welfare and breeder and offspring performance were evaluated. Breeder treatments involved: 1) normal density diets (ND), 2) diets with 12 and 11 % reduced nutrient densities during rearing and laying (LD 12 and LD 11), 3) diets with 23 and 21 % reduced nutrient densities during rearing and laying (LD 23 and LD 21), 4) as 2), but with oats and sugar beet pulp instead of palm kernel meal, wheat bran, wheat gluten feed and sunflower seed meal in the diets (LD 12 OP and LD 11 OP), and 5) LD 11 diets during rearing followed by ND diets during laying. Feeding LD 23 diets reduced stereotypic pecking behaviour and increased time spent on sitting {{during the first half}} of the rearing period. LD 23 and LD 12 OP diets reduced feed intake motivation during rearing. It was concluded that LD 23 can improve bird welfare {{during the first half of}} the rearing period. However, LD 21 impaired bird welfare during laying. LD 12 OP and LD 11 OP diets gave significantly lower live weights during rearing and laying. Low-density diets delayed reproductive tract development at 24 weeks of age, which was followed by an increased development between week 24 and 26. Changes in bird development were related to changes in nutrient digestibility and utilization of digested nutrients. Egg weights and amount of egg white increased and embryonic development was improved on low-density diets. <b>Laying</b> <b>percentage</b> was significantly higher on LD 11 diets. LD 11 diets increased live weight of offspring of 29 -week-old breeders significantly in comparison with ND diets. Low-density breeder diets resulted in a significant reduction in offspring mortality when breeders were 60 weeks of age. Antibody titres in offspring indicated that nutrients in eggs with a relatively low weight were used for growth rather than for immune system development. It was concluded that low-density broiler breeder diets can improve offspring performance and offspring vitality...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to evaluate levels of methionine + cystine levels for broiler breeders from 40 to 60 weeks of age. It was used 288 Cobb broiler breeders, distributed in a randomized experimental design with six levels of methionine+ cystine in the diets (0. 39; 0. 47; 0. 55; 0. 63; 0. 71 and 0. 79 %), eight repetitions and six breeders per experimental unit. The diets were isocaloric and isoprotein (2, 850 kcal ME/kg and 12. 58 % CP) and oferred at a fixed amount (155 g) per bird. For the entire studied period, by using polynomial analysis, it was observed a quadratic effect of methionine + cystine levels on the percentage of egg production, on number of eggs per hen housed, on number of eggs per hen and egg weight. There was also a linear effect on shell weight when it was calculated in relation to egg weight. The total methionine + cystine requirement for broiler breeders was calculated at 0. 521 % for percentage of egg production and number of eggs per hen, which corresponds to a daily intake of 808 mg of methionine + cystine/day. The digestible methionine + cystine requirement for broiler breeders was estimated at 727 mg for <b>laying</b> <b>percentage</b> and number of eggs per hen. Com o objetivo de avaliar níveis de metionina + cistina para matrizes pesadas de 40 a 60 semanas de idade, conduziu-se um experimento com 288 matrizes da linhagem Cobb- 500, distribuídas em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com seis níveis de metionina + cistina nas dietas (0, 39; 0, 47; 0, 55; 0, 63; 0, 71 e 0, 79 %), oito repetições e seis matrizes por unidade experimental. As rações foram isocalóricas e isoproteicas (2. 850 kcal EM/kg e 12, 58 % PB) e fornecidas em quantidade fixa (155 g) por ave. No período total estudado, por meio de análise polinomial, foi observado efeito quadrático dos níveis de metionina + cistina sobre o percentual de produção de ovos, o número de ovos por ave alojada, o número de ovos por ave e o peso dos ovos. Houve também efeito linear sobre o peso da casca quando calculado em relação ao peso dos ovos. A exigência de metionina + cistina total para matrizes pesadas foi estimada em 0, 521 % para percentual de produção de ovos e número de ovos por ave, o que corresponde a uma ingestão diária de 808 mg de metionina + cistina total.

El diseño fue completamente aleatorizado y se evaluaron dos tratamientos: T 1) dieta basal (control) y T 2) dieta basal más la mezcla de biopreparados, en proporción 1 : 1. Se utilizaron 2 078 gallinas ponedoras L 33, con una edad entre 40 y 48 semanas (1 039 aves por tratamiento), las cuales se alojaron en jaulas metálicas y recibieron agua y alimento a base de maíz-soya. Los huevos se recogieron cada día y se determinó el número total de posturas y el de huevos por ave por semana, el consumo de alimento y la conversión en posturas por kilogramo de alimento consumido.

A total of 69 pairs and 516 offspring from 82 breeding attempts were examined. Only 18 offspring (3. 5 %) in seven different nests were not fathered by the attending male. The sample included one brood in which all nine chicks were fathered by an extra-pair male. One chick from a nest of eight {{was the result of}} intra-specific brood parasitism. Three chicks from a brood of nine could be matched with the male but not with the female. Observations at this nestbox suggested that mate switching had occurred during the <b>laying</b> period. The <b>percentage</b> of extra-pair fertilizations did not differ between first clutches and (experimentally induced) replacement clutches.

40|$|The {{single most}} {{important}} environmental variable correlating with annual survival of both juvenile and adult Great Tits Parus major is the beech crop index (BCI). This index is a measure {{for the amount of}} seeds of beeches present in the winter, and correlates with crop size of several other tree species. Two, not mutually exclusive, hypotheses exist to explain the correlation between BCI and annual survival. The first is that the amount of seeds directly affects survival (winter-food limitation hypothesis). To test this hypothesis we re-analysed a supplemental food experiment of Van Balen (1980), extended with three more years of previously unpublished data. We found that supplemental food increased survival of both juveniles and adults, mainly in low BCI years, confirming the winter-food limitation hypothesis. The second hypothesis states that winters with a high BCI are preceded by springs with high densities of caterpillars (the breeding-season food limitation hypothesis). Using data of three long term studies of Dutch Great Tit populations we show that this hypothesis does not hold because (1) high BCI winters are not preceded by springs with high caterpillar densities, (2) annual mean juvenile fledging mass increased with increasing caterpillar densities, but no effect on parental mass was found, and (3) the annual survival of juveniles was not affected by the annual mean fledging mass, nor was annual adult survival affected by their mean mass during chick rearing. Finally we show that, {{despite the fact that the}} level of BCI probably can be predicted at the time of the breeding season and that both juvenile and adult survival is affected by BCI, reproductive decisions (clutch size, <b>laying</b> date and <b>percentage</b> second broods) are not affected by the BCI levels in the following winter.
