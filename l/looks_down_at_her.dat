500|$|The video, which Beyoncé has {{considered}} intimate and romantic, begins as she stands against a wall, illuminated by light that {{passes through a}} window. In one scene, Beyoncé's character, dressed in a skin-tight leotard, performs a dance sequence while her love interest <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> from a balcony. According to Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly, the dance routines pay homage to the 1983 romantic drama film Flashdance. Beyoncé and Ealy later stare adoringly {{at each other as}} they snuggle on a sofa. During the climax of the video, Beyoncé is shown underwater, dressed in white, moving slowly upwards. As the chorus begins, she opens her eyes; after Ealy kisses the back of her neck, the pair come face to face in the final scene, in which Beyoncé lies in bed, with Ealy above her. Jennifer Cady of E! Online wrote that the bright shiny lights in the video [...] "make [...] look like an angel". Alison Maloney of The Sun praised Beyoncé's [...] "amazing figure". The video was ranked at number 74 on BET's Notarized: Top100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E
60|$|He {{straightens}} himself, recoils a step, and <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in a dread amazement; for {{he seems}} to know her.|$|E
60|$|As he <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{she looks}} up at him, and whimpers: ‘My lungs is weakly; my lungs is dreffle bad. Poor me, poor me, my cough is {{rattling}} dry!’ and coughs in confirmation horribly.|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face, luminous, quivering with excitement--and understood.|$|R
60|$|He {{laughed a}} little, boyishly, {{as he stood}} <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R

50|$|Other {{customers}} are Jeanne's previous colleagues. Jeanne was a cashier {{in a supermarket}} before she became manager of her own shop. She now <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> former colleagues and considers {{them as part of}} the lower class.|$|E
5000|$|John escapes {{the mound}} with Louisa and blocks the tunnel with the leaking fuel canister, but another mound-walker {{is already there}} outside. Louisa collapses and begs her father not to leave her. John <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and sees her {{beginning}} to transform {{into one of the}} creatures. He drops a flare into the leaking diesel fuel and the mound goes up in a huge explosion. As Sam watches, the flames are reflected on the glass of the frame. A figure is seen emerging, although its identity is unclear. Sam asks, [...] "Daddy?", as shadows can also be seen moving in the trees and house behind him. A growling creature emerges directly behind him as the screen goes black.|$|E
50|$|Samir and Marie {{discuss the}} events and their relationship. Marie decides that they should focus on their future, while Samir appears conflicted. Ahmad prepares to return to Iran. He says {{farewell}} to the children and attempts to talk to Marie {{about the end of}} their marriage, but Marie does not let him, stating that she doesn't need to know such things now. Meanwhile, Samir visits his wife in hospital with a selection of perfumes, which the doctors have recommended in order to possibly initiate a response. He sprays on some of his cologne and leans over her, asking her to squeeze his hand if she can smell it. A tear runs down her face and he <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> hand, which is holding his.|$|E
60|$|Hetty smiled faintly {{and put her}} arm within his. Adam <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> but {{her eyes}} were turned dreamily towards another corner of the garden.|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{with a quick}} frown. Decidedly he was annoyed.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> dress half despondently, and {{yet with}} some pride.|$|R
50|$|The {{painting}} measures 180.3 cm high by 114.9 cm wide. It {{depicts a}} busy street scene in Paris, {{with most of the}} people depicted using umbrellas against the rain. To the right, a mother <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> daughters, each fashionably dressed in the styles of 1881 for the afternoon promenade. She largely conceals a female figure at the centre of the frame, caught in the act of raising or lowering her umbrella, suggesting that the rain is about to start or stop. The principal female figure {{to the left of the}} frame, a milliner's assistant or modiste modelled by Renoir's lover and frequent subject Suzanne Valadon, holds up her skirt against the mud and water on the road as she carries a hatbox, but has no hat, raincoat or umbrella.|$|E
50|$|The {{first part}} is an {{extension}} of the first person accounts previously supplied by Mendoza, which accounts are apparently previous chapters in her journal, written on any material she can get. Somehow all of this manages to stay intact for the unknown amount of time, perhaps 3000 years, that Mendoza spends in exile on Santa Catalina. The period is uncertain because Mendoza herself cannot remember living through some portions of it. From time to time she <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> plants, and next time she looks up months or years have slipped by. She may just be doing the cyborg version of 'zoning out', but since she has already slipped forward in time once, there's no telling what might be happening. What is certain is that she is about 150,000 years in the past, growing fruit and vegetables for a Company resort on Santa Cruz island.|$|E
5000|$|He {{looks at}} her and says, [...] "I really had you fooled didn't I?" [...] Gail lets out {{a sigh of relief}} {{figuring}} he was pulling a prank on her. Phil continues saying, [...] "Had you real scared". Gail, upset, replies [...] "Phil, will you cut it out", showing fear. Phil then says in a raspy creepy voice [...] "Are you in the house alone?". Phil then reveals that it wasn't a prank and that he's been stalking her, that he knows all about her, he knows what she likes, he's been watching her a long time, he's been real patient, that he's waited for her, and not to give him that [...] "lily white virgin" [...] stuff cause he knows she has nothing to lose. He then attacks her, forces her down on the ground and proceeds to rape her. He sits up sweaty, <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> beaten bloody body and runs out of the house.|$|E

I was to think of it, and could speak to her by the church. So I went there to thank her.' ...|$|R

40|$|Children {{are often}} {{compared}} to scientists, {{but even a}} perfect scientist, using experiments alone, would struggle to redis-cover all of human knowledge {{in the span of}} one lifetime. How then are children able to acquire a good fraction of this knowledge in just a few years? The answer must be that chil-dren do not discover everything they learn—they use their ability to reason intuitively about other people to learn what others already know. Our goal in this article is to sketch a for-mal analysis of learning from knowledgeable others that is based on Bayesian inference and a careful examination of the kinds of goals that give rise to human actions. We begin by addressing the need of learners to consider the particular goals of people in their environment. Imagine that while living in Paris, you decide to search for the best cup of coffee in the city. As you wander, you find your-self a good distance away from your neighborhood. You observe three pieces of evidence: First, a man wearing a baseball cap and an “I Heart Paris ” T-shirt (obviously a tourist) turns into Cafe 1, buys a coffee, and looks down at his cup. Second, Véronique, a woman from your neighborhood, enters Cafe 2 to get a coffee, and <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> cup. Third, Madeleine, another woman from your neighborhood, goes into Cafe 3 and buys a cup. Madeleine sees you, and she nods at the coffee. Which cafe would you think has the best coffee? You can infer very little about the coffee at Cafe 1, because the tourist likely chose the cafe at random. Cafe 2 was visited by a local, but maybe Véronique was just strapped for time and grabbed a cuppa wherever she could. Without knowing her motivations, you can’t tell whether she had gone {{out of her way to}} go to this particular cafe (though you may guess at her motivations, and hence guess her beliefs about the cafe). On the other hand, at Cafe 3, Madeleine telegraphed her intentions to you: She was there for the coffee, and she congratulated you for figuring out a local secret. Although nothing is certain (for example, Mad-eleine could have terrible taste), Cafe 3 seems likely to have the best coffee, and Cafe 2 is likely to have better coffee tha...|$|E
