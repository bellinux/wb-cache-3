5|$|Nurkse {{argued against}} {{the notion that}} a <b>large</b> <b>population</b> implies a large market. Though {{underdeveloped}} countries have a <b>large</b> <b>population,</b> their levels of productivity are low. This results in low levels of per capita real income. Thus, consumption expenditure is low, and savings are either very low or completely absent. On the other hand, developed countries have smaller populations than underdeveloped countries but by virtue of high levels of productivity, their per capita real incomes are higher and thus they create a large market for goods and services.|$|E

50|$|Bangladesh and South Korea {{are larger}} and more densely {{populated}} (hence have a <b>larger</b> <b>population),</b> and only Taiwan is smaller and has a <b>larger</b> <b>population</b> (hence a <b>larger</b> <b>population</b> density). There are 21 more countries (12 independent ones and 9 dependent territories) with a <b>larger</b> <b>population</b> density, but they all have a smaller population (hence a smaller area). If the water area is not counted then Taiwan is larger, and there are 16 more countries (9 independent ones and 7 dependent territories) with a <b>larger</b> <b>population</b> density.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{essential}} requirements for an introduced plant species to become invasive is an ability to reproduce outside the native range, particularly when initial populations are small. If a reproductive Allee effect is operating, plants in small populations will have reduced reproductive success relative to plants in <b>larger</b> <b>populations.</b> Alternatively, if plants in small populations experience less competition for pollination than those in <b>large</b> <b>populations,</b> they may actually {{have higher levels of}} reproductive success than plants in <b>large</b> <b>populations.</b> To resolve this uncertainty, we investigated how the per capita fecundity of plants was affected by population size in three invasive milkweed species. Field surveys of seed production in natural populations of different sizes but similar densities were conducted for three pollinator-dependent invasive species, namely Asclepias curassavica, Gomphocarpus fruticosus and G. physocarpus. Additionally, supplemental hand-pollinations were performed in small and <b>large</b> <b>populations</b> in order to determine whether reproductive output was limited by pollinator activity in these populations. Reproductive Allee effects were not detected in any of the study species. Instead, plants in small populations exhibited remarkably high levels of reproductive output compared to those in <b>large</b> <b>populations.</b> Increased fruit production following supplemental hand-pollinations suggested that the lower reproductive output of naturally pollinated plants in <b>large</b> <b>populations</b> is a consequence of pollen limitation rather than limitation due to abiotic resources. This is consistent with increased intraspecific competition for pollination amongst plants in <b>large</b> <b>populations.</b> It is likely that the invasion of these milkweed species in Australia has been enhanced because plants in small founding populations experience less intraspecific competition for pollinators than those in <b>large</b> <b>populations,</b> and thus have the ability to produce copious amounts of seeds...|$|R
5|$|None of {{the major}} {{subspecies}} is under threat, but exsul, as noted above, is probably extinct. There is a slow population increase of common chiffchaff in the Czech Republic. The range of at least P. c. collybita seems to be expanding, with northward advances in Scotland, Norway and Sweden and a <b>large</b> <b>population</b> increase in Denmark.|$|E

5|$|Texas's <b>large</b> <b>population,</b> {{abundance}} of natural resources, thriving cities and leading centers {{of higher education}} have contributed to a large and diverse economy. Since oil was discovered, the state's economy has reflected {{the state of the}} petroleum industry. In recent times, urban centers of the state have increased in size, containing two-thirds of the population in 2005. The state's economic growth has led to urban sprawl and its associated symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{is closely}} related to some other members of its genus. It has a number of subspecies, some of which are distinctive enough to be potential new species.

The <b>large</b> <b>population</b> and its vast range explain why the mourning dove is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species is not at immediate risk.

5|$|The {{pink-backed pelican}} has a <b>large</b> <b>population</b> ranging {{over much of}} Sub-Saharan Africa.

5|$|The red-billed chough has an {{extensive}} range, estimated at 10millionsquare kilometres (3.8million sq mi), and a <b>large</b> <b>population,</b> including an estimated 86,000 to 210,000 individuals in Europe.
