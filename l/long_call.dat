5|$|A loon’s wail is a <b>long</b> <b>call</b> {{consisting}} {{of up to}} three notes, and is often compared to a wolf’s howl. It uses this call to communicate its location to other loons. The call is given {{back and forth between}} breeding pairs or an adult and its chick, either to maintain contact or in an attempt to move closer together after being separated. It is a loud aaoo, weee-wea weee-wea weee-wea, or ooo-aaah-éééé.|$|E
5|$|The alpine pika can emit three {{different}} vocalizations. The <b>long</b> <b>call</b> is heard during the mating season from only the subspecies O. a. alpina, O. a. changaica, and O. a. nitida. The short call is a harsh, sharp whistle that is easily distinguishable from the short high-pitched whistle {{of the northern}} pika. The alarm call is given out immediately any danger from predators or humans is perceived, and can travel greater distances than the calls of most other pika species.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} plan for the future beyond {{immediate}} needs would be adaptive to many animal species, but is widely thought to be uniquely human. Although studies in captivity have shown that great apes are capable of planning for future needs, it is unknown whether and how they use this ability in the wild. Flanged male Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) emit <b>long</b> <b>calls,</b> which females use to maintain earshot associations with them. We tested whether <b>long</b> <b>calls</b> serve to communicate a male’s ever-changing predominant travel direction to facilitate maintaining these associations. We found that the direction in which a flanged male emits his <b>long</b> <b>calls</b> predicts his subsequent travel direction for many hours, and that a new call indicates a change in his main travel direction. <b>Long</b> <b>calls</b> given at or near the night nest indicate travel direction better than random until late afternoon on the next day. These results show that male orangutans make their travel plans well in advance and announce them to conspecifics. We suggest that such a planning ability is likely to be adaptive for great apes, as well as in other taxa...|$|R
25|$|Investors who {{primarily}} {{trade in}} futures may hedge their futures against synthetic futures. A synthetic {{in this case}} is a synthetic future comprising a call and a put position. Long synthetic futures means <b>long</b> <b>call</b> and short put at the same expiry price. To hedge against a long futures trade a short position in synthetics can be established, and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the typical}} {{cotton-top}} tamarin communicative vocalizations, the combination <b>long</b> <b>call</b> (CLC) and the alarm call (AC) {{are the most}} heavily represented in the literature. CLCs encompass a range of contact calls that are produced by isolated individuals using chirps and whistles. This type of call is also used for seemingly altruistic alarm calls, thus adding to its range of cooperative behaviors. It is issued {{in the presence of}} kin when a threatening llamas predator is seen. Predators of the cotton-top tamarin include snakes, ocelots, tayras, and most notably, hawks. Early observations by Patricia Neyman even showed that cotton-tops produce diverse sets of alarm calls that can discriminate the presence of birds of prey versus ground-based predators.|$|E
500|$|The alpine pika (Ochotona alpina), {{also known}} as [...] "Alta Pika", [...] "Altaischer Pfeighase", [...] "Pika de l'atai", and [...] "Pika alpina", is a species of small mammal in the pika family, Ochotonidae. The summer pelage of {{different}} subspecies varies drastically but, in general, it is dark or cinnamon brown, turning to grey with a yellowish tinge during the winter. It is found in western Mongolia, eastern Kazakhstan, and Russia (Tuva, Irkutsk, Altai, and Krasnoyarsk), {{as well as in}} China (northern Xinjiang and Heilongjiang), in very cold, mountainous regions. It is a generalist herbivore, and mainly forages on mosses, tree branches, pine nuts, and plant stems. It can emit three series of different vocalizations: a <b>long</b> <b>call,</b> a short call, and an alarm call. It is rated as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} mate-quality {{recognition}} in passerines showed that females use subtle differences in sound production to assess males. We analysed <b>long</b> <b>calls</b> of brown skuas, Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi, {{to test whether}} vocal performance could serve {{as an indicator of}} individual quality in a nonpasserine species. Measurements of vocal performances focused on two acoustic parameters for which motor constraints have been reported in passerines, namely ‘vocal deviation’ and ‘peak performance’. As potential indicators of individual quality we measured body size, body condition (body mass corrected for size) and mean reproductive success. We found a triangular distribution of calls between note repetition rate and frequency bandwidth. Males performing <b>long</b> <b>calls</b> closer to the performance limit had a higher mean reproductive success than males that show <b>long</b> <b>calls</b> with a larger vocal deviation. Similarly, males calling with a high peak performance were more successful breeders than males with low peak performance. Our findings indicate that <b>long</b> <b>calls</b> of brown skuas are limited by motor constraints similar to vocalizations in passerines. We show that differences in vocal performance reflect male's reproductive success with more successful breeders producing the more difficult calls. This implies that limits on vocal performance due to motor constraints present a suitable mechanism for mate-quality recognition in nonpasserine birds. ...|$|R

500|$|Another interviewee, François, {{a middle-aged}} woodcutter who {{spent time in}} the forests inland (east) from the main road between Morondava and Belo sur Mer, and five of his friends, {{reported}} seeing kidoky recently. [...] Their description of the animal and François's imitation of its <b>long</b> <b>call</b> were virtually identical to Pascou's. [...] One {{of the young men}} insisted that its fur had a lot of white in it, but the other men could not confirm that. François and his friends reported that it had never climbed a tree in their presence, and that it flees on the ground in short leaps or bounds. [...] When Burney imitated the sideways leaping of a sifaka moving on the ground, one of the men corrected him, pointing out that he was imitating a sifaka. [...] The man's imitation of the gallop kidoky used was very baboon-like. The men also reported that imitating its call can draw the animal closer and cause it to continue calling.|$|E
2500|$|The {{themes of}} Deuteronomy in {{relation}} to Israel are election, faithfulness, obedience, and God's promise of blessings, all expressed through the covenant: [...] "obedience is not primarily a duty imposed by one party on another, but an expression of covenantal relationship." [...] Yahweh has chosen ("elected") Israel as his special property (Deuteronomy 7:6 and elsewhere), and Moses stresses to the Israelites the need for obedience to God and covenant, {{and the consequences of}} unfaithfulness and disobedience. Yet the first several chapters of Deuteronomy are a long retelling of Israel's past disobedience – but also God's gracious care, leading to a <b>long</b> <b>call</b> to Israel to choose life over death and blessing over curse (chapters 7–11).|$|E
