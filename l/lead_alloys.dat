5|$|The largest {{consumer}} of tellurium is metallurgy in iron, stainless steel, copper, and <b>lead</b> <b>alloys.</b> The addition to steel and copper produces an alloy more machinable than otherwise. It is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy, where {{the presence of}} electrically conductive free graphite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results. In lead, tellurium improves strength and durability, and decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|When no {{porosity}} {{is allowed}} {{in a cast}} part then the pore-free casting process is used. It {{is identical to the}} standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot to purge any air from the mold cavity. This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat treated and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and <b>lead</b> <b>alloys.</b>|$|E

50|$|Match pellets {{are made}} of soft <b>lead</b> (a <b>lead</b> <b>alloy</b> with low {{antimony}} content). The antimony content is used to control the hardness of the soft <b>lead</b> <b>alloy.</b> It is a very soft alloy, which {{makes it easy to}} process. Since the soft <b>lead</b> <b>alloy</b> is prone to strongly deform when striking a bullet catcher, it rapidly loses its kinetic energy and will not easily bounce off. Lead is toxic and hazardous to the environment, so that when shooting with lead pellets precautions should be taken.|$|R

25|$|For over 40 years, the FBI {{crime lab}} in Quantico had {{believed}} that <b>lead</b> <b>alloys</b> used in bullets had unique chemical signatures. It was analyzing the bullets {{with the goal}} of matching them chemically, not only to a single batch of ammunition coming out of a factory, but also to a single box of bullets. The National Academy of Sciences conducted an 18-month independent review of comparative bullet-lead analysis. In 2003, its National Research Council published a report whose conclusions called into question 30 years of FBI testimony. It found the analytic model used by the FBI for interpreting results was deeply flawed, and the conclusion, that bullet fragments could be matched to a box of ammunition, was so overstated that it was misleading under the rules of evidence. One year later, the FBI decided to stop conducting bullet lead analyses.|$|E

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the change of}} surface properties and the reaction process of <b>lead</b> <b>alloy</b> anode in CrO 3 solution under conditions of high current density, by means of SEM, EDX, XRD, electrochemical test and Raman spectroscopy, for understanding the corrosion mechanism of <b>lead</b> <b>alloy</b> anode. In the initial oxidation stage of <b>lead</b> <b>alloy</b> anode, the diffraction peaks of monoclinic PbCrO 4 and PbO are clearly shown in the XRD spectrum of the <b>lead</b> <b>alloy</b> surface. With increasing reaction time, PbCrO 4 and PbO diffraction peaks are weakened and those of lead dioxide strengthened. Cyclic voltammetry reveals that the electrode potential change is among Pb, PbO, PbCrO 4, PbO 1 +x (0 < x < 1) and β-PbO 2. According to impedance tests, charge transfer and a corrosion product film on <b>lead</b> <b>alloy</b> surface happen under the high and medium frequencies, and chromium-oxide ion clusters are absorbed on free sites of the anode surface for the low frequency. The corrosion products have characteristic of complex semiconducting behavior shown in the Mott–Schottky plots. Raman spectra indicates that Cr 2 O 72 − and HCrO 4 − ions are firstly absorbed on the anode surface, and then PbCrO 4 is produced between Cr 2 O 72 − and Pb, PbO is reacted from HCrO 4 −. The mechanism of the anode reaction at the anode/solution interface is discussed using the experimental results. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

50|$|Although some bullet casting {{procedures}} can {{be accomplished}} with heating elements used for cooking; {{care must be taken}} to avoid contaminating food preparation areas and/or utensils with <b>lead</b> <b>alloys.</b> Most bullet casters prefer to use portable electric melting pots in areas with good ventilation. Molten metal can cause serious burns; and molten metal can be sprayed around the working area by violently expanding steam if it comes in contact with water from spilled drinks or other sources. Bullet casters should wear protective clothing including eye protection, and should carefully wash hands prior to eating, drinking, or smoking. Young children are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning and are unlikely to appreciate the danger of shiny molten metal and newly cast bullets. Bullet casting must be limited to times and locations when children are absent.Particular risk comes from the oxides of lead and other metals present in <b>lead</b> <b>alloys,</b> as oxides are often more easily absorbed than the metallic forms. This means that the dross that is skimmed from the lead pot may pose a larger hazard than the metallic alloys.|$|E
