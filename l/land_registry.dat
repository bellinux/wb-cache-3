5|$|For {{legal system}} reform, the Commission {{suggested}} {{the creation of}} county courts led by the Westminster judges with jurisdiction over civil actions, and small claims courts for amounts under £4 to be manned by commissioners, approved by Justices of the Peace. They also supported {{the creation of a}} Court of Appeal consisting of laymen chosen by Parliament, the formation of a <b>land</b> <b>registry</b> and a permanent law commission. Against Hale's wishes, the Commission called for the abolition of benefit of clergy, and the acquittal of those charged with justified homicide. The Commission also suggested that debtors should no longer be imprisoned, and attorneys should be educated at an Inn of Court and not allowed to practise until they were admitted as members.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to their normal duties, county court judges act as notary public and bailiffs (in particular, the fogedret sees to the enforcement of judgments and legal claims), as well as administrators of bankruptcy proceedings and probate matters. Furthermore, they administer the local <b>land</b> <b>registry.</b> In regard to the administrative tasks, these functions may be assigned to an assessor, which is a deputy judge. An electronic reform of the <b>land</b> <b>registry</b> system is being implemented, making the system entirely electronic.|$|E

He became the official surveyor of the province and conducted an expedition down the Salado River into Chaco. He also continued {{to work as a}} baker, and even thought of becoming a sugarcane planter. An account of his expedition, Excursion ou Rio Salado et dans le Chaco, was published in Paris in 1857.

25|$|Charles Louis made {{a number}} of {{administrative}} and financial reforms that were popular. Between 1824 and 1829, some measures were taken relating to duties; to a certain freedom of trade; tax cuts, at the <b>Land</b> <b>Registry.</b> He gave especial encouragement to education and medicine, favoring the establishment of schools. These reforms were implemented thanks to the initiative of his Minister Mansi during the duke's absence. Charles disappointed his subjects who had hoped for a return to the constitution of 1805 and the hopes of Liberals in his duchy shifted to his only son and heir. He tried to copy in Lucca things he saw made abroad regardless if the conditions in the duchy were favorable. His love for traveling created many difficulties in governing and he often signed decrees according to his state of mind at the moment without any real knowledge of the issues. The actual power rested in his minister Mansi. It was said that while Charles Louis was the Duke, Mansi was king. Aware that Lucca was headed to be annexed by Tuscany, Mansi aligned his policies with those of Florence, which was resented by Charles Louis. However his weakness and his restless character did not allow Charles to escape the oppressive relations of protection and control exerted upon Lucca by the courts of Austria, Tuscany and Modena. He was viewed with suspicion by both Louis Philippe of France and Metternich.|$|E

500|$|Although house {{prices have}} {{traditionally}} been lower {{than the national average}} in Navenby, they have risen quickly in recent years. In 2004, the average house price rose by 8.2% to £163,186, according to the <b>Land</b> <b>Registry,</b> while in 1999 the average was £60,000. The district surrounding Navenby – North Kesteven – remains a relatively inexpensive place to purchase property. Consequently, owner occupation is 77% – which is higher than both the regional and national averages. However, the rising prices of recent years are resulting in housing becoming increasingly [...] "out of reach for those on average incomes". A 2004 Housing Needs Study, carried out by Fordham Associates for North Kesteven District Council, highlighted the need for 460"affordable homes" [...] to be built each year {{for the next five years}} in Navenby and the surrounding villages.|$|E
50|$|The name of {{the village}} is also {{recorded}} as Lackh Püchel and Logbichl in old <b>land</b> <b>registries,</b> and was known as Autlogpichl, Lockpiechl, or Logpichl in the Gottschee German dialect. The designation Staro-/Alt- 'old' distinguished the settlement from the nearby younger settlement of Novološki Grič (Neu-Lagbüchel). Both the Slovene name and German names literally mean '(old) hill near a marshy meadow'. Slovene place names containing the word grič 'small hill' are relatively common and may historically refer to elevations rising over 100 meters.|$|R

500|$|On 11 June 1986, {{the laws}} {{concerning}} [...] "abandoned" [...] properties during the Armenian Genocide were abrogated, which ended 73 years of effectiveness. Throughout the Republican period, the laws continued {{to provide a}} legal basis for the confiscation of additional property {{that belonged to the}} deportees. Though the laws were abolished in 1986, the General Directorate of <b>Land</b> <b>Registry</b> and Cadastre (Turkish: Tapu ve Kadastro Genel Müdürlüğü) issued an order on 29 June 2001 which effectively transferred all the leftover [...] "abandoned" [...] properties to the government. The order also forbid the disclosure of any information regarding the title or the documentation of the properties. As a result, the owners or their heirs could not make claims to the property since it was now securely sanctioned under Turkish law and had become property of the state.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there was}} general {{agreement}} that property {{law should be}} reformed the process was made more difficult by the various vested interests involved; the Law Society, for example, was opposed to the changes because it would reduce the fees dedicated property solicitors could earn by {{making it possible for}} more solicitors to understand that area of law and become involved. After intense negotiation Schuster and the Law Society representative agreed that a [...] "period of probation" [...] lasting three years would be included in the bill, which Charles Brickdale the Chief Registrar of HM <b>Land</b> <b>Registry</b> considered [...] "a very good bargain". When the bill finally got to the House of Commons it met additional opposition from Members of Parliament who were also members of the Law Society and Bar Council, as well as Lord Cave who later became Lord Chancellor. After further negotiations the bill was passed on 8 June 1922, with Birkenhead taking the credit, and it became the Law of Property Act 1922.|$|E
