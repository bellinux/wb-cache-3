III, a transponder system that <b>listened</b> <b>for</b> pulses between 160MHz and 190MHz and responded with longer pulses on a slightly different frequency. Since the magnetron operated at 3.3GHz, it would not trigger the IFF system, so a second pulsed transmitter system had {{to be used in}} the fighters to support this, the interrogator (or interrogator/responder), code named Lucero.|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} eight months of World War II, Dumbo {{operations}} complemented simultaneous United States Army Air Forces heavy bombing operations against Japanese targets. On any one large-scale bombing mission carried out by Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, at least three submarines were posted along the air route, and Dumbo aircraft sent to patrol the distant waters where they searched the water's surface and <b>listened</b> <b>for</b> emergency radio transmissions from distressed aircraft. At the final bombing mission on August 14, 1945, 9 land-based Dumbos and 21 flying boats covered a surface and sub-surface force of 14 submarines and 5 rescue ships.|$|E

25|$|Very large {{radio telescopes}} on Earth were also {{listening}} to Huygens 10-watt transmission using {{the technique of}} very long baseline interferometry and aperture synthesis mode. At 11:25 CET on January 14, the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia detected the carrier signal from Huygens. The GBT continued to detect the carrier signal well after Cassini stopped listening to the incoming data stream. In addition to the GBT, eight of the ten telescopes of the continent-wide VLBA in North America, located at Pie Town and Los Alamos, New Mexico; Fort Davis, Texas; North Liberty, Iowa; Kitt Peak, Arizona; Brewster, Washington; Owens Valley, California; and Mauna Kea, Hawaii, also <b>listened</b> <b>for</b> the Huygens signal.|$|E
25|$|The {{transponder}} {{problem had}} been growing before the introduction of AIS. IFF worked {{on the basis of}} a small receiver/transmitter set that <b>listened</b> <b>for</b> pulses from a radar and produced a low-power pulse broadcast on the same frequency but slightly delayed. The signal returned to the radar-equipped aircraft along with the original radar signal. When the two were amplified and displayed, the IFF signal caused the blip seen on the radar screen to stretch out. The original 1.5m radar system had by this time been adapted to a wide range of roles including AI, ASV and acting as the basis for both the CHL and the new AMES Type 7 ground control interception radars. To avoid interference problems, each of these operated on slightly different frequencies, from about 180 to 210MHz. The Navy and Army added their own variations. The IFF Mk. II, originally designed to respond to the Mk. IV, had to be repeatedly modified to respond to new radar frequencies, and none of the many models were able to respond to all of these.|$|E

500|$|In 1995, David Toop {{published}} his second book, Ocean of Sound: Aether Talk, Ambient Sound and Imaginary Worlds, which examined {{music as a}} medium for deep mental involvement. In the book, Toop said that ambient music {{can be defined as}} music <b>listened</b> <b>for</b> relaxation or music that [...] "taps into the disturbing, chaotic undertow of the environment". As an aural companion to the book, Toop curated the compilation album Ocean of Sound, which would also serve as a historical survey of ambient music. The album was released in January 1996 by Virgin Records. It later went out of print, which music journalist Michaelangelos Matos said was because such cross-licensed compilation albums [...] "seldom stay available for very long".|$|E
500|$|On March 24, {{the jurors}} <b>listened</b> <b>for</b> 45minutes to a rereading of {{testimony}} of the State Police chemist regarding the blood found at the scene, on the LeMans, and Shakur's clothing. That night, the second night of jury deliberation, the jury asked Judge Appleby to repeat his instructions regarding the four assault charges 30minutes before retiring for the night, which led to speculation that the jury had decided in Shakur's favor on the remaining charges, especially the two counts of murder. Appleby reiterated that the jury must consider separately the four assault charges (atrocious assault and battery, assault on a police officer acting {{in the line of}} duty, assault with a deadly weapon, and assault with intent to kill), each of which carried a total maximum penalty of 33years in prison. The other charges were: first-degree murder (of Foerster), second-degree murder (of Zayd Shakur), illegal possession of a weapon, and armed robbery (related to Foerster's service revolver). The jury also asked Appleby to repeat the definitions of [...] "intent" [...] and [...] "reasonable doubt".|$|E
500|$|Winnipeg and Hamilton {{met again}} in 1962, the 50th Grey Cup, immortalized as the [...] "Fog Bowl". [...] The game {{was held at}} Toronto's Exhibition Stadium, and began on Saturday, December 1, 1962. [...] The fog rolled in {{early in the second}} quarter and became {{increasingly}} dense as the game progressed. By the fourth quarter, the players were unable to see the sideline markers and the fans unable to see the play. [...] The players were unable to see the ball in the air – kick returners <b>listened</b> <b>for</b> the sound of the ball hitting the ground – and the action was largely invisible to the television audience. [...] With nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds remaining in the game and Winnipeg holding onto a 28–27 lead, officials made the unprecedented decision to suspend play until the next day. Though the league feared that continuing fog on the morning of December 2 would force the complete abandonment of the game, it lifted in time for the contest to resume. [...] Around 15,000 of the original 32,655 spectators watched Winnipeg win the Grey Cup without further scoring by either team. It was the first title game completed on a Sunday; the Grey Cup moved from its traditional Saturday start to Sunday in 1969.|$|E

500|$|Throughout January 1944, AirSols {{aircraft}} {{based in}} the Solomon Islands and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircraft based on Kiriwina kept up a sustained air offensive against Rabaul. Under steady and relentless pressure, the Japanese air defence began to weaken, allowing a landing {{to be made on}} 15 February by New Zealand troops on the Green Islands, which lie little more than [...] from Rabaul. On 16 and 17 February, the US Pacific Fleet's Task Force 58 attacked the main Japanese base at Truk. Most Japanese aircraft were recalled to defend Truk and 19 February saw the last significant interception of Allied aircraft over Rabaul. Meanwhile, on 13 February, General MacArthur had issued orders for the invasion of the Admiralty Islands, codenamed Operation Brewer, which was now scheduled for 1 April. Forces assigned included the 1st Cavalry Division; No.73 Wing RAAF, providing close air support; the 592nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR); the US Marines' 1st Amphibious Tractor Battalion; and US Naval Construction Battalions ("Seabees") to build the naval base—a total of 45,000personnel. However, on 23 February 1944 three Fifth Air Force B-25 Mitchell bombers flew low over Los Negros. The airmen reported that there were no signs of enemy activity and the islands had been evacuated. Lieutenant General George Kenney, the commander of Allied Air Forces in the South West Pacific Area, went to MacArthur and proposed that the unoccupied islands be quickly taken by a small force. According to Kenney: [...] "The General <b>listened</b> <b>for</b> a while, paced back and forth as I kept talking, nodded occasionally, then suddenly stopped and said: That will put the cork in the bottle." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), at the {{beginning}} of the second year following the Exodus from Egypt, God told Moses to have the Israelites celebrate Passover at its set time. But some men were unclean because they had had contact with a corpse and could not offer the Passover sacrifice on the set day. They asked Moses and Aaron how they could participate in Passover, and Moses told them to stand by while he <b>listened</b> <b>for</b> God's instructions. God told Moses that whenever Israelites were defiled by a corpse or on a long journey on Passover, they were to offer the Passover offering on the 14th day of the second month—a month after Passover—otherwise in strict accord with the law of the Passover sacrifice. But if a man who was clean and not on a journey refrained from offering the Passover sacrifice, he was to be cut off from his kin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{major issue}} {{contemporary}} critics had with Leskov's prose {{was what they}} perceived to be an [...] "overabundance of colours"; the grotesque expressiveness of the language he used.

In a December 3, 1890, letter, writing {{of the short story}} [...] "The Hour of God's Will", he remarked: [...] "This fairytale is excellent, {{but it would have been}} much better if not for this overabundance of talent." [...] Leskov was unrepentant. [...] "To write in a simple manner as Lev Nikolayevich does, is beyond me. Such a gift is not mine... take me as I am, for I've gotten used to polishing my stuff and simply cannot work in any other way," [...] he wrote to Chertkov in one of his 1888 letters. [...] "My clergymen talk like clergymen do, and my muzhiks talk like muzhiks talk in real life... this folkish, vulgar and intricate language is not of my invention, I've <b>listened</b> <b>for</b> years to Russian people talking... and I can say that in my books they talk like they do in real life, not in literary fashion," [...] he insisted later, speaking to biographer Anatoly Faresov.|$|E
