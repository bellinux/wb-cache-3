40|$|A bus based {{parallel}} architectures is practical {{only for}} {{a small number of}} processors. For several thousand processors the bus would need to have a width of tens of thousands, or possibly a few hundred thousand wires (bits). Similarly, {{it is not possible to}} provide complete interconnectivity for highly parallel systems. For N = 10, 000, 100, 000, 000 channels would be required. Not only is the total number of channels unrealistic, but so is also the number of channels per node. One of the major constraints in system design is the packaging. The number of connections between a chip and a printed circuit (PC) board, or between a PC board and a backplane, or between backplanes, are limited by ensuring a sufficient mechanical strength of the connectors, enforcing a minimum width of each connector. Pin <b>Grid</b> <b>Arrays</b> (PGA) offer 200 – 400 pins per chip package, while current state-of-the art so-called <b>Land</b> <b>Grid</b> <b>Arrays</b> (LGA) offers up to 2, 000 connectors with spacings at about 1 mm, requiring an area of close to 2, 500 mm 2. Board connectors may offer about 2 – 3 pins per mm, or about 1, 000 for a standard PC board. Thus, all highly parallel systems use some form of sparse network to interconnect the processors and memory modules. Locality of reference is important for performance at all levels in most systems.

50|$|LGA {{packaging}} {{is related}} to ball grid array (BGA) and pin grid array (PGA) packaging. Unlike pin grid arrays, <b>land</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> packages are designed to fit either in a socket, or be soldered down using surface mount technology. PGA packages cannot be soldered down using surface mount technology. In contrast with a BGA, <b>land</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> packages in non socketed configurations have no balls, and use flat contacts which are soldered directly to the PCB. BGA packages, however have balls as their contacts in between the IC and the PCBs. The balls are normally attached to {{the underside of the}} IC.|$|E
