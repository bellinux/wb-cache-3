25|$|Although the poses plastiques {{were never}} {{considered}} a serious form of art, Nicholson's version {{has been described}} as the most <b>low</b> <b>brow</b> form that it took. A writer visiting from France published a critical account of the show, characterising it as a pretentious form of entertainment. It was also criticised by English social reformers, who characterized the acts as a form of prostitution. After Nicholson moved his events to the Coal Hole tavern, the management officially stopped allowing women into the audience in order to fight this perception. However, some women were still able to gain entry to the events.|$|E
2500|$|Taking a {{photograph}} {{in a court}} {{can be seen as}} a serious offence, leading to a prison sentence. The prohibition on taking photographs in the precincts is vague. It was designed to prevent the undermining of the dignity of the court, through the exploitation of images in <b>low</b> <b>brow</b> [...] "picture papers".|$|E
2500|$|Sheckels {{contends that}} [...] "what [...] terms the ‘carnivalesque’ {{is tied to}} the body and the public {{exhibition}} of its more private functions [...] it served also as a communication event [...] anti-authority communication events [...] can also be deemed ‘carnivalesque’.” [...] Essentially, the act of turning society around through communication, whether it be in the form of text, protest, or otherwise serves as a communicative form of carnival, according to Bakhtin. Steele furthers the idea of carnivalesque in communication as she argues that it is found in corporate communication. Steele states “that ritualized sales meetings, annual employee picnics, retirement roasts and similar corporate events fit the category of carnival.” Carnival cannot help but be linked to communication and culture as Steele points out that “in addition to qualities of inversion, ambivalence, and excess, carnival’s themes typically include a fascination with the body, particularly its little-glorified or 'lower strata' parts, and dichotomies between ‘high’ or ‘low’.”. The high and low binary is particularly relevant in communication as certain verbiage is considered high, while slang is considered low. Moreover, much of popular communication including television shows, books, and movies fall into high and <b>low</b> <b>brow</b> categories. This is particularly prevalent in Bakhtin’s native Russia, where postmodernist writers such as Boris Akunin have worked to change <b>low</b> <b>brow</b> communication forms (such as the mystery novel) into higher literary works of art by making constant references to one of Bakhtin’s favorite subjects, Dostoyevsky.|$|E

60|$|Her supple maiden {{body was}} {{sheathed}} in a gown of cloth of silver; her {{brown hair was}} dressed into two plaits interlaced with gold threads and set with tiny gems, and these plaits hung one on either breast.

60|$|Having assured {{himself that}} Peppe had no weapons, {{and that his}} arms were pinioned behind him, Gian Maria bade the two guards withdraw, but hold {{themselves}} in readiness in the ante-chamber with Armstadt. Then he turned to Peppe with a scowl on his <b>low</b> <b>brow.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned it}} very soon—she {{apparently}} had been {{speaking to the}} ouvreuse, {{at the door of}} the box—and presented her face to the public; a fair harmonious face, with smiling eyes, smiling lips, a <b>low</b> <b>brow</b> ornamented with delicate rings of black hair and ears marked by the sparkle of diamonds sufficiently large to be seen across the Théâtre Français. Littlemore looked at her, then started and held out his hand. “The glass, please!” ...|$|E
60|$|As far as person went, she {{answered}} point for point, both to my picture and Mrs. Fairfax's description. The noble bust, the sloping shoulders, the graceful neck, the {{dark eyes and}} black ringlets were all there;--but her face? Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed likeness: the same <b>low</b> <b>brow,</b> the same high features, the same pride. It was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her laugh was satirical, {{and so was the}} habitual expression of her arched and haughty lip.|$|E
60|$|Yes, {{he would}} suit her purpose admirably!

40|$|The {{forehead}} lift (elevation of {{the forehead}} andbrow) is becoming {{recognized as an}} essential ele-ment in the rejuvenation of the aging face. According to statistics compiled by the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, 1 between 1997 and 2002 the number of forehead lifts increased by 19 %, from 55, 009 in 1997 to 65, 284 in 2002. The reasons for this increased interest in brow lifting are multiple. Cosmetic surgeons are increasingly {{aware of the need}} to evaluate all facial features as a unit rather than considering only the cheek, neck, and eyelids. The proper positioning of the forehead and brow is an essen-tial component in the overall synergy of the face. Furthermore, the limited goal of elevation of <b>low</b> <b>brows</b> has been supplanted by the need to improve forehead rhytids and muscle imbalance, as well as to correct upper-eyelid aesthetics and lateral temporal laxity. 2,...|$|R
60|$|The man {{who came}} up the {{staircase}} with a furtive, soft-footed tread was quite unknown to Tommy. He was obviously of the very dregs of society. The <b>low</b> beetling <b>brows,</b> and the criminal jaw, the bestiality of the whole countenance were new to the young man, {{though he was a}} type that Scotland Yard would have recognized at a glance.|$|R
60|$|He {{raised his}} eyes from the menu and looked stealthily round. Helen Bellew was talking to his father, her white {{shoulder}} turned a little away. George was proud of his composure, but there was a strange longing in his face. She gave, indeed, just excuse for people to consider her too good-looking for the position in which she was placed. Her figure was tall and supple and full, and now that she no longer hunted was getting fuller. Her hair, looped back in loose bands across a broad <b>low</b> <b>brow,</b> had a peculiar soft lustre.|$|E
60|$|Standing in the crepuscular {{light of}} the corner, her marvellous beauty shone out with the vivid {{richness}} of some rare painting. She was tall, and the magnificent proportions of her figure were enhanced rather than marred by the severely plain dress of dark print that she wore. The heavy masses of her hair, a shining auburn dashed with golden foam, were coiled in a rich, glossy knot {{at the back of}} the classically modelled head and rippled back from a <b>low</b> <b>brow</b> whose waxen fairness even the breezes of the ocean had spared.|$|E
60|$|As Isaac {{entered the}} room a slender maiden ran impulsively to him and {{throwing}} her arms round his neck hid her face on his breast. A few broken, incoherent words escaped her lips. Isaac disengaged himself from the clinging arms and put her from him. The face raised to his was strikingly beautiful. Oval in shape, it was as white as his own, with a broad, <b>low</b> <b>brow</b> and regular features. The eyes were large and dark and they dilated and quickened with a thousand shadows of thought.|$|E
60|$|Sir Percy's {{head was}} well thrown back, and the pale {{rays of the}} moon caught {{the edge of the}} {{clear-cut}} profile, the <b>low</b> massive <b>brow,</b> the drooping lids through which the audacious plotter was lazily regarding the man who held not only his own life, but that of the woman who was infinitely dear to him, in the hollow of his hand.|$|R
60|$|Ah me! {{how soon}} a man's place knoweth him no more! What fresh {{recollections}} that majestic form awoke in me--the massive features, with the steadfast eye, and <b>low,</b> square <b>brow,</b> curled over with short rings of hair; the mouth, that, through the thick, short beard, still invited trust and reliance, even {{while there was}} a look of fire and determination that inspired dread.|$|R
60|$|Isaac {{reclined}} on {{the couch}} with his head and shoulder propped up by pillows. He was the handsomest of the brothers. His face would have been but for the marks of privation, singularly like Betty's; the same <b>low,</b> level <b>brows</b> and dark eyes; the same mouth, though the lips were stronger and without the soft curves which made his sister's mouth so sweet.|$|R
60|$|There was our tall friend Joe Davidson, the mate; and Ned Spivin, {{a man of}} {{enormous}} chest and shoulders, though short in the legs; and Luke Trevor, a handsome young fellow of middle size, but great strength and activity, and John Gunter, a big sour-faced man with a <b>low</b> <b>brow,</b> rough black hair, and a surly spirit. Billy {{was supposed to be}} minding the tiller, but, in the circumstances, the tiller was left to mind itself. Zulu was the only active member on board, to judge from the clatter of his pots and pans below.|$|E
60|$|This evening {{her dress}} was a simple, but a marvellously poised thing {{of black and}} silver: {{in the words of}} the correct journal. With her tight, black, bright hair, her arched brows, her dusky-ruddy face and her bare shoulders; her strange equanimity, her long, slow, {{slanting}} looks; she looked foreign and frightening, clear as a cameo, but dark, far off. Julia was the English beauty, in a lovely blue dress. Her hair was becomingly untidy on her <b>low</b> <b>brow,</b> her dark blue eyes wandered and got excited, her nervous mouth twitched. Her high-pitched, sing-song voice and her hurried laugh could be heard in the theatre. She twisted a beautiful little fan that a dead artist had given her.|$|E
60|$|She had {{the small}} regular features, the blue eyes, and the broad <b>low</b> <b>brow,</b> which the Victorian painters, Lord Leighton, Alma Tadema, {{and a hundred}} others, induced the world they lived in to accept {{as a type of}} Greek beauty. She seemed to {{have a great deal of}} hair: it was {{arranged}} with peculiar elaboration and done over the forehead in what she called an Alexandra fringe. She was very anaemic. Her thin lips were pale, and her skin was delicate, of a faint green colour, without a touch of red even in the cheeks. She had very good teeth. She took great pains to prevent her work from spoiling her hands, and they were small, thin, and white. She went about her duties with a bored look.|$|E

5000|$|Describing the {{dichotomy}} of the series, Rilke wrote in 1898 of Degas' pictures of [...] "ballerinas full of sequined rubbish and stage lighting.

I’m glad my album came out right now and not when his album is about to come out. It’s dope though. It’s like sometimes I want to pinch myself. It’s one of those moments man. It’s like if I were to work with Michael Jackson and shit. I’m happy I get to do business with people, I know people can’t listen to my album in one day and have 700+ replies to me saying, “This is the most incredible album of the year, 10/10.” I get more people excited that one of the highest brow artists and one of the <b>lowest</b> <b>brow</b> artists meet up. People are excited about that, that’s dope for me-that Kanye would work with a kid like me, that’s a great message." ...|$|R
6000|$|Swithin {{bowed to}} {{a man with a}} small forehead, who had {{appeared}} softly, and stood with his gloved hands touching his waist. Swithin conceived a sudden aversion for this catlike man. About Boleskey there was that which made contempt impossible--the sense of comradeship begotten in the fight; the man's height; something lofty and savage in his face; and an obscure instinct that it would not pay to show distaste; but this Kasteliz, with his neat jaw, <b>low</b> <b>brow,</b> and velvety, volcanic look, excited his proper English animosity. [...] "Your friends are mine," [...] murmured Kasteliz. He spoke with suavity, and hissed his s's. A long, vibrating twang quavered through the room. Swithin turned and saw Rozsi sitting at the czymbal; the notes rang under the little hammers in her hands, incessant, metallic, rising and falling with that strange melody. Kasteliz had fixed his glowing eyes on her; Boleskey, nodding his head, was staring at the floor; Margit, with a pale face, stood like a statue.|$|E
60|$|When {{he started}} that {{morning for the}} Temple, he had still a feeling of {{extraordinary}} lightness in his limbs, and he still saw that face--its perfect regularity, its warm pallor, and dark smiling eyes rather wide apart, its fine, small, close-set ears, and the sweep of the black-brown hair across the <b>low</b> <b>brow.</b> Or was it something much less definite he saw--an emanation or expression, a trick, a turn, an indwelling grace, a something that appealed, that turned, and touched him? Whatever it was, it would not let him be, {{and he did not}} desire that it should. For this was in his character; if he saw a horse that he liked, he put his money on whatever it ran; if charmed by an opera, he went over and over again; if by a poem, he almost learned it by heart. And while he walked along the river--his usual route--he had queer and unaccustomed sensations, now melting, now pugnacious. And he felt happy.|$|E
6000|$|As to Captain Lydgate himself, his <b>low</b> <b>brow,</b> his {{aquiline nose}} bent on one side, and his rather heavy utterance, {{might have been}} disadvantageous in any young gentleman who had not a {{military}} bearing and mustache to give him what is doted on by some flower-like blond heads as [...] "style." [...] He had, moreover, that sort of high-breeding which consists in being free from the petty solicitudes of middle-class gentility, {{and he was a}} great critic of feminine charms. Rosamond delighted in his admiration now even more than she had done at Quallingham, and he found it easy to spend several hours of the day in flirting with her. The visit altogether was one of the pleasantest larks he had ever had, not the less so perhaps because he suspected that his queer cousin Tertius wished him away: though Lydgate, who would rather (hyperbolically speaking) have died than have failed in polite hospitality, suppressed his dislike, and only pretended generally not to hear what the gallant officer said, consigning the task of answering him to Rosamond. For he was not at all a jealous husband, and preferred leaving a feather-headed young gentleman alone with his wife to bearing him company.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more they}} {{settled down to}} patient waiting. The smell of frying bacon mingled with that of wood-smoke and tantalized their nostrils. It seemed an age before the door creaked again. Hal only of the three boys could see the dark face that peered out in the {{direction}} of the spring. It was the darker for an ugly scowl which contracted the <b>low</b> <b>brows.</b> For a long minute the man stared {{in the direction of}} the spring and Hal could see his lips moving as if he muttered to himself. Then he vanished inside and the door closed. It was not long, however, before it opened again and once more the scowling face appeared, staring toward the spring. It was clear that his companion's continued absence was beginning to puzzle him. Taking a step forward he imitated to perfection the hoarse croak of a raven. So true to life was it that Hal instinctively looked up expecting to see the black bird of ill omen. Then it flashed over him that this was a signal call to the man who had gone for the water.|$|R

60|$|He {{was sitting}} in the car dreamily smoking, his hat drawn <b>low</b> over his <b>brows,</b> when an {{acquaintance}} passing through the car stopped with a word of greeting.
