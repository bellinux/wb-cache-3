40|$|Every day, in courtrooms {{across the}} United States, law {{enforcement}} officers testify in criminal and civil trials. Often an officer is certified as an expert witness and, accordingly, can provide opinions to the court based {{on his or her}} law enforcement expertise. Other times, the officer offers testimony as a layperson. In the latter situation, Federal Rule of Evidence 701 controls the officer’s <b>lay</b> <b>opinion</b> testimony. This Rule was first adopted to remedy a problematic common law practice of universally prohibiting <b>lay</b> <b>opinion</b> testimony.

40|$|Determining whether experience-based opinion {{should be}} {{evaluated}} as lay or as expert opinion has proven particularly challenging to the courts. The Federal Rules of Evidence were amended in 2000, adopting specific, more stringent requirements for expert testimony and hardening the line between lay and expert opinion. Expert opinion testimony is admissible only if based on reliable methodology, whereas <b>lay</b> <b>opinion</b> must be rationally derived using everyday reasoning. The decisions applying the rules do not strike the right balance in regard to experience-based opinion. Too often, courts either accept claims of experience-based expertise at face value or admit experience-based opinion as <b>lay</b> <b>opinion</b> without rigorously applying the governing rule. As a result, they admit unreliable and unwarranted opinion testimony. This Article explains why more experience-based opinion {{should be evaluated}} as <b>lay</b> <b>opinion</b> and also argues for increased scrutiny of such <b>lay</b> <b>opinion.</b> Only a witness who has a reliable and specialized mode of analysis and has applied it to a reliable basis should be granted the latitude accorded an expert. A witness who merely applies everyday reasoning to draw inferences based on experience and observations should be constrained by the rules that govern <b>lay</b> <b>opinion.</b> This Article suggests five guidelines for the admissibility of experience-based opinion: 1) the court should generally determine the admissibility of the opinion under the rules governing lay opinion; 2) the court should be skeptical of claims that the witness possesses expertise based on experience and 2 ̆ 2 training, 2 ̆ 2 understanding {{that the combination of}} experience and training does not necessarily signal that the witness brings reliable methodology to bear on the facts; 3) to determine the admissibility of experience-based opinion, the court should scrutinize the fit between the witness 2 ̆ 7 experience and the proffered opinion; 4) the court should strictly limit opinion testimony that draws inferences based on third party conduct; and 5) the court should preclude witnesses from over-generalizing based on their experience...|$|E

Medical use of cannabis declined in the early 20 th century with the ad-vent of analgesics that could be delivered in better stan-dardized doses than oral cannabis preparations [3]. This decline was accelerated by the signing of international drug control treaties in the 20 th century that classed cannabis as a drug with no medical use. There was renewed interest in the medical use of cannabis in the 1970 s in the United States. This occurred {{in the midst of}} rising recreational cannabis use among young people, ensuring that the debate about the medical use of cannabis would become entangled in the debate about whether its recreational use should be permitted [4].

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 s, many risk {{communication}} studies {{have discussed the}} importance of democratic procedure. Such studies have emphasized the introduction of <b>lay</b> <b>opinions</b> and viewpoints into the policy process rather than technocratic policy making, two-way (interactive) communication rather than one-way one, and mutual understanding or consensus rather than persuading the public to accept the experts' judgments. In short, risk communication studies have required more and more citizen engagement in the policy making process. But despite the emphasis on "democracy", many of these risk communication studies have overlooked the importance of democratic procedure itself, whereas they seem to focus on achieving desirable outcomes by using it in risk communication practice. If democratic risk communication deserves the name of "democracy", how democratic is risk communication? For this reason, this paper aims to find a clue to evaluating risk communication {{from the standpoint of}} political philosophy. So, to explain the democratic feature of risk communication, I attempt to compare it with public participation from the perspective of deliberative democracy, which is an emerging concept in political theory and political philosophy. In the second section, I outline the risk communication studies which focused on democracy from the late 1980 s to the early 1990 s, and the grounds for regarding the democratic model as democratic. In the third section,I discuss the reasons for requiring public participation in risk-related decision making. In the fourth section, I examine the differences between risk communication and public participation. And the final section pursues the possibility of evaluating risk communication from the perspective of deliberative democracy. Whereas this approach is overly speculative, it will provide the meanings of the term "democracy" in risk communication study...|$|R
40|$|Ethical {{dilemmas}} in biomedical research, {{especially in}} vulnerable populations, often spark heated debate. Despite recommendations and guidelines, many issues remain controversial, including the relevance, prioritisation {{and application of}} individual voluntary informed consent in non-Western settings. The voices of the people {{likely to be the}} subjects of research have been notably absent from the debate. We held discussions with groups of community members living in the rural study area of a large research unit in Kenya. Discussions were facilitated by three research study vignettes outlining one field-based and two hospital-based studies being planned or taking place at the time. In addition to gathering general views about the aims and activities of the research unit, questions focused on whether consent should be sought for studies, and if so from whom (chiefs, elders, men/women, children), and on ascertaining whether there are any special concerns about the physical act of signing consent forms. The findings revealed the community's difficulty in distinguishing research from clinical investigations conducted in clinical settings. There was a spectrum of views regarding perceived appropriateness of consent procedures, in part because of difficulty in disentangling clinical from research aims, and because of other challenges to applying consent in practice. Debates between community members highlight the inadequacy of simplistic assumptions about community members' views on informed consent, and the complexity of incorporating <b>lay</b> <b>opinions</b> into biomedical research. Failure to appreciate these issues risks exaggerating differences between settings, and underestimating the time and resources required to ensure meaningful community involvement in research processes. Ultimately, it risks inadequately responding to the needs and values of those on whom the success of most biomedical research depends.

40|$|The {{narrative}} lay in French (not to {{be confused}} with the Occitanian lyric lay which resembled the descort) flourished in Northern France and Britain in the years c. 1150 - 1250. This thesis discusses its peculiar characteristics, form, content, chronology and audience, which are often disputed, as a necessary prelude to an examination of the treatment of love and marriage contained in them. This is preceded by a study of contemporary attitudes to marriage among the nobility, taking ecclesiastical and <b>lay</b> <b>opinions</b> into account, and likewise a study is made of attitudes towards love, concentrating on influential contemporary French and Latin treatises on the subject. In the lays marriage and love are prominent factors, often included even when plainly extraneous to the authors' source material. Some authors devote their whole attention to them, and the narrative content is but slight. Most lays avoid these extremes. Marriage is perceived as an event over which individuals (particularly women) have little control, since it was generally assumed that marriage was an important means of achieving stability, and so many people had a legitimate interest in arranging them for reasons other than emotional satisfaction. Consequently, marriages were frequently unavoidable, unwelcome and unhappy. At the same time, love was highly regarded by the nobility as an essential personal experience, eagerly sought and accepted despite the dangers it might have posed as a threat to social order if it was extra-marital; agents of that order defended their interests vigorously. The lays presented no easily available alternative to marriage (death or the Otherworld being the only possibilities), but found love and marriage compatible, provided individuals were consulted, and in this they display commonsense humanity compared with the legalism of Church and feudal society and are refreshingly free of the over-complexities of theories of love. <p...|$|R
40|$|Fifty years ago, U. S. {{courts and}} state legislatures began {{permitting}} aesthetic regu-lation, {{which refers to}} government efforts to enforce design quality in private develop-ment, based {{on the power of}} local governments to establish and enforce laws that pro-mote the public welfare. Yet legal thinkers and architects have charged that design re-view is plagued with several intrinsic problems, including preference for <b>lay</b> <b>opinion</b> rather than architectural expertise, lack of artistic freedom, unfairness, and arbitrary definitions of good design (Scheer, 1994). Moreover, recent Supreme Court rulings have placed strict requirements on local governments to justify the public purpose and extent of their land-use regulations, including design review. In Psychology and the Aesthetics of the Built Environment, Arthur E.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{sometimes}} elusive line between expert and <b>lay</b> <b>opinion</b> testimony. Justice Holmes once remarked {{that the law is}} constantly drawing lines. That remark certainly holds true in Evidence law. On a daily basis trial judges must distinguish between character and noncharacter uses of evidence and differentiate hearsay from nonhearsay theories of logical relevance. The topic of this article is another evidentiary distinction: that between lay opinions and expert opinions. That distinction has assumed tremendous importance since 1993. In that year, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 was amended to prescribe mandatory pre-discovery disclosures. One of the most important parts of that scheme is a mandate that the proponent of a testifying expert provide the opposition with a detailed report previewing the expert’s opinion. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 imposes a similar requirement for an expert report. However, there is no requirement under either rule for such a report when the opinion is lay in nature. In the same year, the Supreme Court handed down its celebrated decision in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U. S. 579 (1993). Daubert announced a new empirical validation test for the admissibility of scientific testimony. In 1999 in Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U. S. 137 (1999), the Court expanded Daubert and held that the proponent of any type of expert testimony must establish objective indicia of the reliability of the testimony. Like the Civil Rule 26 and Criminal Rule 16 amendments, Daubert and Kumho are inapplicable to <b>lay</b> <b>opinion</b> testimony. These two 1993 developments have created a strong incentive for litigants to characterize their witnesses’ opinions as lay rather than expert. If the judge accepts that characterization, {{there is no need for}} the litigant to file a Rule 26 report or lay a Daubert foundation. Unfortunately, as Part I of the enclosed article points out, the courts are experiencing difficulty drawing the line between lay and expert opinions. Part I considers several possible bases for distinguishing the two types of opinions that have been proposed in the past. Part I demonstrates that each of those potential bases is unsatisfactory. Part II argues that in order to properly differentiate between the two types of opinions, the court should focus on the underlying reasoning processes. In the case of both types of opinions, the witness arrives at the opinion by evaluating a case-specific fact in light of a generalization. However, the two types of opinions differ in both: (1) how the witness obtains the case-specific information; and (2) how they validate and derive the generalization. Part III of the article explains how the courts may use the insights discussed in Part II to both differentiate between the two types of opinion and determine the admissibility of such opinions. Although the courts have struggled to draw the line in these cases, Part III demonstrates that the courts can draw the line with confidence by employing the analysis proposed in Part II...|$|E

40|$|Background: There is {{a dearth}} of {{normative}} data on linguistic development among child speakers of Southern African languages, {{especially in the case}} of the multilingual children who constitute the largest part of this population. This inevitably impacts on the accuracy of developmental assessments of such speakers. Already negative <b>lay</b> <b>opinion</b> on the effect of early multilingualism on language development rates could be exacerbated by the lack of developmental data, ultimately affecting choices regarding home and school language policies. Objectives: To establish whether trilinguals necessarily exhibit developmental delay when compared to monolinguals and, if so, whether this delay (1) occurs in terms of both lexical and grammatical development; and (2) in all three the trilinguals’ languages, regardless of input quantity. Method: Focusing on isiXhosa, South African English and Afrikaans, the study involved a comparison of 11 four-year-old developing trilinguals’ acquisition of vocabulary and passive constructions with that of 10 age-matched monolingual speakers of each language. Results: The trilinguals proved to be monolingual-like in their lexical development in the language to which, on average, they had been exposed most over time, that is, isiXhosa. No developmental delay was found in the trilinguals’ acquisition of passive constructions, regardless of the language of testing. Conclusion: As previously found for bilingual development, necessarily reduced quantity of exposure does not hinder lexical development in the trilinguals’ input dominant language. The overall lack of delay in their acquisition of the passive is interpreted as possible evidence of cross-linguistic bootstrapping and support for early multilingual exposure. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background Cases of {{premature}} death in Africa {{may be attributed}} to witchcraft. In such settings, medical registration of causes of death is rare. To fill this gap, verbal autopsy (VA) methods record signs and symptoms of the deceased before death as well as <b>lay</b> <b>opinion</b> regarding the cause of death; this information is then interpreted to derive a medical cause of death. In the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance Site, South Africa, around 6 % of deaths are believed to be due to ‘bewitchment ’ by VA respondents. Methods Using 6874 deaths from the Agincourt Health and Socio-Demographic Surveillance System, the epidemiology of deaths reported as bewitchment was explored, and using medical causes of death derived from VA, the association between perceptions of witchcraft and biomedical causes of death was investigated. Results The odds of having one’s death reported as being due to bewitchment is significantly higher in children and reproductive-aged women (but not in men) than in older adults. Similarly, sudden deaths or those following an acute illness, deaths occurring before 2001 and those where traditional healthcare was sought {{are more likely to be}} reported as being due to bewitchment. Compared with all other deaths, deaths due to external causes are significantly less likely to be attributed to bewitchment, while maternal deaths are significantly more likely to be.

On the other side there was the whig defection, with the strange and unnatural addition from Birmingham. “Mr. Gladstone himself has no skill in these matters, and dare not <b>lay</b> an <b>opinion</b> before your Majesty on the probable general result.” He thought there was little chance, if any, of a tory majority in the new parliament. Opinion taken as a whole seemed to point to a majority not very large, whichever way it may be.|$|R
