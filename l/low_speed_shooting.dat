5|$|To {{eliminate}} this danger, if a USB hub detects {{a mix of}} {{high speed}} or full <b>speed</b> and <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices, it will by default disable communication to <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> device unless requested to switch to <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> mode. On reception of a PRE packet however, it will temporarily re-enable the output port to all <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices, to allow the host to send a single <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> packet to <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices. After the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> packet is sent, an end of packet (EOP) signal will tell the hub to disable all outputs to <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices again.|$|R

50|$|With <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> surface aerators SOTE (Standard Oxygen Transfer Efficiency) {{is higher}} thanks to better mixing {{capacity}}. This mixing capacity of an impeller depends highly on the impeller diameter. <b>Low</b> <b>speed</b> surface aerator present such high diameter. Therefore SOTE for <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> surface aerators is about 2 to 2.5 kg O2/kWh. This is why <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> surface aerators are mostly used in sewage or industrial treatment as WWTP are bigger and sparing energy (and money) becomes very interesting.|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that the SuperDARN radar needs ionospheric irregularities to receive echoes, which {{are considered to be}} generated mainly by gradient-drift instability (e.g., Keskinen and Ossakow 1983), growing in intensity if the electric field and plasma density are strong enough and properly oriented. In fact, there is a weak relationship between the SuperDARN echo power and Doppler velocity (Fukumoto et al. 1999; Fukumoto et al. 2000). We therefore examined whether the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> limit of SAPS is also the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> limit of SuperDARN observations by checking the echo power around the above limit. The result is that the echo power is mostly 3 to 25  dB, well above the noise level (0  dB) around the <b>lowest</b> <b>speed</b> limit of SAPS (250 to 300  m/s) (not shown in the figure). Therefore, we can say that the <b>lowest</b> <b>speed</b> limit of SAPS is not the <b>lowest</b> <b>speed</b> limit of SuperDARN observation.|$|R
