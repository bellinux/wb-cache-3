The optical dipole of a quantum dot lies in the plane and the spin is optically accessed via circularly polarized selection rules. Hence, a single waveguide, which can transport only one in-plane linear polarization component, cannot communicate the spin state between two points on a chip. To overcome this issue, we introduce a spin-photon interface based on two orthogonal waveguides, where the polarization emitted by a quantum dot is mapped to a path-encoded photon. We demonstrate operation by deducing the spin using the interference of in-plane photons.

The coefficient of reflection depends upon the dielectric properties of the material and the incidence angle of the wave to the reflecting object. The dielectric properties of water and dry soil differ by 80 times. Thus, there will be big difference of amplitude of reflected signal from water and dry soil. The reflected signal characteristics are also affected by the polarization of the signal and the antennas to receive the signals.
