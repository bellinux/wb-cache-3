However, caution is advised {{as the total}} amount of potassium in the body is not decreased, and it is possible for potassium <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> overshoot ("rebound hyperkalemia"); slow infusions of potassium chloride are therefore recommended while other treatment is commenced.|$|E

30|$|Whilst {{assigning}} {{a security}} <b>level</b> <b>to</b> a datum in a workflow is directly analogous <b>to</b> assigning a <b>level</b> <b>to</b> an object (e.g. a document) {{in the standard}} Bell-LaPadula model, assigning a security <b>level</b> <b>to</b> a service may be less intuitive. The justification is that an organization may have differing levels {{of confidence in the}} set of services they wish to use. For example, they may be very confident that a service written in-house, or provided by a trusted supplier, will not reveal the data it consumes and produces to a third party either deliberately or through poor design; in contrast, there is a risk that a service downloaded from the Internet, of unknown provenance, may do just that. Therefore, the organization can assign a high security <b>level</b> <b>to</b> the former service, and a low <b>level</b> <b>to</b> the latter.|$|R

5|$|A heart {{condition}} uncommon to the breed is tetralogy of Fallot, {{which is more}} common in the Keeshond and English Bulldog breeds relatively. It is actually a combination of up to four conditions, including the previously mentioned pulmonary valve stenosis, with a secondary condition of right ventricular hypertrophy.

5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{permanent}} garrisons in Northern Ireland throughout its history, the British Army was deployed as a peacekeeping force from 1969 to 2007 in Operation Banner. Initially, this was (in the wake of unionist attacks on nationalist communities in Derry and Belfast) to prevent further loyalist attacks on Catholic communities; it developed into support of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and its successor, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) against the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA). Under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, there was a gradual {{reduction in the number}} of soldiers deployed. In 2005, after the PIRA declared a ceasefire, the British Army dismantled posts, withdrew many troops and restored troop <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> those of a peace-time garrison.|$|E

5|$|Contributing factors {{leading to}} this award {{included}} that during construction, 92% of construction waste was recycled, and non-wood wheat board {{was used in}} some of the walls. Additionally, 18 solar panels were installed on the building to generate power for use in the building, with the city purchasing all additional power through renewable power sources, funded in part by Portland General Electric and the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, while the building is 42% more energy efficient than comparable buildings. Other environmental friendly amenities include occupancy sensors, ventilation that monitors carbon dioxide <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> determine when to activate, high performance exterior glass to reduce heat loss, infrared bathroom fixtures, and the use of recycled building materials among other items.|$|E

5|$|During {{its three}} years in production, several {{versions}} of Dishonored were developed. Before the creation of Dunwall—inspired by late nineteenth-century London and Edinburgh—the game was set {{to take place in}} medieval Japan and seventeenth-century London.

40|$|The aims of this {{research}} are to examine the influence of autonomy <b>level</b> <b>to</b> fulfill local fiscal’s need, <b>to</b> examine autonomy <b>level</b> <b>to</b> manage local potency and to examine the SiLPA <b>to</b> performaces <b>level</b> of local public service. Measurement used <b>to</b> measure autonomy <b>level</b> <b>to</b> fulfill local fiscal’s need by {{this research}} is proportion between PAD and DAU. While in terms of autonomy <b>level</b> <b>to</b> manage local potency, the measurement used is proportion between PAD and DBH. SiLPA in this research has no measurement since it is directly obtained from penerimaan pembiayaan. Whereas performance level of local public service as a dependent variable is measured by using proportion of capital expenditure and local expenditure. This research uses secondary data with population of all local governments in Indonesia which report its realizations of APBD in DJPK since 2006 until 2012. Purposive sampling is a method used {{in order to determine}} research’s sample. Whereas multiple regression is used as an analysis method. The result shows that autonomy <b>level</b> <b>to</b> fulfill local fiscal’s need (TKMKF) and autonomy <b>level</b> <b>to</b> manage local potency negatively (TKMP) affect performance level of local public service (TKPP) and the SiLPA positively affect performance level of public service (TKPP) ...|$|R

Navaar focuses her attentions on Archer, while D'Nesh seduces Commander Kelby. Arriving at the planet, a sluggish Archer orders Reed to destroy another ship, but he refuses and it escapes. Kelby meanwhile sabotages the warp drive before Commander Tucker can physically stop him. Afterwards, Doctor Phlox determines that the Orions are producing pheromones, causing the crew's adrenaline <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> spike. Only Commander T'Pol and Tucker remain unaffected, since she is Vulcan and he shares her immunity because of their psychic bond.|$|E
5|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the sweep of}} botanical history it is evident that, {{through the power of}} the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global <b>levels)</b> <b>to</b> improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E

The game stars Sonic and Chris, who must rescue Tails, Amy, and Knuckles from Eggman. It is a fast-paced platform/action game in which Sonic runs and jumps through levels and destroys Eggman's robots along the way. Periodically, Sonic must answer math questions to continue. The game features three levels, {{each with its own}} math concepts: the city Station Square (sequencing, counting in increments); Angel Island, the home of the Master Emerald (addition); and Eggman's base (subtraction). There are also math-based minigames unrelated to the <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> supplement these skills.|$|E
