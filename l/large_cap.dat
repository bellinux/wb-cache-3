40|$|In this study, the {{relation}} between accounting information aspects and the capitalization level o companies listed on the São Paulo Stock Exchange was investigated, classified as <b>Large</b> <b>Caps</b> or Small <b>Caps,</b> companies with <b>larger</b> and smaller capitalization, respectively, between 2010 and 2012. Three accounting information measures were addressed: informativeness, conservatism and relevance, {{through the application of}} Easton and Harris’ (1991) models of earnings informativeness, Basu’s (1997) model of conditional conservatism and the value relevance model, based on Ohlson (1995). The results appointed that, although the <b>Large</b> <b>Caps</b> present a higher level of conservatism, their accounting figures were less informative and more relevant when compared to the <b>Large</b> <b>Caps</b> companies. Due to the greater production of private information (predisclosure) surrounding larger companies, the market would tend to respond less strongly or surprised to the publication of these companies’ accounting information, while the lack of anticipated information would make the effect of disclosing these figures more preponderant for the Small Caps companies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the relative performance of small-caps vs. <b>large</b> <b>caps</b> surrounding periods of {{peaks and troughs}} of economic activity, and re{{examines the}} relationship between the small firm anomaly and the business cycle. Small-cap firms outperform <b>large</b> <b>caps</b> over the year subsequent to an economic trough. In the year prior to the business cycle peak, however, small caps tend to lag. US style based <b>large</b> <b>caps</b> perform better over peaks, but there is no dominant category across size and book to market asset classes over troughs. The US small cap premium is related to default risk, although recessions per se do not on average impact on this premium. Default risk and the inflation risk differential between Canada and the US significantly impact on the Canada-US equity premium. Abnormal positive performance observed for US small caps in the recent (post 2001) period {{as well as for the}} long horizon is attributable to the small cap growth cohort.

Mrs. Guppy, occupying the parlours and having indeed been visibly in danger of cracking herself like a nut in the front-parlour door by peeping out before she was asked for, immediately presented herself and requested us to walk in. She was an old lady in a <b>large</b> <b>cap,</b> with rather a red nose and rather an unsteady eye, but smiling all over.

60|$|He sat {{upon the}} padded locker, wrapped about very carefully, for the air, though calm, was exhilaratingly cold and clear. He was wearing first a modest suit of blue serge {{and all the}} unpretending {{underwear}} of a suburban young man of fashion, with sandal-like cycling-shoes and brown stockings drawn over his trouser ends; then the perforated sheet proper to a Desert Dervish; then the coat and waistcoat and big fur-trimmed overcoat of Mr. Butteridge; then a lady's large fur cloak, and round his knees a blanket. Over his head was a tow wig, surmounted by a <b>large</b> <b>cap</b> of Mr. Butteridge's with the flaps down over his ears. And some fur sleeping-boots of Mr. Butteridge's warmed his feet. The car of the balloon was small and neat, some bags of ballast the untidiest of its contents, and {{he had found a}} light folding-table and put it at his elbow, and on that was a glass with champagne.

King Edward Street was a quiet, semi-respectable little street, and {{although it was a}} thoroughfare leading into the Westminster Bridge Road, very few people except its own inhabitants ever passed through it. It was, it seemed, quite a little professional colony. Next door, in the parlours, played first violin at a theatre {{on that side of the}} water, and the one beyond that was second cornet at the Adelphi. The two sisters in the house opposite danced in the ballet at the opera, and worked as milliners in their spare time; next door was a comic singer at Cremorne; and beyond him again lived a leading star and his wife--who was a singing chambermaid, both at the Victoria. They were a kindly, cheerful lot, sociable among themselves, and ready to do any kindness or service to each other. There were a few black sheep among them, but the very blackest of all, Robert and Sophy now suspected Mr. Billow himself, to be.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{composition}} of a target index is a known quantity, relative to actively managed funds, it costs less to run an index fund.

The expense ratio of the average <b>large</b> <b>cap</b> actively managed mutual fund as of 2015 is 1.15%.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, economists, legal experts, {{and policy makers}} have been {{discussing}} the effects of neutral network structures on - among others - innovations by content and application providers. Does network neutrality - the open and non-discriminatory functioning of the internet - provide incentives to innovate?

In this study, SEO concludes that network neutrality enhances innovations by small content and application providers (CAPs), but it also provides benefits for <b>large</b> <b>CAPs</b> and internet service providers (ISPs). Network neutrality enhances innovations through three channels: (i) it reduces the market power of ISPs, (ii) it increases connectivity between end-users and CAPs, and (iii) it helps avoid some costs of traffic shaping {{for the benefit of}} <b>large</b> <b>CAPs</b> and ISPs. The results presented in this study are based on desk research, primarily on findings in the blooming economic literature on network neutrality...|$|R
