25|$|By {{the end of}} the Carboniferous, Gondwana had {{united with}} <b>Laurussia</b> on its western end through {{northern}} South America and northwestern Africa. Siberia was approaching from the northeast, separated from <b>Laurussia</b> only by shallow waters.

25|$|The continents Laurentia and Baltica {{collided}} between 450 and 400Ma, {{during the}} Caledonian Orogeny, to form <b>Laurussia</b> (also known as Euramerica). Traces {{of the mountain}} belt this collision caused {{can be found in}} Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards <b>Laurussia.</b> The collision of Siberia with <b>Laurussia</b> caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with <b>Laurussia</b> is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299Ma) and resulted {{in the formation of the}} last supercontinent, Pangaea.|$|E
25|$|The {{ancestors}} of Eurypterus {{were believed to}} have originated from Baltica (eastern <b>Laurussia,</b> modern western Eurasia) based on the earliest recorded fossils. During the Silurian, they spread to Laurentia (western <b>Laurussia,</b> modern North America) when the two continents began to collide. They rapidly colonized the continent as invasive species, becoming the most dominant eurypterid in the region. This accounts for why {{they are the most}} commonly found genus of eurypterids today. Eurypterus (and other members of Eurypteroidea), however, were unable to cross vast expanses of oceans between the two supercontinents during the Silurian. Their range were thus limited to the coastlines and the large, shallow, and hypersaline inland seas of <b>Laurussia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Variscan or Hercynian orogeny is a {{geologic}} mountain-building event {{caused by}} Late Paleozoic continental collision between Euramerica (<b>Laurussia)</b> and Gondwana {{to form the}} supercontinent of Pangaea.|$|E
25|$|During this period, the landmasses {{were mostly}} {{restricted}} to the southern hemisphere of the Earth, with the supercontinent Gondwana straddling the South Pole. The equator had three continents (Avalonia, Baltica, and Laurentia) which slowly drifted together to form the second supercontinent of <b>Laurussia</b> (also known as Euramerica, {{not to be confused}} with Laurasia).|$|E
25|$|In late Devonian {{and in the}} Carboniferous the {{archipelago}} Armorica of southern Europe, which had rifted off Gondwana after Avalonia later in the Ordovician, was pushed into Avalonia, creating a second range, the North American/European Variscan, {{to the east of}} the Caledonide/Appalachian. The collision of Gondwana proper with <b>Laurussia</b> followed in the early Carboniferous, when the Variscan belt was already in place and actively developing.|$|E
25|$|They are {{now only}} known from fossils from North America, Europe, and northwestern Asia, cratons {{that were the}} former {{components}} of <b>Laurussia.</b> While three species of Eurypterus were purportedly discovered in China in 1957, the evidence of them belonging to the genus (or if they were even eurypterids at all) is nonexistent. No other traces of Eurypterus in modern continents from Gondwana are currently known.|$|E
25|$|Seafloor {{spreading}} {{to the south}} of Avalonia pushed the latter into north Laurentia and thrust up the northern Appalachian Mountains in the acadian phase of the Caledonian orogeny. Contemporaneously the Tornquist Sea between Avalonia and Baltica was entirely closed. Thus Avalonia formed the southern coast of the new continent Euramerica (<b>Laurussia,</b> the Old Red Sandstone continent in present-day North America, British Isles, northern Germany, Scandinavia and western Russia).|$|E
25|$|The {{continent}} Euramerica (or <b>Laurussia)</b> {{was created}} in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica, which rotated into the natural dry zone along the Tropic of Capricorn, which is formed as much in Paleozoic times as nowadays by the convergence of two great air-masses, the Hadley cell and the Ferrel cell. In these near-deserts, the Old Red Sandstone sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron (hematite) characteristic of drought conditions.|$|E
25|$|The Carboniferous {{was a time}} {{of active}} {{mountain}} building, as the supercontinent Pangea came together. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America-Europe (<b>Laurussia)</b> along the present line of eastern North America. This continental collision resulted in the Hercynian orogeny in Europe, and the Alleghenian orogeny in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the Ouachita Mountains. In the same time frame, much of present eastern Eurasian plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the Ural mountains. There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the Rheic Ocean (closed by the assembly of South and North America), the small, shallow Ural Ocean (which was closed by the collision of Baltica, and Siberia continents, creating the Ural Mountains) and Proto-Tethys Ocean.|$|E
2500|$|The Devonian (...) was a {{relatively}} warm period, and probably lacked any glaciers with reconstruction of tropical sea surface temperature from conodont apatite implying an average value of [...] in the Early Devonian. [...] levels dropped steeply throughout the Devonian period as the burial of the newly evolved forests drew carbon out of the atmosphere into sediments; this may be reflected by a Mid-Devonian cooling of around [...] The Late Devonian warmed to levels equivalent to the Early Devonian; {{while there is no}} corresponding increase in [...] concentrations, continental weathering increases (as predicted by warmer temperatures); further, a range of evidence, such as plant distribution, points to Late Devonian warming.

In these near-deserts, the Old Red Sandstone sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron (hematite) characteristic of drought conditions. Near the equator Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe, further raising the northern Appalachian Mountains and forming the Caledonian Mountains in Great Britain and Scandinavia. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of Gondwana. The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere. Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas. The deep, enormous Panthalassa (the [...] "universal ocean") covered the rest of the planet. Other minor oceans were Paleo-Tethys, Proto-Tethys, Rheic Ocean and Ural Ocean (which was closed during the collision with Siberia and Baltica).|$|E

5000|$|The Variscan Orogeny was {{a complex}} affair whereby the former micro-continent of Armorica {{collided}} with <b>Laurussia</b> (otherwise known as Euramerica or the Old Red Continent), {{followed by a}} further collision between Gondwana and the enlarged <b>Laurussia.</b> In Britain it resulted {{in a variety of}} geological structures across the southwest from Pembrokeshire and South Glamorgan in Wales to Devon and Cornwall.Structures include: ...|$|E

50|$|The {{paleogeographic}} {{position of}} the Armorica crustal fragments between the Ordovician and Carboniferous is highly disputed though. There are indications that the Bohemian Massif started moving northward from the Ordovician onward, but many authors place the accretion of the Armorican terranes with the southern margin of <b>Laurussia</b> in the Carboniferous Hercynian orogeny (about 340 million years ago). The Rhenohercynian basin, a back-arc basin, formed at the southern margin of Euramerica just after the Caledonian orogeny. According to these authors, a small rim from Euramerica rifted off when this basin formed. The basin closed when these Caledonian deformed terranes were accreted again to <b>Laurussia</b> during the Hercynian orogeny.|$|E
50|$|Euramerica, {{also known}} as <b>Laurussia,</b> was a minor supercontinent created in the Devonian {{as the result of}} a {{collision}} between the Laurentian, Baltica, and Avalonia cratons. Euramerica became a part of the major supercontinent Pangaea in the Permian.|$|E
50|$|The Variscan (Rheic) plate cycle {{resulted}} {{in the formation of}} Pangea when Gondwana and <b>Laurussia</b> collided. The elimination of the Rheic Ocean caused the formation of a massive mountain range through the border countries of the present day North Sea.|$|E
50|$|The {{southeast}} of the massif forms a third unit, the Moravo-Silesian Zone. This zone includes the Brunovistulian Block, an allochthonous unit thrusted over the Moravo-Silesian crystalline rocks. Contradictionary to {{most parts of the}} Bohemian Massif, the Brunovistulian was originally part of or close to the southern part of <b>Laurussia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Its {{uniqueness}} lies in {{the fact}} that, within a radius of about 50 km, it's possible to see the geologic evidences of the continental collision between <b>Laurussia</b> and Gondwana with the consequent closure of the Rheic Ocean, to form the supercontinent of Pangaea in the Late Paleozoic (Variscan orogeny).|$|E
50|$|The Rheic Ocean was {{an ocean}} which {{separated}} two major palaeocontinents, Gondwana and <b>Laurussia</b> (Laurentia-Baltica-Avalonia). One {{of the principal}} oceans of the Palaeozoic, its sutures today stretches 10000 km from Mexico to Turkey and its closure resulted in the assembly of the supercontinent Pangaea {{and the formation of}} the Variscan-Alleghenian-Ouachita orogenies.|$|E

50|$|The Giessen nappe {{is often}} {{correlated}} with the Harz nappe in the Harz and similar units in the Bohemian Massif in the Czech Republic. These units form the rare erosional leftovers of small microcontinents that were during the Hercynian orogeny squeezed between the paleocontinents Gondwana {{to the south and}} <b>Laurussia</b> to the north.|$|E
50|$|All of the {{fragments}} {{that make up}} the Armorican terrane are thought to have originally formed part of the northern margin of Gondwana. Rifting initiated in the Cambrian to Ordovician although the terrane was still close enough to Gondwana to be affected by the Andean-Saharan glaciation during the late Ordovician. Complete separation from Gondwana, across the developing Paleotethys Ocean, is thought to have occurred {{towards the end of the}} Silurian. At this time Armorica was separated from <b>Laurussia</b> by the Rheic Ocean. One possible model includes Armorica as part of the Hun superterrane, while other show it moving separately. The Rheic Ocean closed during the Devonian and early Carboniferous, as the oceanic crust was subducted. The Variscan orogeny marks the final closure of the Rheic Ocean as the various continental fragments, including Armorica, collided with <b>Laurussia</b> towards the end of the Carboniferous.|$|E
50|$|The Saxothuringian Zone {{forms the}} {{northern}} {{parts of the}} massif. The northernmost part of the Saxothuringian Zone is the Mid-German Crystalline High, which is but rarely exposed in the Bohemian Massif. The northern boundary of this zone {{is assumed to be}} the Rheic suture which separates the former continental masses of Gondwana and <b>Laurussia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{variety of}} fossils found in Ellesmere Island {{is similar to}} those found in the Gauja Formations of Latvia and Estonia, from whence other species of Laccognathus were recovered. North America and western Eurasia were once part of the ancient supercontinent of Euramerica (also known as <b>Laurussia)</b> located at the equator during the Devonian period.|$|E
5000|$|The Rhenohercynian Zone or Rheno-Hercynian zone in {{structural}} geology {{describes a}} fold belt of west and central Europe, formed during the Hercynian orogeny (about [...] ). The zone consists of folded and thrusted Devonian and early Carboniferous sedimentary rocks that were deposited in a back-arc basin {{along the southern}} margin of the then existing paleocontinent <b>Laurussia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Rhenohercynian basin {{disappeared}} {{when the}} continent Gondwana collided with <b>Laurussia</b> {{in the course}} of the Carboniferous period (the Hercynian orogeny). The sedimentary rocks in the basin were thrust in a series of piggyback basins over the northern foreland (the London-Brabant Massif). These rocks now form the folded sequences of Cornwall, the Ardennes, the Eifel and the Harz.|$|E
50|$|The ocean {{located between}} Gondwana and Laurentia in the Early Cambrian {{was named for}} Iapetus, in Greek mythology the father of Atlas, just as the Iapetus Ocean was the {{predecessor}} of the Atlantic Ocean. The ocean between Gondwana and <b>Laurussia</b> (Laurentia-Baltica-Avalonia) in the Late Cambrian-Early Ordovician was named the Rheic Ocean after Rhea, sister of Iapetus.|$|E
5000|$|The {{location}} of Laurentia has changed throughout time. In the late Proterozoic Laurentia {{could be found}} surrounded by Siberia, South Africa, Australia-Antarctica, and Amazonia-Baltica. Laurentia {{during the time of}} super contient Gondwana was smushed in between Eastern and Western Gondwana, but when Gondwana attached to <b>Laurussia</b> to form Pangea, laurentia was moved and was closer to northern Africa.|$|E
50|$|The Caledonian (Iapetus) plate cycle saw the {{formation}} of the Iapetus suture during the Caledonian orogeny. The Iapetus suture was a major weakness creating a volcanic fault in the central North Sea during the later Jurassic period. The Iapetus ocean was replaced with a suture line and mountain range when Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia continents collided. This collision formed <b>Laurussia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Emsian {{stratigraphy}} of {{the southern}} Rhenish Massif {{can be divided into}} two lithological units: the older slates of the Hunsrück-Schiefer and the younger sandstones of the Singhofener Schichten. Stratigraphically below the Hunsrück Slates is the (older) Taunus quartzite. All these metasedimentary rocks were originally deposited in the marine Rhenohercynian Basin, a back-arc basin south of the paleocontinent of <b>Laurussia.</b>|$|E
