5|$|The Germans swiftly mobilised {{to expel}} the Allied forces and {{launched}} heavy air assaults on Kos and <b>Leros.</b> Without fighter support, the islands' defence was soon precarious; the LRDG {{and the rest}} of the troops on Kalymnos were withdrawn to <b>Leros</b> on 4 October after the Germans won the Battle of Kos. German air assaults on <b>Leros</b> intensified during late October, and at dawn on 12 November 1943 the Germans attacked <b>Leros</b> by sea and air. During the ensuing Battle of <b>Leros,</b> the LRDG Rhodesians at Point 320, commanded by Rhodesian Captain JR Olivey, spiked their position's guns and withdrew before counter-attacking and retaking the point the next day. They held that position for three more days, during which they learned that the Germans were winning the battle. On 16 November, Olivey decided that holding the point any longer was pointless and ordered his men to split up, escape by any means possible and re-assemble in Cairo. Over half of the unit reached Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In May 1943 the LRDG {{was sent}} to Lebanon to retrain in {{mountain}} warfare. However, following the Italian armistice in 1943, they were sent to <b>Leros,</b> one of the Dodecanese islands, to serve as normal infantry. They later {{took part in the}} Battle of <b>Leros,</b> where the commanding officer John Richard Easonsmith was killed and replaced by David Lloyd Owen. After the battle the last New Zealanders, two officers and approximately 46 men, were withdrawn from the LRDG and returned to their division.|$|E
5|$|They later {{operated}} {{among the}} Dodecanese and Cyclades groups of {{islands in the}} Dodecanese Campaign and {{took part in the}} Battle of <b>Leros</b> and the Battle of Kos. They with Greek Sacred Band took part in the successful Raid on Symi in July 1944 in which the entire German garrison was either killed or captured. In August 1944, they joined with the Long Range Desert Group in operations in the Adriatic, on the Peloponnese, in Albania, and, finally, Istria. So effective were they that, by 1944, 200–300 SBS men held down six German divisions.|$|E
40|$|Low-erucic acid {{rapeseed}} oil (<b>LERO)</b> and hydrogenated low-erucic acid {{rapeseed oil}} (HLERO) were blended in binary systems. The blends were then studied for their physical properties such as solid fat content, melting curves by DSC, textural properties, and polymorphism. Phase behavior diagrams were constructed from the DSC and X-ray results, and isosolid diagrams were constructed from the NMR results. The mixture of HLERO and <b>LERO</b> displayed a monotectic behavior {{for all the}} storage time at 15 degreesC. The aim of this work was to evaluate physical characteristics of binary blends of HLERO and nonhydrogenated <b>LERO</b> {{in order to use}} only <b>LERO</b> and hardened <b>LERO</b> in bakery shortenings. The mixture of 60 % HLERO and 40 % <b>LERO</b> is suitable to use as a plastic shortening, This blend is beta tending upon storage at 15 degreesC. It could be used in pie crust applications.

5|$|Southern Rhodesia was {{represented}} in the Dodecanese Campaign of September–November 1943 by the Long Range Desert Group, which was withdrawn from the North African front in March 1943. After retraining for mountain operations in Lebanon, the LRDG moved in late September to the Dodecanese island of Kalymnos, north-west of Kos and south-east of <b>Leros,</b> {{off the coast of}} south-west Turkey. In the fall-out from the armistice between Italy and the Allies, which had been concluded {{in the first week of}} September, the Allies were attempting to capture the Dodecanese so the islands could be used as bases against the German-occupied Balkans. Most of the Italian forces had changed sides; the LRDG found itself in an infantry role, acting as a mobile reserve for Italian troops.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of <b>Leros,</b> New Zealand withdrew its {{squadron}} {{from the}} Long Range Desert Group, compelling the LRDG to reorganise itself into two squadrons of eight patrols each. A Squadron {{was composed of}} Rhodesians and B Squadron comprised British troops and a squadron of signallers; around 80 of the officers and men were from Southern Rhodesia. The group was reassigned from the Middle East Command to the Central Mediterranean Force in early 1944, and deployed to the Gargano peninsula in south-eastern Italy, where a new LRDG headquarters was set up near the seaside town of Rodi. Britain hoped to compel the Germans to commit as many divisions as possible to south-eastern Europe so {{they could not be}} used on the more important fronts closer to Germany. In June 1944 the LRDG was assigned to operate on the western coast of Yugoslavia, with orders to set up observation posts, report the movements of German ships and undertake minor raids.|$|E
5|$|On 67 July 1933, Trento {{took part}} in a major fleet review held in the Gulf of Naples for Italian {{dictator}} Benito Mussolini. Trento became the flagship of the 2nd Division, 1st Squadron on 2 December. The ship visited Durazzo on 2326 June 1934, and on 1 July, became the flagship of the 3rd Division. She made another cruise in the eastern Mediterranean from 8 to 20 March 1935, during which she made calls in Rhodes and <b>Leros.</b> On 18 June, Trieste temporarily relieved Trento as the divisional flagship. Another naval review was held in the Gulf of Naples on 27 November 1936, to honor the Regent of Hungary, Miklós Horthy, who was visiting Italy at the time. Trieste again replaced Trento as the flagship on 27 January 1937. From 10 to 12 March 1937, Mussolini took a short tour of Italian Libya aboard the heavy cruiser , escorted by Trento. The two cruisers stopped in Benghazi, Tripoli, and Ra's Lanuf during the trip.|$|E
5|$|During the 1923 Corfu {{incident}} with Greece, the Italian Navy, including Andrea Doria, was deployed {{to the island}} to secure a Greek apology following the murder of Enrico Tellini and four others. Following the peaceful resolution of the incident, Andrea Doria visited Spain. On 16 January 1925, Andrea Doria visited Lisbon {{to participate in the}} 400th anniversary of the death of Vasco de Gama. She thereafter went to La Spezia for a refit, which began on 7 February and was completed by June. Following civil unrest in Syria, Andrea Doria steamed to the eastern Mediterranean with a squadron of destroyers in the event that Italian nationals would need to be evacuated. The ships remained docked in <b>Leros</b> until 12 December, by which time the disturbances in Syria had been calmed down. She spent the next six years on normal peacetime duties, until she was withdrawn from service in August 1932. She was placed in reserve in Taranto, with a skeleton crew for maintenance. In March 1937, she started the major reconstruction in Trieste, where she arrived on the 30th. The refit began on 8 April at the Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico shipyard.|$|E

25|$|On 17 September {{the small}} Italian {{garrison}} of Alimia, after leaving their island on board two fishing boats, reached <b>Leros</b> with their weapons (the influx of soldiers from Rhodes and Alimia brought the total Italian troops to 8,320), {{and on the}} same day the first 400 British reinforcements landed on <b>Leros.</b> On 20 September Captain Mascherpa, upon hearing that British Major-General Frank G. R. Brittorous was coming to <b>Leros,</b> asked Supermarina (the command of the Royal Italian Navy) for an advancement to the rank of Rear Admiral (so {{that he would not be}} junior in rank to Brittorous), which was granted. On the same day, Brittorous reached <b>Leros</b> with 600 more men, food and equipment (carried by a steamer, two destroyers and smaller vessels). Brittorous published a proclamation where he stated that he was in command, and all Italian commands were subordinated to him; this immediately created frictions with Mascherpa, who was confirmed in command of all Italian forces in <b>Leros</b> as well as of the civilian population, but subordinated to Brittorous. Both officers asked their commands for reinforcements, food and ammunitions, but little arrived.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 10/11 November, destroyers HMS Petard, Rockwood and ORP Krakowiak bombarded Kalymnos and HMS Faulknor bombarded Kos, where German forces were {{assembling}} for the attack on <b>Leros.</b> The German convoy reached <b>Leros</b> on 12 November, escorted by over 25 ships, mostly submarine chasers, torpedo boats and mineweepers. During the subsequent nights, Allied destroyers failed to find and destroy the German vessels, limiting themselves to bombarding the German positions on <b>Leros.</b> With the fall of <b>Leros</b> on 16 November, the Allied ships were withdrawn, evacuating the remaining British garrisons. By that time, the Germans had also used Dornier Do 217s of Kampfgeschwader 100 (KG 100), with their novel Henschel Hs 293 radio-controlled missile, scoring two hits. One caused severe damage to HMS Rockwood on 11 November; one sank HMS Dulverton two days later. The Allies lost six destroyers sunk and two cruisers and two destroyers damaged between 7 September and 28 November 1943.|$|E

25|$|Kalimnos {{had fallen}} to the Germans on 7 September, and three days later the {{batteries}} of <b>Leros</b> had started firing on that island. This continuous firing, along with the constant air strikes, wore the guns, and seriously depleted the ammunition reserves; the local command asked for more ammunitions, and the destroyer Artigliere and Velite were sent from Taranto, but most of their cargo of ammunition was unloaded during their stop in Alexandria, so only a minimal part of them was eventually delivered to <b>Leros.</b> In {{the last part of}} October, Italian and British submarines made several supply runs to Leros: HMS Rorqual (three), HMS Severn (three), the Italian submarines Zoea (two), Atropo (one), Filippo Corridoni (one) and Ciro Menotti (one); overall, the submarines brought to <b>Leros</b> 17 men, 225 tons of supplies, twelve 40mm Bofors guns, and one jeep.

25|$|In the 1943 Dodecanese Campaign, Luftwaffe {{units were}} {{instrumental}} in stopping the British Army from getting control of strategic islands like <b>Leros</b> and Kos. During the Battle of <b>Leros</b> they brought {{about one of the}} last German victories in World War II. The Luftwaffe remained in the Mediterranean theatre {{until the end of the}} war in May 1945. The most notable fighter unit in North Africa was Jagdgeschwader 27 that for nearly eighteen months (April 1941 – October 1942) was the only fighter unit in North Africa, although many other fighter units took part throughout the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|Despite this setback, the British High Command pressed {{ahead with}} the {{occupation}} of the other islands, especially the three larger ones of Kos, Samos and <b>Leros.</b> The Germans {{were known to be}} overstretched in the Aegean, while the Allies enjoyed superiority at sea and the air cover provided by 7 Squadron, SAAF and 74 Squadron, RAF (Supermarine Spitfires) at Kos was deemed sufficient. It was hoped that from these islands, with Italian cooperation, an assault against Rhodes could be eventually launched. From 10 to 17 September, the 234th Infantry Brigade (Major-General F. G. R. Brittorous) coming from Malta, together with 160 men from the Special Boat Service, 130 men from the Long Range Desert Group, A Company of the 11th Battalion, Parachute Regiment and Greek Sacred Band detachments had secured the islands of Kos, Kalymnos, Samos, <b>Leros,</b> Symi and Astypalaia, supported by ships of the Royal Navy and Royal Hellenic Navy. The Germans quickly mobilized in response. By 19 September, Karpathos, Kasos and the Italian-occupied islands of the Sporades and the Cyclades were in German hands. On 23 September, the 22nd Infantry Division (Lieutenant-General Friedrich-Wilhelm Müller) garrisoning Fortress Crete was ordered to take Kos and <b>Leros.</b>|$|E

Microstructure was also observed by microscopy in order to explain the variability in hardness for samples having the same SFC values. The blends studied by microscopy were the following: HSO, HPO and HLERO diluted in <b>LERO.</b> For these three blends which had the same SFC the level of network structure was different. HSO diluted in <b>LERO</b> had more crystals, closer {{to each other and}} overlapped. This can explain that HSO has a higher hardness than HPO or HLERO, for a same SFC value, when diluted in <b>LERO.</b> Polymorphism was also observed by powder X-ray diffraction. The variability in hardness for samples having the same SFC is due to various crystal types and/or network structures that are formed upon crystallization of hard fats. This work demonstrates that for binary blends of studied oils, changes in the hardness are controlled mostly by the SFC, polymorphism and also by the material's microstructure. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
