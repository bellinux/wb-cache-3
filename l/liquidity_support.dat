This model modifies and broadens the Corsetti, Guimaraes and Roubini (2003) model based on global games theory. In the first part we assert the implications for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as an international lender of last resort, utilising existing literature based on multiple equilibria models. In the second part, we extend the analysis and highlight the interesting implications. The model predicts the IMF should not be too conservative in its decisions, while avoiding the excessive <b>liquidity</b> <b>supports,</b> which can lead to moral hazard distortions. ...|$|R

25|$|On 12 September 2007, Northern Rock {{asked the}} Bank of England, as lender {{of last resort}} in the United Kingdom, for a <b>liquidity</b> <b>support</b> {{facility}} due to problems in raising funds in the money market to replace maturing money market borrowings. The problems arose from difficulties banks faced over the summer of 2007 in raising funds in the money market. The bank's assets were always sufficient to cover its liabilities in the long run, {{but it had a}} liquidity problem because institutional lenders became nervous about lending to mortgage banks following the US sub-prime crisis. Bank of England figures suggest that Northern Rock borrowed £3 billion from the Bank of England in {{the first few days of}} this crisis.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{chairmanship}} of Matt Ridley, Northern Rock had a business plan which involved borrowing heavily in the UK and international money markets, extending mortgages to customers based on this funding, and then re-selling these mortgages on international capital markets, {{a process known as}} securitisation. In August 2007, when the global demand from investors for securitised mortgages was falling away, the lack of money raised by this meant that Northern Rock became unable to repay loans from the money market. This problem had been anticipated by the financial markets, which drew greater attention to it. On 14 September 2007, the bank sought and received a <b>liquidity</b> <b>support</b> facility from the Bank of England, to replace funds it was unable to raise from the money market. This led to panic among individual depositors, who feared that their savings might not be available should Northern Rock go into receivership. The result was a bank run – the UK's first in 150 years – where depositors lined up outside the bank to withdraw all of their savings as quickly as possible, particularly since everyone else was doing the same.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} foreign currency derivatives (FCD) in alleviating foreign exchange rate exposure of Australian firms. While {{there is some evidence}} that the use of FCD reduces the level of ex-post short-term exposure, such an effect is absent with regard to the degree of foreign operations. Our results support the view that FCDs are used to hedge existing exchange rate exposures and that Australian firms, generally, are extensively exposed to currency fluctuations in the long run. While monthly exposure appears to be a function of a firm 2 ̆ 7 s size and financial hedging, exchange rate exposure of shorter horizons (1 and 3 months) appears to be negatively related to a firm 2 ̆ 7 s price earnings ratio (proxying growth opportunities) —thereby supporting the ‘underinvestment’ hypothesis.

By that point the government had extended <b>liquidity</b> <b>support</b> of tens of billions of pounds [...] to Northern Rock.

2500|$|... "The [...] {{directors}} of Northern Rock were the principal {{authors of the}} difficulties {{that the company has}} faced since August 2007. It is right that members of the Board of Northern Rock have been replaced, though haphazardly, since the company became dependent on <b>liquidity</b> <b>support</b> from the Bank of England. The high-risk, reckless business strategy of Northern Rock, with its reliance on short- and medium-term wholesale funding and an absence of sufficient insurance and a failure to arrange standby facility or cover that risk, meant that it was unable to cope with the liquidity pressures placed upon it by the freezing of international capital markets in August 2007. Given that the formulation of that strategy was a fundamental role of the Board of Northern Rock, overseen by some directors who had been there since its demutualisation, the failure of that strategy must also be attributed to the Board. The non-executive members of the Board, and in particular the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Risk Committee and the senior non-executive director, failed in the case of Northern Rock to ensure that it remained liquid as well as solvent, to provide against the risks that it was taking and to act as an effective restraining force on the strategy of the executive members." ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} three essays analyzing {{the role of}} fiat money in decentralized trade. Essay 1 develops a model that describes a two-country-two-currency economy, in which prices are endogenized by using the “split-the-surplus” rule. The government generates seignorage revenue by issuing money to newborn citizen in return for goods. This process induces inflation and agents start using the foreign currency as a hedge against inflation on their own currency. This framework offers the possibility to analyze the main determinants of currency substitution and its implications on welfare and seignorage revenues. ^ Essay 2 also studies endogenous currency substitution and price formation in a general equilibrium model with bilateral and decentralized international trade. In contrast to essay 1, {{there is a lack}} of government and prices are more realistically determined. In particular, sellers of homogenous goods choose to post prices in either of two currencies given that buyers 2 ̆ 7 valuation is unobservable. It is shown that the absence of well-integrated international goods markets does not necessarily imply a violation of the law of one price. In equilibrium goods may be priced only in the local currency, but scarcity of local <b>liquidity</b> <b>supports</b> equilibria with currency substitution where the law of one price holds. By fostering trade, international circulation of money may enhance welfare. ^ Finally, essay 3 analyses the relation between welfare and the taxation of money in a search-theoretic framework with flexible prices. In a model, closely related to that by Li (1995), prices are endogenously determined in the two most commonly used ways. First, buyers make take-it-or-leave-it offers to sellers. Second, using the price formation developed in essay 2, sellers post prices for their goods. In this decentralized trading environment buyers must exert effort to meet buyers, which gives rise to a trading externality. In contrast to Li 2 ̆ 7 s result with fixed prices, the externality cannot be internalized by taxing money holdings since prices are free to adjust to this additional trading friction. ...|$|R

40|$|The first {{essay is}} the result of work with Paul Borochin. We perform the first large-sample {{estimation}} of the Volume Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading (VPIN) measure on the NYSE TAQ universe, enabling us to test the validity of VPIN with high statistical power and to do traditional asset pricing tests of informed trading. Informed trading measured by VPIN is priced, and is not explained by firm characteristics such as volume, volatility, or <b>liquidity,</b> <b>supporting</b> the validity of the measure. Additionally, we create a novel signed version of VPIN (SVPIN) to identify the direction of informed trades. A portfolio long low-VPIN stocks and short high-VPIN ones delivers a monthly five-factor alpha of. 18 %, which rises to. 29 % when using SVPIN. A trading strategy following the SVPIN factor delivers an annualized five-factor BHAR of 11. 45 %. We further document a reversal in stock performance in portfolio sorts on SVPIN, the incorporation of which into a trading strategy improves performance to an annualized BHAR of 17. 34 %. The second essay is a sole authored paper that explores whether information asymmetry in equity markets is a determinant of information diffusion from currency markets. It provides evidence that price delay attributed to currency information is different than price delay attributed to the market risk premium. Furthermore, information asymmetry is a determinant of price delay and price delay attributed to currency information produces abnormal returns of 6. 32 % per year. The third essay is another joint project with Paul Borochin. We create and test two novel network-based measures of interconnectedness in the financial industry during 1996 to 2013. A network based on informed trading in financial firms predicts firm-specific risk and performance, while one formed on financial firm returns predicts future macroeconomic risk. A trading strategy based on informed trading network centrality in the financial sector delivers an annualized four-factor CAR of 7. 73 %...|$|R
40|$|Credit {{networks}} are an abstraction for modeling trust between agents in a network. Agents {{who do not}} directly trust each other can transact through exchange of IOUs (obligations) along a chain of trust in the network. Credit {{networks are}} robust to intrusion, can enable transactions between strangers in exchange economies, and have the <b>liquidity</b> to <b>support</b> {{a high rate of}} transactions. We study the formation of such networks when agents strategically decide how much credit to extend each other. When each agent trusts a fixed set of other agents, and transacts directly only with those it trusts, the formation game is a potential game and all Nash equilibria are social optima. Moreover, the Nash equilibria of this game are equivalent in a very strong sense: the sequences of transactions that can be supported from each equilibrium credit network are identical.
