5|$|Connected to a {{spur of the}} Stobcross Railway, the crane's {{primary purpose}} was the <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> heavy machinery, such as tanks and steam {{locomotives}}, onto ships for export. As many as 30,000 locomotives were hauled {{through the streets of}} Glasgow by Clydesdale horses, traction engines and diesel tractors, from the works at Springburn to the crane for export to the British Empire. The crane is (as of 1988) not in working order, but is retained {{as a symbol of the}} city's engineering heritage.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate was {{considering}} {{whether or not}} to prosecute WCRC. The ORR also has powers to prosecute; they subsequently decided to prosecute both WCRS and the driver of the train.

The <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> the suspension by NR was subject to a review after three months.|$|E
5|$|It {{is one of}} the few {{traditional}} sports {{not solely}} the preserve of the samurai class, being popular among peasants and sake brewers. Both professions valued the manual labor of young people, and similar practices called kyokumochi also existed, which involved lifting sacks of rice or barrels of sake. The sporting aspect of stone-lifting developed in Edo around the seventeenth century, likely evolving from the sack-lifting contests of the stevedores and labourers. Historically, the <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> strength-stones was exclusively practiced by men.|$|E
25|$|Grasp has {{heavy lift}} system that {{consists}} of large bow and stern rollers, deck machinery, and tackle. The rollers serve as low-friction fairlead for the wire rope or chain used for the lift. The tackle and deck machinery provide up to 75 tons of hauling for each lift. The two bow rollers can be used together with linear hydraulic pullers to achieve a dynamic <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> 150 tons. The stern rollers {{can be used with}} the automatic towing machine to provide a dynamic <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> 150 tons.

5|$|Orographic or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air pushed by wind are forced {{up the side}} of elevated land formations, such as large mountains. The <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> air {{up the side of}} a mountain or range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer air on the descending, leeward side. The resulting enhanced productivity of snow fall and the decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|E

5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> {{the five-year}} ban on English clubs from European competitions, {{which had been}} imposed after the Heysel Stadium disaster, United became England's first {{entrants}} into the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in the 1990–91 season. Bruce played regularly, and scored three goals, in the team's progress to the final against FC Barcelona. He came close to scoring the first goal, only for Mark Hughes to deflect the ball over the line and claim the goal, and United {{went on to win}} the game 2–1. This was a particularly high-scoring season for Bruce, who found the net 13times in the First Division and 19times in total in all competitions. He also played again at Wembley, in the Football League Cup final, in which United were defeated by Sheffield Wednesday of the Second Division.|$|E

5|$|Historians' {{opinions}} {{on the outcome of}} the battle are mixed, with some citing the withdrawal of Tegetthoff's ships, and the greater damage they sustained, as evidence of a tactical victory for Suenson. Other naval historians cite the <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> the blockade as a strategic victory for the Austrians and Prussians, and others still describe the battle as inconclusive. The Battle of Heligoland was the last naval battle fought by squadrons of wooden ships, and it was also the last time Danish warships fought a major action.

5|$|On 7 August, a {{fleet of}} Persian rafts {{ferrying}} troops across the Bosphorus were surrounded and destroyed by Byzantine ships. The Slavs under the Avars attempted to attack the sea walls from across the Golden Horn, while the main Avar host attacked the land walls.

With the news that Theodore had decisively triumphed over Shahin (supposedly leading Shahin to die from depression), the Avars retreated to the Balkan hinterland within two days, never to seriously threaten Constantinople again. Even though the army of Shahrbaraz was still encamped at Chalcedon, the threat to Constantinople was over.

5|$|Peking opera was {{initially}} an exclusively male pursuit. The Qianlong Emperor had banned all female performers in Beijing in 1772. The appearance {{of women on}} the stage began unofficially during the 1870s. Female performers began to impersonate male roles and declared equality with men. They were given a venue for their talents when Li Maoer, himself a former Peking-opera performer, founded the first female Peking-opera troupe in Shanghai. By 1894, the first commercial venue showcasing female performance troupes appeared in Shanghai. This encouraged other female troupes to form, which gradually increased in popularity. As a result, theatre artist Yu Zhenting petitioned for the <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> the ban after {{the founding of the}} Republic of China in 1911. This was accepted, and the ban was lifted in 1912, although male Dan continued to be popular after this period.|$|E

40|$|Given a polytope P ⊂ Rn, we {{say that}} P has a {{positive}} semidefinite <b>lift</b> (psd <b>lift)</b> <b>of</b> size d if one can express P as the linear projection of an affine slice of the positive semidefinite cone Sd+. If a polytope P has symmetry, we can consider equivariant psd lifts, i. e. those psd lifts that respect the symmetry of P. One of the simplest families of polytopes with interesting symmetries are regular polygons in the plane, which have {{played an important role}} in the study <b>of</b> linear programming <b>lifts</b> (or extended formulations). In this paper we study equivariant psd <b>lifts</b> <b>of</b> regular polygons. We first show that the standard Lasserre/sum-of-squares hierarchy for the regular N-gon requires exactly dN/ 4 e iterations and thus yields an equivariant psd <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> size linear in N. In contrast we show that one can construct an equivariant psd <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> the regular 2 n-gon of size 2 n − 1, which is exponentially smaller than the psd <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> the sum-of-squares hierarchy. Our construction relies on finding a sparse sum-of-squares certificate for the facet-defining inequalities of the regular 2 n-gon, i. e., one that only uses a small (logarithmic) number of monomials. Since any equivariant LP <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> the regular 2 n-gon must have size 2 n, this gives the first example of a polytope with an exponential gap between sizes <b>of</b> equivariant LP <b>lifts</b> and equivariant psd lifts. Finally we prove that our construction is essentially optimal by showing that any equivariant psd <b>lift</b> <b>of</b> the regular N-gon must have size at least logarithmic in N...|$|R
