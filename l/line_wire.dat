25|$|In some multi-standard sockets the {{aperture}} size for NEMA plugs {{is the same}} for both Line (Hot) and Neutral (see second picture), which may defeat the polarization of NEMA 1 plugs. In a socket designed to accept both NEMA and BS 1363 plugs, the lower right contact (in the orientation shown in the picture) should be connected to the <b>Line</b> <b>wire</b> for BS 1363 plugs, but the Neutral wire for NEMA plugs, so safe wiring of these devices for universal use is not possible.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the plug}} is polarised, CEE7 does not define the {{placement}} of the line and neutral and there is no universally-observed standard. However, the Czech standard recommends that the <b>line</b> <b>wire</b> to be on the left side when facing the socket. The French convention changed circa 2002 from nothing particular, to, if the earth pin was at the top then the line hole in the socket would be on the right looking at the socket. However, the socket may not necessarily be installed with the earth pin at the top. Packaging in France of sockets is normally marked with correct connection of the cables. Polarised pre-fitted plugs on appliances are therefore connected with the brown <b>line</b> <b>wire</b> to the right pin and the blue neutral wire to the left, the earth being connected to the contact at the [...] "top" [...] of the plug.|$|E
2500|$|The {{organisation}} {{of artillery}} was revised {{according to a}} War Office pamphlet of January 1917, [...] "Artillery Notes [...] in Offensive Operations", which put the artillery of each corps under one commander, established a Counter Bombardment Staff Officer, provided for the artillery of several divisions to be co-ordinated and laid down that artillery matters were to be considered from the beginning when planning an attack. The uses of equipment were standardised, the 18-pounder field gun was to be mainly used for barrages, bombardment of German infantry in the open, obstructing communications close to the front <b>line,</b> <b>wire</b> cutting, destroying breastworks and preventing the repair of defences, using high explosive (H. E.), Shrapnel shell and the new smoke shells. The QF 4.5-inch howitzer was {{to be used for}} neutralising German artillery with gas shells, bombarding weaker defences, blocking communication trenches, night barrages and wire-cutting on ground where field guns could not reach. The BL 60 pounder gun was to be used for longer-range barrages and counter-battery fire, the 6-inch Gun for counter-battery fire, neutralisation-fire and wire-cutting using fuze 106. The larger howitzers were reserved for counter-battery fire against well-protected German artillery and the larger guns for long-range fire against targets like road junctions, bridges and headquarters.|$|E

5000|$|Contrary to {{ordinary}} coincident-current magnetic-core memory, {{which was used}} for RAM at the time, the ferrite cores in a core rope are just used as transformers. The signal from a word <b>line</b> <b>wire</b> passing through a given core is coupled to the bit <b>line</b> <b>wire</b> and interpreted as a binary [...] "one", while a word <b>line</b> <b>wire</b> that bypasses the core is not coupled to the bit <b>line</b> <b>wire</b> and is read as a [...] "zero".

25|$|UTPs are {{the best}} {{balanced}} <b>line</b> <b>wires</b> available. However they are the easiest to tap into. When interference and security are concerns, shielded cable or fiber optic cable is often considered.|$|R

5000|$|A {{crown block}} is the {{stationary}} {{section of a}} block and tackle that contains a set of pulleys or sheaves through which the drill <b>line</b> (<b>wire</b> rope) is threaded or reeved and is opposite and above the traveling block.|$|E
5000|$|A {{more common}} {{approach}} is [...] "covered" [...] <b>line</b> <b>wire.</b> It {{is treated as}} bare cable, but often is safer for wildlife, as the insulation on the cables {{increases the likelihood of}} a large-wing-span raptor to survive a brush with the lines, and reduces the overall danger of the lines slightly. These types of lines are often seen in the eastern United States and in heavily wooded areas, where tree-line contact is likely. The only pitfall is cost, as insulated wire is often costlier than its bare counterpart. Many utility companies implement covered <b>line</b> <b>wire</b> as jumper material where the wires are often closer to each other on the pole, such as an underground riser/pothead, and on reclosers, cutouts and the like.|$|E

5000|$|The line {{to ground}} voltage is half the line-to-line voltage. Lighting and small {{appliances}} are connected between a <b>line</b> <b>wire</b> and the neutral. Large appliances, such as cooking equipment, space heating, water pumps, clothes dryers, and air conditioners are connected across the two line conductors, requiring less current and smaller conductors than would be needed if the appliances were designed for the lower voltage.|$|E
50|$|Radial and loop: A circuit {{where each}} load is {{supplied}} {{by a single}} cable; i.e., the cables branch, or radiate, outwards from a single supply point.

50|$|To provide {{cathodic}} {{protection against corrosion}} of <b>line</b> <b>wires,</b> operating potential of telephone lines is typically negative with respect to ground, and the tip side is generally {{close to the ground}} potential.

5000|$|The AFCI is {{intended}} to prevent fire from arcs. AFCI circuit breakers are designed to meet one of two standards as specified by UL 1699: [...] "branch" [...] type or [...] "combination" [...] type (note: the Canadian Electrical Code uses different terminology but similar technical requirements). A branch type AFCI trips on 75 amperes of arcing current from the <b>line</b> <b>wire</b> to either the neutral or ground wire. A combination type adds series arcing detection to branch type performance. Combination type AFCIs trip on 5 amperes of series arcing.|$|E
50|$|Currently {{the policy}} being {{set forth by}} the FCC has two {{different}} levels of regulation. One for fixed <b>line,</b> <b>wire</b> line communications {{and the other for}} wireless communications. Their current tenets strictly regulate network neutrality on wire line networks. However the commission is placing as many mandates on wireless communications. This means that wireless telecommunications providers are not permitted to block any website, but they may block applications and services unless they are direct competitors to the provider's content or services. This difference between the two technologies creates a major loophole in telecommunications policy, as most providers have already begun the shift from wired to wireless network infrastructures.|$|E
30|$|The {{diameter}} of the MV overhead <b>lines</b> <b>wire</b> is usually between 10 and 20  mm, and their average height above the ground level is approximately 10  m.

50|$|These devices sense {{a voltage}} {{to decide the}} Earth leakage. A {{single-phase}} voltage ELCB will have six terminals. Line in and out, neutral in and out, Earth (E), and fault (F). Metal body of the load {{is connected to the}} fault terminal of ELCB and Earth terminal is connected to the ground. For normal working, voltage across the trip coil is zero, because, the body of the load is isolated from the supply line. When an Earth fault occur on the load, due to the contact of <b>line</b> <b>wire</b> to the metal body, a current will flow through F to the ground. This current will set up a voltage across the trip coil, which is connected between E and F. The energized trip coil will trip the circuit to protect the load device and the user.|$|E
