40|$|In {{this paper}} a method is {{introduced}} how to automate the test program implementation process using generic code templates. The basic concept of templates {{is to offer}} the user form sheets, {{which can be used}} to instantiate generic test functions and to generate tester code fitting smoothly into a production test program [...] For this purpose a template is composed of different parts, which contain native test system specific code, user configurable parameters, references to external data bases and special syntax elements in order to control the code generation process. During our work especially the generation of mixed-signal tester code is addressed. 2.

Makes tests from points within VLSI chip {{as well as}} at input and output pins. Used for quality control and design; in latter capacity, checks internal logic functions on chip and feed results directly to computer-aided design system for correction. Also simulates operation of chip design before chip is made. VLSI Tester contains three power supplies, control logic, and standard multibus circuit board in aluminum chassis.

It is able to detect and identify opens and shorts in a few seconds, {{on both sides of}} the printed circuit board simultaneously (surface-mount technology allows boards to have components on both sides), with 4000 nonmultiplexed test points per side.

40|$|The testing scLAN, Test scLAN, is an {{approach}} {{to the design of}} integrated testing systems. Its objective is to provide a <b>linked</b> network of <b>testers</b> such that clients (jobs) requiring testing services can be served efficiently with minimum delays through the use of priority assignment, time-out, and resource allocation protocols. Previous research has shown this approach to yield improved performance; although, it assumes that the conditions used to develop the protocols are static. However, events such as demand fluctuation and design changes can affect the factors used in the protocol logic, thereby adversely affecting the performance of the system. Therefore, this research investigates the thresholds of change and time at which protocols should undergo reevaluation. Furthermore, it provides a mechanism for evaluating the expected results of implementing a Test scLAN in a given system. The results of these experiments show that significant improvements can be gained via protocol adaptation. In certain cases improvements in the flow time by as much as 32 % as compared to the non-adaptable Test scLAN are realized. However, differences among adaptation types are far more difficult to discern as they are dependent upon the particular case. Whereas in many cases thresholds of 0. 5 reduced flow times, these thresholds are not general. The three main contributions of this research are: (1) a simulator of the Test scLAN system which can be used to gauge expected performance of implementing a Test scLAN; (2) guidelines regarding methods of adaptability that can be implemented in the design of a Test scLAN and the thresholds at which adaptations should occur; and (3) the expected cost and value of implementing an adaptable system. ...|$|R
