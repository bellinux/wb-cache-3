25|$|The <b>Lactoferrin</b> anti-viral {{activity}} is sialic acid dependent.|$|E
25|$|Colostrum {{also has}} {{antioxidant}} components, such as <b>lactoferrin</b> and hemopexin, which binds free heme in the body.|$|E
25|$|Also {{increased}} levels of <b>lactoferrin</b> and transferrin inhibit bacterial growth by binding iron, an essential nutrient for bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Stool {{leukocyte}} {{measurements and}} stool <b>lactoferrin</b> levels {{also have been}} proposed as diagnostic tests, but may have limited diagnostic accuracy.|$|E
25|$|MRPs {{can also}} contain other ingredients, such as {{creatine}} monohydrate, glutamine peptides, L-glutamine, calcium alpha-ketoglutarate, additional amino acids, <b>lactoferrin,</b> conjugated linoleic acid, and medium-chain triglycerides.|$|E
25|$|Ventria Bioscience has genetically {{modified}} rice to express <b>lactoferrin,</b> lysozyme which are proteins usually found in breast milk, and human serum albumin, These proteins have antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal effects.|$|E
25|$|Breast milk {{contains}} several anti-infective {{factors such}} as bile salt stimulated lipase (protecting against amoebic infections) and <b>lactoferrin</b> (which binds to iron and inhibits the growth of intestinal bacteria).|$|E
25|$|Dedicated {{antimicrobials}} include lactic, citric and acetic acid, sodium diacetate, acidified {{sodium chloride}} or calcium sulfate, cetylpyridinium chloride, activated <b>lactoferrin,</b> sodium or potassium lactate, or bacteriocins such as nisin.|$|E
25|$|The {{structures}} of the polypeptide chain and carbohydrate moieties of bovine <b>lactoferrin</b> (bLF) are well established. bLF consists of a 689-amino acid polypeptide chain to which complex and high-mannose-type glycans are linked.|$|E
25|$|Sialic acid: during lactation, {{neutralizing}} oligo-saccharides binding sialic acid decreases when it binds {{increasingly to}} glycoproteins. (The APN is a glycoprotein). The anti-viral effect of <b>lactoferrin</b> is increased by {{the removal of}} sialic acid.|$|E
25|$|Lysozyme is {{an enzyme}} that is {{responsible}} for protecting the body by damaging bacterial cell walls. <b>Lactoferrin</b> is a globular, multifunctional protein that has antimicrobial activity. Compared to human milk, cow’s milk has a signifactly lower levels of lysozyme and lactoferrin; therefore, the industry has an increasing interest in adding them into infant formulas.|$|E
25|$|The c-ANCA antigen is {{specifically}} proteinase 3 (PR3). p-ANCA antigens include myeloperoxidase (MPO) and bacterial permeability increasing factor (BPI). Other antigens exist for c-ANCA (atypical), however many are as yet unknown. Classical p-ANCA occurs with antibodies directed to MPO. p-ANCA without nuclear extension occurs with antibodies to BPI, cathepsin G, elastase, <b>lactoferrin</b> and lysozyme. GS-ANA are antibodies directed to granulocyte specific nuclear antigens. Atypical ANCA {{are thought to}} be antigens {{similar to that of the}} p-ANCAs, however may occur due to differences in neutrophil processing.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{molecules}} from colostrum and cat milk, {{could also}} bear this coverage: <b>Lactoferrin,</b> Lactoperoxidase, Lysozyme, Rich Proline polypeptide—PRP and alpha-lactalbumine. <b>Lactoferrin</b> has many properties {{that make it}} a very good candidate for this anti-coronavirus activity: ...|$|E
2500|$|Iron {{is needed}} for {{bacterial}} growth making its bioavailability {{an important factor in}} controlling infection. Blood plasma as a result carries iron tightly bound to transferrin, which is taken up by cells by endocytosing transferrin, thus preventing its access to bacteria. Between 15 and 20 percent of the protein content in human milk consists of <b>lactoferrin</b> that binds iron. As a comparison, in cow's milk, this is only 2 percent. As a result, breast fed babies have fewer infections. <b>Lactoferrin</b> is also concentrated in tears, saliva and at wounds to bind iron to limit bacterial growth. [...] Egg white contains 12% conalbumin to withhold it from bacteria that get through the egg shell (for this reason, prior to antibiotics, egg white was used to treat infections).|$|E
2500|$|N. meningitidis {{is a part}} of {{the normal}} [...] flora in the {{nasopharynx}} of up to 5–15% of adults. It colonizes and infects only humans, and has never been isolated from other animals. This is thought to stem from the bacterium's inability to get iron sources other than human transferrin and <b>lactoferrin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|This {{can also}} be seen with {{pathogenic}} bacteria inside its host, where iron is bound tightly by haemoglobin, transferrin, <b>lactoferrin</b> and ferritin, and thus low in concentration (10−24 mol L−1). Here it secrets siderophores which has a higher affinity (with a formation constant, or (...) / (...) , of 1049)to Fe3+ than the host's iron-binding proteins, and so will remove iron and then transported inside the cell. Bacillus anthracis, a Gram-positive bacteria that causes anthrax, secretes two siderophores: bacillibactin and petrobactin.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{belief is}} that saliva {{contained}} in the mouth has natural disinfectants, which leads people to believe it is beneficial to [...] "lick their wounds". Researchers at the University of Florida at Gainesville have discovered a protein called nerve growth factor (NGF) in the saliva of mice. Wounds doused with NGF healed {{twice as fast as}} untreated and unlicked wounds; therefore, saliva can help to heal wounds in some species. NGF has not been found in human saliva; however, researchers find human saliva contains such antibacterial agents as secretory IgA, <b>lactoferrin,</b> lysozyme and peroxidase. It has not been shown that human licking of wounds disinfects them, but licking is likely to help clean the wound by removing [...] larger contaminants such as dirt and may help to directly remove infective bodies by brushing them away. Therefore, licking would be a way of wiping off pathogens, useful if clean water is not available to the animal or person.|$|E
2500|$|Their use has {{continued}} {{since the end}} of the Cold War in Georgia and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe. The first regulated, randomized, double-blind clinical trial was reported in the Journal of Wound Care in June 2009, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of a bacteriophage cocktail to treat infected venous leg ulcers in human patients. The FDA approved the study as a Phase I clinical trial. The study's results demonstrated the safety of therapeutic application of bacteriophages but did not show efficacy. The authors explain that the use of certain chemicals that are part of standard wound care (e.g. <b>lactoferrin</b> or silver) may have interfered with bacteriophage viability. Another controlled clinical trial in Western Europe (treatment of ear infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was reported shortly after in the journal Clinical Otolaryngology in August 2009. The study concludes that bacteriophage preparations were safe and effective for treatment of chronic ear infections in humans. Additionally, there have been numerous animal and other experimental clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of bacteriophages for various diseases, such as infected burns and wounds, and cystic fibrosis associated lung infections, among others. Meanwhile, bacteriophage researchers are developing engineered viruses to overcome antibiotic resistance, and engineering the phage genes responsible for coding enzymes which degrade the biofilm matrix, phage structural proteins and also enzymes responsible for lysis of bacterial cell wall. There have been results showing that T4 phages that are small in size and short-tailed can be helpful in detecting E.coli [...] in the human body.|$|E
2500|$|Newborns {{have very}} {{immature}} and small [...] digestive systems, and colostrum delivers its nutrients {{in a very}} concentrated low-volume form. It has a mild laxative effect, encouraging {{the passing of the}} baby's first stool, which is called meconium. [...] This clears excess bilirubin, a waste-product of dead red blood cells, which is produced in large quantities at birth due to blood volume reduction from the infant's body and helps prevent jaundice. Colostrum is known to contain immune cells (as lymphocytes) and many antibodies such as IgA, [...] IgG, and IgM. [...] These are some of the components of the adaptive immune system. [...] In preterm infants some IgA may be absorbed through the intestinal epithelium and enter the blood stream though there is very little uptake in full term babies. [...] This is due to the early [...] "closure" [...] of the intestinal epithelium to large molecule uptake in humans unlike the case in cattle which continue to uptake immunoglobulin from milk shortly after birth. [...] Other immune components of colostrum include the major components of the innate immune system, such as <b>lactoferrin,</b> lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, complement, and proline-rich polypeptides (PRP). A number of cytokines (small messenger peptides that control the functioning of the immune system) are found in colostrum as well, including interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, chemokines, and others. Colostrum also contains a number of growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factors I (IGF-1), and II, transforming growth factors alpha, beta 1 and beta 2, fibroblast growth factors, epidermal growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage-stimulating growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and colony-stimulating factor-1.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{suggested}} that the oligomer state of <b>lactoferrin</b> is determined by its concentration and that polymerization of <b>lactoferrin</b> is strongly affected {{by the presence of}} Ca2+ ions. In particular, monomers were dominant at concentrations below 10−10−10−11 M in the presence of Ca2+, but they converted into tetramers at <b>lactoferrin</b> concentrations above 10−9−10−10 M. Titer of <b>lactoferrin</b> in the blood corresponds to this particular [...] "transition concentration" [...] and thus <b>lactoferrin</b> in the blood should be presented both as a monomer and tetramer. Many functional properties of <b>lactoferrin</b> depend on its oligomeric state. In particular, monomeric, but not tetrameric <b>lactoferrin</b> can strongly bind to DNA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lactoferrin</b> {{prevents}} the attachment of H. pylori in the stomach, which in turn, aids in reducing digestive system disorders. Bovine <b>lactoferrin</b> has more activity against H. pylori than human <b>lactoferrin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{human lung}} and saliva contain {{a wide range}} of {{antimicrobial}} compound including lactoperoxidase system, producing hypothiocyanite and <b>lactoferrin,</b> with hypothiocyanite missing in cystic fibrosis patients. <b>Lactoferrin,</b> a component of innate immunity, prevents bacterial biofilm development. The loss of microbicidal activity and increased formation of biofilm due to decreased <b>lactoferrin</b> activity is observed in patients with cystic fibrosis. In cystic fibrosis, antibiotic susceptibility may be modified by <b>lactoferrin</b> These findings demonstrate the important role of <b>lactoferrin</b> in human host defense and especially in lung. <b>Lactoferrin</b> with hypothiocyanite has been granted orphan drug status by the EMEA and the FDA.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>lactoferrin</b> {{also has}} other {{antibacterial}} mechanisms {{not related to}} iron, such as stimulation of phagocytosis, the interaction with the outer bacterial membrane described above is the most dominant and most studied. <b>Lactoferrin</b> not only disrupts the membrane, but even penetrates into the cell. Its binding to the bacteria wall {{is associated with the}} specific peptide lactoferricin, which is located at the N-lobe of <b>lactoferrin</b> and is produced by in vitro cleavage of <b>lactoferrin</b> with another protein, trypsin. A mechanism of the antimicrobial action of <b>lactoferrin</b> has been reported as <b>lactoferrin</b> targets H+-ATPase and interferes with proton translocation in the cell membrane, resulting in a lethal effect in vitro.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lactoferrin</b> forms reddish complex with iron; its {{affinity}} for iron is 300 {{times higher than}} that of transferrin. The affinity increases in weakly acidic medium. This facilitates the transfer of iron from transferrin to <b>lactoferrin</b> during inflammations, when the pH of tissues decreases due to accumulation of lactic and other acids. The saturated iron concentration in <b>lactoferrin</b> in human milk is estimated as 10 to 30% (100% corresponds to all <b>lactoferrin</b> molecules containing 2 iron atoms). It is demonstrated that <b>lactoferrin</b> is involved not only in the transport of iron, zinc and copper, but also in the regulation of their intake. Presence of loose ions of zinc and copper does not affect the iron binding ability of <b>lactoferrin,</b> and might even increase it.|$|E
50|$|Administration of <b>lactoferrin</b> through {{drinking}} water to mice with weakened immune systems {{and symptoms of}} aphthous ulcer {{reduced the number of}} Candida albicans strains in the mouth {{and the size of the}} damaged areas in the tongue. Oral administration of <b>lactoferrin</b> to animals also reduced the number of pathogenic organisms in the tissues close to the gastrointestinal tract. Candida albicans could also be completely eradicated with a mixture containing <b>lactoferrin,</b> lysozyme and itraconazole in HIV-positive patients who were resistant to other antifungal drugs. Such antifungal action when other drugs deem inefficient is characteristic of <b>lactoferrin</b> and is especially valuable for HIV-infected patients. Contrary to the antiviral and antibacterial actions of <b>lactoferrin,</b> very little is known about the mechanism of its antifungal action. <b>Lactoferrin</b> seems to bind the plasma membrane of C. albicans inducing an apoptotic-like process.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lactoferrin</b> {{receptor}} {{plays an}} important role in the internalization of lactoferrin; it also facilitates absorption of iron ions by <b>lactoferrin.</b> It was shown that gene expression increases with age in the duodenum and decreases in the jejunum.The moonlighting glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has been demonstrated to function as a receptor for <b>lactoferrin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Lactoferrin</b> (LF), {{also known}} as lactotransferrin (LTF), is a {{multifunctional}} protein of the transferrin family. <b>Lactoferrin</b> is a globular glycoprotein with a molecular mass of about 80 kDa that is widely represented in various secretory fluids, such as milk, saliva, tears, and nasal secretions. <b>Lactoferrin</b> is also present in secondary granules of PMN and is secreted by some acinar cells. <b>Lactoferrin</b> can be purified from milk or produced recombinantly. Human colostrum ("first milk") has the highest concentration, followed by human milk, then cow milk (150 mg/L).|$|E
50|$|<b>Lactoferrin</b> {{is one of}} the {{components}} of the immune system of the body; it has antimicrobial activity (bacteriocide, fungicide) and is part of the innate defense, mainly at mucoses. In particular, <b>lactoferrin</b> provides antibacterial activity to human infants. <b>Lactoferrin</b> interacts with DNA and RNA, polysaccharides and heparin, and shows some of its biological functions in complexes with these ligands.|$|E
50|$|Both {{in blood}} plasma and in {{secretory}} fluids <b>lactoferrin</b> can exist in different polymeric forms ranging from monomers to tetramers. <b>Lactoferrin</b> tends to polymerize both in vitro and in vivo, especially at high concentrations. Several authors {{found that the}} dominant form of <b>lactoferrin</b> in physiological conditions is a tetramer, with the monomer:tetramer ratio of 1:4 at the protein concentrations of 10−5 M.|$|E
50|$|Intelectin-1, {{also known}} as omentin or {{intestinal}} <b>lactoferrin</b> receptor, is an intelectin encoded in humans by the ITLN1 gene. Intelectin-1 functions both as a receptor for bacterial arabinogalactans and for <b>lactoferrin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Lactoferrin</b> {{belongs to}} the innate immune system. Apart from its main {{biological}} function, namely binding and transport of iron ions, <b>lactoferrin</b> also has antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic, catalytic, anti-cancer, and anti-allergic functions and properties.|$|E
50|$|Lactoferrin's {{primary role}} is to {{sequester}} free iron, {{and in doing so}} remove essential substrate required for bacterial growth. Antibacterial action of <b>lactoferrin</b> is also explained by the presence of specific receptors on the cell surface of microorganisms. <b>Lactoferrin</b> binds to lipopolysaccharide of bacterial walls, and the oxidized iron part of the <b>lactoferrin</b> oxidizes bacteria via formation of peroxides. This affects the membrane permeability and results in the cell breakdown (lysis).|$|E
50|$|One of the {{important}} properties of <b>lactoferrin</b> {{is its ability to}} bind with nucleic acids. The fraction of protein extracted from milk, contains 3.3% RNA,besides, the protein preferably binds to the double-stranded than to the single-stranded DNA. The ability of <b>lactoferrin</b> to bind DNA is used for the isolation and purification of <b>lactoferrin</b> using affinity chromatography with columns containing immobilized DNA-containing sorbents, such as agarose with the immobilized single-stranded DNA.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{molecules}} from colostrum and cat milk, {{could also}} bear this coverage: <b>Lactoferrin,</b> Lactoperoxidase, Lysozyme, Rich Proline polypeptide—PRP and alpha-lactalbumine. <b>Lactoferrin</b> has many properties {{that make it}} a very good candidate for this anti-coronavirus activity: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Lactoferrin</b> and lactoferricin inhibit {{in vitro}} growth of Trichophyton mentagrophytes, which are {{responsible}} for several skin diseases such as ringworm. <b>Lactoferrin</b> also acts against the Candida albicans - a diploid fungus (a form of yeast) that causes opportunistic oral and genital infections in humans. Fluconazole has long been used against Candida albicans, which resulted in emergence of strains resistant to this drug. However, a combination of <b>lactoferrin</b> with fluconazole can act against fluconazole-resistant strains of Candida albicans {{as well as other}} types of Candida: C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis. Antifungal activity is observed for sequential incubation of Candida with <b>lactoferrin</b> and then with fluconazole, but not vice versa. The antifungal activity of lactoferricin exceeds that of <b>lactoferrin.</b> In particular, synthetic peptide 1-11 lactoferricin shows much greater activity against Candida albicans than native lactoferricin.|$|E
50|$|In humans, <b>lactoferrin</b> gene LTF {{is located}} on the third {{chromosome}} in the locus 3q21-q23. In oxen, the coding sequence consists of 17 exons and has a length of about 34,500 nucleotide pairs. Exons of the <b>lactoferrin</b> gene in oxen have a similar size to the exons of other genes of the transferrin family, whereas the sizes of introns differ within the family. Similarity in the size of exons and their distribution in the domains of the protein molecule indicates that the evolutionary development of <b>lactoferrin</b> gene occurred by duplication. Study of polymorphism of genes that encode <b>lactoferrin</b> helps selecting livestock breeds that are resistant to mastitis.|$|E
