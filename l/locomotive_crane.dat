The total weight of steel in the span is 1,803 tons. Only a little riveting was done until after Dec. 20, 1920, when over 90 per cent of the span was in place, but the work was then pushed until completion on Feb. 9, 1921, during which time temperatures ranged from —42 to -(-34 deg. F. On some cold and windy days the riveters did not work; but on one occasion rivets were driven when it was —42 deg. in the morning and —12 deg. at quitting time. Rivets driven during very low temperatures were retested several times later in warmer weather and showed first class work. The total number of field rivets was about 42,200.|$|E

50|$|North London Railway (NLR) Crane Tank was a 0-4-2ST steam <b>locomotive</b> <b>crane</b> tank type. Originally {{built in}} 1858 as a Sharp-Stewart 0-4-0ST, it was rebuilt into an 0-4-2ST with a steam crane {{carried by the}} {{trailing}} truck in 1872. NLR Number 29A; it was subsequently inherited by the LNWR in 1908, who gave it the number 2896, in turn the LMS in 1923 (No. 7217, later placed on duplicate list as 27217), and British Railways in 1948 (BR No. 58865). It was the oldest locomotive to be inherited by BR. And when finally withdrawn in 1951, it was the oldest surviving standard gauge engine in service with British Railways. It was scrapped at Derby Works.|$|E
5000|$|In 1917, {{as part of}} the World War I effort, the US {{government}} contracted American International Shipbuilding {{to build}} ships and a shipyard at Hog Island. At the time Hog Island was the largest shipyard in the world, with 50 slipways. The first ship (named [...] for the Lenape name for the site) was christened August 5, 1918, by Edith Bolling Wilson, wife of US president Woodrow Wilson. The shipbuilding process practiced on Hog Island was an early experiment in standardized construction of ships. The ships built there, known as [...] "Hog Islanders", were considered ugly but well built. In all, 122 Hog Islanders were built, mostly cargo ships, and a few troop transport ships. The shipbuilding continued until 1921, after which the facility was rapidly demolished. None of the ships were ready in time to participate in World War I, but many of them were involved in World War II. Two of the locomotive steam gantry cranes were sold as surplus to the city of Trenton, New Jersey, where they remain today as the Hog Island Cranes, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Another crane, a 20-ton Industrial <b>locomotive</b> <b>crane,</b> was sold to the Hyde, McFarlan & Burke contracting company.|$|E

40|$|Generally, DC motors {{are given}} {{preference}} for industrial {{applications such as}} electric <b>locomotives,</b> <b>cranes,</b> goods lifts. Because of they have high starting moment; they initially start with high current. This high start-up current must be decreased since it may damage windings of the motor and increases power consumption. It could be controlled by an appropriate driver system and controller. The nature of fuzzy logic control has adaptive characteristics that can achieve robust response to a system with uncertainty, parameter variation, and load disturbance. In this paper, fuzzy logic based control of start-up current of a Buck-Boost Converter fed serial DC motor is examined through computer simulation. In order to see the advantages of fuzzy logic control, classical PI control has applied to the same motor, under same circumstances and has been compared. C++ Builder software {{has been used for}} the simulation. According to the simulation results, plainly, fuzzy logic control has stronger responses than classical PI control and uses lower current at starting moment...|$|R

50|$|A similar system, {{usually called}} a dead man's switch (for other names, see {{alternative}} names), {{as its name}} suggests, is a device intended to stop a machine (or activate one) if the human operator becomes incapacitated, and {{is a form of}} fail-safe. They are commonly used in industrial applications (e.g., <b>locomotives,</b> tower <b>cranes,</b> freight elevators) and consumer applications (e.g., lawn mowers, tractors, jet skis, outboard motors, snowblowers, motorcycles and snowmobiles). The switch in these cases is held by the user, and turns off the machine if they let go. Some riding lawnmowers have a kill switch in the seat which stops the engine and blade if the operator's weight is no longer on the seat.|$|R
50|$|In 1856 the South Australian Railways ordered two 2-4-0 tender {{locomotives}} from Robert Stephenson and Company, {{the first}} arriving in November 1856 {{and the second}} in March 1858. They entered service on the Gawler and Outer Harbor lines. In 1875 both were rebuilt as 2-4-0T tank engines. In 1887, number 7 was rebuilt by Islington Railway Workshops as a <b>crane</b> <b>locomotive</b> with number 4 following in 1893. Both were withdrawn and scrapped in the 1930s.|$|R

The two cranes now in Trenton were sold as government surplus in 1930 to the city of Trenton for $5000, a fifth of the original cost, and were installed at the Trenton Marine Terminal in 1932.|$|R
50|$|The third {{engine was}} also built in 1893, {{and was the}} first {{locomotive}} built by the new enlarged railway workshops at Newport. It was numbered 526 and despite bearing little resemblance to the two Phoenix motors it was also classified Z, perhaps because no more letters were available except I which would have been avoided because it resembled 1. In 1903 it was rebuilt as a <b>crane</b> <b>locomotive</b> as No. 3 Steam Crane. After spending many years that the South Dynon Locomotive Depot, Z 526 was withdrawn in June 1978, and between 1980 and 1985 the locomotive was restored at Newport Workshops to its 1893 side tank configuration, and was donated to Museum Victoria in 1992.|$|R
5000|$|The Port of New York {{was really}} eleven ports in one. It boasted a {{developed}} shoreline of over 650 mi comprising the waterfronts of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island {{as well as}} the New Jersey shoreline from Perth Amboy to Elizabeth, Bayonne, Newark, Jersey City, Hoboken and Weehawken. The Port of New York included some 1,800 docks, piers, and wharves of every conceivable size, condition, and state of repair. Some 750 were classified as [...] "active" [...] and 200 were able to berth 425 ocean-going vessels simultaneously in addition to the 600 able to anchor in the harbor. These docks and piers gave access to 1,100 warehouses containing some 41000000 sq ft of inclosed storage space. In addition, the Port of New York had thirty-nine active shipyards, not including the huge New York Naval Shipyard on the Brooklyn side of the East River. These facilities included nine big ship repair yards, thirty-six large dry-docks, twenty-five small shipyards, thirty-three <b>locomotive</b> and gantry <b>cranes</b> of fifty ton lift capacity or greater, five floating derricks, and more than one hundred tractor cranes. Over 575 tugboats worked the Port of New York.|$|R
5000|$|Baldwin Locomotive Works {{delivered}} five 14"/50 caliber railway guns on trains for the United States Navy during April and May 1918. Each 14"/50 gun [...] {{mounted on}} a 72 ft, 535000 lb rail carriage with four 6-wheel bogies was {{under the command of}} a United States Navy lieutenant with a standard U.S. Army 2-8-0 <b>locomotive,</b> a 10-ton <b>crane</b> car, two armored ammunition cars carrying 25 shells each, two cars carrying the recoil pit foundation materials, two fuel and workshop cars, three berthing cars, a kitchen car, a commissary car, and a medical dispensary car. A sixth locomotive pulled a headquarters car for Rear Admiral Charles Peshall Plunkett, with a machine-shop car, a spare parts car, a berthing car, a kitchen car, a commissary car, and a medical dispensary car. After delivery by ship, these trains were assembled in St. Nazaire in August and fired a total of 782 shells during 25 days on the Western Front at ranges between 27 and 36 km. Each 14 in projectile weighed 1400 lb and was fired at 2800 ft per second. The railway carriages could elevate the guns to 43 degrees, but elevations over 15 degrees required excavation of a pit with room for the gun to recoil and structural steel shoring foundations to prevent caving of the pit sides from recoil forces absorbed by the surrounding soil. The trains moved cautiously because axle loading under the gun barrels was 50330 lb while French railways were designed for a maximum of 39000 lb. These axle journals overheated at speeds of more than 10 km per hour. After reaching its intended firing site and constructing the recoil pit, each gun could fire about two shells per hour. One of these guns was retained after the war as an ammunition test gun at the Dahlgren Weapons Laboratory until all United States battleships with 14"/50 guns were scrapped shortly after World War II. The gun was then placed on display outside the museum at the Washington Navy Yard.|$|R
