5|$|Enzymes with single-substrate {{mechanisms}} include isomerases such as triosephosphateisomerase or bisphosphoglycerate mutase, intramolecular lyases such as {{adenylate cyclase}} and the hammerhead ribozyme, an RNA <b>lyase.</b> However, some enzymes that {{only have a}} single substrate do not fall into this category of mechanisms. Catalase {{is an example of}} this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of hydrogen peroxide substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping–pong mechanism, a type of mechanism that is discussed in the Multi-substrate reactions section below.|$|E

25|$|The general biosynthetic pathway of {{capsaicin}} {{and other}} capsaicinoids was elucidated in the 1960s by Bennett and Kirby, and Leete and Louden. Radiolabeling studies identified phenylalanine and valine as the precursors to capsaicin. Enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia <b>lyase</b> (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) and their function in capsaicinoid biosynthesis were identified later by Fujiwake et al., and Sukrasno and Yeoman. Suzuki et al. {{are responsible for}} identifying leucine as another precursor to the branched-chain fatty acid pathway. It was discovered in 1999 that pungency of chili peppers is related to higher transcription levels of key enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia <b>lyase,</b> cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase. Similar studies showed high transcription levels in the placenta of chili peppers with high pungency of genes responsible for branched-chain fatty acid pathway.|$|E
25|$|The hydroxylase {{reactions}} {{are part of}} the synthetic pathway to cortisol as well as sex steroids, but the <b>lyase</b> reaction is only necessary for sex steroid synthesis. Different alleles of the CYP17A1 gene result in enzyme molecules with a range of impaired or reduced function that produces a range of clinical problems.|$|E
25|$|Arginine is {{synthesized}} from citrulline in arginine and proline metabolism by the sequential {{action of}} the cytosolic enzymes argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and argininosuccinate <b>lyase</b> (ASL). This is an energetically costly process, because for each molecule of argininosuccinate that is synthesized, one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), consuming two ATP equivalents.|$|E
40|$|Alginate <b>lyases</b> {{catalyze}} {{the degradation}} of alginate, a complex copolymer of alpha-L-guluronate and its C 5 epimer beta-D-mannuronate. The enzymes have been isolated from various kinds of organisms with different substrate specificities, including algae, marine mollusks, marine and terrestrial bacteria, and some viruses and fungi. With the progress of structural biology, many kinds of alginate <b>lyases</b> of different polysaccharide <b>lyases</b> families have been characterized by obtaining crystal structures, and the catalytic mechanism has also been elucidated. Combined with various studies, we summarized the source, classification and properties of the alginate <b>lyases</b> from different polysaccharide <b>lyases</b> families.

50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of <b>lyases,</b> to be specific, those carbon-oxygen <b>lyases</b> acting on phosphates. The {{systematic}} name of this enzyme class is 6-(1S,2R)-1,2-dihydroxy-3-triphosphooxypropyl-7,8-dihydropterin triphosphate-lyase (6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin-forming).|$|R

25|$|A seventh {{catalytic}} type of proteolytic enzymes, asparagine peptide <b>lyase,</b> {{was described}} in 2011. Its proteolytic mechanism is unusual since, rather than hydrolysis, it performs an elimination reaction. During this reaction, the catalytic asparagine forms a cyclic chemical structure that cleaves itself at asparagine residues in proteins under the right conditions. Given its fundamentally different mechanism, its inclusion as a peptidase may be debatable.|$|E
25|$|Commercially {{used since}} 1998, iminodisuccinic (IDS) acid biodegrades about 80% after only 7 days. IDS binds to calcium {{exceptionally}} well and forms stable compounds with other heavy metal ions. In {{addition to having}} a lower toxicity after chelation, the production of IDS is environment-friendly. Specifically, IDS is degraded {{through the use of}} IDS-epimerase and C–N <b>lyase</b> found in Agrobacterium tumefaciens (BY6) which can be harvested on a large scale. Additionally, the reactions catalyzed by both enzymes do not require any cofactors and can thus be applied directly.|$|E
25|$|BPA {{has been}} found to bind to both of the nuclear {{estrogen}} receptors (ERs), ERα and ERβ. It is 1000- to 2000-fold less potent than estradiol. The drug can both mimic the action of estrogen and antagonize estrogen, indicating that it is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) or partial agonist of the ER. At high concentrations, BPA also binds to and acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR). In addition to receptor binding, the compound {{has been found}} to affect Leydig cell steroidogenesis, including affecting 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 <b>lyase</b> and aromatase expression and interfering with LH receptor-ligand binding.|$|E

25|$|Prenylcysteine <b>lyase</b> (PCLase) catalyzes the {{cleavage}} of prenylcysteine (a protein modification) {{to form an}} isoprenoid aldehyde and the freed cysteine residue on {{the protein}} target. The FAD is non-covalently bound to PCLase. Not many mechanistic {{studies have been done}} looking at the reactions of the flavin, but the proposed mechanism is shown below. It is proposed that there is a hydride transfer from the C1 of the prenyl moiety to FAD that results in the reduction of the flavin to FADH2 and the formation of a carbocation that is stabilized by the neighboring sulfur atom. FADH2 then reacts with molecular oxygen to restore the oxidized enzyme.|$|E
25|$|A {{new class}} of {{fluorescent}} protein was evolved from a cyanobacterial (Trichodesmium erythraeum) phycobiliprotein, α-allophycocyanin, and named small ultra red fluorescent protein (smURFP) in 2016. smURFP autocatalytically self-incorporates the chromophore biliverdin without the need of an external protein, known as a <b>lyase.</b> Jellyfish- and coral-derived fluorescent proteins require oxygen and produce a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide upon chromophore formation. smURFP does not require oxygen or produce hydrogen peroxide and uses the chromophore biliverdin. smURFP has a large extinction coefficient (180,000 M−1 cm−1) and has a modest quantum yield (0.20), which makes it comparable biophysical brightness to eGFP and ~2-fold brighter than most red or far-red fluorescent proteins derived from coral. smURFP spectral properties {{are similar to the}} organic dye Cy5.|$|E
25|$|The {{pyruvate}} {{produced by}} glycolysis {{is an important}} intermediary in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids and cholesterol. This occurs via the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. However, this acetyl CoA needs to be transported into cytosol where the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol occurs. This cannot occur directly. To obtain cytosolic acetyl-CoA, citrate (produced by the condensation of acetyl CoA with oxaloacetate) {{is removed from the}} citric acid cycle and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. There it is cleaved by ATP citrate <b>lyase</b> into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate can be used for gluconeogenesis (in the liver), or it can be returned into mitochondrion as malate. The cytosolic acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by acetyl CoA carboxylase into malonyl CoA, the first committed step in the synthesis of fatty acids.|$|E

30|$|Alginate <b>lyases</b> are {{important}} and indispensable tools for production of AOs with special bioactivities (Wong et al. 2000; Zhu and Yin 2015). However, there are almost no commercialized alginate <b>lyases</b> with low cost and high yield until now. The narrow substrate specificity and low enzyme activity of existing enzymes still limit the industrial production of alginate oligosaccharides (Dou et al. 2013). Therefore, {{it is essential to}} continuously search and identify novel alginate <b>lyases</b> with high enzyme activity and wide substrate specificity from different sources. Nowadays, hundreds of alginate <b>lyases</b> have been isolated and identified from algae, marine mollusks and many kinds of microorganisms (Kawamoto et al. 2006; Matsubara et al. 2000; Zhu et al. 2015 b, 2016 a, b). Especially, different microorganisms have been reported to degrade alginate and become the most important sources of alginate <b>lyases.</b>|$|R

40|$|Hydroxynitrile <b>lyases</b> are a {{versatile}} group of enzymes that are applied {{both in the}} laboratory and on an industrial scale. What makes them particularly interesting is that to date five structurally unrelated categories of hydroxynitrile <b>lyases</b> have been discovered. Given their great importance they have often been immobilised utilising many different methodologies. Therefore the hydroxynitrile <b>lyases</b> are ideally suited to compare different immobilisation methods and their dependence on the structural features of the enzyme in question, since the activity is the same in all cases. This review examines all the different immobilisation methods applied to hydroxynitrile <b>lyases</b> and draws conclusions {{on the effect of}} the approach. BiotechnologyApplied Science...|$|R
2500|$|The {{choice between}} short- and long-patch repair is {{currently}} under investigation. [...] Various factors {{are thought to}} influence this decision, including the type of lesion, the cell cycle stage, and whether the cell is terminally differentiated or actively dividing. [...] Some lesions, such as oxidized or reduced AP sites, are resistant to pol β <b>lyase</b> activity and, therefore, must be processed by long-patch BER.|$|E
2500|$|A {{very small}} number of people have {{reportedly}} had an abnormal allele that resulted primarily in a reduction of 17,20-lyase activity, rather than both the hydroxylase and <b>lyase</b> activities as described above. In these people the defect had the effect of an isolated impairment of sex steroid (e.g., DHEA in the adrenal, but also gonadal testosterone and estrogens) synthesis, whereas mineralocorticoid (e.g., aldosterone) and glucocorticoid (e.g., cortisol) levels remain normal.|$|E
2500|$|Pathway {{preference}} {{may differ}} between organisms, as well. [...] While human cells utilize both short- and long-patch BER, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was long thought to lack a short-patch pathway {{because it does}} not have homologs of several mammalian short-patch proteins, including pol β, DNA ligase III, XRCC1, and the kinase domain of PNKP. [...] The recent discovery that the poly-A polymerase Trf4 possesses 5' dRP <b>lyase</b> activity has challenged this view.|$|E
