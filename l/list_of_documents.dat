Our approach is based on the Hedge algorithm for on-line learning. In effect, our proposed system “learns ” which documents are likely to be relevant from a sequence of on-line relevance judgments. In experiments using TREC data, our methodology is shown to outperform standard methods for metasearch, pooling, and system evaluation, often remarkably so...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Metasearch and data-fusion {{techniques}} {{combine the}} rank <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> multiple <b>document</b> retrieval systems {{with the aim}} of improving search coverage and precision. We propose a new fusion method that partitions the rank <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>document</b> retrieval systems into chunks. The size of chunks grows exponentially in the rank list. Using a small number of training queries, the probabilities <b>of</b> relevance <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> in different chunks are approximated for each search system. The estimated probabilities and normalized document scores are used to compute the final document ranks in the merged list. We show that our proposed method produces higher average precision values than previous systems across a range of testbeds. ...|$|R
