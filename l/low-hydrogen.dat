5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or <b>low-hydrogen</b> electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking.

40|$|International audienceTo {{provide new}} {{insight into the}} dark {{fermentation}} process, a multi-lateral study was performed to study the microbiology of 20 different lab-scale bioreactors operated in four different countries (Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay). Samples (29) were collected from bioreactors with different configurations, operation conditions, and performances. The microbial communities were analyzed using 16 S rRNA genes 454 pyrosequencing. The results showed notably uneven communities with a high predominance of a particular genus. The phylum Firmicutes predominated {{in most of the}} samples, but the phyla Thermotogae or Proteobacteria dominated in a few samples. Genera from three physiological groups were detected: high-yield hydrogen producers (Clostridium, Kosmotoga, Enterobacter), fermenters with <b>low-hydrogen</b> yield (mostly from Veillonelaceae), and competitors (Lactobacillus). Inocula, reactor configurations, and substrates influence the microbial communities. This is the first joint effort that evaluates hydrogen-producing reactors and operational conditions from different countries and contributes to understand the dark fermentation process...|$|E
40|$|Optical, {{structural}} and thermodynamic properties of Y/Mg–Hx multilayered switchable mirrors are investigated and compared with YMgHx-alloys and pure YHx. Multilayers clearly have superior reflectance in the <b>low-hydrogen</b> state {{over the whole}} range of photon energies, 0. 72 <hω< 3. 5 eV, investigated in this work. In the transparent high-hydrogen state the absorption edge of the multilayers with the same overall composition is shifted in energy on increasing the individual layer thicknesses. Thus, the absorption edge is non-trivially depending on the distribution of Mg in the film. Moreover, the optical contrast of multilayers is much higher than for pure YHx and their optical switching does not suffer from hysteretic effects. Finally, Mg and YH 2 transform almost {{at the same time to}} MgH 2 and YH 3, respectively, with a heat of formation of − 30. 9 kJ/mol H in absorption and − 36. 6 kJ/mol H in desorption...|$|E
40|$|Continuing the {{previous}} report(N 0. 1) ，we want to report here {{the results of}} some experiments on the variation of the maximum arc length under various blowing directions {{and the influence of}} the wind to the vaporized coating of electrodes. 　　An outline of the results will be described below. 　　(1) The maximum arc length is affected remarkably by the coating of electrode. The　arc　length　of　an　ilumenite　electrode　is　longer　than　that　of　a　<b>low-hydrogen</b> electrode. It is observed that the vaporized coating， i. e. gas molecules， is　more　effective on striking　the arc　than　the　vaporized　core metal and moreover　the former depends strongly on t he winds 2 ̆ 7 conditions. 　　(2) The maximum arc length is affected by the blowing directions. 　In the opposite blowing {{it is going to be}} the shortest and in the backward blowing， inclined at 45 °，it is going to be the longest. 　　(3) The relation of L(θ) /L(π/ 2) and θ or the variation of the arc angle is independent of the kind of electrode and the blowing direction. 　　(4) The arc voltage at a moment of arc-vanishing depends on the blowing direction but the current is not so much affected. 　　(5) These results suggest that the interaction of the wind and the gas ionic flow of the coating will be a subject for a next study...|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} of {{comprehensive}} re-design of an {{arrayed waveguide grating}} (AWG) -based integrated photonic spectrograph (IPS), using Silica-on-Silicon (SOS) technology, to tailor specific performance parameters of interest to high-resolution (resolving power, R = lambda/Delta. lambda = 60, 000) exoplanet astronomy and stellar seismology. The compactness, modularity, stability, replicability and small-lightweight-payload of the IPS are a few promising and innovative features {{in the design of}} high-resolution spectrographs for astronomy or other areas of sciences. The IPS is designed to resolve up to 646 spectral lines per spectral order, with a wavelength spacing of 25 pm, at a central wavelength of 1630 nm (Hband). The fabricated test waveguides have been stress engineered in order to compensate the inherent birefringence of SOS waveguides. The birefringence values of fabricated test structures were quantified, to be on the order 10 - 6 (theoretical value required to avoid the formation of ghost-images), through inscription of Bragg-gratings on straight waveguides and subsequent measurement of Bragg-reflection spectra. An interferometer system has been integrated with the SOS-IPS (in the same chip) for the characterization of phase errors of the waveguide array. Moreover, promising results of first fabricated key photonics components to form other complex integrated photonic circuits (IPCs), such as astro-interferometers, using silicon nitride-on-insulator (SNOI) technology are also presented. The fabricated IPCs include multimode interference based devices (power splitter/combiners, optical cross/bar-switches), directional-couplers with varying power ratios, Mach-Zehnder interferometers and an AWG. The first results of annealed, <b>low-hydrogen</b> SNOI based devices are promising and comparable to SOI and commercial devices, with device excess-loss less than 2 dB and under 1 dB/cm waveguide-loss in the IR-wavelength...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Welding on {{in-service}} pipelines (hot tapping) {{has been}} prac-ticed {{for many years}} on pipes containing both liquids and gases. The increasing frequency of sour conditions within gas and oil pipelines increases the risks in-volved in welding on pressure-contain-ing lines and imposes additional re-straints {{in the form of}} maximum tolerable hardness, especially in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). While there are existing pro-cedures to deal with the cooling rate ef-fects of the liquid or gas contained within a pipeline, little is known {{of the effects of the}} physical properties of the liquid or gas on the cooling rates to be expected. Most experimental work on procedure verification has been done on still or cir-culating water as the working fluid. In this study, a pressurized test coupon of X- 52 -type pipe was filled with liquids of differing physical properties — water, ethylene glycol, methanol, water-glycol mixtures and water-methanol mixtures. Thermocouples monitored inside wall-temperature changes caused by mecha-nized GTAW autogenous fusion runs on the pipe surface, and optical pyrometer measurements were used to assess out-side wall temperature cycles. The results show both the working fluid physical properties and the pipe pressure conditions affect the weld zone cooling rate to a significant degree. It is possible to control cooling rates on the inside and outside walls of the pipe by adjusting working fluid properties and in-ternal pressure conditions. <b>Low-hydrogen</b> SMAW deposits were compared to the autogenous GTAW runs for limited but practical repair procedural conditions. This showed the expected heat input increase due to more efficient SMAW arc conditions is about 25 %. This difference is somewhat lower than the usual GTAW/SMAW arc efficiency com-parisons in the literature. It indicates the necessity for more trials incorporating the range of welding process parameters to be considered in evaluating the work-ing fluid cooling characteristics. Once the heat input relationships for various processes are established, the cooling rate control possible with various working fluid compositions can be uti-lized to assess procedure qualification in a controlled engineering environment. A procedure qualification involving the modified water-ethylene glycol working fluid has been used to make a nozzle to pipe weld on an active sour gas pipeline during the Canadian winter...|$|E
