50|$|One {{consequence}} of the FHLBB's lack of enforcement abilities was the promotion of deregulation and aggressive, expanded lending to forestall insolvency. In November 1980, the FHLBB <b>lowered</b> <b>net</b> worth requirements for federally insured S&Ls from 5% of deposits to 4%. The FHLBB <b>lowered</b> <b>net</b> worth requirements again to 3% in January 1982. Additionally, the agency only required S&Ls to meet these requirements over a 20-year period. The rule meant that S&Ls less than 20 years old had practically no capital reserve requirements. That encouraged extensive chartering of new S&Ls because a $2 million investment could be leveraged into $1.3 billion in lending.|$|R

25|$|FIFO {{treats the}} first unit that arrived in {{inventory}} {{as the first}} one sold. LIFO considers the last unit arriving in inventory as the first one sold. Which method an accountant selects can {{have a significant effect}} on net income and book value and, in turn, on taxation. Using LIFO accounting for inventory, a company generally reports <b>lower</b> <b>net</b> income and lower book value, due to the effects of inflation. This generally results in lower taxation. Due to LIFO's potential to skew inventory value, UK GAAP and IAS have effectively banned LIFO inventory accounting. LIFO accounting is permitted in the United States subject to section 472 of the Internal Revenue Code.|$|E
25|$|In reverse {{swing the}} seam is angled {{in the same}} way as in {{conventional}} swing (10–20 degrees to one side) but the boundary layer on both sides is turbulent. The net effect of the seam and rough side is that the ball swings in the direction opposite to where the seam is pointing to. The turbulent boundary layer separating later is similar to the effect produced by dimples in a golf ball. In case of the golf ball, turbulence is produced on both sides of the ball and the net effect is a later separation of boundary layer on both sides and smaller wake in the back of the ball and a <b>lower</b> <b>net</b> drag due to pressure differential between the front and the back – this enables the golf ball to travel farther.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that fair trade farmers get higher prices on average. Anecdotes state that farmers were paid more or less by traders than by Fairtrade cooperatives. Few of these anecdotes address the problems of price reporting in developing world markets, and few appreciate the complexity of the different price packages {{which may or may not}} include credit, harvesting, transport, processing, etc. Cooperatives typically average prices over the year, so they pay less than traders at some times, more at others. Bassett (2009) is able to compare prices only where Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade farmers have to sell cotton to the same monopsonistic ginneries which pay low prices. Prices would have to be higher to compensate farmers for the increased costs they incur to produce Fairtrade. For instance, Fairtrade encouraged Nicaraguan farmers to switch to organic coffee, which resulted in a higher price per pound, but a <b>lower</b> <b>net</b> income because of higher costs and lower yields.|$|E

500|$|Between 1858 and 1873 {{several people}} in Victorian England experimented with a lawn version of tennis.

Wingfield is widely credited with popularising the new game through his energetic promotional efforts. The Sphairistikè court was hourglass-shaped, wider at the baseline than at the net. The service was made from a single side in a lozenge shaped box situated {{in the middle of the}} court and it had to bounce beyond the service line.
