25|$|Antihistamines are {{effective}} at treating mild cases of pollinosis, {{this type of}} non-prescribed drugs includes <b>loratadine,</b> cetirizine and chlorpheniramine. They do not prevent the discharge of histamine, {{but it has been}} proven that they do prevent a part of the chain reaction activated by this biogenic amine, which considerably lowers hay fever symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|Current {{scope of}} practice: [...] Ibuprofen, 3/12 lead ECG acquisition, nasopharyngeal airway, nebulised salbutamol, nebulised ipratropium, GTN spray, IM glucagon, {{laryngeal}} mask airway, ondansetron (oral), <b>loratadine,</b> PEEP valve, adrenaline (IM, IN and nebulised), prednisone, tramadol, urinary catheter troubleshooting, laryngoscopy (Wellington Free Ambulance), Magills forceps.|$|E
2500|$|Diphenhydramine is not {{recommended}} for people older than 60 or {{children under the age}} of six, unless a physician is consulted. These populations should be treated with second-generation antihistamines such as <b>loratadine,</b> desloratadine, fexofenadine, cetirizine, levocetirizine, and azelastine. Due to its strong anticholinergic effects, diphenhydramine is on the [...] "Beers list" [...] of drugs to avoid in the elderly.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, in an {{unprecedented}} action, the American insurance company Anthem petitioned the FDA to allow <b>loratadine</b> and two other antihistamines to be made available over the counter (OTC) {{while it was still}} under patent; the FDA granted the request, which was not binding on manufacturers. In the US, Schering-Plough made <b>loratadine</b> available OTC in 2002. [...] As of 2015 <b>loratadine</b> was available in many countries OTC.|$|E
50|$|<b>Loratadine</b> is a {{tricyclic}} antihistamine, {{which acts}} as a selective inverse agonist of peripheral histamine H1-receptors. The potency of 2nd generation histamine antagonists is (from weakest to strongest) desloratadine > cetirizine > <b>loratadine</b> > fexofenadine.|$|E
50|$|Substances {{that act}} as inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, cimetidine, and furanocoumarin {{derivatives}} (found in grapefruit) lead to increased plasma levels of <b>loratadine.</b> This had clinically significant effects in controlled trials of higher-than-usual doses of <b>loratadine</b> (20 mg).|$|E
50|$|<b>Loratadine</b> is {{indicated}} for the symptomatic relief of allergy such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis), urticaria (hives), chronic idiopathic urticaria, and other skin allergies. For allergic rhinitis (hay fever), <b>loratadine</b> is effective for both nasal and eye symptoms: sneezing, runny nose, itchy or burning eyes.|$|E

50|$|H1 and H2 blockers, such as <b>loratadine,</b> doxepin, or cimetidine, have {{historically}} been {{the first line of}} pharmacological treatment, but not all sufferers find relief with these medications. When antihistamines do work, <b>loratadine</b> seems to be the most effective for mild cases and doxepin most effective for more severe cases.|$|E
50|$|Schering-Plough {{developed}} <b>loratadine</b> {{as part of}} a {{quest for}} a potential blockbuster drug: a nonsedating antihistamine. However, by the time Schering submitted the drug to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval, the agency had already approved a competitor's nonsedating antihistamine, terfenadine (trade name Seldane), and, therefore, put <b>loratadine</b> on a lower priority.|$|E
50|$|Schering also {{developed}} desloratadine (Clarinex), {{which is an}} active metabolite of <b>loratadine.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Loratadine</b> was {{introduced}} as a non-sedating second generation antihistamine in the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Loratadine</b> {{is given}} orally, is well absorbed from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, and has rapid first-pass hepatic metabolism; it is metabolized by isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and, {{to a lesser}} extent, several others. <b>Loratadine</b> is almost totally (97-99%) bound to plasma proteins. Its metabolite desloratadine, which is {{largely responsible for the}} antihistaminergic effects, binds to plasma proteins by 73-76%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Loratadine</b> was {{discovered}} in 1981 and came to market in 1993. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Loratadine</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.01 to 0.08 USD per dose. In the United States it is available over the counter.|$|E

50|$|Desloratadine is a {{tricyclic}} H1-antihistamine {{that is used}} {{to treat}} allergies. It is an active metabolite of <b>loratadine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Loratadine</b> is a long-acting {{antihistamine}} (H1 histamine antagonist) {{that is less}} sedating {{than older}} substances of its type.|$|E
50|$|Similarly to cetirizine, <b>loratadine</b> attenuates the itching {{associated}} with Kimura's disease. It is marketed for its less sedating properties.|$|E
5000|$|Cimetidine {{has been}} shown {{clinically}} to reduce the clearance of mirtazapine, imipramine, timolol, nebivolol, sparteine, <b>loratadine,</b> nortriptyline, gabapentin, and desipramine in humans.|$|E
50|$|In December, 1996, the Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} the first prescription drug with Zydis technology {{sold in the}} U.S., Claritin RediTabs (<b>loratadine)</b> from Schering-Plough.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is also a}} newer second {{generation}} of antihistamines that are generally classified as the [...] "non-sedating antihistamines" [...] or anti-drowsy, which include cetirizine, <b>loratadine,</b> and fexofenadine.|$|E
50|$|As of 2017 <b>loratadine</b> was {{available}} under many brand names and dosage forms worldwide, including several combination drug formulations with pseudoephedrine, paracetamol, betamethasone, ambroxol, salbutamol, phenylephrine, and dexamethasone.|$|E
5000|$|As a [...] "non-sedating" [...] antihistamine, <b>loratadine</b> causes less (but still significant, in some cases) {{sedation}} and {{psychomotor retardation}} than the older antihistamines because it penetrates the blood/brain barrier {{to a smaller}} extent.|$|E
50|$|Terfenadine, {{the first}} non-sedating antihistamine, {{had to be}} {{withdrawn}} from the market {{because of the small}} risk of a serious side effect. However, terfenadine was discovered to be the prodrug of the active molecule, fexofenadine, which does not carry the same risks as the parent compound. Therefore, fexofenadine could be placed on the market as a safe replacement for the original drug. <b>Loratadine,</b> another non-sedating antihistamine, is the prodrug of desloratadine, which is largely responsible for the antihistaminergic effects of the parent compound. However, in this case the parent compound does not have the side effects associated with terfenadine, and so both <b>loratadine</b> and its active metabolite, desloratadine, are currently marketed.|$|E
5000|$|Desloratadine is used {{to treat}} {{allergic}} rhinitis and nasal congestion. [...] It is the major metabolite of <b>loratadine</b> and the two drugs are similar in safety and effectiveness. Desloratadine is available in many dosage forms and under many trade names worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Current {{scope of}} practice: Ibuprofen, 3/12 lead ECG acquisition, nasopharyngeal airway, nebulised salbutamol, nebulised ipratropium, GTN spray, IM glucagon, {{laryngeal}} mask airway, ondansetron (oral), <b>loratadine,</b> PEEP valve, adrenaline (IM, IN and nebulised), prednisone, tramadol, urinary catheter troubleshooting, laryngoscopy (Wellington Free Ambulance), Magills forceps.|$|E
50|$|<b>Loratadine,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Claritin among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat allergies. This includes allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and hives. It is also available in combination with pseudoephedrine, a decongestant, known as loratadine/pseudoephedrine. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|Clemastine, {{also known}} as meclastin, is an {{antihistamine}} and anticholinergic. Unlike <b>loratadine</b> or fexofenadine, clemastine is a sedating antihistamine; however, it exhibits fewer other side effects {{than most of the}} widely used antihistamines. Clemastine is also classified as an antipruritic (i.e., it stops itching).|$|E
