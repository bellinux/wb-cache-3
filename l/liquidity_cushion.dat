40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the impact on economic activity caused by a greater exposition of the financial institutions to risk taking into account macroeconomic factors. Hence, this paper considers two indicators for perceiving the banking risk for the Brazilian case. The first is the Basel index as a measurement of prudential regulation. The second one is the risk of total loss, that is, the default risk of an institution which can create a systemic crisis. Empirical evidence is presented based on dynamic panel data, ordinary least squares, and quantile regression for a sample of 66 Brazilian banks in the period from 2001 to 2009. The findings denote that an increase in the banking risk is associated with a greater economic activity. Therefore, there exists indication that the use of a <b>liquidity</b> <b>cushion</b> in the periods of economic growth can be used as an anti-cyclical tool for avoiding bubbles in the financial market...|$|E

The views expressed in the papers are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect those of the Banco Central do Brasil. This work develops an integrated model for optimal asset allocation in commercial banks that incorporates uncertain liquidity constraints that are currently ignored by RAROC and EVA models. While the economic profit accounts for the opportunity cost of risky assets, what may even incorporate a market liquidity premium, it neglects the risk of failure {{due to the lack of}} sufficient funds to cope with unexpected cash demands arising from bank runs, drawdowns, or market, credit and operational losses, what may happen along with credit rationing episodes or systemic level dry ups. Given a liquidity constraint that can incorporate these factors, there is a failure probability fP that the constraint will not hold, resulting in a value loss for the bank, represented by a stochastic failure loss fL. By assuming that bankers are risk neutral in their decision about the size of the <b>liquidity</b> <b>cushion,</b> the economic profit less the possible losses due to the lack of liquidity is optimized, resulting in a short-term asset allocation model that integrates market, credit and operational risks in the liquidity management of banks.

Even though a general approach is suggested through simulation, I provide a closed form solution for Pf, under some simplifying assumptions, that may be useful for research and supervision purposes as an indicator of the liquidity management adequacy in the banking system. I also suggest an extreme value theory approach for the estimation of, departing from other liquidity management models that use a penalty rate over the demand of cash that exceeds the availability of liquid resources. The model was applied to Brazilian banks data resulting in gains over the optimization without liquidity considerations that are robust under several tests, giving empirical indications that the model may have a relevant impact on the value creation in banks. ...|$|E
40|$|After {{widening}} {{substantially in}} the period preceding the global financial crisis, current account imbalances across the world have contracted to a significant extent. This paper analyzes the factors underlying this process of external adjustment. It finds that countries whose pre-crisis current account balances were in excess {{of what could be}} explained by economic fundamentals have experienced the largest contractions in their external balance. External adjustment in deficit countries was achieved primarily through demand compression, rather than expenditure switching. Changes in other investment flows were the main channel of financial account adjustment, with official external assistance and ECB <b>liquidity</b> <b>cushioning</b> the exit of private capital flows for some countries.

40|$|Empirical {{analysis}} {{does not}} suggest that reserves are “too high ” {{in the majority of}} Asian countries, though China may be a special case. Much of the reserve increase in Asia can be explained by an optimal insurance model under which reserves provide a steady source of <b>liquidity</b> to <b>cushion</b> the impact of a sudden stop in capital inflows on output and consumption. Moreover, the benefits of reserves in terms of reduced spreads on privately held external debt further explains the observed growth in reserves since 1997 – 98. Using threshold estimation techniques, the paper shows that most of Asia can still benefit from higher reserves in terms of reduced borrowing costs.
