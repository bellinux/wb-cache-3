40|$|Abstract. A {{model for}} {{integration}} of low-level responses to damage, potential damage and component failure in robots is presented. This model {{draws on the}} notion of inflammation and introduces an extensible, sub-symbolic mechanism for modulating high-level behaviour using the notion of artificial inflammation. Preliminary results obtained via simulation are presented and demonstrate the potential benefits of such a scheme. Additionally the system maps the robot’s physiological state-space, which is defined in terms of the levels and sources of inflammatory response. This is achieved using Kohonen’s Self-Organizing Map algorithm to arrange the states experienced during the lifetime of the robot. The future use of this map for diagnosis and <b>localization</b> <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> and for the generation of specific high-level remediation behaviour is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Locating faults in {{spreadsheets}} can be difficult. Therefore, tools {{supporting the}} <b>localization</b> <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> are needed. Model-based software debugging (MBSD) is a promising fault local-ization technique. This paper presents a novel dependency-based model {{that can be}} used in MBSD. This model allows improvements of the diagnostic accuracy while keeping the computation times short. In an empirical evaluation, we show that dependency-based models of spreadsheets whose value-based models are often not solvable in an acceptable amount of time can be solved in less than one second. Fur-thermore, we show that the amount of diagnoses obtained through dependency-based models is reduced by 15 % on average when using the novel model instead of the origi-nal dependency-based model. The short computation time and the improved diagnostic accuracy enable the usage of model-based debugging for spreadsheets in practice...|$|E

There is a need for an efficient fault diagnosis in distributed computer systems, as detection and <b>localization</b> <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> - especially system faults within the local area network - are time consuming and therefore expensive because of the difficult assignment of faults to components.

The Rangitaiki Fault (Whakatane Graben, New Zealand) and its adjacent faults accommodated an overall extension of ? 0. 83 % oriented at ?N 324 °E over the past 17 kyr.

Operational principle of the lock-in method is discussed, and it is represented that phase shift of the thermal emission from a silicon wafer stacked heat source chip (SSHSC) specimen can provide good metrics for the depth of the heat source buried in SSHSCs. Depth was also estimated by analyzing the transient thermal responses using the coupled electro-thermal simulations. Furthermore, the effects of the volumetric heat source configuration mimicking the 3 D through silicon via integration package were investigated.

The performance of two processors is sacrificed {{for the detection}} and <b>localization</b> <b>of</b> <b>faults.</b> Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) offers the detection of transient faults at only 20 - 40 % performance degradation. Most of these techniques rely on the duplicated execution of the same process on different hardware threads. Due to SMT, the execution can be parallel or time-shifted. The fact that e. g. {{the direction of a}} branch or the value of a load encountered by the thread which is executing ahead is exploited by using structures like the branch outcome queue (BOQ) or the value outcome queue (VOQ). In this work we will first extend the idea of the BOQ / VOQ to a more sophisticated structure, so that results being produced by the leading thread can be consumed faster by the trailing thread. Additionally, we propose how the scheme can help to detect transient and permanent bus faults. We validated the scheme by using a FPGA implementation, including a branch target address and instruction cache. The results show a space increase of less than 4 % and a speedup of 20 %...|$|E

It {{has been widely}} used to model advanced Cyber-Physical Systems, e. g. in the automotive or avionics industry. To ensure the reliability of Simulink models (i. e., ensuring that they are free of faults), these models are subject to extensive testing to verify the logic and behavior of software modules developed in the models. Due to the complex structure of Simulink models, finding root causes of failures (i. e., faults) is an expensive and time-consuming task. Therefore, {{there is a high}} demand for automatic fault localization techniques that can help en- gineers to locate faults in Simulink models with less human intervention. This demand leads to the proposal and development of various approaches and techniques that are able to automatically locate faults in Simulink models. Fault localization has been an active research area that focuses on developing automated tech- niques to support software debugging. Although there have been many techniques proposed to localize faults in programs, there has not been much research on fault localization for Simulink models.

40|$|Frequency {{response}} analysis (FRA) is a frequency-domain method {{which is}} used to detect mechanical faults in transformers. The frequency response of a transformer is determined by its geometry and material properties, and it can be considered as the transformer’s fingerprint. If there are any mechanical changes in the transformer, for example if the windings are moved or distorted, its fingerprint will also be changed so, theoretically, mechanical changes in the transformer can be detected with FRA. A problem with FRA is {{the fact that there is}} no general agreement about how to interpret the measurement results for detection of winding damages. For instance, the interpretation of measurement results has still not been standardized. The overall goal of this thesis is to try to enhance the understanding of the information contained in FRA measurements. This has been done in two ways: (1) by examining the FRA method for (much) higher frequencies than what is usual, and (2) by developing a new method in which FRA is combined with the ideas of Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR). As tools for carrying out the above mentioned steps, models for the magnetic core and the winding have been developed and verified by comparison to measurements. The usual upper frequency limit for FRA is around 2 MHz, which in this thesis has been extended by an order of magnitude in order to detect and interpret new phenomena that emerge at high frequencies and to investigate the potential of this high-frequency region for detection of winding deteriorations. Further, in the above-mentioned new method developed in this thesis, FRA and TDR are combined as a step towards an easier and more intuitive detection and <b>localization</b> <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> in transformer windings, where frequency response measurements are visualized in the time domain in order to facilitate their interpretation.

Fault detection and isolation are important features to ensure their reliable operation. This research work aims to achieve an integrated control and fault detection functionality with minimum number of components. Piezomaterials can be used both as sensors and actuators due to their inherent coupling between electrical and mechanical properties. In this thesis, piezoelectric actuators which are being researched for active vibration control on flexible rotors, are also used as sensors. These self-sensing actuators reconstruct their mechanical deflection from the measured voltage and current signals. The systems under investigation are a numerical aircraft engine model and its scaled representation in a rotor test bench. Since the actuators are mounted in rotor bearings, their displacement represent the bearing deflection directly. In this research work, the virtual sensor signals are utilised for model-based fault diagnosis in rotor systems, with focus on unbalances in rotors. Unbalance magnitude and phase were estimated in frequency domain using a parameter estimation method by least squares optimisation. The robustness of the estimates against signal outliers is improved by method of M-estimators. Identifying the fault location is also explored using the hypothesis of <b>localization</b> <b>of</b> <b>faults.</b> In simulation, models of both systems (aircraft engine and test bench) were used to detect unbalance faults. In the former system, the influence of actuator placements in fault detection ability is examined. The fault detection method is also validated at the real test bench, as a first step.
