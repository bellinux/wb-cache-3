5|$|Carbon-14 (C) is a {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope, {{created in the}} upper atmosphere (<b>lower</b> <b>stratosphere</b> and upper troposphere) by interaction of nitrogen with cosmic rays. It is found in trace amounts on Earth of up to 1 part per trillion (0.0000000001%), mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits, particularly of peat and other organic materials. This isotope decays by 0.158MeV β emission. Because of its relatively short half-life of 5730years, C is virtually absent in ancient rocks. The amount of C in the atmosphere and in living organisms is almost constant, but decreases predictably in their bodies after death. This principle is used in radiocarbon dating, invented in 1949, which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40,000years.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of a temperature inversion in the <b>lower</b> <b>stratospheres</b> of both Uranus and Neptune is confirmed by the 20 -micron photometric data presented. It is found that the brightness temperature difference between 17. 8 and 19. 6 microns is 0. 8 + or - 0. 5 K for Uranus and 1. 8 + or - 0. 6 K for Neptune, implying that the temperature inversions of both planets are weaker than previously thought. Comparisons with model atmospheres suggested by Appleby (1980) imply that these temperature inversions may {{be understood as a}} consequence of heating through CH 4 and aerosol absorption of sunlight. The stratospheric CH 4 mixing ratio of Neptune must, however, be higher than that at the temperature minimum...|$|R

The main point of interest was the increase of CO concentration by the order of 10 ppb that took place simultaneously with a temperature decrease of several degrees, which {{was regarded as a}} result of enhanced cooling to space due to CO 2 decomposition. Later inspection of the original magnetogram of eleven auroral zone stations revealed that the observation started 13 hours after the main phase of a geomagnetic storm, which lasted for 22 hours.

500|$|Heating of {{the earth}} near the equator leads to large amounts of {{convection}} along the monsoon trough or Intertropical convergence zone.

The resulting air mass subsidence creates a subtropical ridge of high pressure near the 30th parallel in both hemispheres. At the surface level, the sinking air diverges again with some returning to the equator, completing the Hadley circulation. [...] This circulation on each side of the equator is known as the Hadley cell and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge.

2500|$|The {{nuclear winter}} {{scenario}} assumes that 100 or more city firestorms are ignited by nuclear explosions, {{and that the}} firestorms lifts large amounts of sooty smoke into the upper troposphere and <b>lower</b> <b>stratosphere</b> by the movement offered by the pyrocumulonimbus clouds that form during a firestorm.

This aerosol of particles could heat the stratosphere and prevent a portion of the sun's light from reaching the surface, causing surface temperatures to drop drastically. In this scenario it is predicted that surface air temperatures would be the same as, or colder than, a given region's winter for months to years on end.|$|E

This is not to say that fires won't occur over a large area after a detonation, but rather that the fires would not coalesce and form the stratospheric firestorm plume that the nuclear winter papers require in their climate computer models. The nuclear bombing of Nagasaki for example, did not produce a firestorm.

2500|$|In 1970 Paul Crutzen {{pointed out}} that {{emissions}} of nitrous oxide (...) , a stable, long-lived gas produced by soil bacteria, from the Earth's surface could affect the amount of nitric oxide (NO) in the stratosphere. Crutzen showed that nitrous oxide lives long enough to reach the stratosphere, where it is converted into NO. Crutzen then noted that increasing use of fertilizers might have led {{to an increase in}} nitrous oxide emissions over the natural background, which would in turn result in an increase in the amount of NO in the stratosphere. Thus human activity could affect the stratospheric ozone layer. In the following year, Crutzen and (independently) Harold Johnston suggested that NO emissions from supersonic passenger aircraft, which would fly in the <b>lower</b> <b>stratosphere,</b> could also deplete the ozone layer. However, more recent analysis in 1995 by David W. Fahey, an atmospheric scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, found that the drop in ozone would be from 1–2 percent if a fleet of 500 supersonic passenger aircraft were operated. This, Fahey expressed, would not be a showstopper for advanced supersonic passenger aircraft development.|$|E

The objective of the project was to systematically investigate two essential aspects relevant in ozone research: for one thing, the contribution of (tropical) ozone to the dynamics of QBO; for another, the impact of large-scale dynamic effects of QBO on global ozone distribution. The aim was to gain deeper insight into the mechanisms governing natural ozone variability. (orig. /KW) Die nahezu zweijaehrige Oszillation (engl. quasibiennial oscillation, QBO) des zonalen Windes und der Temperatur dominiert die Dynamik in der unteren tropischen Stratosphaere. Mit ihrer Phase beeinflusst die QBO zudem die Ausbreitungseigenschaften planetarer Wellen und somit auch die Dynamik der Stratosphaere in hoeheren Breiten. Dadurch aendert sich nicht nur der Ozontransport aus der photochemischen Quellregion des Ozons in der unteren tropischen Stratosphaere, sondern auch die globale Verteilung des Ozons in Abhaengigkeit von der QBO.

40|$|In {{response}} {{to global warming}} the Brewer–Dobson circulation in the stratosphere is expected to accelerate and the mean transport time of air along this circulation to decrease. This would imply a negative stratospheric age of air trend, i. e. an air parcel would need less time to travel from the tropopause to any point in the stratosphere. Age of air as inferred from tracer observations, however, shows zero to positive trends in the Northern midlatitude stratosphere and zonally asymmetric patterns. Using satellite 5 observations and model calculations we show that the observed latitudinal and vertical patterns of the decadal changes of age of air in the <b>lower</b> to middle <b>stratosphere</b> during 2002 – 2012 are predominantly caused by a southward shift of the circulation pattern of about 5 degrees. After correction for this shift, the observations reveal a hemispherically almost symmetric decrease of age of air in the <b>lower</b> to middle <b>stratosphere</b> up to 800 [*]K of up to − 0. 25 years over the 2002 – 2012 period with strongest decrease in the Northern tropics.
