5|$|In 1959, {{longtime}} NFL commissioner Bert Bell {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} while attending an Eagles/Steelers game at Franklin Field. That same year, Dallas businessman Lamar Hunt led the formation of the rival American Football League, the fourth such league to bear that name, with war hero and former South Dakota Governor Joe Foss as its Commissioner. Unlike the earlier rival leagues, and bolstered by television exposure, the AFL posed a significant threat to NFL dominance of the professional football world. With the exception of <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> the AFL avoided placing teams in markets where they directly competed with established NFL franchises. In 1960, the AFL began play with eight teams and a double round-robin schedule of fourteen games. New NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle took office the same year.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, Los Angeles-based Manimal Vinyl {{record company}} {{announced}} its plan of releasing a compilation album containing cover versions of songs by American singer Madonna.

Manimal Vinyl label head Paul Beahan confirmed that 25% of the profit earned from the album sales would be donated to Madonna's Raising Malawi foundation.

Special release parties were organized in <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> featuring the artists who recorded songs for the project.|$|E

Producers viewed over 1,000 applicants from <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> First attending a tryout in lieu of a friend, and later passing multiple auditions, television warm-up comedian Marc Summers was one of two finalists advancing to a final audition. Each hosted a mock game for Nickelodeon to make an ultimate decision on who would host Double Dare. The producers felt the way Summers ended the game by leading into a commercial break was more professional and he was hired for the position {{in the first week of}} September 1986. Because focus groups showed that the audience thought he was more than 10 years younger than he actually was, Summers was obligated by Nickelodeon for years to not mention his age publicly.|$|E
