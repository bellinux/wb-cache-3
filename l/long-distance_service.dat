5|$|After World War II, North Philadelphia {{suffered}} from the failure of its industries, and the PRR reduced both local and <b>long-distance</b> <b>service</b> due to competition from private autos, further reducing {{the importance of the}} station. Escalators and a new drop ceiling were added around 1955, the former due to the insistence of the city council. The surrounding parking lots and ground were rearranged in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{service to}} Lock Haven {{residents}} {{is provided by}} PPL Electric Utilities (formerly known as Pennsylvania Power and Light). UGI Central Penn Gas provides natural gas to the city. Verizon Communications handles local telephone service; <b>long-distance</b> <b>service</b> is available from several providers. Comcast offers high-speed cable modem connections to the Internet. Several companies can provide Lock Haven residents with dial-up Internet access. One of them, KCnet, has an office in Lock Haven. Comcast also provides cable television.|$|E
5|$|Budd built 361 Amfleet I coaches; 90 were {{configured}} for long-distance use (60 seats) and 271 for short-distance use (84 seats). All 125 Amfleet II {{coaches were}} designed for <b>long-distance</b> <b>service</b> and contained 59 seats. In all standard Amfleet coaches seating is 2×2; in the Amfleet II a single accessible seat accounted for the odd number. Amfleet seats have swing-down tray-tables for at-seat food service, as well as overhead and underseat luggage storage. There are two restrooms {{at one end of}} the car. There is a baggage rack at the end of the car. On some cars these have been replaced with a bicycle rack.|$|E

5|$|Amfleet is a {{fleet of}} single-level {{intercity}} railroad passenger cars built by the Budd Company for American company Amtrak in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Budd based the Amfleet design on its earlier Metroliner electric multiple unit. An initial order for 57 cars in 1973 to supplement the Metroliners on the Northeast Corridor grew to two orders totaling 642 cars, sufficient to reequip all the services on the Northeast Corridor and many other routes around the United States. The first 492 cars, known as Amfleet I and completed between 1975–1977, were designed for short-distance service. A second order of 150 cars, known as Amfleet II and completed between 1980–1983, were designed for <b>long-distance</b> <b>service.</b> They were the last intercity passenger cars built by Budd.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak {{announced}} in October 1976 that the North Coast Hiawatha {{would be the}} second train, after the Empire Builder, to receive the new bi-level Superliner coaches, then on order from Pullman Standard. In the end the train was cancelled before the Superliners entered <b>long-distance</b> <b>service.</b> In the spring of 1977 Amtrak added seven hours to the schedule, increasing it to 52 hours 30 minutes. The change was prompted by new speed restrictions on Amtrak trains after a rash of derailments involving the new EMD SDP40F diesel locomotives. In September Amtrak eliminated the off-day ChicagoSt. Paul service, leaving the North Coast Hiawatha with three trips a week. Amtrak reduced the Empire Builder to quad-weekly service as well. The Twin Cities Hiawatha returned as a daytime service between Chicago and Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|Marylebone was reprieved {{from the}} threat of closure on 30 April 1986, and an £85million {{modernisation}} and refurbishment programme of the station and its services was granted. This was funded by selling part of the station to developers, including two of the original four platforms at the west of the station and the third span of the train shed. In order to replace these, the central cab road was removed, and two new platforms numbered 2 and 3 were created in its place. The run-down lines into Marylebone were modernised with new signalling and higher line speeds. In 1991, the fleet of Class 115 trains on local services was replaced by Class 165 Turbo trains, and service frequencies were increased. Services to Banbury were extended to the reopened Birmingham Snow Hill station in 1993, creating the first <b>long-distance</b> <b>service</b> into Marylebone since 1966. Initially this service ran at two-hourly intervals, but it proved popular and was increased to an hourly frequency in 1994.|$|E
50|$|The {{journey time}} between Leipzig and Dresden-Neustadt was {{projected}} to decline for <b>long-distance</b> <b>services</b> from 91 {{minutes before the}} start of construction to 47 minutes.

5|$|The rollout of Amfleets {{throughout}} {{the system was}} restricted by the availability of locomotives with HEP or special generator cars. The first route outside the Northeast Corridor to receive Amfleets was the Washington–Martinsburg Blue Ridge, on December 1. By November 1976, 350 Amfleets had been delivered and 78% of Amtrak's short-haul trains used either Amfleets or equally-modern Turboliner trainsets. Routes using Amfleets outside the Northeast Corridor included the Blue Ridge, Colonial, Twilight Limited, Wolverine, Illinois Zephyr, Abraham Lincoln, State House, Illini, Shawnee, Black Hawk, San Joaquin, Mount Rainier, Pacific International, Puget Sound, and San Diegan. The Amfleet's modern HEP system proved invaluable during the unusually harsh winter of 1976–1977, which sidelined many of Amtrak's aging steam-heated coaches. Amtrak suspended numerous routes and pressed the short-distance Amfleet I coaches into <b>long-distance</b> <b>service.</b> Budd completed delivery of the Amfleet I order on June 9, 1977.|$|E
25|$|The B ended {{local service}} on the Frederick Branch in November 1949. All B {{passenger}} service between Baltimore and Philadelphia ended in 1958; local service from Washington was curtailed to Camden Station. The B continued to offer local service to Brunswick plus <b>long-distance</b> <b>service,</b> while the PRR operated a mix of local, intercity, and <b>long-distance</b> <b>service</b> on the Northeast Corridor. Local service north of Baltimore on the PRR ended around 1964.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the middle}} of 2006, the tax was {{collected}} by telephone companies with respect to local and long-distance telephone services. Collection of the tax on most <b>long-distance</b> <b>service</b> was then halted due to a controversy that erupted over {{the wording of the}} law and the way telephone service is billed today.|$|E

25|$|Today's {{telephone}} {{excise tax}} {{derives from the}} Revenue Bill of 1932. Since then, it has been reauthorized 29 times. The 1932 Act was passed {{in response to a}} federal budget deficit brought about because of a decline in income tax receipts caused by an economic depression rather than as a result of war. Initially the tax was levied only on interstate (<b>long-distance)</b> <b>service.</b> The telephone excise tax was extended five times (between 1933 and 1941) before the tax was first applied to local telephone service.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{vertical}} monopoly, by 1940 the Bell System effectively owned most telephone service in the United States, from local and <b>long-distance</b> <b>service</b> to the telephones themselves. This allowed Bell to prohibit its customers from connecting phones not made or sold by Bell to the system without paying fees. For example, if a customer desired a type of phone not leased by the local Bell monopoly, he or she had to purchase the phone at cost, give it to the phone company, then pay a 're-wiring' charge and a monthly lease fee in order to use it.|$|E
25|$|Perlman's cuts {{resulted}} in the curtailing {{of many of the}} railroad's services; commuter lines around New York were particularly affected. In 1958-59 service was suspended on the NYC's Putnam Division in Westchester and Putnam counties, and the NYC abandoned its ferry service across the Hudson to Weehawken Terminal. This negatively impacted the railroad's West Shore Line, which ran along {{the west bank of the}} Hudson River from Jersey City to Albany, which saw <b>long-distance</b> <b>service</b> to Albany discontinued in 1958 and commuter service between Jersey City and West Haverstraw, New York terminated in 1959. Ridding itself of most of its commuter service proved impossible due to the heavy use of these lines around metro New York, which government mandated the railroad still operate.|$|E
25|$|The first streamlined, non-articulated diesel {{locomotive}} in the U.S., EMC EA-EB#51, began using Camden Station's lower level platforms in 1937, pulling the B's famed Royal Blue. In {{addition to its}} New York–Washington service and frequent commuter trains to Washington, the B also operated extensive <b>long-distance</b> <b>service</b> at Camden Station to such cities as Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and St. Louis. The Capitol Limited, Shenandoah, and Washington–Chicago Express to Chicago and the National Limited, Diplomat, and Metropolitan Special to St. Louis were among the many trains arriving and departing daily from the station {{during the first half}} of the 20thcentury. When the modern-era Major League Baseball Baltimore Orioles began playing in Baltimore, they arrived at Camden by B train from Detroit for their inaugural home opening game of the 1954 season.|$|E

25|$|Amtrak is {{no longer}} {{required}} by law to operate a national route system, but it is encouraged to do so. Amtrak has presence in 46 of the 48 contiguous states (lacking Wyoming and South Dakota). Amtrak services fall into three groups: short-haul service on the Northeast Corridor, state-supported short haul service outside the Northeast Corridor, and <b>long-distance</b> <b>service</b> known within Amtrak as the National Network. Amtrak receives federal funding {{for the vast majority of}} its operations including the central spine of the Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington DC as well as for its National long distance routes. In addition to the federally funded routes, Amtrak partners with transportation agencies in 18 states to operate other short and medium haul routes outside of the Northeast Corridor, some of which connect to it or are extensions off of it. In addition to its inter-city services, Amtrak also operates commuter services for three state agencies including MARC in Maryland, Shore Line East in Connecticut, and Metrolink in California.|$|E
