5|$|Once {{inside the}} skin, dengue virus binds to <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> (a {{population}} of dendritic {{cells in the}} skin that identifies pathogens). The virus enters the cells through binding between viral proteins and membrane proteins on the Langerhans cell, specifically the C-type lectins called DC-SIGN, mannose receptor and CLEC5A. DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, {{seems to be the}} main point of entry. The dendritic cell moves to the nearest lymph node. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's endoplasmic reticulum, where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral RNA and begin to form viral particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the Golgi apparatus, the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains (glycoproteins). The now mature new viruses are released by exocytosis. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as monocytes and macrophages.|$|E
25|$|Prostaglandin (PGD2) is {{the primary}} cause of the {{flushing}} reaction, with serotonin appearing to have a secondary role in this reaction. The effect is mediated by prostaglandin E2 and D2 due to GPR109A activation of epidermal <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> and keratinocytes. <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> use cyclooxygenase type 1 (COX-1) for PGE2 production and are more responsible for acute flushing, while keratinocytes are COX-2 dependent and are in active continued vasodilation. Flushing was often thought to involve histamine, but histamine has been shown not {{to be involved in the}} reaction.|$|E

25|$|IM and ID DNA {{delivery}} initiate immune responses differently. In the skin, keratinocytes, fibroblasts and <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> take up {{and express}} antigens and {{are responsible for}} inducing a primary antibody response. Transfected <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> migrate out of the skin (within 12 hours) to the draining lymph node where they prime secondary B- and T-cell responses. In skeletal muscle striated muscle cells are most frequently transfected, but seem to be unimportant in immune response. Instead, IM inoculated DNA “washes” into the draining lymph node within minutes, where distal dendritic cells are transfected and then initiate an immune response. Transfected myocytes seem {{to act as a}} “reservoir” of antigen for trafficking professional APCs.|$|E

40|$|Objective: <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> {{histiocytosis}} is {{an unusual}} disorder of unknown etiology with heterogeneous clinical behaviors and variable outcomes. It can involve one or more organs or systems, but to our best knowledge, parotid glands involvement in <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> histiocytosis is extremely rare in English literature. Method: We report a 13 -month-old girl who presented with bilateral parotid swelling as presenting symptom. She was misdiagnosed for 4 months, but final diagnosis was multisystem <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> histiocytosis. Result: After being treated for 18 months, the patient acquired complete remission and attained similar growth status to other healthy children. Conclusion: <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> histiocytosis may involve any organ; in patients with parotid enlargement, <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> histiocytosis {{should be kept in}} mind in the differential diagnoses.

25|$|When DNA uptake and {{subsequent}} expression was first demonstrated in vivo in muscle cells, these cells {{were thought to}} be unique because of their extensive network of T-tubules. Using electron microscopy, it was proposed that DNA uptake was facilitated by caveolae (or, non-clathrin coated pits). However, subsequent research revealed that other cells (such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and epithelial <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells)</b> could also internalize DNA.

25|$|Dark skin offers great {{protection}} against UVR {{because of its}} eumelanin content, the UVR-absorbing capabilities of large melanosomes, and because eumelanin can be mobilized faster and brought {{to the surface of}} the skin from the depths of the epidermis. For the same body region, light- and dark-skinned individuals have similar numbers of melanocytes (there is considerable variation between different body regions), but pigment-containing organelles, called melanosomes, are larger and more numerous in dark-skinned individuals. Keratocytes from dark skin cocultured with melanocytes give rise to a melanosome distribution pattern characteristic of dark skin. Melanosomes are not in aggregated state in darkly pigmented skin compared to lightly pigmented skin. Due to the heavily melanised melanosomes in darkly pigmented skin, it can absorb more energy from UVR and thus offers better {{protection against}} sunburns and by absorption and dispersion UV rays. Darkly pigmented skin protects against direct and indirect DNA damage. Photodegration occurs when melanin absorbs photons. Recent research suggest that the photoprotective effect of dark skin is increased by the fact that melanin can capture free radicals, such as hydrogen peroxide, which are created by the interaction of UVR and layers of the skin. Heavily pigmented melanocytes have greater capacity to divide after UVR irradiation, which suggests that they receive less damage to their DNA. Despite this, UVB damages the immune system even in darker skinned individuals due to its effect on <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells.</b> The stratum corneum of people with dark or heavily tanned skin is more condensed and contains more cornified cell layers than in lightly pigmented humans. These qualities of dark skin enhance the barrier protection function of the skin.|$|E
500|$|There are {{plausible}} explanations {{based on}} human biology for how circumcision can decrease {{the likelihood of}} female-to-male HIV transmission. The superficial skin layers of the penis contain <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells,</b> which are targeted by HIV; removing the foreskin reduces the number of these cells. [...] When an uncircumcised penis is erect during intercourse, any small tears on the inner surface of the foreskin come into {{direct contact with the}} vaginal walls, providing a pathway for transmission. When an uncircumcised penis is flaccid, the pocket between the inside of the foreskin {{and the head of the}} penis provides an environment conducive to pathogen survival; circumcision eliminates this pocket. Some experimental evidence has been provided to support these theories.|$|E
500|$|The {{epidermis}} is {{the most}} superficial layer of skin, a squamous epithelium with several strata: the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. [...] Nourishment is provided to these layers by diffusion from the dermis, since the epidermis is without direct blood supply. [...] The epidermis contains four cell types: keratinocytes, melanocytes, <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells,</b> and Merkel cells. Of these, keratinocytes are the major component, constituting roughly 95 percent of the epidermis. [...] This stratified squamous epithelium is maintained by cell division within the stratum basale, in which differentiating cells slowly displace outwards through the stratum spinosum to the stratum corneum, where cells are continually shed from the surface. [...] In normal skin, the rate of production equals the rate of loss; about two weeks are needed for a cell to migrate from the basal cell layer {{to the top of}} the granular cell layer, and an additional two weeks to cross the stratum corneum.|$|E
40|$|The gross morphology, density, {{distribution}} and ultrastructure of the <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> {{of the normal}} human exocervix were investigated. Two standardized zinc-iodide-osmium (ZIO) procedures were applied to epithelial sheets {{as well as to}} tissue samples processed for both light and electron microscopy. Conventional electron microscopical techniques were also used. The epithelial sheet preparation allowed the visualization of the whole profile of the <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell.</b> It was found that the number of cell processes and the degree of their branching varied greatly from one cell to another. The cells were tentatively grouped into five types and it is suggested that they represent different degrees of cell activity. The cells appeared unevenly distributed, but with a preferential location around the external os. In the three cases studied the cell density averaged 8. 3 LC/mm 2. The ultrastructural study revealed the classical fine structure of the <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell.</b> The cell processes and their branches contained all the organelles found in the perikaryon, including Golgi complexes and <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> granules. The two ZIO procedures revealed that the complex inner organization of the granule does not differ from that in the epidermal <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell.</b> It is concluded that the <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> is a constant component of the normal human exocervix...|$|R
40|$|Objective – <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> {{histiocytosis}} is a {{rare disease}} characterized by monoclonal proliferation and infiltration of organs by large mono-nuclear cells. Here we report a case of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> histiocytosis with non-classic perianal presentation and diabetes insipidus. Case report – A 10 -year-old male patient diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus was referred to us with the complaints of abdominal pain, bloody stool, and an irregular ulceration on the bilateral perianal re-gion. With the suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease the patient underwent colonoscopy {{and the result was}} normal. Due to the prior diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus the lesion was thought to be histiocytosis. A biopsy was performed and histological findings were consistent with <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> histiocytosis.

2500|$|The {{epidermis}} {{contains no}} blood vessels, and {{cells in the}} deepest layers are nourished almost exclusively by diffused oxygen from the surrounding air and to a far lesser degree by blood capillaries extending to the outer layers of the dermis.

The epidermis can be further subdivided into the following strata (beginning with the outermost layer): corneum, lucidum (only in palms of hands and bottoms of feet), granulosum, spinosum, basale. Cells are formed through mitosis at the basale layer. The daughter cells (see cell division) move up the strata changing shape and composition as they die due to isolation from their blood source. The cytoplasm is released and the protein keratin is inserted. They eventually reach the corneum and slough off (desquamation). This process is called [...] "keratinization".

2500|$|Type 1 (Juvenile onset).

The level of adult onset T1D plus ambiguous T1D/T2D is unknown. It is unclear how large a role Triticeae has in T1D, which also shows strong linkage to DQ2.5 and DQ8. Childhood (male) Type 1 diabetes increases the risk for GSE and vice versa and it now appears that GSE precedes T1D in many cases and an active search for coeliac disease in early juvenile diabetes patients revealed that GF diet resulted in some improvements. A high frequency of diabetes patients have anti-transglutaminase antibodies along with increased levels of gluten specific T-cells in T1D patients. From an evolutionary point of view it is difficult to explain the high association of T1D and DQ2.5 given negatively selective nature of the disease in NW European population given the number of studies suggesting that the [...] "Super B8" [...] haplotypes has been under positive selection, and appears to be the most characteristic HLA type in NW Europeans indicating an advanced natural history of the haplotype.
