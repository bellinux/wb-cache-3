Earlier the same year, President George Bush had named North Korea as one of three members of the Axis of Evil, which had upset some South Koreans; directing their anger at Ohno was a less direct way of voicing anger against Bush's decision. The controversy continued at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, held jointly in South Korea and Japan several months after the Olympics.

30|$|X {{has been}} in Italy for ten years. She has no {{relatives}} in Italy, and made use of her husband’s family network after marrying to found her own business. She engages in the import and export trade and wholesale footwear. For the entrepreneurial process, X recalled, “the marriage gifts were more than 10, 000 EUR in cash, because a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> husband’s <b>friends</b> are from Li Ao (a town in Wenzhou). They earn a lot. Most people start their businesses by relying on the cash received at marriage. They quickly married, and then added in their savings and started their business.” The support of friends and relatives {{played a key role}} in the early days: “From 2004 to 2009 my husband and I had no residency rights. If I saw the police, I fled every time. The companies we opened were under other people’s names. We made an agreement on how much money to pay them, and when there were things we needed we would let them come.” After the amnesty in 2009, X began to legitimately conduct her business. However, X’s business contacts within the family are limited to working together to compete against foreign competitors: “If other people have to get involved, we will unite as a family through large-scale purchases and developing a uniform price to crowd them out.” In addition, “The purchase of goods was done on our own. My husband's sister did not give us guidance. We all purchased from the same place and there was a competitive relationship; we all went around Rome to find our own products. We could not all buy the same goods. It’s not good for sisters and brothers. If she bought this brand, we had to get other brands to separate the customers. … I have always run my own separate business. There is no partnership with brothers and sisters. At the beginning my husband’s sister said, you do not understand Italian, you do not understand anything, and above all you have never not done business, so partnership is the way to do it. My husband and I had the money and we saw this store was cheap. We did not want a partnership. With a partnership there will certainly be no profit because profits have been accounted for to purchase the goods, and we cannot make money.” X believed she had entered the market too late. If she continued with the previous business model and partnered with family members, it would be difficult to have independent careers. Quickly learning the language and engaging in practical exploration of the market became X’s tools for entrepreneurial success: “I learned the language. I felt I could learn Italian on my own, and Italian is also very easy to learn. When I was in France I was using headphones to listen to French during work, and every night I stayed up to recite articles. I studied for one month and could speak the language. There is still some trouble with difficult things, but then I slowly get used to them.” With the language advantage, X established close contact with Italian customers. “Italian people are very smart. They are very sensitive to fashion.” Communication with Italian customers helped X gain a deeper understanding of fashion. X’s judgment on family relationships promoted her awareness of establishing relationships with local customers to expand her business, the only viable strategy for independently expanding the business. While enhancing business execution, it also establishes a wide range of alliances.|$|R
