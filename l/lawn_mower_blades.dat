50|$|The Mill's final miller, Oliver E. Collins, and {{his family}} came to Anselma in 1919. As the Great Depression descended on America in 1929, the Collins family resourcefully relied on their colonial-era grist mill to make a living. The family ran a saw mill and cider press, milled animal feed, and {{operated}} the Anselma Post Office from their home. Mr. Collins assembled a machine shop to create a repair service and sharpen <b>lawn</b> <b>mower</b> <b>blades,</b> and even cut hair for local residents.|$|E
50|$|Landscapers and lawn care {{specialist}} may use {{a portable}} trencher to install landscape edging and irrigation lines. These machines are lightweight (around 200 pounds) and are easily maneuverable {{compared to other}} types of trenchers. The cutting implement may be a chain or a blade similar to a rotary <b>lawn</b> <b>mower</b> <b>blade</b> oriented so that it rotates in a vertical plane.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} round of the semi-final, Beast of Bodmin faced Blade, which was {{equipped}} with a rotating <b>lawn</b> <b>mower</b> <b>blade.</b> Beast of Bodmin was able to take advantage of Blade's high ground clearance, levering its wheels off the ground and raising it onto its side with the tusk. In this orientation, Blade was unable to move. It faced Steg-O-Saw-Us for a place in the series final. Beast of Bodmin was comparatively sluggish and, after being repeatedly pushed across the arena by its opponent, Beast of Bodmin broke down whereas Steg-O-Saw-Us went on to finish 4th in the competition. This was the first time that the Roadblock team had failed to reach the series final. After series three, the team did not again appear on Robot Wars.|$|R
5000|$|At prestigious private school, Dartmoor Academy, the principal, Morgan Brinway {{is forcing}} the second-graders to study opera appreciation. Five feisty kids (leader Sonny, contraption making Loaf, movie loving Domino, {{sympathetic}} albeit tough Lucy, and the reluctant participating Witz), nicknamed the [...] "Stinkers" [...] by Mr. Brinway, are secretly skipping class to create chaos {{on the school}} grounds. Witz becomes the test pilot for a flying chair, one of Sonny's newest ideas. The Stinkers go to Groundskeeper Roy's shed and steal his leaf blower. Before that, they stole Mr. Brinway's desk chair. The Stinkers fail to notice that the leaf blower was not entirely duct taped onto the desk chair. When turned it on, the leaf blower flew off the contraption but left Witz sitting in the chair. The leaf blower was heading straight for Mr. Brinway's new convertible, but the leaf blower {{ran out of gas}} before it destroyed the car. Roy accidentally obliterates the car's side door with his <b>lawn</b> <b>mower</b> <b>blade.</b> Mr. Brinway warns the Stinkers they will be expelled if they mess up one more time, they soon rebel while trying to keep a low profile and are involved in even more misadventures.|$|R
50|$|Grass shears {{differ from}} pruning shears in being long-handled {{and having the}} handles at right-angles to the blades. They {{can be used to}} cut grass from a {{standing}} position. Two kinds are available: with the blades horizontal and with the blades vertical. Horizontal blades are used to remove grass which has not been cut by the <b>lawn</b> <b>mower,</b> while vertical <b>blades</b> are used for trimming the edges of a lawn.|$|R
40|$|This thesis will {{document}} {{and analyze the}} experience of {{two members of the}} Shear Genius team, Mr. Abdulrahman Hamid and Mr. Colin Wattigney, as they worked to complete the CME Senior Capstone Project. This team, under the leadership of CEO Ethan Veazey, developed the <b>Blade</b> Bandit, a <b>lawn</b> <b>mower</b> <b>blade</b> sharpening system conceptualized by Mr. Jacob Moorhead. Ms. Kristen Gaddis, Mr. Nick Rocco, and Ms. Allie Winters were also members of Shear Genius. The team members had educational backgrounds in the realms of engineering, business and accountancy. The combination of these disciplines allowed for the simulation of a real business group and helped prepare the team members for the situations that they would face as members of industry. After months of planning, designing, and redesigning, the Shear Genius team was able to develop a process in which a functional Blade Bandit could be produced quickly and consistently. The team gained vast amounts of experience and worked together as a cohesive unit to overcome the many obstacles that were faced. This thesis will describe iterations of the Blade Bandit, the business model used, and the changes made along the way. It will also provide insight into all decisions made {{over the course of the}} project...|$|R

The space between the forward ends of the elongated members and the forward end of the mower cowling is open and free from obstructions to permit the grass to be sucked upwardly for cutting by the <b>mower</b> <b>blade.</b> The elongated members have varying lengths to define an effective area substantially {{the same as the}} area defined by the unsharpened center portion of the <b>mower</b> <b>blade</b> when rotating so that the sharpened ends of the blade extend outwardly beyond the effective area of the guard means. The guard means is hinged to the mower cowling to permit convenient cleaning of the mower. An ignition interlock means is also connected to the guard...|$|R
