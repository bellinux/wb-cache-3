The show's first series ran for nine episodes. In June 2000, then Director-General of the BBC Greg Dyke pledged extra funding for BBC One, some of which was used for extra episodes of Holby City. The second and third series ran for 16 and 30 episodes respectively, with new episodes then airing {{on a weekly basis}} from the fourth series onwards. Series four to nine and eleven all ran for 52 episodes, while series ten ran for 53 episodes, {{including}} the stand-alone finale episode [...] "Mad World", set outside the hospital. All series from then on continued to consist of 52 episodes, with exception to the twelfth series, which consisted of 55 episodes in total. Young explained of the increase in series length: [...] "Longer runs allow you to develop really strong storylines for the regular characters. As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> volume with passion, it'll work." [...] The series reached its 500th episode on 13 April 2010.|$|E
500|$|Man on the Moon: The End of Day {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 71, based on 15 reviews. The Boston Globe praised the experimental {{quality of the}} album: [...] "It's spacey, adventurous, and ridiculously intriguing if only because it's so different". Complimenting Cudi's [...] "introspective persona, ear for melody, and eclectic taste in beats," [...] Entertainment Weekly music reviewer Simon Vozick-Levinson called him [...] "a hyped upstart who really does represent a promising new phase in the genre's evolution." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic called it [...] "a soul searcher [...] may require more patience than your everyday debut", but [...] "perfects the futuristic bleak-beat hip-hop Kanye purposed a year earlier, and rewards the listener with every tripped-out return." [...] Greg Kot, writing in the Chicago Tribune, believed that the album {{had the potential to}} turn heads as well as [...] "bum-rush the charts." [...] Slant Magazines Paul Schrodt wrote that the album attempts to be [...] "both a bigger pop platform and indie credibility", and felt that Cudi's verses [...] "are too good to ignore" [...] so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not take them too seriously. Ann Power of the Los Angeles Times called Man on the Moon a [...] "standout release" [...] in spite of [...] "Cudi's voice". Billboard magazine's Michael Menachem said that the album is [...] "anything but a traditional hip-hop recording" [...] and that Cudi's [...] "delivery is confident in a poetic and artful way". David Bevan of The A.V. Club said that, despite its filler, Cudi's [...] "thick layer of open, intense self-loathing is a clever way of unifying Man On The Moon as pure mood piece, a stream-of-consciousness pop voyage that’s more Phil Collins than rap." ...|$|E
2500|$|At this point, Cleon and Demosthenes {{declined}} {{to push the}} attack further, preferring to take as many Spartans as they could prisoner. [...] An Athenian herald offered the Spartans a chance to surrender, and the Spartans, throwing down their shields, agreed at least to negotiate. [...] Cleon and Demosthenes met with the Spartan commander Styphon (Styphon had initially been the third in command, but Epitadas had been killed and his first successor was severely wounded and had been left for dead). [...] Styphon requested to send a herald to the mainland to seek advice; the Athenians refused to allow any of the trapped men to leave, but permitted as many heralds from the mainland as were desired to pass back and forth. [...] Several messengers did so, the last of whom left Styphon with the message [...] "The Spartans order you to make your decision yourselves, so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> nothing dishonorable." [...] Styphon and his men, with no hope of victory or escape, surrendered. [...] Of the 440 Spartans who had crossed over to Sphacteria, 292 survived to surrender; of these, 120 were men of the elite Spartiate class.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his early}} years at Harvard, Lake {{continued}} to be active with The Churchmen's Union, an Anglican society {{for the advancement of}} liberal religious thought. [...] He and Foakes-Jackson lent their support to H. D. A. Major in organizing a conference of Modern Churchmen (which continues till this day). [...] The first was held at Ripon, Yorkshire, 3–6 July 1914. [...] Foakes-Jackson and Lake delivered an attack on Liberal Protestantism. [...] Lake said that the task of the liberal Christian is [...] "not to go back upon the inherited Catholic doctrines of the Church, but to apply and to expand them, because we see that in the end they are true so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not limit them." [...] The most famous of the conferences was the one held at Girton College, Cambridge, 8–15 August 1921. [...] Its subject was [...] "Christ and the Creeds" [...] and it was planned as a response to Lake's publication of the first volume of The Beginnings of Christianity. [...] Lake did not attend, so it was left to Foakes-Jackson to defend their positions. [...] He explained that he and Lake believed that the Jesus whom the early Church preached was not [...] "a character of singular charm and beauty during his life on earth, but a Risen Saviour who was expected to come speedily to judge the quick and the dead." [...] Liberal Protestants, he argued, were preaching a Christ who had no historical foundation. [...] From 1915 to 1931 Lake served as one of vice presidents of the union; however, after 1927 he began to part company with English Modernism and in 1932 he wrote to have his name removed from the list of vice presidents.|$|E
