5000|$|The [...] of {{a muscle}} is the bone, {{typically}} proximal, which has greater mass {{and is more}} stable during a contraction than a muscle's insertion. [...] For example, with the latissimus dorsi muscle, the origin site is the torso, and the insertion is the arm. When this muscle contracts, normally the arm moves due to having less mass than the torso. This is the case when grabbing objects lighter than the body, as in the typical use of a <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down machine. This can be reversed however, such as in a chin up where the torso moves up to meet the arm.|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze the {{relationships}} between dry land strength and power measurements with swimming performance. Ten male national level swimmers (age: 14. 9 ± 0. 74 years, body mass: 60. 0 ± 6. 26 kg, height: 171. 9 ± 6. 26, 100 m long course front crawl performance: 59. 9 ± 1. 87 s) volunteered as subjects. Height and Work were estimated for CMJ. Mean power in the propulsive phase was assessed for squat, bench press (concentric phase) and <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down back. Mean force production was evaluated through 30 s maximal effort tethered swimming in front crawl using whole body, arms only and legs only. Swimming velocity was calculated from a maximal bout of 50 m front crawl. Height of CMJ did not correlate with any of the studied variables. There were positive and moderate-strong associations between the work during CMJ and mean propulsive power in squat with tethered forces during whole body and legs only swimming. Mean propulsive power of bench press and <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down presented positive and moderate-strong relationships with mean force production in whole body and arms only. Swimming performance is related with mean power of <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down back. So, <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down back is the most related dry land test with swimming performance; bench press with force production in water arms only; and work during CM...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the {{precision}} of the OMNI-RES scale to predict energy cost (EC) at low intensity in four resistance exercises (RE). 17 male recreational body builders (age = 26. 6 ± 4. 9 years; height = 177. 7 ± 0. 1 cm; body weight = 79. 0 ± 11. 1 kg and percent body fat = 10. 5 ± 4. 6 %) served as subjects. Initially tests to determine 1 RM for four resistance exercises (bench press, half squat, <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down and triceps extension) were administered. Subjects also performed resistance exercise at 12, 16, 20, and 24 % of 1 RM at a rate of 40 bpm until volitional exhaustion. Oxygen uptake (VO 2) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) using the OMNI-RES were obtained during and after all RE. EC was calculated using VO 2 and the caloric values of VO 2 for non-protein RER. Regression analyses were performed for every RE, using EC as the dependent and RPE as the predictor variable. The triceps extension, <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down and bench press, RPE correlated strongly with EC (R> 0. 97) and predicted EC with a error of less than 0. 2 kcal. min- 1. In conclusion, RPE using the OMNI-RES scale can be considered as an accurate indicator of EC in the bench press, <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down and triceps extension performed by recreational bodybuilders, provided lower intensities are used (up to 24 % of 1 -RM) and provided each set of exercise is performed for the maximal sustainable duration.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the effects of upper body strength training on work economy and muscle O 2 saturation (SmO 2) during prolonged double poling exercise. Twentynine national level cross-country skiers were assigned to either a group with added strength training (STR; n= 19) or a control group (CON; n= 8). Strength tests consisted of 1 RM in <b>lat</b> pulldown, bench <b>pulls</b> and triceps press. Conditioning tests were split into 4 days of testing (2 pre, and 2 post), where day 1 and 3 consisted of a strength test, lactate profile test and VO 2 max test, while day 2 and 4 consisted of a 90 -minute continuous double poling test, a lactate profile test and VO 2 max test. During all tests, measurements of VO 2, HR, La-, RER, and RPE was tested. NIRS was measured on 3 muscles simultaneously (m. triceps brachii, m. latissimus dorsi and m. vastus lateralis), and was mounted directly on top of the muscles, attached with adhesive cloth and a bandage. The strength training performed by STR consisted of three upper body exercises, <b>lat</b> pulldown, latissimus <b>pulls</b> and triceps press, executed periodically over 8 weeks or a total of 19 - 24 sessions. STR increased in all three exercises (all p< 0. 01), while no change occurred in CON. Both STR and CON showed a reduction in oxygen consumption during the 90 min test from pre to post (p< 0. 05), while only CON had an increase in RER from pre to post test (p< 0. 05). No changes in La-, HR and RPE was found. NIRS showed no significant changes from pre to post test. However, STR group showed a stable development in SmO 2 during the 90 -minute test from pre to post, while the CON group had a more negative development from pre to post test, reflecting the RER results to some degree. The study concluded that strength training had no positive effect on any endurance related variables during prolonged double poling, but also no negative effect either. Only the CON group had a increase in RER, which indicates an increase in effort even when all other variables in the test stayed the same. SmO 2 showed similar tendencies, although not significant, that the CON group had more negative development in SmO 2 from pre to post test. This study showed that added strength training not always gives an increase in work economy during prolonged double poling at moderate intensity, and that strength training might participate in preventing negative effects to RER and SmO 2 caused by endurance training alone...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the accumulated oxygen deficit (AOD) method to assess the energy cost in resistance exercises (RE). The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the aerobic and anaerobic energy release during resistance exercises performed at 80 % 1 -RM in four exercises (half squat, bench press, triceps extension and <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down), as well as the accuracy of its estimation. The sample comprised 14 men (age = 26. 6 ± 4. 9 years; height = 177. 7 ± 0. 1 cm; body mass = 79. 0 ± 11. 1 kg; and estimated fat mass = 10. 5 ± 4. 6 %). Test and re-test of 1 -RM were applied to every exercise. Low-intensity bouts at 12, 16, 20, and 24 % of 1 -RM were conducted. Energy cost was then extrapolated to 80 % 1 -RM exhaustive bout and relative energy contribution were assessed. By utilizing the AOD method, the results of the present study suggest a great proportion of anaerobic metabolism during exercise at 80 % 1 -RM in the four RE that were analyzed: Bench press = 77, 66 ± 6, 95 %; Half squat = 87, 44 ± 6, 45 %; Triceps extension = 63, 91 ± 9, 22 %; <b>Lat</b> <b>pull</b> down = 71, 99 ± 13, 73 %. The results of the present study suggest that AOD during resistance exercises presents a pattern that does not match the reports in the literature for other types of exercise. The accuracy of the total energy demand estimation at 80 % 1 -RM was acceptable in the Bench press, in the Triceps extension and in the <b>Lat</b> <b>pull</b> down, but no in the Half squat.

Thirty healthy males (n = 15) and females (n = 15) who experienced at least 3 months of continuous resistance training during the last 2 years aged 18 - 35 years volunteered to participate in the study. The 1 RM for the biceps curl, <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down, bench press, leg curl, hip flexion, triceps extension, shoulder press, low row, leg extension, hip extension, leg press and squat were measured twice by a trained professional using a standard published protocol. Biceps curl, <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down, bench press, leg curl, hip flexion, and squat 1 RM's were measured on the first visit, then 48 hours later, subjects returned for their second visit. During their second visit, 1 RM of triceps extension, shoulder press, low row, leg extension, hip extension, and leg press were measured. One week from the second visit, participants completed the 1 RM testing as previously done during the first and second visits. The third and fourth visits were separated by 48 hours as well. All four visits to the laboratory were at the same time of day. A high intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC > 0. 91) was found for all exercises, independent of gender and muscle group size or location, however there was a significant interaction for muscle group location (upper body vs. lower body) in females (p < 0. 027).

30|$|Exercise {{consisted}} of three different exercises to mimic regular training for improving fitness levels among team sport athletes, including repeated sprint exercise, resistance exercise, and drop jump. We selected this protocol because all exercises are commonly used for daily training on sport fields. For the repeated sprint exercise, the subjects completed 10 [*]×[*] 6  s all-out sprint separated with 30  s rest between the sprints using an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer (Power Max VIII; Konami Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The resistance of pedaling was set at 7.5 % of each body weight. Resistance exercise {{consisted of}} four exercises: three exercises for upper body muscles (chest press, <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down, shoulder press) and an exercise for lower limb muscles (bilateral leg press) using weight stack machines (Life Fitness, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Each exercise involved 10 repetitions, with five sets for chest press and <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down and three sets for shoulder press and bilateral leg press. The resistance was set as 75 % of 1 RM for each exercise. The subjects rested for 2  min between sets and exercises. Before the training session in each trial, the subjects performed warm-up sets comprising 10 repetitions at 50 % of the 1 RM and stretching of the major muscle groups targeted by the exercises. For drop jump, the subjects completed 5 [*]×[*] 10 drop jumps (50 jumps in total) from a height of 40  cm. All jumps were performed with placing hands on hips. After landing, they are requested to pause at a squatting position, with hand on hips and knees flexed to approximately 90 ° and subsequently conducted vertical jump with maximal effort [6, 22]. Each exercise session including repeated sprint exercise, resistance exercise, and drop jump lasted 60  min. The exercise session was repeated twice in the morning (9 : 00 – 10 : 00, Ex 1) and afternoon (14 : 00 - 15 : 00, Ex 2) under supervision by laboratory staff.|$|E

Although previous reports showed that resistance training is feasible and effective, we hypothesized that a more intense exercise program would also be feasible, but more beneficial than low- to moderate-intensity training programs. We aimed {{to examine the effects of}} an exercise program combining high-intensity resistance exercises and moderate-intensity aerobic exercises in young patients undergoing treatment for ALL. A quasi-experimental study was conducted. The patients (n = 6; 5 - 16 years of age) underwent a 12 -week intra-hospital training program involving high-intensity strength exercises and aerobic exercise at 70 % of the peak oxygen consumption. At baseline and after 12 weeks, we assessed sub-maximal strength (10 repetition-maximum), quality of life and possible adverse effects. A significant improvement was observed in the sub maximal strength for bench press (71 %), <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down (50 %), leg press (73 %) and leg extension (64 %) as a result of the training (p < 0. 01). The parents' evaluations of their children's quality of life revealed an improvement in fatigue and general quality of life, but the children's self-reported quality of life was not changed. No adverse effects occurred.

30|$|Each {{exercise}} program consisted of 3 supervised exercise sessions per week that were completed between Monday and Friday. Prior {{to the beginning}} of each {{exercise program}} participants completed one orientation exercise session to introduce them to the exercise equipment and determine the appropriate exercise intensity. Aerobic exercise sessions were performed on a treadmill (True Fitness Technology, St. Louis, MO) and lasted 60  min, including a 10 -min warm-up and 5 -min cool-down. The warm-up consisted of walking at 3.5 mph at 0  % incline. Following the warm-up, participants exercised for 45  min at an intensity between 60 and 75  % of their maximum heart rate, which was determined via a graded exercise test. Heart rate was recorded continuously throughout the entire exercise session via heart rate telemetry (Polar RS 400, Polar Electro Inc., Lake Success, NY). Every 5 – 10  min laboratory staff verified that participants were exercising at the appropriate intensity and treadmill speed and incline were adjusted if necessary. The cool-down consisted of walking at a self-selected pace at 0  % incline. Resistance exercise sessions consisted of the same warm-up and cool down as described for aerobic exercise. The resistance exercise routine consisted of 10 machine-based exercises targeting the whole body. Specifically, participants completed 3 sets with 8 – 12 repetitions of 5 upper body exercises (bench press, <b>lat</b> <b>pull,</b> shoulder press, biceps curl, triceps extension), 3 lower body exercises (leg press, leg extension, leg curl) and 2 core exercises (abdominal crunches, back extension). Resistance for individual exercises was increased when participants completed 3 sets of 12 repetitions on 2 consecutive exercise days in order to adjust for adaptations in response to the training.

Oxidative stress is a condition in which the reactive oxygen species production exceeds the antioxidant system capacity to neutralize these peroxidants. In these situations, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids are damaged. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to determine the effects of acute resistance exercise (RE) on 8 -hydroxy- 2 ’-deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG), marker of DNA oxidation. Methods: In this quasi-experimental research, nine resistances trained (RT) and nine untrained (UT) men were randomly selected. All subjects performed a RE protocol including 4 sets of the bench press, leg press, sited bar shoulder press, arm curls and <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down exercises using high intensity (80 % of 1 RM). Blood draws occurred before and immediately after exercise and urine samples were collected before, immediately after, 3 h after and 24 h after resistance exercise for the measurement of plasma lactate and urinary 8 -OHdG excretion. Results: Urinary 8 -OHdG concentrations were significantly lower at post and 24 h post exercise in RT compared with UT (P< 0. 05). The concentration of 8 -OHdG was significantly elevated post, 3 h post and 24 h post exercise in UT as compared with pre exercise status (P< 0. 05). However, 8 -OHdG was significantly elevated 24 h post exercise in RT as compared with pre exercise status (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The findings of the present study indicated that oxidative DNA damage was lower in bodybuilding athletes compared to the untrained. This may be due to regular resistance training status in athletes and it is possible that antioxidant capacity is improved in athletes due to performing regular resistance training...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{are the major}} cause of mortality in all over the world. We evaluated the effect of eight weeks combined training on some cardiovascular risk factors in sedentary healthy middle aged men. Methods: 24 sedentary healthy, middle aged male subjects (age: 63. 4 ± 2. 1 years, BMI: 23. 1 ± 2. 5 kg/m 2) participated in this study. Subject {{were randomly assigned to}} training (T, n= 12) and control (C, n= 12) groups. T group, underwent one training session per day, 3 days/week, for 8 weeks. Training program included both aerobic and resistance exercise. Aerobic training consisted in 20 min running on a treadmill at 60 - 70 % HRR for each session. Resistance training consisted in 10 movement stations e. g., leg flex-extension-press, squat, <b>lat</b> <b>pull,</b> chest press, cross arm, biceps-triceps with halter and sit up in 2 sets with 10 repetitions that performed at 70 % 1 RM. Before and after combined aerobic/resistance training, all subject underwent body fat assessment and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX). Venous blood samples were also drawn for determination of plasma levels of adiponectin, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and homocysteine. Data were analyzed using repeated measure test (ANOVA). P< 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Result: Plasma levels of IL- 6, homocysteine and body fat were significantly reduced and adiponectine was significantly increased in T, whereas all the variables did not change significantly in C. Vo 2 max  increase significantly only in T group (20. 41 ± 2. 93 vs 23. 25 ± 2. 00) and in control group (19. 91 ± 2. 84 vs 20. 08 ± 3. 20).

40|$|During circuit weight {{training}} (CWT), workloads, index of intensity {{as well as}} estimation of energy expenditure (EE) have been under estimated. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe and evaluate physiological variables and gender related differences, including intensity prediction and EE, during CWT at different intensities. Twenty six subjects were assessed in a CWT, fourteen men and twelve women. The CWT program was performed at six different intensities, 40 %, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 80 % and 85 % of 15 RM. Seven exercises made up the circuit: sitting bench press, leg press, <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down, shoulder press, hamstring curl, biceps curl, and triceps cable push downs. A polar heart rate monitor and a portable metabolic system were used to measure heart rate (HR), intensity measured relative to the HR reserve, cardiorespiratory variables, EE and EE relative to muscle mass (EEMM). Differences between genders were observed at the following variables: HR, intensity measured relative to the HR reserve (in percentage), VO 2, VCO 2, VE, RER, aerobic EE and EEMM. The EE was significantly higher in men during the six intensities, but differences did not exist for EEMM from 70 % to 85 %. In addition HR, load and body weight were used to predict intensity and two gender specific equations were obtained for men and women [I (%) = 57. 265 + 0. 512 HR - 0. 696 HRmax + 1. 035 Loadavg + 0. 188 Body Weight (R 2 = 0. 92; SEE= 4. 9 %) for men; I (%) = 4. 036 + 0. 412 HR% + 1. 667 Loadavg (R 2 = 0. 79; SEE= 7. 7 %) for women]. Thus, we conclude that gender related differences are present during CWT for EE, even when expressed relative to muscle mass, in addition HR, work load and body weight can estimate the intensity during CWT...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that hypertrophy gains is greater in upper body compared to lower body, however, there is no consensus that muscular strength gains are greater in upper body than in lower body. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to compare the strength gains between knee extensors and elbow flexors in response to similar resistance training regimens. Fifty five untrained young women (age: 21. 6 ± 2. 9 years, weight: 58. 3 ± 9. 0 kg and height: 163. 6 ± 7. 5 cm (Mean±SD)) participated in the study as volunteers. Resistance training was performed twice a week for  10 weeks. All subjects performed three sets of 8 - 12 maximum repetitions for leg press, knee flexion, <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down and bench press exercises. Unilateral knee extensors and elbow flexors peak torque (PT) were measured before and after the training period by performing two sets of four repetitions at 60 °s- 1, on an isokinetic dynamometer. There were significant increases in PT for both elbow flexors (11. 74 % [8. 0, 17. 7], p 0. 05). However, there was no correlation between gains in knee extensors and elbow flexors PT. The analysis of knee extensors PT lead to the formation of two clusters groups: 1) High responders (n= 10) : 28. 29 ± 8. 74 % and 2) Low-responders (n= 37) : 7. 94 ± 5. 95 %. Both groups had significant increases in knee extensors PT, however, increases in the high responders were higher than in low responders (p< 0. 05). These results suggest that upper- and lower body muscles present similar strength gains after similar resistance training regimens in untrained young women, although individual muscle response may vary in upper and lower body muscles.

For each group, two exercises were randomly assigned and on different days, they performed four bouts of 5 -min constant-intensity {{for each of the}} two assigned exercises: 12 %, 16 %, 20 % and 24 % 1 -RM. Later, the subjects performed exhaustive bouts at 80 % 1 -RM in the same two exercises. The mean values of VO 2 at the last 30 s of exercise at 12, 16, 20 and 24 % 1 -RM bouts were plotted against relative intensity (% 1 -RM) in a simple linear regression mode. The regressions were then used to predict O 2 demand for the higher intensity (80 % 1 -RM). Energy cost rose linearly with exercise intensity in every exercise with the lowest mean values were found in biceps curl and the highest in half squat exercise (p< 0. 001). Half squat exercise presented significant (p< 0. 001) higher values of energy cost in all intensities, when compared with the remaining exercises. This study revealed that low-intensity resistance exercise provides energy cost comprised between 3 and 10 kcal∙min- 1. Energy cost rose past 20 kcal∙min- 1 at 80 % 1 -RM in leg exercise. In addition, at 80 % 1 -RM, it was found that upper body exercises are less anaerobic than lower-body exercises...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of intensity of an acute bout of resistance exercise on glycemic response, nine healthy college-aged (23. 9 ?? 2. 3 years) males participated in two separate bouts (65 %, 85 % of 1 repetition maximum) of resistance exercise in random order. Each subject took part in three laboratory visits that were separated by a minimum of 72 hours. Subjects were given a baseline oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) followed by a 1 repetition maximum strength test to assess baseline glucose tolerance and strength in the squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, and <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down. Following the baseline testing, subjects were randomly assigned to either a 65 % or 85 % one repetition maximum workout that was immediately followed by an OGTT and then were tested again at the opposite intensity. Each exercise was performed for three sets to failure with 2 minutes of rest between each set. Overall {{there were no significant differences}} between the baseline OGTT, post- 65 % exercise OGTT, and the post- 85 % exercise OGTT at any of the 5 blood sampling periods. In all five lifts more work was performed in the 65 % exercise session with 26 % less total work being done in the 85 % exercise session. It can be suggested that the less dramatic glycemic response of the post- 65 % exercise group compared to that of the post- 85 % exercise is a product of the greater amount of work done in the 65 % one repetition maximum strength exercise session. The greater work would have also led to a greater glycogen depletion which would have stimulated muscles to take up blood-borne glucose to a greater degree to replenish the depleted glycogen stores. The only way this can truly be evaluated however is to calculate the area under the curve to look at the entire 120 minute period rather than each time point individually. CSU, Chic...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{demonstration}} project {{was to assess the}} compliance of crewmembers to perform exercise countermeasures similar to those planned for use during stays aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and to assess the out-comes of performing these countermeasures. During the 60 -day Phase IIa project, crewmembers exercised for six consecutive days alternating between aerobic and resistive exercise, and rested on the seventh day. On the aerobic exercise days, subjects exercised for 30 minutes on an electronically braked cycle ergometer using an interval protocol. On the resistive exercise days, crewmembers performed five major multijoint resistive exercises (bench press, seated press, <b>lat</b> <b>pull,</b> squats, and heel raises) in a concentric-only mode, targeting those muscle groups and bones that are believed to be most severely affected by space flight. Subjects performed maximal efforts with each repetition. Both exercise protocols were well tolerated by the subjects, demonstrated by 98 % compliance with the aerobic exercise prescription and 91 % adherence to the resistive exercise prescription. After 60 days, the crewmembers improved their peak aerobic capacity by an average of 7 %. Strength gains during all exercises were noted. During the 91 -day Phase III project, the frequency of the exercise countermea-sures was increased to include both aerobic and resistive exercises each day for six days, with rest on the seventh day. For aerobic exercise, the cycle protocol was performed three days/week similar to the Phase IIa project. However a steady-state treadmill protocol was added on the remaining three exercise days. The same resist-ance exercise protocol was performed as in Phase IIa, except that the upper- and lower-body exercises were divided and performed on separate days. Three of the four subjects tolerated the aerobic exercise training well. One crewmember devel-oped knee pain in the final third of the chamber test and did not perform further cycle or lower-body resistive exercises {{for the remainder of the}} study. The thre...|$|E

METHODS: Thirty-four men/women with T 2 DM (age 57 ± 7 years and body mass index 34. 9 ± 4. 2 kg m(- 2)) {{were randomly assigned to}} the ingestion of a HP meal (860 kJ, 21 g protein, 0. 7 g fat, 29. 6 g carbohydrate) either immediately prior to RT or at least 2 h following RT. All participants followed a 16 -week, energy-restricted (6 - 7 MJ day(- 1)), HP diet (carbohydrate : protein : fat 43 : 33 : 22) and participated in supervised RT (3 day week(- 1)). Outcomes were assessed pre- and postintervention at 16 weeks. RESULTS: There was an overall reduction in bodyweight (- 11. 9 ± 6. 1 kg), fat mass (- 10. 0 ± 4. 4 kg), fat-free mass (- 1. 9 ± 3. 1 kg), waist circumference (- 12. 1 ± 5. 3 cm), REE (- 742 ± 624 kJ day(- 1)), glucose (- 1. 9 ± 1. 7 mmol l(- 1)), insulin (- 6. 1 ± 6. 7 mU l(- 1)) and glycosylated haemoglobin (- 1. 1 ± 0. 1 %), p ≤ 0. 01 time for all variables, with no difference between groups (p ≥ 0. 41 group effect). Strength improved and cardiometabolic risk factors were reduced similarly in both groups; single repetition maximum chest press 11. 0 ± 8. 7 kg, single repetition maximum <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down 9. 9 ± 6. 0 kg, total cholesterol - 0. 6 ± 0. 5 mmol l(- 1), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol - 0. 1 ± 0. 2 mmol l(- 1), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol - 0. 3 ± 0. 5 mmol l(- 1), triglycerides - 0. 6 ± 0. 7 mmol l(- 1), blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) - 13 ± 10 /- 7 ± 7 mmHg (p ≤ 0. 04 time effect, p ≥ 0. 24 group effect). CONCLUSION: A HP, energy-restricted diet with RT was effective in improving glycaemic control, body composition, strength and cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight/obese patients with T 2 DM irrespective of altering the timing of protein ingestion relative to RT.

40|$|Increases {{in chronic}} {{inflammation}} and decreases in muscular strength and aerobic capacity occur as individuals age. Additionally, vitamin D {{levels in the}} blood have been positively associated with increases in strength {{and lower levels of}} inflammatory cytokines. Individuals who have participated in a training study {{may be more likely to}} continue structured exercise programs and thus maintain their strength, aerobic capacity and inflammatory levels. Subjects from previous studies were recruited to visit the lab so that measurements could be taken for inflammation, strength, aerobic capacity, and 25 -hydroxy vitamin D. Comparisons were made over 7 year (G 7 Y), 4 year (G 4 Y), and 3 year (G 3 Y) time periods. CRP did not increase over 3 years among subjects who remained physically active. There was a positive correlation (r=. 47, p 3 ̆c. 05) between vitamin D and 8 RM seated row. G 4 Y subjects were able maintain their strength for 8 RM leg press and 8 RM chest press. However, 8 RM seated row and 8 RM <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down decreased significantly (p 3 ̆c. 01, p=. 01, respectively). There was only a significant increase in 8 RM chest press for G 7 Y. BMI increased significantly (p 3 ̆c. 005) for G 3 Y, but not G 7 Y or G 4 Y; however, body fat decreased for both G 4 Y (p 3 ̆c. 005) and G 3 Y (p 3 ̆c. 001). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased for G 7 Y (p 3 ̆c. 05) and systolic blood pressure decreased for G 4 Y (p 3 ̆c. 01). These results show that remaining active appears to blunt inflammatory increases that occur with age. Additionally, participating in an exercise training study may educate subjects on how to properly exercise in order to allow them to maintain strength and aerobic measures which literature has shown are expected to decline. No significant decreases in physical activity in any group may have contributed to decreases in body fat percentage, no change in BMI for G 7 Y and G 4 Y, and minimal decreases in strength. Different seasonal time-points may have had an effect on the level of 25 -hydroxy vitamin D and associated lack of significance when correlated with all variables except seated row. Blood pressure may have decreased as a result of medications prescribed after their participation in the original study. No subjects reported taking blood pressure medication in the original study, but eleven people were taking medications to control blood pressure at follow up in 2007. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and Purpose: In chronic {{heart failure}} (CHF), {{exercise}} rehabilitation {{results in a}} reduced risk of mortality, decreased disease severity, and increased functional ability. Resistance training {{is an important component}} of cardiac rehabilitation; however, an optimal training velocity that produces physiological and functional benefits at minimal perceived exertion and cardiovascular stress has yet to be identified. CHF patients need to be very efficient and perform the exercise that will give them the greatest benefits because of their poor exercise tolerance and increased risk of cardiovascular complications during exercise. In older populations, high velocity resistance training results in greater improvements in functional ability than low velocity resistance training. The use of high velocity resistance training in patients with CHF has yet to be examined; however it may enhance higher velocity activities of daily living while using a lower training load. The lower load associated with high velocity training may be less strenuous and result in lower cardiovascular stress, whilst maintaining a relatively similar power output compared to traditional low-velocity training. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the acute cardiovascular responses and perceived exertion of high and low velocity resistance exercises. Methods and Measures: 6 male and 1 female patients with systolic heart failure (CHF NYHA Class I-III) were recruited to perform two separate, randomly assigned exercise sessions. These sessions consisted of 5 exercises (hack squat, chest press, knee flexion, <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down and knee extension); one with a low velocity of contraction (3 second concentric phase: 3 second eccentric phase at 50 % of the slow velocity 1 -RM) and one with a high velocity (1 second concentric phase: 3 second eccentric phase at 50 % of the high velocity 1 -RM). During both sessions, heart rate, blood pressure, and a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were obtained after the completion of each exercise. Results: Despite a similar relative mechanical load, the high velocity workout produced significantly lower systolic blood pressure (121. 2 vs. 132. 8 mmHg), mean arterial pressure (87. 8 vs. 93. 5), and RPE (3. 7 vs. 4. 8) than the low velocity workout (p< 0. 05). The high velocity workout was not significantly different from the low velocity workout for heart rate, rate pressure product and diastolic blood pressure. Conclusion: We conclude that the high velocity workout produces more favourable blood pressure responses to resistance training in patients with CHF than the low velocity workout and may be used to enhance functional outcomes in cardiac rehabilitation programs...|$|E

The 10 RM test was made in two days (test and retest) and was in the following order: bench press (BP), leg-press 45 º (LP) and biceps curl (BC). The first group trained with 1 min rest interval, and the other one with 3 min rest interval between sets. The total training consisted in three sessions per week, realized in alterned days (24 sessions). The subjects did three sets of each exercise in the respective intervals, and only after three sets in the same exercise, they go on in the next exercise. The exercise order was: BP, LP, BC, hack machine, <b>lat</b> <b>pull</b> down, abdominals and triceps pull down. A one-way ANOVA was used and a Tukey post hoc test was performed where indicated (p< 0. 05) to verify the interval rest effects on the three measures. No significant differences between the 10 RM loads were observed when compared the different rest intervals. We conclude that independent of rest interval, no significant differences were observed in 10 RM loads in RE during eight weeks.
