The highway was an addition to the original system designed by the New Jersey Commissioner of Public Roads in 1916, which started with thirteen state highway highways. The portion from Hoboken to Fort Lee was never officially taken over by the New Jersey State Highway Department, as when the 1927 state highway renumbering occurred, the alignment of Route 18-N south of Fort Lee had already wiped, but the designation was retained from the Fort Lee to the state line in Alpine. Route 18-N was one of four -N suffixes retained in the 1927 renumbering, however, Route 18-N was the first to be eliminated, when the new New Jersey Route 1 was realigned onto Route 18-N in a minor change in 1929. This former alignment of Route 18-N through the Palisades Cliffs has since been abandoned and was part of the <b>Long</b> <b>Path,</b> a hiking trail and scenic overlook as Old Route 9W until the <b>Long</b> <b>Path</b> was realigned on April 1, 2009.|$|E
