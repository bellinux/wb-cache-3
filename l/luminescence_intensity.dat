40|$|Gas {{exchange}} and plant luminescence (delayed light emission) {{of a single}} red kidney bean leaf undergoing synchronous oscillations in gas exchange were recorded and analyzed. Introduction of 1. 1 microliter per liter SO 2 during these oscillations produced increases in plant luminescence that, when averaged over {{a portion of the}} leaf, oscillated in phase with the gas exchange oscillations. However, examination of a video record of the plant luminescence showed not only that <b>luminescence</b> <b>intensities</b> tended to be localized within discrete areas of the leaf, but that the time-dependence of <b>luminescence</b> <b>intensities</b> within these regions varied considerably from the period, amplitude, and often phase of the overall gas exchange oscillations.

The optical bistability is intrinsic to Cs 3 Y 2 Br 9 : 10 % Yb 3 + and not a result of an external feedback. Lowering the temperature to 11 K strongly enhances the all‐optical switching behavior. The switching on VIS cooperative upconversion and NIR luminescence transitions occurs simultaneously and with opposite polarity reflecting the competition of both emission processes. On/Off switching ratios of up to 4. 8 and 1. 7 were observed for VIS and NIR <b>luminescence</b> <b>intensities.</b> Using NIR <b>luminescence</b> spectroscopy, differences in the internal sample temperature of up to 7 K were found between the upper and lower branches of the hystereses. A two‐level density‐matrix model is developed which includes ground‐ and excited‐state interactions and shows that the intrinsic bistability due to a local field different from the external field is strongly amplified by the nonlinear cooperative upconversion process. Alternatively, a rate‐equation model is presented which takes the multilevel nature of the ions into account but is more phenomenological in nature. Formally, the two models are shown to be equivalent, and they qualitatively explain all major experimental observations. It is found both theoretically and experimentally that increasing the coupling within Yb 3 + dimers and/or decreasing energy migration through the Yb 3 + lattice enhances switching and renders it easier to observe intrinsic optical bistability. © 1996 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

Whole core treatment with concentrated reagent grade NaOCl at pH = 9 significantly increased <b>luminescence</b> <b>intensities,</b> reduced the scatter in spectral ratios, revealed clear seasonality in the obscured tissue layer and removed (in) organic patchy contaminants throughout coral cores. Acidic agents (H 2 O 2 and HNO 3) caused severe dissolution of the aragonite skeleton and strongly affected the luminescence signature. Meanwhile, NaOCl did not affect absolute values and seasonal amplitudes in delta O- 58, delta C- 13 and some trace element ratios. Treatment with reagent grade NaOCl revealed seasonal amplitudes for Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca in the tissue layer, and strongly improved Ba/Ca results. We show that a non-skeletal barium phase can be present in coral segments and suggest that the associated Ba/Ca-spikes may have resulted from anoxia, sulfate reduction, dissolution and re-precipitation of extra crystalline barite (BaSO 4) in a redox front. Based on our findings we conclude that the use of an appropriate standardized cleaning protocol prior to analysis is recommended to reduce potential sources of errors and allow for accurate cross-comparison of coral records analyzed at different laboratories...|$|R
