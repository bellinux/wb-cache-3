40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} a debate between Hawtrey, Hicks and Keynes {{concerning}} {{the capacity of the}} central bank to influence the short-term and the <b>long-term</b> <b>rates</b> of interest. Both Hawtrey and Keynes considered the central bank’s ability to influence short-term rates of interest. However, they do not put the same emphasis on the study of the <b>long-term</b> <b>rates</b> of interest. According to Keynes, <b>long-term</b> <b>rates</b> are influenced by future expected short-term rates (1930, 1936), whereas for Hawtrey (1932, 1937, 1938), <b>long-term</b> <b>rates</b> are more dependent on the business cycle. Short-term rates do not have much effect on <b>long-term</b> <b>rates</b> according to Hawtrey.

50|$|Despite the Taylor rule, some researchers, Bernanke and Gertler for example, had {{difficulty}} in their empirical studies identifying significant effects of interest rate through {{the costs of}} capital. Another issue economists have is {{with the assumption that}} monetary policy has its strongest influence on short-term interest rates, such as the federal funds rate. Since this rate is an overnight rate, monetary policy has a relatively weaker impact on the real <b>long-term</b> <b>rate</b> and hence on the purchases of durable assets. Finally, this mechanism neglects the credit business of the banking system.|$|E

At Penn, Phelps's research focused mainly on the link between employment, wage setting and inflation, leading to his influential 1968 paper [...] "Money-Wage Dynamics and Labor Market Equilibrium." [...] The research contributed important insights in the microeconomics of the Phillips curve, including the role of expectations (in the form of adaptive expectations) and imperfect information {{in the setting of}} wages and prices. It also introduced the concept of the natural rate of unemployment and argued that labor market equilibrium is independent of the rate of inflation tand and so is no long run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation. That, if accurate, would have the crucial implication that the Keynesian policy of demand management has only [...] effects and so cannot be used to control the <b>long-term</b> <b>rate</b> of unemployment in the economy. In January 1969, Phelps organized a conference at Penn in support of the research on the microfoundations of inflation and employment determination. The conference papers were published the next year in a book that had a strong and lasting influence; it became known as the [...] "Phelps volume". Along with his research on the Phillips curve, Phelps also collaborated with other economists on research regarding economic growth, the effects of monetary and fiscal policy, and optimal population growth.|$|E

Short- and long-run curves for both systems are compared and {{it is found that}} the country who prefers to inflate less than the world tends to adopt the floating exchange rate system. When we consider the interest-induced international capital flows, the Phillips curve for a country under the floating exchange rate system shifts down as the short-term interest rate increases. This is beneficial to the economy while the higher interest rate brings costs; interest payments to foreigners, and less economic growth if the <b>long-term</b> <b>rate</b> is raised accordingly. By equalizing the marginal benefit and marginal cost of the higher interest rate policy, we can find the optimum interest rate. Empirically, we found that the Japanese optimum rate was 14. 1 %, the <b>long-term</b> <b>rate</b> being kept constant. The cost of lower economic growth was prohibitive to allow the <b>long-term</b> <b>rate</b> to increase. The best we could suggest was to raise the short-term interest rate as high as possible until it reaches 14. 1 % while keeping the <b>long-term</b> <b>rate</b> intact...|$|E

In particular, a decrease in the short-term rate leads to a decrease in the <b>long-term</b> <b>rate</b> that is smaller in magnitude than the increase in the <b>long-term</b> <b>rate</b> associated with an increase in the short-term rate of the same size. Up to the extent that monetary policy acts by affecting long-term rates through the term structure, its power is considerably reduced at low interest rates.
