There was never any mystery about what it was, what the Habbush letter was, what the Habbush mission entailed, in terms of the setup with the Iraq intelligence chief. I mean, exhaustive, hour after hour. And the way I do it as an investigative reporter, is you go back again and again and again." [...] And in the NPR interview, he claims that both Richer and Maguire had indicated a willingness to testify against the Administration about these allegations: [...] "both of them, frankly, are big believers in the truth process. And Ive talked to both of them about, Hey, youre never going to feel heat quite like this. And they said, both of them, Richer and Maguire, Im ready to go in front of Senate committees and House committees. Im ready to have my moment. They knew everything that was in the book.

5000|$|This was the {{official}} language of the 1st and 2nd IPC in 1998 and 2000 respectively.It separated {{the model of the}} planning problem in two major parts: (1) domain description and (2) the related problem description. Such a division of the model allows for an intuitive separation of those elements, which are (1) present in every specific problem of the problem-domain (these elements are contained in the domain-description), and those elements, which (2) determine the specific planning-problem (these elements are contained in the problem-description). Thus several problem-descriptions may be connected to the same domain-description (just like several instances may exist of a class in OOP (Object Oriented Programming) or in OWL (Ontology Web Language) for example). Thus a domain and a connecting problem description forms the PDDL-model of a planning-problem, and eventually this is the input of a planner (usually domain-independent AI planner) software, which aims to solve the given planning-problem via some appropriate planning algorithm. The output of the planner is not specified by PDDL, but it is usually a totally or partially ordered plan (a sequence of actions, some of which may be executed even in parallel sometimes). Now <b>lets</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> look at the contents of a PDDL1.2 domain and problem description in general...(1) The domain description consisted of a domain-name definition, definition of requirements (to declare those model-elements to the planner which the PDDL-model is actually using), definition of object-type hierarchy (just like a class-hierarchy in OOP), definition of constant objects (which are present in every problem in the domain), definition of predicates (templates for logical facts), and also the definition of possible actions (operator-schemas with parameters, which should be grounded/instantiated during execution). Actions had parameters (variables that may be instantiated with objects), preconditions and effects. The effects of actions could be also conditional (when-effects).(2) The problem description consisted of a problem-name definition, the definition of the related domain-name, the definition of all the possible objects (atoms in the logical universe), initial conditions (the initial state of the planning environment, a conjunction of true/false facts), and the definition of goal-states (a logical expression over facts that should be true/false in a goal-state of the planning environment). Thus eventually PDDL1.2 captured the [...] "physics" [...] of a deterministic single-agent discrete fully accessible planning environment.|$|E

Before we discuss security for SOA, <b>lets</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> {{step back and}} examine what SOA is. SOA is an architectural approach which involves applications being exposed as "services". Originally, services in SOA were associated {{with a stack of}} technologies which included SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI. This article addresses the defects of traditional enterprise application integration by combining service oriented-architecture and web service technology. Application integration is then simplified to development and integration of services to tackle connectivity of isomerous enterprise application integration, security, loose coupling between systems and process refactoring and optimization.

40|$|In {{this and}} the next lecture, {{we are going to}} {{consider}} approaches to clustering the vertices of a graph. I think that we understand reasonably well how to partition the vertices of a graph into two sets. However, in clustering, we want to divide the vertices of a graph into many sets. This problem is not nearly as well understood. There is quite a bit of disagreement over what one should be optimizing. Even once one has a measure of the quality of a clustering, it is usually computationally difficult to find a clustering that optimizes this measure. So, one typically uses a heuristic. The best heuristics typically combine two operations: a global optimization followed by local improvements. This lecture will probably just focus on the global optimizations, unless I have time time to implement some local improvement algorithms. Thealgorithms that workbestdependquiteabitontheareaofapplication. TheScientificComputing community has developed a number of algorithms for partitioning well-shaped meshes (Chaco, Metis and Scotch). Different, but related, algorithms have proved popular in Image Segmentation (Shi and Malik, Yu and Shi). A very different type of algorithm is popular with Phyisicists who now study social networks. We will see this type of algorithm next lecture. For now, let me recommend the survey of von Luxburg [Lux 07]. 19. 2 K-Means Before we get too into how one shouldcluster the vertices of a graph, <b>lets</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> moment to consider the seemingly easier problem of clustering vectors in IR d.

40|$|Many {{people do}} not realize the real danger from rootkit technology. One {{reason for this is}} {{probably}} that publicly available rootkits for Windows OS are relatively easy to detect by conventional methods (i. e. memory scanning based). However, we can imagine some techniques of rootkit implementation, which will be undetectable by these methods, even if the rootkit concept will be publicly available â€¦ In order to convince people that traditional rootkit detection is insufficient it would be desirable to have a working rootkit implementing such sophisticated technology. Besides it would be fun. Assumptions The rootkit, which we are going to discuss, should provide only two features: ï¿½ Process hiding ï¿½ Network Covert Channel Rootkit should be undetectable by memory scanning-based methods, with the assumption, that everybody knows the technique it exploits. In this way it should be similar to modern cryptographic algorithms, where the strength of the cipher is not based on the obscurity of the encrypting method but on the secret key. Rootkit should work on Windows 2000 and 2003 systems. Server systems are of the primary concern, since rootkit is not going to employ any mechanisms to survive system restart, because such actions cannot be made stealth enough (vide Forensic Analysis). Traditional process hiding techniques There are many techniques for hiding processes in the system. <b>Lets</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> brief look at them and discuss their weaknesses: ï¿½ DLL infection (file replacement) â€“ new DLL (NTDLL. DLL for e. g.) is provided with some functions patched (like ZwQuerySystemInformation). Easily detectable by file system integrity checkers (provided they are not using DLL, but direct int 2 eh calls) 1. ï¿½ API hooking â€“ almost the same as above, but no file replacement is needed. Infection is done by means of OpenProcess(), WriteProcessMemory(), etc â€¦ Example rootkit of this kind is HackerDefender [1]. There is similar problem here to the above, although the tool for checking integrity of process address space should be little more sophisticated [2]. There is also another method of disclosing all hidden process by this and above methods. Administrator can use a 1 It would be interested if someone will check such commercial products like Tripwire or Intact, if they are using NTDLL functions to read files or not...|$|E
