6000|$|She was powerfully {{moved as}} she went in to say good-by to him. He {{was sitting in a}} chair, but looked very pale and weak. She said: [...] "Mose, you're in luck; you've got a woman who'll do you good. She's loyal and she's strong, and there's nothing further for me to do--unless you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help</b> you. See here, why not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help</b> you get a start; what do you say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't understand. The {{only thing}} I {{see is that}} you're not logical. It's obvious now that you must, if possible, find the ore; and yet you object to <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>help.</b> If you give up the search and return to Toronto, {{it may be a}} very long time before you can make another trip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! God, give me this man's life! Give {{it to me}} {{to atone}} for the other I destroyed! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> but <b>help</b> him, and do with me as Thou wilt!' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Winston dryly, [...] "but one {{is apt to}} make an {{explanation}} too complete occasionally. Will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help</b> you down?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I knew we'd be friends," [...] {{cried the}} little one dancing about. [...] "And you'll <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go and <b>help</b> you buy your things, won't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The gambler {{waved his}} proffered arm aside. [...] "I'm {{not so bad}} as all that," [...] said he. [...] "I <b>let</b> <b>me</b> little Corporal <b>help</b> me--sometimes for love of it, not because I nade it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't go home, for if Aunty isn't {{there it}} will be very dismal.

6000|$|... "You are in trouble," [...] he said. [...] "Will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> try to <b>help</b> you?" [...] A sob shook her--the {{beginning}} of a new paroxysm. He waited patiently until it was over. Suddenly she got rather wildly and unsteadily to her feet.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I must go to-morrow. But I {{shall not}} <b>let</b> you <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to pack, so don't {{entertain}} any unreasonable projects, but lie still. Mr. Brand is coming, Nanny says.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know," [...] {{replied the}} girl sadly. [...] "That's {{all the more}} reason you should <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help</b> you. Pray don't refuse. It will--mean so much to me." ...|$|E

40|$|Consider {{my world}} please. I’ve {{been born in}} the last decade and {{everyone}} in our family has a mobile phone. We play games at home on the computer and I teach my parents how to use the Internet. Mum loves <b>me</b> <b>helping</b> and Dad and I have heaps of fun. My teacher Mrs Cool is great – she <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> <b>help</b> the other kids in our class and sometimes I get to do awesome things for school. …Having my own computer at school would be better”. The messages in this student’s observations are many and complex. While personal computers may be the case for some privileged school contexts and equipping all teachers is the trend for public education in Australia this investment may be too little too late. The business world is leading the technological change towards online mobile devices and young people themselves are demanding more personalised access. Reflecting their socio-cultural need to be connected, there are urgent messages for educators to face for motivation and learning outcomes commensurate with curriculum reforms. Computer laboratories are being challenged by the need to tool young people with handheld computers. This paper takes up some of these issues with reference to ongoing ARC funded research projects...|$|R
40|$|In this article, I will {{investigate}} {{the concept of}} ‘othering’ originally {{as part of a}} post-colonial theory. This concept is interested in many academic areas, including a literary study. In Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Go is about human clones raised for organs. The clones are excluded and discriminated to be ‘the other’ from the normal people. The manifestations of othering in Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Go can be presented in the forms of linguistic features, indoctrination, objectification, and assimilation. Although the othering phenomenon {{can be found in the}} reality, it can be appeared in literary texts as well. The findings show that the study of Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Go <b>helps</b> us to understand and aware of how the negative consequences of the othering process affect undesirable treatments in the society as a whole...|$|R

6000|$|The girl felt {{fear and}} love rush up desperately to {{overwhelm}} her. She choked them back, and said quite quietly: [...] "I will. I promise. Only <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help</b> nurse him!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{never can}} tell what Tom means,' said Mary, {{as she went}} up-stairs with Ethel. 'It was a very {{comfortable}} rest. I wish you had had the same, dear Ethel, you look so tired and worn out. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> stay and <b>help</b> you. It {{has been such a}} sad long day; and oh! how terrible this is!
