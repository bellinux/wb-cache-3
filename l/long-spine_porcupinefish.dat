5|$|The typical hunting {{strategy}} of the diamond stingray is to cruise just above the sea floor, landing atop any prey encountered. It then quickly levers its body up-and-down with its disc, producing negative pressure to extract the prey from its burrow. This ray has also been known to excavate large pits by undulating its disc and spitting jets of water, so as to uncover buried prey. Diamond stingrays are frequently trailed by smaller fishes, including Mexican hogfish (Bodianus diplotaenia), Galapagos porgies (Calamus taurinus), greybar grunts (Haemulon sexfasciatum), spinster wrasses (Halichoeres nichols), and <b>long-spine</b> <b>porcupinefish</b> (Diodon holocanthus), which {{take advantage of the}} invertebrates stirred up by the ray's activities. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium bullardi, A. dasi, A. rajivi, and A. soberoni, Anthocephalum currani, Parachristianella tiygonis, and Pseudochristianello elegantissima, the flukes Anaporrhutum euzeti and Probolitrema mexicana, and the monogenean Listrocephalos kearni.|$|E

50|$|The Black-blotched porcupinefish is a {{medium-sized}} fish which grows up to 65 cm, {{but the average}} size {{most likely to be}} observed is 45 cm.Its body is elongated with a spherical head with big round protruding eyes and a large mouth that is rarely closed. The pectoral fins are large, the pelvic fins are absent, the anal and dorsal fins are close to the caudal peduncle. The latter move simultaneously during swimming. All fins are a uniform tint of white or yellowish without any spotting.The skin is smooth and firm, the scales are modified into spines directed towards the back.The body coloration is light brown to sandy-yellowwith dark blotches circled with a white line and pale ventral surface. The only other fish with which it might be confused is the <b>long-spine</b> <b>porcupinefish,</b> (Diodon holocanthus) but it has much shorter spines and it lacks a dark streak running between the eyes.|$|E
