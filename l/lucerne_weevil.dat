Additionally, the interactive effects of multiple factors associated with climate change such as elevated temperature (eT) and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO 2) are untested. We investigated how eT and eCO 2 affected larval development of the <b>lucerne</b> <b>weevil</b> (Sitona discoideus) and colonisation by the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), on three cultivars of a common host plant, lucerne (Medicago sativa). Sitona discoideus larvae feed on root nodules housing N 2 -fixing rhizobial bacteria, allowing us to test the effects of eT and eCO 2 on three trophic levels. Moreover, we assessed the influence of these factors on plant growth. eT increased plant growth rate initially (6, 8 and 10 weeks after sowing), with cultivar ‘Sequel’ achieving the greatest height. Inoculation with aphids, however, reduced plant growth at week 14. eT severely reduced root nodulation by 43 %, whereas eCO 2 promoted nodulation by 56 %, but only at ambient temperatures. Weevil presence increased net root biomass and nodulation, by 31 and 45 %, respectively, showing an overcompensatory plant growth response. Effects of eT and eCO 2 on root nodulation were mirrored by weevil larval development; eT and eCO 2 reduced and increased larval development, respectively. Contrary to expectations, aphid colonisation was unaffected by eT or eCO 2, but there was a near-significant 10 % reduction in colonisation rates on plants with weevils present belowground. The contrasting effects of eT and eCO 2 on weevils potentially occurred through changes in root nodulation patterns...|$|E
