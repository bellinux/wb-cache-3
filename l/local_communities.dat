40|$|Detecting {{communities}} within networks is {{of great}} importance to understand the structure and organizations of real-world systems. To this end, {{one of the major}} challenges is to find the <b>local</b> <b>community</b> from a given node with limited knowledge of the global network. Most of the existing methods largely depend on the starting node and require predefined parameters to control the agglomeration procedure, which may cause disturbing inference to the results of <b>local</b> <b>community</b> detection. In this work, we propose a parameter-free <b>local</b> <b>community</b> detecting algorithm, which uses two self-adaptive phases in detecting the <b>local</b> <b>community,</b> thus comprehensively considering the external and internal link similarity of neighborhood nodes in each clustering iteration. Based on boundary nodes identification, our self-adaptive method can effectively control the scale and scope of the <b>local</b> <b>community.</b> Experimental results show that our algorithm is efficient and well-behaved in both computer-generated and real-world networks, greatly improving the performance of <b>local</b> <b>community</b> detection in terms of stability and accuracy...|$|R

After the first season, however, Sesame Street was so widely watched that it was difficult to make this distinction; ETS began to have problems finding subjects for their non-viewing groups, which weakened the experimental design. It solved this problem by selecting control-group households from areas that did not broadcast the show. Instead of using groups of viewers and non-viewers, later large-scale studies used statistical designs and methods for estimating cause-effect relationships.|$|E
