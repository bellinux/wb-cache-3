Although numerous pre-clinical data have been published, we address the subject of radiotherapy-stem cells interaction from the clinical efficacy and toxicity perspective.

It is particularly suggested in glioblastoma, where CSCs were showed to be housed in the subventricular zone (SVZ).

40|$|Activated B-Cell (ABC) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is a common, {{aggressive}} and poorly chemoresponsive subtype of DLBCL, characterized by constitutive canonical NF-κB signaling. Inhibition of NF-κB signaling leads to apoptosis of ABC-DLBCL cell lines, suggesting targeted disruption of this pathway may have therapeutic relevance. The selective IKK inhibitor, NEMO Binding Domain (NBD) peptide effectively blocks constitutive NF-κB activity and induces apoptosis in ABC-DLBCL cells in vitro. Here {{we used a}} comparative approach to determine the safety and efficacy of systemic NBD peptide to inhibit constitutive NF-κB signaling in privately owned dogs with spontaneous newly diagnosed or relapsed ABC-like DLBCL. Malignant lymph nodes biopsies were taken before and twenty-four hours after peptide administration to determine biological effects.

40|$|Paracetamol is used {{clinically}} for {{the treatment}} of pain and fever. Recent investigations in experimental animals confirmed paracetamol is able to induce potent hypothermia, which is self-reversible and does not lead to any <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>toxicities.</b> In this investigation, the authors sought to investigate the mechanism through which paracetamol induces hypothermia in experimental animals. The authors present strong scientific evidence, which demonstrate that the paracetamol-induced hypothermia is mediated through inhibition of the activity of the novel cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, COX- 3. Further investigations confirm that the paracetamol induced hypothermia is not dependent on interactions with the endocannabinoid or transient receptor potential vanillid- 1 (TRPV- 1). In addition, co-administration of paracetamol with a cannabinoid agonist resulted in synergistic hypothermia. These data provide a strong rationale for the use of paracetamol along with a cannabinoid agonist for the induction of therapeutic hypothermia in the clinic. Hypothermia is induced for therapeutic purposes in critically ill patients presenting to the clinic with stroke, cardiac arrest or neurotrauma. However, the current approaches used for the induction of therapeutic hypothermia are inefficient, slow and can only be performed in the hospital setting. Most of the neuronal damage takes place during the first hour following the development of critical illness. Having provided evidence on the mechanism of paracetamol-induced hypothermia and the fact that paracetamol and cannabinoid agonists induced synergistic hypothermia, we propose that combination therapy can be translated to the clinic for the induction of therapeutic hypothermia. The advantages that drug-induced therapeutic hypothermia offer over the currently used methods for the induction of therapeutic hypothermia include fact onset of hypothermia; within a few minutes as opposed to 30 - 60 minutes. This approach offers a cheap and readily available method for the induction of therapeutic hypothermia that has the potential of saving thousands of lives...|$|R

40|$|Remarkable {{progress}} has been made in the management of HIV/AIDS since the first cases of AIDS were reported in the US in 1981. By 1983 HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS and the first antiretroviral, AZT, was approved in 1987. Unfortunately it soon became apparent that AZT monotherapy resulted in incomplete viral suppression and the rapid emergence of antiretroviral drug mutations resulting in a time-limited clinical benefit of the drug. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which typically comprised of three drugs including a protease inhibitor or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, was introduced in 1996 together with HIV viral load quantitation for prognostication and routine monitoring of patients. These advances were followed by an almost immediate rapid decline in HIV related morbidity and death. However these early “HAART” regimens were also associated with very high pill burden and newly emerging drug toxicities such as lipoatrophy and metabolic syndrome which were initially poorly understood. Specific drug toxicities have now been well characterised and most of the first generation nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI) have been replaced by a second generation of drugs which are much better tolerated and have few short or <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>toxicities.</b> A number of these newer drugs have been co-formulated to reduce the pill burden and increase patient convenience. New generations of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI) and protease inhibitors and new classes of drugs such as integrase and entry inhibitors emerging over the last five years have provided effective and safe ART options for heavily treatment experienced patients [...] As a result it is expected in contemporary practice that most ART treatment naive and experienced patients will achieve a persistently undetectable plasma HIV viral load of < 40 copies/ml and improvement or maintenance of immune function.
