40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the process of}} <b>leaving</b> the parental <b>home</b> among young adults is studied. After a brief {{historical}} overview, three main reasons for <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> are distinguished, viz. <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> to complete an education, <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> to start living with a partner, and <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> to gain more autonomy and independence. Both the timing and {{the main reason for}} <b>leaving</b> the parental <b>home</b> is expected to depend on the resources of the young adults' parents. Four classes of parental resources are distinguished, viz. material and non-material resources that can be transferred to young adults, and material and non-material resources that cannot be transferred to young adults. It is hypothesized that high levels of transferable parental resources facilitate the process of <b>leaving</b> <b>home,</b> whereas high levels of non-transferable resources slow down this process. The hypotheses are tested using data from a survey among 583 young adults born in 1961 in the Netherlands. Discrete-time hazard models are used to test the effect of parental resources on the process of <b>leaving</b> <b>home.</b> Most hypotheses, though not all, are supported by the data. High levels of transferable parental resources speed up the process of <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> for educational and independence reasons, though not for reasons of starting a partner relationship. High levels of non-transferable parental resources slow down the process of <b>leaving</b> <b>home,</b> though only with regard to <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> in order to gain autonomy and independence...|$|R
40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{association}} between social norms and the timing of <b>leaving</b> <b>home.</b> Although largely overlooked by most recent studies on <b>leaving</b> <b>home,</b> life-course theory suggests that age norms and age grading infl uence life-course decisions in general and <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> in particular. We use Fishbein and Ajzen’s model of “reasoned behavior” to integrate this strand of research with the more individualistic view that dominates current thinking. Using data from a Dutch panel survey, we use a Cox regression model with a control for sample selection to estimate {{the association between}} perceived age norms and the timing of <b>leaving</b> <b>home.</b> We show that perceived opinions of parents {{are associated with the}} actual timing of <b>leaving</b> the parental <b>home</b> but that societal norms and friends’ norms concerning the timing of <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> are not. In addition, the timing of <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> is also associated with the perceived housing market situation. ...|$|R

We find that <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> does have a causal effect on poverty entry, particularly in Scandinavian countries; cross-national differences are partly, but not fully, explained by differences in destinations on <b>leaving</b> <b>home...</b>|$|R

Spanish {{transitions}} {{out of the}} parental home are characterized by older ages of leaving and a close association between <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> and partnership formation, compared to countries in northern Europe. Yet throughout Spain we find important regional variation in the intensity and timing of <b>leaving</b> <b>home.</b> This paper provides {{new insights into the}} causes of this regional diversity, focusing on both economic and cultural dimensions. The analyses are based on multilevel models that control for individual and provincial characteristics. Economic factors play a vital role at the individual level, yet are less important at the provincial level.

40|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} poverty in Europe is the close connection between young people’s living arrangement and economic disadvantage. <b>Leaving</b> <b>home</b> is generally associated with {{a higher degree of}} poverty and compared to other events, such as experiencing unemployment and having children, it {{is by far the most}} important driver behind youth poverty. There is however huge variations across countries. It is natural to assume that young people would delay <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> if they consider this to jeopardise their level of wellbeing (i. e. entering poverty). However, assessing the causality issue between <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> and poverty is difficult. In this paper we implement a statistical approach to analyse the causal effect of <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> on entering poverty. We use data from the European Community Household Panel and propensity score estimation techniques, and find that the event of <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> does have a particularly strong effect in entering poverty in Scandinavian countries, but rather weak effect among Mediterranean countries...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} limited {{research}} regarding how minority culture youth experience <b>leaving</b> <b>home.</b> Eight African American individuals who had “launched” from their families-of-origin were interviewed.

According to the findings in this study, <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> for young African Americans is a culturally distinct experience which aligns more closely with traditional patterns of <b>leaving</b> <b>home.</b> Although the emerging adulthood era functions as {{a context in which}} the participants exist, the young African American participants in this study identified delayed launching as a “failure. ...|$|R
40|$|Background : There is {{a strong}} {{variation}} in young adults' leaving-home behavior throughout Europe. Earlier {{research has indicated that}} individual and parental education are crucial determinants of <b>leaving</b> <b>home.</b> It is, however, unclear how country contexts shape the association between young adults' education as well as parental education and <b>leaving</b> the parental <b>home.</b> Objective : The current study examines country differences in the effect of young adults' education and parental education on <b>leaving</b> the parental <b>home</b> for the first time across 17 European countries. Methods : We use data from the Harmonized Histories Program for 85, 243 young adults (aged 16 - 35 years) in 17 European countries. We estimate discrete-time competing-risks event history models of <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> to live without a partner versus with a partner. Results : Our results underscore the importance of the country context in shaping young adults' <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> and how it is affected by educational attainment, enrollment, and parental education. For example, the positive educational gradient in <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> to live without a partner was found to be stronger in most of the Western European countries (except Austria) and less strong in Sweden and Norway and in most of the Eastern European countries (except the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland). Contribution : This study complements and updates our understanding of <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> in Europe by focusing on the relation between young adults' education and parental education and <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> across Western and Eastern European countries...|$|R
