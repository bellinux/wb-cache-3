40|$|Method For this study, {{a series}} of adult human formalin-embalmed cadavers was used. The study was {{performed}} in the dissection room of the Anatomy Department at the Medical School of the University of Athens (Athens, Greece). All cadavers were donators {{and did not have}} any pathology in the thoracic wall. Each cadaver was placed in the prone position, and specific thoracic levels were identified by palpation of the scapula and the intercostals spaces. In embalmed cadavers the production of gas in tissues generates variable artifacts that limit ultrasound examination. For this reason, an anesthesiologist with clinical experience in ultrasound-guided techniques assessed the ability to obtain an acceptable sonographic image of the posterior area of the trunk between the level of the fifth and seventh thoracic (Th) vertebrae. A portable ultrasound machine (MicroMaxx, SonoSite Inc., Bothel, WA, USA; L 38 e 10 - 5 MHz broadband linear array) was used to identify specific anatomic structures (spinous and transverse process, ribs, external intercostal muscle and pleura) in each cadaver In case the imaging quality of the examined tissues was poor at an extended area of the trunk of a cadaver, then that particular cadaver was excluded from the study. Cadavers with artifacts limited to a small number of intercostal spaces were enrolled, excluding the particular unacceptable spaces. For all enrolled cadavers, randomization by coin toss determined the side of the body on which all intercostal injections were performed with the first technique, denoted as the transverse technique; at the opposite side all the injections were made with the second technique, denoted as the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>technique.</b> The level of the examined intercostal spaces was from Th 5 to Th 7. On each side, when the Th 5 and Th 7 spaces were acceptable, they were both used for the same technique. In all other cases, a single injection was made to the intercostal space that presented the best sonographic image among Th 5, Th 6, and Th 7 spaces of the same side and using the selected technique for that particular side. For the transverse technique, the probe was placed transversely near the midline, and the spinous process, the lamina and the transverse process were recognized with their typical acoustic shadow. The probe was then moved laterally and slightly obliquely, heading slightly caudal and following the course of the rib. More laterally, the rib was visualized at a small depth from the skin surface. As the probe slid caudally, the rib disappeared and the pleura was depicted at a deeper level as a hyperechoic structure. The aim was to obtain a sonographic view exactly below the inferior margin of the rib, a region adjacent to the intercostal groove. At this site, the lateral part of the pleura appears parallel to the skin surface while the medial part curves into the mediastinum. An 18 -gauge Tuohy needle (EpiLong I, Pajunk, Germany) was inserted using the in-plane approach. [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: There are {{currently}} no available prostheses {{that can be}} used for extremely small femurs or tibias of adult patients in countries where allograft is unavailable. Case report: We report the case of a 17 -year-old girl requiring special limb salvage technique for distal femur reconstruction following resection of malignant tumor. This technique was needed because of a very narrow canal of the tibia. We split bilateral tibial cortices longitudinally with osteotomies to enlarge tibial canal enough to insert conventional endoprosthesis. After insertion of the implant, split tibia reduced with titanium cables and bands, and the split clefts were filled with cancellous bone. Fifteen months after the operation, proper fixation was achieved with bony fusion of bilateral split clefts and ambulation without assistance was achieved. Discussion: Any proper surgical procedure for our patient were reported previously. We developed a conventional non-expandable endoprosthesis for distal femur replacement using the double <b>longitudinal</b> split <b>technique</b> as a solution to this difficult problem. Conclusion: Our <b>longitudinal</b> split <b>technique</b> should be applicable to adult patients with skeletal immaturity requiring resection of juxta-articular malignant tumors and in other situations complicated by the presence of a narrow canal...|$|R
40|$|Complementary and {{alternative}} medicine is increasingly popular in Australia and particularly among women. While existing research provides {{some understanding of}} women 2 ̆ 7 s engagement with complementary {{and alternative}} medicine and biomedicine, there has been comparatively little examination of the day-to-day character of their experiences. In this study, we utilise solicited diaries with women aged 60 - 65 years drawn from the 1946 - 1951 cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health to capture the temporal dimension of their therapeutic engagement.

40|$|Streptococcus pyogenes causes an {{estimated}} 616 million pharyngitis cases {{per year and}} a variety of invasive diseases such as necrotising fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome. The human nasopharynx is the major reservoir for all S. pyogenes infection, including severe invasive disease. A combination of biophotonic imaging (BPI) and direct nasal sampling techniques were used to longitudinally measure the in vivo carriage of S. pyogenes, looking at the effects of virulence factor expression on carriage and transmission and to enable vaccine evaluation. Direct nasal sampling demonstrated that the two component regulatory system, CovR/S, is required for infection and transmission from the nasopharynx. The fitness cost conferred by covR/S mutation in the nasopharynx may explain why S. pyogenes with altered covR/S have not become prevalent in community infections despite conferring a selective advantage in invasive infection. Bioluminescent S. pyogenes strains expressing the luxABCDE operon demonstrated a growth deficit independent of the target site for integration in vitro that manifested as a fitness cost during infection in vivo. Notwithstanding this, bioluminescence expression permitted longitudinal quantitation of S. pyogenes within the nasopharynx using BPI. Intramuscular vaccination with heat killed streptococci or the streptococcal chemokine protease SpyCEP conferred protection against pharyngeal infection in this model. These <b>longitudinal</b> <b>techniques</b> allow for S. pyogenes to be tracked in the nasopharynx non-invasively, and allow for new insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.

This cross sectional study is of 4419 male postmen and 787 male postal officers and postal assistants, of whom 3753 and 709 respectively were employed for the whole year of the study from 1 April 1982 to 31 March 1983. A stratification technique {{was used to assess}} the influence of duration of service on sickness absence within certain age ranges. Differences in the proportion of men taking more than a stated number of spells or days, in groups of short and long service, are tested statistically using Chi square tests with a continuity correction. Statistically significant reductions, with increasing duration of service, are found for self certificated spells and days in all postmen and for certificated spells but not days in younger postmen. Older postal officers and postal assistants have a statistically significant reduction in self certificated spells. Young postal officers and postal assistants show no significant change in spells and days of sickness absence with duration of service. It is concluded that the excess severity of sickness absence in younger postmen is due to self certificated absence rather than certificated absence. The difference in severity of sickness absence in various diagnostic groups with increasing duration of service is discussed.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a chronic}} disease with an inflammatory and neurodegenerative pathology. Axonal loss and neurodegeneration occurs {{early in the}} disease course and may lead to irreversible neurological impairment. Changes in brain volume, observed from the earliest stage of MS and proceeding throughout the disease course, may be an accurate measure of neurodegeneration and tissue damage. There {{are a number of}} magnetic resonance imaging-based methods for determining global or regional brain volume, including cross-sectional (e. g. brain parenchymal fraction) and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>techniques</b> (e. g. SIENA [Structural Image Evaluation using Normalization of Atrophy]). Although these methods are sensitive and reproducible, caution must be exercised when interpreting brain volume data, as numerous factors (e. g. pseudoatrophy) may have a confounding effect on measurements, especially in a disease with complex pathological substrates such as MS. Brain volume loss has been correlated with disability progression and cognitive impairment in MS, with the loss of grey matter volume more closely correlated with clinical measures than loss of white matter volume. Preventing brain volume loss may therefore have important clinical implications affecting treatment decisions, with several clinical trials now demonstrating an effect of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) on reducing brain volume loss. In clinical practice, it may therefore be important to consider the potential impact of a therapy on reducing the rate of brain volume loss. This article reviews the measurement of brain volume in clinical trials and practice, the effect of DMTs on brain volume change across trials and the clinical relevance of brain volume loss in MS...|$|R

A magnetic multilayer system in the structure of CoO(30 Å) /Cu(tCu,) / NiFe(30 Å) (tCu = 0, 3, 6,..., 21 Å) has been systematically studied by Polar and <b>Longitudinal</b> MOKE <b>techniques.</b> In Polar Configuration, we have observed the hysteresis loops with large peak-to-peak amplitude. The exchange field HE and the coercivity HC were observed to be zero in this configuration. The polar Kerr rotation is determined and showed to be proportional to the magnetic field applied. In Longitudinal Configuration, we have determined the hysteresis loops that the exchange field and coercivity were non-zero. Also the exchange field and coercivity found in CoO/NiFe bilayer were larger than that have been observed. The Kerr intensities in Longitudinal Configuration are about 10 times smaller than that in Polar Configuration. As the thicknesses of CoO layer in our samples are 30 Å, the Neel temperature TN of CoO is much lower than that of bulk CoO. Due to the limitation of our sample cooling system, the finite size effect resulted {{in the fact that the}} hysteresis loops were only measured above the Neel temperature.

Assays included an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to schizont antigens; an indirect immunofluorescence assay for total antiblood-stage antibodies; an immunofluorescence assay on glutaraldehyde-fixed parasites to detect antibodies to antigen Pf 155; an assay for serum inhibition of red blood cell invasion; a micro-agglutination assay to detect antibodies to neo-antigens on the surface of infected red blood cells; and an assay using polymorphonuclear leucocytes to detect antibodies capable of opsonizing schizont infected red blood cells. There were marked differences in the age-related pattern of response for different assays performed on sera obtained at a cross-sectional survey of 280 individuals. Examination of the correlation between the various immune responses and malariometric indices at the population level and at the individual level provided no evidence that any of the in vitro assays were related to protective immunity.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{education}} system so that students are not only reaching the minimum standards of literacy and numeracy but are also {{given the opportunity to}} excel, accurate measures of school performance are vital. These measures need to focus on student progress so that schools and teachers can focus on improving all students - particularly those most in need. A current trend in primary and secondary education in Australia is national testing, with the introduction of the National Assessment Program - Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN). This, along with similar tests like the Basic Skills Tests, measures student performance and progress over sequential years. The issue now is how to interpret these results for individuals, schools and educational authorities. The education system can be modelled with a hierarchical model due to the nesting of variables at the education system, school, classroom and student levels. Intertwined with the hierarchical nature of the model is also the longitudinal aspect of the data as students sit biennial NAPLAN assessments. We mainly investigate hierarchical modelling techniques, such as linear multilevel mixed effects and a Bayesian approach, to fit a statistical model which incorporates student and school predictor variables. In addition to hierarchical modelling methods, we also consider <b>longitudinal</b> <b>techniques.</b> The objective of this thesis is to investigate and determine what conclusions about student progress and school performance can be reliably drawn from regular standardised system-wide assessment, such as NAPLAN.

40|$|This inter-disciplinary project {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between family structure and early child health. The two main aims are: (1) to determine whether family structure and changes in family structure are associated with children's physical health in the Millennium Cohort Study; (2) to explore potential pathways through which these associations operate. In spite of much public debate around families, marriage, and child outcomes, UK literature on this topic remains incomplete. This thesis aims to fill two gaps: first, testing {{whether there is a}} link with children's physical health, rather than more commonly reported outcomes such as cognitive function or education achievements. Physical health outcomes included are respiratory health, childhood growth, and unintentional injuries. Second, few studies use prospective, longitudinal data and methods. Cross sectional studies cannot examine the direction of the relationship, nor capture the dynamics of changes in family structure. Here, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>techniques</b> test a complex model made up of variables ordered a priori. In unadjusted analyses, family structure presented a consistent gradient in child health: cross-sectionally, children living with married parents had better health than those living with cohabiting parents, while those living with lone parents had the worst health. Longitudinally, those who experienced changes in family structure fared worse than those living with continuously married parents, with some important exceptions, such as those living with cohabiting parents who subsequently married. Socio-economic factors were important predictors of family structure and child health. Proximal pathways through which socio-economic characteristics and family structure affected child health varied according to health outcome. Maternal mental health appeared to be important across outcomes. Concluding, this work shows the importance of using nuanced definitions of family, {{particularly when it comes to}} capturing its fluidity over time. Children who experienced changes in family structure were a heterogeneous group with diverse backgrounds and outcomes. Socio-economic factors emerged as important antecedents to both family structure and child health...|$|R
