Miranda finds the fourth note in Richard's shoe and learns that the <b>laughing</b> man came from the future to save Sal's life. The note asks Miranda to prepare a chronicle of recent events and deliver it by hand, {{but she does not}} know who to give it to.|$|E

40|$|In dialogue, {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} for people to <b>laugh</b> together. This joint laughter often results in overlapping laughter, consisting of an initiating <b>laugh</b> (the first one), and a responding <b>laugh</b> (the second one). In previous studies, we found that overlapping <b>laughs</b> are acoustically different from non-overlapping ones. So far, we have considered overlapping <b>laughs</b> as one category. Consequently, it is unknown whether there are also acoustic differences between initiating <b>laughs</b> and responding <b>laughs.</b> In this paper, we make a distinction between initiating, responding, and non-overlapping <b>laughs</b> and compare their acoustic characteristics. In particular, we will investigate the prosodic relations between initiating and responding <b>laughs.</b> Do these relations point to a form of accommodation and mimicry? To what extent are initiating and responding <b>laughs</b> paired to each other? The analyses were performed on two speech corpora containing spontaneous conversations between two speakers. Results show indications that initiating and responding <b>laughs</b> share several similar acoustic features that point towards accommodation and mimicry mechanisms...|$|R
5|$|McEwan's is {{well known}} for its {{cavalier}} mascot, broadly based on the Frans Hals painting, the <b>Laughing</b> Cavalier portrait, which has been used since the 1930s.

5|$|Miranda's mom {{is invited}} {{to appear on the}} $20,000 Pyramid. In hopes of winning the money and having a better life, Miranda and her mom's boyfriend Richard prep her for the show. Miranda and Sal are friends again. While her mother is on-stage, Miranda reminisces about a {{conversation}} with Marcus about how no one would recognize a time-traveler from a different age. She suddenly realizes that the <b>laughing</b> man is an older incarnation of Marcus, who has come from the future to save Sal's life. He needed to deliver the notes to the young Marcus through Miranda. Later on Miranda goes to the mailbox the <b>laughing</b> man (Marcus) slept under, where she finds a picture of an older version of Julia smiling happily. The novel ends as Miranda reflects on the events in an epilogue.|$|E
5|$|Most {{shooting}} {{was done at}} the Arthur Ranch in the San Francisco Valley, which was used as Aunt Elizabeth's estate for interior and exterior scenes. Beginning at the Arthur Ranch shoot, Grant and Hepburn often ad-libbed their dialogue and frequently delayed production by making each other laugh. The scene where Grant frantically asks Hepburn where his bone is was shot from 10 am until well after 4 pm because of the stars' <b>laughing</b> fits. After one month of shooting Hawks was seven days behind schedule. During the filming, Hawks would refer to four {{different versions of the}} film's script and make frequent changes to scenes and dialogue. His leisurely attitude on set and shutting down production to see a horse race contributed to the time it took to film, and he took twelve days to shoot the Westlake jail scene instead of the scheduled five. Hawks later facetiously blamed the setbacks on his two stars' <b>laughing</b> fits and having to work with two animal actors.|$|E

5|$|The aim of some later novels {{has been}} to {{concentrate}} as much on local colour as on the story. This was true of William Percival Crozier's historical romance The Fates Are <b>Laughing</b> (1945), set during the fall of Sejanus and the reign of Caligula, written by a classicist with an eye for detail.|$|E

Although Markley possessed the least musical talent, his expertise in law enabled him to assume control of the group's name and publishing, which generated a divide in the WCPAEB's creative mindset.|$|E
