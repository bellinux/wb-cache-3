40|$|A {{performance}} analysis {{has been made}} to determine whether boundary-layer control by suction might reduce the minimum take-off and landing distances of a four-place or five-place airplane or a liaison type of airplane below those obtainable with conventional high-lift devices. The airplane was assumed to have a cruise duration of 5 hours at 60 -percent power and to be operating from airstrips having a ground friction coefficient of 0. 2 or a combined ground and braking coefficient of 0. 4. The payload was fixed at 1500 pounds, the wing span was varied from 25 to 100 feet, the aspect ratio was varied from 5 to 15, and the power was varied from 300 to 1300 horsepower. Maximum lift coefficients of 5. 0 and 2. 8 were assumed for the airplanes with and without boundary-layer-control [...] equipment weight was included. The effects of the boundary-layer control on total take-off distance, total power-off landing distance, <b>landing</b> and take-off <b>ground</b> <b>run,</b> stalling speed, sinking speed, and gliding speed were determined...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{take-off}} {{and landing}} segments {{of an airplane}} trajectory are studied. The equations of motion for the <b>ground</b> <b>run</b> are derived and solved for distance. Then, specific formulas are obtained for the take-off ground distance and time and the <b>landing</b> <b>ground</b> distance and time. Transitions from take-off to climb and descent to landing are investigated so that take-off distance and landing distance and time can be estimated. The run distances and the run times for take-of and landing dependent of altitude, speed wing, temperature, the coefficient of rolling friction. In conformity with mathematical model, programs of calculation were elaborated. Also interfaces of calculations were elaborated for programs of calculation...|$|R
