Two different data schemes: non-return-to-zero (NRZ) and return-to-zero (RZ) are multiplexed {{in the electronic}} domain to generate a three-level coding sequence, on condition that in NRZ signal, the <b>logic</b> <b>state</b> 1 is represented by a high level (+E volts) and the <b>logic</b> <b>state</b> 0 by a zero level; while in RZ signal, the <b>logic</b> <b>state</b> 1 is represented by a low voltage (-E volts) and the <b>logic</b> <b>state</b> 0 by a zero level. Preliminary laboratory experiments show error-free transmission with a 195 Mbps, 215 - 1 pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS). The encrypted optical sequence, generated from two input signals, is conveniently produced by a standard Mach-Zehnder modulator and 1552. 52 nm wavelength DFB laser diode.

To model hidden trends and predict deterioration failure utilizing volatile <b>state</b> <b>indicators,</b> an adaptive support vector regression (ASVR) machine is proposed. In ASVR, {{the width of}} an error-insensitive tube, which is a constant in the traditional support vector regression, is set as a variable determined by the transient distribution boundary of local regions in the training time series. Thus, the localized regions are obtained using a sliding time window, and their boundaries are defined by a robust measure known as the truncated range. Utilizing an adaptive error-insensitive tube, a stabilized tolerance level for noise is achieved, whether the time series occurs in low-volatility regions or in high-volatility regions.
