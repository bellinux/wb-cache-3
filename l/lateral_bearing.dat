50|$|Confusingly, one of {{the first}} railway {{companies}} to use his axle-box design widely was the London and South Western Railway where the Locomotive Superintendent, the creator of the Adams Bogie, was also named William Adams. By further coincidence he too had formerly operated a locomotive works in Bow, but this was not a private concern but the depot of the North London Railway. In 1865 the Society of Engineers, London, made direct comparison between the bogie with the india-rubber <b>lateral</b> <b>bearing</b> of William Adams and the radial axle box of William Bridges Adams: during trials on the North London Railway the laterally sprung bogie was thought superior to the radial axle, but when William Adams moved to the LSWR he adopted the axle box designed by his rival Bridges Adams. The locomotives now known as Adams Radials are named after the Locomotive Superintendent, but they are famous for the axle invented by William Bridges Adams.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flowers of}} some species are borne in {{terminal}} spikes, whereas other species bear {{them in a}} four-flowered head. Bracts, usually broader than leaves and larger than the flowers, subtend each flower. This is one helpful distinction between specimens of Passerina and plants in the genus Struthiola. The calyx has four sepals, forming a flask-shaped or subcylindrical tube. At the mouth the sepals spread into lobes that are shorter than the tube. There are no petals, but the lobes of the sepals are quite colourfully petal-like in many species. The ovary is ovoid with a single loculus containing a solitary ovule. The style is <b>lateral,</b> <b>bearing</b> a mop-like stigma that fills {{the mouth of the}} calyx-tube. [...] The calyx is persistent and encloses the fruit except in species such as Passerina ericoides, in which the fruit is berry-like and expands until it protrudes out of the tube. A flower bears eight stamens of unequal length, the longest being the length of the calyx-lobes, but all protrude out of the calyx. The flowers lack of any noticeable scent, their protruding stamens, and their mop-like stigmata suggest their adaptation to wind pollination, in contrast to the petals and night scent of Struthiola.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} steel pipe sheet pile (SPSP) {{reinforcement}} method for existing caisson foundations in water. The technique involves driving SPSPs around the caisson foundation and connecting them {{to it with}} reinforcing footing. To support the rational design of reinforcements using this method, the following factors influencing the technique׳s effectiveness and related mechanical behavior should be considered: (1) {{the conditions of the}} caisson/SPSP reinforcement footing connection; (2) the caisson/SPSP flexural rigidity ratio; (3) the distance between the caisson and the SPSP wall; and (4) the pile length. However, as the influence of these factors on the reinforcement effect and mechanical behavior has not yet been clarified, the current method has no standardization for the concept of the load transfer mechanism in reinforced foundation systems, and the ultimate <b>lateral</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of existing caissons has been largely ignored in previous construction. This paper describes centrifuge model tests and three-dimensional elasto-plastic finite element total stress analysis conducted in relation to real cases in order to identify a more effective and rational reinforcement structure. The static <b>lateral</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity and seismic performance of reinforced foundations were investigated, and the following factors were considered: (1) the conditions of the caisson/SPSP reinforcement footing connection; (2) the caisson/SPSP flexural rigidity ratio; and (3) the pile length.

Piles in level ground and piles {{placed at a distance}} from the crest of a slope were examined, taking account of the effect of the adhesion at the pile–soil interface. The derived analytical solutions were used to develop charts relating the lateral pile capacity to the pile length/diameter ratio, the pile–soil adhesion, the distance of the point of load application from the ground to the pile diameter ratio, the inclination of the slope and the distance of the pile from the crest of the slope to the pile diameter ratio. They were also used to derive a reduction factor which, when multiplied by the <b>lateral</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity for level ground, gives the bearing capacity of the same pile near a slope. In addition, a critical non-dimensional distance between the pile and the crest of the slope, at which the bearing capacity approaches that for a level ground, was determined. The bearing capacity charts obtained for level ground were compared to the classic Broms' charts and to others derived using several different lateral earth pressure distributions along the pile. Comparisons were also made between the results of the proposed method for piles near slopes and those obtained from charts based on upper bound calculations. Finally, the proposed new method was validated through a comparison with the results {{of a large number of}} pile load tests, in which a remarkable agreement was observed between the analytical results and the measurements...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the torsional-lateral {{interactions}} seen in gear coupled rotors. Of particular interest are cases where the torsional stiffness parameters affect the lateral critical speeds and where lateral stiffness and damping parameters affect torsional critical speeds and amplitudes. A common procedure for critical speed calculations has been to solve lateral and torsional systems separately. This procedure is tested through an eigenvalue analysis. It is shown in this thesis, however, that torsional-lateral interactions play major roles in each other's critical speeds. Some research has seemingly uncoupled two lateral degrees of freedom from the gear system by choosing bearing forces and a coordinate system pointing {{along the line of}} action and normal to the line of action. This simplification method has been tested for cases when the <b>lateral</b> <b>bearing</b> stiffness becomes asymmetric.

An estimated equation for the <b>lateral</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity which considered the effect of edge stiffener was proposed.

The wall-frame analysis model was established, and the geometric parameters were defined. Pushover analysis of two specimens was carried out, and the analysis was validated by comparing the results from the experiment, the shell element model, and a simplified model. The simplified model provided a good prediction of the lateral stiffness and the strength of the steel slit wall, with less than 10 % error compared with the experimental results. The mutual effects of the bearing wall and the frame were also predicted correctly. In the end, the seismic performance evaluation of a steel slit wall-frame structure was presented.

40|$|The {{last years}} several {{offshore}} wind farms have been completed. Such farms typically {{consist of a}} few dozen wind turbines. The majority of these wind turbines is founded on mono-piles with a diameter of 4 – 5 m and is designed according to standards that use the p-y method for lateral loading conditions. However, this p-y method is not validated for such diameter piles. Full-scale field tests and model pile tests with properly scaled stress conditions subjected to lateral loads are scarce. This Thesis investigates {{the effect of a}} diameter increase on the <b>lateral</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of 2. 2 m and 4. 4 m diameter mono-piles in dry sand. Static displacement controlled and one-way cyclic force controlled model pile load tests were performed using the Delft University of Technology geotechnical centrifuge. Results show that the smaller 2. 2 m diameter pile has a lower secant and tangent soil- pile stiffness when compared to the 4. 4 m diameter pile. In all cases the tangent stiffness is about 50 % higher than the secant stiffness. Also, a force acting higher above soil surface yields a lower initial system stiffness. Results furthermore show that an increase in pile diameter with a constant slenderness or L/D-ratio, relative density Id and load excentricity e, leads to a significant increase in static lateral capacity. The secant and tangent stiffness also significantly increase with increasing diameter. The accumulation of lateral pile displacements as function of the number of applied one-way cyclic lateral loads has been investigated using 500 force controlled cycles. For an increasing number of load cycles the pile head displacements increase whilst the rate of accumulation decreases. However, additional loading cycles, up to e. g. 100000, are recommended. For static loading conditions experimental results have been compared to the default API formulation for laterally loaded piles. This default formulation shows a significant overestimation of the initial stiffness. However, after incorporating a stress dependent secant stiffness E 50, which has been derived from triaxial compression tests on model sand, good agreement is found between the experimental results and the modified API formulation for pile displacements < 0. 1 D. For displacements of about 0. 05 D the modified p-y method underestimates the <b>lateral</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of the 4. 4 m diameter pile by up to 25. Further research with loading conditions that mimic field loading conditions and a sample with a higher initial density are recommended.

40|$|Lattice-shaped {{diaphragm}} wall (hereafter referring to LSDW) {{is a new}} type of bridge foundation, and the relevant investigation on its horizontal behaviors is scant. This paper is devoted to the numerical study of the comparison on the static and seismic responses of LSDW and pile group under similar material quantity in soft soil. It can be found that the horizontal bearing capacity of LSDW is considerably larger than that of pile group, and the deformation pattern of LSDW basically appears to be an overall toppling while pile group clearly shows a local bending deformation pattern during the static loading process. The acceleration response and the acceleration amplification effects of LSDW are slightly greater than that of pile group due to the existing of soil core and the difference on the ability of energy dissipation. The horizontal displacement response of pile group is close to that of LSDW at first and becomes stronger than that of LSDW due to the generation of plastic soil deformation near the pile-soil interface at last. The pile body may be broken in larger potential than LSDW especially when its horizontal displacement is notable.

40|$|Double rows of {{stabilizing}} piles can {{be applied}} to large-scale landslide control; however, the geometry of the layout can substantially affect the <b>lateral</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of the structure. Based on slope slippage and deformation mechanisms, this paper proposes a specific pile layout configuration¿an embedded rear-row pile (with the top of the pile embedded to a certain depth in the slope), and a full-length fore-row pile (with the top of the pile {{on the surface of the}} slope). This layout appears to be a rational arrangement for resisting a landslide with a polyline slip surface using double-row piles. As for landslides with a linear slip surface, a full-length pile layout of fore- and rear-row piles can be adopted. However, the area of sliding mass directly supported by the rear (upslope) and fore piles should be approximately equal (in plane) to ensure that the thrust force on the piles above the slip surface is close to the optimum condition. Based on a numerical simulation, this paper also discusses a method for determining a rational embedded depth for the top of the rear-row piles for landslides with polyline slip surfaces, as well as a more rational pile structural form in the case of relatively short distances between the two rows of piles. The results obtained in this paper provide theoretical support for a rational layout of double-row piles for large-scale landslide controls, and provide assistance for practical reinforced slope projects...|$|E

40|$|As todays monopiles are {{regarded}} to have large diameters and considerably small embedding length to diameter ratios, current design methods {{are not entirely}} compatible with the engineering problem and may lead to conservative design. Additionally, vibro-driven monopiles can be a cost-effective and noise reducing alternative to standard impact driven ones. However up to now the influence of this technique {{with respect to the}} <b>lateral</b> load <b>bearing</b> behavior is not fully explored. To gain knowledge on pile-soil interaction for large diameter monopiles and to investigate differences due to the installation process, an extensive test campaign is carried out at the Test Center for Support Structures in Hannover. This contribution presents the design process and preliminary results of t he first phase Analysis of diameter-effects of the test campaign...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDynamic glycopolymers {{have been}} {{generated}} by polycondensation through acylhydrazone formation between components <b>bearing</b> <b>lateral</b> bioactive oligosaccharide chains. They have been characterized as bottlebrush type by cryo-TEM and SANS studies. They present remarkable fluorescence properties whose emission wavelengths {{depend on the}} constitution of the polymer and are tunable by constitutional modification through exchange/incorporation of components, thus also demonstrating their dynamic character. Constitution-dependent binding of these glycodynamers to a lectin, peanut agglutinin, has been demonstrated...|$|R
