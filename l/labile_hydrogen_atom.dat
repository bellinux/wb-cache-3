40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of electron capture and electron transfer dissociation (ECD and ETD) are investigated by covalently attaching a free-radical hydrogen atom scavenger to a peptide. The 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidin-l-oxyl (TEMPO) radical {{was chosen as}} the scavenger due to its high hydrogen atom affinity (ca. 280 kJ/mol) and low electron affinity (ca. 0. 45 eV), and was derivatized to the model peptide, FQX^(TEMPO) EEQQQTEDELQDK. The X^(TEMPO) residue represents a cysteinyl residue derivatized with an acetamido-TEMPO group. The acetamide group without TEMPO was also examined as a control. The gas phase proton affinity (882 kJ/mol) of TEMPO is similar to backbone amide carbonyls (889 kJ/mol), minimizing perturbation to internal solvation and sites of protonation of the derivatized peptides. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the TEMPO-tagged peptide dication generated stable odd-electron b and y type ions without indication of any TEMPO radical induced fragmentation initiated by hydrogen abstraction. The type and abundance of fragment ions observed in the CID spectra of the TEMPO and acetamide tagged peptides are very similar. However, ECD of the TEMPO-labeled peptide dication yielded no backbone cleavage. We propose that a <b>labile</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom</b> in the charge reduced radical ions is scavenged by the TEMPO radical moiety, resulting in inhibition of N-Cα backbone cleavage processes. Supplemental activation after electron attachment (ETcaD) and CID of the charge-reduced precursor ion generated by electron transfer of the TEMPO-tagged peptide dication produced a series of b + H (b^H) and y + H (y^H) ions along with some c ions having suppressed intensities, consistent with stable O-H bond formation at the TEMPO group. In summary, the results indicate that ECD and ETD backbone cleavage processes are inhibited by scavenging of a <b>labile</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom</b> by the localized TEMPO radical moiety. This observation supports the conjecture that ECD and ETD processes involve long-lived intermediates formed by electron capture/transfer in which a <b>labile</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom</b> is present and plays a key role with low energy processes leading to c and z ion formation. Ab initio and density functional calculations are performed to support our conclusion, which depends most importantly on the proton affinity, electron affinity and hydrogen atom affinity of the TEMPO moiety...|$|E

The {{formation of}} SiC 5 H 16 NO+ involves dissociation of a SiO bond and {{formation of an}} OH bond through rearrangement. The fragmentation mechanism was investigated utilizing ab initio calculations and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry in combination with hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange reactions. Sustained off-resonance irradiation collision-induced dissociation (SORI-CID) studies of the fully deuterated ion D 2 N(CH 2) 3 SiOSi(CH 2) 3 ND 3 + provided convincing evidence for a backbiting mechanism which involves hydrogen transfer from the terminal amine group to the oxygen to form a silanol-containing species. Theoretical calculations indicated decomposition of H 2 N(CH 2) 3 SiOSi(CH 2) 3 NH 3 + through a backbiting mechanism is the lowest energy decomposition channel, compared with other alternative routes. Two mechanisms were proposed for the fragmentation process {{which leads to the}} siloxane bond cleavage and the SORI-CID results of partially deuterated precursor ions suggest both mechanisms should be operative.

2500|$|Today, {{hydrogen}} peroxide is manufactured almost exclusively by the anthraquinone process, which was formalized in 1936 and patented in 1939.

This study was carried out to compare the influence of diluents and side groups of the extractants on complex formation. Three different diluents, nitrobenzene, octanol and cyclohexanone, and two extractants, C 5 -BTBP and CyMe 4 -BTBP, were selected for this experiment. It was found that the change of the diluent and of the substituent on the BTBP moiety does not modify the stoichiometry of the complexes which is L 2 M(NO 3) 3. It is proposed that one nitrate is directly coordinated to the metal ion, the two other anions probably remaining in the outer coordination sphere. The difference observed in extracting properties is probably due to the solvation of the complexes by the diluent. The noncovalent force that holds complexes together are likely to be largely governed by electrostatic interactions even if the hydrophobic exterior of the complexes {{plays an important role in}} the complexation/extraction mechanism.

COX has been extensively investigated, which has enabled the design of non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, acetaminophen (ApAP) and ibuprofen. However, there are still fundamental questions surrounding the LOX family of enzymes, which has limited the development of isoform specific inhibitors. The structural basis and regio- and stereoselectivity of the LOX isoforms are not known. Herein, we describe two strategies to develop isoform-specific inhibitors of lipoxygenase. Efforts were focused on the synthesis of unnatural lipid derivatives, in which the methylene hydrogen atoms on the substrate were replaced with a moiety lacking a <b>labile</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom,</b> such as fluorine. This would allow the LOX enzyme to remain in an active form, while preventing enzyme turnover. This preliminary work will enable the assessment of their activity as inhibitors and attempts at their co-crystallization might provide the first insight into the binding mode of these fatty acid substrates. The preparation of a small library of acylated 2 -aminopyrimidines and their efficacy as inhibitors of soybean lipoxygenase- 1 was explored. Preliminary studies suggest the mode of action occurs through a bi-dentate coordination of the ferric iron atom. Modifications of the acylated 2 -aminopyrimidines to make it more substrate-like and to increase its lipophilicity, yielded inhibitors with low micromolar IC 50 values. With further optimization, acyl 2 -aminopyrimidines could serve as a useful platform for the discovery of safe and efficient isoform specific inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|The amino−imino tautomerization of the nitrogen-linked {{conjugate}} 2 -methyltetrazole-saccharinate (2 MTS) {{was observed}} upon sublimation {{of the compound}} in vacuo. As shown previously by X-ray diffraction [Ismael, A.; Paixão, J. A.; Fausto, R.; Cristiano, M. L. S. J. Mol. Struct., 2011, 1023, 128 − 142], in the crystalline phase the compound exists in an amino-bridged tautomeric form. Infrared spectroscopic investigation of a cryogenic matrix prepared after sublimation of a crystalline sample of 2 MTS and deposition of the sublimate together with argon (in ∼ 1 : 1000 molar ratio) onto an IR-transparent cold (15 K) substrate, revealed that the form of 2 MTS present in the matrix corresponds to the theoretically predicted most stable imino-bridged tautomer. In this tautomer, the <b>labile</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom</b> {{is connected to the}} saccharine nitrogen, and the two heterocyclic fragments are linked by an imino moiety in which the double-bond is established with the carbon atom belonging to the saccharyl fragment. The observed isomeric form of this tautomer is characterized by a zusammen (Z) arrangement of the two rings around the CN bond of the bridging group and an intramolecular NH···N hydrogen bond. The experimental IR spectrum of the matrix-isolated 2 MTS has been fully assigned based on the calculated spectra for the two most stable conformers of this tautomer. A mechanism for the conversion of the tautomeric form existing in the crystal into that present in the gas phase is proposed.

To augment these experiments, molecular modeling was also conducted to identify likely deprotonation sites and potential gas-phase conformations of the anions. A majority of the 5 ′-monophosphates exchanged extensively with several of the compounds completely incorporating deuterium in place of their <b>labile</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms.</b> In contrast, most of the 3 ′-monophosphate isomers exchanged relatively few <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms,</b> even though {{the rate of the}} first two exchanges was greater than observed for the 5 ′-monophosphates.

Integration of the experimental and theoretical results supports the use of a relay exchange mechanism and suggests that the exchange behavior depends highly on the identity and orientation of the nucleobase and the position and flexibility of the deprotonated phosphate moiety. These observations also highlight the importance of the distance between the various participating groups in addition to their gas-phase acidity and basicity...|$|R

40|$|Over {{decades of}} {{carefully}} designed kinetic experiments {{and the development}} of complementary theory, a more or less complete picture of the mechanisms that govern emulsion polymerization systems has been established. This required means of determining the rate coefficients for the individual processes as functions of controllable variables such as initiator concentration and particle size, means of interpreting the data with a minimum of model-based assumptions, and the need to perform experiments that had the potential to actually refute a given mechanistic hypothesis. Significant advances have been made within the area of understanding interfacial processes such as radical entry and exit into and out of an emulsion polymerization particle, for electrostatic, steric and electrosteric stabilizers (the latter two being poorly understood until recently). The mechanism for radical exit is chain transfer to monomer within the particle interior to form a monomeric radical which can either diffuse into the water phase or propagate to form a more hydrophobic species which cannot exit. Entry is through aqueous-phase propagation of a radical derived directly from initiator, until a critical degree of polymerization z is reached; the value of z is such that the z-meric species is sufficiently surface active so that its only fate is to enter, whereas smaller aqueous-phase radical species can either be terminated in the aqueous phase or undergo further propagation. For both entry and exit, in the presence of (electro) steric stabilizers, two additional events are significant: transfer involving a <b>labile</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atom</b> within the stabilizing layer to form a mid-chain radical which is slow to propagate and quick to terminate, and which may also undergo β-scission to form a water-soluble species. Proper consideration of the fates of the various aqueous-phase radicals is essential for understanding the overall kinetic behaviour. Intra-particle termination is explained in terms of diffusion-controlled chain-length-dependent events. A knowledge of the events controlling entry and exit, including the recent discoveries of the additional mechanisms operating with (electro) steric stabilizers, provides an extension to the micellar and homogeneous nucleation models which enables particle number to be predicted with acceptable reliability, and also quantifies the amount of secondary nucleation occurring during seeded growth. This knowledge provides tools to understand the kinetics of emulsion polymerization, in both conventional and controlled/living polymerization systems, and to optimize reaction conditions to synthesize better polymer products...|$|E

40|$|Protein amide {{hydrogen}} exchange (HDX) is a convoluted process, whose kinetics {{is determined}} by both dynamics of the protein and the intrinsic exchange rate of <b>labile</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms</b> fully exposed to solvent. Both processes are influenced {{by a variety of}} intrinsic and extrinsic factors. A mathematical formalism initially developed to rationalize exchange kinetics of individual amide <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms</b> is now often used to interpret global exchange kinetics (e. g., as measured in HDX MS experiments). One particularly important advantage of HDX MS is direct visualization of various protein states by observing distinct protein ion populations with different levels of isotope labeling under conditions favoring correlated exchange (the so-called EX 1 exchange mechanism). However, mildly denaturing conditions often lead to a situation where the overall HDX kinetics cannot be clearly classified as either EX 1 or EX 2. The goal of this work is to develop a framework for a generalized exchange model that takes into account multiple processes leading to amide hydrogen exchange, and does not require that the exchange proceed strictly via EX 1 or EX 2 kinetics. To achieve this goal, we use a probabilistic approach that assigns a transition probability and a residual protection to each equilibrium state of the protein. When applied to a small protein chymotrypsin inhibitor 2, the algorithm allows complex HDX patterns observed experimentally to be modeled with remarkably good fidelity. On the basis of the model we are now in a position to begin to extract quantitative dynamic information from convoluted exchange kinetics...|$|R

Both charged ammonium groups in these diammonium compounds interact with the halide anion resulting in an ionic hydrogen bond (IHB) stretching frequency outside of the spectral frequency range that can be measured with the free-electron laser (FEL). This frequency is shifted into the spectral range upon exchanging all of the <b>labile</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms</b> with deuterium atoms, thus making measurement of the ionic deuterium bond (IDB) stretching frequency possible. The IDB stretching frequency shifts to higher values with increasing halide-anion size, methylation of the ammonium groups, and alkane chain length, consistent with the halide-anion-deuterium bond strength decreasing with decreasing gas-phase basicity of the halide anion and the increasing gas-phase basicity of the ammonium groups. The IDB stretching frequency also depends on the alkane chain length owing to constraints on {{the angle of the}} bonds between the halide anion and the two ammonium groups. There are additional bands in the IDB stretching feature in the IRMPD spectra, which are attributed to Fermi resonances and arise from coupling with overtone or combination bands that can be identified from theory and depend on the halide-anion identity and alkane chain length...|$|R

Cellulose is a polymer formed by (1 - 4) -linked {beta}-D-glucosyl residues that are alternately rotated by 180 o along the polymer axis to form flat ribbon-like chains. Each glucosyl unit bears three hydroxyl groups, one an hydroxymethyl group. It has been long recognized that these hydroxyl groups and their ability to bond via hydrogen bonding not only {{play a major role in}} directing how the crystal structure of cellulose forms but also in governing important physical properties of cellulose materials. Through the development of new techniques we have been able to prepare fiber samples of cellulose with exceptionally high order. The quality of these samples is allowing us to exploit the unique properties of synchrotron X-ray and neutron sources in order to collect diffraction data to near atomic resolution. Synchrotron X-rays are used to provide accurate crystallographic parameters for C and O atoms. However, because of the relatively weak scattering power of H atoms for X-rays, neutrons are used to determine H atom parameters. We have developed methods for replacing labile H atoms with D, without any loss in crystalline perfection. Deuterated fibers can diffract neutrons with intensities that are substantially different from the intensities diffracted from hydrogenated fibers. These differences, along with the phases calculated from the C and O positions determined in our X-ray studies, are used to calculate Fourier difference syntheses in which density associated with <b>labile</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms</b> is imaged.

These positive properties {{are due to}} the pendant hydroxyl groups which dominate the chemistry of the polymer {{but they can also}} lead to one major disadvantage, the polymer in water will show aging. The aging or syneresis is due to the polymer chains coming together to form crystalline regions and forcing the weakly bonded water molecules between the chains out. This effect can be countered upon the addition of solvents that interact with the polymer chains more strongly which helps to maintain the polymer network in a more amorphous state. Therefore the effect of solvents was investigated in various poly(vinyl alcohol) network states, from solution to gel and film. The solvents could be divided based on their ability to donate <b>labile</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms,</b> protic or aprotic, or on their relative size.

Such amounts of material continuously increase protein database sizes. At present, 22 times more protein sequences {{are available in the}} SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL databases than 8 years ago in SWISS-PROT. One of the methods of choice for protein identification makes use of specific endoproteolytic cleavage followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometric (MALDI-MS) analysis of the digested product. Since 1993, when this technique was first demonstrated, the conditions required for a correct identification have changed dramatically. Whilst 4 - 5 peptides with an uncertainty of 2 - 3 Da were sufficient for a correct identification in 1993, 10 - 13 peptides with less than 60 ppm mass error are now required for human and E. coli proteins. This evolution {{is directly related to the}} continuous increase in protein database sizes, which causes an increase in the number of false positive matches in identification results.

The exchange reaction with optimised techniques has shown an average 95 % of hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange on tryptic peptides. This level of exchange was sufficient to single out one or more peptides from a list of potential candidate proteins due to the dependence of H/D exchange on the peptide primary structure.

40|$|AbstractTriple {{differential}} cross sections (TDCS) for the ionization of metastable 2 P-state <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms</b> by electrons are calculated for various kinematic {{conditions in the}} asymmetric coplanar geometry. In this calculation, the final state is described by a multiple-scattering theory for ionization of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms</b> by electrons. Results show qualitative agreement with the available experimental data {{and those of other}} theoretical computational results for ionization of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms</b> from ground state, and our first Born results. There is no available other theoretical results and experimental data for ionization of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms</b> from the 2 P state. The present study offers a wide scope for the experimental study for ionization of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atoms</b> from the metastable 2 P state...|$|R
