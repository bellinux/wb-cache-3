25|$|The Restoration moderated most of {{the more}} strident sectarian writing, but radicalism persisted after the Restoration. Puritan authors such as John Milton were forced to retire from public life or adapt, and those Diggers, Fifth Monarchist, <b>Leveller,</b> Quaker, and Anabaptist authors who had preached against monarchy and who had participated {{directly}} in the regicide of Charles I were partially suppressed. Consequently, violent writings were forced underground, {{and many of those}} who had served in the Interregnum attenuated their positions in the Restoration.|$|E
25|$|A {{manifesto}} {{was proposed}} entitled An Agreement of the People, and at an open meeting in Putney the {{officers of the}} Army Council heard the argument from private soldiers for a transparent, democratic state, without corruption. Proposals included sovereignty for English citizens, Parliamentary seats distributed according to population rather than property ownership, religion made a free choice, equality before the law, conscription abolished and parliamentary elections held every year. While the ideas proved greatly influential, including inspiring much {{of the language of}} the United States Declaration of Independence, Oliver Cromwell would later have the <b>Leveller</b> leaders executed.|$|E

25|$|John Lilburne {{was the son}} of Richard Lilburne, a {{landowner}} of estates at Thickley Punchardon {{and elsewhere}} in County Durham. He was probably born in Sunderland but the exact date of his birth is unknown; there is some dispute as to whether he was born in 1613, 1614, or 1615. His father Richard Lilburne was the last man in England to insist that he should be allowed to settle a legal dispute with a trial by combat. John's elder brother Robert Lilburne also later became active in the Parliamentary cause, but seems not to have shared John's <b>Leveller</b> beliefs. By his own account Lilburne received the first ten years' of his education in Newcastle, almost certainly at the Royal Free Grammar School. He also had some schooling in Bishop Auckland.|$|E
25|$|After an {{incredible}} championship, which saw the three favourites fail to {{even make the}} semi-final stage, Cork and Clare emerged {{at the top of}} the pile to contest the All-Ireland final. In front of a crowd of 81,651, Clare started brightly with early scores from Darach Honan and Colin Ryan. Clare led by 0-12 to 0-10 at the break, and they continued to bring a remarkable intensity to the contest, forcing the Rebels into errors, which they exploited with further scores from Tony Kelly and the unerring Ryan, who steered over his sixth free for a four-point lead. Cork were far from finished, however, and when Pa Cronin saw his chance, he picked his spot with an accurate finish to the net, and the sides were level going into the final five minutes. Patrick Horgan appeared to have won it for them with his tenth score in stoppage-time, but there was still time for Domhnall O'Donovan to pop up with a dramatic <b>leveller</b> in the 73rd minute.|$|E
25|$|Socialist historians in the 20th century revived {{interest}} in the Levellers and the popular historian and journalist H. N. Brailsford mentioned both Katherine and Samuel Chidley several times in his book on the subject, written in the 1950s. Ian Gentles contributed an important article on the Chidleys to The Journal of Ecclesiastical History in 1978, going on the write the article on Katharine for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography in 2004. By this time, she was becoming an important subject for Feminist historians. Katharine Gillespie of Miami University, who has sought to give serious weight to Biblical and theological perspectives, edited a facsimile edition of her writings, published in 2009. Interest {{is not confined to}} the Left: Chidley's centrality in discussion of the separation of Church and State has brought her {{to the attention of the}} Online Library of Liberty, sponsored by the Right Libertarian Liberty Fund, which is in the process of publishing her main works online. The Justification and A New-Yeares-Gift have been made available for free by the Text Creation Partnership in searchable and paginated online versions. As a result of the widespread interest, Chidley is now mentioned in general histories of the 17th century. A notable example, is episode 9 of Simon Schama's BBC History of Britain (at 12:30 minutes into the episode), and the supporting book, which gives consideration to Chidley and <b>Leveller</b> women more generally.|$|E

500|$|The radical {{groups that}} flourished {{during this period}} held differing {{opinions}} of Magna Carta. The Levellers rejected history and law as presented by their contemporaries, holding instead to an [...] "anti-Normanism" [...] viewpoint. John Lilburne, for example, argued that Magna Carta contained {{only some of the}} freedoms that had supposedly existed under the Anglo-Saxons before being crushed by the Norman yoke. The <b>Leveller</b> Richard Overton described the charter as [...] "a beggarly thing containing many marks of intolerable bondage". Both saw Magna Carta as a useful declaration of liberties that could be used against governments they disagreed with. Gerrard Winstanley, the leader of the more extreme Diggers, stated [...] "the best lawes that England hath, [...] were got by our Forefathers importunate petitioning unto the kings that still were their Task-masters; and yet these best laws are yoaks and manicles, tying one sort of people to be slaves to another; Clergy and Gentry have got their freedom, but the common people still are, and have been left servants to work for them." ...|$|E

On 29 April 1649 the English Council of State committed to prison the <b>Leveller</b> leaders John Lilburne, Richard Overton, William Walwyn and Thomas Prince, who owned a book critical of the regime, England's New Chains. The House of Commons agreed that they should be tried under Common Law on 11 April. The House was under a constant bombardment of petitions on behalf of the arrested Levellers, and women mobilised in numbers. On 23 April Bulstrode Whitelocke observed: ...|$|E

For example, <b>levels</b> 1-1 to 1-4 are repeated as <b>levels</b> 4-1 to 4-4, but <b>level</b> 4-5 is added. <b>Levels</b> 4-1 to 4-5 are repeated as <b>levels</b> 7-1 to 7-5, but <b>level</b> 7-6 is added.

50|$|These <b>levels</b> are {{classified}} as <b>Level</b> 1, <b>Level</b> 2 or <b>Level</b> 3.

Rainsborowe showed his <b>Leveller</b> convictions during the army's Putney Debates at the end of October. [...] William's brother, Thomas Rainborowe, was more fiery in his <b>Leveller</b> speeches, and he was murdered by Royalists in a bungled kidnap attempt in Doncaster in October 1648. [...] William led the funeral, and a pamphlet called The Second Part of Englands New Chaines Discovered of that year discussed Rainsborowe's attempts at finding justice and the resistance of the upper classes.
