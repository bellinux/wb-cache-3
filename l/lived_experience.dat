5|$|Feminism in {{psychology}} {{emerged as a}} critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects. As women earned doctorates {{in psychology}}, females and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, <b>lived</b> <b>experience,</b> and qualitative analysis. Projects such as Psychology's Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.|$|E
25|$|Psychology of the sacred, {{taking stock}} of the human condition, conveys that people {{construct}} meaning from that which is without meaning; stated differently, culture gives context to <b>lived</b> <b>experience.</b> Therefore, both meaning and absence of meaning {{may be perceived as}} being co-existents. Cultural context as constructed meaning and memetic transmission engenders social, existential, and spiritual comfort in a tenuous and arbitrary <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> and millieu: perception as a participatory event parsing experience into meaningful units. The crossroads or intersections of evolutionary psychology of religion, pattern recognition, neuroaesthetics and symbolic communication lend to the construction of meanings as group cohesion and bond-forming in human society.|$|E
25|$|Progressive Christianity is a {{contemporary}} movement {{which seeks to}} remove the supernatural claims of the faith {{and replace them with}} a post-critical understanding of biblical spirituality based on historical and scientific research. It focuses on the <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of spirituality over historical dogmatic claims, and accepts that the faith is both true and a human construction, and that spiritual experiences are psychologically and neurally real and useful.|$|E

25|$|Star {{has been}} {{particularly}} influential {{in the area of}} information infrastructure, frequently noting that although the study of infrastructure often entails examining things that seem commonplace, those everyday items have widespread consequences for humans and human interaction. Star has worked to develop ways of understanding how people communicate about infrastructure, and has helped develop research methods aimed to examine the role infrastructure plays in mediated human activities. But her work extends far beyond the realm of information infrastructure. Star's interest in the connection between technology and <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> led her to work in a wide array of disciplines, including library sciences, computer sciences, neuroscience, philosophy and women's studies.|$|E
25|$|In {{light of}} the fact that Metzinger frequented the Bateau Lavoir since 1908 and {{exhibited}} with Georges Braque at Berthe Weill's gallery, introduced to Picasso by Max Jacob and Guillaume Krotowsky (who already signed his works Guillaume Apollinaire), and in view of the similarities between the two works, it is probable that Metzinger's Bathers was painted the same year; 1908. The differences between the two paintings suggest that, while Metzinger may have been influenced by Picasso (unlike Albert Gleizes), his intention was certainly not to copy or even resemble the Spaniard, as would soon Braque (or visa versa). His intention was to create his own brand of art, dependent on his own <b>lived</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E
25|$|Its {{philosophy}} has been sketched {{out in a}} number of articles and interviews. The key ideas are those of a politics of the poor, a living politics and a people's politics. A politics of the poor is understood to mean a politics that is conducted by the poor and for the poor in a manner that enables the poor to be active participants in the struggles conducted in their name. Practically, it means that such a politics must be conducted where poor people live or in places that they can easily access, at the times when they are free, in the languages that they speak. It does not mean that middle-class people and organisations are excluded but that they are expected to come to these spaces and to undertake their politics there in a dialogical and democratic manner. There are two key aspects {{to the idea of a}} living politics. The first is that it is understood as a politics that begins not from external theory but from the experience of the people that shape it. It is argued that political education usually operates to create new elites who mediate relationships of patronage upwards and who impose ideas on others and to exclude ordinary people from thinking politically. This politics is not anti-theory – it just asserts the need to begin from <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> and to move on from there rather than to begin from theory (usually imported from the Global North) and to impose theory on the <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of suffering and resistance in the shacks. The second key aspect, of a living politics, is that political thinking is always undertaken democratically and in common. People's politics is opposed to party politics or politicians' politics (as well as to top down undemocratic forms of NGO politics) and it is argued that the former is a popular democratic project undertaken without financial reward and with an explicit refusal of representative roles and personal power while the latter is a top down, professionalised representative project driven by personal power.|$|E

500|$|In general, {{science in}} {{continental}} philosophy is viewed from a world-historical perspective. [...] One {{of the first}} philosophers who supported this view was Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Philosophers such as Pierre Duhem and Gaston Bachelard also wrote their works with this world-historical approach to science, predating Kuhn by a generation or more. All of these approaches involve a historical and sociological turn to science, with a priority on <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> (a kind of Husserlian [...] "life-world"), rather than a progress-based or anti-historical approach as done in the analytic tradition. This emphasis can be traced through Edmund Husserl's phenomenology, the late works of Merleau-Ponty (Nature: Course Notes from the Collège de France, 1956–1960), and Martin Heidegger's hermeneutics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{movement}} describes {{itself as}} [...] "a homemade politics {{that everyone can}} understand and find a home in" [...] and stresses that it moves from the <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of the poor to create a politics that is both intellectual and actional.|$|E

Consequently, {{much of the}} subject matter of {{psychology}} lends itself to qualitative approaches (e.g. the <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of grief), and quantitative methods are mainly appropriate when something can be counted without leveling the phenomena (e.g. the length of time spent crying).|$|E

2500|$|The Second Sex (...) is a 1949 book by the French existentialist Simone de Beauvoir, {{in which}} the author {{discusses}} the treatment of women throughout history. Beauvoir researched and wrote the book in about 14 months when she was 38 years old. She published it in two volumes, Facts and Myths and <b>Lived</b> <b>Experience</b> (Les faits et les mythes and L'expérience vécue in French). Some chapters first appeared in Les Temps modernes. One of Beauvoir's best-known books, The Second Sex is often regarded as a major work of feminist philosophy and {{the starting point of}} second-wave feminism.|$|E
2500|$|Two of Jameson's best-known claims from Postmodernism {{are that}} postmodernity is {{characterized}} by pastiche and a crisis in historicity. Jameson argued that parody (which implies a moral judgment or a comparison with societal norms) was replaced by pastiche (collage {{and other forms of}} juxtaposition without a normative grounding). Relatedly, Jameson argued that the postmodern era suffers from a crisis in historicity: [...] "there no longer does seem to be any organic relationship between the American history we learn from schoolbooks and the <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of the current, multinational, high-rise, stagflated city of the newspapers and of our own everyday life".|$|E
2500|$|West {{has called}} the U.S. a [...] "racist patriarchal" [...] nation where white {{supremacy}} continues to define everyday life. [...] "White America," [...] he writes, [...] "has been historically weak-willed in ensuring racial justice and has continued to resist fully accepting the humanity of blacks." [...] This has resulted, he says, {{in the creation of}} many [...] "degraded and oppressed people hungry for identity, meaning, and self-worth." [...] West attributes most of the black community's problems to [...] "existential angst derive from the <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of ontological wounds and emotional scars inflicted by white supremacist beliefs and images permeating U.S. society and culture." ...|$|E

2500|$|Inversely, once a steadfast {{supporter}} of Cubism, André Salmon in 1917-18 predicted too its demise; claiming {{it to have}} been merely a phase leading to a new art-form more closely attuned with nature. Two more former advocates of Cubism had also defected, [...] and Blaise Cendrars, joining the ranks of Vauxcelles in frontline attacks on Cubism. Allard reproached the visible distancing of Cubism from the dynamism and diversity of <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> toward a universe of purified objects. Similarly, Cendrars wrote {{in an article published}} May 1919 [...] "The formulae of the Cubists' are becoming too narrow, and can no longer embrace the personality of the painters".|$|E
2500|$|Historians {{working in}} the Humboldtian {{tradition}} developed ideas that would become central in Boasian anthropology. Leopold von Ranke defined {{the task of the}} historian as [...] "merely to show as it actually was", which is a cornerstone of Boas's empiricism. Wilhelm Dilthey emphasized the centrality of [...] "understanding" [...] to human knowledge, and that the <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of an historian could provide a basis for an empathic understanding of the situation of an historical actor. For Boas, both values were well-expressed in a quote from Goethe: [...] "A single action or event is interesting, not because it is explainable, but because it is true." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Georgescu's novels, the {{strictly}} fictional {{was often}} found {{side by side}} with concrete autobiographical elements. The recipe was noted by critic Lucian Raicu: [...] "the bookish as much as the intimately <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> [...] ". Raicu adds: [...] "The sense of abundant, diverse, life, of a fascinating materiality, endlessly harasses the habits of the bookish man, who lives among models and masterpieces as if in his element, and eventually fuses with them". Georgescu's works, alongside those of Norman Manea, were also case studies for literary historian Liviu Petrescu, who documented the extent of self-referential and intransitive prose in Romanian postmodernism. Manea cites Ion Simuţ in discussing the main topic of Georgescu's narratives: [...] "A dynamic rationale facing a world lacking in dynamism, [...] almost inert." ...|$|E
