40|$|Eight Arabian stallions were {{selected}} from clinically normal horses. After 10 day adaptation period the animals {{were divided into two}} equal groups: control and experimental. All horses were housed individually and allowed to walk on sandy paddock twice a day between meals. Both groups were fed the same diet which was composed of 6 kg hay and 4 kg barley. However, the experimental group was supplemented with 150 g of micronutrient premix. Premix was composed of 180 g of oats husk meal, 260 g dicalcium phosphate as carrier, 25 g <b>lignosulphate...</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{report by}} the Swedish EPA (Environmental Protection Administration) rates {{the quality of the}} Nemunas in Lithuania as {{moderately}} polluted or polluted. High concentrations of organic pollutants, nitrates and phosphates occur {{in different parts of the}} river. Environmental issues include water quality (eutrophication and pollutants), changes in the hydrological regime, and flooding control. The environmental problems in each of the countries that make up the basin are slightly different. In Belarus, the main problems are oil products as well as nitrogen and BOD (biological oxygen demand). The environmental issues in the Kaliningrad section include high concentrations of BOD, <b>lignosulphates,</b> and nitrogen. In Lithuania, the operations of the Kaunas Hydroelectric Power Plant cause changes of the water level that affect the riparian ecosystem. Old wastewater treatment facilities along the entire river also contribute to pollution.|$|R
