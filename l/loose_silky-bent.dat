40|$|<b>Loose</b> <b>silky-bent</b> grass (Apera spica-venti) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} grass weeds in Bavaria. Effective chemical weed control is essential to prevent loss of yield and harvest quality in winter cereals. Crop rotations with more winter cereals and reduced soil cultivation caused a higher infestation of <b>loose</b> <b>silky-bent</b> in arable farming regions. Effects of herbicide resistance were observed since the last 15 years. Herbicide resistance of <b>loose</b> <b>silky-bent</b> is well observed by the official plant protection service of Bavaria. A wide experience of resistance tests shows the development of resistant <b>loose</b> <b>silky-bent</b> grass and provides an opportunity for future prospects in resistance dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Herbicide {{resistance}} {{has increased}} dramatically all over the world. Especially North America, South America and Australia are affected. In {{the last few years}} also in Europe different active ingredient groups become more and more ineffectively. The risk of resistance is very high for the ACC-ase inhibitors (Group A), the photosynthese- inhibitors (Group C) and by now also for the ALS - inhibitors (Group B). In almost every agricultural region of Lower Saxony the <b>loose</b> <b>silky-bent</b> grass (Apera spica-venti) shows resistance to at least one mode of action. Since 2005 especially in the lower saxonian region between Osnabrück, Hannover and Braunschweig resistance in <b>loose</b> <b>silky-bent</b> grass against the ALS- inhibitors occurs. 2012 target site resistance against Pinoxaden was found for the first time. In the last few years also in Europe different active ingredient groups became more and more ineffectively...|$|E
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2014, panicles from <b>loose</b> <b>silky-bent</b> grass (Apera spica-venti) were {{collected}} at 109 sites across the federal state Hessen, to analyze the level of <b>loose</b> <b>silky-bent</b> grass resistance against herbicides from HRAC-class A, B and F 1 /K 3. Panicles from established spraying windows as well as panicles from A. spica-venti patches, which were identified at time of harvest within cereal fields, were included into the monitoring. In December 2014 the <b>loose</b> <b>silky-bent</b> grass seeds were seeded into pots {{and placed in the}} greenhouse of plant protection service Hessen in Wetzlar. The young seedlings were sprayed (repeated) with herbicides from HRAC group A, B and F 1 /K 3 at BBCH-stages which provided optimal efficacy for each individual herbicide. Efficacy was rated. Each biotype was tested for well-known mutations, which modify the amino acid sequence of acetolactate-synthase (ALS). Biotypes, in which the herbicide from HRAC group A reached low efficacy, were tested for well-known mutations in the acetyl coenzyme a carboxylase (ACCase) gene. The treatments with the herbicide from HRAC group F 1 /K 3 reached very high efficacy up to 100 % in nearly all biotypes. The herbicide treatment with an herbicide from HRAC group A reached high efficacy in most cases. However, all herbicides from HRAC group B showed very low efficacy. Only 12 biotypes could be controlled with an efficacy of more than 90 %. 45 biotypes contained several mutations in the ALS gene, which cause ALS-resistance. Only one biotype contained a mutation, which can cause ACCase resistance. These results will be used to study reasons for development of resistance in order to develop guidance information to prevent further increase of resistance...|$|E
40|$|In {{winter rye}} which is grown mostly on {{locations}} with a lighter soil texture <b>loose</b> <b>silky-bent</b> grass (Apera spica-venti) is a dominate weed grass. Because of increasing herbicide resistance {{the control of}} A. spica-venti becomes more difficult. To manage resistant weed grass populations in winter rye flufenacet {{is a very important}} active substance. However, the application of flufenacet can lead to substantially culture damage. The influence of different factors influencing the tolerance of flufenacet applications in rye was proved in field trails carried out by the Landwirtschaftskammer Niedersachsen over several years. The degree of damage of culture increased with a higher amount of flufenacet being applicated. Damage, loss of plants and yield loss caused by flufenacet application differed between grown varieties of rye. The highest damage of culture was found on sandy soils with lowest humus content. The size of rye seed had no influence on the degree of damage or yield loss of rye caused by flufenacet application. Options to use flufenacet well-tolerated for winter rye are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Summary 	Organic farming means {{a chance}} for plants to reveal their abilities. We offer better {{conditions}} to the associated plants for their growth and reproduction by no use of chemical herbicides and by using alternative growing methods. 	Organic agrophytocoenoses are significant by higher species richness and cover. There can be found some of endangered species among the weeds, which may be more successful in organic system, therfore the organic type of farming may serve for their protection. The most successful weed species endanger cultural crops on both organic and conventional fields. They become more dangerous {{without the possibility of}} herbicide application. Thanks to this, the strategy of each plant species is more important. That is why the question of weed suppression in organic farming is highly important and frequently asked. 	The aim of this thesis is to analyse weed flora on organic cereals fields and to point out possible factors influencing them. Braun-Blanquet scale of dominance and abundance has been used for the assessment of weed communities. Several different localities were investigated in Benešov district. Influence of winter cereals, spring cereals, previous crop and the tillage system have been assessed. 	Some of the most important weed species were: annual winter weed species in winter cereals, perennials and few annual spring species in spring cereals. Annual weeds were typical for spring cereals sown two years on a one plot, perennials were associated with spring cereals sown after fodder crops. -There were not found any evident differences in weed spectrum in winter cereals based on previous crop. Agrophytocoenosis on fields with conventional and reduced tillage differed. Wider spectrum of perennial species was typical for fields where reduced tillage was applied, differences in annual weed spectrum were also found. Typical species for conventional tillage were for example: marsh woundwort, common couch-grass and common poppy, while, creeping thistle, creeping buttercup, perennial sow-thistle, mugwort, corn chamomile, <b>loose</b> <b>silky-bent</b> and some others were often found on fields where reduced tillage were used. 	The results of the analysis in this thesis mostly lead to the same description of weeds as in literature, but few of the results are different. Thanks to statistically decisive results, it is apparent, how a farmer can affect the plant associations over a long period. Key words: organic farming, weeds, agrophytocoenosis, cereals, weed control, features(characteristic) of weeds...|$|E
