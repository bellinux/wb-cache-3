5000|$|... “No {{need to make}} folks think I <b>like</b> <b>fancy</b> foods <b>like</b> quail on toast, {{chicken and}} hot biscuits, or steak smothered in mushrooms. Of course they taste good and I can eat them, but have you ever tried ham hocks and red beans?” -Louis Armstrong, as quoted in A Date with a Dish ...|$|R

5000|$|Valdes's celebrity clients {{included}} Josephine Baker, Mae West, Ella Fitzgerald, Dorothy Dandridge, Eartha Kitt, and Marian Anderson. [...] According to Valdes, [...] "I only fit Fitzgerald once in 12 years. I had to {{do everything}} by imagination for her. She <b>liked</b> <b>fancy</b> clothes with beads and appliques. I'd {{just look at the}} papers and say, 'Gee, she's gotten larger.'" [...] Valdes also created a new sexier image for singer Joyce Bryant who LIFE Magazine dubbed “the Black Marilyn Monroe." ...|$|R

6000|$|Ileen was a {{strictly}} vegetable compound, guaranteed under the Pure Ambrosia and Balm-of-Gilead Act {{of the year}} of the fall of Adam. She was a fruit-stand blonde--strawberries, peaches, cherries, etc. Her eyes were wide apart, and she possessed the calm that precedes a storm that never comes. But {{it seems to me that}} words (at any rate per) are wasted in an effort to describe the beautiful. <b>Like</b> <b>fancy,</b> [...] "It is engendered in the eyes." [...] There are three kinds of beauties--I was foreordained to be homiletic; I can never stick to a story.|$|R
50|$|Fox, <b>like</b> <b>Fancy</b> and Pretty, {{was sent}} away to {{boarding}} school at a young age. Fox was popular and excelled at swimming, {{but he was also}} a trouble-maker, and Julian and Ivy eventually sent him to Europe to attend school. After graduating from boarding school, Fox went on to attend university, but eventually became bored with his studies and dropped out, taking up gambling to keep himself occupied. Fox quickly gambled his trust fund away, however, and, upon seeing a news report regarding Ethan's marriage to Gwen Hotchkiss, he decides to finally return to Harmony.|$|R

6000|$|... "Allow me to differ. A {{permanent}} work society numbering {{a few women}} otherwise unemployed may find a sufficient sale in the neighbourhood under the patronage of charitable ladies; but when you throw in ninety-five or one hundred pair of hands depending on their work for their livelihood, the supply must necessarily soon go beyond any demand, even fictitious. It will not do to think of these women <b>like</b> <b>fancy</b> knitters or embroiderers whose work is skilled. Most of them can hardly mend their own clothes, and the utmost that can be expected {{of them is the}} roughest slop work." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fashion is {{a popular}} style or practice, {{especially}} in clothing, footwear, accessories, makeup, body, or furniture. Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style {{in which a person}} dresses. It is the prevailing styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers. Because the more technical term costume is regularly linked to the term [...] "fashion", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses <b>like</b> <b>fancy</b> dress or masquerade wear, while [...] "fashion" [...] generally means clothing, including the study of it. Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; and {{we always}} <b>like</b> to <b>fancy</b> {{something}} pathetic in the fate of pretty girls that other fellows marry. I notice that we don't sorrow much over the plain ones. How's the divine Clara?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nope. That's {{one thing}} I won't stand for, Saxon. Not that I don't <b>like</b> <b>fancy</b> work. I do. I like it like hell, every bit you make, but I like it on YOU. Go ahead and make {{all you want}} of it, for yourself, an' I'll put up for the goods. Why, I'm just whistlin' an' happy all day long, thinkin' of the boy an' seein' you at home here workin' away on all them nice things. Because I know how happy you are a-doin' it. But honest to God, Saxon, it'd all be spoiled if I knew you was doin' it to sell. You see, Bill Roberts' wife don't have to work. That's my brag--to myself, mind you. An' besides, it ain't right." ...|$|R
40|$|For {{the woman}} who <b>likes</b> <b>fancy</b> work, Italian hemstitching offers many {{variations}} of patterns and uses. It is lovely for luncheon sets, table covers or scarfs, and for finishing guest towels, and is especially effective on colored linens. In making towels one end might be finished with Italian hemstitching, {{and the other with}} plain hemstitching. One variation of the Italian work is to pull out two threads of material, leave four, pull eight, leave four, and pull two [...] Save the drawn threads and use them in making the hemstitching. In the rows where two threads were pulled. make plain hemstitching, in the other, catch each four threads together, then go over and fasten two of these groups together to form crosses...|$|R

5000|$|A January 2007 {{interview}} for NME, Noel Gallagher gave new details on {{his vision for}} the album: [...] "All the tunes I've written recently {{have been on the}} kind of acoustic side, you know? But for the next record I really fancy doing a record where we just completely throw the kitchen sink at it", he explained. [...] "We haven't done that since Be Here Now. I'd like to get, like, a 100-piece orchestra and choirs and all that stuff. I think since Standing on the Shoulder of Giants we've been trying to prove a point of just bass, drums, guitar and vocals and nothing fancy. But I kind of <b>like</b> <b>fancy!</b> I'd <b>like</b> to make an absolutely fucking colossal album. You know? Like literally two orchestras, stuff like that." ...|$|R

5000|$|An old English {{game called}} [...] "base" [...] or [...] "prisoners' base", {{described}} by George Ewing at Valley Forge, was apparently not much like baseball. There was no bat and no ball involved. The game was more <b>like</b> a <b>fancy</b> game of team [...] "tag", {{although it did}} share the concept of places of safety, bases, with baseball.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{can make}} the story so in your mind, Ezra, because you are great, and <b>like</b> to <b>fancy</b> the {{greatest}} that could be. But I think it was not really like that. The Jewish girl must have had jealousy in her heart, and she wanted somehow to have the {{first place in the}} king's mind. That is what she would die for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, too, I {{thought a}} little about myself.

60|$|John Gayther {{had never}} dug into a garden-bed as earnestly and anxiously as he now dug into his mind. These ladies were coming for a story. The younger one had doubtless {{told her mother}} {{that there had been}} stories told in the garden, and now another one was wanted, and it was more than likely that he was {{expected}} to tell it. But he did not feel at all easy about telling a story to the Mistress of the House. He knew her so well, and the habits of her mind, that he was fully assured if his fancies should blossom too luxuriantly she would ruthlessly pull them up and throw them on the path. Still he believed she would <b>like</b> <b>fancies,</b> and highly colored ones; but he must be very careful about them. They must be harmonious; they must not interfere with each other; they might be rare and wonderful, but he must not give them long Latin names which meant nothing.|$|R
