The {{applications}} of <b>lithium</b> <b>ions</b> {{as an agent}} to facilitate bone formation have been widely documented; however, the effect of <b>lithium</b> <b>ions</b> in the periodontitis model {{has not yet been}} elucidated. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to investigate the effect of single <b>lithium</b> <b>ions</b> in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A periodontitis model was induced in cementoblasts using LPS. The cytotoxic effect of the <b>lithium</b> <b>ions</b> on the cementoblasts was studied through the MTT assay. Alkaline phosphatase analysis and alizarin red staining were performed to investigate the effect of the <b>lithium</b> <b>ions</b> on differentiation. To examine the effect of <b>lithium</b> <b>ions</b> on osteoclastogenesis, osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) mRNA and protein expression levels were assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis and ELISA, respectively. Compared with the effect induced by <b>lithium</b> <b>ions</b> on normal cementoblasts, proliferation and differ-entiation were downregulated following the co-incubation of the cementoblasts with LPS and <b>lithium</b> <b>ions.</b> Furthermore, the <b>lithium</b> <b>ions</b> appeared to alter osteoclastogenesis by regulating the OPG/RANKL ratio. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that <b>lithium</b> <b>ions</b> can downregulate proliferation and differentiation in a periodontitis model. Further studies should be undertaken prior to the acceptance of <b>lithium</b> <b>ions</b> for use in the clinic...|$|R
40|$|Pharmaceuticals {{based on}} <b>lithium</b> <b>ions</b> have been already used in {{clinical}} practice for over 60 {{years for the}} treatment of bipolar disorders and remain a basic pharmacological therapy for patients with this disease.

Allison continued to take on Ph.D. candidates, some of whom, such as James Cronin went on to distinguished careers.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metal cations do {{not usually}} form {{coordination}} complexes with simple Lewis bases {{due to their}} low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li+ ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes). Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode. In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes (+), {{with the exception of}} the <b>lithium</b> <b>ion,</b> which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes (+); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants. Alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers (e.g. 12-crown-4 for Li+, 15-crown-5 for Na+, 18-crown-6 for K+, and 21-crown-7 for Rb+) and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are {{more similar to}} each other than the {{elements}} in any other group are to each other. Indeed, the similarity {{is so great that}} it is quite difficult to separate potassium, rubidium, and caesium, due to their similar ionic radii; lithium and sodium are more distinct. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium. One of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their reduction potentials: lithium's value is anomalous, being more negative than the others. This is because the Li+ ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase: though the <b>lithium</b> <b>ion</b> disrupts the structure of water significantly, causing a higher change in entropy, this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal, despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase.|$|E
