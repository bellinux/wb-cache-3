5|$|Amy {{is also a}} major {{character}} in the 2003–2006 anime series Sonic X. Attacking one of Eggman's machines, Sonic triggers Chaos Control and sends him, Amy, Tails and other characters from their world to Earth. On Earth, they befriend a human boy, Chris Thorndyke and his family and friends; Amy particularly <b>likes</b> <b>his</b> maid, Ella, who teaches her to cook. She frequently tries to woo Sonic and his discomfort angers her. In one episode Amy makes a seashell bracelet, which Sonic graciously accepts; shortly afterward he saves her from drowning, and she returns the favor when one of Eggman's robots holds him underwater. Sonic also rescues Amy from Eggman's creations on other occasions. She sometimes flares up at Sonic, attacking him when she realizes that he has tricked her into acting insane. The second season opens with arcs based on Adventure and Adventure 2, where Amy reprises {{her role in the}} games. During the first and second seasons Amy and her friends—often without Sonic—are frequently together, capturing (and recapturing) Chaos Emeralds from Doctor Eggman and adjusting to their celebrity status on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol <b>likes</b> <b>his</b> family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E

25|$|Job {{satisfaction}} is often thought {{to reflect the}} extent to which a worker <b>likes</b> <b>his</b> or her job, or individual aspects or facets of jobs. It is one of the most heavily researched topics in I/O psychology. Job satisfaction has theoretical and practical utility for the field. It has been linked to important job outcomes including attitudinal variables (e.g., job involvement, organizational commitment), absenteeism, turnover intentions, actual turnover, job performance, and tension. A meta-analyses found job satisfaction to be related to life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and the absence of negative affect.|$|E
500|$|Duncan himself {{commented on}} his [...] "boring" [...] image, stating: [...] "If you show excitement, then you also may show {{disappointment}} or frustration. If your opponent picks {{up on this}} frustration, you are at a disadvantage." [...] Sports journalist Kevin Kernan commented {{on his ability to}} relax and stay focused, stating that having a degree in psychology, Duncan often not only outplays, but out-psychs his opponents. Duncan has also stated that he especially <b>likes</b> <b>his</b> bank shot, saying: [...] "It is just easy for me. It just feels good." [...] Additionally, Duncan's close and longstanding relationship with Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has been described as [...] "the greatest love story in sports".|$|E
500|$|Jim's plan to {{consolidate}} three employee birthdays into a combined birthday party encounters several complications, and his constant adjustments incur {{the ire of}} Party Planning Committee chair Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey). [...] Later, Jim discovers that no one <b>likes</b> <b>his</b> idea for a combined party, realizing {{the depth of his}} error when Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) mistakenly refers to him as Michael, and he returns to the original plan of having separate parties. Michael and Dwight return lightening the mood amongst the employees and for the lighting of Creed Bratton's (portrayed by the actor of the same name) birthday cobbler, with Michael expressing that he no longer has any desire to return to the wilderness and Jim expressing his relief that Michael has returned to run the office.|$|E

500|$|As Lois is {{informed}} the sex education classes will be terminated, she exclaims [...] "Oh, no!", a cut-a-way scene then begins of {{a sports car}} driving along the road with music playing in the background, this is a reference to Knight Rider. When Stewie is using his toys in order to capture and kill the tooth fairy, the toys are SpongeBob from SpongeBob SquarePants, Starscream (from The Transformers) and Man-E-Faces, {{all of which are}} fictional characters for television programs. When Peter is watching television, he is watching the women shown on the episode are actually cartoon animations of the real actors for the show. [...] When Lois catches Chris and his friends watching a pornographic film, she tells them that without sex education, they can easily become sexually confused. [...] The scene cuts to Michael Jackson in his childhood form eating a bowl of Frosted Mini-Wheats, saying that he likes the frosted side, while the grown-up in him <b>likes</b> <b>his</b> younger self. [...] When Lois teaches a sex education class, Peter uses a bust of William Shakespeare and a Rainbow Brite doll to demonstrate sexual intercourse. In the scene where Stewie loses a tooth, everybody comes in and tells him to calm down, then it shows a long line of characters, mimicking a scene from the movie Airplane!. While doing a news story on ear sex, Diane tells Tom that [...] is on Thursdays. When Brian talks about Jillian's bulimia, he mentions the death of singer Karen Carpenter, who died from anorexia in 1983. When Stewie thinks that Brian is the Tooth Fairy, Brian substantiates his identity by telling Stewie he has a picture of Chris Noth in his wallet, known for his role on Law & Order.|$|E
2500|$|No {{farewell}} scenes for Emma Peel {{had been}} shot when Diana Rigg left the series. Rigg was recalled for [...] "The Forget-Me-Knot", through which Emma acts as Steed's partner as usual. Rigg also filmed a farewell scene for Emma which appeared as the tag scene of the episode. It was explained that Emma's husband, Peter Peel, was found alive and rescued, and she left the British secret service to be with him. Emma visits Steed to say goodbye, and while leaving she passes Tara on the stairway giving the advice that [...] "He <b>likes</b> <b>his</b> tea stirred anti-clockwise." [...] Steed {{looks out the window}} as a departing Emma enters the Bentley driven by Peter– who from a distance seems to resemble Steed (and was played by Steed's regular stunt-double, with bowler hat and umbrella).|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} a work song that was shared between several contexts, including, eventually, sailors working, is [...] "Grog Time o' Day." [...] This song, the tune of which is now lost, was sung by: Jamaican stevedores at a capstan in 1811; Afro-Caribbeans rowing a boat in Antigua ca.1814; Black stevedores loading a {{steamboat}} in New Orleans in 1841; and a Euro-American crew hauling halyards on a clipper-brig out of New York ca.1840s. Other such multi-job songs were: [...] "Round the Corn(er), Sally," [...] "Fire Down Below," [...] "Johnny Come Down to Hilo," [...] "Hilo, Boys, Hilo," [...] "Tommy's Gone Away," [...] "The Sailor <b>Likes</b> <b>His</b> Bottle-O," [...] "Highland Laddie," [...] "Mudder Dinah," [...] "Bully in the Alley," [...] "Hogeye Man," [...] "Good Morning, Ladies, All," [...] "Pay Me the Money Down," [...] "Alabama, John Cherokee," [...] "Yankee John, Stormalong," [...] and [...] "Heave Away (My Johnnies)." ...|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Drug Testing", Dwight {{states that}} he <b>likes</b> <b>his</b> co-workers, [...] "with four exceptions", leaving {{it up to the}} {{audience}} to make educated guesses about whom these four exceptions are. The four are most likely Jim Halpert, Ryan Howard, Meredith Palmer and Toby Flenderson, due to Michael's hatred of him. However, it is also probable that Phyllis Lapin-Vance {{could be one of the}} exceptions, as, on many occasions, she and Dwight are shown to have a strained relationship. Kelly Kapoor is likewise a viable choice as her ditsy nature contrasts Dwight's overly serious character, as we see later in the same episode during Dwight's interrogation of Kelly. This theory is also reinforced by Angela's hatred of Kelly and the influence Angela may hold as Dwight's girlfriend at the time. Pam Halpert is also a possible exception as she is often an accomplice to Jim's pranks against Dwight.|$|E
2500|$|Orlando Brown portrayed Edward [...] "Eddie" [...] Thomas, Aged 14–17. He is Raven's male best friend. He is an {{aspiring}} rapper, {{and is a}} guard on the school basketball team. He is like a [...] "big brother" [...] to Cory Baxter and was commonly portrayed as playful, ambitious, loyal, girl crazy and quick to jump to conclusions. Occasionally, he says [...] "Told ya! Told ya twice!" [...] after he tells Raven not {{to do something that}} they both knew she would do. Another common catchphrase of his is [...] "Holla!" [...] after he finishes talking to his friends or girls that he <b>likes.</b> <b>His</b> parents are divorced, which is mentioned several times throughout the series. It is also said that he has a little brother. In one episode, Eddie and Raven not only start to develop romantic feelings for each other but they also kiss on the lips at two separate times; however, {{by the end of the}} episode, they decide to remain friends (though its strongly implied they're still interested in one another). Eddie has appeared in every episode except Juicer Consequences.|$|E
2500|$|Francis (Christopher Masterson): Hal and Lois' first son. At the {{beginning}} of the series, he is attending military school in Alabama, run by the strict Commandant Spangler (Daniel von Bargen). It is shown that his parents enjoyed a promising middle-class, comfortable lifestyle before he was born and that he was such a difficult, destructive child that that dream soon ended. He has himself legally emancipated at the start of Season 3, leaves the school, and travels to Alaska. He finds work at a logging camp and later meets and marries Piama (Emy Coligado), a girl of Inuit heritage. When the camp closes, they move to the western United States and take jobs at a Wild West-themed hotel/ranch, run by kindly but eccentric German, Otto Mannkusser (Kenneth Mars), and his wife, Gretchen (Meagen Fay). Francis and his mother have a mutual love-hate war of wills and his main motivation in life is to thwart or irk her (though, ironically, he marries a woman with the same personality as Lois.) Although a juvenile delinquent, he is street-smart. Francis becomes a less frequently seen character after season 5, becoming an occasional recurring character and making only a small handful of appearances in Season 6 and the final Season 7. Whereas he was featured regularly in previous seasons as a side-story to the main family, Francis' steady job disappeared in season 6 due to legal issues, and he returned to being a delinquent, leading a questionable and poor lifestyle with his wife, Piama, until it is revealed in the final episode of season 7, [...] "Graduation", that Francis already has a steady desk job sorting out computers. He admits he <b>likes</b> <b>his</b> job to Hal, but also enjoys frustrating Lois by telling her that he's unemployed. Also in the series finale, Francis and Piama are expecting their first child.|$|E
