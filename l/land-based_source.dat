This thesis considers sea-based (first part) and land-based (second part) anthropogenic and natural influences {{and attempts to}} analyse the effects on two different ecosystems the demersal and pelagic, by means of two different “biological indicators”. Has also been considered the impacts of traditional fishing practices {{on the quality of}} the bluefin tuna, destined to human consumption. The First Part considers the impact of fishing on demersal resources (Chapters 1 and 2) in increasing fishing effort areas and the influence of natural dynamics on shaping deep-sea assemblages in a submarine canyon (Chapter 3). Classical biodiversity indexes, statistical simulation and multivariate analysis ordination techniques were used in order to carry out the investigations. The main aim was to propose a new method able to provide information about environmental stress due to fishery, and to analyse the diversity of canyon assemblages related to depth and time. The second part considers the patterns of tuna catch variability to test the influence of a <b>land-based</b> <b>source</b> of anthropic perturbation, via time series analysis, BACI design and DFA (Chapter 4). Moreover is analysed the impact that the traditional tuna fishery may have on the final quality of the product (Chapter 5), by means of tuna’s body temperature measurements...|$|E

Numerous {{studies have indicated that}} deficiencies in these fatty acids can increase the risk or severity of cardiovascular, inflammatory and other diseases or disorders. EPA and DHA are predominantly sourced from marine fish although the primary producers are microalgae. Much work has been done to engineer a sustainable <b>land-based</b> <b>source</b> of EPA and DHA to reduce pressure on fish stocks in meeting future demand, with previous studies describing the production of fish oil-like levels of DHA in the model plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana. Principal Findings: In this study we describe the production of fish oil-like levels (. 12 %) of DHA in the oilseed crop species Camelina sativa achieving a high v 3 /v 6 ratio. The construct previously transformed in Arabidopsis as well as two modified construct versions designed to increase DHA production were used. DHA was found to be stable to at least the T 5 generation and the EPA and DHA were found to be predominantly at the sn- 1, 3 positions of triacylglycerols. Transgenic and parental lines did not have different germination or seedling establishment rates. Conclusions: DHA can be produced at fish oil-like levels in industrially-relevant oilseed crop species using multi-gene construct designs which are stable over multiple generations.

To {{increase the number of}} sustainable dietary options, a <b>land-based</b> <b>source</b> of n- 3 fatty acids that is effective in increasing tissue concentrations of the long-chain n- 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is required. The objective {{of the study was to}} examine the ability of dietary stearidonic acid (SDA) to increase tissue concentrations of EPA and DHA in healthy human subjects and to compare the effectiveness of SDA with that of the n- 3 fatty acids alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and EPA. Encapsulated SDA, ALA, or EPA was ingested daily in doses of 0. 75 g and then 1. 5 g for periods of 3 wk each by healthy male and postmenopausal female subjects (n = 15 /group) in a double-blind, parallel-group design. Dietary SDA increased EPA and docosapentaenoic acid concentrations but not DHA concentrations in erythrocyte and in plasma phospholipids. The relative effectiveness of the tested dietary fatty acids in increasing tissue EPA was 1 : 0. 3 : 0. 07 for EPA:SDA:ALA. Vegetable oils containing SDA could be a dietary source of n- 3 fatty acids that would be more effective in increasing tissue EPA concentrations than are current ALA-containing vegetable oils. The use of SDA-containing oils in food manufacture could provide a wide range of dietary alternatives for increasing tissue EPA concentrations.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{protection of}} marine and freshwater areas and ecosystems, including specially protected areas, is {{highly dependent on}} the effectiveness of an integrated approach to prevent and combat land-based pollution. Several legal regimes have been developed to regulate and solve this kind of pollution on the international level {{as well as on the}} European level. Therefore, this integrated approach requires coherence between European and international legal regimes and between the regulation of freshwater and the seas. An effective legal regime should provide clear goals and clear responsibilities and take into account the relevant impacts and pressures and the transboundary elements of the action against pollution of the sea from <b>land-based</b> <b>source</b> areas, and therefore respond to the need for cooperation between states and the need for an integrated approach to regulate all impacts and pressures that could influence the goals and targets for the specific protected areas. Integrated programmes of measures are necessary and so are arrangements for cooperation and dispute settlement. The protection of the Mediterranean Sea is taken as an example of the integrated ecosystem approach to protect marine regions. The article focuses on pollution caused by land-based sources. The combined rights and obligations under EU law and international law – in particular the Barcelona Convention – are discussed, as well as the required integrated approach towards the marine environment.

Sediment, a {{principal}} <b>land-based</b> <b>source</b> pollutant, can negatively affect coral reef ecosystems and impact {{the services they}} provide to society, such as recreation and fishing. Watershed managers interested in evaluating options and trade-offs require decision support tools that predict sediment export and retention. However, sediment load has previously been difficult to model in Hawaii because 1) observed annual sediment load data is not widely available and 2) Hawaii’s volcanic hydrology {{makes it difficult to}} use models designed on the continent. One method to estimate annual sediment loads is by measuring deposition rates in reservoirs. As of 2013, Hawaii had 140 regulated water storage reservoirs that perform as retention basins, yet the extent of their functionality had not been analyzed. I conducted a state-wide survey of reservoir capacity. Results demonstrated that only 15 % of the total water storage capacity of Hawaii’s reservoirs is currently used, and 40 % of all reservoirs are affected by sedimentation, representing a significant maintenance cost and potential risk. I also investigated spatial patterns of a broader array of ecosystem services including sediment retention, nitrogen retention, water yield, carbon sequestration, and agricultural production in West Maui. Between 1778 and 1920, I determined that sediment export increased by 18 times, while nitrogen export increased by 11 times over the same period. I demonstrated that past impacts from agriculture were more severe than predicted future development and climate change. Lastly, to calculate the first state-wide estimates of annual sediment export, I used a RUSLE-based model coupled with an estimate of the sediment delivery ratio (SDR), and adapted input datasets, including the erodibility and cover factors. To calibrate the model, I analyzed 60 watersheds with observed data for annual sediment load. I calculated that only 42 % of the total land area contributes to sediment export, and that Hawaii and Maui export 57 % of the total sediment load. Annual specific sediment yields ranged from 26 to 273 tons km- 2 yr- 1 across all islands, with Kahoolawe and Maui having the highest rates. These projects combined provide a base for watershed managers to identify management strategies to mitigate sediment export within an ecosystem context...|$|E

40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important techniques for ocean monitoring. Azimuth ambiguities are a real problem in SAR images today, which can cause performance degradation in SAR ocean applications. In particular, littoral zones can be strongly affected by <b>land-based</b> <b>sources,</b> whereas they are usually regions of interest (ROI). Given the presence of complexity and diversity in littoral zones, azimuth ambiguities removal is a tough problem. As SAR sensors can have a repeat cycle, multi-temporal SAR images provide new insight into this problem. A method for azimuth ambiguities removal in littoral zones based on multi-temporal SAR images is proposed in this paper. The proposed processing chain includes co-registration, local correlation, binarization, masking, and restoration steps. It is designed to remove azimuth ambiguities caused by fixed <b>land-based</b> <b>sources.</b> The idea underlying the proposed method is that sea surface is dynamic, whereas azimuth ambiguities caused by <b>land-based</b> <b>sources</b> are constant. Thus, the temporal consistence of azimuth ambiguities is higher than sea clutter. It opens up the possibilities to use multi-temporal SAR data to remove azimuth ambiguities. The design of the method and the experimental procedure are based on images from the Sentinel data hub of Europe Space Agency (ESA). Both Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) and Stripmap (SM) mode images are taken into account to validate the proposed method. This paper also presents two RGB composition methods for better azimuth ambiguities visualization.
