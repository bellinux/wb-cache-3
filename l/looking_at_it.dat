5|$|Mark's father {{remarried}} {{and raised}} them strictly, seeking to influence {{them to become}} leaders. Throughout his childhood and teenage years, Mark's father would have him combine athletic and mental training. Mark would have to dribble a basketball without <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> while reciting multiplication tables; practice baseball swings in a batting cage while answering questions about the periodic table and similar combined drills that his father hoped would develop quick thinking and self-confidence that would guide Mark {{in all areas of}} life and not simply sports.|$|E
5|$|On an {{examining}} table, {{one of the}} kidnappers, Eric Swan (James Marsters), strips Taylor, harshly washes {{her with}} a course brush, and photographs her. The picture is sent to Watts, who is seen <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> while supervising the crime scene. Black is also at the scene, and experiences a vision of Operation Desert Storm. Evidence is found of military-style tyre and boot tracks; these lead the FBI to an address where they find the second kidnapper murdered—Black and Watts clash over whether the Group or Swan are responsible. Back in the examination room, Swan exposes Taylor to a substance contained in a canister.|$|E
5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment. In {{order for the}} disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long focus lens is needed (at least 200mm for a 35mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.|$|E

5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But {{what do we need}} to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightness}} of the Sun can cause pain from <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes. Looking directly at the Sun causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness. UV exposure gradually yellows {{the lens of the}} eye over a period of years, and is thought to contribute to the formation of cataracts, but this depends on general exposure to solar UV, and not whether one looks directly at the Sun. Long-duration viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye can begin to cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused; conditions are worsened by young eyes or new lens implants (which admit more UV than aging natural eyes), Sun angles near the zenith, and observing locations at high altitude.|$|E
60|$|He {{cocked his}} head, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{with his right}} eye. Then he hopped round to the other side, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with his left eye. With either optic it seemed equally desirable.|$|R

5|$|The poem is in {{many ways}} deeply Christian, with {{frequent}} references to the fall of Adam and Eve and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated the depth of the Christian elements within the poem by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{in the context of the}} age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem and what does not. For example, some critics compare Sir Gawain to the other three poems of the Gawain manuscript. Each has a heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret Gawain similarly. Comparing it to the poem Cleanness (also known as Purity), for example, they see it as a story of the apocalyptic fall of a civilisation, in Gawain's case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like Noah, separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God's representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain's experience and wear garters themselves. In Cleanness the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.|$|E

25|$|Another way of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> is to {{consider}} the regression line to be a weighted average of the lines passing through the combination of any two points in the dataset.

25|$|An {{example of}} {{geometric}} algebra would be solving the linear equation ax = bc. The ancient Greeks would solve this equation by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> as an equality of areas {{rather than as}} an equality between the ratios a:b and c:x. The Greeks would construct a rectangle with sides of length b and c, then extend a side of the rectangle to length a, and finally they would complete the extended rectangle so as to find the side of the rectangle that is the solution.|$|E

25|$|But in 1951 I {{found myself}} in serious difficulty.

25|$|The {{ultimate}} aim {{for those}} 11 years during which I {{have been the}} Reichsfuehrer SS has been invariably the same: to create an order of good blood which is able to serve Germany; which unfailingly and without sparing itself can be made use of because the greatest losses can do no harm to the vitality of this order, the vitality of these men, because they will always be replaced; to create an order which will spread the idea of Nordic blood so far that we will attract all Nordic blood in the world, take away the blood from our adversaries, absorb it so that never again, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{from the viewpoint of}} grand policy, Nordic blood, in great quantities and to an extent worth mentioning, will fight against us.|$|E
25|$|Thinking {{and feeling}} are the {{decision-making}} (judging) functions. The thinking and feeling functions are both {{used to make}} rational decisions, based on the data received from their information-gathering functions (sensing or intuition). Those who prefer thinking tend to decide things from a more detached standpoint, measuring the decision by what seems reasonable, logical, causal, consistent, and matching a given set of rules. Those who prefer feeling tend to come to decisions by associating or empathizing with the situation, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> 'from the inside' and weighing the situation to achieve, on balance, the greatest harmony, consensus and fit, considering {{the needs of the}} people involved. Thinkers usually have trouble interacting with people who are inconsistent or illogical, and tend to give very direct feedback to others. They are concerned with the truth and view it as more important.|$|E

25|$|In {{variations}} of two-handed play, no cards are initially dealt, a distinction {{from all other}} variations. Instead, the entire deck is placed face-down on the playing surface between the two players to form the widow. One player begins the hand-building process by drawing the top card of the widow. The player can either keep that card for her or his hand or reject the card. If the player chooses to hold the initial card, the player then draws a second card from the widow, then places it face-down, without <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> creating a discard pile. If the player rejects the first card, the card becomes the first card in the discard pile. The second card drawn from the widow must be kept, regardless of whether she or he preferred the first card. Players alternate turns in this hand-building process until all cards are chosen.|$|E
