5|$|The Industrial Revolution {{changed much}} of Europe’s silk industry. Due to {{innovations}} on spinning cotton, cotton became much cheaper to manufacture and therefore caused more expensive silk production to become less mainstream. New weaving technologies, however, increased {{the efficiency of}} production. Among these was the Jacquard loom, developed for silk embroidery. An epidemic of several silkworm diseases caused production to fall, especially in France, where the industry never recovered. In the 20th century Japan and China regained their earlier role in silk production, and China is now once again the world’s largest producer of silk. The rise of new fabrics such as nylon reduced the prevalence of silk throughout the world, and silk is now once again a rare <b>luxury</b> <b>good,</b> much less important than in its heyday.|$|E
5|$|Tudor's {{plan was}} to export ice as a <b>luxury</b> <b>good</b> to wealthy members of West Indies and the {{southern}} US states, where he hoped they would relish the product during their sweltering summers; conscious of the risk that others might follow suit, Tudor hoped to acquire local monopoly rights in his new markets {{in order to maintain}} high prices and profits. He started by attempting to establish a monopoly on the potential ice trade in the Caribbean and invested in a brigantine ship to transport ice bought from farmers around Boston. At the time, Tudor was regarded by the business community at best as something of an eccentric, and at worst a fool.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{diplomatic}} venture of Zhang Qian into Central Asia {{during the reign}} of Emperor Wu of Han (r.141–87BC), the Han Empire of China sent a delegation to Mithridates II's court in 121BC. The Han embassy opened official trade relations with Parthia via the Silk Road yet did not achieve a desired military alliance against the confederation of the Xiongnu. The Parthian Empire was enriched by taxing the Eurasian caravan trade in silk, the most highly priced <b>luxury</b> <b>good</b> imported by the Romans. Pearls were also a highly valued import from China, while the Chinese purchased Parthian spices, perfumes, and fruits. Exotic animals were also given as gifts from the Arsacid to Han courts; in 87 AD Pacorus II of Parthia sent lions and Persian gazelles to Emperor Zhang of Han (r.75–88AD). Besides silk, Parthian goods purchased by Roman merchants included iron from India, spices, and fine leather. Caravans traveling through the Parthian Empire brought West Asian and sometimes Roman luxury glasswares to China. The merchants of Sogdia, speaking an Eastern Iranian language, served as the primary middlemen of this vital silk trade between Parthia and Han China.|$|E

40|$|<b>Luxury</b> <b>goods</b> and {{services}} have a niche market {{of their own}} that is placed {{at the top of}} the heap of society. This phenomenon has existed since historical times and is there in this age of globalization and technical innovation, coupled with growth in information and communication technology. The creation of a niche market for <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> is based upon strong aspirations of the consumers to attain certain levels in the society and get psychological and aesthetic satisfaction along with the expectation of getting high quality goods. This is true for existing and emerging markets for <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> including India. The analysis of literature and corresponding focused interviews related to this topic and its area of study i. e. India and its consumers of <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> vindicate the theories about consumer perception of <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> and the development of a corresponding market in India.

5|$|As silk was a <b>luxury</b> <b>good,</b> {{the market}} was small and easily {{saturated}} by machine produced goods. The next innovation in machine produced textiles came in the cotton industry which had a much wider market and produced more affordable goods. Spinning cotton was a more complex process than silk production. The water frame for spinning cotton was developed by Richard Arkwright and patented in 1769. The machines could spin yarn continuously and replaced skilled workers with unskilled supervisors {{to make sure the}} machines didn't break. Water frames varied in size from 4 to 96spindles. For these reasons, the water frame became popular and widespread. In 1771, Richard Arkwright took a lease on land in Cromford. By 1774, his first mill was operational, and in 1776 he began construction of a second mill at Cromford. During this time, he developed machines for pre-spinning and in 1775 took out his second patent. With spinning mechanised, the other processes involved in producing cotton could not keep up and also required mechanisation. He produced a machine for carding, the process which laid out the cotton fibres parallel, however not all his inventions were successful and cleaning the cotton was performed by hand until the 1790s when an effective machine was invented.|$|E

5000|$|Chinese <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> {{consumers}} are younger than their European counterparts, {{belonging to the}} 18-50 age group, compared to Europe's consumers who are generally in the over 40 age group. For this reason, China's <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> market {{is expected to grow}} faster than that of Europe's. Many of the young <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> buyers are self-employed or professionals. According to the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, 80% of Chinese <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> buyers are under 45, compared with 30% of <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> buyers in the United States and 19% in Japan.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{operational}} performance of <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> companies during the financial crisis of 2008 and the following recession. In addition, the study aims to provide insights on the relatively unstudied industry of <b>luxury</b> <b>goods.</b> The operational performance of <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> companies is further evaluated by comparing their key financial performance indicators against a benchmark group consisting of premium goods companies in order to find whether the <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> companies show outperformance during the recession. A regression analysis is conducted to gain further insight on the factors that potentially affect the results. The sample consists of a hand-collected data set of 20 publicly traded global <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> companies and a peer group of 20 public premium goods companies also operating globally. For the purposes of this study, the <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> industry is limited to the so- called personal <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> or <b>luxury</b> consumer <b>goods.</b> The financial data is gathered from Thomson One Banker and the companies financial statements, covering a time period from year-end 2007 to year-end 2010, covering the full economic down cycle: slowdown, recession and rebound. The main findings of this study support the set hypotheses regarding <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> companies' performance during the financial crisis and the following economic downturn. While <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> companies were not found to be immune to the recession, their performance was on aggregate positive despite the hostile operating environment. In addition, the positive performance was significantly better when compared to the peer group, which suggests that <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> companies indeed outperform their premium peers. Finally, the variables contributing to this performance were measured with sales growth, financial flexibility and initial profitability and were controlled for size. The findings of the multivariate analysis suggest that initial profitability and size are negatively associated with the performance while other variables suggest a positive association with the outperformance...|$|R

25|$|The Roman Empire knew of {{and traded}} in silk, and Chinese silk {{was the most}} highly priced <b>luxury</b> <b>good</b> {{imported}} by them. During the reign of emperor Tiberius, sumptuary laws were passed that forbade men from wearing silk garments, but these proved ineffectual. The Historia Augusta mentions that the 3rd Century AD emperor Elagabalus was the first Roman to wear garments of pure silk, whereas it had been customary to wear fabrics of silk/cotton or silk/linen blends. Despite the popularity of silk, the secret of silk-making only reached Europe around AD 550, via the Byzantine Empire. Legend has it that monks working for the emperor Justinian I smuggled silkworm eggs to Constantinople in hollow canes from China. All top-quality looms and weavers were located inside the Great Palace complex in Constantinople, and the cloth produced was used in imperial robes or in diplomacy, as gifts to foreign dignitaries. The remainder was sold at very high prices.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the latent determinants of the purchasing intention for fashion <b>luxury</b> <b>goods.</b> Design/methodology/approach: A total of 40 in-depth interviews were conducted with Italian customers in a fashion <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> store in Italy. Qualitative research was employed in data collection using the laddering technique and the means-end chain (MEC) analysis. Findings: Results showed that consumers buy <b>luxury</b> fashion <b>goods</b> mainly to match their lifestyle, thus satisfying their inner drives. The hierarchical value map resulting from the data collection and elaboration demonstrates that self-confidence and self-fulfillment are the main hidden final values when buying and consuming <b>luxury</b> <b>goods.</b> Implications for marketers are related to tailoring products, brand values and communication messages to the subjective, self-rewarding and "internalized" consumption sought after by consumers. Originality/value: The contribution of the paper is based on the use of the laddering technique and the means-end chain (MEC) analysis for investigating latent determinants of purchase intention for fashion <b>luxury</b> <b>goods.</b> Moreover, the paper examines this topic in the Italian market, which represents a relevant instance of mature market for fashion <b>luxury</b> <b>goods.</b> © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{approaches}} {{international trade}} in <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> from demand side. It associates demand for <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> with within-country income disparities, via a social interactions component, the so-called Veblen effect (Veblen 1899). In the theoretical part, we propose a simple model of vertical differentiation with preferences displaying a Veblen effect. The model predicts that demand for <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> increases with the income {{gap between the two}} socio-economic groups (wealthy and non-wealthy agents). Furthermore, wealthy individuals in societies with higher income disparities have higher incentives to purchase <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> and hence they are willing to pay more for these. Next, we provide an empirical validation of these predictions on a sample of French high-end exporters (as defined by Martin and Mayneris, 2013) from French 8 -digit CN custom data for 2006 at firm-product-destination level. Both demand for and average firm-product unit values of <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> are increasing with the income gap in importer country.
