Our findings indicate that management can best enable the emergence of positive deviance by combining empowering leadership behaviors with adequate levels of contingent reward and monitoring behaviors. These findings suggest that, depending on the frame of reference, positive deviance may emerge as a source for innovation that is endogenous to routines, rather than deviance from routines. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTear {{exchange}} {{beneath a}} contact lens facilitates ongoing fluid replenishment between the ocular {{surface and the}} lens. This exchange is considerably lower during the wear of soft lenses compared with rigid lenses. As a result, the accumulation of tear film debris and metabolic by-products between the cornea and a soft contact lens increases, potentially leading to complications. Lens design innovations have been proposed, but no substantial improvement in soft lens tear exchange has been reported. Researchers have determined post-lens tear exchange using several methods, notably fluorophotometry. However, due to technological limitations, <b>little</b> <b>remains</b> <b>known</b> about tear hydrodynamics around the lens and, to-date, true tear exchange with contact lenses has not been shown.

In this paper, a pilot experiment is presented investigating the effects of gender congruency on the perception of emotion from upper body movements. Male and female actors were enrolled to conduct a number of gestures within six general categories of emotion. These motions were mapped onto virtual characters with male and female embodiments. According to the gender congruency condition, the motions of male actors were mapped onto male characters (congruent) or onto female characters (incongruent) and vice-versa. A significant effect of gender mapping was found in the ratings of perception of three emotions (anger, fear and happiness), suggesting that gender may be an important aspect to be considered in the perception, and hence generation, of some emotional behaviours. © 2014 Springer International Publishing...|$|E

40|$|SummaryMicroRNAs are {{critical}} post-transcriptional regulators of hematopoietic cell-fate decisions, though <b>little</b> <b>remains</b> <b>known</b> about {{their role in}} aging hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We found that the microRNA- 212 / 132 cluster (Mirc 19) is enriched in HSCs and is upregulated during aging. Both overexpression and deletion of microRNAs in this cluster leads to inappropriate hematopoiesis with age. Enforced expression of miR- 132 in the bone marrow of mice led to rapid HSC cycling and depletion. A genetic deletion of Mirc 19 in mice resulted in HSCs that had altered cycling, function, and survival in response to growth factor starvation. We found that miR- 132 exerted its effect on aging HSCs by targeting the transcription factor FOXO 3, a known aging associated gene. Our data demonstrate that Mirc 19 {{plays a role in}} maintaining balanced hematopoietic output by buffering FOXO 3 expression. We have thus identified it as a potential target that might play a role in age-related hematopoietic defects...|$|E

HgSe CQDs are also an interesting platform to observe vanishing confinement in colloidal nanoparticles.
