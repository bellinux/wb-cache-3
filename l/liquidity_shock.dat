50|$|As the {{mortgage}} {{situation in the}} United States became more serious, market became unwilling to purchase ABCP. This caused trouble for financial institutions that had relied on sales of ABCP to obtain funds for use in longer-term investments (see Maturity mismatch). For example, as one form of the ABCP program, the structured investment vehicles (SIVs) set up by some commercial banks financed their longer-term, higher-yield investing through sales of ABCP. This had been very profitable when ABCP was considered safe (so that ABCP buyers accepted a low interest rate). When some asset prices dropped, investors were less willing to buy or rollover ABCP. This forced SIVs to quickly liquidate their longer-term investments at a substantial loss. The losses together with the panic in liquidity market formed a <b>liquidity</b> <b>shock</b> to the banking sector, which helped the contagion of the crisis.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{branch of}} {{contagion}} is a financial crisis, {{which is also}} referred to irrational phenomena. A financial crisis as a branch of contagion is formed when [...] "a co-movement occurs, even {{when there are no}} global shocks and interdependence and fundamentals are not factors." [...] It is caused by any of the four agents' behaviors who influence financial globalization. Some examples that can cause contagion are increased risk aversion, lack of confidence, and financial fears. Under the correlated information channel, price changes in one market are perceived as having implications for the values of assets in other markets, causing their prices to change as well (King and Wadhwani (1990)). Also, Calvo (1999) argues for correlated <b>liquidity</b> <b>shock</b> channel meaning that when some market participants need to liquidate and withdraw some of their assets to obtain cash, perhaps after experiencing an unexpected loss in another country and need to restore capital adequacy ratios. This behavior will effectively transmit the shock.|$|E

After calibrating the model, I find that a large and persistent negative <b>liquidity</b> <b>shock</b> can generate large drops in investment, employment and output. Contrary to the hypothesis, however, a negative <b>liquidity</b> <b>shock</b> generates an equity price boom. This counterfactual response of equity price is robust, provided that a negative <b>liquidity</b> <b>shock</b> tightens firms ’ financing constraint on investment. Also, I demonstrate that the same counterfactual response of equity price arises {{when there is a}} financial shock to a firm’s collateral constraint on borrowing. For equity price to fall as it typically does in a recession, the negative liquidity/financial shock must be accompanied or caused by other changes that relax firms ’ financing constraint on investment...|$|E

Our derivation of <b>liquidity</b> <b>shocks</b> allows for frequent shifts in velocity as they are derived as structural shocks from VARs in growth rates. Residential property price developments and money growth shocks accumulated over the boom periods are able to well explain the depth of post-boom recessions. We further suggest that <b>liquidity</b> <b>shocks</b> are a driving factor for real estate prices during boom episodes. During normal times however, the relative predictive power of <b>liquidity</b> <b>shocks</b> seems to shift from asset price inflation to consumer price inflation.

Furthermore, the documented effect is stronger for small stocks, stocks with low analyst coverage and institutional holdings, and for less liquid stocks.

In the unconstrained region, the economy behaves according to the dynamics of the standard real business cycle model. Below the frontier, <b>liquidity</b> <b>shocks</b> have the effects of investment shocks. In this region, investment is under-efficient and there is a wedge between the price of equity and the real cost of capital.

40|$|Hedge Fund Strategies We {{examine whether}} the {{increase}} in the flow of capital to hedge funds over the period 1994 - 2005 had a negative impact on performance. More specifically, we study the relative performance of small versus large funds for each of the hedge fund strategies. Our results indicate that on an absolute return basis, small funds outperform large funds. On a risk-adjusted return basis, however, we find that large funds outperform small funds, and that large funds are also shown to hold less liquid assets and take on less systematic and idiosyncratic risk than small funds. Finally, funds that experience positive <b>liquidity</b> <b>shocks</b> generally outperform those that experience negative <b>liquidity</b> <b>shocks.</b> Except for fixed-income funds, hedge fund managers that are aggressive in dealing with <b>liquidity</b> <b>shocks</b> perform better than hedge fund managers that are conservative in dealing with <b>liquidity</b> <b>shocks.</b> JEL Classification: G 29...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses liquidity and {{aggregate liquidity}} shocks in over-the-counter (OTC) markets. The topic {{was inspired by}} the pioneering work of Duffie, Gârleanu, and Pedersen (2005, 2007), who initiated a new strand of literature about asset pricing in OTC markets. This thesis completes the aggregate <b>liquidity</b> <b>shock</b> model of Duffie, Gârleanu, and Pedersen (2007), since {{it turned out to be}} imperfect. The thesis starts with an introduction into the basic search and bargaining model by Duffie et al. (2005) for asset pricing in an illiquid OTC market. Illiquidity is modeled with search frictions, which imply that trade does not happen instantly. Upon finding a trading partner, asset prices are directly bargained between those agents. This model forms the basis for the aggregate <b>liquidity</b> <b>shock</b> model by Duffie et al. (2007). Aggregate liquidity shocks are associated with a sudden shift in agents’ preferences towards asset holding, affecting a large fraction of investors simultaneously. Several investors experience a sudden decrease in their liquidity, leading to a forced withdrawal of assets: The market is hit by a selling pressure. This thesis presents an analytical solution method for the aggregate <b>liquidity</b> <b>shock</b> model of Duffie et al. (2007) and derives a semi-analytical solution for asset prices. Additionally, it shows how to complete the aggregate <b>liquidity</b> <b>shock</b> model of Duffie et al. (2007), since it turned out to be imperfect...|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} the credit default swap (CDS), {{corporate}} bond, and equity markets, we construct several measures of liquidity and examine the spill-over of <b>liquidity</b> <b>shocks</b> across these markets.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal appreciation path of an under-valued currency {{in the presence}} of speculative capital inflows that are endogenously affected by the appreciation path. A central bank decides the optimal appreciation path based on three factors: (i) Misalignment costs associated with the gap between the actual exchange rate and the fundamental exchange rate, (ii) short-term adjustment costs due to fast appreciation, and (iii) capital losses due to speculative capital inflows. We examine two cases in which speculators do and do not face <b>liquidity</b> <b>shocks.</b> We show that, in the case without <b>liquidity</b> <b>shocks,</b> the central bank should appreciate quickly to discourage speculative capital, and should appreciate more quickly in initial periods than in later periods.

40|$|Equity {{price is}} {{cyclical}} and often leads {{the business cycle}} by one or two quarters. These observations lead to the hypothesis that shocks to equity market liquidity are an independent source of the business cycle. In this paper I construct a model to evaluate this hypothesis. The model is easy for aggregation and {{for the construction of}} the recursive competitive equilibrium. After calibrating the model to the US data, I find that a negative <b>liquidity</b> <b>shock</b> in the equity market can generate large drops in investment and output but, contrary to what one may conjecture, the shock generates an equity price boom. This response of equity price occurs as long as a negative <b>liquidity</b> <b>shock</b> tightens firms' financing constraints on investment. Thus, liquidity shocks to the equity market cannot be the primary driving force of the business cycle. For equity price to fall as it typically does in a recession, a negative <b>liquidity</b> <b>shock</b> must be accompanied or caused by other shocks that reduce the need for investment sufficiently and relax firms' financing constraints on investment. I illustrate that a strong negative productivity shock is a good candidate of such concurrent shocks. Liquidity; Asset prices; Business cycle...|$|E
