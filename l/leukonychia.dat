50|$|White lines {{across the}} nail (<b>leukonychia</b> striata, or {{transverse}} <b>leukonychia)</b> may be Mees' lines or Muehrcke's lines.|$|E
50|$|This {{condition}} is whitening {{of parts of}} the nail plate in form of small white dots. There are several types of this condition. There are three different variations of partial leukonychia; punctate, transverse and longitudinal <b>leukonychia.</b> Some more serious variations of <b>leukonychia</b> partialis may lead to <b>Leukonychia</b> totalis.|$|E
50|$|Mees' {{lines or}} Aldrich-Mees' lines, also called <b>leukonychia</b> striata, are white lines of {{discoloration}} across the nails {{of the fingers}} and toes (<b>leukonychia).</b>|$|E
50|$|Small white patches {{are known}} as <b>leukonychia</b> punctata.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Leukonychia</b> striata, {{transverse}} <b>leukonychia,</b> or Mees' {{lines are}} a whitening or discoloration of the nail in bands or [...] "stria" [...] that run parallel the lunula (nail base). This is commonly caused by physical injury or {{disruption of the}} nail matrix. Common examples include excessive tapping of the nails, slamming a car door or extensive use of manicure. It may also occur in great toenails {{as a result of}} trauma from footwear. Alternatively, the condition can be caused by heavy metal poisoning most commonly by lead. It can also be caused by cirrhosis or chemotherapy.The tendency toward <b>leukonychia</b> striata is sometimes inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. In other cases, it can be attributed to vigorous manicuring and trauma aforementioned, or {{to a wide variety of}} systemic illnesses. Serious infections known for high fevers, measles, malaria, herpes, and leprosy may also cause this condition. In many patients, there is no obvious cause, and the streaks resolve spontaneously.There is a similar condition called Muehrcke's lines (apparent <b>leukonychia)</b> which differs from <b>leukonychia</b> in that the lines fade with digital compression and does not migrate with the growth of the nail.|$|E
50|$|It is {{harmless}} {{and most}} commonly caused by minor injuries, such as nail biting, that occur while the nail is growing. <b>Leukonychia</b> occurs most commonly in healthy individuals, unrelated to any known nutritional or physiological deficiency. When caused by injury the marks will disappear as the nail grows outwards, however a dietary deficiency will cause recurrent <b>leukonychia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Apparent <b>leukonychia</b> is a {{cutaneous}} condition {{characterized by}} white discoloration of the nail that fades with pressure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{appearance}} of white {{spots on the}} fingernails (<b>Leukonychia)</b> is due to lying/not eating enough green vegetables/calcium.|$|E

50|$|Longitudinal <b>leukonychia</b> is {{far less}} common and {{features}} smaller 1mm white longitudinal lines visible under the nail plate. It {{may be associated with}} Darier's disease.|$|E
5000|$|Patients with {{hepatocellular}} dysfunction {{may develop}} hair-thinning or hair loss and nail {{changes such as}} clubbing, <b>leukonychia</b> (whitening), or onycholysis, affecting the nails of the hands and feet.|$|E
50|$|Muehrcke's nails, Muehrcke's lines, or <b>leukonychia</b> striata are {{changes in}} the {{fingernail}} {{that may be a}} sign of an underlying medical disorder or condition. Muehrcke's lines are white lines (<b>leukonychia)</b> that extend {{all the way across the}} nail and lie parallel to the lunula (half moon). In contrast to Beau's lines, they are not grooved. The lines are actually in the vascular nail bed underneath the nail plate, and as such, they do not move with nail growth. Meuhrcke's lines disappear when pressure is placed over the nail, blanching the underlying nail bed.|$|E
5000|$|Bart-Pumphrey {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} [...] "Palmoplantar keratoderma with knuckle pads and <b>leukonychia</b> and deafness") is a cutaneous condition characterized by hyperkeratoses (knuckle pads) over the metacarpophalangeal, proximal and distal interphalangeal joints.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "true" [...] <b>leukonychia,</b> {{this is the}} most common form of <b>leukonychia,</b> in which small white spots appear on the nails. Picking and biting of the nails are a {{prominent}} cause in young children and nail biters. Besides parakeratosis, air that is trapped between the cells may also cause this appearance. It is also caused by trauma. In most cases, when white spots appear on a single or a couple of fingers or toes, the most common cause is injury to the base (matrix) of the nail. When this is the case, white spots disappear after around eight months, which is the amount of time necessary for nails to regrow completely. The pattern and number of spots may change as the nail grows.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leukonychia</b> (or leuconychia), {{also known}} as white nails or milk spots, is a medical term for white {{discolouration}} appearing on nails. It {{is derived from the}} Greek words leuko ("white") and nychia ("nails"). The most common cause is injury {{to the base of the}} nail (the matrix) where the nail is formed.|$|E
50|$|The classic {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} in children are loss of appetite, abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss, constipation, anemia, kidney failure, irritability, lethargy, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems. Slow development of normal childhood behaviors, such as talking and use of words, and permanent intellectual disability are both commonly seen. Although less common, {{it is possible for}} fingernails to develop <b>leukonychia</b> striata if exposed to abnormally high lead concentrations.|$|E
5000|$|Half {{and half}} nails (also known as [...] "Lindsay's nails") show the {{proximal}} {{portion of the}} nail white and the distal half red, pink, or brown, with a sharp line of demarcation between the two halves. Seventy percent of hemodialysis patients and 56% of renal transplant patients {{have at least one}} type of nail abnormality. Absence of lunula, splinter hemorrhage, and half and half nails were significantly more common in hemodialysis patients, while <b>leukonychia</b> was significantly more common in transplant patients.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{of arsenic}} {{poisoning}} begin with headaches, confusion, severe diarrhea, and drowsiness. As the poisoning develops, convulsions {{and changes in}} fingernail pigmentation called <b>leukonychia</b> striata (Mees's lines, or Aldrich-Mees's lines) may occur. When the poisoning becomes acute, symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting, vomiting blood, blood in the urine, cramping muscles, hair loss, stomach pain, and more convulsions. The organs {{of the body that}} are usually affected by arsenic poisoning are the lungs, skin, kidneys, and liver. The final result of arsenic poisoning is coma and death.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Leukonychia</b> is {{the white}} {{discoloration}} of the nail plate. There are many subtypes of <b>leukonychia.</b> True <b>leukonychia,</b> which occurs due to pathology in the matrix; pseudoleukonychia, {{is caused by the}} changes of nail bed. True <b>leukonychia</b> is subdivided as total and partial <b>leukonychia.</b> Total <b>leukonychia</b> may be genetic or associated with systemic diseases. Partial <b>leukonychia</b> is usu-ally caused by trauma. Partial <b>leukonychia</b> can be classified as punctate, transverse and longitudi-nal. Three different types of pseudoleukonychia can be distinguished; half and half nails, Terry’s nails and Muehrcke’s nails...|$|E
40|$|Total <b>leukonychia</b> {{is a rare}} nail {{disorder}} that may be inherited or associated with systemic disease or idiopathic where the aetiology cannot be established. Herein, we report idiopathic total <b>leukonychia</b> in two young healthy men, presenting with <b>leukonychia</b> of fingernails since childhood. The cause for <b>leukonychia</b> could not be established in both of them as there was negative family and drug history {{and there was no}} evidence of systemic disease...|$|E
40|$|Hereditary <b>leukonychia</b> {{is a rare}} genetic nail {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} distinctive whitening of the nail plate of all 20 nails. Hereditary <b>leukonychia</b> may exist as an isolated feature, or in simultaneous occurrence with other cutaneous or systemic pathologies. Associations between hereditary <b>leukonychia</b> and mutations in the gene encoding phospholipase C delta- 1 (PLCδ 1) have previously been identified. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PLCδ 1 mutations and hereditary <b>leukonychia</b> remain uncharacterized. In the present study, we introduced hereditary leukonychia-linked human PLCδ 1 mutations (C 209 R, A 574 T and S 740 R) into equivalent residues of rat PLCδ 1 (C 188 R, A 553 T and S 719 R), and investigated their effect on the biophysical and biochemical properties of the PLCδ 1 protein. Our data suggest that these PLCδ 1 mutations associated with hereditary <b>leukonychia</b> do not uniformly alter the enzymatic ability of this protein leading to loss/gain of function, but result in significantly divergent enzymatic properties. We demonstrate {{here for the first}} time the importance of PLC-mediated calcium (Ca 2 +) signalling within the manifestation of hereditary <b>leukonychia.</b> PLCδ 1 is almost ubiquitous in mammalian cells, which may explain why hereditary <b>leukonychia</b> manifests in association with other systemic pathologies relating to keratin expression...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} rare {{case of a}} 34 -year-old patient with persistent, progressive, {{acquired}} <b>leukonychia</b> totalis and partialis. Idiopathic acquired <b>leukonychia</b> is a rare chromatic disorder of the nail not associated with other abnormalities and discernible etiology. Our case report did not link the inheritance of <b>leukonychia</b> with diverse clinical syndromes. To our knowledge, only five cases of idiopathic, acquired, true total <b>leukonychia</b> were found in literature. This case was the sixth patient with asymptomatic idiopathic, white fingernails, and toenails without a hereditary cause. Copyright © 2009 M. R. Bongiorno and M. Aricò.

40|$|<b>Leukonychia</b> {{refers to}} a white {{discoloration}} of the nails. Although several conditions may cause white nails, a rare, isolated, congenital form of the disease is hypothesized to stem from disordered keratinization of the nail plate.

40|$|Congenital <b>leukonychia</b> {{is a rare}} nail {{disorder}} that may occur in isolation or in association {{with a number of}} syndromic disorders. In the following letter, we describe a case of isolated congenital true <b>leukonychia</b> to add to the current literature. This case is particularly unique in that it {{does not appear to be}} inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, in contrast to the majority of reported cases...|$|E
40|$|Acquired {{bilateral}} longitudinal true <b>leukonychia</b> {{is a rare}} disorder. We {{present a}} case of a 35 -year-old healthy woman presented with this unusual and rare manifestation. She mentioned a history of unprotected exposure to detergents and bleaching chemical agents. Considering her low zinc level, she was prescribed with zinc capsules and recommended to avoid chemical substances for 6 months. During bimonthly follow-up, her zinc level turned normal, and <b>leukonychia</b> subsequently disappeared. Bilateral longitudinal true <b>leukonychia</b> in the nails due to zinc deficiency and exposure to chemical substances has not been reported previously. Direct and indirect effects of chemical substances on matrix and the effect of zinc deficiency on healing process should be considered in these cases...|$|E
40|$|Hereditary <b>leukonychia</b> (porcelain nails {{or white}} nails) {{is a rare}} nail {{disorder}} with an unknown genetic basis. To identify variants in a gene underlying this phenotype, we identified four families of Pakistani origin showing features of hereditary <b>leukonychia.</b> All 20 nails of each affected individual were chalky and white in appearance, consistent with total <b>leukonychia,</b> with no other cutaneous, appendageal, or systemic findings. By using Affymetrix 10 K chip, we established linkage to chromosome 3 p 21. 3 -p 22 with a LOD score (Z) of 5. 1. We identified pathogenic mutations in PLCD 1 in all four families, which encodes phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C delta 1 subunit, a key enzyme in phosphoinositide metabolism. We then identified localization of PLCD 1 in the nail matrix. It was recently shown that PLCD 1 is {{a component of the}} human nail plate by proteomic analysis and is localized in the matrix of human nails. Furthermore, mutations detected in PLCD 1 resulted in reduced enzymatic activity in vitro. Our data show that mutations in PLCD 1 underlie hereditary <b>leukonychia,</b> revealing a gene involved in molecular control of nail growth...|$|E
40|$|Unilateral <b>leukonychia</b> {{and hair}} {{depigmentation}} in {{multifocal motor neuropathy}} Neurophysiology studies in a 50 -year-old man with slowly progressive weakness of the left upper limb revealed conduction block in the ulnar nerve above the elbow.

MRI {{of the brain and}} cervical spine was normal. Multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block is a rare autoimmune motor neuropathy typically pre-senting with asymmetric distal upper limb weakness without sensory loss. 1 Unilateral nail changes have been described in the context of posttraumatic reflex sympathetic dystrophy. 2 The hair depigmentation is unexplained...|$|E
40|$|Bart-Pumphrey {{syndrome}} (BPS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder {{characterized by}} hearing loss, <b>leukonychia,</b> knuckle pads and palmoplantar keratoderma. Two mutations in the extracellular domain of GBJ 2 are resposible for this syndrome. To date, less than 10 case reports or clinical series about BPS {{have been published}} in the literature. Hearing loss and knuckle pads are the more commonly seen findings of this syndrome. Three generations and six family members with variable findings of knuckle pads, <b>leukonychia,</b> hearing loss and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis were presented in this report.

40|$|A 24 -year old female {{patient with}} acute lymphoblastic leukemia {{was treated with}} the {{induction}} therapy of the GIMEMA ALL protocol based on vincristine, daunoru-bicin, asparaginase and prednisone. In the second month of therapy, she {{was found to have}} white bands on all her fingernails. There were two bands on each fingernail (Figure), but her toenails were not affected. It was observed that the transverse white nail bands moved dis-tally in time and disappeared after cessation of chemotherapy, and that longitudinal nail growth was not affected. The patient hadn’t a history of trauma of the nails. This transient disorder of nail matrix is called true <b>leukonychia</b> whereas the pathology of nail bed and fold is known as apparent <b>leukonychia.</b> 1 The white nail bands also known as Mees ’ lines 2 were first described by Mees in 1919 as associated finding of arsenic intoxication. 3 In patients receiving cancer chemotherapy transverse <b>leukonychia</b> is a side-effect of treatment rather than a consequence of the underlying cancer. The chemothera-peutic agents that most frequently lead to white nail bands are doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5 -fluorouracil. 1, 4 - 6 Nail changes as a result of chemotherapy are usually transitory and disap-pear with therapy cessation and the nail growth...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Literature {{concerning}} {{clinical signs}} {{and frequency of}} nail psoriasis is incomplete. Recent studies focus only on signs included in the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI). OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe clinical characteristics of fingernail psoriasis in comparison with healthy controls. METHODS: We collected data on 49 patients with fingernail psoriasis who visited our outpatient department and 49 control subjects, through questionnaires and clinical examination. The disease severity {{was measured by the}} NAPSI. RESULTS: Mean NAPSI score in patients and control subjects was 26. 6 and 3. 6, respectively. Most items included in the NAPSI were specific for nail psoriasis. Onycholysis and splinter hemorrhages were most frequently observed. <b>Leukonychia</b> was more frequent in control subjects. Longitudinal ridges and Beau lines are not included in the NAPSI but are significantly more frequently seen in patients than in control subjects. LIMITATIONS: Limited sample size was a limitation. CONCLUSION: The NAPSI was able to discriminate patients with fingernail psoriasis from healthy control subjects. Onycholysis and splinter hemorrhages were the most prevalent fingernail changes in psoriatic patients. <b>Leukonychia</b> was more frequently observed in control subjects, which {{raises the question of whether}} <b>leukonychia</b> should remain in the NAPSI. On the other hand, longitudinal ridges and Beau lines occurred more frequently in psoriasis but are not included in the NAPSI...|$|E

40|$|Mucocutaneous manifestations {{are common}} among {{patients}} on hemodialysis (HD). This study was undertaken {{to determine the}} prevalence of mucocutaneous manifestations in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are on HD. In this cross-sectional, descriptive and analytic study conducted in 2009, 100 patients on HD at the Five Azar Hospital in Gorgan city were randomly selected. All the patients underwent detailed examination by a dermatologist to look for lesions in the skin, hair, nail and mucous membranes; if felt necessary, biopsy {{was obtained from the}} lesions. The findings were statistically analyzed using SPSS- 13 software. For evaluation of normality of distribution, Kolmogorov-Smirnov was used, for quantitative variables Mann-Whitney and T-test (abnormal distribution) were used and for qualitative variables, Chi- 2 and Fisher were used. In this study, P-value less than 0. 05 was considered significant. Fifty-one males and 49 females were enrolled. The mean age was 49 ± 12 years. Diabetes was {{the most common cause of}} ESRD. In 95 % of the patients, at least one mucocutaneous manifestation was present. Xerosis (78. 3 %) was the most common lesion, followed by pruritus (39. 1 %), lentigo (34. 8 %), skin discoloration (32. 6 %), <b>leukonychia</b> (32 %) and thinning of the nail bed (24 %). Xerosis, scaling, lentigo, folliculitis, idiopathic guttate hypopigmentation, <b>leukonychia</b> and half and half nail were associated with age. A significant relationship was seen between duration on dialysis and skin discoloration and <b>leukonychia.</b> Clubbing had a significant association with calcium-phosphorus product (Ca × P). There was a significant association between serum ferritin level and pruritus and tinea versicolor lesions. Our study shows that mucocutaneous manifestations are common among patients with ESRD. Identification of these manifestations and their association with causative factors are useful for preventing the lesions...|$|E
