2500|$|In 1987, Kramer was the {{catalyst}} {{in the founding}} of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), a direct action protest organization that chose government agencies and corporations as targets to publicize lack of treatment and funding for people with AIDS. ACT UP was formed at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Services Center in New York City. Kramer was asked to speak as part of a rotating speaker series, and his well-attended speech focused on action to fight AIDS. He began by having two-thirds of the room stand up, and told them they would be dead in five years. Kramer reiterated the points introduced in his essay [...] "1,112 and Counting": [...] "If my speech tonight doesn't scare the shit out of you, we're in real trouble. If what you're hearing doesn't rouse you to anger, fury, rage, and action, gay men will have no future here on earth. How <b>long</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> take before you get angry and fight back?" [...] Their first target became the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which Kramer accused in The New York Times of neglecting badly needed medication for HIV-infected Americans.|$|E
2500|$|The Hakeem Nicks Laugh/Loser Game Show Sound - Jokes {{are a major}} fixture of {{the show}} and one-liner jokes occur quite often. [...] For example, during one episode Stugotz made the {{accusation}} that [...] "Gone with the Wind" [...] was overrated and decried {{the length of the}} movie. [...] He punctuated this grievance with the joke [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> take for something to blow away?". [...] When such a joke is made, it will invoke one of two sounds, either the Loser Game Show Sound (The Tuba Riff from The Price is Right, played following a contestant losing) or the Hakeem Nicks Laugh. [...] The Hakeem Nicks Laugh was sound taken during an interview that Dan said was an otherwise useless endeavor as Nicks hadn't been saying anything interesting, and Dan insists the subtle [...] "heh heh heh" [...] of The Hakeem Nicks Laugh was the only thing of value found in the interview. [...] If a joke is deemed generally bad, corny, or falls in the category of a [...] "dad joke", or if Mike Ryan feels like irritating Dan, the joke will get the Loser Game Show Sound. [...] If it is deemed to be clever enough, or if there is a certain aspect of sexual innuendo, it will garner the Hakeem Nicks Laugh.|$|E

60|$|The {{theory of}} books is noble. The scholar {{of the first}} age {{received}} into him the world around; brooded thereon; gave it the new arrangement of his own mind, and uttered it again.

It was dead fact; now, it is quick thought. It can stand, and it can go.

60|$|On Monday night, the Twentieth of June 1791, about eleven o'clock, {{there is}} many a hackney-coach, and glass-coach (carrosse de remise), still rumbling, or at rest, {{on the streets}} of Paris. But of all Glass-coaches, we {{recommend}} this to thee, O Reader, which stands drawn up, in the Rue de l'Echelle, hard by the Carrousel and outgate of the Tuileries; in the Rue de l'Echelle that then was; 'opposite Ronsin the saddler's door,' as if waiting for a fare there! Not <b>long</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> wait: a hooded Dame, with two hooded Children has issued from Villequier's door, where no sentry walks, into the Tuileries Court-of-Princes; into the Carrousel; into the Rue de l'Echelle; where the Glass-coachman readily admits them; and again waits. Not long; another Dame, likewise hooded or shrouded, leaning on a servant, issues in the same manner, by the Glass-coachman, cheerfully admitted. Whither go, so many Dames? 'Tis His Majesty's Couchee, Majesty just gone to bed, and all the Palace-world is retiring home. But the Glass-coachman still waits; his fare seemingly incomplete.|$|E

6000|$|Early {{the next}} morning I walked into a fish-house near our hotel, where three or four men were engaged in trundling out the pickled fish on barrows, and {{spreading}} them to dry. They told me that a vessel had lately {{come in from the}} Banks with forty-four thousand codfish. Timothy Dwight says that, just before he arrived at Provincetown, [...] "a schooner come in from the Great Bank with fifty-six thousand fish, almost one thousand five hundred quintals, taken in a single voyage; the main deck being, on her return, eight inches under water in calm weather." [...] The cod in this fish-house, just out of the pickle, lay packed several feet deep, and three or four men stood on them in cowhide boots, pitching them on to the barrows with an instrument which had a single iron point. One young man, who chewed tobacco, spat on the fish repeatedly. Well, sir, thought I, when that older man sees you he will speak to you. But presently I saw the older man do the same thing. It reminded me of the figs of Smyrna. [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> take to cure these fish? I asked.|$|E
6000|$|The huts now gave {{place to}} houses very tall and spacious and very dark. But for the narrowness {{of the streets}} we might have {{stumbled}} upon Chowringhi in the dark. An {{hour and a half}} has passed, and up to this time we have not crossed our trail once. [...] "You might knock about the city for a night and never cross the same line. Recollect Calcutta isn't one of your poky up-country cities of a lakh and a half of people." [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> take to know it then?" [...] "About a lifetime, and even then some of the streets puzzle you." [...] "How much has the head of a ward to know?" [...] "Every house in his ward if he can, who owns it, what sort of character the inhabitants are, who are their friends, who go out and in, who loaf about the place at night, {{and so on and so}} on." [...] "And he knows all this by night as well as by day?" [...] "Of course. Why shouldn't he?" [...] "No reason in the world. Only it's pitchy black just now, and I'd like to see where this alley is going to end." [...] "Round the corner beyond that dead wall. There's a lamp there. Then you'll be able to see." [...] A shadow flits out of a gulley and disappears. [...] "Who's that?" [...] "Sergeant of Police just to see where we're going in case of accidents." [...] Another shadow staggers into the darkness. [...] "Who's that?" [...] "Soldier from the Fort or a sailor from the ships. I couldn't quite see." [...] The Police open a shut door in a high wall, and stumble unceremoniously among a gang of women cooking their food. The floor is of beaten earth, the steps that lead into the upper stories are unspeakably grimy, and the heat is the heat of April. The women rise hastily, and the light of the bull's eye--for the Police have now lighted a lantern in regular London fashion--shows six bleared faces--one a half-native half-Chinese one, and the others Bengali. [...] "There are no men here!" [...] they cry. [...] "The house is empty." [...] Then they grin and jabber and chew pan and spit, and hurry up the steps into the darkness. A range of three big rooms has been knocked into one here, and there is some sort of arrangement of mats. But an average country-bred is more sumptuously accommodated in an Englishman's stable. A horse would snort at the accommodation.|$|E
6000|$|Now, I {{will give}} you a sort of general {{synopsis}} of my idea--of course, everything is subject to your own revision and change. The article, we will say, is written by a TYPICAL train hoister--one without your education and powers of expression (bouquet) but intelligent enough to convey his ideas from HIS STANDPOINT--not from John Wanamaker's. Yet, in order to please John, we will have to assume a virtue that we do not possess. Comment on the moral side of the proposition as little as possible. Do not claim that holding up trains is the only business a gentleman would engage in, and, on the contrary, do not depreciate a profession that is really only financiering with spurs on. Describe the FACTS and DETAILS--all that part of the proceedings that the passenger sitting with his hands up in a Pullman looking into the end of a tunnel in the hands of one of the performers does not see. Here is a rough draft of my idea: Begin abruptly, without any philosophizing, with your idea of the best times, places and conditions for the hold-up--compare your opinions of this with those of others--mention some poorly conceived attempts and failures of others, giving your opinion why--as far as possible refer to actual occurrences, and incidents--describe the manner of a hold-up, how many men is best, where they are stationed, how do they generally go into it, nervous? or joking? or solemnly. The details of stopping the train, the duties of each man of the gang--the behavior of the train crew and passengers (here give as many brief odd and humorous incidents as you can think of). Your opinions on going through the passengers, when is it done and when not done. How is the boodle gotten at? How does the express clerk generally take it? Anything done with the mail car? UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WILL A TRAIN ROBBER SHOOT A PASSENGER OR A TRAIN MAN--suppose a man refuses to throw up his hands? Queer articles found on passengers (a chance here for some imaginative work)--queer and laughable incidents of any kind. Refer whenever apropos to actual hold-ups and facts concerning them of interest. What could two or three brave and determined passengers do if they were to try? Why don't they try? How <b>long</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> take to do the business. Does the train man ever stand in with the hold-up? Best means of getting away--how and when is the money divided. How is it mostly spent. Best way to manoeuvre afterward. How to get caught and how not to. Comment on the methods of officials who try to capture. (Here's your chance to get even.) ...|$|E
6000|$|The Austrians, {{on their}} side, were equally stagnant; and, except the continual skirmishing with the Prussian foragers, {{undertook}} nothing.
