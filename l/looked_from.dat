25|$|On July 4, 1938, Mantz {{flew from}} Wichita to Burbank, California, {{accompanied}} by Paramount press agent, pilot, and pulp writer, Edward Churchill, {{in an attempt}} to break the speed-dash record. The stunt was part of the promotion for the film Men With Wings. The flight ran into several difficulties. The motor overheated over the Grand Canyon. When they reached Burbank, the landing gear jammed and it took 30 minutes to work it loose, while thousands of spectators <b>looked</b> <b>from</b> the ground and the fuel ran perilously low. Churchill was stricken with carbon monoxide poisoning and had to be treated by a physician after landing.|$|E
25|$|Despite its {{understated}} reputation A' Bhuidheanach Bheag {{does offer}} the walker {{the feeling of}} space and the wide open skies of the high Grampian mountains. Its gentle curving slopes have much wildlife with Eurasian dotterel, ptarmigan, grouse and mountain hare seen on a regular basis. The hill's name translates from the Gaelic language as “Little Yellow Place” and is thought {{to refer to the}} coarse yellow grass which grows on its slopes. The “Little” part of the name is slightly confusing as the hill is the highest point on {{the southern part of the}} plateau but demonstrates that the hill was named from how it <b>looked</b> <b>from</b> the valley not by its altitude.|$|E

I'm dying!' She was coaxed to lie down again, but {{remained}} agitated. [...] "The child turned to me, and said anxiously, 'Send a telegram to mama.'" [...] Eagar promised it would be done. [...] "She added, 'immediately.' ... We continued to fan the feeble spark of life, but moment by moment it declined. She began to talk to her cousins, and seemed to imagine she was playing with them. She asked for little Anastasie and I brought the wee thing into the room. The dying eyes rested on her for a moment, and Anastasie said, 'Poor cousin Ella! Poor Princess Elizabeth!' I took the baby out of the room." [...] Doctors told Alexandra that the child's mother should be notified, but the telegram did not arrive until the following morning, when Elisabeth had already died. An autopsy following her death confirmed that she had died of virulent typhoid, although it was rumored she had eaten from a poisoned dish intended for the Tsar.|$|E
40|$|Two axioms {{of order}} geoemtry are the poset axioms of transitivity and antisymmetry of the {{relation}} "is in front of" when <b>looking</b> <b>from</b> a point. From these axioms, by <b>looking</b> <b>from</b> an interval instead of a point, further well-known axioms of order geometry are generated in the following sense: Transitivity when <b>looking</b> <b>from</b> an interval is equivalent to Assioma XIII of paragraph 10 in G. Peano, I principii di geometria logacimente exposti. Assuming this axiom, antisymmetry when <b>looking</b> <b>from</b> an interval is equivalent VIII. Grundsatz in paragraph 1 in M. Pasch, Vorlesungen ueber neuere Geometrie. Further equivalences, {{with some of the}} implications well-known, are proved along the way. Comment: 11 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

2500|$|Film {{historian}} Jeffrey Vance {{said that}} Garbo communicated her characters' innermost feelings through her movement, gestures, and most importantly, her eyes. With the slightest movement of them, he argues, she subtly conveyed complex attitudes and feelings toward other characters {{and the truth}} of the situation. [...] "She doesn't act," [...] said Camille co-star Rex O’Malley; [...] "she lives her roles." [...] Director Clarence Brown, who made seven of Garbo's pictures, told an interviewer [...] "Garbo has something behind the eyes that you couldn't see until you photographed it in close-up. You could see thought. If she had to look at one person with jealousy, and another with love, she didn't have to change her expression. You could see it in her eyes as she <b>looked</b> <b>from</b> one to the other. And nobody else has {{been able to do that}} on screen." [...] Director George Sidney adds [...] "You could call it underplaying but in underplaying she overplayed everyone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{ship was}} {{launched}} on 17 December 1912 and was initially christened Polaris (eponymous with Polaris, the North Star). She was [...] long, with a [...] beam and measured 348 tons gross. Though her black hull <b>looked</b> <b>from</b> the outside {{like that of}} any other vessel of a comparable size, it was not. She was designed for polar conditions with a very sturdy construction. Her keel members were four pieces of solid oak, one above the other, adding up to a thickness of , while its sides were between [...] and [...] thick, with twice as many frames as normal and the frames being of double thickness. She was built of planks of oak and Norwegian fir up to [...] thick, sheathed in greenheart, a notably strong and heavy wood. The bow, which would meet the ice head-on, had been given special attention. Each timber had been made from a single oak tree chosen for its shape so that its natural shape followed the curve of the ship's design. When put together, these pieces had a thickness of [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} titled War for several reasons; in 1982, Bono said, [...] "War {{seemed to be}} the motif for 1982," [...] adding that [...] "Everywhere you <b>looked,</b> <b>from</b> the Falklands to the Middle East and South Africa, there was war. By calling the album War we're giving people {{a slap in the face}} and at the same time getting away from the cosy image a lot of people have of U2." [...] The Edge said that [...] "It's a heavy title. It's blunt. It's not {{something}} that's safe, so it could backfire. It's the sort of subject matter that people can really take a dislike to. But we wanted to take a more dangerous course, fly a bit closer to the wind, so I think the title is appropriate." [...] The boy on the cover is Peter Rowen (brother of Bono's friend, Guggi). He also appears on the covers of Boy, Three, The Best of 1980–1990, Early Demos and many singles. Bono described the reasoning behind the cover: [...] "Instead of putting tanks and guns on the cover, we've put a child's face. War can also be a mental thing, an emotional thing between loves. It doesn't have to be a physical thing." ...|$|E
