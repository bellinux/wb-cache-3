25|$|The {{exhibition}} {{closed in}} the late 1990s {{and almost all of}} the exhibits were taken away. The locomotive The Queen was too expensive to remove, so, rather than being cut up, it was incorporated as a feature of a restaurant on the concourse. It is still there today, but <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tired. The tender– the only original (and historic) part of the replica engine– was sold to a scrap dealer and cut up, although the springs and axleboxes were salvaged for use in the replica LB Atlantic project at the Bluebell Railway, and part of one side was rescued by the Slough and Windsor Railway Society, where it is now on display.|$|E
500|$|Wisden {{describes}} {{how in the}} first innings, Agnew's accuracy was affected by debutant nerves, but an improved display in the second innings resulted in figures of 2–51. Agnew {{describes how}} Ian Botham helped him secure both wickets, catching Gordon Greenidge in the slips, and passing on some {{advice on how to}} dismiss Viv Richards, Botham's great friend: [...] "Botham said: 'Right. Don't pitch a single ball up at him. Have two men back for the hook, and bowl short every ball.' This I did for three overs or so, by which time Viv was <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> exasperated, but was definitely on the back foot. Finally I pitched one up, the great man missed it and umpire David Constant ruled that Richards was LBW for 15." [...] Wisden called the pair of batsmen Agnew's [...] "first illustrious victims in Test cricket".|$|E
500|$|Monica Herrera of Billboard said Usher's [...] "star {{power is}} clearly rubbing {{off on the}} 16-year-old", commenting that Bieber [...] "shows off his smoothest moves yet [...] " [...] and [...] "tackles his toughest choreography." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV News commented, [...] "While Bieber had {{previously}} teased his dancing skills in the [...] "Baby" [...] video, he really channeled Usher's smooth moves in this newest clip." [...] Tamar Antai also of MTV said, [...] "Usher {{does most of the}} heavy lifting where dancing is concerned, and Justin Bieber, who's more of a singer than a dancer, is in no danger of upstaging Usher on the dance floor." [...] Antai compared Bieber's moves to Usher in his [...] "Caught Up" [...] video, commenting [...] "it's nice to see Justin expanding the scope of talents to include pelvic thrusts, Matrix-style slo-mo leans" [...] and, [...] "it's also nice to see Justin <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more mature and sophisticated in a hoodie and leather jacket....and his videos are growing up with him, as this is his flashiest, most grandiose video yet. Antai also commented on the appeal of the video, commending Meyers, [...] "who put that classic early '00s-style big-money polish on the piece – for employing fire, shirtless dudes, white ninjas..." ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 15, 2005, Stone {{drove his}} younger sister Vet Stone on his {{motorcycle}} to Los Angeles' Knitting Factory, where Vet was performing with her Sly & the Family Stone tribute band, the Phunk Phamily Affair. Stone kept his helmet on during the entire performance, and was described by one concertgoer as <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like Bootsy Collins. A film crew doing a documentary on Sly & the Family Stone, later released as , was at the show and captured this rare sighting on film. Stone, according to his web site, is producing and writing material for the group's new album. In addition, Stone renamed the group [...] "Family Stone." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{decided to}} change its name to Revocation in 2006; Davidson commented: [...] "I think, <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> deeper into it, we {{made a lot of}} {{mistakes}} with Cryptic Warning. We were younger and didn't really know what we were doing, so Revocation was us starting fresh with a clean slate and revoking our past mistakes." [...] With a direction change, Revocation promptly recorded a three-song demo titled Summon the Spawn, and in 2008 they went back into the studio to record their first full-length album, Empire of the Obscene. The full length was self-released, and the band financed its own tour, attracting the interest of several record labels. Revocation subsequently signed to Relapse Records.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Dancing on My Own" [...] was filmed {{in a studio}} in Stockholm, Sweden. It was {{directed}} by Max Vitali, who previously worked with Robyn on the second music video for her 2005 single [...] "Be Mine!" [...] Decida choreographed it and Nils Ljunggren served as the producer. Visually, Vitali wanted the video to be simple; it was made to resemble Robyn's live performances and her then-upcoming tour. In a behind-the-scenes video, Robyn said, [...] "It's going to be <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit like what I'm going to bring on tour. So it's a performance video but it's {{also going to be}} in I guess something like a rave or like a club or somewhere where people are dancing." [...] Robyn explained that the video is about being sad on the dance floor and the main focus is dancing.|$|E
