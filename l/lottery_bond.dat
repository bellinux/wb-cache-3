Both the equity premium puzzle and the credit spread puzzle {{address the problem of}} a reasonable size of agents’ risk aversion. The estimation of risk aversion is, however, impeded by the fact that observed prices depend on risk preferences and probability beliefs. The market for German redemption <b>lottery</b> <b>bonds</b> (Tilgungsanleihen) constitutes an exceptionally clean environment to study investors’ risk preferences independent of subjective probability beliefs as the probabilities of price changes caused by redemption lotteries are objectively known. The focus of this thesis is to analyze the systematic redemption risk of <b>lottery</b> <b>bonds.</b> Our contribution to the literature is twofold. On the theoretical side, we develop a fully specified dynamic equilibrium model to price redemption <b>lottery</b> <b>bonds.</b> On the empirical side, we employ the valuation model to estimate implied risk aversion coefficients from transaction prices of German <b>lottery</b> <b>bonds.</b> Our most important findings are threefold: estimated relative risk aversion coefficients are significantly positive, of moderate magnitude, and time dependent...|$|R

50|$|Although {{the details}} vary by bond and by issuer, the {{principle}} remains the same. A drawing takes place {{according to a}} schedule to decide which serial numbers are to be redeemed. The individual bonds within the issue thus identified by the drawing are then bought back by the issuer, so that {{the total value of}} an issue will decrease as time passes and more bonds are redeemed. A small number of bonds are redeemed for an amount greater than their face value. Hence the holder of that particular bond will have won the ‘lottery’. <b>Lottery</b> <b>bonds</b> are similar to prize-linked savings accounts.|$|R

40|$|I {{propose the}} {{establishment}} of a SETI <b>Lottery</b> <b>Bond</b> to provide a continued source of funding for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). The SETI <b>Lottery</b> <b>Bond</b> is a fixed rate perpetual bond with a lottery at maturity, where maturity occurs only upon discovery and confirmation of extraterrestrial intelligent life. Investors in the SETI <b>Lottery</b> <b>Bond</b> purchase shares that yield a fixed rate of interest that continues indefinitely until SETI succeeds [...] -at which point a random subset of shares will be awarded a prize from a lottery pool. SETI <b>Lottery</b> <b>Bond</b> shares also are transferable, so that investors can benefact their shares to kin or trade them in secondary markets. The total capital raised this way will provide a fund to be managed by a financial institution, with annual payments from this fund to support SETI research, pay investor interest, and contribute to the lottery fund. Such a plan could generate several to {{tens of millions of dollars}} for SETI research each year, which would help to revitalize and expand facilities such as the Allen Telescope Array. The SETI <b>Lottery</b> <b>Bond</b> is a savings product that only can be offered by a financial institution with authorization to engage in banking and gaming activities. I therefore suggest that one or more banks offer a lottery-linked savings product in support of SETI research, with the added benefit of promoting personal savings and intergenerational wealth building among individuals.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between investor risk preferences and asset returns. The paper provides direct evidence on the risk aversion of participants in a securities market. It uses the prices of <b>lottery</b> <b>bonds</b> issued by the Imperial Russian Government in 1864 and 1866 to estimate investor risk aversion and to study changes in preferences toward risk. Time variation in investor risk preferences is then compared to {{the dynamics of the}} Russian bond market over the period 1889 to 1904. Increases in risk aversion are positively associated with increases in the price of a risk-free asset. This result is in accord with economic intuition that higher risk aversion is associated with higher demand for a safe asset, and hence, higher equilibrium price of a risk-free security and a lower risk-free rate. Implications of a Consumption CAPM model for a relationship between changes in interest rates and changes of risk aversion are tested. Evidence supporting the model is found. The paper provides evidence on the role of risk aversion in securities market dynamics...|$|R
50|$|With {{the great}} {{conflicts}} {{that started with}} the Glorious Revolution of 1688 (financed with a bank loan that a consortium of Amsterdam bankers threw together in three days) these markets tightened appreciably, however. Holland was now forced to reintroduce the unprofitable lijfrenten, and to resort to gimmicks like <b>lottery</b> <b>bonds</b> to entice lenders to buy its bonds. As the supply of funds from redemptions and retained earnings now fell short of government demand, these new loans must have been partially financed by disinvestments in the commercial, industrial and agricultural {{sectors of the economy}} (admittedly depressed in these years). By 1713 Holland's debt had reached a total of 310 million guilders, and that of the Generality of the Republic of 68 million (illustrating the relative preponderance of Holland in the Republic's finances). The debt service of this debt amounted to 14 million guilders. This exceeded the ordinary tax revenues of Holland. Most of this debt was now concentrated in the hands of only a relatively few families, that not so coincidentally also had privileged access to political office.|$|R
40|$|Although of {{paramount}} importance in finance, empirical evidence on time-varying risk aversion remains mixed. This paper contributes to the existing literature by analyzing how investors’ risk preferences change under extreme circumstances. Using the market prices of a Belgian <b>lottery</b> <b>bond,</b> we build an index that tracks the attitude toward risk of financial markets’ participants during the Second World War. Results show that risk aversion dramatically changed during the Occupation period. Before 1943, investors showed strong signs of risk aversion; yet, in 1943 and 1944, they exhibited a risk-seeking attitude. After 1943, investors agreed to pay more and more for the lottery feature, and {{much more than the}} lottery’s expected payoff. In line with the behavioral finance literature, this puzzling result is attributed to psychological factors, most importantly the euphoria brought by the prospect of the war’s end. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contributes {{new evidence}} to two areas of research. The first two essays aim at analyzing persistence in {{growth rates of}} operating performance as an important factor for firm valuations. In this context, in-depth analyses on both the predictive power {{as well as the}} predictability of persistence in growth rates are performed. The two central research questions are: Do investors overestimate the predictive power of a high persistence in sales growth rates? Is it possible to predict a high future persistence in growth rates based on a set of firm-specific financial indicators? In the third essay, a very successful British <b>lottery</b> <b>bond</b> is in the focus of interest, the Premium Bond. Although monthly return is solely based on a lottery and therefore uncertain, this financial product is very popular. The study aims to explain what makes the Premium Bond and generally lottery-linked deposit accounts successful.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the results of a}} simple, easily replicable, survey study based on <b>lottery</b> <b>bonds.</b> It is aimed at testing whether agents make {{investment}} decisions according to expected utility, cumulative prospect theory (Tversky-Kahneman, 1992) or optimal expectations theory (Brunnermeier and Parker, 2005, Brunnermeier et al., 2007) when they face skewed distributions of returns. We show that more than 56 % of the 245 participants obey optimal expectations theory. They choose a distribution of payoffs which is dominated for second-order stochastic dominance and which would not be chosen according to cumulative prospect theory, for a large range of parameter values. Our results first cast doubt on the relevance of variance as a measure of risk; they show the importance of skewness in decision making and, more precisely, they emphasize the attractiveness of the best outcome, an essential feature of optimal expectations theory. The ranking of outcomes, used in cumulative prospect theory, seems insufficient to characterize the way people distort beliefs. As by-products of this study, we illustrate that agents use heuristics when they choose numbers at random and have, in general, a poor opinion about the rationality of others.

40|$|As their Millennium Development Goals, {{world leaders}} have pledged by 2015 to halve {{the number of}} people living in extreme poverty and hunger, to achieve {{universal}} primary education, to reduce child mortality, to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS, and to halve {{the number of people}} without safe drinking water. Achieving these goals requires a large increase in the flow of financial resources to developing countries - double the present development assistance from abroad. Examining innovative ways to secure these resources, this book sets out a framework for the economic analysis of different sources of funding, applying the tools of modern public economics to identify the key issues. It examines the role of new sources of overseas aid, considers the fiscal architecture and the lessons that can be learned from federal fiscal systems, asks how far increased transfers impose a burden on donors, and investigates how far one can separate raising resources from their use. In turn, the book examines global environmental taxes (such as a carbon tax) the taxation of currency transactions (the Tobin tax), a development-focused allocation of Special Drawing Rights by the IMF, the UK Government proposal for an International Finance Facility, increased private donations for development purposes, a global <b>lottery</b> (or premium <b>bond),</b> and increased remittances by emigrants. In each case, it considers the feasibility of the proposal and the resources that it can realistically raise.
