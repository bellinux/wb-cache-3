50|$|In {{analogue}} broadcasting the {{composite video signal}} modulates the carrier by a type of amplitude modulation named VSB. The polarity of the modulation is negative, i.e., higher {{the level of the}} CVS, lower the level of the RF signal. If the level of CVS is 0 volt the level of the RF signal is % 100. The modulation index is so arranged that, the maximum level of CVS yields a RF level of % 10 (sometimes % 12.5). This value is known as the level of the residual carrier. If the modulation index yields more than % 10 for maximum <b>level</b> <b>input</b> (high residual carrier), the efficiency of the transmission drops, i.e., low contrast. On the other hand, if the RF level is below % 10 (low residual carrier), aural and visual signals begin to interfere each other. So {{it is important to keep}} %10 for 1000 mV input.|$|E
50|$|The {{transponder}} receives coded {{or single}} pulse interrogation from ground stations and transmits a single-pulse reply {{in the same}} frequency band. A common antenna is used for receiving and transmitting. The transponder consists of five functional systems: superheterodyne receiver, decoder, modulator, transmitter, and power supply. The duplexer (a 4-port ferromagnetic circulator) provides isolation between receiver and transmitter. Interrogating pulses are directed from the antenna to the receiver, and reply pulses are directed from the transmitter to the antenna. The preselector, consisting of three coaxial cavities, attenuates all RF signals outside the receiving band. The received signal is heterodyned to a 50 MHz intermediate frequency in the mixer and amplified in the IF amplifier which also contains the detector. In case of coded transmission, the decoder module provides a pulse output only if the correct spacing exists between pulse pairs received. The shaped-pulse output of the decoder is directed to the modulator which converts it into a high-power, precisely shaped and precisely delayed pulse which {{is applied to the}} magnetron to produce the reply pulse. Six telemetry outputs are provided: input signal <b>level,</b> <b>input</b> pulse repetition frequency (PRF), temperature, incident power, reflected power, and reply PRF.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{eukaryotic}} cell cycle involves {{a variety of}} proteins and regulatory interactions, dynamical systems approach {{can be taken to}} simplify a complex biological circuit into a general framework for better analysis. Among the four possible input/output relationships, the relationship between Sic1 level and mitotic exit seems to show the characteristics of an irreversible bistable switch, driven by feedback between APC-Cdh1, Sic1, and Clb2-Cdk1. [...] Bistability is known to control biological functions such as cell cycle control and cellular differentiation and {{play a key role in}} many cellular regulatory networks. Bistable input/output relationship is characterized by two stable states with two bifurcation points. Multiple outputs are possible for one specific input in the region of bistability, marked by two bifurcation points. In addition, the bistable relationship displays hysteresis: the final state/output depends on the history of the input as well as the current value of input because the system has a memory. One bifurcation point has a negative control parameter value (the bifurcation point is on the other side of the axis), resulting in disconnection between the two stable states and irreversibility of the transition from one state to the other. With regard to mitotic exit, the two stable states are defined by mitosis and G1 phase. Once Sic1 <b>level</b> (<b>input)</b> accumulates beyond the threshold, irreversible transition occurs from mitosis (stable state I) to G1 phase (stable state II). In the imperfect environment, the only bifurcation that remains intact is saddle-node bifurcation. Saddle-node bifurcation does not break down (saddle-node is the expected generic behavior), while transcritical and pitchfork bifurcations break down in the presence of imperfections. Thus, the only one-dimensional bifurcation that can exist in imperfect biological world is the saddle-node bifurcation. The bistable relation between M-G1 transition and Sic1 level can be represented as a diagram of two saddle-node bifurcations in which the system’s behavior changes qualitatively with a small change in control parameter, the amount of Sic1.|$|E

This research deals with schemes to improve robust-ness through tolerancing input parameters in ranges of the distributions which make non-conformances more likely. The need for probabilistic analysis to investigate this problem is substantiated due to differences which arise when input parameters vary at different levels, for example the engine-to-engine and blade-to-blade level. Specifically, the importance of blade-to-blade <b>level</b> <b>input</b> parameters relative to engine-to-engine <b>level</b> <b>input</b> parameters becomes increasingly important for larger numbers of blades in a row.
