She had lied to law enforcement, photographers, producers, directors, co-workers, {{and the general public}} for two years. The owners of her movie agency and X-Citement Video, Inc. were arrested.

South and other industry officials said that Lords, who was seeking employment, provided a California driver's license, a U.S. passport, and a birth certificate, which stated that her name was Kristie Nussman and gave a birth date of November 17, 1962. Leslie Jay, spokeswoman for Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, also said Lords showed identification indicating that she was older than 18 before the illicit photos for the September 1984 issue were taken (she was actually fifteen years of age in the photographs). When investigators used Lords' fake birth certificate and fake state identification cards to [...] locate the real Kristie Nussman, Nussman said that her birth certificate had been stolen a few years earlier and that an impostor had apparently forged her name on official forms. Two adults who knew Lords, but who requested anonymity, said they saw her picture in the adult magazine Velvet during July 1984, and telephoned the district attorney's office to inform authorities that she was underage, but that an investigator told them, [...] "There isn't anything we can do about it." ...|$|E

Strohmeyer {{claimed he was}} high on alcohol and drugs {{at the time and}} did not remember committing the crimes. It was even suggested that perhaps the witness, David Cash, had, in fact, been the one to murder Sherrice, as Strohmeyer claimed to have no recollection of his actions and the witness was the one to actually tell him what he had seen him doing in the bathroom that night. Abramson also noted that Strohmeyer's biological father is in prison and his biological mother is in a mental hospital.|$|E

[...] "I thought it was time to do a lawyer, especially with the O.J. Simpson trial. It would have been passe to play an agent." [...] In season one, the character makes frequent references to said trial by using air quotes and referring to it as simply [...] "the trial." [...] Ullman used the character as a vehicle to take aim at attorneys becoming celebrities and America's new-found obsession with televised court proceedings. The character's personality was inspired by an agent Ullman used to have [...] "who was insane." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Men√©ndez {{brothers}} {{and the murder}} of their parents became a national sensation when Court TV broadcast the trial in 1993. The younger brother's defense attorney, <b>Leslie</b> <b>Abramson,</b> became famous with her flamboyant defense, alleging that the brothers were driven to murder by a lifetime of abuse {{at the hands of}} their parents, including sexual abuse at the hands of their father, who was described as a cruel, callous perfectionist and a pedophile and Kitty was portrayed as a selfish, mentally-unstable alcoholic and drug addict, who had enabled her husband's abuse and was also sometimes violent towards them. [...] However, the brothers' lack of a past criminal history contrasted the [...] "escape from parental abuse" [...] theory. The trial ended with two deadlocked juries. The voting jurors went along sex lines as the brothers' female lawyers went to considerable lengths to divide the jurors by sex, as men on the both juries voted for a conviction, while female jurors refused to accept their findings.|$|E
