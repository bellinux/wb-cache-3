The purpose of the present investigation was to study the biodiesel production from <b>lampante</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and crude olive pomace oil with acid values much higher than 1 %. In this study, two different processes for biodiesel production were tested and compared with these raw materials. One, by using the traditional alkaline catalyzed transesterification process, the other by a two step process using acid catalyzed esterification followed by alkaline catalyzed transesterification. The acid catalyzed esterification process was optimized by application the response surface methodology. The highest yields of fatty acid methyl esters were obtained by the two step process. The properties of the biodiesel obtained from both raw materials were determined and most of the parameters were in accordance to the specifications of biodiesel standard.

Also, <b>lampante</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> from the olive mill showed no detectable amounts, but olive oil from the market contained 6 - 30 mg kg(- 1). This contamination cannot be attributed to the refining step, which, on the contrary, partially removes the more volatile hydrocarbons, but could result from transport. Olive-pomace oils obtained by second centrifugation contained 16 - 14 mg kg(- 1) mineral paraffins, presumably because of contamination during storage Of the pomace.

40|$|An {{association}} between the intake of heterocyclic amines (HAs) {{and the development of}} cancer has been observed in some epidemiological studies, while in other studies no such correlation has been found. HAs are mutagenic/carcinogenic compounds formed at low levels via the Maillard reaction and a free radical mechanism during cooking of animal tissue. The addition of pure antioxidants or foods containing antioxidants has previously been shown to decrease the amount of HAs formed during cooking. In this study, beefburgers were fried in six different oils: refined <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> depleted of phenols, rapeseed <b>oil,</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> with rosemary extract and refined <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> with rosemary extract.

40|$|<b>Virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> {{the main}} fat of the Mediterranean diet, is per se {{considered}} as a functional food—as stated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) —due to its content in healthy compounds.

Thus, a good strategy to ensure an optimal intake of polyphenols through habitual diet would be to produce enriched <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> with well-known bioactive polyphenols. Different sources of natural biological active substances can be potentially used to enrich <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (e. g., raw materials derived from the same olive tree, mainly olive leaves and pomaces, and/or other compounds from plants and vegetables, mainly herbs and spices).
