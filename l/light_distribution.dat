40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{efficient}} global illumination computation in dynamic environments {{by taking advantage of}} temporal coherence of <b>lighting</b> <b>distribution.</b> The method is embedded in the framework of stochastic photon tracing and density estimation techniques. A locally operating energy-based error metric is used to prevent photon processing in the temporal domain for the scene regions in which <b>lighting</b> <b>distribution</b> changes rapidly. A perceptionbased error metric suitable for animation is used to keep noise inherent in stochastic methods below the sensitivity level of the human observer. As a result a perceptually-consistent quality across all animation frames is obtained. Furthermore, the computation cost is reduced compared to the traditional approaches operating solely in the spatial domain...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} {{of high quality}} animations which feature compelling lighting effects is computationally a very heavy task when traditional rendering approaches are used where each frame is computed separately. The {{fact that most of}} the computation must be restarted from scratch for each frame leads to unnecessary redundancy. Since temporal coherence is typically not exploited, temporal aliasing problems are also more difficult to address. Many small errors in <b>lighting</b> <b>distribution</b> cannot be perceived by human observers when they are coherent in temporal domain. However, when such a coherence is lost, the resulting animations suffer from unpleasant flickering effects. In this thesis, we propose global illumination and rendering algorithms, which are designed specifically to combat those problems. We achieve this goal by exploiting temporal coherence in the <b>lighting</b> <b>distribution</b> between the subsequent animation frames.

40|$|A {{new light}} concept called Adaptive Light Control (ALC) is {{developed}} {{with the aim}} to improve night time traffic safety. ALC improves the headlamp illumination by means of continuous adaptation of the headlamps according to the current driving situation and current environment. In order to ensure rapid prototyping and early testing the step from off-line to online (real-time) simulation of <b>light</b> <b>distributions</b> in the driving simulator has been successfully done. This real time simulation enabled the interactive development of new <b>light</b> <b>distributions</b> in different driving situations and driving environments.

40|$|Background. The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the illumination characteristics of LED lights objectively to ease the selection of surgical lighting. Methods. The illuminance distributions of 5 main and 4 auxiliary lights were measured in 8 clinically relevant scenarios. For each light and scenario, the maximum illuminance E-c (klux) and the size of the light field d(10) (mm) were computed. Results. The results showed: that large variations for both E-c (25 - 160 klux) and d(10) (109 - 300 mm) existed; that using auxiliary lights reduced both E-c and d(10) by up to 80 % and 30 %; that with segmented <b>lights,</b> uneven <b>light</b> <b>distributions</b> occurred; and that with colored LED lights shadow edges on the surgical field became colored. Conclusions. Objective illuminance measurements show a wide variation between lights and a superiority of main over auxiliary <b>lights.</b> Uneven <b>light</b> <b>distributions</b> and colored shadows indicate that LED lights still need to converge to an optimal desig...|$|R

40|$|This relighting {{approach}} [2] {{includes an}} illumination estimation technique (referred to as ”inverse rendering”) {{coupled with a}} simple method for relighting the original photograph. It requires a geometric model of the scene which is obtained with a laser range finder in the experiments. The technique is successfully applied by relighting {{an image of a}} watering can as well as a picture of a human head. The authors note in the introduction that it is often neccessary to make modifications to images. Typically this is performed with 2 D image editing software. Although great results can be achieved by a skilled artist, tasks such as changing the lighting of a scene are still very difficult and tedious. With information about the 3 D geometry of the scene, many new possibilities are opened. The goal of {{the first part of the}} method is to recover the <b>lighting</b> <b>distribution</b> given an image, the camera position, and model of the scene.

40|$|We analyse {{the global}} {{structure}} of the old stellar discs in 34 edge-on spiral galaxies. The radial and vertical exponential scale parameters of the discs are obtained by applying an improved two-dimensional decomposition technique to our I -band photometry.

The range and maximum of the intrinsic flattening of the disc light seem to increase with both maximum rotational velocity and total Hi mass. We use the disc flattening to estimate the disc contribution to the maximum rotational velocity, resulting in an average of 57 +/- 22 per cent.
