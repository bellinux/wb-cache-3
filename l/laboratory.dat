5|$|The wartime Manhattan Project left {{a legacy}} {{in the form}} of the network of {{national}} laboratories: the Lawrence Berkeley National <b>Laboratory,</b> Los Alamos National <b>Laboratory,</b> Oak Ridge National <b>Laboratory,</b> Argonne National <b>Laboratory</b> and Ames <b>Laboratory.</b> Two more were established by Groves soon after the war, the Brookhaven National <b>Laboratory</b> at Upton, New York, and the Sandia National Laboratories at Albuquerque, New Mexico. Groves allocated $72million to them for research activities in fiscal year 1946–1947. They would be in the vanguard of the kind of large-scale research that Alvin Weinberg, the director of the Oak Ridge National <b>Laboratory,</b> would call Big Science.|$|E
5|$|A British mission led by Akers {{assisted}} {{in the development of}} gaseous diffusion technology at the SAM Laboratories in New York. Another, headed by Mark Oliphant, assisted with that of the electromagnetic separation process at the Berkeley Radiation <b>Laboratory.</b> Cockcroft became the director of the joint British-Canadian Montreal <b>Laboratory.</b> A British mission to the Los Alamos <b>Laboratory</b> was led by Chadwick, and later Peierls, which included several of Britain's most eminent scientists. As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership, and ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the Physics Department worked on the development of optical munitions, particularly aluminised mirrors for aerial photography. In February 1942, Oliphant persuaded Laby to release Burhop and Leslie Martin to work on microwave radar at the Radiophysics <b>Laboratory</b> in Sydney. Burhop and Martin produced a <b>laboratory</b> model of a cavity magnetron on 23 July 1942. Their magnetron was based on an overseas design, but made entirely from local components so that it could be manufactured in Australia. In September 1942 he returned to the University of Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research <b>Laboratory,</b> an outpost of the Radiophysics <b>Laboratory,</b> where his task was turning his cavity magnetrons and reflex klystrons from prototypes into production models. Eventually, over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Chadwick {{followed}} Rutherford to the Cavendish <b>Laboratory</b> at the University of Cambridge, where Chadwick {{earned his}} Doctor of Philosophy degree under Rutherford's supervision from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in June 1921. He was Rutherford's {{assistant director of}} research at the Cavendish <b>Laboratory</b> for over a decade at a time when it was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like John Cockcroft, Norman Feather, and Mark Oliphant. Chadwick followed his discovery of the neutron by measuring its mass. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish <b>Laboratory</b> in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, where he overhauled an antiquated <b>laboratory</b> and, by installing a cyclotron, made it an important centre for the study of nuclear physics.|$|E

After the war, he became the head of J (Test) Division at Los Alamos, and was director or assistant director of numerous nuclear weapons tests during the 1940s and 1950s. Graves was badly injured in the 1946 <b>laboratory</b> criticality accident in Los Alamos that killed Louis Slotin, but recovered.|$|E

5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at a {{difficult}} time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor {{and there was}} a possibility that the <b>laboratory</b> would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the <b>laboratory.</b> He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from <b>laboratory</b> devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, University of Miami President Bowman Ashe {{recruited}} F.G. Walton Smith, a young British {{marine biologist}} {{who was working}} in the Bahamas. Smith joined the Department of Zoology, and began organizing the development of a marine <b>laboratory.</b> In 1943, the Board of Trustees of the University of Miami established the Marine <b>Laboratory</b> for the University. They invited researchers and oceanographers to associate themselves with this <b>laboratory.</b> Its three original objectives were teaching, basic research, and applied marine research. The <b>laboratory</b> focused on subjects specific to the tropical environment. Initially, the Marine Lab was located in a private boathouse on an estate on Belle Isle in Miami Beach, Florida. In 1945, when the boathouse became structurally unsafe, the lab moved to a converted apartment building in Coral Gables, Florida near the main campus.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Rabi {{became a}} member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research <b>Laboratory.</b> That month, the British Tizard Mission brought a number of new {{technologies}} to the United States, including a cavity magnetron, a high-powered device that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field. This device, which promised to revolutionize radar, demolished any thoughts the Americans had entertained about their technological leadership. Alfred Lee Loomis of the National Defense Research Committee decided to establish a new <b>laboratory</b> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop this radar technology. The name Radiation <b>Laboratory</b> was chosen as both unremarkable and a tribute to the Berkeley Radiation <b>Laboratory.</b> Loomis recruited Lee DuBridge to run it.|$|E
