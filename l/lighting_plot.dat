50|$|Lux Aeterna Theater has no {{stationary}} location and operates internationally; {{it can be}} easily assembled on various sites. The premises must include a projection surface (planetarium, dome hemisphere, panoramic projection screen, etc.), seats, and an optical pad behind the seats, projectors, and remote control. The optical pad is a metal plate with drilled holes in the grid and with threaded openings. The drives are positioning the optical elements into the beam or slow-acting control beam {{with a set of}} lines. Each line of the laser creates a separate image. The method, resulting in interference patterns on flat surfaces, is based on the use of accidental phase modulation, which occurs when a laser beam passing through optically heterogeneous mediums is refracted at different points and angles along its way, resulting in interference patterns projected on a screen that change in contour and texture with each change in medium. The medium is made of solid transparent matter (e.g. moving plates of non-uniform structure -usually round discs mounted in a revolving cassette. And as a result, a wide selection of visual character, image, shapes, effect appears on a screen. Or/and an additional lens is used to concentrate the light field. Or/and transfocators are mounted at the beam's point of exit. These form-building methods can be used in the same cassettes (to increase image possibilities) with diffraction gratings, curvilinear reflectors or a large moving lens (for the deformation of light imago). <b>Lighting</b> <b>plot</b> involves complex abstract light ductile movements. The projection tool allows receiving on-screen a very complex dynamics of light colorful shapes, to create a light accompaniment by colorful, graphic, structural visualization of thematic development, to unite music, musical sounds, and musical noises with light content. It also allows the spatial separation and motion of different audio content, voices, melody and musical instruments.|$|E

TITLE: LIGHTING THE THREE MUSKETEERS MAJOR PROFESSOR: Mark Varns 	The following document is a written summation {{of the process}} of researching, designing, installing, and evaluating the lighting design for The Three Musketeers by Ken Ludwig. The show was produced at Southern Illinois University in November 2013 and was performed upon the McLeod Stage. 	The first chapter will discuss the research process featuring the novel by Alexandre Dumas and the play as written by Ken Ludwig. Chapter 2 covers the design process and its various considerations while Chapter 3 expounds upon the installation of the lighting design. Chapter four is where I evaluate my successes and failures {{during the course of the}} preparation for and culmination of the lighting design. The appendices feature a scene by scene breakdown of the action of the play, a visual record of gobos used in the production, and a series of photographs that show scenes from the production as well as a series of images featuring specific aspects of the lighting design. Supplementary material is a pdf file of the final <b>lighting</b> <b>plot...</b>|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 73 - 74). This thesis {{serves as}} a document showing {{the evolution of the}} lighting design from first reading of the script to opening night for the San Diego State University Theatre Department's production of Peter Pan & Wendy in November 2012. This production of Peter Pan & Wendy was an adaptation by Margaret Larlham of the original J. M. Barrie script written in 1904. This adaptation featured a live rock band and original music composed specifically for the show to aid in the transitions and storytelling and make the action more entertaining for the target audience of children. The challenges of this production lie mostly in the process that the director, Margaret Larlham, used to develop the production. Professor Larlham enjoys developing her stage productions as ensemble pieces in which the actors and director discover thematic elements and characterizations as part of the rehearsal process. As a result of this discovery-based approach, the production is often not finished until the show's opening. Included in this thesis are discussions on how I used the elements of the set in designing different lighting looks for each location. I will also discuss how I used automated fixtures in combination with conventional stage lighting instruments and LED technology to help with the creation of the different lighting looks. When using different types of lighting fixtures, a lighting designer must adjust and adapt to incorporate the lights in a way that augments the design. Included are discussions on how the set was used, how the lighting designer and projection designer worked together and compromised, and how full-scale puppets mixed with live action made the lighting design challenging. There is a brief section on the history of J. M. Barrie and his original story and how it has evolved through the well-known Disney version and the live-action, more sinister movie, Hook, that I personally grew up watching. Within the research there are images that influenced my final design as well as Photoshop[upper case TM]renderings of scenes that I presented to the director and cast during rehearsal to convey the feeling and mood of each locale. This thesis also {{serves as a}} performance report and therefore includes some of the tools that the lighting designer uses to communicate with the lighting crew. There are two plates of the <b>lighting</b> <b>plot</b> and the entire channel hookup; pieces of paper given to the master electrician so that the show can be hung and focused. The conclusion is a brief summary of how I feel I executed the design and contributed to the production as a whole. As always, a lighting designer sees things in performances of the show that he or she would have done differently and I will touch on them as well...|$|E
