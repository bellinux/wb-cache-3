The process allows yecovery of conventional fertilizers and chromium metal. The control scheme uses a PSV (l'recomputed Setpoint Values) technique to achieve total conversion of both hexavalent chromium and nitrous acid. Such strategy enables low cost microcomputers to control the process. Metalplating wastewaters contain a considerable amount of chromic acid, a strongly hszardous contaminant whose main constituent is a valuable metal. For this reason...|$|E

40|$|Background: HIV/AIDS {{remains one}} of the most serious current threats to global public health. Although anti-HIV drugs have been {{effective}} among the wealthiest populations, a vaccine and/or new methods to prevent infections are needed <b>lo</b> <b>control</b> HIV globally. Strategies to combat HIV- 1 require structural knowledge of how antibodies recognize HIV envelope proteins and how the immune system eliminates viruses. Until recently, only a small number of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV- 1 had been characterized, and the immunological basis for their breadth and potency remains poorly understood. However. it was recently demonstrated that antibodies could be engineered to greatly enhance their breadth and potency (Diskin et al., Science 2011). Unfortunately, this and other engineering efforts have resulted in a decrease in antibody half-life in mouse and non-human primate models. This decrease in half-life correlates with an increase in reactivity to a variety of antigens, termed polyreactivity. Methods: In order to make better targets for passive delivery therapies, we are working to increase the half-life of antibodies while maintaining their breadth and potency using a variety of computational and structured-based techniques. One technique involves reducing the spatial aggregation propensity, in which an algorithm finds dynamically exposed hydrophobic patches on the surlace of proteins (Chemansetty et al., PNAS 2009). To this end, we have constructed several mutations in regions that have been predicted to have high aggregation propensities, and have tested them for polyreactivity and potency in neutralization assays. Results: Initial results show that these novel reagents have reduced polyreactivily, yet they still maintain their potency in in vitro neutralization assays. Conclusions: We are currently pursuing in vivo experiments in mice to further understand the relationship between antibody potency, polyreactivity, and half-life...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} {{evidence about the}} inappropriate use of medications by older people, {{there is very little}} published evidence about the control and monitoring of neuroleptic drugs used in nursing homes. As others have indicated, this is all the more worrying when set {{in the context of the}} paucity of research on nursing home care and the trend to replace registered nurses with untrained care assistants. In the United States, legislation in the form of the Nursing Home Reform Act (OBRA 1987) was introduced, in part, to regulate the prescribing and administration of neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs. No such legislation exists in Canada or the United Kingdom. In the case of the latter jurisdiction, the recent Royal Commission on Long-Term Care for older people (The Stationery Office, 1999) has recommended a national care commission to monitor care, and set assessment and quality benchmarks. In Canada this debate has not even begun, and the purpose of this paper is not to ignite controversy, but to raise questions about the use of these drugs with nursing home residents. Voluntary guidelines and education of physicians, nurses and care attendants would be infinitely better than legislation. In the meantime, we need research to address the following questions: For what reasons should these drugs be given to older people? Are these drugs being used appropriately? Is the risk of side-effects too great with these drugs? Are the numbers and type of staff employed in nursing homes adequate/qualified to detect and report side-effects? How well do these drugs manage the behaviours they are given <b>lo</b> <b>control?</b> Are they being used as chemical restraints or to make the older person compliant? Are the so-called 'atypical' neuroleptic drugs any better? What we offer in this article is background information that might encourage others to not only review their practice but also to address these questions. Ye...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Interest in {{alternative}} imaging, {{with an emphasis}} on medical and security applications, is increasing. The terahertz spectrum is beginning to be explored for these applications. A prototype scanning imaging system is described here. This system currently operates at 1. 6 THz and uses a HEB as a heterodyne detection element. Object scanning is accomplished by using an oscillating mirror running at 8 Hz with a scanning angle of 30 º. Theoretical calculations for this system yield a thermal resolution of better than 0. 5 K with an integration time of 1 ms. This calculation is based on a system noise temperature of 1000 K at the image and neglects the effects of system gain fluctuations. At this time, the system’s RMS thermal noise level is 1 K with an integration time of 1 second. A major component of the system is IF gain stabilization through active <b>LO</b> power <b>control.</b> Currently, the <b>LO</b> power <b>control</b> is under development. Completion of this subsystem is likely to greatly enhance thermal resolution. Further improvements [...] specifically, faster scan rates optimized to the stabilized IF output [...] can then be pursued. Index Terms—HEB, hot electron bolometer, THz, terahertz, imaging...|$|R

50|$|Although the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point {{is often}} {{referred}} to as a railway crossing, it is in fact a pedestrian crossing, unlike the <b>Lo</b> Wu <b>Control</b> Point, where no bus or any other public transport can reach. Furthermore, there is no through-train service, as the railway line is not connected with the railways in mainland China. And although the bulk of the users are train passengers, the Lok Ma Chau pedestrian crossing can also be reached by bus, taxi and mini bus from various parts of the New Territories.|$|R
50|$|However, 24-hour border-crossing at <b>Lo</b> Wu <b>control</b> {{point is}} still {{undergoing}} vigorous debates mainly arguing about {{the limited number}} of passengers at night.

This new policy has both advantages and disadvantages. It is clear that trade and transportation and logistic links between mainland China and Hong Kong will flourish. However, it may also cause some social problems since it eases the way to go from Hong Kong to mainland China.|$|R
