5|$|Born on 5 March 1326, <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> {{the third}} son of Charles I of Hungary and his wife, Elizabeth of Poland. He {{was named for}} his father's uncle, Louis, Bishop of Toulouse, canonized in 1317. The first-born son of his parents, Charles, died before <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> born. Louis became his father's heir {{after the death of}} his brother Ladislaus in 1329.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth's {{marriage}} to <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> celebrated in Buda on 20 June 1353. The couple were related within the prohibited degree of kinship, Duke CasimirI of Kuyavia being Elizabeth's maternal great-great-grandfather and Louis' maternal great-grandfather. A papal dispensation was thus necessary, {{but it was}} only sought four months after the wedding took place. The historian Iván Bertényi suggests that the ceremony may have been hastened by an unintended pregnancy, as the couple had been in contact for years. If so, the pregnancy likely ended in a stillbirth. Elizabeth's mother had apparently died {{by the time she was}} married. <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> dismayed when, upon his father-in-law's death later the same year, Elizabeth's young and ambitious cousin Tvrtko ascended the Bosnian throne. In 1357, Louis summoned the young Ban to Požega and compelled him to surrender most of western Zachlumia as Elizabeth's dowry.|$|E

50|$|St. <b>Louis</b> <b>is</b> a Canadian {{village in}} the {{province}} of Saskatchewan, south of Prince Albert and northeast of Batoche. It was founded by Métis settlers in the late 19th century, and is the northernmost Southbranch Settlement, a series of communities which range from Fish Creek in the south along the South Saskatchewan River through Batoche and St. Laurent to St. <b>Louis.</b> St. <b>Louis</b> <b>is</b> within the boundaries of the rural municipality St. Louis No. 431.

5|$|In 1244 {{a band of}} Khwarezmian mercenaries {{travelling}} to Egypt {{to serve}} As-Salih Ismail, Emir of Damascus, seemingly of their own volition, captured Jerusalem en route and defeated a combined Christian and Syrian army at the Battle of La Forbie. In response, LouisIX, king of France, organised a Crusade, called the Seventh Crusade, to attack Egypt, arriving in 1249. It was not a success. <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> defeated at Mansura and captured as he retreated to Damietta. Another truce was agreed upon for a ten-year period, and <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> ransomed. Louis remained in Syria until 1254 to consolidate the Crusader states. From 1265 to 1271, the Mamluk sultan Baibars drove the Franks to a few small coastal outposts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> born as Ludwig Alexander von Battenberg in Graz, Styria, {{the eldest}} son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine by his morganatic {{marriage}} to Countess Julia von Hauke. Because of his morganatic parentage, <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> denied his father's rank in the Grand Duchy of Hesse; and, from birth, his style of Illustrious Highness and title of Count of Battenberg instead derived from the rank given to his mother {{at the time of}} her marriage. On 26 December 1858, he automatically became His Serene Highness Prince Louis of Battenberg when his mother was elevated to Princess of Battenberg with the style of Serene Highness, by decree of her husband's brother, Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse.|$|E
5|$|Saint <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> {{disarmed}} and decommissioned on 8 February {{and became}} a training ship for stokers and engineers in Toulon. The ship was condemned on 20 June 1920, although she was converted into an accommodation hulk. Saint Louis listed for disposal on 29 June 1931, but was not purchased, for 600,230 francs, until 24 May 1933.|$|E
50|$|Port <b>Louis</b> <b>is</b> the {{financial}} center of Mauritius, which has established itself as safe and trusted location for conducting business {{due to its}} strong democracy, political stability, and multilingual population. Located in Port <b>Louis</b> <b>is</b> the Stock Exchange of Mauritius. Also in Port <b>Louis</b> <b>are</b> over ten commercial banks that serve both domestic and offshore clients, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, leasing companies, and foreign exchange dealers.

5|$|The {{cultural}} {{impact of}} the Second Crusade was even greater in France, with many troubadours fascinated by the alleged affair between Eleanor and Raymond, which helped to feed the theme of courtly love. Unlike Conrad, the image of <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> improved by the Crusade {{with many of the}} French seeing him as a suffering pilgrim king who quietly bore God's punishments.|$|E
5|$|The name of <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> {{bestowed}} {{because it}} was typical of a prince of France; Stanislas was chosen to honour his great-grandfather King Stanisław I of Poland; and Xavier was chosen for Saint Francis Xavier, whom his mother's family held {{as one of their}} patron saints.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} older French pre-dreadnoughts, the ship's first mission in the war was to escort troop convoys from North Africa to France. On 23 September, Saint <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> ordered to Port Said to escort a British convoy {{carrying}} troops from India. She remained on escort duties until November when she was ordered to the Dardanelles to guard against a sortie by the German battlecruiser Goeben. The ship remained on station there until January 1915 when she was given a brief refit at Bizerte. Upon its completion, Saint <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> ordered to the Eastern Mediterranean where she became the flagship of the newly formed Syrian Squadron (escadre de Syrie) on 9 February. These ships were intended to attack Turkish positions and lines of communication in Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and the Sinai Peninsula. Saint Louis participated in the bombardment of Gaza and El Arish in April before she was transferred back to the Dardanelles in May.|$|E

5|$|After {{her return}} to International Mercantile Marine (IMM), the ship {{underwent}} a refit at the W. & A. Fletcher Marine Works yard in Hoboken that outfitted her for 242 first-, 310 second-, and 876 third-class passengers. On 8 January 1920, while Kroonland was still under repair, the American Line ship , berthed next {{to her at the}} Fletcher yard, caught fire. In the multi-alarm fire, firefighters believed that St. <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> a lost cause, and so focused their efforts on saving Kroonland. At one point, St. Louis heeled over and leaned on Kroonland but the only resulting damages were scorch marks on her side.|$|E
5|$|Among the downsides {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} was pollution. Brick firing produced {{particulate air pollution}} and paint-making created lead dust, while beer and liquor brewing produced grain swill. The worst pollution was coal dust and smoke, for which St. <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> infamous by the 1890s. The greatest number of complaints to the St. Louis Board of Health were due to industries engaged in rendering, which produced noxious fumes. In spite of this, pollution control was hindered {{by a desire to}} promote growth. One of the few controls began in 1880, in which regulations would be enforced strictly in some areas while little in others, thereby encouraging factories to concentrate in industrial districts.|$|E
5|$|Born in Avignon on 22 February 1717, Crillon was {{a member}} of a {{distinguished}} family that had originated in Chieri, Piedmont. His branch of the family had a long history of military service to the French crown. A descendant of the famous 16th-century general Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon ("the brave Crillon"), he was the son of the 3rd Duke of Crillon, François Félix de Berton des Balbes, and Marie-Thérèse de Fabry de Moncault. <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> the first-born of the couple's six children (four boys and two girls).|$|E

5|$|From 1876, the South Saskatchewan river {{crossing}} at St. <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> via ferry. In 1912, the railway built a rail {{bridge across the}} river, and in 1928, the vehicle lanes were added. After 1907, the highway was constructed south of Chamberlain and reached Buffalo Pound. At this time two horse scrapers and walking plows were the implements of road construction technology. This highway received an improvement in 1926 which then used an elevating grader, 16 horses and a dump wagon.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the losses}} of {{industry}} and jobs, St. Louis has had significant and persistent problems with both crime and perceptions of crime. In 2011 St. <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> named by U.S. News and World Report as the most dangerous city in the United States, using Uniform Crime Reports data published by the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, St. <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> named as the city with the highest crime rate in the United States by CQ Press in 2010, using data reported to the FBI in 2009. Critics of these analyses note that division between St. Louis City and St. Louis County make crime reports for the area appear inflated, and that reporting crime differs greatly depending on the localities involved. The FBI cautioned against using this data {{as a form of}} ranking, as it presents too simplistic a view of crime. From 2006 to 2007, the rate of city youth to be killed by guns was the second-highest in the United States, according to data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of firearm deaths for the metropolitan statistical area was one-fifth of the city rate.|$|E
5|$|Henry's plans shifted {{when the}} Empress Matilda's husband, the Emperor Henry, died in 1125. King Henry {{recalled}} {{his daughter to}} England {{the next year and}} declared that, should he die without a male heir, she was to be his rightful successor. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have. Putting forward a woman as a potential heir in this way was unusual: opposition to Matilda continued to exist within the English court, and <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> vehemently opposed to her candidacy.|$|E

5|$|In April 1771, Louis Stanislas' {{education}} was formally concluded {{and his own}} independent household was established, which astounded contemporaries with its extravagance: in 1773, the number of servants reached 390. In the same month his household was founded, <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> granted several titles by his grandfather, Louis XV: Duke of Anjou, Count of Maine, Count of Perche, and Count of Senoches. During this period {{of his life he}} was often known by the title Count of Provence.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for a war against Bohemia, Louis ordered the mobilization of the royal army and marched to Trencsén (now Trenčín in Slovakia). However, his supposed allies (Rudolf IV of Austria, Meihnard III of Tyrol and Casimir III of Poland) failed to join him, and the emperor initiated negotiations that lasted for months with the mediation of Casimir III. <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> finally reconciled with Charles IV at their meeting in Uherské Hradiště on 8 May 1363.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{governor}} of the Indiana Territory governed the Louisiana District (which included St. Louis), and the district's organizational law forbade the foreign slave trade and reduced the influence of St. Louis in the region. Wealthy St. Louisans petitioned Congress to review the system, and in July 1805, Congress reorganized the Louisiana District as the Louisiana Territory, with its territorial capital at St. Louis and its own territorial governor. From the division of the Louisiana Territory in 1812 to Missouri statehood in 1821, St. <b>Louis</b> <b>was</b> the capital of the Missouri Territory.|$|E
