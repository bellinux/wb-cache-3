5|$|Published by Scholastic {{as part of}} its Hello reader! series, Margo Lundell adapted {{three stories}} from the novels into a series of 48 page picture books with {{illustration}} by Don Bolognese. The first book, <b>Lad,</b> a Dog: <b>Lad</b> to the Rescue, was released in August 1997 and adapts the story of <b>Lad</b> saving the baby from a snake. The next two, <b>Lad,</b> a Dog: Best Dog in the World (December 1997) and <b>Lad,</b> a Dog: <b>Lad</b> is Lost (February 1998) focus on Lad's first dog show and subsequently becoming lost. The final book, <b>Lad,</b> a Dog: The Bad Puppy, released in May 1998, details Lad's raising of Wolf.|$|E
5|$|A couple, {{referred}} to {{only as the}} Master and Mistress, purchase a pure-bred rough collie named <b>Lad</b> to be the guard dog of their home, the Place. Though they are surprised when they receive a puppy instead of an adult dog, they decide to keep him and he quickly shows himself to be very intelligent and easily trainable. At first, <b>Lad</b> views all people as friends, including a burglar who robs the house one night. When the man climbs out the window {{with a bag of}} loot, <b>Lad</b> thinks he is playing a game and snatches the bag in play. The thief chases <b>Lad,</b> then shoots him to get back the bag. <b>Lad</b> realizes the man is not friendly and turns to attack him, but the thief falls into a ditch, knocking himself unconscious. Afterward, <b>Lad</b> no longer trusts strangers so easily and has become a true watchdog.|$|E
5|$|A rough collie named <b>Lad</b> {{lives at}} the Place with his Master, Mistress, and his mate, Lady. When Knave, a younger collie, is boarded at the Place, Lady begins {{ignoring}} <b>Lad</b> {{in favor of the}} newcomer. During a romp in the forest with Knave, Lady is caught in a leghold trap. Knave leaves her there and returns home but <b>Lad</b> finds her. Several days later, the still limping Lady accidentally gets locked in the library and is subsequently blamed for the destruction of the Master's beloved mounted bald eagle. The Master starts to whip her, but <b>Lad</b> intervenes and takes the whipping himself, knowing Knave was the culprit. Later, he attacks Knave for getting Lady in trouble, sending him fleeing from the Place. As the Master apologizes to <b>Lad,</b> Lady lovingly licks his wounds from the fight.|$|E
50|$|When {{the bill}} of <b>lading</b> {{is used as a}} {{document}} of title, it is particularly related to the case of buyer. When the buyer is entitled to received goods from the carrier, bill of <b>lading</b> in this case performs as document of title for the goods. There are two types of bill of <b>lading</b> that can perform as document of title. They are straight bill of <b>lading</b> and order bill of <b>lading.</b> Straight bill of <b>lading</b> is a bill of <b>lading</b> issued to a named consignee that is not negotiable. In this case, {{the bill of}} <b>lading</b> should be directed only to one specific consignee indicated on the bill of <b>lading.</b> Order bill of <b>lading</b> is the opposite from a straight bill of <b>lading</b> and there is no specific or named consignee. Therefore, an order bill of <b>lading</b> can be negotiated to a third party.|$|R
5000|$|A bill of <b>lading</b> that denotes that {{merchandise}} is in {{good condition}} upon being received by the shipping carrier {{is referred to as}} a [...] "clean" [...] bill of <b>lading,</b> while a bill of <b>lading</b> that denotes that merchandise has incurred damage prior to being received by the shipping carrier would be known as a [...] "foul" [...] or [...] "claused" [...] bill of <b>lading.</b> A claused bill of <b>lading</b> will have a statement (clause) written onto the bill of <b>lading</b> noting down any damage or other issues. Letters of credit usually will not allow for foul bills of <b>lading,</b> and the buyer is not obliged to accept any bill of <b>lading</b> that is not clean.|$|R

5|$|After his return, <b>Lad</b> is bred {{with another}} prize-winning collie, Lady, {{and they have}} two male puppies which are named Little <b>Lad</b> and Wolf. Angela is allowed her choice of one as a present to her when they {{are old enough to}} leave their mother & she chooses Little <b>Lad.</b> However, Jackson White (Jack Daly), a poacher <b>Lad</b> fought and chased off the {{property}} before, sets fire to barn out of vengeance. Elizabeth is injured and Little <b>Lad</b> is killed but not Wolf. <b>Lad</b> later aids in capturing White when he breaks into the house to try to steal Lad's gold trophy from the dog show. Angela is initially inconsolable over the loss of her puppy Little <b>Lad,</b> and refuses {{to have anything to do}} with Wolf. After he is nearly lost in another accident, she changes her mind and accepts Wolf as her new dog.|$|E
5|$|At 16, {{the aging}} <b>Lad</b> befriends Sonya, a seven-year-old girl whose father {{works at the}} Place. Her father forces her to assist him with his work, then brutally mistreats her if she is slow. The Master and the Place's {{superintendent}} try to quell the behavior, with no success. During a walk with the girl, <b>Lad</b> protects her from her father. The next day, while the Master and Mistress are at a show and the other workers are off on holiday, Sonya's father starts to beat her for accidentally dropping a heavy basket. <b>Lad</b> comes to her rescue and they retreat to the veranda where she pets him while he sleeps. When Sonya goes to the barn, her father is waiting for her and closes the door. Somehow she senses <b>Lad</b> beside her, which gives her the courage {{to stand up to}} her father. The man imagines he sees <b>Lad</b> beside her and runs away in fear. Unknown to both, <b>Lad</b> had died in his sleep and the Master and Mistress were crying over his body on the veranda.|$|E
5|$|Available {{evidence}} indicates that the real <b>Lad</b> was born in December 1902, and that unlike his fictional counterpart, <b>Lad</b> was a collie of unknown lineage with no American Kennel Club registration papers. After living five years with a heart tumor, the dog died on September 3, 1918 and his obituary was featured on a multi-page spread of the September 14, 1918 issue of Field and Fancy magazine. Terhune reported that he received hundreds of letters from fans asking him to publish more stories about <b>Lad,</b> and that over 1,700 people visit Lad's grave at Sunnybank. In 1922, he collected together eleven more short stories into a novel; the stories were published earlier in The Ladies' Home Journal, with some new stories and some from other magazines. The new set of stories primarily revolved around the themes of right and wrong, abuse of authority, and justice. Intending {{it to be the}} last book he would write about his late collie, Terhune killed the fictional <b>Lad</b> in the last chapter of the novel. The novel was published by George H. Doran as Further Adventures of <b>Lad.</b> Seven years and twenty other novels later, he would change his mind and release one more <b>Lad</b> novel, <b>Lad</b> of Sunnybank, which was published by HarperCollins.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} where bill of <b>lading</b> {{can be used as}} carrier's receipt for goods. The first is on board bill of <b>lading,</b> also known as clean bill of <b>lading.</b> Clean bill of <b>lading</b> is used when there is no {{discrepancy}} between description filled by shipper and the actual goods shipped on board. Clean bill of <b>lading</b> indicates that the goods have been properly loaded on board the carrier's ship according to the prima facie evidence. If the carrier finds out that the bill of <b>lading</b> is different from goods on board, one can provide contradictory evidence on clean bill of <b>lading.</b> It is valid as long as in the hand of the carrier, but once it is transferred and negotiated to the third party, it cannot be rebutted and the carrier can no longer mark discrepancy. The second is claused bill of <b>lading.</b> Claused bill of <b>lading</b> is used when there is some discrepancy between description in the bill of <b>lading</b> and the actual goods. For claused bill of <b>lading,</b> one can mark only when the goods are loaded.|$|R

5|$|Due to city regulations, the Master and Mistress {{are forced}} to muzzle <b>Lad</b> when they take him from the show. During the drive out of the city, <b>Lad</b> falls {{out of the car}} and is left behind. After he realizes he is lost, <b>Lad</b> starts towards home. Along the way he is chased by the police and a crowd of people, who presume he is rabid, but he escapes them by {{swimming}} across the Hudson River. Later he is attacked by a mongrel guard dog, but he refuses to run from the battle. He initially struggles to defend himself while muzzled, but then the other dog inadvertently bites through the strap holding the muzzle on, allowing <b>Lad</b> to quickly defeat him. When the Master and Mistress return from searching for <b>Lad,</b> they find him waiting on the porch.|$|E
5|$|Lady {{gives birth}} to three puppies, but after two die of unexplained causes, Lady lavishes all her {{attention}} on the surviving pup, Wolf. She later develops distemper and is taken away by the veterinarian, so <b>Lad</b> takes over the raising of his son, solemnly teaching him the Law of the Place. Wolf comes to love and respect his father and soon forgets his mother, though <b>Lad</b> continues to search for her daily. A month later, Wolf falls through the ice of the semi-frozen lake, and <b>Lad</b> nearly drowns while saving him. When <b>Lad</b> staggers to shore, he is ecstatically greeted by the recovered Lady.|$|E
5|$|On a cold, snowy day, thirteen-year-old <b>Lad</b> feels snubbed {{when the}} three-year-old Wolf does not {{invite him to}} join him and Rex, a five-year-old collie and bull terrier mix, for a run in the woods. Later, <b>Lad</b> goes for a walk, {{following}} their path. When he meets them on the trail, rather than letting <b>Lad</b> pass, Rex viciously attacks him. With his teeth dulled by old age, <b>Lad</b> is unable to really fight back. Refusing to just run, he defends himself as best he can while moving backwards towards home, half a mile away. Though Wolf betrays him and joins Rex in the life-or-death fight, <b>Lad</b> manages to {{get close enough to}} the house for Bruce to hear the battle and alert the Master and Mistress. The Master is forced to kill Rex after the crazed dog turns on him. After four weeks recovering from his wounds, <b>Lad</b> is able to go outside again and Wolf steps aside for him, acknowledging he is still the leader of the Place's dogs.|$|E

40|$|LL. D. The bill of <b>lading</b> in South African law is {{the theme}} of this study. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the bill of <b>lading</b> in its {{traditional}} paper form is examined. The aim of the first part of the study is to reconcile the bill of <b>lading</b> that is based on English law with the principles of South African law, especially regarding concepts such as possession and ownership. A plea is made for the application of South African law to bills of <b>lading</b> rather than English law exclusively. Even though English law undoubtedly forms the basis of the law governing bills of <b>lading,</b> such law should be applied in a way that is consistent with the general principles of South African law. The functions of the bill of <b>lading</b> are considered in detail, particularly the bill of <b>lading</b> as a document of title. A submission is made of five characteristics of a document of title. The conclusion is that the bill of <b>lading,</b> though based on English law concepts, can be integrated into South African law without difficulty. The subsequent examination of the transfer of contractual rights and the imposition of liabilities will show that there is a dire need for new legislation in South Africa to replace an English Act of 1855. The current proposals for such legislation are, however, in need of extensive revision. The fact that the traditional bill of <b>lading</b> only arrives at the port of destination after the goods, leads to a multitude of problems. The carrier may only deliver the goods in exchange for a bill of <b>lading.</b> Letters of indemnity are therefore used to protect the carrier that delivers the goods without receiving a bill of <b>lading.</b> Such indemnities will be enforceable in South African law if the carrier has no reason to suspect that the receiver of the goods is not entitled to delivery. The consideration of the nature and functions of the traditional bill of <b>lading,</b> enables the study to progress to an examination of an electronic bill of <b>lading.</b> The use of an electronic bill of <b>lading</b> means that many problems facing the traditional bill of <b>lading</b> can be avoided. The continuing evolution of the bill of <b>lading</b> will be examined against the background of electronic commerce. Writing and signature requirements should not inhibit the development of an electronic bill of <b>lading.</b> The difficulty facing the dematerialisation of the bill of <b>lading</b> is providing for negotiability in an electronic environment, and ensuring that an electronic bill of <b>lading</b> is the equivalent of an original and unique paper bill of <b>lading.</b> It is possible to create an electronic bill of <b>lading</b> that performs all the functions of a traditional bill of <b>lading,</b> and there are examples of the use of such electronic bills of <b>lading</b> in practice. Delivery of the goods can take place by way of attomment rather than the usual symbolical delivery following the transfer of a paper bill of <b>lading.</b> It is submitted that there is currently no need for legislative intervention to provide for electronic bills of <b>lading</b> in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|In their article, Land Assembly Districts, Professors Michael Heller and Rick Hills {{address the}} {{collective}} action problem arising from excessively fragmented land. They propose an innovative solution: Land Assembly Districts (or <b>LADs).</b> In this Article, I raise several concerns regarding <b>LADs</b> {{in particular and}} majoritarian land assembly in general. <b>LADs</b> rely on majority voting by a neighborhood 2 ̆ 7 s existing owners. Yet majority voting, coupled {{with the possibility of}} heterogeneity, means that <b>LADs</b> may both approve socially undesirable assemblies and disapprove socially desirable ones. <b>LADs</b> also permit owners to bargain over a project 2 ̆ 7 s surplus. But such bargaining creates additional costs for developers, as well as a potential bilateral monopoly problem, both of which may result in fewer desirable assemblies. There is thus no reason to believe a priori that <b>LADs</b> are superior to either eminent domain or private assembly. Finally, because <b>LADs</b> require courts to delineate the circumstances in which eminent domain would continue to be permitted, <b>LADs</b> may not even offer an administrability advantage. Indeed, <b>LADs</b> ultimately may rely on judicial expertise to an extent the authors themselves believe is problematic. Still, <b>LADs</b> constitute a creative proposal worthy of consideration...|$|R
5|$|The Master and Mistress enter <b>Lad</b> in the Westminster Dog Show in New York, much to Lad's abject misery as he dislikes the preparatory bathing and brushing. Dismayed {{to learn}} that <b>Lad</b> will have to stay chained to a small bench for all four days of the event, his owners begin to regret {{bringing}} him. To their joy, <b>Lad</b> wins the blue ribbon in both the Novice and Winner classes, and they decide not to subject him to the four-day stay.

When the bear he fought earlier rushes past with singed fur, <b>Lad</b> chews through his rope and follows the other animals of the forest to sit in a nearby lake.

5|$|While in {{town with}} the Mistress, <b>Lad</b> saves her from {{an attack by}} a sick dog being chased {{by the police and}} other citizens, who believe it to be rabid. The dog is shot and the upset Mistress, who knew it was not really rabid, goes home. The next day, the town constable comes by boat to the Place to execute <b>Lad</b> under the notion that he is now rabid. The Master argues that the other dog was not rabid and refuses to allow <b>Lad</b> to be shot, {{ordering}} the officer off his property. As the man is leaving, his boat overturns. Unable to swim, he is in danger of drowning until <b>Lad</b> jumps in and brings him back to shore. The grateful officer states that he killed the dog he came to kill and <b>Lad</b> only looks a little like him.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{traditional}} bill of <b>lading</b> is {{of great}} value in the maritime industry. However, as electronic communication takes over in international trade, the electronic bill of <b>lading</b> is now being considered first in some situations. A brief introduction {{of the bill of}} <b>lading</b> will be made together with a general comparison between the traditional bill of <b>lading</b> and the electronic bill of <b>lading.</b> Further analysis will concentrate on the issues of how the electronic bill of <b>lading</b> applies in some particular international e-commerce cases and how we can improve the new electronic data interchange system. Finally, this paper aims to demonstrate that it may be advantageous to ultimately switch entirely from the paper bill of <b>lading</b> to an electronic one in a modern e-commerce-driven society...|$|R

5|$|Albert Payson Terhune was an {{established}} newspaperman {{and author of}} several books in various genresincluding histories and thrillerswhen he penned his first canine short story, His Mate. Ray Long, then editor for Red Book Magazine, had jokingly suggested he write a story about <b>Lad</b> one afternoon, when the reticent dog put his head on Long's knee after having snubbed the familiar visitor for the last year. Having already tried to market the idea of his writing dog stories to magazines for several years, Terhune readily agreed. The first story featured three rough collies, <b>Lad,</b> Lady, and Knave, and used a similar formula to his previous works: an average male (<b>Lad)</b> protects a beautiful female (Lady) from a larger villain (Knave). Long purchased the work for Red Book for $200 and it was published in the January 1916 issue. Four magazines requested similar stories, and Terhune complied, finding them easy to write and sell. Additional stories, all featuring <b>Lad</b> and titled <b>Lad</b> Stories, were published in the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies' Home Journal, Hartford Courant, and the Atlantic Monthly, though Red Book remained his most consistent publisher. By 1918, the stories had grown in popularity and Terhune was paid an average of $1000 each for the tales, with some selling for as much as $2,500,. Though marketed as fiction, even people who were acquainted with the Terhunes and <b>Lad</b> reportedly believed that the stories were real.|$|E
5|$|Building on {{the success}} of Lad: A Dog, Terhune went on to pen thirty {{additional}} canine novels, including two featuring <b>Lad.</b> Further Adventures of <b>Lad,</b> which includes the stories of his arrival at the Place and his death, was published in George H. Doran in 1922. Like the first, it {{went on to become a}} best seller, praised by both new readers and existing fans. Critics, however, gave it more mixed reviews. Though some praised the stories and <b>Lad,</b> others felt <b>Lad</b> was unbelievable and harshly denounced Terhune's writing style. <b>Lad</b> of Sunnybank was released in 1929 by HarperCollins, and included another selection of stories about Lad's life. Two of the collies that appear in Lad: A Dog, Lad's son Wolf and another collie named Bruce, both received their own novels. Bruce was published by E. P. Dutton in 1920 and Wolf was published by Doran in 1925.|$|E
