40|$|This master {{thesis is}} {{supported}} by Ericsson to conduct research on immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> of electronics. By this technology, the liquid will be {{in direct contact with}} the electronics. The research begins with investigations in industrial background, literature review and theory in heat transfer. According to the knowledge from those investigations, different <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> systems including indirect, direct and immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> systems are introduced. The experiment consists of three parts: air cooling, single-phase and two-phase <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling.</b> Those three parts are with the same test board with adjustable heat resources in the same geometry. In the first part, an air flow channel is used for testing air cooling, by which immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> can be compared to traditional technology. In the second part, an immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> system is designed and constructed with detailed explanation. Liquid NovecTM 7200 is used as working liquid. In the third part, a huge number of data has been collected during the whole process of boiling, through which a boiling curve for NovecTM 7200 has been acquired. Then comparisons between those three technologies have been made. The feasibility of immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> on an industrial scale has also been discussed. Based on the experiments and analyses, a careful conclusion that electronics with <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> has a larger heat flux limit than with today’s air cooling but with some practical problems can be drawn...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Three-dimensional (3 D) {{circuits}} reduce communication de-lay in multicore SoCs, {{and enable}} efficient integration of cores, memories, sensors, and RF devices. However, vertical integration of layers exacer-bates {{the reliability and}} thermal problems, and cooling efficiency becomes a limiting factor. <b>Liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> is a solution to overcome the accelerated thermal problems imposed by multi-layer architectures. In this paper, we first provide a 3 D thermal simulation model including <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling,</b> supporting both fixed and variable fluid injection rates. Our model has been integrated in HotSpot to study the impact on multicore SoCs. We design and evaluate several dynamic management policies that complement <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling.</b> Our results for 3 D multicore SoCs, {{which are based on}} 3 D versions of UltraSPARC T 1, show that thermal management approaches that combine <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> with proactive task allocation are extremely effective in preventing temperature problems. Our proactive management technique provides an additional 75 % average reduction in hot spots in comparison to applying only <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling.</b> Furthermore, for systems capable of varying the coolant flow rate at runtime, our feedback controller increases the improvement to 95 % on average.

2500|$|The Revolution {{engine is}} based on the VR-1000 Superbike race program, co-developed by Harley-Davidson's Powertrain Engineering team and Porsche Engineering in Stuttgart, Germany. It is a <b>liquid</b> <b>cooled,</b> dual {{overhead}} cam, internally counterbalanced 60degree V-twin engine with a displacement of 69cubicinch (1,130cm³), producing [...] at 8,250rpm at the crank, with a redline of 9,000rpm. It was introduced for the new VRSC (V-Rod) line in 2001 for the 2002 model year, starting with the single VRSCA (V-Twin Racing Street Custom) model. The Revolution marks Harley's first collaboration with Porsche since the V4 Nova project, which, like the V-Rod, was a radical departure from Harley's traditional lineup until it was cancelled by AMF in 1981 in favor of the Evolution engine.|$|E
2500|$|Like Blackburn, Vickers {{chose the}} 825hp (615kW) Rolls Royce H10 engine, later called the Buzzard IIIMS, a <b>liquid</b> <b>cooled</b> V-12 to power their aircraft. [...] The Type 207 was a single-bay biplane, without sweep or stagger and with wings of almost equal span. [...] The upper wing carried Handley Page slots and Frise ailerons; the lower wing alone had dihedral. [...] Both wings used the {{relatively}} thick and still novel Raf34 airfoil section; they folded for storage. [...] The rudder was balanced and the braced tailplane carried aerodynamic servo-assisted elevators operated via trailing edge tabs. [...] Barnes Wallis {{had recently been}} appointed chief structural engineer for Vickers aircraft and he brought to the Type 207 new methods of duralumin construction in both wings and fuselage from his previous work on airships. [...] Typically, these structures were complicated but light. [...] The aircraft was fabric-covered throughout.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{termination}} of the Tornado project, Sydney Camm and his design team transferred the alternative engine proposals for the Tornado to the more advanced Tempest. Thus, it was designed from the outset to use the Bristol Centaurus 18 cylinder radial engine {{as an alternative to the}} <b>liquid</b> <b>cooled</b> engines which were also proposed. A pair of Centaurus-powered Tempest Mk II prototypes were completed. Apart from the new engine and cowling, the Tempest II prototypes were similar to early series Tempest Vs. The Centaurus engine was closely cowled and the exhaust stacks grouped behind and to either side of the engine: to the rear were air outlets with automatic sliding [...] "gills". The carburettor air intakes were in the inner leading edges of both wings, an oil cooler and air intake were present in the inner starboard wing. The engine installation owed much to examinations of a captured Focke-Wulf Fw 190, and was clean and effective.|$|E

2500|$|The D.IX had a {{fuselage}} of the Klinkerrumpf (clinker-built fuselage) type, roughly circular {{in cross}} section and built from overlapping longitudinal strips of spruce over a light, wooden frame, pioneered by LFG on the D.IV and used on the D.VI, D.VII and D.VIII. Because of the shortness and large diameter of the [...] Siemens-Halske Sh.III geared rotary of the first prototype, {{the nose of the}} new fighter was short and blunt compared with those of the earlier aircraft, which had all used <b>liquid</b> <b>cooled</b> V engines. Nonetheless, the metal oil deflecting cowling was carefully blended into the wooden fuselage. The rotary engine drove a four blade propeller, an unusual feature at this time and only fitted to one other LFG fighter, the later D.XVI. [...] The tailplane of the fighter was straight edged with blunt tips and slightly rounded, split elevators. [...] Its vertical tail repeated the small ventral fin of the D.VI and later Rolands and the rudder was similarly deep and rounded, but the tail surfaces of the second prototype were much enlarged and the rudder of the third horn balanced. [...] The D.IX's conventional undercarriage was of the single axle type, mounted on V-struts to the lower fuselage and with a tailskid attached to the ventral fin.|$|E
