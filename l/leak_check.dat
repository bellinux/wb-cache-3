50|$|Soyuz TMA-05M {{completed}} a successful docking at 4:51 GMT while {{the space station}} was flying high above North-East Kazakhstan: one minute earlier than planned. Shortly after, the docking probe was retracted and hooks started closing to establish the hard mate. The hard mate {{was followed by the}} standard one-hour <b>leak</b> <b>check</b> operations. After leak checks were completed, the crew opened the hatches and floated into the ISS. The arrival of Malenchenko, Williams and Hoshide on board Soyuz TMA-05M restored the space station's crew to full strength at six.|$|E
5000|$|When the {{aircraft}} arrived from London earlier that morning, the previous flight crew had reported a frozen door seal and abnormal noises {{coming from the}} right aft service door. They requested a full inspection of the door. The inspection {{was carried out by}} a ground engineer who then performed a pressurization <b>leak</b> <b>check.</b> In order to carry out this check without requiring {{the aircraft}}s engines, the pressurisation system was set to [...] "manual".

50|$|Predive <b>leak</b> <b>checks</b> {{and careful}} {{assembly}} {{are the key}} to avoiding leaks through connections and detecting damage. The negative pressure test is most important for this purpose. This test requires that the breathing loop maintains a pressure slightly below ambient for a few minutes to indicate that the seals will prevent leakage into the loop.|$|R
50|$|After {{working through}} a variety of <b>leak</b> <b>check</b> procedures, the hatches were opened between the shuttle and station at 18:40 UTC, and the two crews {{exchanged}} greetings and conducted a mandatory safety briefing. After the briefing, they began the rest of the day's tasks, including moving the station's robotic arm to grapple the OBSS, and then hand it off to the shuttle's robotic arm in preparation for future activities. The official exchange of Expedition 16 crewmembers Daniel Tani and Eyharts was completed in the evening, when they exchanged their Soyuz custom made seat liners, and Tani {{became a member of the}} STS-122 crew, while Eyharts began his position as Flight Engineer for Expedition 16.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} cabin {{altitude}} warning sounded, the captain radioed the Helios operations centre and reported [...] "the take-off configuration warning on" [...] and [...] "cooling equipment normal and alternate off line". He then {{spoke to the}} ground engineer and repeatedly stated that the [...] "cooling ventilation fan lights were off". The engineer (the one who had conducted the pressurization <b>leak</b> <b>check)</b> asked [...] "Can you confirm that the pressurization panel is set to AUTO?" [...] The captain, possibly experiencing {{the onset of the}} initial effects of hypoxia, disregarded the question and instead asked in reply, [...] "Where are my equipment cooling circuit breakers?".

50|$|During the week, teams {{spent time}} resting and relaxing, while others {{prepared}} for the next race at Milwaukee. Track crews worked diligently {{to clean up the}} infield, and make it passable for Saturday. As a result of the postponement, a special 30-minute practice session was arranged on Friday May 30. Participants were held to a 120 mi/h km/h speed limit, and it served mostly as an oil <b>leak</b> <b>check</b> exercise. Some drivers, including polesitter Rick Mears, as well as Bobby Rahal, did not even participate. The five-day delay wound up being a popular choice by nearly all of the participants. It allowed them to unwind, and regroup for race day without the uncertainty that was looming over them of when the race would start.|$|E
50|$|Pre-use {{preparation}} of the rebreather includes checking of seals and post-assembly <b>leak</b> <b>checks.</b> The positive pressure test checks that the assembled unit can maintain a slight internal positive pressure for a short period, which {{is an indication that}} gas does not leak out of the loop. Inspection and replacement of soft components should detect damage before component failure.|$|R

25|$|Expedition 21 crew members, Nicole Stott, Robert Thirsk and Frank De Winne {{completed}} the final steps {{of preparing for}} HTV's release from the ISS. These steps included disconnecting the final remaining power jumper line, closing the Node-2 nadir hatch, depressurizing the vestibule & performing <b>leak</b> <b>checks,</b> removing Common Berthing Mechanism bolts and deploying latches and unberthing the HTV-1 with the Space Station Remote Manipulator System.|$|R
50|$|Landing, {{originally}} {{scheduled for}} 1:34 UTC 24 September, was postponed due to difficulties in undocking the Soyuz spacecraft from the ISS. The crew entered the Soyuz TMA-18 on 23 September {{and closed the}} main hatch at 6:35 pm EDT. Skvortsov, Kornienko and Caldwell Dyson experienced problems getting a tight seal and were forced to open the Soyuz hatch for a quick inspection. The hatch later was sealed, but Expedition 25 flight engineer Yurchikhin working inside the space station had problems confirming a tight fit with the hatch on the ISS side of the interface. After an extended <b>leak</b> <b>check,</b> flight controllers in Moscow decided the docking interface was tight and leak free. As the countdown neared for undocking, commands were sent to open hooks on the MRM2 module side of the interface. But the mechanism did not respond. It was not clear what caused the hooks not to respond, however, Yurchikhin reported finding a small gear floating from the mechanism when he removed a cover.|$|E
50|$|On flight day 10, {{the joint}} STS-132/Expedition 23 crews awoke {{to begin the}} final hours of the joint docked mission. The crews {{completed}} the final time-sensitive transfers of the mission, which included scientific research samples {{that need to be}} kept cold. Once these transfers were completed, the two crews held a joint crew news conference and took a crew photo, and later, prior to hatch closure, held a mutual farewell ceremony. After the ceremony, the hatches between Atlantis and the International Space Station were closed, and a <b>leak</b> <b>check</b> was performed to ensure all the hatches were sealed properly. The shuttle undocked from the ISS at 15:22 UTC, a little more than 2 hours after the hatches were closed. At the time of the undocking, the two spacecraft were orbiting 220 mi above the Southern Ocean southwest of Perth, Australia. The shuttle, guided by pilot Tony Antonelli, backed away from the ISS to a distance of about 400 ft, at which time Antonelli began conducting a fly-around of the space station, so that crew members on both the ISS and shuttle could get photos of both vehicles. Once the fly-around was complete, the shuttle crew conducted two separation burns to move Atlantis away from the space station.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} a method for limiting the amount of helium administered during leak testing and provide a method for keeping the atmospheric helium in a location to a minimum to eliminate backstreaming into the system. This method utilizes the permeability of a balloon. The transporting of helium to the <b>leak</b> <b>check</b> area is also safer by not requiring a cylinder in the <b>leak</b> <b>check</b> location. Utilizing the many shapes of balloons and partially filling of the balloon, any configuration can deliver helium to the leak location.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a test technique for revalidation of the Space Shuttle Orbiter Main Propulsion System during ground turnaround operations between flights of the Space Transportation System (STS). The Main Propulsion System consists of the three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME's) and the Main Propulsion System (MPS) connecting the SSME's to the orbiter/ground and orbiter/External Tank (ET) interfaces. The Helium Signature Test (HST) performs an end-to-end <b>leak</b> <b>check</b> of the MPS/SSME subsystems that serves as a final validation of those systems for reuse. The test was initially developed during the ground processing flow prior to the STS- 6 launch of orbiter Challenger. The test was developed to fulfill a requirement for an overall subsystem <b>leak</b> <b>check</b> as a result of experience gained during the STS- 6 Challenger Flight Readiness Firing (FRF) series, during which leaks were encountered in the SSME's that were not detected by routine fluid joint leak checks. The HST technique is described in detail, including orbiter and test equipment configuration, and compared to other leak detection methods used to revalidate MPS/SSME systems for reuse. The HST data base accumulated since STS- 6 is summarized and future test applications are described...|$|E

50|$|Electronic {{fly-by-wire}} {{systems can}} respond flexibly to changing aerodynamic conditions, by tailoring {{flight control surface}} movements so that aircraft response to control inputs is appropriate to flight conditions. Electronic systems require less maintenance, whereas mechanical and hydraulic systems require lubrication, tension adjustments, <b>leak</b> <b>checks,</b> fluid changes, etc. Placing circuitry between pilot and aircraft can enhance safety. For example, the control system can try to prevent a stall, or it can stop the pilot from over stressing the airframe.|$|R

40|$|The {{procedure}} is as follows: (1) Firmly bar clamp the box together in all directions. When all directions have been secured, tack weld each outside seam {{of the box}} in 4 or 5 places along it's length. Remove clamps and proceed to weld all outside seams. Care should be taken that the maximum weld cross section does not exceed 1 / 16 -inch x 1 / 16 -inch. (2) To help stabilize the metal as it cools, we will install all slot plugs, (MC- 223665), and one side cover plate, (MD- 223637). Inside welds for this side plate will be made thru the opposite side flange. Weld cross sections should be held to a 1 / 16 -inch maximum depth and width. (3) Weld {{the inside of the}} end plates, (MD- 224535), using the weld relief as filler material. After the box has cooled, weld the top plate (ME- 2244533) to the side flange, (ME- 224536) and then to the bottom plate (ME- 223534). (4) Repeat this procedure for the opposite side. (5) Helium <b>leak</b> <b>check</b> the welds, inside and out, by plugging the slot pumpout holes and pumping on the pumpout line. Remember that the clearances are very tight in the space that is to be pumpted. Allow plenty of time for a good pumpdown and <b>leak</b> <b>check.</b> Leak detection should be on the most sensitive scale on a helium leak detector with a minimum sensitivity of 10 - 9 ATM CC/SEC.
