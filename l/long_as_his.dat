5|$|Despite early victories, Pyrrhus {{found his}} {{position}} in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> army remained in Italy. Facing unacceptably heavy losses from each encounter with the Roman army, Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula. In 275 BC, Pyrrhus again met the Roman army at the Battle of Beneventum. While Beneventum was indecisive, Pyrrhus realised his army had been exhausted and reduced by years of foreign campaigns. Seeing little hope for further gains, he withdrew completely from Italy.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's {{third and}} final exile was of even shorter duration, and after two months he was reunited with Edward in England. Archbishop Winchelsey responded by excommunicating Gaveston, as the Ordinances had stipulated. Lancaster, who had by this time {{inherited}} his father-in-law Lincoln, had taken over leadership of the baronial opposition. A number of the barons set out in pursuit of Gaveston while the king left for York. Gaveston ensconced himself at Scarborough Castle, and on 19 May 1312 agreed on a surrender to Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> security would be guaranteed.|$|E

5|$|Reginald first {{appears in}} the {{historical}} record around 1138, as a witness on some of his father's charters. Reginald {{was one of the}} main administrators of his elder brother's estates up until 1147. Reginald also had his own lands that he was granted from his brother's honour in Norfolk and Sussex. While his brother was on crusade, Reginald granted the right to form a merchant guild to the inhabitants of Lewes, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> brother agreed after his return from crusade. William, the third earl, died in early 1148 while on crusade and the earldom and estates passed to William's daughter Isabel, whom King Stephen of England married to the king's second son, William. Reginald continued to serve the new earl and also began to serve the king, witnessing several royal charters. Reginald eventually became the main advisor to the new earl.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{army had}} not yet seen {{elephants}} in battle, and their inexperience turned the tide in Pyrrhus' favour at the Battle of Heraclea in 280 BC, and again at the Battle of Ausculum in 279 BC. Despite these victories, Pyrrhus found his position in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> army remained in Italy. Furthermore, Rome entered into a treaty of support with Carthage, and Pyrrhus found that despite his expectations, {{none of the other}} Italic peoples would defect to the Greek and Samnite cause. Facing unacceptably heavy losses with each encounter with the Roman army, and failing to find further allies in Italy, Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula and campaigned in Sicily against Carthage, abandoning his allies to deal with the Romans.|$|E

5|$|The {{eminence}} {{achieved by}} East Anglia under Rædwald {{did not last}} <b>long,</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> dynasty fell victim to the rising power of Penda of Mercia and his successors. Throughout the mid-seventh to early ninth centuries, Mercian power grew until a vast region from the River Thames to the Humber, including East Anglia and the south-east, became a zone of Mercian hegemony. In the early 640s Penda defeated and killed both Ecgric and Sigeberht, who was later venerated as a saint. Ecgric's successor Anna and Anna's son Jurmin were killed together in 654 at the Battle of Bulcamp, near Blythburgh. Having eliminated Anna's challenge to his rising power, Penda then subjected the East Anglians to Mercian overlord-ship. In 655 Æthelhere of East Anglia joined Penda in a campaign against Oswiu, which ended in a disastrous Mercian defeat at the Battle of the Winwaed, in which both Penda and his ally Æthelhere were killed.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E
