5|$|In 1968 John Betjeman made a {{television}} film called A Poet Goes North {{in which he}} gave his opinion on the changing architecture of Leeds. Betjeman described the constant sound of falling Victorian architecture. Betjeman also lambasted British Railways House (now City House) saying it blocked all the <b>light</b> <b>out</b> to City Square and was only a testament to money and had no architectural merit of its own. Betjeman also praised Leeds Town Hall in the film. The film, which was never broadcast at the time, was preserved by Leeds Civic Trust and has been restored by the Yorkshire Film Archive. It was screened {{as part of the}} Leeds International Film Festival in 2008.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British forces {{landed on}} the island and told the keeper's wife, Thankful Stone, that they had nothing to fear as long as they kept the light burning. Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the <b>light</b> <b>out</b> per order of the New London customs inspector. The British {{threatened}} to blow up the lighthouse, and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The light's new characteristic was a fixed light with a flash every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When the lighthouse was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. The lighthouse currently uses a VRB-25 lens. The lighthouse switched to solar power in 1988. The light's characteristic is a flash of white light every ten seconds. It continues to operate as a navigational aid to the nearby Intracoastal Waterway.|$|E
25|$|Scoop {{lights or}} scoops are {{circular}} fixtures {{that do not}} have any lenses. They have an ellipsoidal reflector {{at the back of the}} fixture that directs the <b>light</b> <b>out</b> of the fixture. Since they do not have any sort of lens system they are cheaper than other fixtures. However, the light cannot be focused at all (even PARs allow more control than scoops). Scoops are most often used to flood the stage with light from above, or to light backdrops. Scoops can have gels affixed. Occasionally they are used as work lights (see below).|$|E

Another similar game was produced by Vulcan Electronics in 1983 under the name XL-25. Tiger Toys also produced a cartridge version of <b>Lights</b> <b>Out</b> for its Game com handheld game console in 1997, shipped free with the console. A number of new puzzles similar to <b>Lights</b> <b>Out</b> have been released, such as <b>Lights</b> <b>Out</b> 2000, <b>Lights</b> <b>Out</b> Cube, and <b>Lights</b> <b>Out</b> Deluxe.|$|R
5000|$|This {{series of}} <b>Lights</b> <b>Out</b> {{differed}} from its predecessors {{in that it}} contained overt anti-Nazi messages. For instance, in Execution a Nazi commandant's efforts to kill {{the leader of a}} French resistance movement are frustrated by the continual regeneration of the leader. Most of these <b>Lights</b> <b>Out</b> broadcasts are remakes of Oboler's first <b>Lights</b> <b>Out</b> series. Almost all of these broadcasts are saved, whereas only three broadcasts remain of the earlier <b>Lights</b> <b>Out.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1962 British Railways House, now City House, {{was added}} to the railway station. It was {{designed}} by architect John Poulson providing British Railways with administrative buildings. The building became dated and hard to let before refurbishment in 2009. The building was lambasted in 1967 by poet John Betjeman who said it blocked all the <b>light</b> <b>out</b> of City Square, and was a testament to money with no architectural merit. In 2010 the building was bought by property company Bruntwood which is (as of 2017) redeveloping it to provide serviced offices, with a new look to the façade.|$|E
25|$|CCFL: The LCD {{panel is}} lit either by two cold cathode {{fluorescent}} lamps placed at opposite {{edges of the}} display or an array of parallel CCFLs behind larger displays. A diffuser then spreads the <b>light</b> <b>out</b> evenly across the whole display. For many years, this technology had been used almost exclusively. Unlike white LEDs, most CCFLs have an even-white spectral output resulting in better color gamut for the display. However, CCFLs are less energy efficient than LEDs and require a somewhat costly inverter to convert whatever DC voltage the device uses (usually 5 or 12V) to ~1000 V needed to light a CCFL. The thickness of the inverter transformers also limits how thin the display can be made.|$|E

Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the <b>light</b> <b>out</b> per order of the New London customs inspector. The British threatened to blow up the lighthouse and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 2008, the generator house for the light was renovated to be a summer house for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service interns who study the endangered roseate terns.

5000|$|<b>Lights</b> <b>Out</b> often {{featured}} metafictional humor. Perhaps {{inspired by}} Cooper's [...] "The Coffin in Studio B," [...] in which actors rehearsing {{an episode of}} <b>Lights</b> <b>Out</b> are interrupted by a mysterious coffin salesman peddling his wares, Oboler wrote stories like [...] "Murder in the Script Department," [...] in which two <b>Lights</b> <b>Out</b> script typists become trapped in their building after hours as frightening, unexplained events occur. In [...] "The Author and the Thing," [...] Oboler even plays himself pitted against {{one of his own}} monstrous creations.|$|R
500|$|One rather complex {{task that}} falls to STScI is {{scheduling}} observations for the telescope. Hubble is in a low-Earth orbit to enable servicing missions, but {{this means that}} most astronomical targets are occulted by the Earth for slightly {{less than half of}} each orbit. Observations cannot take place when the telescope passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly due to elevated radiation levels, and there are also sizable exclusion zones around the Sun (precluding observations of Mercury), Moon and Earth. The solar avoidance angle is about 50°, to keep sunlight from illuminating any part of the OTA. Earth and Moon avoidance keeps bright <b>light</b> <b>out</b> of the FGSs, and keeps scattered light from entering the instruments. If the FGSs are turned off, however, the Moon and Earth can be observed. Earth observations were used very early in the program to generate flat-fields for the WFPC1 instrument. There is a so-called continuous viewing zone (CVZ), at roughly 90° to the plane of Hubble's orbit, in which targets are not occulted for long periods. Due to the precession of the orbit, the location of the CVZ moves slowly over a period of eight weeks. Because the [...] of the Earth is always within about 30° of regions within the CVZ, the brightness of scattered earthshine may be elevated for long periods during CVZ observations.|$|E
2500|$|In a BBC film made in 1968 but not {{broadcast}} at that time, Betjeman {{described the}} sound of Leeds to be of [...] "Victorian buildings crashing to the ground". He went on to lambast John Poulson's British Railways House (now City House), saying how it blocked all the <b>light</b> <b>out</b> to City Square and was only a testament to money with no architectural merit. He also praised the architecture of Leeds Town Hall. In 1969 Betjeman contributed the foreword to Derek Linstrum's Historic Architecture of Leeds.|$|E

2500|$|The Source Four is {{the first}} ERS to use a faceted {{borosilicate}} reflector behind the lamp. [...] Nearly all stage lights {{have some form of}} reflector positioned behind the lamp to reflect otherwise wasted <b>light</b> <b>out</b> of the front of the instrument. [...] The Source Four's reflector is dichroic, meaning that it reflects light of only certain wavelengths. [...] The Source Four's reflector reflects back 95% of the visible light striking it, while allowing over 90% of the infrared radiation (heat) to pass out the back of the instrument. This produces a much cooler light which is less destructive to gobos or color gels {{at the front of the}} fixture, and reduces localized heating of the lighting target.|$|E

2500|$|The {{radar picture}} of a raster-scan {{synthetic}} display is produced on a television screen and {{is made up of}} a large number of horizontal lines which form a pattern known as a raster. This type of display is much more complex than the radial-scan synthetic display and requires a large amount of memory. [...] There are a number of advantages for the operator of a raster-scan display and concurrently there are some deficiencies too. The most obvious advantage of a raster-scan display is the brightness of the picture. This allows the observer to view the screen in almost all conditions of ambient <b>light.</b> <b>Out</b> of all the benefits offered by a raster-scan radar it is this ability which has assured its success.

2500|$|The driver {{consists}} {{of a number of}} [...] "beamlines" [...] containing [...] amplifiers {{at one end of the}} building. Just prior to firing, the glass is [...] "pumped" [...] to a high-energy state with a series of xenon flash tubes, causing a population inversion of the neodymium (Nd) atoms in the glass. This readies them for amplification via stimulated emission when a small amount of laser light, generated externally in a fibre optic, is fed into the beamlines. The glass is not particularly effective at transferring power into the beam, so to get as much power as possible back out the beam is reflected through the glass four times in a mirrored cavity, each time gaining more power. When this process is complete, a Pockels cell [...] "switches" [...] the <b>light</b> <b>out</b> of the cavity. One problem for the HiPER project is that Nd:glass is no longer being produced commercially, so a number of options need to be studied to ensure supply of the estimated 1,300 disks.|$|E
