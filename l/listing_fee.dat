5000|$|Timeshare {{donation}} is {{a consumer}} relief strategy that allows timeshare owners a legitimate {{way out of}} their timeshare ownership. The concept of timeshare donation is less than ten years old, but gains popularity each year as the timeshare resale market continues to falter. In recent years, due to a severely depressed timeshare resale market owners looking to sell their timeshare have little success. Timeshare owners also face a myriad of unscrupulous timeshare listing companies looking for large up-front fees with the promise that their timeshare will soon be out of their name. [...] Typically the listing company cannot sell their timeshare, nor do they have an incentive because they can collect another <b>listing</b> <b>fee</b> after the original listing contract expires. For many timeshare owners, trying to sell their timeshare becomes a vicious cycle of broken promises, high fees, and little to no interest from buyers. According to the Florida Attorney General’s Office, timeshare owners are also especially vulnerable to timeshare resale scams. Ultimately, many owners look to simply give-away, or donate their timeshare to a willing party because their timeshare investment has become a liability.|$|E

Second, at the website with high cost incurred, subjects could choose a median starting-price strategy, seeking a higher payoff. Third, subjects did not show strong preference to choose a high starting-price strategy at the website with no cost incurred. 1...|$|E
