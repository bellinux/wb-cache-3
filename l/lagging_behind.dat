5|$|As an {{industrial}} port city, Haifa {{has traditionally been}} a Labor party stronghold. The strong presence of dock workers and trade unions earned it the nickname 'Red Haifa.' In addition, many prominent Arabs in the Israeli Communist Party, among them Tawfik Toubi, Emile Habibi, Zahi Karkabi, Bulus Farah and Emile Toma, were from Haifa. In recent years, {{there has been a}} drift toward the center. This was best signified by, in the 2006 legislative elections, the Kadima party receiving about 28.9% of the votes in Haifa, and Labor <b>lagging</b> <b>behind</b> with 16.9%.|$|E

5|$|Both {{males and}} females can defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more {{powerful}} build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride. Those <b>lagging</b> <b>behind</b> may provide other valuable services to the group. An alternative hypothesis {{is that there is}} some reward associated with being a leader who fends off intruders, and the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship to the pride from outside males who attempt to take over their relationship with the pride.|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} education program at Vassar College {{in the town of}} Poughkeepsie, New York, was the first such program in the United States. Its facilities were first housed within the school's Calisthenium and Riding Academy which opened in 1866, a year after Vassar's opening in 1865. Alumna Forence Cushing, along with a cohort of other Boston-based alumnae, observed in 1883 that Vassar's {{physical education}} program was <b>lagging</b> <b>behind</b> those at other recently opened Seven Sisters schools including Wellesley College and Smith College. The New York and Boston alumnae clubs began an attempt to raise $20,000, which they believed to be an adequate sum to pay for a new home for athletics at the school.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{reform to}} Western Australia's prison system – new prisons, legislation, and {{administration}} – {{did not begin}} until the 1960s, <b>lagging</b> <b>behind</b> those that occurred in Europe, North America, and elsewhere in Australia after World War II. Seven new prisons were opened between 1960 and 1971, including a maximum-security facility at Albany, following an abrupt increase in the prisoner population in the mid- to late-1950s. In 1970, female prisoners and staff were moved from Fremantle to the new Bandyup Women's Prison, built at Bandyup {{on the outskirts of}} Perth. The female division, which had been the only women's prison in Western Australia, was subsequently used for male prisoners. New legislation regarding probation, parole, and convicted drunkards was also introduced, which provided alternatives to imprisonment. With these new arrangements, and more variety in prisons and prison types, a classification board was set up in 1963 to assess prisoners.|$|E

5|$|In early March 1998, a {{military}} court convicted Ranariddh guilty of smuggling weapons and causing instability to the country, sentencing {{him to a}} total of 35 years of imprisonment. After ASEAN and the European Union stepped in to condemn the sentences, Ranariddh was pardoned of all charges, allowing him to return to Cambodia on 30 March 1998 to prepare for the general elections scheduled to be held in July 1998, allowing Ranariddh to spearhead FUNCINPEC's election campaign. When campaigning for started in late June 1998, FUNCINPEC focused on pro-monarchial sentiments, improving living standards and anti-Vietnamese rhetoric. However, the party faced numerous obstacles, including loss of access to television and radio channels which had come under CPP's exclusive control following the 1997 clashes, and the difficulties of its supporters in getting to party rallies. When the results were announced on 5 August 1998, FUNCINPEC secured 31.7% of all valid votes, which translates to 43 seats in the National Assembly, <b>lagging</b> <b>behind</b> the CPP which polled 41.4% of the votes and secured 64 seats.|$|E
5|$|The Zarubintsy culture circle, in {{existence}} roughly from 200 BC to 150 AD, extended along {{the middle and}} upper Dnieper and its tributary the Pripyat River, but also left traces of settlements in parts of Polesie and the upper Bug River basin. The main distinguished local groups were the Polesie group, the Middle Dnieper group and the Upper Dnieper group. The Zarubintsy culture developed from the Milograd culture {{in the northern part of}} its range and from the local Scythian populations in the more southern part. The Polesie group's origin was also influenced by the Pomeranian and Jastorf cultures. The Zarubintsy culture and its beginnings were moderately affected by La Tène culture and the Black Sea area (trade with the Greek cities provided imported items) centers of civilization in the earlier stages, but not much by Roman influence later on, and accordingly its economic development was <b>lagging</b> <b>behind</b> that of other early Roman period cultures.
