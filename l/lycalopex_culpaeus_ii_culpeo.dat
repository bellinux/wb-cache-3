5000|$|Culpeo or Andean Fox (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus)</b> - {{similar to}} the red fox, the culpeo is the second largest canid of the {{continent}} (Least concern) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 120 bird {{species have been}} {{recorded}} in the reserve.Leopardus colocolo, Galictis cuja, Conepatus chinga, <b>Lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus</b> and <b>Lycalopex</b> griseus are mammal species {{that can be found}} here.|$|R
50|$|The fauna {{is similar}} to that of the Central Andean dry puna and the Patagonian steppe. Large mammals found here include the puma (Puma concolor), the Andean fox (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus)</b> and the vicuna (Vicugna vicugna) and guanaco (Lama guanicoe).|$|R
50|$|The Fuegian dog (perro yagán, perro fueguino), {{also known}} as the Yaghan dog, is an extinct domesticated canid. It was a domesticated form of the culpeo, <b>Lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus,</b> unlike other domesticated canids - dogs, domesticated from the gray wolf Canis lupus, and the domesticated fox, from the red fox Vulpes vulpes.|$|R
50|$|The fauna of the Andean Patagonian forest {{region is}} very varied with many endemic species. Predatory mammals include the cougar (Felis concolor), the culpeo (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus),</b> the {{southern}} river otter (Lontra provocax) and the Geoffroy's cat (Leopardus geoffroyi). Other mammals include Humboldt's hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus humboldtii), the Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum), the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the south Andean deer (Hippocamelus bisulcus) and numerous species of rodents.|$|R
50|$|The culpeo (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus),</b> {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the zorro culpeo or Andean fox (wolf), is a South American fox species. It is the second largest native canid on the continent, after the maned wolf. In appearance, it bears many similarities to the widely recognized red fox. It has grey and reddish fur, a white chin, reddish legs, and a stripe on its back that may be barely visible.|$|R
50|$|It is preyed {{on by the}} Andean {{mountain}} cat (Leopardus jacobitus), the colocolo (Leopardus colocolo), and the culpeo (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus)</b> in high-altitude desert regions. The northern viscacha is more often found on larger, steeper portions of cliffs. This preference is probably driven by a need to avoid predators, as land-based carnivores are more easily evaded on a steep slope. It rarely ventures far from rocks, as these provide a means of escaping from both aerial and terrestrial predators.|$|R
50|$|Mammals {{found in}} the park include the Culpeo or Andean fox (<b>lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus),</b> the South American gray fox (lycalopex griseus), {{also known as the}} Patagonian fox, the marine otter (lontra felina), known locally as chungungo, the South American sea lion, the {{southern}} elephant seals, the leopard seal (hydrurga leptonyx), the Chilean dolphin (cephalorhynchus eutropia, also known as the black dolphin or tonina), the Burmeister's porpoise (phocoena spinipinnis), Peale's dolphin (lagenorhynchus australis), the humpback whale (megaptera novaeangliae), and the guanaco (lama guanicoe).|$|R
5|$|Fauna is {{similarly}} distributed, with distinct altitudinal zonation present. The highest altitudes support the endangered mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), cougar (Puma concolor), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), and Andean fox (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus).</b> Lower down, the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), brocket deers (Mazama sp.), vulnerable northern pudú (Pudu mephistophiles), and endangered giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) {{can all be}} found. Bird species common in the area include the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus), giant hummingbird (Patagona gigas), torrent duck (Merganetta armata), king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), and swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus).|$|R
50|$|Over 70 {{animal species}} have been {{documented}} on the reserve. Common bird species include the Andean condor Vultur gryphus, Darwin's rhea Rhea pennata, and flamingo. Reptiles include venomous snakes such as the Patagonian pit viper Bothrops ammodytoides and crossed pit viper Bothrops alternatus. Predators include the mountain lion Puma concolor, South American gray fox Pseudalopex griseus, culpeo fox <b>Lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus</b> and pampas cat Leopardus pajeros. Other mammals include a large rodent, the plains viscacha Lagostomus maximus, and the largest native animal on the reserve, the guanaco Lama guanicoe. A cooperative of around 20 families, Cooperativa Payun Matru, live on the reserve. They round up the wild guanaco every year and shear the animals for their fur. The annual round up is monitored by the Wildlife Conservation Society, and wool and yarn are exported abroad.|$|R
40|$|Goat {{husbandry}} is {{the main}} rural livelihood in the northern Patagonian steppe of Argentina, and herders kill any carnivore that they believe threatens their herds, including the endangered Andean cat (Leopardus jacobita). We evaluated the use of local, mediumsized, mixed-breed guarding dogs to reduce predation and retaliatory killing of carnivores. We interviewed 64 herders, and delivered 37 puppies to 25 herders. Most economic loss was attributed to cougars (Puma concolor) and culpeos (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus).</b> All herders with dogs that reached the working stage reported reduced rates of predation, and 88 % reported {{that they no longer}} kill carnivores. Among herders who were not using dogs, 89 % of them reported increased predation, and 100 % of them confirmed that they kill carnivores. Mixedbreed dogs can be effective in reducing both predation losses and retaliatory killing, but their success depends on the ability and willingness of herders to train and use them properly...|$|R
40|$|Ontogenetic {{changes in}} the skull of <b>Lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus</b> were studied in {{relation}} to feeding function and performance at different age classes. Most cranial changes occurred in the orbitotemporal region and consisted of the visible appearance of structures that were later found to be absent in juveniles. These changes {{were related to the}} development of the adult skull in order to capture, kill, and process prey. In general, fusion occurred earlier in neurocranial sutures than in the splachnocranium, although rostral sutures never became fused. The cranial sutures of culpeo are conservative, displaying few changes in suture type but some in suture fusion sequence. These modifications occur during the first year, from the late juvenile stages, when individuals are similar to adults in general appearance and body size as well as in skull size. However, it was noted that basicranial synchondroses became fused in the adult stages, indicating that longitudinal growth could extend until this latter time. This could be indicative not only of size change in adult specimens but also of shape change. Fil: Segura Gago, Alda Valentina. Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas.

40|$|The {{identification}} of the H 3 K 4 trimethylase, PRDM 9, as the gene responsible for recombination hotspot localization has provided considerable insight into the mechanisms by which recombination is initiated in mammals. However, uniquely amongst mammals, canids appear to lack a functional version of PRDM 9 and may therefore provide a model for understanding recombination that occurs {{in the absence of}} PRDM 9, and thus how PRDM 9 functions to shape the recombination landscape. We have constructed a fine-scale genetic map from patterns of linkage disequilibrium assessed using high-throughput sequence data from 51 free-ranging dogs, Canis lupus familiaris. While broad-scale properties of recombination appear similar to other mammalian species, our fine-scale estimates indicate that canine highly elevated recombination rates are observed in the vicinity of CpG rich regions including gene promoter regions, but show little association with H 3 K 4 trimethylation marks identified in spermatocytes. By comparison to genomic data from the Andean fox, <b>Lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus,</b> we show that biased gene conversion is a plausible mechanism by which the high CpG content of the dog genome could have occurred.

40|$|The Andean fox <b>Lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus</b> (Molina, 1782) {{has been}} {{included}} in the category of threat Vulnerable in Colombia, however, there are not available studies that support at the national level the inclusion of this species in that category. In this work, we delimited the distribution area and we discuss the category of threat of the species in Colombia. For this, we used a niche modelling approach using the Maximun Entropy (Maxent) algorithm. Using Geographical Information Systems, we highlighted areas in which the species is protected. Our results show that the Andean fox can be found potentially from Nariño until Huila departments (8, 877 km), and the National System of Protected Areas in Colombia protected 1, 742 km (19. 6 %) of the potential distribution of the species. Despite the species is considered Vulnerable in Colombia, we found that it does not meet the criteria for allocation in that category, due to the absence of tangible evidence that supported a population decline, decreased in area of occupancy, or habitat quality in the decade prior to the risk assessment. Considering the validated records and information on the distribution area of the species in Colombia, we suggest a re-assignation of the category to the category Near Threatened (NT) ...|$|R
40|$|Species {{morphological}} {{changes can}} be mutually influenced by environmental or biotic factors, such as competition. South American canids represent a quite recent radiation of taxa that evolved forms very disparate in phenotype, ecology and behaviour. Today, in {{the central part of}} South America there is one dominant large species (the maned wolf, Chrysocyon brachyurus) that directly influence sympatric smaller taxa via interspecific killing. Further south, three species of similar sized foxes (Lycalopex spp.) share the same habitats. Such unique combination of taxa and geographic distribution makes South American dogs an ideal group to test for the simultaneous impact of climate and competition on phenotypic variation. Using geometric morphometrics, we quantified skull size and shape of 431 specimens belonging to the eight extant South American canid species: Atelocynus microtis, Cerdocyon thous, Ch. brachyurus, <b>Lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus,</b> L. griseus, L. gymnocercus, L. vetulus and Speothos venaticus. South American canids are significantly different in both skull size and shape. The hypercarnivorous bush dog is mostly distinct in shape from all the other taxa while a degree of overlap in shape—but not size—occurs between species of the genus Lycalopex. Both climate and competition impacts interspecific morphological variation. We identified climatic adaptations as the main driving force of diversification for the South American canids. Competition has a lower degree of impact on their skull morphology although it might {{have played a role in}} the past, when canid community was richer in morphotypes...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} annual and {{seasonal}} food habits of sympatric grey fox (Lycalopex griseus) and culpeo fox (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus)</b> in a protected area, in southeastern Argentine Patagonia, {{to test the}} hypothesis that both foxes partition prey. Grey foxes consumed a larger proportion of rodents than culpeos (66. 1 % versus 37. % of occurrences in feces, respectively), and culpeos consumed a larger proportion of the introduced European hare (Lepus europaeus) (32. 8 % versus 7. 1 %, respectively). Additionally, arthropods made up {{a significant portion of the}} diet of the grey fox, and occurred in the 95. 5 % of the analyzed feces. Despite the great differences in size of culpeo and grey foxes, the former being significantly larger, both species consumed the same type of prey, and no significant differences in the mean weight of vertebrate prey were detected in their diets. Culpeo and grey foxes diets differed during spring – summer with low values of mean diet overlap (31 %). But in autumn – winter, when prey diversity is lower in Patagonia, diet was more similar and diet overlap (73 %) increased. An exploratory analysis of habitat use by culpeo and grey foxes suggested that both species utilize habitat in a similar way. Our data agree with generalizations about competitive interactions between the large and the small canid in an assemblage. Although both foxes can potentially consume the same type of prey, through interference the larger culpeo would exclude the smaller grey fox from habitats with high-quality prey, resulting in prey partitioning. The possibility that both foxes partition habitat at a finer scale in our study area should be explored. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{details for}} the first time the food habits of the culpeo or Andean fox (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>culpaeus)</b> in high areas of the Ecuadorian Andes during a {{complete}} annual cycle. Our objective was to identify prey species, calculate their contribution to diet and test for temporal variation. In total, 304 Andean fox scats were collected within the Podocarpus National Park (Loja province, southern Ecuador). By analysing the content of scats 413 prey items were identified and classified into eight prey groups. Subsequently, the frequency of occurrence (FO) for each prey group was calculated per month together with the relative contribution of estimated consumed biomass (CB). In addition, the Shannon-Wiener’s index was calculated as a measurement of monthly diet diversity. The results show a diet dominated by cervids belonging to the Mazama and Pudu genus (70 % FO), followed by small mammals (30 % FO), large rodents (12 % FO), carnivorous species (10 % FO) and lagomorphs (8 % FO). There was temporal variation in the consumption of both deer and small mammals. Cervids also provided the major part of the consumed biomass (70 % CB), the remaining prey categories each accounted for less than 11 % CB. Negative correlations in consumption were observed between cervids and two other groups, rabbits and small mammals. Trophic diversity values fluctuated throughout the year showing a mean of 1. 7. The results obtained show a diets very different from those previously reported; deer being the bulk of the diet instead of rodents or other mammals. The consumption of carnivorous species in the area was also high in comparison with other regions. Overall, this study clearly demonstrates that the culpeo is an important top predator in the high-Andean ecosystem...|$|R
