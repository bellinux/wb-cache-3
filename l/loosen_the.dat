The mud was placed behind these, and in trenches to seal the works from water, using special side-tipping wagons.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{normally}} nest in crevices between {{or under}} rocks, or burrow in the soil. When {{they make their}} own tunnels, they <b>loosen</b> <b>the</b> earth with their bills and kick out the debris with their feet. The birds less commonly nest in walls, under buildings or down rabbit burrows. Disused or occupied burrows of Atlantic puffins and Manx shearwaters are sometimes used, and the petrel pair may share a common entrance with those seabirds, rabbits or other pairs of its own species. Where other occupants are present, the petrels dig a side burrow or use an existing low-roofed tunnel which the larger birds or rabbits cannot easily enter. Even so, puffins and shearwaters will sometimes access and destroy nests, and adult petrels may be killed by their larger neighbours. Human-made plastic nesting tubes are readily used, and may provide protection against predators. Birds usually mate for life and use the same hole every year.|$|E

25|$|Cataract {{surgery was}} known to the {{physician}} Sushruta (6th century BCE). Traditional cataract surgery was performed with a special tool called the Jabamukhi Salaka, a curved needle used to <b>loosen</b> <b>the</b> lens and push the cataract {{out of the field}} of vision. The eye would later be soaked with warm butter and then bandaged. Though this method was successful, Susruta cautioned that it should only be used when necessary. The removal of cataract by surgery was also introduced into China from India.|$|E
25|$|The Tattie scone is {{a popular}} Scottish dish {{containing}} potatoes. Colcannon is a traditional Irish food made with mashed potato, shredded kale or cabbage, and onion; champ is a similar dish. Boxty pancakes are eaten throughout Ireland, although associated especially with the north, and in Irish diaspora communities; they are traditionally made with grated potatoes, soaked to <b>loosen</b> <b>the</b> starch and mixed with flour, buttermilk and baking powder. A variant eaten and sold in Lancashire, especially Liverpool, is made with cooked and mashed potatoes.|$|E

In this configuration, precession may <b>loosen</b> <b>the</b> pedals over time, causing the pedals to become detached and/or damaging the pedal threading in the crank arms. A front crankset designed for tandem use is a commercially available option, since this has a chainring for the timing chain on the left side, though choice of chainring sizes may be limited.|$|E

25|$|Most uppers have a mechanism, such as laces, straps with buckles, zippers, elastic, velcro straps, buttons, or snaps, for {{tightening}} the upper on the foot. Uppers with laces {{usually have a}} tongue that helps seal the laced opening and protect the foot from abrasion by the laces. Uppers with laces also have eyelets or hooks {{to make it easier}} to tighten and <b>loosen</b> <b>the</b> laces and to prevent the lace from tearing through the upper material. An aglet is the protective wrapping on the end of the lace.|$|E
25|$|Rubber cements are {{solutions}} {{of synthetic}} or natural rubber products in solvents, {{with or without}} resins and gums. Vulcanizers, accelerators, and stabilizers are considered problematic {{due to the nature}} of their compounds. One example is the additive of sulfur which is harmful to some types of material, including silver, because it can cause discoloration. Rubber adhesives can be confused with epoxy resins due to their similar appearance. However, unlike epoxy resins, rubber adhesives will stretch when pulled. Nitromors or Polystrippa solvent brands are used as a solvent but warm water can also <b>loosen</b> <b>the</b> bond.|$|E
25|$|Loosening load-in rules: The load-in period {{may last}} several weeks and cost $1 million or more. Current work rules require {{producers}} to determine ahead of time how many stagehands are needed on each given day. These numbers cannot change once load-in begins, requiring producers to pay salaries even if no work occurs. The rule ensures that workers will not be on call (and unpaid for it) during the load-in period. The producers proposed essentially eliminating the rule. The union agreed to <b>loosen</b> <b>the</b> rule, but sought to keep a minimum number of stagehands at work each day.|$|E

He did not stop for the Union soldiers to catch up but continued all the way back to Alexandria. Schenck now had no means of communication and had to have the wounded men carried back to their camp in blankets by soldiers on foot. The regiment's medical supplies and instruments had been left on the train.|$|E
25|$|During {{cooking and}} soaking, {{a number of}} {{chemical}} changes {{take place in the}} grains of maize. Because plant cell wall components, including hemicellulose and pectin, are highly soluble in alkaline solutions, the kernels soften and their pericarps (hulls) <b>loosen.</b> <b>The</b> grain hydrates and absorbs calcium or potassium (depending on the alkali used) from the cooking solution. Starches swell and gelatinize, and some starches disperse into the liquid. Certain chemicals from the germ are released that allow the cooked grains to be ground more easily, yet make dough made from the grains less likely to tear and break down. Cooking changes the grain's protein matrix, which makes proteins and nutrients from the endosperm of the kernel more available to the human body.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Yugoslav {{president}} Josip Broz Tito in 1980, underlying political, ethnic, religious, and economic tensions within Yugoslavia surfaced. In 1989 Slobodan Milošević, Chairman of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Serbia since 1986, became president of Serbia, {{the largest and most}} populous of the six Yugoslav republics. As Milošević moved to consolidate power by centralizing the state, the governments of the other republics sought to <b>loosen</b> <b>the</b> central grip on power by devolving as much constitutional power as possible to each of the republics and autonomous provinces. A series of disagreements among delegates persisted until four of the six republics each made the decision to secede from Yugoslavia. Supported by Germany and the Vatican, Slovenia was among those republics aiming for independence.|$|E

She attacks him, accuses him of planning to leave her, mounts him, and then smashes a large block of wood onto his testicles, causing him to lose consciousness. The woman then performs a sex act on the unconscious man, culminating in an ejaculation of blood. She drills a hole through his leg, bolting a heavy grindstone through the wound, and then tossing the wrench she used under the cabin. He awakens alone; unable to <b>loosen</b> <b>the</b> bolt, he hides by dragging himself into the deep, dark foxhole {{at the base of the}} dead tree.

25|$|It {{took him}} {{four years to}} reach the second highest jūryō {{division}} in March 1983, aged 19, {{the same time as}} fellow Tokachi district rival Ōnokuni entered the top division. By this time his stablemate Chiyonofuji had been promoted to yokozuna. Hokutoumi made his debut in the top makuuchi division in September 1983. In March 1986 at sekiwake rank he won his first yūshō or tournament title with a record of thirteen wins and two losses. Despite this impressive result he was not immediately promoted to the second highest ōzeki rank as he had not done particularly well in the previous two tournaments, only managing 30 wins in the most recent three tournaments when 33 is generally required. It also did not help his cause that there were already five ōzeki, leaving the Sumo Association with no incentive to <b>loosen</b> <b>the</b> promotion criteria. However, he carried on producing excellent results with an 11–4 in May, and then went 12–3 in July, securing his promotion for the September tournament.
