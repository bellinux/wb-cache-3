40|$|Abstract — With {{this paper}} we present {{algorithms}} to {{generate and test}} DNA code words that avoid unwanted cross hybridizations. Methods from the theory <b>of</b> <b>codes</b> based on formal languages are employed. These algorithms are implemented in user-friendly software, CODEGEN, which contains a collection of language-theoretic objects adaptable to various related tasks. <b>Lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>code</b> words may be stored, viewed, altered and retested. Implemented in Visual Basic 6. 0, its interface allows for <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>code</b> words to be assembled at varying levels of acceptability from a single main window...|$|R

50|$|Over time, new {{currencies}} {{are created}} and old currencies are discontinued. Frequently, {{these changes are}} due {{to the formation of}} new governments, treaties between countries standardizing on a shared currency, or revaluation of an existing currency due to excessive inflation. As a result, the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>codes</b> must be updated from time to time. The ISO 4217 maintenance agency (MA), SIX Interbank Clearing, is responsible for maintaining the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In some cases, the {{evaluation}} may be augmented to include assurance requirements beyond the minimum {{required for a}} particular EAL. Officially this is indicated by following the EAL number with the word augmented and usually with a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>codes</b> to indicate the additional requirements. As shorthand, vendors will often simply add a [...] "plus" [...] sign (as in EAL4+) to indicate the augmented requirements.|$|E
50|$|This page lists {{articles}} {{related to}} probability theory. In particular, it lists many articles corresponding to specific probability distributions. Such articles are marked here by {{a code of}} the form (X:Y), which refers to number of random variables involved {{and the type of}} the distribution. For example (2:DC) indicates a distribution with two random variables, discrete or continuous. Other codes are just abbreviations for topics.

50|$|An EPPO code, {{formerly}} known as a Bayer code, is an encoded identifier {{that is used by}} the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO), in a system designed to uniquely identify organisms - namely plants, pests and pathogens - that are important to agriculture and crop protection. EPPO codes are a core component of a database of names, both scientific and vernacular. Although originally started by the Bayer Corporation, the official <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>codes</b> is now maintained by EPPO.|$|E
50|$|A {{frequent}} {{criticism of}} coding method by individuals from other research tracks {{is that it}} seeks to transform qualitative data into empirically valid data, which contain: actual value range, structural proportion, contrast ratios, and scientific objective properties; thereby draining the data of its variety, richness, and individual character. Analysts respond to this criticism by thoroughly expositing their definitions of codes and linking those codes soundly to the underlying data, therein bringing {{back some of the}} richness that might be absent from a mere <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Gold Codes are {{generated}} daily and {{provided by the}} National Security Agency (NSA) to the White House, The Pentagon, United States Strategic Command, and TACAMO. For an extra level of security, the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>codes</b> on the card includes codes that have no meaning, and therefore the president must memorize where on the list the correct code is located. The concept behind the codes is that they permit the president to positively identify himself as the commander-in-chief and thereby authenticate a launch order to the National Military Command Center (NMCC).|$|E

50|$|The first system, {{introduced}} in 1900, {{consisted of a}} letter code denoting the province the vehicle was registered in (the full <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>codes</b> appears below), followed by a sequence number of up to six digits (XXX-NNNNNN). The codes were normally {{made up of the}} first one or two letters of the province name or the name of the provincial capital (many provinces are named after their capitals), under the provisions of a 1926 regulation. In the earliest days, some provinces used three-letter codes, but these were abolished after 1926.|$|E
50|$|In the past, pull {{stations}} {{controlled the}} entire system. These coded pull stations were {{much bigger than}} modern pulls and had a code wheel in them. They had a gear mechanism that was wound up when the station was pulled, and (unlike modern pull stations) the handle did not stay down. The gears would turn a small wheel with a specific number of teeth, which determined the coding. The teeth would push up on a contact, which would open and close a circuit, pulsing the code to the bells or horns. This code was used by building security to determine where the alarm was originating from. For example, consider a pull station in the fourth floor elevator lobby of an office building with a code of 5-3-1. When the station was pulled, the security officers in the building would look up 5-3-1 in a master <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>codes.</b> After finding {{the location of the}} pull, they would check {{to see if there is}} a real fire. If there was, they would evacuate the building and call the fire department.|$|E

Thus structured, the start-up <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>codes</b> was used to code {{the rest of the}} interviews. Each interview transcript was analysed line by line with the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>codes.</b> A code was applied if it reflected a concept in a paragraph, i.e., microanalysis [34].|$|E
