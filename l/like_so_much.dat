5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> else, {{this is hard}} to say, but {{the balance}} of historians' judgements is that there {{may well have been}} bishops based in Llanbadarn for a period, or even periods, in Celtic times. Church {{organisation}} in early medieval (pre-1100) Wales was flexible, and there were no fixed dioceses. The claim in Padarn's Life that he was bishop of Ceredigion reflects a tradition, but the actual area of the saint's influence was in north Ceredigion and what is now Radnorshire (mid-Powys). Ceredigion south of the river Wyre was David country. Some time after this the church is said to have lost its episcopal privileges. The church is thought to have been annexed, after the dissolution of the see, to that of St David's; although as with much of the early history this is uncertain. Bishops at this time were, in Wales, rather more itinerant than they later became, and diocesan boundaries much more fluid than they were later. Gerald of Wales (Gerald de Barri, better known as Giraldus Cambrensis), reported that he had been told that the bishopric had been lost because at some time past Llanbadarn's bishop had been murdered and the church lands appropriated by his killers, the forerunners of the clas which held the church {{at the time of his}} visit in 1188.|$|E

25|$|The Church {{has long}} been {{concerned}} about the continued illegal practice of polygamy, and, in particular, about reports of child and wife abuse emanating from polygamous communities today. It will be regrettable if this program, by making polygamy the subject of entertainment, minimizes {{the seriousness of the}} problem. Placing the series in Salt Lake City, the international headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is enough to blur the line between the modern Church and the program's subject matter, and to reinforce old and long-outdated stereotypes. Big Love, <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> other television programming, is essentially lazy and indulgent entertainment that does nothing for our society and will never nourish great minds.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, Levine {{appeared}} as a recurring character in the [...] of the television series American Horror Story. He plays Leo Morrison, a newly-wed photographer visiting modern-day Briarcliff Manor, an insane asylum, on honeymoon with wife Teresa, played by Jenna Dewan Tatum. The scenes were shot around his summer touring schedule. In an interview with E!, {{he said of his}} role: [...] "It sounded <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun and that's why I wanted to do it ... this sounds, like, hysterical, funny, dark and cool and right up my alley". However, he admitted to not being a fan of the show nor horror genre in general, stating he didn't watch the episodes because [...] "it's just so weird and disturbing".|$|E
500|$|As a young teenager, Tatiana was {{assigned}} a regiment of soldiers, the Vosnesensky (Ascenscion) Hussars and given the rank of honorary colonel. She and Olga, who was also given her own regiment, {{would go out and}} inspect the soldiers regularly, an occasion they greatly enjoyed. When she was nearly fourteen, an ill Tatiana begged her mother to permit her {{to get out of bed}} in time to go to a review so she could watch a soldier she was infatuated with. [...] "I would <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to go the review of the second division as I am also the second daughter and Olga was at the first so now it is my turn," [...] she wrote to Alexandra on 20 April 1911.

500|$|This {{brought the}} {{regiment}} into contact {{for the first}} time with someone it would later meet more seriously, Brigadier Bernard Law Montgomery (often referred to as [...] "Monty"), then commanding the 9th Infantry Brigade in Portsmouth. In 1937, the brigade was on an exercise in Wiltshire and RWY was attached to it for their two-week annual camp. The brigade major wrote that [...] " [...] was run <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of the TA those days on rather feudal lines...when they heard they were going to have those tremendous exercises – three nights out at a time – they jibbed violently....Most of them had looked forward to exercises all day and then going out for a bit of jollity at night." [...] The upshot was that the regiment was banished to a distant part of the camp where their socialising would not be disturbed by the Regulars. However, apparently the Yeomanry were so intrigued by Monty's exercises that their Commanding Officer (CO) approached him, asking to be included in the last brigade exercise.|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, [...] "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] {{was both}} a {{commercial}} and critical disappointment despite Disney's efforts; the song has been met with generally negative reviews from music critics, who dismissed it as standard and uninspired. Jerry McCulley of Amazon.com described [...] "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] as [...] "a serviceable slice of modern R boilerplate". Although AllMusic's Jonathan Widran believed that the song could potentially become a [...] "pop hit", he ultimately dismissed it as [...] "fairly generic Diane Warren-written fare." [...] In Billboard, radio personality Charles Karel Bouley agreed that the song is [...] "average pop fare" [...] while acknowledging its Top 40 potential. Film Score Monthlys Lukas Kendall strongly disliked the ballad, writing, [...] "The less said about...'Where the Dream Takes You,' the better." [...] James Barry of Soundtrack.net wrote, [...] "If I had to pick something to dislike, it'd be the song 'Where the Dream Takes You'" [...] because [...] "it suffers from sounding <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> other disposable end-credits music." [...] Telenet's Thomas Glorieux opined that the song [...] "fails to even stir up the attention because I find it a very ordinary song." ...|$|E
500|$|The nudity was {{optional}} for the performers. The French cast was [...] "the nudest" [...] of {{the foreign}} groups, while the London cast [...] "found nudity the hardest to achieve." [...] The Swedish cast was reluctant to disrobe, but in Copenhagen, the tribe thought the nudity too tame and decided to walk naked {{up and down the}} aisle during the show's prelude. In some early performances, the Germans played their scene behind a big sheet labeled [...] "CENSORED". Original Broadway cast member Natalie Mosco said, [...] "I was dead set against the nude scene at first, but I remembered my acting teacher having said that part of acting is being private in public. So I did it." [...] According to Melba Moore, [...] "It doesn't mean anything except what you want it to mean. We put so much value on clothing. .... It's <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> else people get uptight about." [...] Donna Summer, who was in the German production, said that [...] "it was not meant to be sexual. ... We stood naked to comment on the fact that society makes more of nudity than killing." [...] Rado said that [...] "being naked in front of an audience, you're baring your soul. [...] Not only the soul but the whole body was being exposed. It was very apt, very honest and almost necessary." ...|$|E

Rhimes {{disclosed that}} the main concept for the episode was to [...] "go in places the audience can imagine, but doesn't expect", {{in an attempt to}} [...] "freshen up" [...] the series for the new season. Rhimes stated that she originally planned to move the timeline three months after the conclusion of the second season, but the process did not occur, due to her not wanting the audience to miss significant moments from the character's complex lives. [...] "I feel <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> happened {{at the end of last}} season that I owe it to the characters to have them deal with the aftermath. And I owe it to the audience to let them watch the aftermath", stated Rhimes, in response to her decision to continue the storyline from where the previous season left off. Rhimes also described the prominence which Grey's underwear has in the first episode of the season, noting how they are [...] "a key element" [...] in the development of her character: [...] "Meredith never put them back on. She rushed out to deal with Izzie and left Derek who was asking what that meant, and she never had a chance to put those panties back on." [...] Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rhimes described it as achieving a balance between the aftermath of the recent events and the past experiences that define each character. In addition, she noted how the episode marked the transition to a new chapter in the personal backgrounds of the protagonists, stating: [...] "It was mean to bring us to a place where we can say goodbye to Denny, as well as deal with Meredith's love triangle. Just remember that nothing is ever wrapped up easily on this show. Because things aren't neat and clean in real life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, Darcel had a Vaudeville act, {{which was}} panned {{by at least}} one reviewer. About Darcel's {{performance}} 5 May 1950, at the Strand in New York, the Billboard review said: [...] "Denise Darcel showed her well-stacked chassis ... but her heavily accented English sounded <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> gibberish; it got laughs instead of attention. ... her singing is inadequate, her over-use of hands and arms is clumsy and she shows herself completely at a loss in handling hecklers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Anthony Gallegos of IGN was {{particularly}} {{critical of the}} game and gave the PC version 5 out of 10.

[...] Gallegos criticized several game mechanics he believed were [...] "unnecessary constraints", such as requiring money to obtain new objects and the limited space given for recently purchased objects. He ultimately felt that [...] "Little Inferno's few great ideas fall apart <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> ash." [...] Lucas M. Thomas of IGN, who scored the Wii U version 6.5 out of 10, expressed that the game is hard to recommend and players who enjoyed World of Goo are likely to be disappointed. Official Nintendo Magazine scored the Wii U version 66% but regarded the game as the fourth best Wii U game exclusive to the Nintendo eShop.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2006, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) {{issued a}} public {{statement}} citing {{concerns over the}} program's depiction of abuse, polygamy, use of stereotypes, and television's depiction of moral and civic values in general. Among other things, the church stated, [...] "Despite its popularity with some, much of today's television entertainment shows an unhealthy preoccupation with sex, coarse humor and foul language. Big Love, <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> other television programming, is essentially lazy and indulgent entertainment that does nothing for our society and will never nourish great minds." [...] In March 2009, the LDS Church stated that HBO's writers, producers, and executives were displaying insensitivity to church members by choosing to display simulated segments of the LDS Church's Endowment ceremony in an episode of Big Love. The LDS Church also stated that the show had continued to blur {{the distinction between the}} LDS Church and [...] "the show's fictional non-Mormon characters".|$|E

"an execrable army, more atrocious {{than the}} pagans, neither fearing God nor {{regarding}} man, spread desolation {{over the whole}} province and slaughtered everywhere people of either sex, of every age and rank, destroying, pillaging and burning towns, churches and houses". [...] Monastic chroniclers often deplore depredations made by foreign armies and sometimes even those of their own rulers but some Scots forces were going beyond normal Norman 'harrying' by systematically carrying off women and children as slaves. Walter Espec's speech before the Battle of the Standard Ailred of Rievaulx: Historical Works p 254 In the contemporary Celtic world this was [...] regarded as a useful source of revenue, like (and not significantly more reprehensible than) cattle-raiding. [...] "Then (horrible to relate) they carried off, <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> booty, the noble matrons and chaste virgins, together with other women. These naked, fettered, herded together; by whips and thongs they drove before them, goading them with their spears and other weapons.

2500|$|The Times David Chater commented {{positively}} on {{the episode}} [...] "Elliot's Wonderful Life", writing that: [...] "Holby City fans will love this episode [...] It is highly effective {{in what it}} sets out to do, although – <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> television at Christmas – you need to drink a pint of warm Baileys for the full effect." [...] The episode was selected as recommended viewing by several TV critics, including Dydd Iau of the Liverpool Daily Post, and Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury, who noted: [...] "It sounds a bit strange, but there's snow, carols and an uplifting happy ending for a change." [...] The Mirror Maeve Quigley called it [...] "a timeless story", though questioned the plausibility of {{a world in which}} Elliot's patients went untreated, as [...] "the NHS isn't a one- man band after all". In contrast, Robert Hanks of The Independent reviewed the episode negatively, calling it [...] "incompetent to the point of sacrilege". Hanks wrote: [...] "What it did add to the mix, that James Stewart never achieved, was to give the viewer an authentic frisson of empathy: there was a point towards the end - during an encounter with Elliot's miraculously resurrected, motor-neurone-disease-afflicted yet remarkably soignée and articulate wife - when I began to see never having been born as preferable, sometimes, to prime-time TV." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} {{claims that the}} {{infantry}} {{were the first to}} retire and that, due to a communications breakdown, the 53rd (Welsh) Division made a complete and premature retirement. However, that infantry division had not been told of the movement of the 54th (East Anglian) Division and was still in position. It was not until just before 19:00 that Chetwode phoned Dallas, commander of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, to inform him of the withdrawal of the mounted troops, and the need for him to move his right to reestablish contact with the 54th (East Anglian) Division. Dallas {{was under the impression that}} he was to move back to Sheikh Abbas, [...] from his right on Clay Hill, while Chetwode meant that the two divisions would reconnect [...] north of Mansura and not much over [...] from the 161st (Essex) Brigade, 54th (East Anglian) Division, at Green Hill. Dallas protested, instead asking for reinforcements to close the gap between the two divisions. This request was denied and when he prevaricated, asking for time to consider the order, Chetwode gave him the verbal order, believing the 53rd (Welsh) Division was moving its right back to gain touch with the 54th (East Anglian) Division near Mansura. [...] "Dallas states that he had explained on the telephone the full extent of his withdrawal to General Chetwode; the latter states that he did not understand his subordinate to mean that he was abandoning anything <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> ground. In any case the responsibility rests upon Desert Column Headquarters, since General Dallas had telegraphed to it the line he was taking up." ...|$|E
