In February and March 2012, OPERA researchers blamed this result on a <b>loose</b> <b>fibre</b> optic cable connecting a GPS receiver to an electronic card in a computer. On 16 March 2012, a report announced that an independent experiment in the same laboratory, also using the CNGS neutrino beam, but this time the ICARUS detector, found no discernible difference between the speed of a neutrino and the speed of light. In May 2012, the Gran Sasso experiments BOREXINO, ICARUS, LVD and OPERA all measured neutrino velocity with a short-pulsed beam, and obtained agreement with the speed of light, showing that the original OPERA result was mistaken. Finally in July 2012, the OPERA collaboration updated their results. After the instrumental effects mentioned above were taken into account, it was shown that the speed of neutrinos is consistent with the speed of light. This was confirmed by a new, improved set of measurements in May 2013.|$|E

40|$|The flow behaviour, and {{primarily}} the floc-floc interaction, of pulp paper suspensions {{have been studied}} visually. Analogy models based on these observations have been developed {{as well as the}} identification of important parameters of floc break-up in low shear rate flow fields. Floc compressions and the locations of voids (areas of lower fibre concentration) where found to influence the floc splitting mechanism. Based on this investigation an equipment for measuring the load carrying ability of fibre flocs and networks was designed, and the effect of measurement geometry, network structure and fibre suspension concentration was investigated. The load carrying ability with concentration increases rapidly when going from 1 % to 2 % in initial suspension concentration. A model handling the fibre floc behaviour during extension and compression has been developed, and some basic flocculated flow mechanisms are discussed on an analogy basis. A modified Voigt element is use, describing mainly the compressional behaviour and plastic behaviour of <b>loose</b> <b>fibre</b> network structures. Further the pos- sibility of stress chain formation is discussed on a fibre level as well as on a floc level. The effect of fibre flow (shear field) occurring in the forming zone of a roll former has been studied in detail. Basic forming mechanisms on floc scale has been investi- gated, and the effect of running parameters like dewatering pressure and jet-to-wire speed difference as well as the fibre type and concentration of the pulp suspension has been evaluated. It is evident that floc elongation increases with shear rate (jet-to-wire speed difference) and lower dewatering rate. The latter is because the fibre floc is subjected to the shear field longer due to slower immobilisation. Shorter fibre tends to create weaker networks, which promotes a higher elongation of the flocs. QC 2010090...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is {{studying}} the falling weight impact properties of three different types of hemp/epoxy composites, two of which were realised using <b>loose</b> hemp <b>fibres</b> disposed either unidirectionally (LU laminate) or in a 0 / 90 ° (LC laminate), while the third one has been obtained using hemp mat (M laminate). The maximum fibre volume which was possibly introduced using hand layup was 55 vol. % for LU, 52 vol. % for LC and only 43 vol. % for M laminate. In practice, the {{aim of this}} investigation would be evaluating whether disposing <b>loose</b> hemp <b>fibres</b> in a mat, an operation which results in the reduction of the volume of reinforcement introduced, would yield lower falling impact properties or not. Quasi-static tests results show that the best performance, but also the largest scattering in properties is obtained from the unidirectional composites (LU) : this suggests the fundamental role played by fibre orientation in these materials. In contrast, the study of impact hysteresis cycles suggest that, despite the limitations owed to the presence of through thickness fibres and the lower amount of fibres introduced, hemp mat laminates (M) are superior in terms of impact properties. In particular, impact hysteresis cycles involve, in the case of M laminates, a higher stiffness in the linear-elastic phase of impact, followed by a hardly detectable load drop, and a very large rebound energy, released at quasi-constant rate after penetration. As a result, a larger amount of energy is absorbed during impact on hemp mat laminates than on the loose hemp laminates...|$|R

40|$|In the {{production}} of sawn hardwood a critical processing step is the quality grading. The grading has normally been handled manually in the hardwood sawmills. The process has been labour intensive and a problematic working environment. With the help from existing scanning technology {{it is possible to}} automate the process with several benefits as a result. These are e. g. a decreased need of labour, a better working environment and the possibility to use more complicated grading rules. Thereby the wood could be used in a more optimal way with both cost and environmental benefits. One problem when grading hardwood is that camera and laser based scanning technology has mainly been used on planed surfaces. Normally the quality grading in hardwood sawmills is performed before planing. The wood may then be cross-cutted to components before planing in order to minimise the volume losses because of deformations of the wood pieces. In order to investigate the possibilities to scan the sawn wood before planing rip-sawn birch boards (Betula pubescens Ehrh., Betula pendula Roth.) was scanned before and after planing the wood. The used scanner was a commercial system for automatic sorting of wood. Before the scanning it was estimated that the sawn surfaces exposed to the surrounding environment during drying would not generate any usable results from the scanning. Therefore only the two rip-sawn surfaces were used for evaluation before and after planing. The evaluation was made by comparing the results from the quality grading before and after the planing based on grading rules used by Swedish hardwood sawmill. The results show that there are possibilities to grade the birch wood before planing. The study, however, shows that the scanner has difficulties in detecting small colour variations as brown streaks and fresh knots. It is also difficult to detect fibre angle deviations because of <b>loose</b> <b>fibres</b> on the sawn surface. The possibilities to scan the birch wood are thereby related to the grading rules, i. e. if the mentioned quality parameters are allowed or not. Upprättat; 2010; 20130911 (ysko) </p...|$|R

50|$|There are two {{standard}} {{types of}} trousers, type A and type C. Type A protects only {{the front of}} the legs, and can be supplied as chaps, worn over conventional work clothes, or as conventional trousers. Type C gives protection all around the legs and are almost always worn as ordinary trousers, not over another garment. Chaps are generally used for occasional, farm or homeowner applications. Professional chainsaw operators would choose trousers for comfort and ease of movement, with fallers, ground workers and firewood cutters opting for class A trousers because of the low risk of being cut {{in the back of the}} leg. Climbers and tree surgeons would have to wear type C, as they will be cutting from a wider variety of positions. Type C trousers are, of course, highly insulating, and may lead to heat stress if worn for labour-intensive operations such as firewood cutting.

60|$|It was {{not until}} the summer of 1752 that he was enabled to {{complete}} his grand and unparalleled discovery by experiment. The plan which he had originally proposed was to erect on some high tower or other elevated place a sentry-box, from which should rise a pointed iron rod, insulated by being fixed in a cake of resin. Electrified clouds passing over this would, he conceived, impart to it a portion of their electricity, which would be rendered evident to the senses by sparks being emitted when a key, the knuckle, or other conductor was presented to it. Philadelphia at this time afforded no opportunity of trying an experiment of this kind. While Franklin was waiting for the erection of a spire, {{it occurred to him that}} he might have more ready access to the region of clouds by means of a common kite. He prepared one by fastening two cross sticks to a silk handkerchief, which would not suffer so much from the rain as paper. To the upright stick was affixed an iron point. The string was, as usual, of hemp, except the lower end, which was silk. Where the hempen string terminated a key was fastened. With this apparatus, on the appearance of a thunder-gust approaching, he went out into the commons, accompanied by his son, to whom alone he communicated his intentions, well knowing the ridicule which, too generally for the interest of science, awaits unsuccessful experiments in philosophy. He placed himself under a shade to avoid the rain; his kite was raised; a thunder-cloud passed over it; no sign of electricity appeared. He almost despaired of success, when, suddenly, he observed the <b>loose</b> <b>fibres</b> of his string to move towards an erect position. He now presented his knuckle to the key, and received a strong spark. How exquisite must his sensations have been at this moment! On this experiment depended the fate of his theory. If he succeeded, his name would rank high among those who had improved science; if he failed, he must inevitably be subjected to the derision of mankind, or, what is worse, their pity, as a well-meaning man, but a weak, silly projector. The anxiety with which he looked for the result of his experiment may be easily conceived. Doubts and despair had begun to prevail, when the fact was ascertained in so clear a manner, that even the most incredulous could no longer withhold their assent. Repeated sparks were drawn from the key, a vial was charged, a shock given, and all the experiments made which are usually performed with electricity.|$|R
