This involved risks to macrofinancial stability, in particular because most of these borrowers were unhedged. This paper provides evidence on eleven CESEE countries regarding (1) the extent of foreign currency lending to households from 1995 to 2009, (2) the supply and demand factors {{at work in the}} period before the crisis and (3) the regulatory responses to address the situation. Panel data estimates covering the period from 1996 to 2007 reveal that, on the demand side, foreign currency borrowing was attractive because interest rates for foreign <b>currency</b> <b>loans</b> were lower than those on domestic <b>currency</b> <b>loans,</b> and private sector consumption as well as housing prices were on the rise. Mitigating factors on the supply side were higher interest margins on domestic <b>currency</b> <b>loans</b> than on foreign <b>currency</b> <b>loans</b> and banking sector reforms.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the exchange-rate risk, banks in {{emerging}} markets are typically denominating their <b>loans</b> in foreign <b>currencies.</b> However, {{in the event of a}} substantial depreciation of the local currency, the payment ability of a foreign-currency borrower may be reduced significantly, exposing the lender to additional default risk. This paper analyses how the exchange-rate risk of foreign <b>currency</b> <b>loans</b> spills over into default risk. We show that in an economy where foreign <b>currency</b> <b>loans</b> are a dominant source of financing economic activity, depreciation of the local currency establishes a negative feedback mechanism that leads to higher default probabilities, reduced credit supply, and reduced growth.

40|$|Rationality of {{decision}} maker is often reduced by heuristics and biases, {{and also by}} different types of external stimuli. In decision-making process individuals simplify phases of information selection and information processing by using heuristics, simple rules which are focused on one aspect of complex problem and ignore other aspects, {{and in that way}} 'speed up' decision-making process. This method of making decisions, although efficient in making simple decisions, can lead to mistakes in probability assessment and diminish rationality {{of decision}} maker. In that way it can influence drastically on transaction outcome for which decision is being made. The subject of this study is influence of representativeness heuristic on making financial decisions by individuals, and influence of consumption motives on stereotypical elements in information processing phase. Study was conducted by determining attitudes of respondents toward currencies, and then by conducting experiments with aim of analyzing method of making decisions on <b>loan</b> <b>currency.</b> Aim of study was determining whether and to what extent representativeness influence choice of currency in process of making loan decisions. Results of conducted behavioral experiments show that respondents, opposite to rational model, do not asses probability by processing available information and in accordance with their preferences, but by comparing decision objects with other objects which have same attributes, showing in that way moderate positive correlation between stereotypical attitudes and choice of <b>loan</b> <b>currency.</b> Experiments have shown that instrumental motive significantly influence representativeness heuristics, that is, individuals are prone to process information with diminished influence of stereotypical attitudes caused by external stimuli, in situations where there is no so called 'hedonistic decision-making'.

40|$|In {{the article}} the author {{considers}} {{a problem of}} an optimal way of borrowing during the pre-crisis period (deciding between ruble and foreign currency borrowings). It is obvious that {{during the period of}} stable economic growth, when currency pair rate (for example, ruble - USA dollar) doesn't change significntly, the lower interest rate of foreign <b>currency</b> <b>loans</b> makes them a cheaper way of borrowing. But during a crisis an abrupt growth of currency pair rate can make foreign <b>currency</b> <b>loan</b> a more expensive way of borrowing (as compared to ruble loan). The author suggests a scenario-based method of decision making about an optimal way of borrowing during a pre-crisis period, which affords to calculate a threshold meaning of currency pair rate, after which a foreign <b>currency</b> <b>loan</b> becomes more expensive.

We then test the implications of our model by using a 2005 survey with responses from 9, 655 firms in 26 transition countries. The survey contains details on 3, 105 recent bank loans. At the firm level, our findings suggest that firms with foreign currency income and assets are more likely to borrow in a foreign currency. In contrast, firm-level distress costs and financial transparency affect the currency denomination only weakly. At the country level, the interest rate advantages of foreign currency funds and the exchange rate volatility do not explain the foreign currency borrowing in our sample. However, foreign bank presence, weak corporate governance and the absence of capital controls encourage foreign currency borrowing. All in all, we cannot confirm that "carry-trade behavior" is the key driver of foreign currency borrowing by small firms in transition economies. Our results do, however, support the conjecture that banking-sector structures and institutions that aggravate information asymmetries may facilitate foreign currency borrowing. foreign currency borrowing, competition, banking sector, market structure...|$|R
