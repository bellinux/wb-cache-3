5|$|Females of P. labiata and P. schultzi try to {{kill and}} eat their mates during or after copulation, by {{twisting}} and lunging. The males wait until the females have hunched their legs, making this attack less likely. Males also try to abseil from a silk thread to approach from above, but females may manoeuvre to get the higher position. If the female moves at all, the male <b>leaps</b> <b>and</b> runs away.|$|E
5|$|Devil May Cry {{begins with}} Dante being {{attacked}} {{in his office}} by a mysterious woman named Trish. He impresses her by easily brushing off her assault, and tells her that he hunts demons in pursuit of those who killed his mother and brother. She says the attack was a test, and that the demon emperor Mundus, whom Dante holds {{responsible for the deaths}} of his family, is planning a return. The scene jumps to their arrival at an immense castle, whereupon Trish abruptly <b>leaps</b> <b>and</b> vanishes over a high wall.|$|E

5|$|Females of P. schultzi, {{like those}} of P. labiata, try to kill and eat their mates during or after copulation, by {{twisting}} and lunging.

5|$|Naughty Dog based Drake's {{appearance}} and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville, actor Harrison Ford, and {{the heroes of}} pulp magazines, novels and films. To make him relatable, the character was dressed {{in jeans and a}} T-shirt, and given an everyman persona; he is strong-willed, and often jokes and quips. The designers focused on giving him realistic reactions to his environment; for example, he stumbles while running, barely clears objects during <b>leaps,</b> <b>and</b> recognizes the absurdity of the situations in which he finds himself.|$|E
5|$|Related to weapon {{dances and}} war dances is {{the dance of}} the hunt. A very early {{reference}} to a weapon dance of the hunt {{comes in the form}} of a rock engraving at Çatal Höyük, the large neolithic settlement in south-central Anatolia. It depicts a hunting ritual involving dancers holding their bows; one figure has a bow in each hand, two perform artistic <b>leaps</b> <b>and</b> another holds a horn-shaped stick and is striking a frame drum.|$|E

5|$|The huia's {{movements}} are little known, {{but it was}} most likely sedentary. The huia {{is thought to have}} undertaken seasonal movements, living in montane forests in the summer and moving down into lowland forests in the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes. Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds, the saddleback and the kōkako, the huia was a weak flier and could only fly for short distances, and seldom above tree height. More often it would use its powerful legs to propel it in long <b>leaps</b> <b>and</b> bounds through the canopy or across the forest floor, or it would cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread for balance.|$|E

25|$|The reforms {{aimed to}} {{decrease}} {{the role of the}} state in the economy and gradually introduced private forms of production in agriculture and industry. By 1981, 73% of rural farms had de-collectivized and 80% of state owned enterprises were permitted to retain profits. Within a few years, production increased by <b>leaps</b> <b>and</b> bounds, and poverty was reduced dramatically.|$|E

25|$|Nawab Faizullah Khan, {{who ruled}} Rampur from 1774 to 1794, {{established}} the library from his personal collection of ancient manuscripts and miniature specimens of Islamic calligraphy {{in the last}} decades of the 18th century.

As all the succeeding Nawabs were great patrons of scholars, poets, painters, calligraphers and musicians, the library grew by <b>leaps</b> <b>and</b> bounds.

A couple of days later, Galois made his second and last attempt to enter the Polytechnique, and failed yet again. It is undisputed that Galois was more than qualified; however, accounts differ on why he failed. More plausible accounts state that Galois made too many logical <b>leaps</b> <b>and</b> baffled the incompetent examiner, which enraged Galois.

25|$|Often, Armstrong re-composed pop-tunes he played, simply with {{variations}} {{that made}} them more compelling to jazz listeners of the era. At the same time, however, his oeuvre includes many original melodies, creative <b>leaps,</b> <b>and</b> relaxed or driving rhythms. Armstrong's playing technique, honed by constant practice, extended the range, tone and capabilities of the trumpet. In his records, Armstrong almost single-handedly created {{the role of the}} jazz soloist, taking what had been essentially a collective folk music and turning it into an art form with tremendous possibilities for individual expression.|$|E
25|$|Popular Hawaiian {{music with}} English verse (hapa haole) can be {{described}} in a narrow sense. Generally, songs are sung to the ukulele or steel guitar. A steel string guitar sometimes accompanies. Melodies often feature an intervallic leap, such as a perfect fourth or octave. Falsetto vocals are suited for such <b>leaps</b> <b>and</b> are common in Hawaiian singing, as is the use of microtones. Rhythm is mostly in duple meter. A musical scale that is unique to Hawaiian music imbues it with its distinct feel, and so is aptly named the Hawaiian scale.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} 2 {{years of the}} Republic Comín focused on buildup of the local Requeté {{organization}}; in mid-1935 Zaragoza was able to field only 2 companies; a year later the organization expanded by <b>leaps</b> <b>and</b> bounds; the city could have presented one battalion and {{emerged as one of}} the most mobilized Carlist centers in Spain. Amidst standoff during the first few days of the rebellion in Zaragoza Comín travelled twice to Pamplona to secure reinforcements and came back with some 1,200 Navarrese requetés. The Carlist militiamen helped to overwhelm pockets of workers' resistance in the city, overran the surrounding province and met the Anarchist column advancing from Barcelona some 22km East of the Aragon capital. As a result, Zaragoza, one of the national anarchist strongholds, remained firmly in Nationalists' hands.|$|E
