5|$|Rhenium in {{the form}} of rhenium-platinum alloy is used as {{catalyst}} for catalytic reforming, which is a chemical process to convert petroleum refinery naphthas with low octane ratings into high-octane <b>liquid</b> <b>products.</b> Worldwide, 30% of catalysts used for this process contain rhenium. The olefin metathesis is the other reaction for which rhenium is used as catalyst. Normally Re2O7 on alumina is used for this process. Rhenium catalysts are very resistant to chemical poisoning from nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus, and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions.|$|E

A {{study showed that}} the products were about 40–50 wt.% liquid, 14–16 wt.% gases, while 34–43 wt.% remained as solid residue. <b>Liquid</b> <b>products</b> contained mainly phenol derivatives (∼75wt.%) and bisphenol (∼10wt.%) also present.

25|$|In {{addition}} to transporting gas via pipelines {{for use in}} power generation, other end uses for natural gas include export as liquefied natural gas (LNG) or conversion of natural gas into other <b>liquid</b> <b>products</b> via gas to liquids (GTL) technologies. GTL technologies can convert natural gas into liquids products such as gasoline, diesel or jet fuel. A variety of GTL technologies have been developed, including Fischer–Tropsch (F–T), methanol to gasoline (MTG) and STG+. F–T produces a synthetic crude that can be further refined into finished products, while MTG can produce synthetic gasoline from natural gas. STG+ can produce drop-in gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and aromatic chemicals directly from natural gas via a single-loop process. In 2011, Royal Dutch Shell's 140,000 barrel (16 dam³) per day F–T plant went into operation in Qatar.|$|E
40|$|Biomass can be {{converted}} to <b>liquid</b> <b>product</b> for fuels and for chemicals by hydrothermal treatment. A method for further treatment of the <b>liquid</b> <b>product</b> much depends on the composition determination, and therefore analysis of the <b>liquid</b> <b>product</b> is important. The much water makes the analysis difficult, while much pretreatment will make the analysis complicated and bring more error sources. Herein hydrothermal treatment of cellulose was carried out, and the <b>liquid</b> <b>product</b> was directly analyzed by GC/MS. The major components were identified as some small acids, ketones, some five ring oxygen-containing compounds, and small amounts of some phenol derivatives. Specially, the content of the major component of levulinic acid in two reaction systems are compared, and the effect of the water solvent on the levulinic acid content is discussed. Phenol in the product is specially analyzed by MS/MS mode for assurance, and the result confirms the existence of phenol in the <b>liquid</b> <b>product</b> by hydrothermal treatment of cellulose.

25|$|A higher {{cracking}} temperature (also {{referred to}} as severity) favors the production of ethene and benzene, whereas lower severity produces higher amounts of propene, C4-hydrocarbons and <b>liquid</b> <b>products.</b> The process also results in the slow deposition of coke, a form of carbon, on the reactor walls. This degrades {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, so reaction conditions are designed to minimize this. Nonetheless, a steam cracking furnace can usually only run for a few months at a time between de-cokings. Decokes require the furnace to be isolated from the process and then a flow of steam or a steam/air mixture is passed through the furnace coils. This converts the hard solid carbon layer to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Once this reaction is complete, the furnace can be returned to service.|$|E
25|$|Like {{most other}} flies, the black blow fly feeds via sponging, having {{functional}} or nonfunctional mouthparts. They {{are known to}} feed on various foods, with emphasis on nectar, honey-dew, and the <b>liquid</b> <b>products</b> of decomposition. P. regina, like other flies, is poikilothermic; the growth {{and development of the}} fly is dependent on temperature. At room temperature, the egg to pupal stage lasts about 6–11 h. With an increase in temperature of the surrounding environment, metabolic rates of the blow fly typically increase, causing an increase in the rate of growth and development. In addition to an increase in the growth and development, temperature also has a profound impact on female oviposition. It is key to note the fluctuations between diurnal and nocturnal temperatures. Typically, blow flies will oviposit in the daytime due to the increase of temperature.|$|E

30|$|Density is {{the weight}} {{occupied}} by a substance per unit volume; it is a property which determines the injection and ignition quality of a fuel [24]. The density of the thermal cracking <b>liquid</b> <b>product</b> obtained {{in this study is}} 1.060  g/ml, while that of kaolin catalytic cracking process is 0.800  g/ml. Thus, the density of the <b>liquid</b> <b>product</b> from thermal cracking process is higher than that of the catalytic process. This is expected as the <b>liquid</b> <b>product</b> obtained from kaolin catalytic cracking is light and wax free. On comparing with gasoline with a reported density range of 0.72 – 0.78  g/ml and diesel oil with density range of 0.82 – 0.90  g/ml, the kaolin catalytic <b>liquid</b> <b>product</b> density is between the reported density ranges of gasoline and diesel. The thermal cracking oil product density is absolutely out of gasoline and diesel oil density ranges as it is heavier than both of them. The two <b>liquid</b> <b>product</b> densities from these studies indicate that there are more breaking of the polypropylene C–C covalent bonds to a remarkable extent during the catalytic cracking than during thermal cracking as secondary cracking is facilitated by the use of kaolin as a catalyst. The density of the catalytic pyrolytic liquid obtained is comparable to that of other pyrolytic oils reported: HDPE pyrolytic oil has 0.801  g/ml as density [25], LDPE pyrolytic oil was reported to have 0.815  g/ml as density [9], and PP pyrolytic oil has density of 0.778  g/ml as reported by Panda and Singh [16]. The very little variation can be due to differences in pyrolysis condition, catalyst used, differences in polymeric material, and differences in the method of evaluation. The density of the <b>liquid</b> <b>product</b> obtained from kaolin catalyzed pyrolysis in this study suggests that it can be suitable for use as fuel, while that of thermal cracking might not be suitable.|$|R
