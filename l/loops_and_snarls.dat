5000|$|The Guardian named Fever Ray {{the second}} best album of 2009, calling it [...] "glacial, creepy and impish" [...] and commenting, [...] "Between the {{cavernous}} synths, the echoes <b>and</b> <b>loops,</b> the polyrhythms <b>and</b> <b>snarling</b> vocal processing, Andersson managed {{to capture the}} feeling of being totally alone while also projecting a childlike wonder." [...] It was ranked the second best album of 2009 and twenty-fourth best album of the 2000s decade by Resident Advisor. The Sunday Times named Fever Ray the third best album of 2009 by a new artist and wrote that Andersson [...] "responded to motherhood with an album of glacial sonic architecture, its unforgiving expanses conjuring up sleep-deprived mental churning", dubbing it an [...] "electro classic". NME, Drowned in Sound and Pitchfork all placed the album at number nine on their respective lists of the Top 50 Albums of 2009, with the latter noting that [...] "what's made Andersson's work even better is how her videos and performances amplify the music's sense of dread and mystery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're {{going through}} with it. To {{think of all}} who have gone through with it: all the generations--endless--endless. Little beasts that snapped <b>and</b> <b>snarled,</b> {{snapping}} <b>and</b> <b>snarling,</b> snapping <b>and</b> <b>snarling,</b> generation after generation." ...|$|R

6000|$|And {{toy with}} him in amorous jests, and when he turns, <b>and</b> <b>snarls,</b> <b>and</b> gnaws, O smite him with your jasper claws! and bruise him with your agate breasts! ...|$|R
60|$|Billy halted to give vent {{to his own}} mirth. Saxon {{forced herself}} to join with him, but down in her heart was horror. Mercedes was right. The stupid workers wrangled <b>and</b> <b>snarled</b> over jobs. The clever masters rode in {{automobiles}} and did not wrangle <b>and</b> <b>snarl.</b> They hired other stupid ones to do the wrangling <b>and</b> <b>snarling</b> for them. It was men like Bert and Frank Davis, like Chester Johnson and Otto Frank, like Jelly Belly and the Pinkertons, like Henderson {{and all the rest}} of the scabs, who were beaten up, shot, clubbed, or hanged. Ah, the clever ones were very clever. Nothing happened to them. They only rode in their automobiles.|$|R
60|$|Helen's excited ears, {{so full of}} throbs and imaginings, {{presently}} registered low snaps <b>and</b> <b>snarls.</b> Bo {{gave her}} arm a squeeze.|$|R
60|$|Ugh-lomi stood {{watching}} for a space, <b>and</b> <b>snarled</b> {{at the sight}} of Uya. Then he turned and plunged into the thicket.|$|R
5000|$|Muddle, Jumble <b>and</b> <b>Snarl</b> - Sky Clone's minions. The three imps are {{comic relief}} {{and are often}} {{head-to-head}} with Whirl and Twirl.|$|R
60|$|Over {{and over}} they rolled, Johnny Chuck on top, then Reddy Fox on top, then Johnny Chuck up again, clawing <b>and</b> <b>snarling.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are coming}} for us!" [...] shouted Whopper, and the {{statement}} proved true. With wild yelps <b>and</b> <b>snarls</b> the wolves leaped forward.|$|R
50|$|Christopher {{provided}} {{the voice of}} the monster; he growled <b>and</b> <b>snarled</b> as the contestants made their moves, and he also gave periodic taunts.|$|R
50|$|The cast is rounded out by Sir Nicholas's curmudgeonly uncle Snarl, whose money Sir Nicholas {{hopes to}} inherit, <b>and</b> <b>Snarl's</b> whore Mrs. Figgup.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} the latter stood his ground with arched back <b>and</b> <b>snarling</b> face, {{for all the world}} like a great, spotted tabby.|$|R

6000|$|... "Vanine, {{that looked}} {{on all the}} danger past, [...] Because he 'scaped so long, is seized at last; [...] By p----, by hunger, and by Dryden bit, [...] He grins <b>and</b> <b>snarls,</b> <b>and,</b> in his dogged fit, [...] Froths at the mouth, a certain sign of wit." ...|$|R

60|$|Both gangs surged forward, {{growling}} <b>and</b> <b>snarling.</b> In {{a second}} {{there would be}} a free-for-all fight, and he would be robbed of his vengeance. He was beside himself.|$|R
5000|$|... 1937 - New fully chromed {{fuel tank}} {{with red and}} black lined cream panels <b>and</b> <b>snarling</b> Panther logo. This was {{the last year of}} the [...] "Redwing" [...] Model 100 ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the smoke}} cleared away the two boy hunters saw two wolves {{stretched}} upon the ground, dead. The {{rest of the}} pack had retreated, yelping <b>and</b> <b>snarling</b> more frightfully than ever.|$|R
60|$|As the man's hand {{approached}} his neck, White Fang bristled <b>and</b> <b>snarled</b> <b>and</b> crouched down. But while he eyed the approaching hand, he {{at the same}} time contrived {{to keep track of the}} club in the other hand, suspended threateningly above him. Matt unsnapped the chain from the collar and stepped back.|$|R
60|$|Godfrey {{levelled}} his gun, {{which was}} charged with buck-shot, and fired both barrels. Terrific yells and howls followed, and the opening was clear in a moment, though Godfrey could see two or three dark figures on the snow. There was a sound of whimpering <b>and</b> <b>snarling,</b> <b>and</b> then of a fierce fight outside.|$|R
60|$|The {{man turned}} <b>and</b> <b>snarled</b> at him. He knew well enough that escape or {{resistance}} alike was hopeless. He {{was like a}} pigmy {{in the hands of}} the man who held him.|$|R
60|$|The snorts <b>and</b> <b>snarls</b> that {{escaped from}} {{him for the}} next {{quarter of an hour}} went far to support the truth of the old saying that two of a trade never agree.|$|R
60|$|The wolves {{now seemed}} to grow {{impatient}} <b>and</b> snapped <b>and</b> <b>snarled</b> loudly as they crowded around the tree and tried to leap up towards the boys. They were evidently a hungry lot.|$|R
5000|$|Kerrang {{magazine}} {{said the}} album was [...] "glorious" [...] and that [...] "Turbowolf truly excel", describing the sound as [...] "a tasty thick soup of distorted boogie rock, psychedelic weirdness <b>and</b> <b>snarling</b> punk attitude." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{had brought}} along a little tent and {{sleeping}} bags, and after supper made themselves as comfortable as possible. The dogs had been fed and they snapped <b>and</b> <b>snarled</b> over the bones thrown to them.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a most}} miserable Sunday; {{and several}} of the sailors had twinges of the rheumatism, and pulled on their monkey-jackets. As for Jackson, he was all the time rubbing his back <b>and</b> <b>snarling</b> like a dog.|$|R
60|$|That {{they would}} be very disagreeable {{customers}} with whom to have any dispute could be well understood as they ran to and fro growling <b>and</b> <b>snarling,</b> <b>and</b> despite his resolve not to borrow trouble until {{he knew there was}} a possibility it could come, Jet could not prevent himself from speculating upon what would happen if he suddenly appeared before them.|$|R
60|$|The {{boys had}} to skirt some heavy brushwood, {{and then came}} out in a small cleared space {{surrounded}} by numerous big rocks and pine trees. The strange noises they had heard had come from between two of the large rocks, and now, of a sudden, several forms, snapping <b>and</b> <b>snarling</b> <b>and</b> whirling this way and that in the snow, burst upon their view.|$|R
60|$|He {{cursed the}} brutes fiercely, {{but could not}} cow them. They replied with neck-bristling <b>and</b> <b>snarling,</b> <b>and</b> with quick lunges against their breastbands. He remembered Oleson, and turned his back upon them and went along the trail. He {{scarcely}} took notice of his lacerated leg. It was bleeding freely; the main artery had been torn, {{but he did not}} know it.|$|R

60|$|The {{dogs were}} penned up, {{and made the}} air hideous with their barking <b>and</b> <b>snarling.</b> All the {{supplies}} were taken on board, and then the Ice King steamed away from Etah on her voyage into the great Unknown.|$|R

50|$|The Autobots {{returning}} to Cybertron along with Blackarachnia and Silverbolt were then abducted via teleportation beams {{and taken to}} Unicron.
