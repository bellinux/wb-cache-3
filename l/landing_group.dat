2500|$|The next morning, 9 April 1940, Odin {{took part}} in the defence of Kristiansand, against <b>landing</b> <b>group</b> four of the German {{invasion}} of Norway. When the battle at Kristiansand between the Kriegsmarine flotilla and Odderøya Fort began Odin steamed out into the Toppdalsfjord and opened up on attacking Luftwaffe bombers with her Oerlikon 20 mm cannon and two 12.7mm anti-aircraft machine guns. Continuous evasive manoeuvring saved the destroyer from being hit by the many bombs dropped at her and several hits were recorded on the attacking aircraft, although none were shot down. At about 07:30 a twin-engined aircraft attacked the interned [...] that was docked in Kristiansand harbour, having been seized by Norwegian warships for neutrality violations after running aground on the Oddene shallows near Mandal 27 March that year. U-21 had been docked in Kristiansand since 28 March. Odin fired at the aircraft, only to discover it was a RAF Lockheed Hudson reconnaissance aircraft. Neither this time did the Odins fire bring her target down. At 1000hrs an order not to fire at British and French forces came to the commander of Kristiansand. This order, combined with confusion of which flags were flown by the intruding warships, led to the German force being able to enter the harbour unopposed on their third attempt at 1030hrs. Odin was captured at Marvika naval station together with numerous other naval vessels in the Kristiansand area, including her sister ship [...]|$|E

Pulmo-nary function was assessed by measuring the forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow rate (FER), force expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1) and force expiratory volume at one second/forced vital capacity (FEV 1 / FVC). [Results] Following the intervention, the aqua group showed significant changes in FVC, FER, FEV 1, and FEV 1 /FVC. The <b>land</b> <b>group</b> showed only significant differences FER.

On 5 July 1943 the Northern <b>Landing</b> <b>Group</b> went ashore at Rice Anchorage. Progress for Liversedge and other elements invading New Georgia was agonizingly difficult and slow due in greater part to hostile jungle terrain and weather than Japanese resistance.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{consists}} of {{a review of existing}} literature relating to Incorporated <b>Land</b> <b>Groups</b> in Papua New Guinea (PNG), followed by a case study of two urban incorporated <b>land</b> <b>groups</b> (ILGs) in the city of Lae. The paper is an attempt at assessing the sustainability of ILGs in the country. The challenges facing the ILGs have heightened public fears that the <b>land</b> <b>groups</b> may not be sustainable. Based on the argument in previous studies that the ILGs are not sustainable, the paper used primary data from two separate questionnaire surveys of randomly selected ILG landowners (including legal settlers) and ILG stakeholders to investigate the problem. The combined sample size of 129 respondents (32. 7 %) was representative of the total ILG population, while a total of 25 indicators were used to test the respondents’ perceptions regarding ILG sustainability. Findings reveal that only one of the indicators received the positive support of the stakeholders, while no indicator was supported by the landowners. This suggests that the ILGs in PNG are not sustainable legal entities. This dilemma is a consequence of the challenges facing the ILGs, including the issues of corruption in the Lands Department, illiteracy among landowners, poor publicity given to ILGs’ functions, and the dysfunctional ILG legal framework...|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} young, healthy females was {{undertaken}} {{to compare the}} effectiveness of a progressive resistance quadriceps muscle strengthening programme in water to one performed on land. The water (n = 19) and the land (n = 18) groups exercised five times a week for eight weeks, according to a modified DeLorme protocol, while the control (n = 16) group did not exercise. All three groups underwent isokinetic testing for their knee flexors and extensors at weeks 0, 4 and 8 at the speeds of 60 °/s and 270 °/s. The water and <b>land</b> <b>groups</b> had their 10 Repetition Maximum (10 RM) measured before and at weekly intervals during the trial. Questionnaires were completed before, during {{and at the end of}} the trial. There was no significant difference between the water and the <b>land</b> exercise <b>groups</b> on isokinetic or 10 RM testing. However,the <b>land</b> <b>group</b> experienced a significant reduction in comfort while exercising as the exercise weights became heavier, while the water group remained comfortable throughout. Although there was no significant difference in the number of subjects complaining c F post-exercise muscle soreness, those with muscle soreness in the water group had more severe muscle soreness. Significantly more subjects in the <b>land</b> <b>group</b> complained of pain while exercising than the water group. Progressive resistance exercise for quadriceps strengthening can thus be done as effectively in water (using home-made water weights) as on land. Isotonic testing (10 RH) showed significant strengthening of both groups each week (except for week 1 to week 2 in the <b>land</b> <b>group)</b> whereas isokinetic testing showed no increase in strength, power or endurance of the exercised leg at 60 °/s over eight weeks. Some significant increases were seen at 270 °/s in the <b>land</b> and control <b>groups</b> over eight weeks, probably as a result of familiarisation to the test procedure. There was no correlation between the 10 RM and peak extension torque or extension work of the exercised leg at 60 °/s before,during or at the end of the trial. Isokinetic testing does not seem to be ideal following isotonic muscle strengthening in this population...|$|R
