50|$|Adenosine deaminases {{acting on}} RNA (ADAR) are enzymes {{responsible}} for binding to double stranded RNA (dsRNA) and converting adenosine (A) to inosine (I) by deamination. ADAR protein is a RNA-binding protein, which functions in RNA-editing through post-transcriptional modification of mRNA transcripts {{by changing the}} nucleotide content of the RNA. The conversion from A to I in the RNA disrupt the normal A:U pairing which makes the RNA unstable. Inosine is structurally {{similar to that of}} guanine (G) which leads to I to cytosine (C) binding. In RNA I functions the same as G in both translation and replication. Codon changes can arise from editing which may lead to changes in the coding sequences for proteins and their functions. Most editing site are found in noncoding regions of RNA such as untranslated regions (UTRs), Alu elements and <b>long</b> <b>interspersed</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>element</b> (LINEs).

50|$|The RNA coded by the short-interspersed nuclear element {{does not}} code for any protein product but is {{nonetheless}} reverse-transcribed and inserted back into an alternate {{region in the}} genome.

SINEs are believed to have co-opted the proteins coded by LINEs which are contained in 2 reading frames. Open reading frame 1 (ORF 1) encodes a protein which binds to RNA and acts as a chaperone to facilitate and maintain the LINE protein-RNA complex structure. Open reading frame 2 (ORF 2) codes a protein which possesses both endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities. This enables the LINE mRNA to be reverse-transcribed into DNA and integrated into the genome based on the sequence-motifs recognized by the protein’s endonuclease domain.|$|E

Studies have largely been restricted to the comparison of a few genes in established cell lines derived from different tissues, and most of these genes do not change replication timing. Hence, it has not been possible to predict how many or what types of genes might be subject to such control. Here, we have evaluated the replication timing of 54 tissue-specific genes in mouse embryonic stem cells before and after differentiation to neural precursors. Strikingly, genes residing within isochores rich in GC and poor in <b>long</b> <b>interspersed</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>elements</b> (LINEs) did not change their replication timing, whereas half of genes within isochores rich in AT and <b>long</b> <b>interspersed</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>elements</b> displayed programmed changes in replication timing that accompanied changes in gene expression.

In LTR retrotransposons, after the RNA template is degraded, a DNA strand complementary to the reverse-transcribed cDNA returns the element to a double-stranded state.

Resistance to DMIs is mediated either through alterations {{in the structure of}} the target enzyme CYP 51 (encoding 14 α-demethylase), through increased expression of the CYP 51 gene, or through increased expression of efflux pumps. We found that CYP 51 expression in DMI-resistant (DMIR) isolates of the cherry leaf spot pathogen Blumeriella jaapii was increased 5 - to 12 -fold compared to that in DMI-sensitive (DMIS) isolates. Analysis of sequences upstream of CYP 51 in 59 DMIR isolates revealed that various forms of a truncated non-long terminal direct repeat <b>long</b> <b>interspersed</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>element</b> retrotransposon were present in all instances.

40|$|Epigenetically silent transposons and repeats {{constitute}} a substantial proportion of eukaryotic genomes, but {{their impact on}} cellular gene function remains largely unexplored. In Arabidopsis, transposons are silenced by DNA methylation, and this methylation is often abolished by mutations in a chromatin-remodeling gene DDM 1 (DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1). The ddm 1 mutation induces various types of developmental abnormalities through de-repression of transposons and repeats. Here, we report a novel mechanism for a ddm 1 -induced syndrome, called bonsai (bns). We identified the gene responsible for the bns phenotypes by genetic linkage analysis and subsequent transcriptional analysis. The bns phenotypes are due to silencing of a putative Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC) 13 gene. The BNS gene silencing was associated with DNA hypermethylation, which {{is in contrast to}} the ddm 1 -induced hypomethylation in the other genomic regions. This paradoxical BNS hypermethylation was reproducibly induced during self-pollination of the ddm 1 mutant, and it was mediated by a <b>long</b> <b>interspersed</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>element</b> (LINE) retrotransposon flanking the BNS gene.

Here we describe the first investigation into the expression of genes encoding the DNA methylation machinery in the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria).
