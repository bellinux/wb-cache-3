40|$|Based on {{a global}} survey of photojournalism and case studies of recent transformations {{in the use of}} {{photography}} in sport, this paper critically analyses current professional practices of sport photojournalists focusing on the contemporary challenges faced by this industry. Rhetoric proclaiming the death of the photographer in the age of video technology and self-mass communication of digital photographs has presented a major challenge to the survival of photographers and photography as a professional practice in news media. In the specific field of sport photojournalism, photographers have faced added challenges of accreditation to sport with the selective access to sporting venues or events through commercial licensing of “preferred media partners” and increasing management of “image rights” and anti-piracy measures. This has occurred at a time when sport images and the digital distribution of sporting images are greater than ever.

40|$|The {{development}} of prosodic capabilities in infants {{has been studied}} extensively. Yet generalizations about particular capabilities emerging across {{the first year of}} life are surprisingly hard to tie down. Results have often been contradictory, in part because approaches to the study have been divergent. A traditional approach with an innatist bias has sought to demonstrate very early mastery of adult-like speech characteristics of the prosodic system. More recently, research has sought to illustrate that infants actively build a phonological system, including both prosodic and syllabic features. In our approach, adult-like features of speech are not expected to emerge fully formed early in life, but to unfold in infrastructural stages. This unfolding suggests that infant vocal categories evolve toward adult-like, language-specific features. Here, we preview a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>project</b> <b>on</b> infant vocal development, and argue that two widely-studied prosodic phenomena (final-syllable lengthening and pitch control) show complexities that require recognition of the infant’s active participation in {{development of}} prosody. This exploratory participation leads to nuances that contradict simplistic generalizations about early emergence of adult-like prosodic structures...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate th×e relationship between the magnitude of an earthquake, the fear experienced, the self-efficacy beliefs, and post-traumatic stress symptoms in adolescents. We expected self-efficacy beliefs to predict post-traumatic stress symptoms, and this relation to be mediated by fear. We used data from a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>project</b> <b>on</b> adolescent normative development that was under way at the time of the 2010 earthquake in Chile. Six months before the earthquake, 218 adolescents responded to a self-efficacy beliefs scale; three months after the earthquake they reported the perceived magnitude of the event, the fear they experienced, and their post-traumatic stress symptoms. Results showed that perceived magnitude was not associated with fear or post-traumatic stress symptoms, but self-efficacy beliefs and fear were associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms. The hypothesized role of fear as a mediator in the relation between self-efficacy beliefs and post-traumatic stress symptoms was supported by the data. The results of the study, suggest that preventive interventions aimed to increase awareness of how to face a disaster may not only contribute to save lives but may also increase adolescentś sense of personal efficacy, reducing subsequent emotional reactivity associated with the event...|$|E

It was hypothesised that the overarching national (and international) commitment of the post- 1994 government to reform society to become an inclusive system serving the needs of all would impact on four of the main pillars of the STI system, viz. national policy objectives, funding of the system, the human resource composition (specifically race) and steering/control mechanisms. The research approach consisted of qualitative analyses of official published information. The analyses supported the hypothesis with regard to policy changes, the transformation of the human resource base, at least at managerial and executive levels, and the tightening of steering of the public STI system. It was found, however, that funding of the system relative to GDP in effect stalled while new policies were put in place. Funding has started rising moderately since 2001. The paper concludes by identifying six sets of developments that both individually and in combination would probably influence the further evolution of the STI system...|$|E

40|$|Ongoing {{globalisation}} poses {{a distinct}} challenge {{to how we}} understand what work ‘is’ in the contemporary world. Theoretical distinctions between the spatialities and temporalities of work as a practice have become blurred, along with understandings of work purely as an economic rather than a socio-cultural phenomenon. Building on theoretical approaches within geography and the ‘new sociology of work’, this paper argues that the transformation of work produced by contemporary globalisation requires a more sophisticated and geographically informed understanding of the spatiality of work as a practice. It develops this contention by presenting research into a specific kind of (unconventional) work – international youth volunteering. It argues that this form of work has a complex spatiality, whose constitution and impacts exceed the specific material location of workers in both space and time. Furthermore, it examines how this ‘multiplex mode’ of work practice destabilises the relationship between work and non-work, and facilitates the development of cultural capital, self-identity and skills in young people. It also contends that this form of voluntary work {{is embedded in the}} emerging needs of global labour markets. These arguments are elaborated through the presentation of research from a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>project</b> <b>on</b> the impacts of international youth volunteering. This research consists of data from interviews and focus groups with young people who undertook a range of different types of overseas voluntary work placement, and interviews with corporate recruiters in leading transnational firms concerning their understanding of the value (or otherwise) of international volunteering...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} therefore was to investigate the communication between African American parents diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) and their African American adult children, especially because of the high rate of T 2 D in this population. More specifically, this study used the Family Systems Illness Model and Illness Narrative to investigate the meaning that T 2 D had in the lives of 20 African American families. The study sample was recruited from the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS), a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>project</b> <b>on</b> stress and health, producing interviews of 21 diabetic adults and their adult children. This study analyzed these data. A phenomenological approach was used in this qualitative study, which had a unique perspective as both the parent diagnosed with T 2 D and their adult child were present for the interviews. The results showed that T 2 D’s onset, course, outcome, and degree of incapacitation in relatives, as well as beliefs about T 2 D, impacted the meaning of the illness for both the diagnosed parents and their adult children in this sample. These findings underline the importance of family experiences with T 2 D as potentially contributing to better healthcare programs for individuals and families affected by this illness...|$|E

MethodsThe study is part of the Mixed <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>Project</b> <b>on</b> Growth, Development and Physical Fitness of Ilhabela. The study included 1, 291 students of both genders, aged 10 to 11 years old. The study periods were: 1978 / 1980, 1988 / 1990, 1998 / 2000, and 2008 / 2010. The variables analyzed were: body weight, height, and cardiorespiratory fitness (VO 2 max - L. min- 1 and mL. kg- 1. min- 1) performed using a submaximal progressive protocol on a cycle ergometer. Individuals were classified as normal weight and overweight according to curves proposed by the World Health Organization of body mass index for age and gender. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with three factors followed by the Bonferroni method were used to compare the periods. ResultsThe number of normal weight individuals (61 %) was higher than that of overweight. There was a significant decrease in cardiorespiratory fitness in both genders. Among the schoolchildren with normal weight, there was a decrease of 22 % in males and 26 % in females. In overweight schoolchildren, males showed a decrease of 12. 7 % and females, of 18 %. ConclusionDuring a 30 -year analysis with reviews every ten years from 1978 / 1980, there was a significant decrease in cardiorespiratory fitness in schoolchildren of both genders, which cannot be explained by the nutritional status. The decline in cardiorespiratory fitness was greater in individuals with normal weight than in overweight individuals...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{changing}} epidemiology {{of malaria}} in Sub-Saharan Africa {{over the last}} decade needs further understanding. A <b>longitudinal</b> <b>project</b> <b>on</b> the epidemiology of malaria was set up in the Nyamisati village, Rufiji District, Tanzania in 1985. Cross-sectional surveys have revealed a gradual decrease in parasite prevalence over the last 25 years, from > 90 % to 13 % (by PCR), despite the absence of large scale control interventions. Although PCR improves the detection of low-level parasitemia, assessment of parasite prevalence alone may not fully reflect the level of exposure in a population. In order to further understand the long-term dynamics of malaria transmission in this setting, we combined an assessment of parasite prevalence with analyses of IgG antibodies against antigens of the P. falciparum parasite and a salivary antigen of the Anopheles vector. Methodology: The study included children 1 - 16 years old participating in cross-sectional surveys in Nyamisati village in 1995, 1999 and 2010. Parasite prevalence was established by microscopy and PCR. Detection and quantification of IgG antibodies against P. falciparum whole schizont extract (PfSE) and Anopheles gambiae salivary gland protein 6 (gSG 6) were performed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Levels of IgG antibodies against merozoite surface protein 1 - 19 (MSP- 119) and merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP- 2) were assessed using a multiplexed bead-based immunoassay. Results and conclusions: The prevalence of anti-PfSE IgG as well as the levels of IgG antibodies against MSP- 119 and MSP- 2 decreased between 1995 and 2010, with the most marked reduction among the youngest children (1 - 4 years of age). The levels of anti-gSG 6 -IgG were, however, relatively stable over time. These findings suggest a substantially decreased intensity of malaria transmission in the Nyamisati area over the past 15 years, without an equally evident decrease in the population level of exposure to the malaria vector...|$|E

This paper is part of a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>project</b> <b>on</b> the evolution of the South African science, technology and innovation (STI) system since 1994, the year that marked the end of apartheid government. Given that the overarching national (and international) commitment of the post- 1994 government has throughout been the normalisation and correcting of past discrimination, it was hypothesised that changes to the STI system would entail reforming it to become an inclusive system by changing the three pillars of the STI system, viz. national objectives, the human resource composition (race and gender equity) and steering/control mechanisms. The primary level of analysis focussed on initiatives (including allocation of resources) of the Ministry of Science and Technology, with cross-references to developments in two other ministries also involved in the STI system, viz. (Higher) Education and Trade and Industry. The analyses showed, firstly, that the core STI missions were changed substantially over time. Secondly, extensive transformation has been brought about on the human resource dimension in terms of both race and gender equity, although the gender distribution remains skewed at management level. Thirdly, the government has introduced a range of new steering mechanisms and significantly tightened its control on both public universities and research institutions. The paper concludes by identifying four imminent challenges confronting the STI system, viz. the distribution of public financial support; finding the balance between advanced postgraduate studies and professional/technical training/skilling of unemployed youth; proving the benefits of STI for improving the lot of the still very large deprived section of the population; and improving the country's international competitiveness...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{construct}} of metacognitive knowledge—that is knowledge on cognitive processes, was {{established as a}} determinant of cognitive development in the 1970 s. Early research focused on the domain of memory development in pre- and primary school children. While research activities on metacognition have diversified over time, some core issues in the assessment, structure, and development of metacognitive knowledge still remain unresolved: (1) How can metacognitive knowledge be assessed? (2) How does metacognitive knowledge develop in secondary school? (3) Is metacognitive knowledge domain-specific or domain-general? (4) To what extent are developmental changes in metacognitive knowledge and achievement interrelated? We addressed these research questions within our <b>longitudinal</b> research <b>project</b> <b>on</b> the development of knowledge components. Our database included 928 German students who were tested on six measurement points (from Grades 5 to 9). The focus of the longitudinal study was on the assessment of metacognitive knowledge, as well as achievement in mathematics, reading comprehension, English as a foreign language, and the changes in these variables over time. In this chapter, the main results on these four research questions are presented, after {{a brief description of}} the historical research background. The results of the last assessment period are given special emphasis...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A., Theatre Arts) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. In her <b>longitudinal</b> {{research}} <b>project</b> <b>On</b> the Road: A Search for American Character, Anna Deavere Smith {{created a}} performance process blending journalism and theatre, {{and by doing}} so succeeded in capturing an inherent essence of character through language, tone and gesture by recreating verbatim excerpts from conducted interviews onto the stage. In most of her works, Smith applies politically driven and event based topics that affect targeted groups or cultures within a community such as the Hasidic Jews and African Americans of Crown Heights, Brooklyn featured in Smith's earlier work Fires in the Mirror. In the following Master's thesis, I provide a comparative analysis of my adaptation of Smith's docu-theatre process and argue its ability to succeed by accessing a personal and familial-based topic with its own social repercussions - namely Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, I explain {{the effectiveness of this}} adaptation given the instructional and informational application of the topic of my play, Sweetening the Broccoli: Reflections on Alzheimer 's that can be targeted towards a more specific audience of caregivers and family members of Alzheimer's patients. mnittee Chair DeTmda S. 69 d/ h Dade vTheatre Art...|$|R
40|$|The broad {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between exposure to community violence and adjustment in an urban sample of African American youth living in Chicago. After years of research on community violence, there has been a call to understand the influences of all levels and systems on child adjustment, as well as to use research to promote positive outcomes and prevention of future violence (Aisenberg 2 ̆ 6 Herrenkohl, 2008). With this in mind, this project used latent profile analysis to create profiles of protection based on individual, family, peer, and community factors, as well as evaluate the extent to which these factors interact to contribute to the adjustment, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, in youth exposed to community violence. The current study was conducted using an archival dataset of a larger <b>longitudinal</b> study (<b>Project</b> <b>on</b> Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods) examining on exposure to community violence, and what contributes to it, as well as the effects of exposure. Results suggested a 2 -class solution of protective factors best described the African American participants in the study. The largest class (75. 51...|$|R
