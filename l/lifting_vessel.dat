50|$|After {{designing}} the roadway, Beckett {{found that there}} was no anchor available that was light enough to be easily handled without a <b>lifting</b> <b>vessel,</b> yet had sufficient holding power which he calculated as 20 tons plus a safety factor. Everall was away in America, so Beckett developed a design for an anchor in his own time, performing experiments with models of anchors in the mud at Erith Yacht Club where he was a member. The full-size anchor weighed 330 kg and, during performance tests using a large tug, it held up to 30 tons. The Ministry of Supply ordered 2,332 Kite anchors, as they became known, to be manufactured at a total cost of £89,786, with more than 2,000 of the anchors being used on the two Mulberry harbours.|$|E

40|$|Marine lifting {{operations}} play a {{key role}} in the installation of turbines and bottom-fixed foundations. Offshroe installations of the bottom-fixed foundations, tripod foundation in this study, are costly and risky due to the challenging environmental conditons and the bulkiness of the object. It becomes more and more challenging due to the tendency to intall larger turbines in the sites further away from shoreline. To minimize the risks and better prepare the operations, careful study and analysis are essential. This thesis addresses numerical studies of the installation of tripod foundations using a heavy lift vessel (HLV). Both frequency and time-domain methods are applied in the study. Investigation is first carried out in the frequency domain using the response aptitude operators (RAOs) of the HLV. The wave induced rigid body motions of the vessel are calculated, represented by response spectrum and spectral moment. Thus, the vertical motion of the crane tip can be predicted, which is used as a criterion to find the limiting weather. As the frequency domain method is based on the simplification of linear response, detailed numerical modelling and simulation of the installation system have been carried out in time domain to analyse the coupled dynamic system. The predicted limiting weather using frequency domain method is firstly verified in time domain by running stationary simulations. It is found that the predicted limiting sea states are inaccurate. The calculated limiting (significant wave height) is underestimated with (spectral peak period of the wave) approaching the natural periods of the installation vessel. During the lifting operations, some potential critical events may be encountered, such as slack wire or re-hit, collision with the <b>lifting</b> <b>vessel</b> due to excessive motions of the tripod. To identify the potential risks, nonstationary simulations are conducted with emphasis on two lifting scenarios, the lift-off and the lowering phases. Moreover, comparative studies in response using two types of installation vessel, the HLV and the Jack-up, are investigated for the lowering process. Furthermore, sensitivity study on various hoisting speeds is also performed for the case onboard lift-off. It is found that the wire tension and response of the tripod using the jack-up are relatively smaller, during the lowering process in the selected sea states, than the case utilizing floating vessel. Especially for the lowering in air, huge difference exists between the two types of installation vessels and barely any tripod motion is induced for the jack-up case thanks to the great bottom-fixed stability. Compared to the onboard lift-off, it turns out that there would be much more challenges for the lift-off from barge. Under the considered wave condition, the onboard lift-off operation can be smoothly implemented while the operation from the barge experiences snap load and re-hit...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} {{decommissioning}} of offshore petroleum platforms have been investigated. It treats decommissioning in general, {{the process of}} a typical project. A variety of suitable lifting vessels have been presented, and some concepts of removal have been evaluated. Decommissioning is important {{to go through with}} because of the environment {{and the use of the}} area after the petroleum activities ceases. Other ocean users benefit from the decommissioning because the area can be utilized when it is opened for ordinary traffic. The environment will benefit from the cessation of production because of fewer spills to sea or risk of it and being restored to a state as close to possible to original. Sometimes it is found acceptable to leave facilities behind, partially or wholly, and the marine life in the area can actually benefit from this in some cases. A decommissioning project consists of the elements planning and approval, topside and jacket preparatory work, topside removal, jacket removal, transport, and onshore dismantling and recycling. There are two main concepts of removal, reverse installation and single lift. The elements of the project are the same whichever of the concepts are used. The vessels to be used need large lifting capacities in either concept. Especially designs that lift topsides and jacket in single lifts can improve the efficiency in the projects. Several lifting vessels have been presented and a few concepts were reviewed regarding future requirements. The concepts were platform removal using only a traditional HLV, topside removal using HLV and jacket removal using buoyancy tanks, and removal using the new <b>lifting</b> <b>vessel</b> design Pieter Schelte. It is found that all the concepts can remove fixed platforms, but Pieter Schelte was especially well-suited. When Pieter Schelte is used, personnel will be exposed to less risk because more work is done onshore. Onshore work is in general more inexpensive, faster, cleaner, and safer. This gives a better HSE profile to the project as well as being more cost-efficient. On the downside, the vessel is not available before 2013. In the meantime the alternative with the HLV and buoyancy tanks can gain some more experience. This alternative scored the same as removal with reverse installation and is therefore not so successful in this comparison. There are however uncertainties involved and the solution with the buoyancy tanks are still interesting. The challenges in decommissioning are to make it less expensive, less time-consuming, and safer than today as well as keeping the environmental issues satisfactory. This can probably be reached by making the process more standardised to some extent, making use of new technologies like new vessels, doing less work at the offshore site, carrying out less lifts offshore, and do a lot of the dismantling work onshore. Pieter Schelte can to a great extent be the solution to these challenges. </p...|$|E
