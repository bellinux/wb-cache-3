30|$|AT {{force was}} {{calculated}} by multiplying the pedal reaction force with a gear ratio (foot <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> divided by tendon <b>lever</b> <b>arm).</b> Foot <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> was determined as {{the distance between the}} first metatarsal and the centre of the medial malleolus and tendon <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> as the distance between the medial malleolus and the posterior surface of the calcaneus (Peltonen et al. 20102012). <b>Lever</b> <b>arm</b> lengths were taken as a projection along the sole of the foot when it was perpendicular to the shank. Therefore, <b>lever</b> <b>arms</b> were considered to be perpendicular to the line of force.|$|R
40|$|A {{transportation}} robot's <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> have {{an effect}} on the comfort and safety of patients. Improved arms have been designed through dynamic and static analyses to increase safety if a sheet not present on the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms.</b> To design the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms,</b> experimentation is very helpful, however, it is difficult and dangerous to experiment on patients; therefore, a simple human model was made and used for the dynamic analysis. Through the dynamic analysis results, a safe width and comfortable location for the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> were determined. The thickness was then determined by static analysis and optimum design. In addition, tests have been conducted to confirm comfort and safety by deploying the designed <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> onto a transportation robot...|$|R

50|$|StreetStrider is {{the brand}} name for a mobile {{elliptical}} trainer. The StreetStrider consists of a T-shaped lower frame to which two front wheels and a rear wheel containing a drive assembly are attached, and an upright frame to which two reciprocating <b>arm</b> <b>levers</b> are attached. Two elongated foot platforms {{on either side of}} the lower frame are attached to cranks as part of the drive assembly, which, as with bicycle drivetrain systems, also includes a hub, a rotating axle, and an internal hub gear system translating the axle rotation to the hub. The StreetStrider drive assembly is either chained or chainless direct drive, depending on model. The lower end of each <b>arm</b> <b>lever</b> is attached to the front end of each foot platform, which, by connection in the rear to the rotating crank arm and in the front to the pivoting <b>arm</b> <b>lever,</b> moves generally in an elliptical path. The device also includes a leaning mechanism for steering, as well as brakes and multiple gearing. It was developed by David W. Kraus.|$|R

40|$|The device {{consists}} of two grab elements, each with a grab jaw section and a <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> section. The <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> sections are charged by a movable power-transmitting element, which is tensioned against the <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> sections by a tensioner device. An actuator is formed by a piezo adjusting element, which is charged by an electrical control voltage. This lengthens the element {{in the direction of}} the <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> sections, so that it presses against the power-transmitting element, which in turn is driven {{in the direction of the}} <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> sections. This causes the grab jaws to move about joints, and towards each other. ADVANTAGE - Simple to manufacture, modular construction...|$|R

50|$|Problems often {{arise in}} {{incorporating}} a Walschaerts valve gear {{into the design}} of tank and narrow gauge locomotives because of space limitations. The reversing rod (with its <b>lifting</b> <b>arm),</b> needed to change between forward and reverse running, is therefore mounted {{at the same level}} as the pivot of the expansion link. This enables the lifting link (German: HÃ¤ngeeisen) to be dispensed with, and the <b>lifting</b> <b>arm</b> to be connected directly to the radius rod. To ensure the required horizontal movement, the back end of the radius rod is designed as a slide (the 'Kuhn slide') which fits into a rotatable crosshead (Gleitstein) in the <b>lifting</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
40|$|When {{placing the}} {{components}} during THA {{the goal is}} to restore the optimal biomechanics of the hip. Evidence suggests that correct placement of the components {{plays an important role in}} order to prevent impingement, provide optimal conditions for the abductor muscles and minimize polyethylene wear. The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical effect of increasing the abductor <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> in minimally invasive total hip arthroplasty. We compared the abductor <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> of the operated hip to the <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> of the contralateral native hip on radiographs in 148 patients following THA. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether they kept their anatomical <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> or had an increase in the <b>lever</b> <b>arm.</b> The clinical outcome was assessed using Hip Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), Harris Hip Score and UCLA activity score. Evaluations took place at 6 weeks, 4 months and 1 year postoperatively. Patients who kept their anatomical <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> did not experience a significantly better clinical outcome than the patients who had an increased abductor <b>lever</b> <b>arm.</b> The results of this study suggest that an increase in the abductor <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> does not have detrimental effects on the clinical outcome after THA. To avoid the potential negative effects of a diminished <b>lever</b> <b>arm,</b> the surgeon should aim for an equal or slightly increased <b>lever</b> <b>arm...</b>|$|R
