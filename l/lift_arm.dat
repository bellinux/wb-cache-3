40|$|Tractors {{of today}} come {{equipped}} with a CAN-system. A CAN-system sends information from sensors to electronic control units who process the signals. The sensors measure several interesting parameters such as force, pressure and speed for various components of the tractor. This thesis discuss a force sensor which {{is placed in the}} pivot of the tractors three point linkage, the sensor measure the horizontal reaction force from the load that the tractor is exposed to. Signals from this sensor can be used to measure the force from any implement that the tractor is exposed to during an operation. The results from this thesis can be used for research purposes, for example, to compare implements from different manufacturer or to optimize the implement settings during an operation. However, there is a problem that this thesis aimed to solve by developing a method which can be put into practice. When a constant force from an implement is acting on the three point linkage, the reaction force in the pivot of the three point linkage (where the force sensor is attached) is going to vary depending on the angel of the lower <b>lift</b> <b>arm.</b> It is not uncommon that the angel of the lower <b>lift</b> <b>arm</b> is varying, because different implement and soil require different settings on the linkage. This means that the force which is measured by the sensor may vary in size even though the actual force does not vary. To solve this problem, theoretical calculations have been performed and equations to describe the variation of the reaction force depending on the geometry have been created. The theory has also been verified by a finite element analysis and a practical verification test. The conclusions from these three parts correspond to each other. Theoretically that means by knowing the horizontal reaction force (measured by the force sensor) and the angles of the geometry on the three point linkage (can be measured with a position sensor) you can calculate the force an implement influence the tractor with. However, there is a problem which prevents this method from being completely reliable. It is only working when the impact force is completely parallel to the horizontal plane. Since many implements are being pulled to the soil (plow, cultivator, etc.) in practice there are also vertical forces affecting the tractor. This is no problem to solve in theory, but in practice this method does not compensate for the vertical force. This vertical force should be examined more carefully before the method can be used reliably in full scale...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to examine the challenges of applying virtual reality techniques to the interactive stress analysis of a tractor <b>lift</b> <b>arm.</b> NURBS-based free form deformation, finite element analysis, sensitivity analysis, collision detection, and virtual reality are combined to create an interactive environment for designers to view and modify part shape, evaluate the resulting stresses, and check for interference of the new part shape and surrounding parts in real-time. These methods are implemented using a surround screen virtual environment where the part of interest and associated geometry surrounding that part are displayed together using stereo projection to provide a three-dimensional view of the assembly. 2 Introduction Manufacturing companies are continually trying to reduce the time required to take an idea from product conception to market so they can increase their competitiveness, maintain or increase their market share, and ultimately gain higher profits. This time reduction means fewer hours to develop the product, and fewer physical prototypes of the design that can be tested. With developments in computer codes, designers now rely more heavily on computer analysis and simulation as a way {{to reduce the number of}} costly prototypes and the time required to test them. Analysis and simulation leads to fewer prototypes, because it allows designers to solve many design problems before the first prototypes are built. Finite element analysis (FEA) is one form of structural analysis commonly used by manufacturing companies. Virtual reality (VR) is a unique human-computer interface that allows the user to use natural head and hand movements to interact with the objects in the environment...|$|E
40|$|Project (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Design and {{analysis}} of multi body system is a challenging task that requires the knowledge of machine design, computer aided design (CAD), finite element analysis and structural dynamics. Wheel loader vehicle {{is a type of}} earth moving machine which falls in the category of multi body system. This project is based on the concepts of reverse engineering where in which the wheel loader is designed and analyzed to precision. Initially the dimensions of the wheel loader are documented by using vernier caliper and full scale ruler. These dimensions are vitally implemented in generating the 3 D model of the wheel loader. SolidWorks has been used for 3 D model creation. In order to run the design to real time standards a few design modifications are taken into account. Design of <b>lift</b> <b>arm</b> cylinders, lift arms, tilt/bucket cylinder and connecting rod are modified to real time standards. Kinematics of wheel loader has been analyzed in SolidWorks. For kinetics and structural analysis the model has been exported from SolidWorks to MSC Visual Nastran Desktop 4 D. In order to analyze the structural dynamics, the method of finite element analysis is used. The results obtain from the stress analysis are within the range of yield stress of materials used for designing of wheel loader. The design is verified to be real time with the factor of safety 1. 2. Reverse engineering process is helpful to analyze the existing model and helps in improving design. Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E

50|$|Problems often {{arise in}} {{incorporating}} a Walschaerts valve gear {{into the design}} of tank and narrow gauge locomotives because of space limitations. The reversing rod (with its <b>lifting</b> <b>arm),</b> needed to change between forward and reverse running, is therefore mounted {{at the same level}} as the pivot of the expansion link. This enables the lifting link (German: Hängeeisen) to be dispensed with, and the <b>lifting</b> <b>arm</b> to be connected directly to the radius rod. To ensure the required horizontal movement, the back end of the radius rod is designed as a slide (the 'Kuhn slide') which fits into a rotatable crosshead (Gleitstein) in the <b>lifting</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
