2500|$|During {{their writing}} partnership, Wagner and Mills had {{submitted}} story {{ideas to the}} BBC for the TV series Doctor Who in the 1970s, but Wagner eventually dropped out, tired of the endless rewrites requested, an experience which turned him off TV writing. Mills' involvement {{came to an end}} when the show's script editor changed. Artist Dave Gibbons was aware of this, and when he was offered the chance to draw the <b>lead</b> <b>strip</b> in Doctor Who Weekly in 1979, he suggested them as writers. The pair wrote four eight-part serials, based on their unmade TV scripts. They adapted them separately, Wagner scripting [...] "City of the Damned" [...] and [...] "Dogs of Doom", and Mills scripting [...] "The Iron Legion" [...] and [...] "The Star Beast", although all were credited to [...] "Mills & Wagner".|$|E

5000|$|The word {{comes from}} <b>lead</b> <b>strips</b> that were put between set lines of lead type, hence the {{pronunciation}} [...] "ledding" [...] and not [...] "leeding". When type was set by hand in printing presses, slugs, or <b>strips</b> of <b>lead</b> of appropriate thicknesses were inserted {{between the lines}} of type to add vertical space, improving legibility.|$|R
60|$|Inside the temple, out of {{the line}} of fire, Charlie had the two little field pieces, each crammed to the muzzle with bullets, placed in {{readiness}} to fire. The lower floor of the tower had been pierced, above the gateway, and here two huge caldrons filled with boiling <b>lead,</b> <b>stripped</b> from the roof, stood ready for action.|$|R
50|$|Individual Anatolian hieroglyphs are attested {{from the}} second and early first millennia BC across Anatolia and into modern Syria. The {{earliest}} examples occur on personal seals, but these consist only of names, titles, and auspicious signs, {{and it is not}} certain that they represent language. Most actual texts are found as monumental inscriptions in stone, though a few documents have survived on <b>lead</b> <b>strips.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The PM-79 is a small, {{circular}} Bulgarian blast-resistant anti-personnel mine, superficially {{similar to}} the Russian PMN. The mine uses a unique trigger design; {{on the top of}} the mine, beneath a thin rubber cover is a dish shaped pressure plate. Pressure on the outer rim of the dish shaped plate levers up a central post, which triggers the mine. The mine also incorporates a mechanical arming delay using a pin cutting through a thin <b>lead</b> <b>strip.</b> The mine arms in between two minutes and four hours depending on the temperature.|$|E

50|$|The grid is {{constructed}} {{of a series}} of alternating parallel <b>strips</b> of <b>lead</b> and a radiolucent substance such as a plastic, carbon fibre, aluminium, even paper. The grid is placed between the patient and the detector during the exposure. Primary beam radiation passes through the radiolucent strips as it travels roughly parallel to them, but scattered radiation which has, almost by definition, deviated from the parallel beam, cannot easily pass through the grid as it encounters the <b>lead</b> <b>strips</b> at an angle, and is attenuated, or lost, from the beam.|$|R

5000|$|Like the Eagle, Girl {{was founded}} by the Rev. Marcus Morris. The <b>lead</b> <b>strip</b> was {{originally}} [...] "Kitty Hawke and her All-Girl Air Crew", drawn in full colour by Ray Bailey, {{about a group of}} women running a charter airline. The strip was not very popular - it was apparently felt to be too masculine - and it was moved to the black and white interior pages, replaced on the cover by the schoolgirl strip [...] "Wendy and Jinx", written by Michael and Valerie Hastings and drawn by Bailey.|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{published}} {{under the}} title Playhour Pictures, the title was shortened with issue 32 to Playhour. Playhour {{was intended as a}} companion to Jack and Jill, initially aimed at a slightly older audience. The <b>lead</b> <b>strip</b> in its early days was [...] "Prince, the Wonder Dog of the Golden West", drawn by Sep E. Scott. With issue 32 (21 May 1955) it lowered its target age-group and introduced comic strips based on A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh and Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows, both drawn by Peter Woolcock.|$|E
50|$|The PMN-1 mine is armed by {{removing}} a steel ring-pull {{at the end}} of the horizontal fuze. When in position, the pin on the end of the ring-pull holds a spring-loaded striker back from the stab-detonator. Pulling out the ring-pull starts an arming delay, which comprises a thin steel wire (held under tension by the spring-loaded striker) which must cut through a small strip of lead before it is freed. The process of cutting through the <b>lead</b> <b>strip</b> takes between 2 and 12 minutes, depending on ambient temperature. After the wire has completely cut through the <b>lead</b> <b>strip,</b> the spring-loaded striker is freed and slides forward a few millimetres before stopping, blocked by the sliding gate of the pressure plate mechanism. At this point the mine is fully armed i.e. the only thing holding back the spring-loaded striker from the stab-detonator is a weak creep-spring on the pressure plate mechanism. Subsequently, any downward pressure on the pressure plate (i.e. when someone steps on the mine) overcomes the upward pressure of the creep-spring and pushes down the sliding gate that holds back the spring-loaded striker. This action frees the striker which flips forward into the stab detonator, firing both it and the adjacent tetryl booster which triggers detonation of the main TNT explosive filling. It is not a blast resistant mine.|$|E
5000|$|These {{conditions}} {{were difficult to}} achieve, since {{as soon as one}} requirement was achieved the others would go wrong. The purpose of making all from the same field was to avoid special cases. However, they were eventually required to be made from 20 to 40 master fields. As regards changing keys, the printer was given <b>lead</b> <b>strips</b> bearing the pattern of each of the 36 rows, of which 24 were chosen for each raster. The minimum message length was initially set to 60 characters but was lowered to 45 by the army after some use. Fricke asked the TICOM interrogators ...|$|R

50|$|The {{magazine}} {{began with}} Millar's Kick-Ass 2, American Jesus, Nemesis and Superior, plus reprints of Jonathan Ross's Turf and Frankie Boyle's original series Rex Royd. There are also regular features including text features and interviews, {{the subject of}} the latter in the first issue was comedian Jimmy Carr. Following the conclusion of Kick-Ass 2, the second volume of CLiNT began with Super Crooks as the <b>lead</b> <b>strip</b> for one issue before the launch of Hit-Girl. Millar's The Secret Service, which began in the second volume, features art from Dave Gibbons. The magazine was officially renamed as Mark Millar's CLiNT from August 2012.|$|E
50|$|Having {{previously}} been the <b>lead</b> <b>strip</b> in the short-lived Hot Shot comic, Playmaker {{went on to}} become one of the more popular strips of the latter years of Roy of the Rovers (1989-92). The story followed Andy Steel, a prodigious 15-year-old midfielder for Millside City in the First Division. Later strips would see him transfer to rich Second Division club Lands Park, and finally to big-name Spanish side Real Catania, along with his team-mate and fellow prodigy Kevin Radnor. The final strip in 1992 saw Catania win the Spanish league, and the now 17-year-old Steel finally gaining his first call-up to the full England team.|$|E
50|$|To {{coincide}} {{with the release of}} the 2007 movie, Titan Magazines produced a new UK monthly title called Transformers. The first issue went on sale on July 27, 2007. The book contains a ten-page original <b>lead</b> <b>strip,</b> and reprints six or seven pages per issue of IDW's movie prequels and Beast Wars: The Gathering. It is edited by Steve White, who also worked for Marvel UK's Transformers title; the UK strips are written by Simon Furman. Artists have included Geoff Senior and Nick Roche, and are to include Andrew Wildman, Don Figueroa and Nick Roche, with Guido Guidi and Marcelo Matere confirmed on issues 5 and 6.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{they had}} eaten their breakfasts, they wrapped {{themselves}} up in their cloaks, pressed their hats over their heads, and sallied out. It was not until {{they were in the}} streets that they realized how great was the force of the gale. Not only were the streets strewn with tiles and fragments of chimney pots, but there was light enough for them to see that many of the upper windows of the houses had been blown in by the force of the wind. Tiles flew about like leaves in autumn, and occasionally gutters and sheets of <b>lead,</b> <b>stripped</b> from the roofs, flew along with prodigious swiftness.|$|R
50|$|George Munro {{fought for}} the British {{government}} at the Battle of Dunkeld in 1689 where the Jacobites were defeated. He held command as a Captain in the Cameronian 26th Regiment of Foot. The Battle of Dunkeld {{is said to have}} lasted four to five hours. The Cameronian regiment of 1200 men was outnumbered by a force of 5000 Jacobites. In the first hour of the battle the Colonel of the Cameronian regiment was killed and the Major was wounded so the command fell to Captain George Munro. It is said that they had to use <b>lead</b> <b>stripped</b> off the roofs of houses and melted in the ground for ammunition. The Jacobites were eventually defeated.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} ancient Aramaic {{inscriptions}} {{dating back to}} the 2nd century CE were uncovered in Elymais. Although the letters appear quite similar to the Mandaean ones, it is doubtful whether the inhabitants of Elymais were Mandaeans. Under Parthian and early Sasanian rule, foreign religions were tolerated. The situation changed by the ascension of Bahram I in 273, who {{under the influence of the}} zealous Zoroastrian high priest Kartir persecuted all non-Zoroastrian religions. It is thought that this persecution encouraged the consolidation of Mandaean religious literature.The persecutions instigated by Kartir seems to temporarily erase Mandaeans from recorded history. Traces of their presence can still however be found in the so-called Mandaean magical bowls and <b>lead</b> <b>strips</b> which were produced from the 3rd to the 7th centuries.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the serial stories, a few standalone strips were normally published. Usually these were humorous and featured the same lead character week after week. Alley Cat, Penny Crayon, and others were a single page long, while Sue's Fantastic Fun-Bag! ran to two pages each week. A <b>lead</b> <b>strip</b> in the early days, often taking the cover slot, was The Jinx From St Jonah's, which normally featured a standalone story but occasionally continued it in a subsequent week. An exception to the humour format was the storyteller format, in which the same narrator would each week tell a different spooky or eerie story. In Jinty, that narrator was the character Gypsy Rose.|$|E
50|$|The Super-Heroes lasted fifty {{issues before}} being {{cancelled}} in early 1976, {{at which point}} it was merged into Spider-Man Comics Weekly, (which changed its title to Super Spider-Man with the Super-Heroes). At this point the book also changed orientation to become a landscape-format comic like The Titans. The aforementioned Titans title ran 58 issues until late 1976, when it too was cancelled. Towards {{the end of its}} run, the Avengers were moved over from The Mighty World of Marvel to be The Titans <b>lead</b> <b>strip.</b> As with The Super-Heroes, with The Titans cancellation it was merged with the weekly Spider-Man comic (which changed its title again, to Super Spider-Man and the Titans).|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} mosaics of Roman Pompeii, {{dated to}} the Pompeian First Style of wall {{painting in the}} late 2nd and early 1st centuries BC, were clearly derived from the Hellenistic Greek model. However, the contained far more figured scenes on average, less abstract design, the absence of <b>lead</b> <b>strips,</b> {{as well as an}} almost complete lack of complex, three-dimensional scenes utilizing polychromy until the Pompeian Second Style of wall painting (80-20 BC). The mosaics in the Villa Romana del Casale (c. 300 AD) from Roman Sicily perhaps represent the hallmark of mosaic art in the Late Imperial period. The mosaic decoration of the local palace complex culminates in the gallery, which contains a scene of animal hunting and fighting covering an area of 3200 sq ft.|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} design had a low, tapered high {{aspect ratio}} wing and was powered by two Gipsy Six R engines, a specially-tuned {{version of the}} new Gipsy Six. Construction was almost entirely of wood, metal being confined to high-stress components such as the engine bearers and undercarriage, and to complex curved fairings such as the engine cowlings and wing root fairings. The sheet metal parts were composed of a magnesium-aluminium alloy. Manually operated trailing edge split-flaps were fitted below the inboard wing sections and lower fuselage, while the Frise ailerons were mass balanced by <b>lead</b> <b>strips</b> within the wing's leading edges. Rudder and elevators had horn mass balances. In order to prove the wing design a half-scale model wing was built and tested to destruction.|$|R

So furious had been the gusts, that high {{buildings}} in town had had the <b>lead</b> <b>stripped</b> off their roofs; and in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of windmills carried away; and gloomy accounts had {{come in from the}} coast, of shipwreck and death. Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages of wind, and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been the worst of all.|$|R
50|$|Marvel Comics {{released}} an eight-issue comic book series. It had no regular writer. Each issue {{was written by}} such notables as Steve Gerber (issues #3 and #5), Ann Nocenti (issue #7), David Leach & Jeremy Banx (<b>lead</b> <b>strip</b> script & artwork) and David Michelinie (back up strip) (issue #8), Hilary Barta (issue #2), and Simon Furman (issues #1, 4, 6). A four book mini series was written and drawn by David Leach & Jeremy Banx. The series was solicited and the first issue written and drawn before being canceled along with all of Marvel TV tie-in titles. One issue was a direct parody of Captain Planet and the Planeteers. Issue #8 was the only mainstream US comic book ever published to carry an 'Approved by the Comic Code Authority' stamp {{while at the same}} time featuring a man sat on the toilet defecating.|$|E
50|$|Russell {{branched}} out into comic books during the 1940s when import restrictions gave Australian comics a lion's {{share of the}} market. At the beginning of 1947, Jim and his older brother, Dan, began their own publishing company, All-Australian Comics. The lead title of the company was Tex Morton's Wild West Comics, starring the popular country music singer. Like many Australian comics of the time, it was a copy of American material, in this case, featuring cowboy actors such as Roy Rogers and Gene Autry. Tex Morton was always featured in a lead-off story along with his mates Jacky, Shorty and Slim, drawn by Dan Russell. For {{the first two years}} companion features were Keith Chatto's Bunny Allen, Les Dixon's Alfie the Jackaroo and a series of bush yarns by Jack Hemming. Early in 1949 they added another title, Kanga's K.O. Comics, with the <b>lead</b> <b>strip</b> drawn by Russell, who used the pseudonym 'Mick Newton'. Russell also used the pseudonym on a revised version of Wanda Dare in Tex Morton Comics (the earlier version of Wanda Dare, a lady reporter, having previously been drawn by Dan).|$|E
