5|$|L'Hermite's {{force had}} {{been caught in the}} same {{hurricane}} that had dispersed Willaumez, and as a result his ships were scattered and damaged on 20 August, one frigate joining the remains of Willaumez's squadron in the United States and the others <b>limping</b> back to France. Most succeeded in slipping through the British blockade independently, including Régulus, which arrived at Brest on 5 October, but one ship was less successful: on 27 September 1806 the frigate Président became the final French casualty of the campaign when it was trapped in the Bay of Biscay by Louis' squadron. Closed in from all sides, the approach of Louis' flagship Canopus convinced Captain Labrosse that continued resistance was impossible and he struck his colours without a fight.|$|E

Knave leaves her there and returns home but Lad finds her. Several days later, the still <b>limping</b> Lady accidentally gets locked in the library and is subsequently blamed for the destruction of the Master's beloved mounted bald eagle. The Master starts to whip her, but Lad intervenes and takes the whipping himself, knowing Knave was the culprit. Later, he attacks Knave for getting Lady in trouble, sending him fleeing from the Place. As the Master apologizes to Lad, Lady lovingly licks his wounds from the fight.|$|E
5|$|Although L'Hermite {{achieved}} minor successes against individual British shipping, his {{force was}} too small to have a serious impact on British trade in the region and the promised reinforcements failed to materialise {{in the aftermath of the}} destruction of the Cadiz fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, ten days before L'Hermite sailed although before news of the battle had reached Lorient. In early January 1806, L'Hermite managed to capture a small British naval brig but was still unable to make any significant impact on British trade operations. In the spring of 1806 L'Hermite withdrew across the Atlantic, taking on supplies and effecting repairs in neutral Brazil. During the return journey to France in August 1806, the squadron was caught in a major hurricane and one frigate was severely damaged, <b>limping</b> to a port in the United States for repairs. The rest of the squadron continued on to France, L'Hermite reaching Brest in his flagship Régulus. The other frigate was intercepted by a British blockade squadron on 27 September 1806 and captured in the Bay of Biscay.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of Results May Vary, <b>Limp</b> Bizkit joined the band Korn on a tour called the Back 2 Basics Tour. The Back 2 Basics Tour, which was {{sponsored}} by Xbox, was scheduled for November 2003. However, during a concert at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom, Durst was hit by an object thrown from the crowd. Durst finished the remaining two songs of <b>Limp</b> Bizkit's set and after the concert, Durst had seven stitches administered by a private physician. During the end of 2003, <b>Limp</b> Bizkit cancelled their tour dates in Southeast Asia after there was a United States Department of State warning of increased security threats abroad. <b>Limp</b> Bizkit planned to play shows in Bali, Bangkok and Manila. However, after a terrorist bombing in Istanbul, Turkey occurred, the United States Department of State issued a travel advisory, and <b>Limp</b> Bizkit cancelled the shows in Southeast Asia.

5|$|By 10:00, {{all three}} French ships were {{within range of}} Centurion and a heavy {{exchange}} of fire began. Within 15 minutes, both Centurion and Marengo had their colours shot away and at 10:45 the ship of the line turned away for open water, followed by the frigates, her rigging in disarray. Damage had rendered Centurion unable to manoeuvre rapidly and she began slowly <b>limping</b> inshore to shelter from Marengo among the coastal shoals. Captain Lind rejoined his ship by boat, hailing the Princess Charlotte, which had still not participated in the battle, to cut her anchor cables and go ashore to avoid being captured. Logan refused and at 11:15 surrendered without a fight as the whole French squadron moved back towards the harbour. Marengo again remained beyond the sandbars that marked the entrance. The boatloads of sepoys, who were still en route to Princess Charlotte, turned about and rowed back to shore to avoid capture. Sémillante took possession of the merchant ship while Marengo and Atalante engaged Centurion, which had moved {{out of range of}} support from the shore batteries.|$|E
5|$|On the Tar Heels' {{first play}} of the game, running back Jonathan Linton ran up the middle for a three-yard gain. After the gain, Carolina quarterback Chris Keldorf {{completed}} a 31-yard pass to tight end Alge Crumpler for a first down at the Virginia Tech 47-yard line. Now inside Virginia Tech territory, Linton ran for a five-yard gain, which {{was followed by a}} pass from Keldorf to Linton, who gained 26 yards on the play. Following the catch, North Carolina had a first down at the Virginia Tech 16-yard line. Linton left the field <b>limping</b> slightly, and backup running Mike Geter replaced him, then ran for four yards up the middle. Geter was stopped for no gain on the next play, and a third down pass by Keldorf fell incomplete. North Carolina kicker Josh McGee entered the game to attempt a 29-yard field goal, which was good. With 9:15 remaining in the quarter, North Carolina took a 30 lead.|$|E

Feola changed the entire defense, including the goalkeeper, while in midfield he returned to the formation of the first match. During the game, Portugal defender João Morais fouled Pelé, but was not sent off by referee George McCabe. Pelé had to stay on the field <b>limping</b> {{for the rest of the}} game, since substitutes were not allowed at that time. After this game he vowed he would never again play in the World Cup, a decision he would later change.|$|E

40|$|Lysosomal {{integral}} membrane protein- 2 (<b>LIMP</b> 2) mediates trafficking of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) to lysosomes. Deficiency of <b>LIMP</b> 2 causes action myoclonus-renal failure syndrome (AMRF). <b>LIMP</b> 2 -deficient fibroblasts virtually lack GBA {{like the}} cells of patients with Gaucher disease (GD), a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GBA gene. While GD {{is characterized by the}} presence of glucosylceramide-laden macrophages, AMRF patients do not show these. We studied the fate of GBA in relation to <b>LIMP</b> 2 deficiency by employing recently designed activity-based probes labeling active GBA molecules. We demonstrate that GBA is almost absent in lysosomes of AMRF fibroblasts. However, white blood cells contain considerable amounts of residual enzyme. Consequently, AMRF patients do not acquire lipid-laden macrophages and do not show increased plasma levels of macrophage markers, such as chitotriosidase, in contrast to GD patients. We next investigated the consequences of <b>LIMP</b> 2 deficiency with respect to plasma glycosphingolipid levels. Plasma glucosylceramide concentration was normal in the AMRF patients investigated as well as in <b>LIMP</b> 2 -deficient mice. However, a marked increase in the sphingoid base, glucosylsphingosine, was observed in AMRF patients and <b>LIMP</b> 2 -deficient mice. Our results suggest that combined measurements of chitotriosidase and glucosylsphingosine can be used for convenient differential laboratory diagnosis of GD and AMR...|$|R

5|$|Sailing {{directly}} from his blockade station off Cadiz, Saumarez's squadron consisted of six ships of the line, {{twice the number}} under Linois's command. Discovering the French at anchor in Algeciras {{on the morning of}} 6 July, Saumarez launched an immediate attack on the anchorage through the complicated shoals of Algeciras Bay. Although the initial attack caused severe damage to the French ships, light winds and shallow water led to the British ship HMS Hannibal grounding under heavy fire while the French vessels were driven on shore to prevent their capture. With his intentions frustrated, Saumarez ordered his squadron to withdraw, five of his ships <b>limping</b> out of the bay while the batted Hannibal remained trapped. Isolated and unable to manoeuvre, Captain Solomon Ferris on Hannibal endured the enemy fire for another half an hour before surrendering his ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{first group}} {{was the only}} one to contain four teams: Argentina, Chile, France and Mexico. Two days after France's victory over Mexico, they faced group favourites Argentina. Injuries {{hindered}} France; goalkeeper Alex Thépot had to leave the field after 20minutes, and Laurent, after a fierce tackle by Luis Monti, spent most of the match <b>limping.</b> However, they held out for most of the match, only succumbing to an 81st-minute goal scored from a Monti free kick. The game featured an officiating controversy when referee Almeida Rêgo erroneously blew the final whistle six minutes early, with Frenchman Marcel Langiller clear on goal; play only resumed after protests from the French players. Though France had played twice in 48 hours, Chile had yet to play their first match. They faced Mexico the following day, gaining a comfortable 3–0 win.|$|E
5|$|The second French squadron, under Vice-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, cruised in the South Atlantic and the Caribbean {{during the}} spring and summer of 1806, {{conducting}} several successful raids on British islands in the West Indies. His ability to affect British trade was hampered by the deployment of British squadrons against him and the disobedience of Captain Jérôme Bonaparte, the Emperor's brother. On 18 August an Atlantic hurricane dispersed his ships, causing severe damage and forcing them to take shelter in friendly or neutral harbours in the Americas. Waiting British ships destroyed one vessel, and several others were so badly damaged that they never sailed again, the four survivors <b>limping</b> back to France individually over the next two years. The various British squadrons deployed against him failed to catch Willaumez, but their presence had limited his ability to raid British trade routes.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately for Captain Segond, when dawn broke on 18 October, HMS Anson was {{revealed}} {{only a short}} distance off, <b>limping</b> southwards after the damage its rigging and masts had suffered before the battle on 12 October. Although his ship was almost unmanageable, Captain Durham {{was not prepared to}} lose a second opportunity to engage, and slowly brought his vessel to bear on Loire, which was unable to escape. Accompanying Anson was Kangaroo, recovered from the damage of 16 October and ready for further action. At 10:30, Anson and Loire began firing on one another, neither able to effectively manoeuvre and both relying on firepower to overwhelm their opponent. Kangaroo closed on the unprotected stern of Loire, firing as she did so and repeatedly raking the immobile French ship. By 12:00 Loire had lost her mainmast and was leaking badly, forcing Segond to surrender. His ship was towed to port as the sixth prize of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Within {{hours of}} departing from Toulon, the {{squadron}} {{was struck by}} a heavy gale. One of the ships of the line lost its mainmast and turned back for Toulon, and the remainder of the force was scattered. The British blockade force sighted the disparate squadron on the following morning and although the French escaped pursuit, HMS Minerve succeeded in capturing one of the isolated merchant vessels. By 25 March, all but three of Ganteaume's ships had been recovered and the force was <b>limping</b> southwards through the Tyrrhenian Sea when it ran directly into Warren's squadron as it returned from Sicily. Ganteaume turned southeastwards to escape and Warren gave chase, the faster vessels in his squadron gaining on the French but the slower ships, particularly HMS Gibraltar and HMS Athenienne, falling far behind. Concerned that this placed his squadron in danger of becoming separated during the night, Warren ordered his faster ships to slow down and gradually lost sight of the French during the evening. Ganteaume took advantage of the respite to turn northwards in the darkness, and once again returned to Toulon.|$|E
5|$|Active, {{the only}} British ship still in {{fighting}} condition, took up {{pursuit of the}} retreating enemy and at 12:30 caught the Corona in the channel between Lissa and the small island of Spalmadon. The frigates manoeuvred around one another for the next hour; captains Gordon and Pasqualigo each seeking the best position from which to engage. The frigates engaged in combat at 13.45, Active forcing Coronas surrender 45minutes later after a fire broke out aboard the Italian ship. Active too had suffered severely and as the British squadron was {{not strong enough to}} continue the action by attacking the remaining squadron in its protected harbour on Lesina, the battle came to an end. The survivors of the Franco-Venetian squadron had all reached safety; Carolina and Danaé had used the conflict between Active and Corona to cover their escape while Flore had indicated to each British ship she passed that she had surrendered and was in British possession despite the absence of a British officer on board. Once Flore was clear of the British squadron she headed for safety, reaching the batteries of Lesina shortly after her Carolina and Danaé and ahead of the <b>limping</b> British pursuit. The smaller craft of the Franco-Venetian squadron scattered during the battle's final stages and reached Lesina independently.|$|E
