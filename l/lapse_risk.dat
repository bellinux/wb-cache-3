40|$|This study {{analysed}} mechanisms {{through which}} stress-coping and temptation-coping strategies {{were associated with}} lapses. Furthermore, we explored whether distinct coping strategies differentially predicted reduced <b>lapse</b> <b>risk,</b> lower urge levels, or a weaker association between urge levels and lapses {{during the first week}} of an unassisted smoking cessation attempt. Participants were recruited via the internet and mass media in Switzerland. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with mobile devices was used to assess urge levels and lapses. Online questionnaires were used to measure smoking behaviours and coping variables at baseline, as well as smoking behaviour at the three-month follow-up. The sample consisted of 243 individuals, aged 20 to 40, who reported 4199 observations. Findings of multilevel regression analyses show that coping was mainly associated with a reduced <b>lapse</b> <b>risk</b> and not with lower urge levels or a weaker association between urge levels and lapses. 'Calming down' and 'commitment to change' predicted a lower <b>lapse</b> <b>risk</b> and also a weaker relation between urge levels and lapses. 'Stimulus control' predicted a lower <b>lapse</b> <b>risk</b> and lower urge levels. Conversely, 'task-orientation' and 'risk assessment' were related to higher <b>lapse</b> <b>risk</b> and 'risk assessment' also to higher urge levels. Disengagement coping i. e. 'eating or shopping', 'distraction', and 'mobilising social support' did not affect <b>lapse</b> <b>risk.</b> Promising coping strategies during the initial stage of smoking cessation attempt are targeted directly at reducing the <b>lapse</b> <b>risk</b> and are characterised by engagement with the stressor or one's reactions towards the stressor and a focus on positive consequences instead of health risks...|$|E
40|$|Life {{insurers}} typically grant policyholders a surrender option. We {{demonstrate that}} the resulting <b>lapse</b> <b>risk</b> could materialise {{in the form of}} a "policyholder run" if interest rates were to increase sharply. An inverse stress test based on a unique set of regulatory panel data suggests that German life insurers have become less resistant to an upward interest rate shock in the course of the financial and sovereign debt crisis from 2007 to 2011. Despite the challenges presented by the low-interestrate environment, the situation has not deteriorated since then. In light of the quantitative easing (QE) of monetary policy in the euro area, life insurers may find it difficult to continue this positive trend...|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the sub-prime crisis of 2008, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority issued the Solvency II directive, aiming at {{replacing}} the obsolete Solvency I framework by 2016. Among the quantitative requirements of Solvency II, a measure for an insurance firms solvency risk, the solvency risk capital, is found. It aims at establishing the amount of equity the company needs to hold to be able to meet its insurance obligations with a probability of 0. 995 over the coming year. The SCR of a company is essentially built up by the SCR induced by a set of quantifiable risks. Among these, risks originating from the take up rate of contractual options, <b>lapse</b> <b>risks,</b> are included. In this thesis, the contractual options of a life insurer have been identified and risk factors aiming at capturing the risks arising are suggested. It has been concluded that a risk factor estimating the size of mass transfer events captures the risk arising through the resulting rescaling of the balance sheet. Further, a risk factor modeling the deviation of the Company's assumption for the yearly transfer rate is introduced to capture the risks induced by the characteristics of traditional life insurance and unit-linked insurance contracts upon transfer. The risk factors are modeled in a manner to introduce co-dependence with equity returns as well as interest rates of various durations and the model parameters are estimated using statistical methods for Norwegian transfer-frequency data obtained from Finans Norge. The univariate and multivariate properties of the models are investigated in a scenario setting and it is concluded the the suggested models provide predominantly plausible results for the mass-lapse risk factors. However, the performance of the models for the risk factors aiming at capturing deviations in the transfer assumptions are questionable, why two means of increasing its validity have been proposed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of a rise in {{interest}} rate and <b>lapse</b> <b>risk</b> of endowment life insurance policies on the liquidity and solvency of life insurers. We model the book and market value balance sheet of an average German life insurer, subject to both GAAP and Solvency II regulation, featuring an existing back book of policies and an existing asset allocation calibrated by historical data. The balance sheet is then projected forward under stochastic financial markets. Lapse rates are modeled stochastically and depend on the granted guaranteed rate of return and prevailing level of interest rates. Our results suggest {{that in the case of}} a sharp increase in interest rates, policyholders sharply increase lapses and the solvency position of the insurer deteriorates in the short-run. This result is particularly driven by the interaction between a reduction in the market value of assets, large guarantees for existing policies, and a very slow adjustment of asset returns to interest rates. A sharp or gradual rise in interest rates is associated with substantial and persistent liquidity needs, that are particularly driven by lapse rates...|$|E

Da traditionelle Versicherungsprodukte weiterhin den Gro an den Best 4 nden der Lebensversicherer ausmachen, konzentrierte sich die Diskussion die Standardformel zur Berechnung des Solvenzkapitals bisher weitgehend auf ebendiese Produkte. Eine ausf Diskussion dar, wie Solvenzkapital f {{innovative}} Lebensversicherungsprodukte im Rahmen der Standardformel berechnet werden kann, ist deshalb erforderlich. Innovative {{life insurance}} {{products such as}} unit-linked life insurance, hybrid life insurance, and variable annuities are rapidly gaining popularity and becoming {{a major part of}} new business in Germany. However, since traditional life insurance products still dominate the portfolios of life insurance companies, discussions about the standard formula for determining the solvency capital requirement have focused on this type of business. Any detailed discussion on how to calculate the solvency capital requirement for innovative life insurance products within the standard formula has yet to occur. This paper brings to light some interesting facts about unit-linked business and Solvency II. The modeling of lapses is another focus of research, reflecting the increased importance of lapse risks for innovative life insurance products. Since there are strong concerns about nonlinearities between the various risks, especially between market risk and <b>lapse</b> <b>risk,</b> the paper examines this problem as well. Finally, an alternative method for calculating the net solvency capital requirement, the so-called single equivalent scenario (also referred to as the killer-scenario), is presented...|$|E
40|$|The need to {{accurately}} understand the factors underlying lapse, surrender and mortality (collectively termed ‘decrements ’ {{for the purposes}} of this paper) rates in life insurance is increasing because of (inter alia) the effect of International Accounting Principles, Solvency II and MCEV reporting. The aim of this paper is to investigate the use of Generalized Linear Models to capture empirical dependencies between risk factors and to understand the best factors to allow for in a correct calibration of <b>lapse</b> <b>risk.</b> After a brief description of theoretical aspects of Generalized Linear Models and their applications in analyzing for risk factors, we have investigated the lapse and surrender experience data of a large Italian bancassurer. The investigation covered the period from 1991 to 2007. The products concerned were life insurance savings policies, with a preponderance of single premium or recurrent single premium products. The case study results show in the specific case of the chosen Italian company the importance of policy duration, as expected, but also show the sensitivity of lapse rates to calendar year of exposure, to product class and to policyholder age. The work has been carried out by analysing only readily available risk factor data and could hence be substantially improved by a refinement of the underlying database. The results presented in this paper are to be interpreted as being work in progress, to be further refined in the weeks leading up to the AFIR conference...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} in insurance companies operations is the risk management of the reserves. Sound risk management of reserves should involve the estimation of the moments and distribution of cash flows associated with sold policies. To estimate the moments or the distribution of future cash flows, one must model stochastic decrements and stochastic discount rates explicitly. Besides, we consider an important feature of insurance policies: future cash flows may be interest-rate-sensitive. The interest rate levels or historical interest rate movements may affect future cash flows of sold policies through lapses, policy loans, or participating features embedded in the insurance contract. We identify three risk factors embedded in life insurers reserves in our simulation model: mortality risk, interest rate <b>risk,</b> and <b>lapse</b> rate <b>risk.</b> We derive the mortality risk to estimate the reserve from the variances of mortality rates. We choose a term structure to estimate the reserve from th [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Women {{who have}} immigrated, {{as well as}} teh {{questions}} of ethnicity and multiculturalism have been invisible in mainstream feminist research in Sweden. In {{the context of the}} international feminist debate, however, these issues are gaining high priority. For some time now the importance of pursuing politics of recognition of cultural differences hu been on the agenda. But now the debate is turning towards a critical examination of inherent traps. The article examines the problematic of cultural essentialism - a discursive terrain shared by Feminism and Multiculturalism. Multicultural policies and politics of recognition risk reducing social inequalities to cultural differences and thereby promoting the social exclusion of ethnic minorities. If “recognition” is of an oppositional “other”, and if it fails to acknowledge that identities are hybrid and composite, it <b>risks</b> <b>lapsing</b> into cultural essentialism. In order to counter culturalism. feminists need, it is maintained, to develop a conception of social citizenship which links citizenship to issues of social rights as well as the exigenc’es of a transethnic dialogue and politics of solidarity...|$|R
40|$|Background: Ultraviolet light {{exposure}} has a pathogenic {{effect on the}} development of skin cancer, whose prevalence increases worldwide. In Chile {{and the rest of the}} world, preventive educational campaigns are carried out to change high risk sun exposure behaviors. Aim: To study the behavior of the Chilean population towards skin cancer prevention and to identify erroneous preventive practices and concepts. Material and methods: A survey containing 17 questions about sun exposure behaviors, photoprotective measures and knowledge about ultraviolet radiation and skin cancer was used. It was applied during January and February 2004, to 1, 143 subjects (mean age 30 years, 409 males), taking vacations in beach resorts in Chile. Results: The hours of higher sun exposure ranged from 12 AM to 4 PM. Thirty seven percent of subjects were exposed more than 2 hours during this high <b>risk</b> <b>lapse.</b> Women and subjects aged less than 25 years were those with the riskiest behaviors. Fifty four percent used some type of photoprotection and 50 % used ocular protection. Seventy percent used creams with sun screen and 74 % used a sun protection factor higher than 15. Seventy percent applied the sun screen as recommended. Thirty eight percent had at least one sun burn in the last two years. More than 90 % of subjects were aware of the relationship between sun exposure and skin cancer but 60 % did not know the hours of higher ultraviolet radiation. The information about sun exposure was obtained from television in 57 % of surveyed individuals. Conclusions: More educational campaigns about the risk of sun exposure are needed to reduce risky behaviors in the Chilean populatio...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{proposes a}} new {{methodology}} {{to model the}} <b>lapse</b> <b>risk</b> in life insurance by integrating the dynamic aspects of policyholders’ behaviors and the dependency of the lapse intensity on macroeconomic conditions. Our approach, suitable to stable economic regimes as well as stress scenarios, introduces a mathematical framework where the lapse intensity follows a dynamic contagion process, see [Dassios A. and Zhao H. (2011) : A dynamic contagion process, Advances in Applied Probability, Vol. 43 : 3, p. 814 – 846]. This allows to capture both contagion and correlation potentially arising among insureds’ behaviors. In this framework, an external market driven jump component drives the lapse intensity process depending on the interest rate trajectory: when the spread between the market interest rates and the contractual crediting rate crosses a given threshold, the insurer is likely to experience more surrenders. A log-normal dynamic for the forward rates is introduced to build trajectories of an observable market variable and mimic {{the effect of a}} macroeconomic triggering event based on interest rates on the lapse in- tensity. Contrary to previous works, our shot-noise intensity is not constant and the resulting intensity process is not Markovian. Closed-form expressions and analytic sensitivities for the moments of the lapse intensity are provided, showing how lapses can be affected by massive copycat behaviors. Further analyses are then conducted to illustrate how the mean risk varies depending on the model’s parameters, while a simulation study compares our results with those obtained using standard practices. The numerical outputs highlight a potential misestimation of the expected number of lapses under extreme scenarios when using classical stress testing methodologies...|$|E
