[...] He {{described}} the large moth's colors [...] "of amazing distinction, black, grey, cloudy white tinged with carmine or vaguely shading off into olive green." [...] Behind the moth is a background of <b>Lords-and-Ladies.</b> The size of the moth and plants in the background pull the spectator into the work. [...] The colors are vivid, consistent with Van Gogh's passion and emotional intensity. [...] Van Gogh Museum's title for this work is Emperor Moth.|$|E

60|$|Melbury {{mounted on}} the other side, and they drove on out of the grove, their wheels silently {{crushing}} delicate-patterned mosses, hyacinths, primroses, <b>lords-and-ladies,</b> and other strange and ordinary plants, and cracking up little sticks that lay across the track. Their way homeward ran along {{the crest of a}} lofty hill, whence on the right they beheld a wide valley, differing both in feature and atmosphere from that of the Hintock precincts. It was the cider country, which met the woodland district on the axis of this hill. Over the vale the air was blue as sapphire--such a blue as outside that apple-valley was never seen. Under the blue the orchards were in a blaze of bloom, some of the richly flowered trees running almost up to where they drove along. Over a gate which opened down the incline a man leaned on his arms, regarding this fair promise so intently that he did not observe their passing.|$|E
60|$|Above all things, we don't {{want to be}} flayed alive. So {{the kinds}} of tastes {{discriminated}} by {{the tip of the}} tongue are the pungent, like pepper, cayenne and mustard; the astringent, like borax and alum; the alkaline, like soda and potash; the acid, like vinegar and green fruit; and the saline, like salt and ammonia. Almost all the bodies likely to give rise to such tastes (or, more correctly, sensations of touch in the tongue) are obviously unwholesome and destructive in their character, at least when taken in large quantities. Nobody wishes to drink nitric acid by the quart. The first business of this part of the tongue is, therefore, to warn us emphatically against caustic substances and corrosive acids, against vitriol and kerosene, spirits of wine and ether, capsicums and burning leaves or roots, such as those of the common English <b>lords-and-ladies.</b> Things of this sort are immediately destructive to the very tissues of the tongue and palate; if taken incautiously in too large doses, they burn the skin off the roof of the mouth; and when swallowed they play havoc, of course, with our internal arrangements. It is highly advisable, therefore, to have an immediate warning of these extremely dangerous substances, at the very outset of our feeding apparatus.|$|E

There are invertebrates such as stag beetles, frogs, toads and newts. Shade-tolerant plants include enchanter's-nightshade, <b>lords-and-ladies</b> and wood avens.|$|E
50|$|Arum italicum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} herbaceous perennial plant in the family Araceae, also known as Italian arum and Italian <b>lords-and-ladies.</b> It is native to the Mediterranean region (southern Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East) plus Great Britain, the Netherlands, Crimea, Caucasus, Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Azores. It is also naturalized in Argentina and in scattered locations in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|A. maculatum is {{also known}} as cuckoo pint or {{cuckoo-pint}} in the British Isles and is named thus in Nicholas Culpepers' famous 17th-century herbal. This is a name it shares with Arum italicum (Italian <b>lords-and-ladies)</b> - the other native British Arum. [...] "Pint" [...] is a shortening of the word [...] "pintle", meaning penis, derived from the shape of the spadix. The euphemistic shortening has been traced to Turner in 1551.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{a colony}} of Arum italicum ssp. italicum (Italian <b>lords-and-ladies</b> or late cuckoopint) at [...] (TQ8353411464) close {{to the bottom of}} the steps leading from Victoria Avenue into Speckled Wood. It is {{distinct}} from ordinary cuckoopint as the leaves appear in the autumn. They are plain green in this British form and without the whitish veins of some more popular garden varieties from abroad and which are usually encountered as throw-outs.|$|E
5000|$|Arum maculatum is {{a common}} {{woodland}} plant species of the Araceae family. It is widespread across most of Europe, as well as Turkey and the Caucasus. It is known by an abundance of common names including snakeshead, adder's root, arum, wild arum, arum lily, <b>lords-and-ladies,</b> devils and angels, cows and bulls, cuckoo-pint, Adam and Eve, bobbins, naked girls, naked boys, starch-root, wake robin, friar's cowl, sonsie-give-us-your-hand, jack in the pulpit and cheese and toast. The name [...] "lords-and-ladies" [...] and other gender-related names refer to the plant's likeness to male and female genitalia symbolising copulation.|$|E

50|$|The dune soil is {{calcareous}} {{because of}} the high percentage of seashell fragments which leads to a flora with lime-loving plants that are otherwise rare in Cornwall. The flora also includes at least sixty-six species of moss, making it one of richest sites in Cornwall. A number of rare plant species have been recorded on the site, these include Babington's leek (Allium babingtonii), brackish water buttercup (Ranunculus baudotii), Cornish gentian (Gentianella anglica subsp. cornubiensis), fragrant evening-primrose (Oenothera stricta), Italian <b>lords-and-ladies</b> (Arum italicum), Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica), shore-dock (Rumex rupestris), slender spike rush (Eleocharis acicularis), variegated horsetail (Equisetum variegatum) and wild leek (Allium ampeloprasum). Due to its importance as a site for lichens and rare plant species, Plantlife has designated the dunes an Important Plant Area.|$|E
