40|$|Presents {{the results}} of {{statistical}} analyses identified by the expert diagnostics of defects of the self-propelled <b>lifting</b> <b>jib</b> cranes, spent a normative term of exploitation. The greatest number of defects associated with the destruction and dete-rioration of structural elements, the occurrence of fatigue cracks and {{a violation of the}} conditions of operation of the equipment. The greatest number of defects occurs in the hydraulic system of cranes, the rope-block system, and rarely in steel structures. To conduct risk analysis of self-propelled jib cranes in case of insufficient information, proposed the method of expert estimations. It allows {{to assess the impact of}} potential defects on self-propelled jib cranes on the value of the economic damage of the crane and moving cargo and the value of the traumatic exposure on men. The proposed list of possible defects self-propelled <b>lifting</b> <b>jib</b> cranes and a checklist of questions about the degree of influence of these defects. Proposed calculated dependences to the approximate calculation of the magnitude of technical risk in the opera-tion of self-propelled jib cranes. The results of statistical analysis of expert estimations for each possible defect and per-formed their ranking in terms of impact on the magnitude of the economic damage of the crane and moving loads, the value of the traumatic exposure. Was calculated the value of technical risk for the surveyed taps...|$|E
50|$|Post-war the Matador {{was found}} in {{civilian}} use as a recovery truck, a showman's vehicle, and general contractor use. It was also useful for forestry work because of its good off-road performance. When used as a bus fleet recovery truck, many were fitted with <b>lifting</b> <b>jibs</b> for suspended towing and re-bodied with semi-enclosed bodies, often based on bodywork from scrapped buses.|$|R

In Four-column limb lattice jib {{structure}} {{system as}} the research object, considering {{the structure and}} mechanical characteristics, combining with the allowable stress method, from the failure mode of static strength, stiffness, overall stability and local stability to build lattice jib structure system reliability failure criterion. Based {{on the influence of}} parameter perturbation calculation of four-column limb lattice jib structure system, get the length of the <b>jib,</b> <b>lifting</b> weight, <b>jib</b> elevation, hoisting load bearing point offset, the proportion of wind environment on the influence of different failure modes and failure change law, as the main failure mode of the decision to provide the basis and methods...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to developa novel robust {{controller}} based on sliding mode control technique for the hydraulic servo system with flexible load and for a flexible manipulator with the <b>lift</b> and <b>jib</b> hydraulic actuators. For the purpose of general control design, a dynamic model is derived describing the principle physical behavior for both the hydraulic servo system and the flexible hydraulic manipulator. The mechanism of hydraulic servo systems is described by basic mathematical equations of fluid powersystems and the dynamics of flexible manipulator is modeled by the assumed modemethod. The controller is constructed so as to track desired trajectories in the presence of model imprecision. Experimental and simulation results demonstratethat sliding mode control has benefits which can be used to guarantee stabilityin uncertain systems and improve the system performance and load tolerance...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "hammerhead", or giant cantilever, crane is a fixed-jib crane {{consisting}} of a steel-braced tower on which revolves a large, horizontal, double cantilever; the forward part of this cantilever or <b>jib</b> carries the <b>lifting</b> trolley, the <b>jib</b> is extended backwards in order to form a support for the machinery and counterbalancing weight. In addition to the motions of lifting and revolving, there is provided a so-called [...] "racking" [...] motion, by which the lifting trolley, with the load suspended, can be moved in and out along the jib without altering {{the level of the}} load. Such horizontal movement of the load is a marked feature of later crane design. These cranes are generally constructed in large sizes and can weigh up to 350 tons.|$|R
