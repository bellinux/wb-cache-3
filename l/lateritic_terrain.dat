40|$|It is a known {{fact that}} {{no part of the}} earth surface is free from threat. It applies to Birbhum District, West Bengal, Indian <b>Lateritic</b> <b>Terrain</b> also. The {{existing}} terrain is characterized by mainly climatogenetic processes. Though the impact of climate change is vital in the shaping of the lesser topographies in the study-area. The study-area is characterized by micro landforms e. g. rills, gullies, water falls, terraces, gorges type features and limestone topographic type features. The denudational processes are very significant in the area in general but the differential erosion is evident in particular. It resembles the topographies with the African and the Brazillian Highlands. This paper interprets the rill and gully erosion risk in the <b>lateritic</b> <b>terrain</b> and their consequences in regional sustainable development and environmental managemen...|$|E
30|$|The {{climate of}} Ranchi {{district}} is a subtropical climate. This {{is characterized by}} hot summer season from March to May and well-distributed rainfall during southwest monsoon season from June to October. Ranchi district has varied hydrogeological characteristics and hence the groundwater potential differs from one location to another. The three-fourth of the district area is underlain by Chotanagpur granite gneiss of pre-Cambrian age (CGWB 2009). In two blocks (Ratu and Bero) thick lateritic capping is placed above granite gneiss. A big patch of older alluvium exists in Mandar block and limestone rock exists in northernmost portion of Burmu block. The northernmost and southernmost parts of the district are mainly covered with hillocks and forests. In general, the altitude of the area varies from 500 to 700  m above mean sea level, {{but there are many}} hillocks through the district having altitude more than 700  m above mean sea level. Two types of aquifers (Weathered aquifer and fractured aquifers) exist in the study area. Thickness of weathered aquifers varies from 10 to 25  m in granite terrain and 30 to 60  m in <b>lateritic</b> <b>terrain.</b> In weathered aquifers groundwater occurs in unconfined condition, while in fractured aquifer groundwater occurs in semi-confined to confined conditions.|$|E
40|$|The rivers {{flowing through}} the Amazon Basin are both {{physically}} and chemically heterogeneous. Through detailed geo-chemical analyses, variability is shown to be primarily controlled by both substrate lithology in the source region and soil geochemistry in the erosional regime. The solute-rich waters of the Rio Solimres reflect the drainage from the Andes Mountains and the fertility of the varzea. In contrast, the solute-deficient waters of the Rio Negro reflect he infertility of the <b>lateritic</b> and podsolitic <b>terrains</b> of the Central Amazon. Rivers {{flowing through the}} Precambrian Shield have an inter-mediate composition. Such observations suggest hat {{it is possible to}} classify the chemical composition of Amazonian rivers according to the soil types in their catchment regions and vice versa. These findings have profound implications for using water chemistry as an indicator of the agricultural and mineral potential of a region. Results from this study also confirm that precipitation isa significant source of major cations and trace metals to solute-deficient river systems uch as the Rio Negro. 1...|$|R
40|$|Low income urban {{communities}} across Africa depend on local shallow, often highly contaminated, groundwater sources for drinking and domestic use {{as well as}} larger municipal supplies extracting groundwater from deeper within the aquifer system where these are available and affordable. Rapid lateral and vertical pathways in the subsurface, often only active for limited periods e. g. during high water table conditions, can lead to rapid deterioration of groundwater quality. Sanitary risk assessments and quantification of basic water quality indicators such thermotolerant coliforms are often used as part of water point vulnerability assessments in urban and peri-urban water supplies in Africa. While there have been huge advances {{in the development of}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques in recent years for amplifying microbial DNA, these techniques have not been used to date for quantifying specific pathogenic strains of bacteria in groundwaters in Africa. In this paper we present results from a pilot study using qPCR techniques {{for the first time to}} quantify the occurrence of 26 specific pathogenic strains in water supplies in Kabwe, Zambia. Pathogen occurrence is assessed in both shallow and deep groundwater points during both the wet and dry season in a vulnerable dolomite aquifer system. Multiple pathogens were revealed within the groundwater system including Vibrio cholera and Salmonella enterica. This technique shows great potential for tracking specific pathogens, fingerprinting sources of pathogens in groundwater sources and assessing rapid shallow pathways in widespread vulnerable settings in Africa, and elsewhere, such as those found in <b>lateritic</b> or karstic <b>terrains...</b>|$|R
