Rather than wait, brigade headquarters, the KOSB and 156 Para chose to head up and over the railway embankment on foot. Once south of the railway <b>line</b> <b>Support</b> and 'B' Company, 156 Para became mixed up with 10 Para making towards Wolfheze, while the battalion headquarters and other two companies headed further south. At 20:30 divisional headquarters issued orders for all units to fall back on a position around the Hartenstein Hotel in Oosterbeek. The Germans continued to pressure 4th Parachute Brigade and 10 Para dug in around Wolfheze. 156 Para to their south came under constant attack leading to fighting at close quarters throughout the night and into the next morning.|$|E

25|$|By {{the turn}} of the century it had become evident that the Østfold Line was undermentioned. It was the main railway heading south to Continental Europe and there was a steady demand that the <b>line</b> <b>support</b> faster {{passenger}} services and heavier freight trains. This resulted in a 1910 decision to upgrade all bridges along the line to support a heavier weight norm. The work was initially planned to be completed by 1919. The breakout of the First World War and later lack of funding delayed the plans with more than a decade. The last major work was the construction of a new bridge over Sarpefossen. While other bridges were needed to be strengthened, with was not a viable option for the Sarp Bridge. The first plans for a new bridge were completed in 1913, but the break-out of the war place new project on hold. Planning was not taken up again before in 1922.|$|E

The other eight are subsidiary subroutines. The parameters of the conductors (homogenous or non-homogenous) are found by DPMPN and DPMPH. The physical-mechanical properties of the conductor are calculated using PMPL. The specific loadings are determined by RLOLC. The sag-tension calculations are prepared by subroutines CSCT, CSOP and SEQS. Subroutine FSPCB is for calculation of forces due to broken conductor at suspension support in the section. The elaborated programmes are written in FORTRAN 90 and adopted for personal computer...|$|R

500|$|The {{battalion}} saw {{its first}} serious action during the Battle of Mouquet Farm in mid-August. During the battle, the 50th Battalion suffered 414 casualties, {{largely from the}} heavy German artillery bombardment. On 14 August, Jensen had joined the casualty lists, hit in the left shoulder by a piece of shrapnel. He was evacuated to the United Kingdom and admitted to Graylingwell War Hospital in Chichester, West Sussex. While in the United Kingdom, {{he was charged with}} more disciplinary infractions in September, December and January, on one occasion being sentenced to 28 days field punishment for missing the troop train to return to France, and on another serving 12 days detention for being absent without leave. As a consequence, he did not rejoin his unit until 28 January 1917. The 50th Battalion continued to rotate through front <b>line,</b> <b>support</b> and reserve positions, and underwent training in rear areas. The battalion was also involved in pursuing the Germans as they withdrew to the Hindenburg Line of fortifications. On 2 April, the 13th Brigade attacked the Hindenburg Outpost Line at Noreuil. The attack consisted of the 51st Battalion attacking the village from the north, and the 50th Battalion from the south. During this assault, which was preceded by a weak artillery barrage, the 50th Battalion suffered extraordinary difficulties, and the centre company, to which Jensen belonged, was forced to detach a party of bombers to deal with a strong German post that was holding out between their company and the one on their right. Jensen was a member of this party. It was during the reduction of this post that Jensen's actions resulted in a recommendation for the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry {{in the face of the}} enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. The recommendation read: ...|$|E

During the fighting for Noreuil, the 50th Battalion suffered 360 casualties, including 95 dead, and captured 70 Germans, nearly {{all of whom were}} captured by Jensen. On 4 April, Jensen was promoted to lance corporal. His award of the Victoria Cross appeared in The London Gazette on 8 June, by which time the 50th Battalion was involved in the Battle of Messines, during which the battalion suffered 149 casualties. After being relieved, the battalion continued its rotation through front <b>line,</b> <b>support</b> and reserve positions. In July, Jensen was [...] temporarily promoted to corporal and transferred to the 13th Training Battalion at Codford in the United Kingdom as an instructor. During his time in the United Kingdom, he was entertained by Danish residents of Kingston upon Hull. After another disciplinary infringement, he left the United Kingdom to return to France, rejoining his battalion on 6 October. He was temporarily promoted to sergeant in early November, and the battalion went through the winter of 1917/1918 rotating through the front line. In late March 1918, the battalion left its rest area and along with many other Australian units was quickly deployed to meet the German Spring Offensive south of the River Ancre. On 5 April, the battalion took up positions at Dernancourt and there contributed to the defeat of the [...] "largest German attack mounted against Australian troops during the war". This was followed by a move to the Villers-Bretonneux sector, where, on 25 April the battalion was part of the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux which drove the Germans from that village, at a cost to the battalion of 254 casualties. On 5 May, Jensen was on patrol near Villers-Bretonneux when he was shot in the head. Severely wounded, he was admitted to hospital in France, and on 18 May was evacuated to the United Kingdom, where he was admitted to the Richmond Military Hospital in Surrey.|$|E

More reliefs took place with the 22nd and 26th Canadian battalions replacing the 20th and 19th Canadian battalions. On 12 April, Plumer and Turner decided to concentrate on improving the front line; the frequent battalion reliefs were necessary due to fatigue and lack of sleep under constant bombardment, with no cover amidst mud and waterlogged shell holes. The Germans made occasional bomb attacks, intermittently bombarded the British lines during the day and fired Shrapnel shell bombardments at night, to catch working parties. During the night of [...] the 24th Canadian Battalion relieved the 25th and an officer crawled round the craters, reporting that the four along the old German front line were occupied.

Plans for more attacks were cancelled and on the night of [...] the 5th Canadian Brigade was relieved by the 6th Canadian Brigade.

40|$|In this paper, a {{computationally}} {{efficient and}} highly accurate numerical method is proposed {{to analyze the}} vibrations of symmetrically laminated rectangular composite plates with intermediate <b>line</b> <b>supports.</b> A set of admissible functions are developed from the static solutions of a beam with intermediate point supports under a series of sinusoidal loads, in which the beam may {{be considered to be}} a unit width strip taken from the plate in a direction parallel to the edges of the plate. In addition to satisfying both the geometric boundary conditions of the plate and the zero deflection conditions at the <b>line</b> <b>supports,</b> this set of static beam functions, being different from the existing admissible functions, can also properly describe the discontinuity of the shear forces at the <b>line</b> <b>supports,</b> so that more accurate results can be expected for the dynamic analysis of laminated rectangular plates with intermediate <b>line</b> <b>supports.</b> The governing eigenfrequency equation of the plates is derived by using the Rayleigh-Ritz approach. Several test problems are solved to demonstrate the accuracy and the convergency of the proposed method. The effects of the location and number of <b>line</b> <b>supports,</b> the material properties, the number of layers and the fiber orientations on the vibration behavior of the plates are studied in detail. Some data known for the first time are given and can serve as the benchmark for future research on the aforementioned problem. Moreover, two examples of the dynamic responses of line-supported laminated rectangular plates are also given as an extending application of the present method. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
