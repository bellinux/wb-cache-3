Helmet with forced filtering air supply (PAPR) reduces the concentration of dust in half. The expected decrease in dust concentration of the two types of respirators are 10 and 25 respectively. In subsequent publications of CDC (on the subject of reducing the dust content in underground mining) RPE are not mentioned at all.|$|E
25|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{deposits of}} nahcolite (NaHCO3) {{are found in}} the Eocene-age (55.8–33.9 Mya) Green River Formation, Piceance Basin in Colorado. Nahcolite was deposited as beds during periods of high evaporation in the basin. It is commercially mined using common underground mining techniques such as bore, drum, and <b>longwall</b> mining in a fashion very similar to coal mining. A very small portion is also obtained using in situ leach techniques involving dissolution of the nahcolite by heated water pumped through the nahcolite beds that have previously been mined using the aforementioned techniques. It is then reconstituted through a natural cooling crystallization process. Currently only Tronox (formerly FMC) in the Green River Wyoming basin has successfully commercially solution mined the product.|$|E

25|$|Improvements in mining methods (e.g. <b>longwall</b> mining), {{hazardous}} gas monitoring (such as safety-lamps or {{more modern}} electronic gas monitors), gas drainage, electrical equipment, and ventilation have reduced {{many of the}} risks of rock falls, explosions, and unhealthy air quality. Gases released during the mining process can be recovered to generate electricity and improve worker safety with gas engines. Another innovation {{in recent years is}} the use of closed circuit escape respirators, respirators that contain oxygen for situations where mine ventilation is compromised. Statistical analyses performed by the US Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) show that between 1990 and 2004, the industry cut the rate of injuries by more than half and fatalities by two-thirds. However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, even in 2006, mining remained the second most dangerous occupation in America, when measured by fatality rate. However, these numbers include all mining, with oil and gas mining contributing the majority of fatalities; coal mining resulted in only 47 fatalities that year.|$|E
500|$|A new {{headgear}} {{and winding}} engine were {{built at the}} Deep pit shaft; ventilation was by means of two axial-type fans installed in an underground chamber. After 1947 a [...] tunnel [...] below ground level was driven to the Stuart Street Power Station, to provide coal direct from the colliery. A conveyor within the tunnel delivered 200 long tons (224 short tons) of small coal an hour to the power station's bunker. Most of the developments begun by Manchester Collieries were completed after nationalisation in 1947 by the National Coal Board (NCB). After modernisation and reconstruction, coal was extracted by <b>longwall</b> mining using coal-cutting machinery and conveyors. This type of mining creates a void or goaf into which the roof is allowed to collapse. At Bradford, which had no spoil heap, the goaf was infilled with spoil or waste. As there was insufficient spoil to fill the void, some was brought from other pits. The NCB incorporated the takes, or coal reserves, of Moston and Ashton Moss Collieries into the redeveloped Bradford Colliery. Moston was closed, but the shafts of Ashton Moss were retained for winding men and equipment.|$|E

The heights of this zone have been extended from north east to south west, which are correspondent with tectonic structure of eastern Alborz. This mineral zone has cut by extending faults of various slips. The function of such discontinuities in this zone led to formation of more than 12 <b>longwalls</b> for extracting mineral materials.

30|$|Destressing techniques, {{including}} drilling, water infusion, hydrofracturing, and blasting, have occasionally {{been used}} to reduce the burst risk (Varley and Whyatt 2008; Maleki et al. 2011). While some of these techniques are used routinely in German mines (Baltz and Hucke 2008), their performance in the US has been mixed. The difficulties of identifying optimum distressing times and ability to assess the effectiveness of each destressing attempt, the limited time available for face destressing (to avoid production delays) and adverse drilling conditions reduced the overall success of the efforts.

The minimising of {{the sum of the}} squared differences between the average and forecasted subsidence, using J.

The parameter values of this formula have been chosen in order to match forecasted subsidence with measured ones. The average values of inclinations have been calculated on the basis of approximated values of observed subsidence. It has been shown that by doing this the average values of extreme measured inclinations can be obtained in almost the same way as extreme observed inclinations.

40|$|SAR Interferometry is {{a method}} that allows to measure land {{subsidence}} on radar coherent areas with high precision. This method can measure displacements of the terrain surface smaller than one centimeter.

The A 4 motorway partly is located in the Upper Silesian, Poland. This area is characteristic because it is a region where underground black coal exploitation is conducted. For such types of mining, huge terrain surface deformations are very common [1]. The coal mining continued even during the construction of motorway.

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{specifically}} measured and documented the large-scale loading behavior and durability of ventilation stoppings to mining induced movements, particularly from <b>longwalls.</b> Ventilation stoppings are more commonly {{the concern of}} ventilation engineers, and ventilation stopping response to ground movement has only been documented in an incidental manner. This paper presents the investigations of underground measurements that have been conducted to determine the loading response of stoppings constructed from lightweight aggregate concrete masonry units (CMU). These investigations have produced some interesting results that may prove beneficial, not only for developing and assessing alternative stopping construction techniques, but also for designing and selecting standard construction methods for use in varying mining conditions. For instance, the interface friction that results from wedging a CMU stopping during construction plays a substantial role {{in its ability to}} resist both lateral and vertical loads. Although they are not intended for ground support, the study showed that block stoppings can resist vertical loads of at least 2, 700 to 3, 000 kN. Asymmetric loading of a stopping may result in localized failure of blocks within a stopping, which, depending on the severity, can be a precursor of impending stopping failure. In addition to measurement results and implications, the paper will also present details of field measurement methods used to assess stopping response. Stopping stiffness and material strength characteristics will also be presented...|$|R

Concrete blocks were released from the top of the highwall. Block sizes were defined according to records of rockfall events and results of polyhedral modelling of the highwall. The tests were carried out on two different sections of the highwall: the first section was draped with a netting protection system whereas the second section had no protection system (net) installed. In the first section, the blocks were released behind the net in order to be able to investigate the effect of the net on the block trajectory and the energy dissipation. Direct comparison was made with the section where no net interfered with the rockfall. The tests were repeated several times and were recorded by using high speed cameras. Analysis of the rockfall images and videos allowed for the gathering of information on the motion type, trajectories, arrest zones and potential impacting energy. Particular emphasis was given to the analysis of the residual hazard once a protection system is in place. This is of particular importance for giving recommendations for optimising the protection system which then helps to provide greater confidence in the safety of portal installations...|$|R
