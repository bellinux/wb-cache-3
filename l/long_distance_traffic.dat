5|$|Reading {{was a major}} {{staging point}} on the old Bath Road (A4) from London to Avonmouth, near Bristol. This road still carries local traffic, but has now been {{replaced}} for <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>traffic</b> by the M4 motorway, which closely skirts the borough and serves it with three junctions, J10-J12. Other main roads serving Reading include the A33, A327, A329, A4074 and A4155. Within Reading there is the Inner Distribution Road (IDR), a ring road for local traffic. The IDR is linked with the M4 by the A33 relief road. National Express Coaches run out of Reading Coachway, at Junction 12 of the M4. The Thames is crossed by both Reading and Caversham road bridges, while several road bridges cross the Kennet, the oldest surviving {{one of which is}} High Bridge.|$|E
25|$|On 21 March 2015, MTR began {{operating}} fast <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>traffic</b> between Stockholm and Gothenburg with own {{ticket sales}} using {{the brand name}} MTR Express. It has purchased six Stadler Flirt electric multiple units.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{competition}} for <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>traffic</b> {{was introduced by}} Megabus, {{a subsidiary of the}} large UK bus operating company Stagecoach. This company operates cheap services aimed at students and the like, which must be booked in advance on the internet.|$|E
25|$|Electrification of the West Coast Main Line {{throughout}} between London, Birmingham and Glasgow encouraged {{concentration of}} <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> on the Caledonian main line, and {{decline of the}} G route. The Waverley Route closed in 1969.|$|R
50|$|There is {{continuing}} {{work on the}} adequacy of the station to handle S-Bahn, <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> and regional <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
50|$|Segments of Highway 1 {{range from}} a rural two-lane road to an urban freeway. Because of the former, <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> thru <b>traffic</b> {{traveling}} between the coastal metropolitan areas are instead advised to use faster routes such as US 101 or I-5.|$|R
25|$|Some A {{roads are}} {{designated}} trunk roads, which implies that central government rather than local government has responsibility for them. A more recent classification {{is that of}} primary routes, the category of recommended routes for <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>traffic.</b> Primary routes include both trunk and non-trunk roads.|$|E
25|$|Work to {{separate}} local and <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>traffic</b> at J4 {{was completed in}} 2007, including a new dedicated left-turn slip lane between the A404 Marlow Bypass and the Oxford-bound M40; additional lanes on the slip roads entering the roundabout; an additional lane between the A404 Marlow Hill and the London-bound M40; and a five-lane cross link between the M40 and the A404(S).|$|E
25|$|The station {{features}} nine platform tracks, {{of which}} seven {{are in the}} station hall. In the hall, two tracks serve as through tracks for freight traffic. The station is electrified since 1964 and has been thoroughly modernised during the late 1990s. Both the passenger and mail subways, {{which used to be}} separate, were joined together and the station's subway now features a rich selection of shops and food halls, akin to a shopping mall. The platforms have been partly modernised as well (most notably platforms 5 and 6, which carry most of the southbound <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>traffic),</b> and lifts have been put in.|$|E
50|$|For <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> through <b>traffic</b> {{this route}} never {{received}} substantial use, although the Great Central Railway (who acquired the WMCQR in 1897) did run some holiday trains south to Newtown, although these {{then proceeded to}} Aberystwyth rather than to South Wales as originally envisaged.|$|R
5000|$|The last {{in service}} was No. 1685, which ran until 1934. Along with the 1076 class, they were {{initially}} used on <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> mineral <b>traffic</b> in the Southern Division of the GWR. To quote le Fleming, [...] "they were always rather misfits", but [...] "...their distinctive features were welcomed by enthusiasts {{if not by}} the Running Dept." ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractViroids, small RNA {{pathogens}} {{capable of}} infecting flowering plants, coexist {{in the field}} with parasitic plants that infest many crops. The ability of viroids to be exchanged between host and parasitic plants and spread in the latter {{has not yet been}} investigated. We studied the interaction between the Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) and Branched bromrape (Orobanche ramosa) using the tomato, Solanum lycopersicon, as a common host. We report the <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>trafficking</b> of PSTVd RNA via the phloem from tomato to O. ramosa, but not vice versa. Furthermore, we identify O. ramosa as a novel host with the ability to facilitate the replication and processing of PSTVd. Finally, molecular variants of PSTVd with single nucleotide substitutions that replicate with different efficiencies in tomato were isolated from O. ramosa...|$|R
500|$|As a 1930s road {{construction}} project, the bypass {{was built to}} then-contemporary standards, including at-grade crossings at Bar End and at Hockley. As time progressed, the bypass {{became more and more}} of a bottleneck as roads around it were improved to higher standards, particularly after the opening of the A33 Chandler's Ford Bypass in 1968 and the A34 King's Worthy Link the following year, which meant all <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>traffic,</b> as opposed to merely that from London to Southampton, was using the bypass. Morgan Morgan-Giles described the bypass as [...] "utterly inadequate and dangerous, as everybody who lives in or near Winchester will agree. The accident figures are appalling. Therefore, a new motorway somewhere to relieve the traffic is urgently needed." [...] The crossing at Bar End was grade separated in 1973, but the junction at Hockley remained a key point of congestion.|$|E
500|$|At busy {{times there}} was {{significant}} delay at the payment booths when these existed. There are numerous junctions {{on either side}} of the crossing, and because it is not under motorway restrictions, a high proportion of local traffic mixes with <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>traffic,</b> for example travelling from the North and Midlands onwards to Continental Europe. In 2004, a BBC survey reported that the crossing was [...] "the most stressful section of the M25" [...] while in 2009, the crossing was listed in a Royal Automobile Club report as the fourth most congested road in Britain. Though Highways England have reported greatly improved journey times since automatic charging was introduced, Gareth Johnson MP claims otherwise and has insisted that the Lower Thames Crossing, along with improved signing around Dartford, are better options to reduce congestion. In 2015, he said the crossing was Britain's worst stretch of motorway.|$|E
2500|$|An {{underground}} railway {{line for}} Munich was first proposed in 1928 {{in a report}} on the [...] "relocation of traffic centres". An underground route would allow [...] "direct <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>traffic</b> to and through the city centre".|$|E
50|$|The Caledonian Railway now {{operated}} a trunk network from Carlisle to Aberdeen. <b>Long</b> <b>distance</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> assumed greater importance, but while less prominent, goods traffic {{was a major}} activity. At {{the same time the}} rival North British Railway developed its route through Edinburgh and Dundee to Aberdeen; the final approach was over Caledonian tracks by the running powers granted by Parliament.|$|R
5000|$|The €800 million EC EUREKA Prometheus Project {{conducted}} research on autonomous vehicles from 1987 to 1995. Among its culmination points were the twin robot vehicles VITA-2 and VaMP of Daimler-Benz and Ernst Dickmanns, driving <b>long</b> <b>distances</b> in heavy <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Royal Bavarian Eastern Railway Company (Königlich privilegirte Actiengesellschaft der bayerischen Ostbahnen) or Bavarian Ostbahn {{was founded}} in 1856. Within just two decades it built an {{extensive}} railway network in the eastern Bavarian provinces of Upper Palatinate (Oberpfalz) and Lower Bavaria (Niederbayern) {{that had previously been}} largely undisturbed by the railway. Much of this network is still important for local and <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> rail <b>traffic</b> operated by the Deutsche Bahn today.|$|R
2500|$|In 1987, the Department of Transport {{proposed}} a parallel relief road to combat congestion around Manchester. It {{would have been}} restricted to <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>traffic,</b> and the current route, part of the Manchester Outer Ring Road (later the M60), used for local traffic. The proposal suggested the closure of junction13. The proposal was designated a [...] "long term" [...] improvement in 1994, and cancelled on 23 November 1995.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{successive}} {{failed attempts}} {{to build the}} southern flank of the Glasgow Inner Ring Road {{as defined by the}} Bruce Report. [...] This section of road, which is an extension of the M74, differs in route from the original Bruce proposals of the late 1940s, and was intended to funnel <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>traffic</b> from the north and south which is bound for the southern Clyde Coast and allow it to bypass the urban section of the M8. Following many years of intensive political discussion and legal battles, construction of the M74 Completion scheme began in 2008, and it opened in June 2011. [...] Early indications are that the new road has been successful in reducing traffic levels on the urban section of the M8.|$|E
2500|$|Roads in the UK are {{classified}} as M (Motorway), A, or B roads, as well as various categories of more minor roads: for internal purposes, local authorities may also use C, D and U (the letter standing for [...] "Unclassified"). Each road is given a number which is combined with the prefix, for example M40, A40 and B1110, although their informal or traditional names may still be used or heard occasionally: for instance, the Great North Road (now part of the A1) and the Great Cambridge Road (modern A10). These numbers follow a zonal system. There is no available explanation for the allocation of road numbers in Northern Ireland. The majority of the major inter-urban routes are motorways, and are designed to carry <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>traffic.</b> The next category is the A roads, which form the primary route network. A primary route is defined as: ...|$|E
50|$|Research {{continued}} through the 1930s in conjunction with Bell Telephone Laboratories (the successor to Western Electric’s research division), to use shorter wavelengths for radio transmission, this {{eventually led to the}} development of the microwave radio relay systems used to carry <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> telephone <b>traffic</b> in the latter half of the 20th century. The development of fiber-optic communications (also by Bell Labs) ended the widespread use of microwave repeaters.|$|R
50|$|By 1937-38 {{patronage}} {{had grown}} to 135,329,598 but the pattern of suburban rail travel was changing. People were living further from the inner city, and the average distance travelled by commuters changed from 9.0 km in the early 1930s to 10.4 km {{by the end of}} the decade. The Victorian Railways Commissioners established a committee in 1938 to study the impact of the increase of <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> suburban <b>traffic.</b> It consisted of three officers headed by Ashworth.|$|R
50|$|Underground {{sewerage}} {{system in this}} town is unbeatable and hence it bears the title to be a neat and clean town. Well planned streets make all the <b>long</b> <b>distances</b> calm and <b>traffic</b> free. The narrow fields are used by the pedestrians to move fast on foot to avoid traffic.|$|R

50|$|As in {{the case}} of the GWR Act passed on the same day, {{regional}} rivalries required construction to commence as simultaneously as possible, spreading resources and slowing down overall progress. Priority was subsequently given to sections that would serve cane country, as despite situations such as the Childers-Brisbane sugar <b>traffic,</b> <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> freight <b>traffic</b> was not expected to grow once lines were connected. The NCL was seen as mainly benefiting passengers, especially as bad weather could frequently disrupt coastal shipping during the cyclone season.|$|R
50|$|Bourg-en-Bresse {{station was}} opened on 1 September 1866. It is the {{starting}} point for the du Haut-Bugey line which was opened in 1876. Bourg is the administrative seat of the Ain département. The station is an important junction and consequently sees a lot of traffic. In addition to the Paris - Geneva TGV traffic using the Haut-Bugey line, there is <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> Corail <b>traffic</b> from Strasbourg to Marseille, Strasbourg to Lyon and several TER lines including the line from Bourg to Lyon through the Dombes.|$|R
50|$|Between Frankfurt West and Friedberg the two {{tracks of}} the Main-Weser Railway {{is shared by}} S-Bahn, regional, <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> and freight <b>traffic.</b> To improve operations, {{this section of the}} line is being {{upgraded}} from two to four tracks by about 2016. Planning permission for this project has already been granted in the Bad Vilbel area.|$|R

50|$|From a {{rural road}} the Road R51-7 became a {{national}} highway because after completion this Mvuma- Gweru Highway attracted <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>traffic</b> and traffic volumes substantially increased with average growth rates higher than 7%.|$|E
50|$|Around 1950, the {{extension}} of the Carl's Railway to connect with the Northeim-Ottbergen-Altenbeken line was again discussed; this would have required the construction of an approximately 530 metre-long tunnel. The unfavourable topographical conditions in Karlshafen created difficulties, however, and it was decided to cater for the north-south <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> freight <b>traffic</b> on the Warburg-Altenbeken route by construction a bypass curve at Altenbeken station to the Hamm-Warburg line.With the dieselisation of lines, passenger operations were generally carried out using diesel railbuses. At times, class V 36 diesel shunting locomotive hauled passenger trains.|$|R
50|$|The GWR {{experienced}} a substantial growth in <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> immediately before the First World War requiring a further series of fifteen locomotives {{during the first}} six months of 1914 (Swindon Lot 199). These were numbered 4046-60 and named after British princesses. They were all built with 15 in diameter cylinders and had improved boilers compared to the previous batch. They also introduced an improved four-cone vacuum ejector made necessary to improve braking on the increasingly long passenger trains. The locomotives were all withdrawn by British Railways between 1950 and 1957.|$|R
50|$|The line {{is served}} by Trenitalia {{regional}} trains between Milan and Verona and between Verona and Venice. The section from Pioltello to the Milan Cintura (belt) line is also served by trains of the S5 (and, in the future, S6) line of the Milan Suburban Railway Network. The Padua-Venice section is also used by {{the lines of the}} Metropolitan Regional Rail System of the Veneto region. <b>Long</b> <b>distance</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> {{is served by}} Trenitalia Eurostar and Cisalpino trains. The railway is also used by freight trains operated by several railway companies.|$|R
