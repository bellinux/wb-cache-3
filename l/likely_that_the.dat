5|$|Differences in songs, {{genetics}} and morphology {{suggests that the}} Azores were colonised in a single invasion in the late Pleistocene, about 100,000 years ago. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> initial colonisation was of the easternmost islands, with a subsequent spread to the central and western island groups from the western caldera of São Miguel, where both eastern and western song types are found.|$|E
5|$|Due to its location, the Church of St Peter {{is often}} {{described}} as a cemetery church. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it improbable that an ordinary village cemetery church would have an inscription by a Bulgarian tsar. In her opinion, it is more <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> church was constructed by a noble person related to the court of the Second Bulgarian Empire.|$|E

5|$|Ecgberht {{was buried}} in Winchester, as were his son, Æthelwulf, his grandson, Alfred the Great, and his great-grandson, Edward the Elder. During the ninth century, Winchester began {{to show signs of}} urbanisation, and it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{sequence}} of burials indicates that Winchester was held in high regard by the West Saxon royal line.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tonal {{lowering}} seen in {{this particular}} example {{is related to the}} low tone nasal prefix found in future tense constructions in some other Senufo languages. In fact, Supyire shows a similar phenomenon in future tense constructions with a direct object (in other future tense constructions, a low tone nasal is found).|$|E
5|$|It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{traditional}} use of narcissi for {{the treatment}} of cancer was due to the presence of isocarbostyril constituents such as narciclasine, pancratistatin and their congeners. N. poeticus contains about 0.12g of narciclasine per kg of fresh bulbs.|$|E

5|$|It {{was later}} {{claimed by the}} Nazis that Wessel also wrote the music to the song, but it was {{considered}} more <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tune was in reality adapted from a World War I German Imperial Navy song, and was probably originally a folk song. The authorship of the melody was finally determined by a German court in 1937 as not by Wessel.|$|E
5|$|Just before Najib {{spoke at}} 22:00 MYT, an {{emergency}} meeting {{was called in}} Beijing for relatives of Flight 370 passengers. Malaysia Airlines announced that Flight 370 was assumed lost with no survivors.

5|$|Most of the {{surviving}} prehistoric stone monuments on Exmoor are located on those areas of moorland outside the limits of medieval and post-medieval agriculture.

40|$|Institutions affect key {{dimensions}} {{of the political process}} –policy, stability, and conflict. The choice of institutions is thus consequential. I argue that transition modes affect the choice of institutions in predictable and systematic ways. The more balanced power is between the two main bargaining forces –regime elite and opposition– <b>the</b> <b>likelier</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resulting institutions will be pluralistic. Contrarily, the more unbalanced power is in favour of regime elites vis a vis <b>the</b> opposition, <b>the</b> <b>likelier</b> <b>that</b> institutions will be majoritarian. The argument is tested for El Salvador and Guatemala...|$|R
5|$|Quality of {{life may}} be {{significantly}} reduced, {{even in those}} people on optimum medical therapy. Many report both physical and psychological problems.

Health costs remain about double those of the normal population.|$|E
5|$|Some areas were, in fact, {{decorated}} with gold: the shields between the Ignudi and the columns between the Prophets and Sibyls.

5|$|The Life ends {{abruptly}} with no {{concluding remarks}} {{and it is}} considered <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> manuscript is an incomplete draft. Asser lived a further fifteen or sixteen years and Alfred a further six, but no events after 893 are recorded.|$|E

5|$|The gods {{involved}} in a festival also received various offerings in much larger quantities than in daily ceremonies.

5|$|The players {{acquired}} by Fletcher matured {{into one of}} the strongest teams in the league during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From 1984–85 to 1990–91, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one. However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run, largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Oilers. Although the Oilers and Flames usually finished at or {{near the top of the}} Campbell Conference, the NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in Campbell Conference finals. That same structure made it very <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have to get past the Flames or Oilers (or both) in order to make it to the conference finals. From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} often {{travels with}} small mixed flocks in winter. These flocks {{are led by}} titmice and chickadees, with nuthatches and downy woodpeckers as common attendant species. Participants in such flocks are thought to benefit in terms of foraging and predator avoidance. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> attendant species also access the information carried in the chickadees' calls and reduce their own level of vigilance accordingly.|$|E

5|$|While poorly documented, {{chemical}} communication {{is believed to}} be important to the group. Anal secretions are produced in the hindgut, and released along the posterior setae as predator deterrents In Australia, aggregations of male common blossom thrips have been observed on the petals of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis and Gossypium hirsutum; females were attracted to these groups so it seems <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> males were producing pheromones.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{international}} breed associations have been testing the F94L status of cattle registered in their herd books. The absence of F94L genes in some tested cattle {{might be a}} result of a sire or dam ancestor that had double muscling (MH) genes, or more <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> myostatin gene was the normal or wild type variant found most commonly in beef cattle. In the latter case, loss of the F94L variant will arise when grading up to purebred when base animals are not Limousins.|$|E
