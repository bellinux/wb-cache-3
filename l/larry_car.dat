The {{objective is to}} define the safe limits of coke oven battery operating conditions compatible with a long service life in terms of thermal and mechanical stresses. For this purpose a 3 D thermomechanical model of a heating wall {{taking into account the}} assembly of bricks and joints was developed with PRISME Laboratory. To build an efficient and complete model, different parameters must be taken into account: * complexity of the structure: heating walls include flues and are made of masonries with various types of bricks (with various shapes and materials). The presence of joints has a great influence on the wall behaviour since they can open in tension and close in compression; * brick and joint material behaviours: refractory materials have specific thermo-mechanical behaviours, temperature depending; * knowledge of thermo-mechanical loading: temperature field, weights of walls, roof and <b>larry</b> <b>car,</b> pre-stresses (anchoring system), lateral pressure due to coal pushing A 3 D heating wall model was developed and allows to take all these parameters into account. The model was created in order to estimate the maximal lateral pressure and to understand mechanism of joints opening. Moreover, the model is based on Fos sur Mer coking plant geometry, and particularly on the battery 3 which was instrumented. Indeed several force sensors have been placed on tie rods, load transmitters and thermocouples on different positions in the brickwork...|$|E

5000|$|The {{story begins}} with <b>Larry's</b> <b>car,</b> an old Ford LTD station wagon, stalled {{out in a}} dark alley. Suddenly the pink lights of [...] "The Universal Joint," [...] a bar, come on. Larry goes inside to call a tow truck, and tells {{bartender}} Mike his troubles. He reviews the day he just had, which ended with his getting fired after discovering his department head Niles Pender's (Hart Bochner) scheme to sell the company under the nose of its owners {{to a group of}} naive Japanese investors. He tells Mike that he wishes he'd hit that last pitch out of the park, after which Mike fixes him a drink called [...] "The Spilt Milk." [...] The Spilt Milk was a drink that gave him his wish that he hit that home run in that championship game.|$|R
5000|$|... 1968: Mario {{dropped out}} after only 2 laps {{with a bad}} piston, and {{finished}} in last place. A few minutes later, he climbed into his teammate, <b>Larry</b> Dickson's <b>car</b> to drive relief. He did not fare any better, as that car dropped out after 24 laps with another bad piston.|$|R
50|$|Big Daddy {{thinks that}} Larry and Rico are two guys his girlfriend Elise (Ashley Scott) {{has set up}} for his sale of an {{expensive}} collection of antique Indian Head pennies. The buyer is an aspiring rapper named Cool Crush Ice Killa (Terry Crews), who wants to meet Larry and Rico at a bus station with the money. They forget the coins in <b>Larry's</b> <b>car,</b> and in a panic they run from the bus station with the money, with Ice Killa chasing them. They go back to Big Daddy's, where Ice Killa, who has a great fear of dogs, is chased up a tree by Big Daddy's trained guard dog. Larry, Rico, and Big Daddy then find out that Elise and Ice Killa were trying to steal the coins. Big Daddy then asks Larry and Rico {{to work for him}} in his investment in beachfront property in Nicaragua. At the airport, they run into Dupre, whose infomercials {{turned out to be a}} scam, and is now also investing in Nicaragua.|$|R
50|$|Hispanic Racing Team was a NASCAR Busch Series team {{owned by}} Mike Vasquez, Rudy Rodriguez and former Winston Cup owner <b>Larry</b> Hedrick. The <b>cars</b> were driven by 1992 Indy 500 polesitter Roberto Guerrero, Carlos Contreras, Christian Fittipaldi, and former Busch Series {{champion}} David Green.|$|R
50|$|Cars Toons is {{a series}} of American computer-animated short films by Pixar. It {{features}} Lightning McQueen and Mater from <b>Cars.</b> <b>Larry</b> the Cable Guy reprises his role as Mater while Keith Ferguson replaces Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen (until The Radiator Springs 500 Â½ when Wilson reprises his role).|$|R
50|$|Wimmer's {{career began}} in his youth, {{when he began}} working on his uncle, <b>Larry</b> Detjens' race <b>car.</b> Detjens was a {{champion}} late model racer who competed at Slinger Super Speedway and Wisconsin International Raceway. Detjens had the Slinger Nationals race trophy named after him {{after his death in}} 1981. Wimmer would work on his brother Scott Wimmer's cars after Scott started racing at age 14.|$|R
5000|$|Williams {{was born}} in Wall Lake, Iowa. (He was no {{relation}} to singer Andy Williams, also born in Wall Lake.) A veteran [...] "bad guy" [...] actor of 1950s film and TV who began his career after distinguished World War II military service as a United States Navy pilot, for which he received the Navy Cross. In 1952, Williams played the lead, a Los Angeles woman killer, in the film, Without Warning! In 1953, he was cast as <b>Larry,</b> a <b>car</b> bomber, in The Big Heat. He had {{a leading role in}} the 1958 science fiction movie The Space Children. Other notable roles include the psychiatrist in Fear Strikes Out (1957) and Valerian in North by Northwest (1959).|$|R
50|$|Powered by Ford's 4.6L V8 engine, it {{is rated}} at 325HP. The FR500S is often slotted {{in between the}} FR500C ('Boy Racer') and FR500GT ('Man Racer'). The car was {{designed}} by both Ford Racing and Miller Motorsports for the Ford Racing Mustang Challenge series (a racing series founded by <b>Larry</b> Miller). The <b>car</b> features similar aerodynamic parts like those used on the FR500GT, but uses a DOT approved racing tire- BFGoodrich g-Force R1.|$|R
50|$|Larry's father Bob got him {{started in}} racing. Bob {{purchased}} <b>Larry's</b> first race <b>car,</b> a Kurtis Craft Half Midget from Bob Cunningham in Covington, Indiana prior to turning twelve years old. Larry went to Modified Midget racing at the Logansport, Indiana track from 1965-1967. While in modified midget racing Larry {{and his father}} introduced the first car with a suspension system {{in this type of}} racing. It was made by Kurtis out of Indianapolis, Indiana. Eventually all cars would have suspension systems on them.|$|R
50|$|Several cars {{went out}} in the first hour, and at 1:15 p.m., Jim McElreath filled the field to 33 <b>cars.</b> <b>Larry</b> Cannon was the first car on the bubble. Dick Simon bumped him out with ease. Tom Bigelow was now on the bubble. He survived three wave offs, but Jerry Sneva managed to bump him out at 2 p.m. Jerry Sneva's run was not without excitement, as he {{suffered}} a stuck throttle. Rather than wave off, he managed to control the engine with the kill switch, and completed the four laps without incident.|$|R
50|$|The BRM P207 was a Formula One racing car, {{designed}} by Len Terry and constructed by British Racing Motors, which raced in the 1977 Formula One season. It was {{powered by a}} 3.0-litre V12 engine. The car failed to score any points during the season. The team made a total of nine entries during the season, but only qualified in one instance, at the 1977 Brazilian Grand Prix. Driven by <b>Larry</b> Perkins, the <b>car</b> retired on lap one due to overheating. Its qualifying time was six seconds slower {{than that of the}} second-to-last starter. One British journalist in Brazil exclaimed that he was ashamed of being British.|$|R
5000|$|Then Larry and Anne {{break into}} an empty house, but Red and Handsome track them down. Fortunately, Larry manages to knock Red out and Handsome runs away after Anne burns him with a cigarette. Mrs. Breckenbridge also shows up, after an {{encounter}} with Kelly. It comes out that they [...] "broke into" [...] <b>Larry's</b> home; the <b>car</b> is also <b>Larry's.</b> Despite Anne's assumption, {{he is not a}} crook. When the pair return the car to the park for the police to find, two other gang members take them at gunpoint to Slick. Then Mrs. Breckenbridge bursts in. She was following in her car and, when she saw her friends being captured, sent her chauffeur for the police, who arrive and capture the gang.|$|R
5000|$|She buys {{a pretty}} dress and hosiery and {{releases}} her pet canary Delilah. Sitting {{in a public}} park, Anne is propositioned by [...] "Handsome", a persistent guy who will not go away. Anne finally knocks him down and drives off in his car. Handsome {{turns out to be}} a killer, he stole the car she is in, and on the floor of the back seat is the body of a man that he and his partner Red have murdered. Slick, their boss, is displeased when he learns that the body is hidden under his overcoat, which has a label with his name on it. Slick gives Red ten hours to get the coat back, or else. The police are also looking for the stolen vehicle. Unaware of any of this, Ann picks up a handsome young man named <b>Larry</b> Cameron, whose <b>car</b> has broken down.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} week, Park scored {{an emotional}} win for DEI {{by winning the}} Dura Lube 400 at North Carolina Speedway. The same season, driving in the Busch Series, Park {{was involved in a}} crash at Darlington Raceway while driving the No. 31 Chevrolet owned by Ted Marsh. Under caution and still driving on the track, Park's steering wheel came off, causing him to yank a hard left. By complete chance, lap down <b>car</b> <b>Larry</b> Foyt was speeding up to join the lap down line at the same time Park turned. Park was T-boned on the driver's side upon collision with Foyt's car. The severity of the crash caused a massive brain injury as well as several broken ribs. Foyt said that the car was traveling [...] "well over 100 miles per hour." [...] Park was left with noticeably blurry eyes, and slurred speech {{as a result of the}} accident and some have theorized that he never fully recovered from his injuries. The near-fatal crash marked the beginning of Park's long ongoing struggles to get back into NASCAR's divisions somehow. Since he pulled out of the NASCAR sport in 2005 he's only been in a few races since then.|$|R
