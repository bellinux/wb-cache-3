50|$|Golden Virginia is a roll tobacco {{manufactured}} in Nottingham, England by Imperial Tobacco and sold throughout Europe. It is {{a blend of}} fine-cut Virginia, burley and oriental tobaccos. Golden Virginia first appeared in the UK in 1877. In the UK, it is sold in 30g and 50g pouches. The pouches have a zip <b>lock</b> <b>seal</b> to keep the tobacco fresh along with a sticky tab.|$|E
50|$|Members of a {{large and}} {{widespread}} Scottish family are brought together at a highland castle in order to resolve various pieces of family business following a death. Suspicious events soon begin to occur, the body count rises, and a verdict of suicide is not necessarily to be trusted. Enter the gargantuan Doctor Gideon Fell, who applies his substantial powers of deduction {{to the problem of}} how men can be indirectly murdered while they're inside <b>locked,</b> <b>sealed</b> and inaccessible rooms.|$|R

50|$|It is {{not usually}} {{practicable}} to recover closed bell divers direct to the surface {{if it is not}} possible to raise the bell with the <b>lock</b> <b>sealed</b> and internal pressure retained. In such cases it may be possible to deploy another bell to recover the divers. If there is no working voice communication with the disabled bell, the rescue divers need to communicate by other means, and a set of tap codes is available for this purpose. A card describing the code may be attached to the bell inside and outside so that both sets of divers can be sure that they are using the same version of the code.|$|R

40|$|Conference {{keys are}} secret keys {{used by a}} group of users {{commonly}} and with which they can encipher (or decipher) messages such that communications are secure. Based on the Diffie and Hellman’s PKDS, a conference key distribution scheme is presented in this paper. A <b>sealed</b> <b>lock</b> is used to lock the conference key {{in such a way that}} only the private keys of the invited members are matched. Then the <b>sealed</b> <b>lock</b> is thus made public or distributed to all the users, only legitimate users can disclose it and obtain the conference key. In our scheme, the construction of a <b>sealed</b> <b>lock</b> is simple and the revelation of a conference key is efficient as well. 1...|$|R

5000|$|In Assassin's Creed: Revelations, Altaïr {{creates a}} massive library hidden beneath the Masyaf {{fortress}} that supposedly has {{information that can}} tilt the scales in the war between the Templars and the Assassins. Ezio discovers that five <b>locks</b> <b>seal</b> {{the door to the}} library, and that five 'Masyaf keys' must be found in order to open the library. Whenever Ezio finds a Masyaf key, he inadvertently accesses one of Altaïr's memories - deliberately stored inside each key. As Ezio discovers more keys, the memories inside them are further along in Altaïr's life; for example, in the final key, there is a memory of Altaïr in his early 80s, returning to Masyaf to kill Abbas. When Ezio finally enters the Masyaf library, however, there are no books or writings in the library. There is only the skeleton of Altaïr, holding the sixth Masyaf key, and the Apple of Eden on a pedestal {{at the back of the}} room. Ezio chooses to leave the apple, having [...] "seen enough for one life".|$|R
50|$|After a new {{election}} was ordered, another dispute arose over choosing replacements for two election commissioners who resigned. Ultimately, {{a clean slate}} of commissioners was chosen to oversee the special election. On election day, one precinct's ballot box was returned unsealed and, despite state law stating boxes must be <b>locked</b> and <b>sealed</b> at the precinct, the ballots were counted anyway. In the end, DuPree again narrowly bested Ware, this time {{by a margin of}} 217 votes.|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} mating fluid {{transfer}} couplings is constructed having a male connector which {{is provided with}} a pair of opposed rollers mounted to an exterior region thereof. A male half of a fluid transfer coupling is rotatably supported in an opening in an end of the connector and is equipped with an outwardly extending forward portion. The forward portion locks into an engagement and locking region of a female half of the fluid transfer coupling, with female half being rotatably supported in a receptacle. The receptacle has an opening aligned with locking region, with this opening having a pair of concentric, annularly disposed ramps extending around an interior portion of opening. These ramps are inclined toward the interior of the receptacle and are provided with slots through which rollers of the connector pass. After the connector is inserted into the receptacle (engaging forward portion into engagement region), relative rotation between the connector and receptacle causes the rollers to traverse ramps until the rollers abut and are gripped by retainers. This axially forces the forward portion into <b>locked,</b> <b>sealed</b> engagement with the engagement region...|$|R
50|$|The Summer of the Ubume is {{told from}} the {{perspective}} of freelance writer Tatsumi Sekiguchi, who is investigating rumors of a woman at the Kuonji Clinic who has remained pregnant for twenty months after the disappearance of her husband. He seeks advice and help from his close friend Akihiko Chuzenji, whom Sekiguchi refers to by the name of his bookstore ("Kyogokudo"). Sekiguchi is further drawn to the case when he meets the pregnant woman's beautiful sister, Ryoko Kuonji, and she asks for his help in solving her brother-in-law's disappearance from a <b>locked,</b> <b>sealed</b> room. With the help of his friends - Kyogokudo, private eye Reijiro Enokizu, police detective Shujiro Kiba, and fellow reporter Atsuko Chuzenji (Kyogokudo's sister) - Sekiguchi attempts to discover the disappearing husband's fate, but he soon learns that there is much more to the Kuonji Clinic than meets the eye, and that his own involvement with Makio Kuonji's disappearance may run deeper than he thinks. Only Kyogokudo's knowledge of Japanese folklore - and specifically the legend of the ubume, often associated with death in childbirth - can make sense of the conflicting evidence, and Kyogokudo agrees to perform an exorcism that will solve the mystery once and for all.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{commodities}} {{in the commercial}} world has become access to data, specifically personal information. The Internet has rapidly expanded a company s ability to access consumers and individuals personal information, however consumers privacy-concerns regarding the disclosure of their personal information have continued to increase. Using an e-mail marketing campaign, this research explored the impact of using third-party privacy <b>seal</b> (<b>lock)</b> as signals to facilitate consumers disclosing private information. The study employed a live experimental randomised two-group post-test only design, whereby an e-mail advertisement, identical in design except for {{the image of a}} third party <b>seal</b> (<b>lock)</b> placed on the non-control group s e-mail. The test explored whether the e-mail advertisement containing the third-party privacy signal (lock) had an impact on whether or not the recipient behaved in a certain way in comparison to the e-mail advertisement that did not contain a lock. The results showed no real significant difference of the third-party <b>seal</b> (<b>lock)</b> on the consumer s preparedness to disclose personal information. Whilst the lock may be used as a trust symbol it is not enough, within the online advertising context, to entice disclosure of personal information. To remain competitive, companies will need to reassess their advertising strategies and further research will need to identify high value signals to encourage consumer disclosure.

50|$|Hyrieus hired Trophonius and Agamedes {{to build}} a {{treasure}} chamber for him but they also built a secret entrance to it, so that the treasury was easily accessible by removing just one stone from the outside.

He was dumbfounded at discovering that his fortune was diminishing while the <b>locks</b> and <b>seals</b> remained intact; to catch the thief, he laid a snare.
