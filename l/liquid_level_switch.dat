The <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> in the horizontal pipe is controlled {{in the middle}} of the pipe. The <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> is controlled by a <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> sensor in the horizontal pipe and a control valve in the gas run. As the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> rises in the horizontal pipe, the level sensor sends a signal to the control valve and which begins to pinch shut to create some slight back pressure to push the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> down. Conversely, as <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> goes goes down, the control valve beings to open to relieve pressure to allow the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> to rise. In essence, the control valve modulates to maintain the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> {{in the middle of}} the horizontal pipe. With a large gas/liquid interface area, thin gas-bearing emulsion layer and quiescent flow in the horizontal pipe, all contribute to the final removal of free gas bubbles from the liquid stream.

Shewhart control charts {{were used to assess}} the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> sensing capacity and reliability of the mobile CO 2 -laser engraved LPFG sensor. There were ten groups of different <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> experiment and each group underwent ten repeated wavelength shift measurements. The results showed that all measurands were within the control limits; thus, this mobile sensor was reliable and exhibited at least 100 -cm <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> measurement capacity. In addition, a reflective sensor consisting of five LPFGs in series with a reflective end has been developed to evaluate the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> and fluid-flow velocity. These five LPFGs were fabricated by the electrical arc discharge method and the reflective end was coated with silver by Tollen’s test. After each <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> experiment was performed five times, the average values of the resonance wavelength shifts for LPFG Nos. 1 – 5 were in the range of 1. 35 – 9. 14 nm. The experimental findings showed that the reflective sensor could be used to automatically monitor five fixed <b>liquid</b> <b>levels.</b> This reflective sensor also exhibited at least 100 -cm <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> measurement capacity. The mechanism of the fluid-flow velocity sensor was based on analyzing the relationship among the optical power, time, and the LPFG’s length. There were two types of fluid-flow velocity measurements: inflow and drainage processes. The differences between the LPFG-based fluid-flow velocities and the measured average fluid-flow velocities were found in the range of 8. 7 – 12. 6 %. For the first time to our knowledge, we have demonstrated the feasibility of <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> and fluid-flow velocity sensing with a reflective LPFG-based sensor without modifying LPFGs or coating chemical compounds...|$|R
