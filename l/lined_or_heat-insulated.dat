50|$|Due to {{the effect}} of a spatial context or {{temporal}} context, the perceived orientation of a test <b>line</b> <b>or</b> grating pattern can appear tilted away from its physical orientation. The tilt illusion (TI) is the phenomenon that the perceived orientation of a test <b>line</b> <b>or</b> grating is altered by the presence of surrounding <b>lines</b> <b>or</b> grating with a different orientation (spatial context; see Fig.1).

5000|$|An {{important}} function {{performed by a}} substation is switching, which is the connecting and disconnecting of transmission <b>lines</b> <b>or</b> other components {{to and from the}} system. Switching events may be planned or unplanned. A transmission <b>line</b> <b>or</b> other component may need to be de-energized for maintenance or for new construction, for example, adding or removing a transmission <b>line</b> <b>or</b> a transformer. To maintain reliability of supply, companies aim at keeping the system up and running while performing maintenance. All work to be performed, from routine testing to adding entirely new substations, should be done while keeping the whole system running.Unplanned switching events are caused by a fault in a transmission <b>line</b> <b>or</b> any other component, for example: ...|$|R
