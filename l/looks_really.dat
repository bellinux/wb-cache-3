500|$|ReelViews {{film critic}} James Berardinelli gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and {{wrote that the}} film was [...] "one of those rare family films that parents can enjoy (rather than endure) along with their kids." [...] Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling it [...] "cheerful, high-energy fun, and like the other Pixar movies, has a running supply of gags and {{references}} aimed at grownups." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum from Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B" [...] grade and praised the film's animation, stating [...] "Everything from Pixar Animation Studios — the snazzy, cutting-edge computer animation outfit — <b>looks</b> <b>really,</b> really terrific and unspools with a liberated, heppest-moms-and-dads-on-the-block iconoclasm." ...|$|E
500|$|Khanna {{made her}} screen debut {{opposite}} Bobby Deol in Rajkumar Santoshi's romance Barsaat (1995). She was cast by Dharmendra {{and before the}} film's release Khanna signed for two more projects. It performed well {{at the box office}} and became the sixth-highest-grossing film of the year, and she received the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for her performance. The following year she played lead roles in Raj Kanwar's action film Jaan and Lawrence D'Souza's romance Dil Tera Diwana opposite Ajay Devgan and Saif Ali Khan respectively. K.N. Vijiyan of the New Straits Times wrote that [...] "Khanna does not look like a typical Hindi actress". While reviewing Dil Tera Diwana, Vijiyan wrote about Khanna: [...] "Unlike her previous movies, she <b>looks</b> <b>really</b> good in all her scenes and she can act well." [...] In 1997, two films featuring her; Uff! Yeh Mohabbat and Itihaas were released. Both of these films were poor box office performers. Her only release in 1998 was Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai, which featured her as Salman Khan's love interest.|$|E
500|$|Six {{companies}} {{working on}} different scenes and elements created 500shots of visual {{effects in the}} film. These were at times altered weekly due to the reactions of test audiences in screenings. CIS Visual Effects Group assisted with the Scorcher VI faux trailer and twenty additional shots for the home media release. To expand on the comedy in the film, some of the explosions and crashes were embellished to look more destructive. The visual effects supervisor Michael Fink reflected on the exaggerated explosions: [...] "We worked really {{hard to make the}} CG crashing helicopter in the hot landing sequence look real. Ben was adamant about that, {{but at the same time}} he wanted the explosion to be huge. When you see it hit the ground, it was like it was filled with gasoline! It was the same thing with Ben's sergeant character, who almost intercepts a hand grenade... Now, I was in the Army for three years and no hand grenade would make an explosion like that... But it was a big dramatic moment and it <b>looks</b> <b>really</b> cool... and feels kind of real." ...|$|E

500|$|Appearing {{in series}} two, Ianto assists {{the team in}} field {{missions}} and {{is used by the}} writers as a vehicle for one-liner jokes. Commenting on this, portrayer Gareth David-Lloyd notes that [...] "This season it's much more relaxed and he's not all about keeping secrets, he's about Torchwood and Jack— he's found his meaning and his place so his dry humour comes out a lot more and he's happier." [...] The developments in Ianto's character were also reflected in the wardrobe choice. [...] "For series two," [...] comments Ray Holman, [...] "we evolved the look quite a lot, and now his suits {{come from all over the}} place. It's just a question of where I see something that looks right for Gareth, so I've brought him a suit from Savile Row and suits from Zara and Next. We realised we could be a bit more flash with Ianto now he's come out of the background and started to assert himself a bit more. So we moved him into coloured shirts and snazzier ties. He started off in white and grey shirts but we realised his skin tones can take the extra colour and now he's evolving into something much sharper, which <b>looks</b> <b>really</b> good filmed in high definition." ...|$|E
500|$|The artwork of Gunnerkrigg Court {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "stylized," [...] with simple character designs."What he did was make an intentional choice to make his characters very cartoony." [...] At least one reviewer, on the other hand, has noticed that the backgrounds, in contrast to the characters, are often very elaborate."His characters are really simple, and some of his backgrounds are really complicated." [...] The comic has also been described as having a [...] "rich" [...] look in spite of its limited color palette,"I love his use of color, too, in particular, because he never has more than like ten colors on the average page, but it <b>looks</b> <b>really</b> really rich." [...] and Siddell himself has stated that he first developed the idea for the comic using {{only a limited number of}} colors.Siddell: [...] "I did another sketch right after that of the same girl and, wanting to color it but only having a very limited selection of marker pens, put her in an ugly school uniform with some crazy makeup." [...] The pieces of artwork that Siddell has posted at the end of each printed book, entitled [...] "Treatise" [...] and [...] "Second Treatise," [...] demonstrate many such of Siddell's artistic and storytelling motifs: they integrate alchemical symbols, mythological figures, nature, and technology.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} become the {{character}} of Dot Cotton, Brown is required to wear a wig to replicate Dot's 1950s [...] "Italian Boy" [...] hairstyle that has remained in a largely unchanged style since she first appeared in 1985. Although Brown now wears a wig, for many years the hair sported by Dot actually belonged to the actress. Brown has stated {{that as soon as}} Dot's hairpiece is on, she becomes the character. The unchanged style of Dot was deemed so important by the programme makers, that when Brown requested to have dental work carried out to improve her prominent front teeth, the producers refused to allow it, arguing that Dot could not afford expensive tooth capping. Brown was not permitted to alter her teeth until early 1991 when they became loose. Brown has indicated that she does not want Dot's style altered. She claimed in 2002 that Dot had the same coats in her wardrobe that she was given in 1985. The fur-collared coat Dot wears for special occasions was donated by the character Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) in 1988 when she left the serial. Brown commented, [...] "I like the older clothes [...] I don't want new clothes, I'm happy the way she is. She thinks she <b>looks</b> <b>really</b> smart.

On August 3, 2010, Bain claimed that [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] {{is one of the}} videos that should have been nominated for Video of the Year at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, and she later said on September 8, 2010, that the clip for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] should have been nominated instead that of [...] "Video Phone", in the category for Best Female Video at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards.

[...] In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the video at number three on their list of Knowles' ten best music videos, writing, [...] "It's like a trip back in time. Except with sexier outfits, which were definitely missing from the '60s. So good call, Beyoncé! You can even upgrade history!".

500|$|On 13 December 2012, {{the group}} posted a lyric video of [...] "Change Your Life" [...] on their Vevo account. It was {{originally}} {{speculated that the}} music video would have visuals reflecting the theme of self-belief and overcoming self-doubt. On 15 January 2013, Jade Thirlwall told Robert Copsey of Digital Spy that the music video will showcase Little Mix's individual personalities, [...] "We always want our videos {{to be the best}} we can do," [...] Thirlwall explained. She also revealed that the video will be more mellow and real than the group's previous music videos. [...] "We're just chilling and portraying the song and performing it how it should be; there are no fireworks or backflips, it's just us delivering a great song," [...] Thirlwall added. Little Mix wanted to showcase who they are with the video by centering it more around themselves than in previous music videos. The official music video for [...] "Change Your Life" [...] was set to be released on 18 January 2013, but it premiered on Vevo on 31 January instead. It was filmed in two days. Scenes from the video were filmed at the Rhyl Pavilion Theatre in Rhyl when the group were performing a show there as part of their DNA Tour at the end of January in 2013. A spokesman for the theatre said, [...] "We are very proud to be featured as part of Little Mix's 'Change Your Life' video and feel it's a huge achievement for the Rhyl Pavilion". The video features cameos from Jade Thirlwall's mother, Norma Thirlwall, and Perrie Edwards' mother, Debbie Dufty. Norma Thirlwall said, [...] "After a while, everyone forgot the cameras were there, so it <b>looks</b> <b>really</b> natural". Following a product placement deal brokered by Starcom MediaVest's content division, Liquid Thread, the video also sees the Samsung Galaxy features exclusivity in its technology category. Andrew Wynd, head of media, corporate marketing for Samsung Electronics, opined, [...] "It has been fantastic to be able to seamlessly showcase some of [...] functionality in the Little Mix video."

2500|$|Stone grew up {{listening}} {{to a wide variety of}} music including 1960s and 1970s American R and soul music performed by such artists as Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin. As a result, she developed a soulful style of singing like her idols. [...] "My first CD that I owned was Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits. And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, 'Oh yeah, that <b>looks</b> <b>really</b> good', so I wrote it down and I said to my mum, 'Can I have that for Christmas?' So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved." [...] She would later tell MTV News: [...] "I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. You've got to have good vocals to sing soul music and I always liked it ever since I was little." ...|$|E
2500|$|After signing onto Hypnotic Records in 1999, Quo Vadis {{received}} {{a budget of}} around $20,000 to record their second album. Recorded at Victor Studios and produced again by Quo Vadis and Pierre Rémillard, Day into Night was released on March 30, 2000 in Canada. Whereas the composing duties for Forever were credited to all members, {{a majority of the}} songs on the Day Into Night album were in fact written and recorded by Arie. However, due to logistical problems, the album was released to Europe in December. To promote the album a video for [...] "Dysgenics" [...] was made. Remy commented on the making of the video, [...] "It was long! We did two days of shooting. It's not the most pleasant thing to do lipsing and pretend to be playing, but it's all worth it in the end. What's really fun is the editing, seeing the whole thing take shape. We did a video release in Music Plus studios in December, but what people saw that day wasn't the finished version.

60|$|We were {{received}} with much courtesy and emphasis {{by the director}} of the foundry, and conducted into a large room walled with bare, new brick, where the statue {{was standing in front of}} the extinct furnace: a majestic Webster indeed, eight feet high, and looking even more colossal than that. The likeness seemed to me perfect, and, like a sensible man, Powers' has dressed him in his natural costume, such as I have seen Webster have on while making a speech in the open air at a mass meeting in Concord,--dress-coat buttoned pretty closely across the breast, pantaloons and boots,--everything finished even to a seam and a stitch. Not an inch of the statue but is Webster; even his coat-tails are imbued with the man, and this true artist has succeeded in showing him through the broadcloth as nature showed him. He has felt that a man's actual clothes are as much a part of him as his flesh, and I respect him for disdaining to shirk the difficulty by throwing the meanness of a cloak over it, and for recognizing the folly of masquerading our Yankee statesman in a Roman toga, and the indecorousness of presenting him as a brassy nudity. It would have been quite as unjustifiable to strip him to his skeleton as to his flesh. Webster is represented as holding in his right hand the written roll of the Constitution, with which he points to a bundle of fasces, which he keeps from falling by the grasp of his left, thus symbolizing him as the preserver of the Union. There is an expression of quiet, solid, massive strength in the whole figure; a deep, pervading energy, in which any exaggeration of gesture would lessen and lower the effect. He <b>looks</b> <b>really</b> like a pillar of the state. The face is very grand, very Webster stern and awful, because he is in the act of meeting a great crisis, and yet with the warmth of a great heart glowing through it. Happy is Webster to have been so truly and adequately sculptured; happy the sculptor in such a subject, which no idealization of a demigod could have supplied him with. Perhaps the statue at the bottom of the sea will be cast up in some future age, when the present race of man is forgotten, and if so, that far posterity will look up to us as a grander race than we find ourselves to be. Neither was Webster altogether the man he looked. His physique helped him out, even when he fell somewhat short of its promise; and if his eyes had not been in such deep caverns their fire would not have looked so bright.|$|E
