25|$|The {{life cycle}} {{considered}} usually {{consists of a}} number of stages including: materials extraction, processing and manufacturing, product use, and product disposal. If the most environmentally harmful of these stages can be determined, then impact on the environment can be efficiently reduced by focusing on making changes for that particular phase. For example, the most energy-intensive <b>life</b> <b>phase</b> of an airplane or car is during use due to fuel consumption. One of the most effective ways to increase fuel efficiency is to decrease vehicle weight, and thus, car and airplane manufacturers can decrease environmental impact in a significant way by replacing heavier materials with lighter ones such as aluminium or carbon fiber-reinforced elements. The reduction during the use phase should be more than enough to balance additional raw material or manufacturing cost.|$|E
25|$|A life {{script is}} a schema that {{outlines}} cultural appropriate events that individuals should experience during {{a specific time}} period. (Berntsen & Rubin, 2004). The life script account argues that the reminiscence bump occurs because individuals use life script memories to provide a basis of recalling important memories. The life script events often contain more memories during early adulthood, or the reminiscence bump, than any other age period (Berntsen & Rubin, 2004).The life script account emphasizes norms and expectations typical of a given culture {{with regard to the}} timing of major life events. The order and timing of the major events may differ depending on the culture. The life script is a representation of the sequence of normative and major life events. Individuals know the culturally shared expectations of the order and timing of life events in a prototypical life, and are also aware of their own timing in relations to those norms. It assumes that people have an internalized culturally-aware script of the events that make up an expected, skeletal life course; this script acts as a template for the recall of life events in association with each <b>life</b> <b>phase.</b>|$|E

50|$|Drawing on {{the work}} of Karl Mannheim and Helmut Schelsky, Klaus Hurrelmann links this {{approach}} to generational research. His aim is to work out how technological, economic, and political events shape personality in generation-specific ways. This reveals how the need to deal permanently with unpredictable futures and uncertain life perspectives is leading to a mentality of tentatively probing and pragmatically testing alternatives in the young generation born between 1985 and 2000. Klaus Hurrelmann calls these members of the current young generation, which he also labels “Generation Y,” “ego tacticians.” He analyzes this concept theoretically together with Gudrun Quenzel in the textbook Lebensphase Jugend (<b>Life</b> <b>phase</b> adolescence) and describes it together with Erik Albrecht in the book Die heimlichen Revolutionäre (The secret revolutionaries). Recently, research on the youngest generation, born between 2000 and 2015, has been initiated (§Generation Z").|$|E
50|$|Klaus Hurrelmann also conceives {{adolescence}} as {{an autonomous}} <b>life</b> <b>phase</b> that has inserted itself between childhood and adulthood {{over the last}} 100 years. This phase of life generally lasts for about 15 years. Nowadays, it is beginning earlier {{than ever before in}} human history, because children reach puberty at an increasingly early age. At the other end, however, adolescence is more open than ever before and has become basically unplannable. This impacts on the mastering of developmental tasks: In the areas of education and qualification the demands are rising; the separation from parents and the development of own attachments are being postpoined, and the acquisition of competencies as a consumer, user of media, economic citizen, as well as participation in politics and society are more and more considered as tasks that have to be managed on one's own responsibility.|$|E
50|$|Epidemiological links {{are seen}} between FP rates, {{nitrogen}} footprints, and invasive macroalgae. The strongest association with FP is with habitat type, especially increased anthropogenic activity causing high-nitrogen footprints in a surrounding environment where green sea turtles are found. Sea turtles do live in very complex ecosystems, with both near-shore habitats and {{several years in}} the open ocean, which makes study of ecosystem associations difficult. Even so, observations {{support the hypothesis that}} near-shore habitats have a strong correlation with the disease, as newly recruited individuals from the pelagic <b>life</b> <b>phase</b> have never been found with tumours, and when migrating to more shallow ocean zones, such as the neritic zone, individuals still remain free from FP, but when entering lagoon systems, turtles may become infected. The high prevalence of FP is also associated with habitats’ poor quality, while FP is absent in some habitats of good quality.|$|E

30|$|Fruit production, seed dispersal, {{germination}} and seedling establishment {{are critical}} <b>life</b> <b>phases</b> in plants (Harper 1997). A {{clear understanding of}} these issues are crucial to recognize patterns of colonization and extinction, directional changes in species composition or succession over time, which have strong relevance for ecosystem restoration (Hobbs et al. 2007). Information on relevant <b>life</b> <b>phases</b> of Afromontane plant species is scarce. In the absence of this information there are no means to identify the risks of failure of management measures {{and the means to}} overcome them. This information helps to understand filters of succession that determine the floristic composition of the secondary forest resulting from a passive restoration treatment. An understanding of these key processes allows the prediction of the likely outcome of any silvicultural measure in terms of vitality, density, survival, growth and quality of regeneration at an appropriate time (Wagner et al. 2010).|$|R

More wave exposure decreased the number of reductive cell and changed the pattern of production time in difference scenarios.

50|$|In The Sims 3: Generations, each <b>life</b> <b>phase</b> has a theme. For children, {{imagination}} is the theme. For teens, rebellious, chaotic scenes such as parties while parents are out {{on vacation and}} pranks are an addition. As a young adult and adult, {{the focus is on}} their relationships with others; from getting married to having children of their own. Elders get to enjoy their time reminiscing about the golden years and the joys of watching their grandchildren grow up. Generations is so far one of two expansion packs (the other being Seasons) to come without a new town for Sims to explore. Players can now add body hair to males in Create a Sim. Two new traits come with Generations. The first is the rebellious trait, while the second is the nurturing trait. Sims with the rebellious trait can make trouble pulling off various pranks, such as doorbell ditching, adding hair dye to their sibling's shampoo, and making the toilet explode. Sims with the nurturing trait are better at taking care of kids and can punish naughty Sims by giving them timeouts, banning video games, and grounding them. The player can now enroll child Sims in after-school activities. The two available for children are ballet and scouts. Teenagers can join up to two High School clubs including the sports team, drama club, debate team, school band, and student newspaper.|$|E
40|$|In nature, {{bacteria}} {{alternate between}} two modes of growth: a unicellular <b>life</b> <b>phase,</b> {{in which the}} cells are free-swimming (planktonic), and a multicellular <b>life</b> <b>phase,</b> in which the cells are sessile and live in a biofilm, that {{can be defined as}} surface-associated microbial heterogeneous structures comprising different populations of microorganisms surrounded by a self-produced matrix that allows their attachment to inert or organic surfaces. While a unicellular <b>life</b> <b>phase</b> allows for bacterial dispersion and the colonization of new environments, biofilms allow sessile cells to live in a coordinated, more permanent manner that favors their proliferation. In this alternating cycle, bacteria accomplish two physiological transitions via differential gene expression: (i) from planktonic cells to sessile cells within a biofilm, and (ii) from sessile to detached, newly planktonic cells. Many of the innate characteristics of biofilm bacteria are of biotechnological interest, such as the synthesis of valuable compounds (e. g., surfactants, ethanol) and the enhancement/processing of certain foods (e. g., table olives). Understanding the ecology of biofilm formation will allow the design of systems that will facilitate making products of interest and improve their yields...|$|E
40|$|Sexual desire {{may change}} {{according}} to two principles: the satisfaction principle (high sexual opportunity/frequency decreases sexual desire) and the adaptation principle (high sexual opportunity/frequency increases sexual desire). We explore the workings of these opposing principles separately for both genders across the adult life span.
