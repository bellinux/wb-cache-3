5|$|After {{delivery}} of the barium-lanthanum material to Los Alamos, it was stored in a dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site. At first, the mixture was used as-is, both barium and lanthanum together, but this led to unpleasant radioactive contamination that took a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> disappear as the half-life of barium-140 is 12.5 days. Shortly after, the process was improved; barium was removed chemically, by double precipitation from a solution as barium sulfate.|$|E

However, according to Claude Shannon, there are 1043 legal positions in chess, so it will take an impossibly <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology.|$|E

5|$|The {{wood turtle}} takes a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reach sexual maturity, {{has a low}} {{fecundity}} (ability to reproduce), but has a high adult survival rate. However, the high survival rates are not true of juveniles or hatchlings. Although males establish hierarchies, they are not territorial. The wood turtle becomes sexually mature between 14 and 18 years of age. Mating activity among wood turtles peaks {{in the spring and}} again in the fall, although it is known to mate throughout the portion of the year they are active. However, it has been observed mating in December. In one rare instance, a female wood turtle hybridized with a male Blanding's turtle.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the chief}} {{architectural}} concerns {{for the design of}} venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety. The speed at which the venue can be emptied is important both for amenity and safety because large crowds take a very <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> disperse from a badly designed venue and this in turn creates a safety risk. The Hillsborough disaster {{is an example of how}} poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. Sightlines and acoustics are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} research was to know the influence of combination of oranges extract and petragenol to Feeding Strategy of Bactrocera dorsalis flies. This research used the Y tube method. The 60 fruit flies were used as samples. The 10 flies were placed in start chamber Y tube and in two other tips were placed the bait as a single or combinations of non-matured oranges extract and petragenol (A), matured oranges extract and petragenol (B), decay-oranges extract and petragenol (C), and petragenol as control (D). Feeding Strategy defined by the need of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reach the bait and the spend of time in the bait with categories as activity of Searching, Grounding, Gathering, and Learning. The data analyzed by Chi-square (X 2). The results showed that the fastest searching activity in B, the <b>longest</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> gathering activity in A, the <b>longest</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> grounding activity in non-matured oranges extract, and the <b>longest</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> learning activity in matured oranges extract. It can conlude that the best attractant to teas Bactrocera dorsalis Feeding Strategy are matured oranges extract-petragenol combination for Searching and Learning activity, and combination of non-matured oranges extract and petragenol to grounding and gathering activity...|$|R
5|$|Albatross chicks take a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> fledge. In {{the case}} of the great albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes {{anywhere}} between 140 and 170 days. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents, and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. Albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents, who return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first out at sea.|$|E
5|$|Mona had booked the Les Stewart Quartet to {{play the}} opening night with Harrison on guitar, but they {{cancelled}} the booking after Stewart and Brown had a quarrel. Stewart was angry that Brown had missed a rehearsal, because Brown was helping Mona to decorate the club.

Lennon, McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe and Harrison went to the club to arrange the booking, to which Mona agreed, but said she needed to finish painting the club first. All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders, dragons, rainbows, stars, and a beetle, which still survive. John Lennon was short-sighted, mistaking gloss for emulsion paint, which took a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> dry in the dark, damp cellar. Cynthia Powell, later the wife of Lennon, painted a silhouette of John Lennon on the wall, which is also still intact.|$|E
5|$|The Corporal had {{numerous}} limitations. It took a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> set up, {{so it could}} not engage targets of opportunity; there could be delays in the countdown process, which {{made it hard to}} warn the troops to close their eyes or aircraft to avoid the area; and it was guided by a radio beam that not only could be jammed, but could actually be diverted. Moreover, during test firings in the Outer Hebrides, although eight out of twelve missiles accurately hit their targets, four fell short, which is always regrettable but particularly so when nuclear weapons are involved in view of the danger it posed to one's own troops. A new British project was therefore launched to develop a better missile, codenamed Blue Water, which was to have used the British Indigo Hammer and later the Tony warhead.|$|E

Although they had a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> prepare, the MCC had some difficulty in assembling enough men to represent Port Phillip; many potential players were unable to spare the time to travel to Van Diemen's Land. Even as the team prepared to depart, only ten people had been found, and the eleventh, Duncan Cooper, only joined as they left on the steamer Shamrock. The eleven Victorian players, accompanied by many acquaintances, both men and women, arrived in Launceston on 9 February. On the evening of their arrival, they attended a dinner at the Cornwall Hotel with 100 paying guests. The following day, the team won a match against Bishopthorpe College. There was little time to practise before the intercolonial game.|$|E

5|$|The park's woods are {{important}} because they provide shelter for {{a large number of}} animals. They are a natural defence against landslides, avalanches, and flooding. The two main types of woods found in the park are coniferous and deciduous woods. The deciduous European beech forests are common on the Piedmont side of the park, and are not found on the dryer Valle d'Aosta side. These forests are thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during the summer. The beech leaves take a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> decompose, and they form a thick layer on the woodland floor that impedes the development of other plants and trees. Larches are the most common trees in the forests on the valley floors. They are mixed with spruces, Swiss stone pines, and more rarely silver firs.|$|E
