25|$|Equine <b>linkage</b> <b>group</b> II {{includes}} {{a number of}} genes. The first linkage was found between a blood type marker and tobiano white spotting in 1978. The same blood type marker, albumin, was linked to another blood protein called vitamin D-binding protein. In 1982, a linkage grouping was proposed, including three genes for serum proteins, and three for coat color: tobiano spotting, chestnut, and roan. Research since equine <b>linkage</b> <b>group</b> II was defined has identified {{the exact location of}} the tobiano allele and the chestnut allele. The region of the chromosome that harbors the roan gene is homologous to parts of chromosomes in other species that also control coat color, even some similar to roan. Presently, the KIT gene is the primary candidate gene for roan. While a chromosomal inversion of KIT causes tobiano white spotting, KIT also harbors one or more alleles responsible for sabino spotting, no fewer than eleven alleles responsible for dominant white spotting, and is thought to be a major contributor to many other forms of less distinctive white markings.|$|E

The LIMD can identify <b>linkage</b> <b>groups</b> with at most order of k when it is applied to O(2 k) strings.

Twenty-one microsatellite loci originating from E. globulus {{and four other}} Eucalyptus species {{were added to the}} RAPD maps.

50|$|The {{evolution}} of the gene family in primitive vertebrates is not well understood. For example, {{it has been shown}} that the gene coding for the ancestral relaxin peptide existed independently from the other genes of the insulin superfamily, i.e. INS and IGF genes, in the early chordate ancestor. It is known that the genes coding for RLN3 and INSL5 arose from one ancestral gene, and INSL3 shares origin with RLN2 and its multiple duplicates. However the exact origins of the family still remain to be elucidated. Other studies attempted to show the existence of relaxin family peptide genes in the tunicate Ciona, but it has not been shown that any of these are in the same <b>linkage</b> <b>group</b> as modern relaxin genes. Multiple relaxin genes have also been identified in Amphioxus, but again syntenic relationship of these genes to modern relaxin genes is unclear and experimental work is lacking. A relaxin-like peptide, previously referred to as “Gonad Stimulating Substance” was also characterized in the echinoderm Patiria pectinifera (starfish). There is evidence that the starfish peptide is involved in reproductive processes and functions via a G-protein coupled receptor, which supports its relatedness to vertebrate relaxins.|$|E
50|$|Background {{selection}} {{describes the}} loss of genetic diversity at a non-deleterious locus due to negative selection against linked deleterious alleles. It is one form of linked selection, where the maintenance or removal of an allele from a population is dependent upon the alleles in its <b>linkage</b> <b>group.</b> The name emphasizes {{the fact that the}} genetic background, or environment, of a neutral mutation has a significant impact on whether it will be preserved (genetic hitchhiking) or purged (background selection) from a population. In some cases, the term background selection is used broadly to refer to all forms of linked selection, but most often it is used only when neutral variation is reduced due to negative selection against deleterious mutations. Background selection and all forms of linked selection contradict the assumption of the Neutral theory of molecular evolution that the fixation or loss of neutral alleles is entirely stochastic, the result of genetic drift. Instead, these models predict that neutral variation is correlated with the selective pressures acting on linked non-neutral genes, that neutral traits are not necessarily oblivious to selection. Because they segregate together, non-neutral mutations linked to neutral polymorphisms result in decreased levels of genetic variation relative to predictions of neutral evolution.|$|E

Current studies are directed towards the genetic analysis of development in S. coelicolor. While G.

He now has an established international reputation as the leading pioneer and authority in what has become a very important aspect of microbial genetics.|$|E

The double pseudotest-cross mapping strategy was applied using three types of molecular markers. The efficiency of SSRs to anchor homologous <b>linkage</b> <b>groups</b> from different Vitis maps and the usefulness of AFLPs in saturating molecular linkage maps were evaluated. Moreover, the SSCP technique was developed based on sequence information in public databases concerning genes involved in flavonoid and stilbene biosynthesis. For the maternal genetic map a total of 338 markers were assembled in 20 <b>linkage</b> <b>groups</b> covering 1, 639 cM, whereas 429 loci defined the 19 <b>linkage</b> <b>groups</b> of the paternal map which covers 1, 518 cM. The identification of 14 <b>linkage</b> <b>groups</b> common to both maps was possible based on 21 SSR and 19 AFLP loci. The position of SSR loci in the maps presented here was consistent with other published mapping experiments in Vitis...|$|R
