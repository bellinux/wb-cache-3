He's kind of today's equivalent of Peter Sellers." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson saw King Kong as {{opportunity}} for technical innovations in motion capture, commissioning Christian Rivers of Weta Digital to supervise {{all aspects of}} Kong's performance. Jackson decided early on {{that he did not}} want Kong to behave like a human, and so he and his team studied hours of gorilla footage. Serkis was cast in the title role in April 2003 and prepared himself by working with gorillas at the London Zoo. He then traveled to Rwanda, observing the actions and behaviors of gorillas in the wild. Rivers explained that the detailed facial performance capture with Serkis was accomplished because of the similarities between human and gorilla faces. [...] "Gorillas have such a similar looking set of eyes and brows, you can <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> expressions and transpose your own interpretation onto them." [...] Photos of silverback gorillas were also superimposed on Kong's image in the early stages of animation. Serkis had to go through two hours of motion capture makeup every day, having 135 small markers attached to different spots on his face. Following principal photography, Serkis had to spend an additional two months on a motion capture stage, miming Kong's movements for the film's digital animators.|$|E

500|$|Critic William Sylvester {{states that}} the metaphors in Angelou's poetry serve as [...] "coding", or litotes, for {{meanings}} understood by other Blacks. [...] In her poem [...] "Sepia Fashion Show", for example, the last lines ("I'd remind them please, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> knees / you got a Miss Ann's scrubbing") is a reference to slavery, when Black women had to show their knees to prove how hard they had cleaned. [...] Sylvester states that this is true in much of Angelou's poetry, and that it elicits {{a change in the}} reader's emotions; in this poem, from humor to anger. [...] Sylvester says that Angelou uses the same technique in [...] "Letter to an Aspiring Junkie", in which understatement contained in the repeated phrase [...] "nothing happens" [...] is a litotes for the prevalence of violence in society. [...] Hagen connects this poem with the final scene in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name, which describes her encounter with her friend, a drug addict who shows her the effects of his drug habit. [...] According to Hagen, the poem is full of disturbing images, such as drugs being a slave master and the junkie being tied to his habit like a monkey attached to the street vendor's strap.|$|E
500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{a great deal}} of the scenes in [...] "Boys' Club" [...] were improvised by the actors. For example, Nick Offerman improvised the line [...] "Put it in an e-mail?", which he said when Leslie told him she had a very long story to tell him. Schur thought the line was [...] "my {{favorite}} thing in the show", and they made him say in it every subsequent take during filming. Aziz Ansari also improvised a majority of the scene in which he helped Leslie prepare for her ethics board review. Dean Holland, Parks and Recreations editor, said it was his favorite scene from the entire first season. Amy Poehler improvised the line at the courtyard gathering, after she accidentally spilled several beer bottles, [...] "I feel like I'm already in the boys' club. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> bitches cleanin' up after me." [...] Schur said the line helped develop Leslie's character in future episodes because [...] "we realized that Leslie can be a little bit cooler than we had originally thought". The scene with Ron describing his ideal government was written for a different episode, but was moved to [...] "Boys' Club" [...] when the producers decided it fit better there. Schur said it was his favorite moment in the episode. [...] "Boys' Club" [...] ends with Leslie and Mark toasting a beer to each other because Schur said, [...] "It's a running joke in the writer's room that every episode should end with clinking beers." ...|$|E
500|$|Critic William Sylvester {{states that}} the metaphors in Angelou's poetry serve as [...] "coding", or litotes, for {{meanings}} understood by other Blacks. In her poem [...] "Sepia Fashion Show" [...] in Diiie, for example, the last lines ("I'd remind them please, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> knees / you got a Miss Ann's scrubbing") is a reference to slavery, when Black women had to show their knees to prove how hard they had cleaned. Sylvester states that Angelou uses this technique often in her poetry, and that it elicits {{a change in the}} reader's emotions; in this poem, from humor to anger. Sylvester says that Angelou uses the same technique in [...] "Letter to an Aspiring Junkie", also in Diiie, in which the understatement contained in the repeated phrase [...] "nothing happens" [...] is a litotes for the prevalence of violence in society. Hagen calls Angelou's coding [...] "signifying" [...] and states, [...] "A knowledge of black linguistic regionalisms and folklore enhances the appreciation of Angelou's poems". Hagen believes that despite the signifying that occurs in many of Angelou's poems, the themes and topics are universal enough that all readers would understand and appreciate them. DeGout states that Angelou conveys meaning through literary imagery, denser vocabulary, and poetic techniques such as catachresis, ambiguity, and anthropomorphism. Angelou's use of language frees her readers from their traditional perceptions and beliefs about human experience. She uses everyday language, the Black vernacular, Black music and forms, and rhetorical techniques such as shocking language, the occasional use of profanity, and traditionally unacceptable subjects. DeGout says that although this use of language is not the main technique she uses in her poetry, it appears in her more popular poems.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of the episode's {{release on}} DVD were mostly positive, calling the episode [...] "wickedly funny, {{no matter how}} offensive." [...] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press commented that [...] "What, in other hands, {{could have been a}} serious, even heart-wrenching story is on Family Guy a devilish burlesque — not to mention a wickedly astute {{examination}} of the current abortion clash." [...] Moore also noted, however, that [...] "the uninitiated, the faint-of-heart and, most of all, the anti-abortion crowd should maybe choose to take a pass." [...] Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times deemed the episode [...] "typical of that audacious Fox animated comedy, teeming with rapid-fire jokes and willfully offensive non sequiturs about disabled animals, God, Nazis, bodily functions and the sexual habits of 'Sesame Street' characters." [...] In a slightly more mixed review of the DVD release, Cindy White of IGN criticized the episode for its shock value, but appreciated [...] "that the writers didn't cop out in the end, and actually picked a side." [...] White went on to comment that it was [...] "hard to believe that the writers ever expected 'Partial Terms of Endearment' to make it to air" [...] and that [...] "even devoted, longtime fans of the show may be a little uncomfortable with the subject matter." [...] White gave the release a 7 out of 10 rating. Assessing Family Guys impact on television, Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon commented on the portrayal of abortion: [...] "That Family Guy, that doofy, generally unfunny bastion of sophomoric jokes, should {{be one of the few}} shows brave enough to even address the topic is bananas [...] And that Fox wouldn't air the episode says we're still a long way from having anybody on 'Glee' or 'The Office' or 'House' <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> telltale lines on the stick and finally decide what millions of American women have — that they're just not ready for motherhood." ...|$|E

The Lenbach House in Munich exhibited some Kraftwerk 3-D pieces in Autumn 2011. Kraftwerk performed three concerts to open the exhibit.|$|E
