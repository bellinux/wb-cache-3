5|$|The carrier leased two Boeing 777-200ER {{aircraft}} from EgyptAir in March 2014. The airline {{plans to}} expand its fleet to 16 aircraft, to allow route expansion. With newly leased Dash 8-Q400 aircraft, the carrier is resuming full swing domestic flights to Cox's Bazar, Jessore, Saidpur, Rajshahi and Barisal in April 2015. The two aircraft, dry leased from Smart Aviation Company {{for a period of}} five years, will also be operated on regional flights to Kolkata and Yangon. Initially it was supposed to resume in November 2013, which Biman failed to as it was unable to find a <b>lessor</b> of aircraft.|$|E
5|$|As of June 2017, Emirates has 48 orders {{outstanding}} {{but due to}} lack {{of space}} in Dubai Airport, it deferred 12 deliveries by one year and will not take any in 2019-20 before replacing its early airliners from 2021: there are open production slots in 2019 and Airbus reduced its production rate at 12 per year for 2017-18. The real backlog is much smaller than the official 107 with 47 uncertain orders: 20 commitments for the A380-specialized <b>lessor</b> Amedeo which commits to production only once aircraft are placed, eight for Qantas which wants to keep its fleet at 12, six for Virgin Atlantic which does not want them anymore and three ex Transaero for finance vehicle Air Accord.|$|E
5|$|BAe {{eventually}} received £450million {{of funding}} from the UK government, well short of the £750million it had originally requested for the design and construction of the wings. The German and French governments also provided funding. Airbus issued subcontracts to companies in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Greece, Italy, India, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, the United States, and the former Yugoslavia. With funding in place, Airbus launched the A330 and A340 programmes on 5 June 1987, {{just prior to the}} Paris Air Show. At that time, the order book stood at 130 aircraft from ten customers, including <b>lessor</b> International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). Of the order total, forty-one were for A330s. In 1989, Asian carrier Cathay Pacific joined the list of purchasers, ordering nine A330s and later increasing this number to eleven.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} finds {{evidence that}} tax factors motivate {{the participants in}} leasing transactions. Tax-arbitrage arguments predict that leasing participants gain when the <b>lessor’s</b> tax rate exceeds that of the lessee. The research employs a sample of effectively tax-exempt REIT <b>lessors</b> to explore alternative leasing motives. Changes in REIT qualification rules are examined to develop an Agency-Cost, and competing Income-Retention Hypothesis for <b>lessors.</b> The rules and changes suggest that REIT management has the incentive, motive and opportunity to make real-estate investments quickly. The evidence developed is consistent with agency-costs arising from {{the possibility that they}} may overpay for properties. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{units were}} ordered by NSB in 1992 as {{replacements}} for the aging Di3, and were particularly {{intended for use}} on the Nordland Line {{and to a lesser}} extent on the Røros Line. Construction was done by Maschinenbau Kiel (MaK) in Kiel, Germany, which was then part of Siemens Schienenfahrzeugtechnik. The class is largely based on the MaK-built DB Class 240, with each unit costing 32 million Norwegian krone (NOK). The first units were delivered in March 1996, one year after schedule, but were plagued with faults. By 1999, the entire order was terminated and the locomotives returned to Germany. They were taken over by locomotive <b>lessor</b> Dispolok and were used by various Germany railway companies. Ownership was taken over by Vossloh in 2003, after which most of the class were leased to German passenger train operator Nord-Ostsee-Bahn. In 2008, three units returned to Norway and are used by Cargolink for freight trains.|$|E

40|$|Why do manufacturer-owned car <b>lessors</b> lose so {{much money}} on leases, despite having {{proprietary}} information unavailable to other <b>lessors?</b> This paper explores how conflicts in organizational focus within vertically integrated firms can hurt subsidiary performance. To examine this, I identify {{the differences between the}} reaction of the captive leasing subsidiaries of automobile manufacturers to product and market characteristics and the reaction of their independent leasing competitors. While independent <b>lessors</b> write contracts that reflect risk from obsolescence and durability concerns, captives clearly pursue a second agenda from their corporate parents—the use of lease subsidization to sell unwanted vehicles. And while intentional lease subsidization may ultimately benefit the manufacturer, the organizational focus of car manufacturers on sales and market share has the additional effect of hindering the captive subsidiary’s ability to account for risk in lease contracts even when subsidization is unnecessary. I find evidence that unlike their independent competitors, captive <b>lessors</b> fail to adjust lease terms to variation i...|$|R

One was subsequently returned to the <b>lessor</b> and a third Model 200 placed into service in order that the two aircraft used {{would have the same}} cockpit layout. The two aircraft were replaced by eight civilian-operated 90 Model King Airs in 1995.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 Ansett Worldwide was rebranded as AWAS. A company media release {{issued to}} {{coincide}} with the rebranding stated that the company had outlived its association with a failed airline, hence the dropping of the Ansett name. In the industry it was known that some customers had shown a reluctance to deal with Ansett Worldwide, perceiving that the aircraft available were ex-Ansett Airlines aircraft that had been sitting idle since the airline had ceased operations, despite assurances from the <b>lessor</b> that this was not true.|$|E
25|$|The KCERR {{connection}} was still less than ideal, and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit company, which {{ended up as}} the <b>lessor</b> of both the KCERR and B roads, negotiated a more direct subway route under Flatbush Avenue as part of Contract 4 of the Dual Contracts of 1913. Construction of this new connection indirectly contributed to the worst rapid transit wreck in world history, known as the Malbone Street Wreck or Brighton Beach Line Accident when, on November 1, 1918, a five-car wooden elevated train left the tracks and crashed {{into one of the}} new tunnel walls, killing at least 93.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that the Security by Means of Movable Property Act excludes the <b>lessor’s</b> hypothec in respect of property purchased in terms of a hire purchase agreement.

25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a Boeing 757-225 originally delivered to Eastern Air Lines in February 1985 and registered as N516EA. It was powered by two Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4 engines. After Eastern's bankruptcy and subsequent liquidation in 1991, the {{aircraft was}} stored at the Mojave Air and Space Port {{for more than}} a year. It was purchased by Aeronautics Leasing in April 1992, and then leased to Canadian airline Nationair in May 1992, and stayed with the airline until its demise the following year. It was leased again by the same <b>lessor</b> in July 1993 to Birgenair and then sub-leased to International Caribbean Airways in December 1994, and Birgenair operated the airframe until it crashed.|$|E
25|$|Curzon was {{involved}} in several legal cases. In 1894 his financial failure {{was the subject of}} a successful court action against him. In 1901 he and Charles Hawtrey were jointly sued for slander by a disgruntled actor; they won the case. In 1910 Curzon appeared in court in two separate cases, a dispute with the <b>lessor</b> of his theatre over tax liabilities and in another slander case, this time as plaintiff, against an acquaintance who falsely alleged that Curzon left his first wife penniless after their divorce in 1909. Curzon, who in fact allowed his ex-wife £25 a week (equivalent to about £2,000 in 2007 values), won the case but was awarded only nominal damages.|$|E
25|$|In the end, {{options for}} the {{financing}} of the purchase came down to two companies, Westpac and Allco Leasing. One {{of the more interesting}} notes to the Allco proposal was the nature of the financing arrangements it was proposing. At the time of the proposed financing deal, interest rates in Australia were around 16-17%, placing a significant burden on companies in their business dealings. To work around this, Allco proposed a financing structure that involved a cross-border financing arrangement in Japan. It also required the establishment of a special purposes <b>lessor</b> company, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, to minimise withholding tax liabilities from the Japanese and Australian taxation agencies. Allco refused to release specific information on the proposed structure, due to its policy prohibiting the release of specific details of this financing arrangement until it had secured a mandate for their services.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, King of Tonga Taufa'ahau Tupou IV {{visited the}} British Aerospace factory in Woodford, leading to hopes with the {{manufacturer}} that Tonga would purchase the British Aerospace ATP. However, {{the government of}} Tonga and the Tonga Commodities Board purchased a CASA 212 and Britten Norman Islander with which domestic flights could be started. Flights to Pago Pago (American Samoa) and Apia (Western Samoa) were begun with the CASA in 1986. As airfields in Vavaʻu, Haʻapai, ʻEua and the Niuas were upgraded, the airline upgraded the inter-island aircraft. In 1989 the airline leased two de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters to replace the CASA and Islander, and after the initial lease period, purchased the aircraft the <b>lessor,</b> Guinness Peat Aviation. In June 1991, the name was changed from Friendly Island Airways to Royal Tongan Airlines, and international services were begun with a Boeing 737-200 which was leased from Solomon Airlines from Tongatapu to Auckland, New Zealand. The airline was considering acquiring a Douglas DC-8 in order to operate flights to Australia, New Zealand and Honolulu, however this didn't eventuate and in 1994 the airline entered into a codeshare agreement with Polynesian Airlines on routes to Sydney, Honolulu and Los Angeles.|$|E
