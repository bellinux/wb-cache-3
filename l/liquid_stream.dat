40|$|Graduation date: 1982 A {{high speed}} motion neutron {{radiography}} system has been developed at Oregon State University which is capable of taking high speed neutron radiographs of events which occur {{on the order of}} one to two milliseconds or more. This system was used previously to demonstrate the application of {{high speed motion}} neutron radiography techniques to two phase flow and to the burning of solid propellants. Results of this effort showed the burning patterns and relative distributions of the propellant and gases during the burning of these propellants. This system has been modified and the techniques adapted and further developed for the investigation of similar phenomena which occur with the burning of liquid propellants. The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate the feasibility of using the new system and techniques for the investigation of <b>liquid</b> <b>streams</b> which were used to simulate the injection of liquid propellants into a pressurized steel chamber. Examples of the application of these new techniques to <b>liquid</b> <b>streams</b> injected into an unpressurized steel chamber are presented. The high speed system is capable of taking neutron radiography movies at frame rates up to about 11, 000 frames per second, although about 5000 frames per second proved to be adequate for <b>liquid</b> <b>streams.</b> In order to use the high speed system for <b>liquid</b> <b>streams</b> several modifications and improvements were investigated, especially with regards to the synchronization method.
