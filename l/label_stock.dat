50|$|When {{printing}} on continuous <b>label</b> <b>stock,</b> {{there is}} a tendency for the print location to shift slightly from label to label. To ensure registration of the print area with the target media, many label printers use a sensor that detects a gap, notch, line or perforation between labels. This allows the printer to adjust the intake of <b>label</b> <b>stock</b> so that the print aligns correctly with the media.|$|E

Too much tension can cause the liner to break, which requires the machine to be rethreaded.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{supplement}} the takings in the shop itself, Davies also set up an independent wholesale arm of the business, through which he would promote up and coming talent. Many larger record retailers throughout the north-west of England such as HMV, Virgin Records and Our Price bought most of their independent <b>label</b> <b>stock</b> from Probe. The business became successful enough to eventually set up its own record label. Initially called simply Probe Records, it was re-branded Probe Plus {{in order to avoid}} confusion between the retail shop and the record label. The decision of which bands and musicians to sign up to the label was a collaboration between Geoff Davies and two friends, Bolton-born writer Andrew Kenyon-Smith and DJ John Peel.|$|E
5000|$|Applicators {{advance the}} <b>label</b> <b>stock</b> over the peeler plate until {{a portion of}} the label, called the [...] "flag," [...] is {{extended}} into the path of the oncoming package. When the package engages the label flag, the label web is advanced to match the speed of the package and label is either tamped or wiped on to assure adhesion.Proper alignment of the label on the package depends on sensors that sense the location/orientation of the package and label sensors that detect the location of the label edge. Package sensors can be a variety of Position sensors, often optical sensors or Ultrasonic sensors. Label sensors are usually Photoelectric sensors because they are inexpensive. But clear labels cannot be detected by photoelectric sensors. Capacitive and ultrasonic technologies are used for clear label detection.|$|E
5000|$|Feed-Roller: This {{actually}} {{is the first}} patented method used in the semi-automatic label dispenser to advance the label forward. The label material is fed over the peeling edge, then through a feed-roller assembly which pinches the label material between a metal roller and a rubber roller. The metal roller is held in place with bushings pressed into aluminum blocks which hinge on a rod supported between two sideframes. The blocks use springs on each side to hold tension against the rubber roller (driven by a motor), and this also holds the tracking of the label material {{to the side of}} the machine with the sensor. Using this method <b>label</b> <b>stock</b> up to 16" [...] width can be advanced and tracked perfectly. The disadvantage/advantage to this method is waste is not collected, but pushed out through the rear of the machine where it can be fed into a trash receptacle.|$|E

5000|$|Over the years, channel 11 has won many news awards, and was {{the first}} {{independent}} station to win a New York-area Emmy Award for outstanding newscast, first earning the statuette in 1979 and again in 1983. It was a significant comeback for a news operation that was accused of falsifying news reports in the late 1960s, such as <b>labeling</b> <b>stock</b> footage as being shown [...] "via satellite", and claiming a voice report was live from Prague when it had actually been made from a pay telephone in Manhattan. As a result, Forum Communications - led by future PBS and NBC News president Lawrence Grossman - approached the Federal Communications Commission to challenge WPIX Inc.'s license to operate channel 11. WPIX and the Daily News prevailed in 1979 after years of litigation. On June 5, 2000, WPIX launched a weekday morning newscast, the WB11 Morning News (now the PIX 11 Morning News), which has grown to challenge the established network morning programs as well as its more direct competitor, WNYW's Good Day New York.|$|R
50|$|The table {{shows that}} stock A goes down {{half as much}} as the market when the market goes down and up twice as much as the market when the market goes up. Stock B, on the other hand, goes down twice as much as the market when the market goes down and up {{half as much as}} the market when the market goes up. Most investors would <b>label</b> <b>stock</b> B as more risky. In fact, stock A has better return in every {{possible}} case. However, according to the capital asset pricing model, stock A and B would have the same beta, meaning that theoretically, investors would require the same rate of return for both stocks. This is an illustration of how using standard beta might mislead investors. The dual-beta model, in contrast, takes into account this issue and differentiates downside beta from upside beta, or downside risk from upside risk, and thus allows investors to make better informed investing decisions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{print engine}} {{can be taken}} from an {{industrial}} table top printer, {{it can be a}} specifically designed module that can be [...] "bolted" [...] onto an applicator or it can be a proprietary element constructed by the printer applicator manufacturer. A print engine’s primary function is to accept data from a computer and print the data onto a label for application. This printing can be accomplished using either the direct thermal method or the thermal transfer method. Both methods heat up very fine elements (up to 600 per inch) on a print head. Direct thermal burns the image onto the face of specially designed <b>label</b> <b>stock.</b> This is the preferred method for shipping labels and is also very popular in Europe. The thermal transfer process utilizes a ribbon coated with wax, resin, or a hybrid of the two. It is then heated and melted onto the surface of the label substrate. Thermal transfer is the most popular method in the United States. The printer knows what to print via data communication from an outside software package, much like common inkjet printers. The software delivers data formatted in a specific layout and the printer reads the format based on its own driver.|$|E

40|$|The thesis was {{conducted}} in order to investigate the future demand of label papers in the Chinese market. The Chinese paper market is an attractive segment for many local and inter-national producers and the information gathered for the thesis is relevant for understanding the market dynamics. Initially, {{the plan was to}} utilize the Delphi method. However, due to changes and unwillingness to answer sensitive market information the possibility to conduct a Delphi study was limited. This transitioned the method to focus primarily on secondary re-search, such as the Asian Release Liner Market Study. This was combined with an interview to analyze the validity of information and support the primary research method. After research {{was conducted}}, the understanding of growth in Asia and primarily China for release liners and labelstock was obtained. This was coupled with the examination of market structure, compet-itors, and the marketing environment to gain a clear understanding of the <b>label</b> <b>stock</b> market. From the research, it can be highlighted that UPM is in a strong position currently, and is strengthening their position through capacity investments in China. Also, the growth outloo...|$|E
