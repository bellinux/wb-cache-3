5|$|Since {{the total}} closure of urban <b>landfills</b> in 1986, rubbish from Lam Tin is first {{transferred}} to a treatment plant in Kowloon Bay where it is compressed, and then to South East New Territories Landfill (新界東南堆填區) where it is disposed of.|$|E
5|$|Early garbage {{collection}} in Scarborough {{was performed by}} individual communities and dumped in local <b>landfills</b> which were located in nearby ravines. In 1967 waste collection was reorganized. Local <b>landfills</b> were closed {{and most of the}} garbage was directed to a new landfill on Beare Road in eastern Scarborough. This dump was eventually closed in 1981. A waste transfer site was constructed near Markham Road and Sheppard Avenue East. From there garbage was trucked to the Keele Valley dump in Vaughan and the Brock Road dump in Pickering. In 2002 the Keele Valley landfill was closed. As part of Toronto's overall waste management, garbage was then trucked to Michigan. This arrangement lasted until 2010 when garbage was sent to the new Green Lane landfill site in Elgin County.|$|E

50|$|<b>Landfill</b> {{mining and}} {{reclamation}} (LFMR) {{is a process}} whereby solid wastes which have previously been <b>landfilled</b> are excavated and processed. The function of <b>landfill</b> mining {{is to reduce the}} amount of <b>landfill</b> mass encapsulated within the closed <b>landfill</b> and/or temporarily remove hazardous material to allow protective measures to be taken before the <b>landfill</b> mass is replaced. In the process, mining recovers valuable recyclable materials, a combustible fraction, soil, and <b>landfill</b> space. The aeration of the <b>landfill</b> soil is a secondary benefit regarding the <b>landfill's</b> future use. The combustible fraction is useful for the generation of power. The overall appearance of the <b>landfill</b> mining procedure is a sequence of processing machines laid out in a functional conveyor system. The operating principle is to excavate, sieve and sort the <b>landfill</b> material.|$|R

50|$|A <b>landfill</b> {{compaction}} vehicle has {{two main}} functions: {{to spread the}} waste evenly in layers over the <b>landfill,</b> and to compact waste to reduce its volume and help stabilize the <b>landfill.</b> Proper waste compacting includes the process of using a steel wheeled/drum <b>landfill</b> compactor to shred, tear and press together various items in the waste stream so they consume a minimal volume of <b>landfill</b> airspace. The higher the compaction rate, the more trash the <b>landfill</b> can receive and store. This will also reduce landslides, cave-ins and {{minimize the risk of}} explosions of <b>landfill</b> gas (see <b>landfill</b> gas migration).|$|R
40|$|In Australia a {{significant}} number of <b>landfill</b> waste disposal sites do not incorporate measures for the collection and treatment of <b>landfill</b> gas. This includes many old/former <b>landfill</b> sites, rural <b>landfill</b> sites, non-putrescible solid waste and inert waste <b>landfill</b> sites, where <b>landfill</b> gas generation is low and it is not commercially viable to extract and beneficially utilize the <b>landfill</b> gas. Previous research has demonstrated that biofiltration has the potential to degrade methane in <b>landfill</b> gas, however, the microbial processes can be affected by many local conditions and factors including moisture content, temperature, nutrient supply, including the availability of oxygen and methane, and the movement of gas (oxygen and methane) to/from the micro-organisms. A field scale trial is being undertaken at a <b>landfill</b> site in Sydney, Australia, to investigate passive drainage and biofiltration of <b>landfill</b> gas as a means of managing <b>landfill</b> gas emissions at low to moderate gas generation <b>landfill</b> sites. The design and construction of the trial is described and the experimental results will provide in-depth knowledge on the application of passive gas drainage and <b>landfill</b> gas biofiltration under Sydney (Australian) conditions, including the performance of recycled materials for the management of <b>landfill</b> gas emissions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|Residual lead in soil {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been {{thought that the}} more polluted an area is with various contaminants, {{the more likely it}} is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated <b>landfills,</b> or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.|$|E

5|$|In {{the western}} Mojave Desert, human {{settlement}} and land development {{have led to}} an estimated 16-fold increase in the common raven population over 25 years. Towns, <b>landfills,</b> sewage treatment plants and artificial ponds create sources {{of food and water}} for scavenging birds. Ravens also find nesting sites in utility poles and ornamental trees, and are attracted to roadkill on highways. The explosion in the common raven population in the Mojave has raised concerns for the desert tortoise, a threatened species. Common ravens prey upon juvenile tortoises, which have soft shells and move slowly. Despite this, and there being no danger of extinction, the US Congress added ravens to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in 1971. Plans to control the population have included shooting and trapping birds, as well as contacting landfill operators to ask that they reduce the amount of exposed garbage. A hunting bounty as a method of control was historically used in Finland from the mid-18th century until 1923. Culling has taken place to a limited extent in Alaska, where the population increase in common ravens is threatening the vulnerable Steller's eider (Polysticta stelleri).|$|E
5|$|On September 23, {{just days}} after the storm moved through, President George W.

The declaration designated the affected citizens eligible for grants to pay for temporary housing, house repairs, and serious disaster-related expenses. The declaration also allowed for federal funding for 75% of the repair cost for replacing public facilities. By two months after the storm, 659residents had applied for disaster aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), totaling to just over $1million (2003USD, $1.1million 2006USD). 141small businesses applied for loans, totaling to around $2.5million (2003USD, $2.75million 2006USD). In addition, FEMA received 183applications for public assistance, which would be used for rebuilding public roads and buildings. Over twentyvolunteer organizations met to establish a long-term committee to find resources for disaster recovery needs. One goal sought by the committee was to find a permanent housing solution for every one who was displaced from their houses from the storms. Volunteers also helped remove ruined appliances and furniture to local <b>landfills,</b> totaling to more than 300tons. State and county governments in Delaware purchased 171homes following the damage in the Glenville area, the highest number of houses purchased in the state due to storm damage.

40|$|The {{disposal}} {{of the solid}} wastes in <b>landfill</b> sites should be properly monitored by analyzing samples from soil, water, and <b>landfill</b> gases within the <b>landfill</b> site. Nevertheless, ground monitoring systems require intensive efforts and cost. Furthermore, ground monitoring {{may be difficult to}} be achieved in large geographic extent. Remote sensing technology has been introduced for waste disposal management and monitoring effects of the <b>landfill</b> sites on the environment. In this paper, two case studies are presented in the Trail Road <b>landfill,</b> Ottawa, Canada and the Al-Jleeb <b>landfill,</b> Al-Farwanyah, Kuwait to evaluate the use of multi-temporal remote sensing images to monitor the <b>landfill</b> sites. The work objectives are: 1) to study the usability of multi-temporal Landsat images for <b>landfill</b> site monitoring by studying the land surface temperature (LST) in the Trail Road <b>landfill,</b> 2) to investigate the relationship between the LST and the amount of the <b>landfill</b> gas emitted in the Trail Road <b>landfill,</b> and 3) to use the multi-temporal LST images to detect the suspicious dumping areas within the Al-Jleeb <b>landfill</b> site. Free archive of multi-temporal Landsat images are obtained from the USGS EarthExplorer. The Landsat images are then atmospherically corrected and the LST images are derived from the thermal band of the corrected Landsat images. In the Trail Road <b>landfill,</b> the results reveal that the LST of the <b>landfill</b> site is always higher than the air temperature by 10 ° C in average as well as the surroundings. A correlation is also observed between the recorded emitted methane (CH 4) from the ground monitoring stations and the LST derived from the Landsat images.
