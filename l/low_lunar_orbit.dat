40|$|Weak GNSS signals {{could be}} {{exploited}} in future lunar missions to increase navigation robustness, flexibility and autonomy. In these applications GNSS reception suffers from very low signal levels, partial visibility of the GNSS sources and unfavourable geometry, {{making use of}} either secondary lobes or the signals’ spill over around the Earth mask. Objective of a recent ESA study was to evaluate the challenges of such a navigation technique using GPS and future Galileo reception with carrier to signal levels as low as 10 to 15 dBHz. Investigated mission phases included transfer <b>orbit,</b> <b>low</b> <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits,</b> <b>lunar</b> ascent and descent as well as surface operation and navigation at the Lagrangian points. The paper presents the approach pursued during the study and shares its main findings, showing first that GNSS can be actually considered as an available and extremely useful navigation resource in all phases, even if part of the missions, and specifically <b>low</b> <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits</b> and descent, will require a mandatory aiding form other sensors. Moreover, external aiding {{in terms of the}} content of the data message has been envisaged in order to adopt a snapshot architecture for the receiver and to overcome limits in tracking loops with extremely low carrier to noise ratio. A proof of concept for the proposed receiver has been built and tested in different simulated scenarios. As a final result, a multi-constellation GNSS receiver software can be considered a suitable option to enable autonomous navigation in lunar missions, allowing for large savings in the expensive – and poorly available – ground-based tracking network...|$|R

50|$|While the HLV was {{designed}} to provide crew and cargo missions to the ISS, its primary aim {{would have been to}} replace the Ares I - Ares V lunar architecture.

All of the aforementioned uses of a lunar base foresee the requirement for a lunar shuttle to operate from the lunar surface to one or more orbiting space stations located in <b>low</b> <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits</b> (LLO). The Utah State University lunar shuttle design is baslined for implementation after a mature lunar base has been established. The shuttle is designed to operate between the lunar base and a space station located in a 400 -km-altitude orbit. This orbit was chosen with reference to Apollo experience, which has indicated that very low orbits, on the order of 100 -km, may be unstable over periods of many months. After a thorough investigation of the anticipated needs and production capabilities of a lunar base, several design requirements were placed upon the shuttle. These requirements are (1) maximum use of lunar-derived propellant; (2) modularity and payload versatility; (3) two-way transport of 25 -metric-ton cargo; (4) human transport capability; (5) satellite servicing; and (6) 3000 -kg mass budget...|$|R

The conceived beamed energy propulsion devices generally provide low thrust (tens of pounds to hundreds of pounds); therefore, they are typically suggested for cargo transportation. For the baseline scenario, these propulsion system can provide propulsion between the following nodes: (1) low Earth orbit to geosynchronous Earth orbit; (2) low Earth orbit to low lunar orbit; (3) <b>low</b> <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> to low Mars orbit [...] only solar thermal; and (4) lunar surface to <b>low</b> <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> [...] only laser thermal...|$|E

The lunar gravity field strongly perturbs low altitude orbits, so an effective orbit maintenance strategy is needed.

A maneuver strategy can be designed which optimizes the propellant required for long term orbit sustenance. The long term requirements dominate the total propellant required for orbit control. Additional propellant {{may be required to}} offset the impact of medium period gravity field effects.

40|$|The {{exploration}} of space {{has so far been}} attempted only through a limited sequence of missions, not strictly linked among them in terms of accumulation of achieved experience and hardware utilization. The paper presents an innovative approach to the {{exploration of}} regions beyond Low Earth Orbit, which is assumed to occur through an orderly sequence of interlinked missions, targeted to specific locations, where human outposts are put in place, to progressively enlarge the boundaries of human presence in the Solar System. Each human outpost is built "on the shoulders" of the precedent one, through physical transfer at the new location of all or {{at least some of the}} major building blocks of the previous outpost. Dedicated building blocks may also be considered to build up the final architecture of the new outpost. The new approach proposes therefore the development of an "Itinerant Human Outpost" for future space exploration, growing eventually in complexity and transforming itself. At each step of the space exploration journey the outpost is utilized as technology and operation test-bed to prepare the "next step". The sequence of locations starts with an Equatorial Low Earth Orbit Human Outpost. Next locations are Earth-Moon Lagrangian Points, Near Earth Asteroids Region, <b>Low</b> <b>Lunar</b> <b>Orbits</b> and Martian Orbits to finally build up Martian human outposts in Low Martian Orbits or on one Martian natural satellite. The overall scenario can be considered the "Grand Tour of the Earth Neighbours", performed by the "Itinerant Human Outposts", whose successive multiple utilization and growth potential have to be taken into account as design requirements of each building block. The practice of introducing in the design the "Revolutionary Approach" of the " 6 R Space Systems", i. e. the "Repairable, Refurbishable, Replaceable, Reconfigurable, Retrievable and Reusable Space Systems", has to be adopted as well, in order to optimize in the long term the costs of the outposts building up and of their operations, even if in the front end such an approach requires more complex and costing solutions. The paper describes into some detail the proposed new approach, establishes the main requirements and defines the System of Systems Architecture of the first Human Outpost in Equatorial Low Earth Orbit. The significant endeavours, required to sustain over quite a long period of time such an initiative, are going to offer to new generations perspectives that will act as catalyst of economical growth and will encourage the involvement of the Private Secto...|$|R

40|$|In 2003, NASA {{solicited}} {{proposals for}} a robotic {{exploration of the}} lunar surface. Submissions were requested for a lunar sample return mission from the South Pole-Aitken Basin. The basin is of interest because it is thought to contain some of the oldest accessible rocks on the lunar surface. A mission is under study that will land a spacecraft in the basin, collect a sample of rock fragments, and return the sample to Earth. Because the Aitken Basin is {{on the far side}} of the Moon, the lander will require a communications relay satellite (CRS) to maintain contact with the Earth during its surface operation. Design of the CRS's orbit is therefore critical. This paper describes a mission design which includes potential transfer and mission orbits, required changes in velocity, orbital parameters, and mission dates. Several different <b>low</b> <b>lunar</b> polar <b>orbits</b> are examined to compare their availability to the lander versus the distance over which they must communicate. In addition, polar orbits are compared to a halo orbit about the Earth-Moon L 2 point, which would permit continuous communication at a cost of increased fuel requirements and longer transmission distances.
