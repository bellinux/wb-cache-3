5|$|Captained by Commander Geoffrey Layton, her post-completion trials {{lasted for}} five months as {{she was used to}} {{evaluate}} steam power for submarine use. Much was <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> operation of steam submarines, which helped the subsequent design of the steam-powered K-class fleet submarines. She proved to be very unstable while surfacing, presumably because she could not pump the water out of her controlled free-flooding spaces quickly enough in the upper part of her double hull. These problems, coupled with {{the fact that she was}} too slow to work with the fleet as originally envisioned, meant that she was impossible to make into an effective warship, and she was laid up after her trials.|$|E

5|$|Having <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> block-booking studio {{system that}} almost {{guaranteed}} the studios huge profits, Cagney {{was determined to}} spread the wealth.

His insistence on no more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors—even teenagers—regularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn out more films. This experience was an integral reason for his involvement in forming the Screen Actors Guild in 1933.|$|E
5|$|In 1670, Mu'azzam {{organised}} {{an insurgency}} to overthrow Aurangzeb and proclaim himself the Mughal emperor. This plan {{may have been}} hatched at the instigation of the Marathas, and Mu'azzam's own inclinations and sincerity are difficult to gauge. Anyway, Aurangzeb <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> plot and sent Mu'azzam's mother Begum Nawab Bai (a Muslim Rajput princess by birth) to dissuade Mu'azzam from rebellion. Nawab Bai brought Mu'azzam back to the Mughal court, where {{he spent the next}} several years under Aurangzeb's supervision. However, Mu'azzam revolted in 1680 on the pretext of protesting Aurangzeb's treatment of Rajput chiefs. Once again, Aurangzeb followed his previous policy to dissuade Mu'azzam with gentleness and then to place him under greater vigilance.|$|E

5|$|Smythe {{continued}} to own horses through the 1930s, but he sold them in 1940, {{when he made}} plans {{to fight in the}} Second World War. He did not re-enter the racing business until 1954. In 1951, Smythe bought land for a farm in Caledon, Ontario, originally looking for a new location for a gravel pit. At first he kept only cattle, but in 1954 he decided to get back into owning race horses, in partnership with Larkin Maloney, and an area was set aside to keep horses. Smythe <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> business and went into breeding, buying mares in foal from top thoroughbred lines, and hiring future Hall of Fame trainer Yonnie Starr.|$|E

Immediately, Devavrata rushed to the hut of the fisherman-chief and begged for Satyvati's hand on his father's behalf. The fisherman repeated his condition and told Devavrata that only Shantanu was worthy of Satyavati; he had rejected marriage proposals from even Brahmarishis like Asita.|$|E
