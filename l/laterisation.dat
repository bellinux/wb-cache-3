2500|$|Thiruvananthapuram {{is built}} on seven hills by the sea shore and is located at [...] on the west coast, near the {{southern}} tip of mainland India. The city situated on the west coast of India, and is bounded by Laccadive Sea to its west and the Western Ghats to its east. The average elevation of the city is [...] above sea level. The Geological Survey of India has identified Thiruvananthapuram as a moderately earthquake-prone urban centre and categorised the city in the Seismic III Zone. Thiruvananthapuram lies on the shores of Karamana and Killi rivers. Vellayani, Thiruvallam and Aakulam backwaters lies in the city. The Soil type in the middle part of the city is dark brown loamy laterite soil high in phosphates. <b>Laterisation</b> {{is a result of the}} heavy rainfall and humid conditions. On western coastal regions of the city, sandy loam soil is found and on eastern hilly parts of the district, rich dark brown loam of granite origin is found.|$|E

It has long been thought that the process of <b>laterisation</b> involves the formation of hydrous iron oxides and their subsequent dehydration over geological time. It is of interest to the engineer to accelerate this process, but little success has been reported hitherto. The present study has shown that in the presence of activated silica and fine iron oxide, clay minerals as diverse as montmorillonite and kaolinite can be induced to yield very strong compacts, almost comparable with brick, {{in a matter of days}} at ambient temperatures. After extensive investigation of the optimal conditions for thermal stabilisation and activation of clays and soils, the optimal process finally developed involved heating a fine-grained soil to a temperature high enough to destroy its water sensitivity, adding finely divided iron oxide, and then introducing a sodium silicate and/or sodium hydroxide solution. After compaction the mixture sets into a hard material. The products responsible for this stabilisation have been shown to be strong, durable, and water resistant. They have been identified by X-ray and electron probe as a series of complex iron silicates (having various substitutions); five of the major compounds responsible for the stabilisation appear to be hitherto unreported in the literature. Although the reaction mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, it seems possible that it will provide important insights into the practicability of achieving accelerated <b>laterisation</b> in clay soils, and permit the development of a range of new durable and strong products based on ordinary soil rather than pure clay minerals; since the method of preparation appears to be insensitive to many natural impurities, and the quality of product may even be improved thereby...|$|E

X-ray diffraction analyses showed that the soil comprised kaolinite, quartz, gibbsite and haematite. Chemical analyses showed there was no amorphous material present in the soil. The results of electron scanning microscopy revealed that sesquioxides coat and bind the clayey constituents of the lateritic soil into porous micro-aggregations. Analyses of the grain size distribution and other physical properties indicated that the soil was not homogeneous within the laterite zone. Atterberg limit test results for the soil plotted anomalously below the Casagrande A-line. There were {{significant differences between the}} values of plasticity index determined for air-dried compared with oven-dried samples. High values for both the liquid and plastic limits were due to the water retention capacity of porous micro-aggregations in the soil. This was correlated with the degree of <b>laterisation,</b> which depends on the ambient climate, topography and vegetation of the are...|$|E
