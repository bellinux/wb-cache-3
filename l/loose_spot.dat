When Spot can't find money for rent, Karl always finds a way to put some <b>loose</b> change in <b>Spot's</b> path without him noticing. He also protects them from more harsh dangers as well, though for the context of the comic's light tone, these {{instances}} are incredibly rare.|$|R

"Why, sir, I {{am afraid}} that the rains and the thaw together, have thrown so much water into the river, all at once, as it might be, as to have raised the ice and broken it <b>loose,</b> in <b>spots,</b> from the shores. When this happens above, before the ice has {{disappeared}} below, it sometimes causes dams to form, which heap up such a weight as to break the whole plain of ice far below it, and thus throw cakes over cakes until walls twenty or thirty feet high are formed. This has not happened yet, therefore there is no immediate danger; but by bending your heads low, {{you can see that}} such a break has just taken place about half a mile below us." ...|$|R

He was a {{stranger}} in the locality, so had no means of knowing that summer homes were always burgled on Long Island every year, as regularly as the coming of the mosquito and the advent of the jelly-fish. It was one of the local industries. People left summer homes lying about <b>loose</b> in lonely <b>spots,</b> and you just naturally got in through the cellar window. Such was the Long Islander's simple creed.|$|R
50|$|Ground cover must be {{evaluated}} for temperature differentials (i.e., anomalies {{such as high}} grass or surface debris), as to how it may affect the surface condition of the test area. Of the three methods of energy transfer, radiation is the method that has the most profound effect upon {{the ability of the}} surface to transfer energy. The ability of a material to radiate energy is measured by the emissivity of the material. This is defined as the ability of the material to release energy as compared to a perfect blackbody radiator. This is strictly a surface property. It normally exhibits itself in higher values for rough surfaces and lower values for smooth surfaces. For example, rough concrete may have an emissivity of 0.95 while a shiny piece of tinfoil may have an emissivity of only 0.05. In practical terms, this means that when looking at large areas of ground cover, the engineer in charge of testing must be aware of differing surface textures caused by such things as broom roughed spots, tire rubber tracks, oil <b>spots,</b> <b>loose</b> sand and dirt on the surface and the height of grassy areas.|$|R
5000|$|On April 16, 1931, {{during the}} height of the Great Depression, the locally owned and {{operated}} State Bank of Concrete was robbed at gunpoint and its employees taken hostage. Two men entered the bank during operating hours brandishing guns and taking $4,491.00 in cash from the bank's vault. After the money had been obtained, the two men then forced bank president George Campbell, bank clerk Ada Seabury, and bank customer George Harper into a car with them and sped away. When town residents <b>spotted</b> <b>loose</b> dollar bills in front of the bank on Main Street and noticed that there was no one inside the bank, town marshal Charlie Bagnell was notified. After a quick investigation, Bagnell contacted [...] "downriver" [...] law enforcement by telephone about the robbery and missing bank employees. The three kidnapped hostages were subsequently released by their captors at an area approximately four miles west of town on the highway known as the [...] "rock-cut" [...] and were soon after picked up by a passing motorist. The three gave descriptions of the criminals to Bagnell, who relayed the information to the county sheriff.|$|R
2500|$|The use of {{magnesium}} chloride on roads remains controversial. [...] Advocates claim (1) Cleaner air, {{which leads to}} better health as fugitive dust can cause health problems in the young, elderly and people with respiratory conditions; and (2) Greater safety through improved road conditions, including increased driver visibility and decreased risks caused by <b>loose</b> gravel, soft <b>spots,</b> road roughness and flying rocks. It reduces foreign sediment in nearby surface waters [...] (dust that settles in creeks and streams), helps prevent stunted crop growth caused by clogged pores in plants, and keeps vehicles and property cleaner. Other studies show the use of salts for road deicing or dust suppressing can contribute substantial amounts of chloride ions to runoff from surface of roads treated with the compounds. The salts MgCl2 (and CaCl2) are very soluble in water and will dissociate. The salts, when used on road surfaces, will dissolve during wet weather and be transported into the groundwater through infiltration and/or runoff into surface water bodies. [...] Groundwater infiltration can be [...] a problem and the chloride ion in drinking water is considered a problem when concentrations exceed 250mg/l. [...] It is therefore regulated by the EPAâ€™s drinking water standards. The chloride concentration in the groundwater or surface water depends on several factors including: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{on-going}} {{debate over}} the influence of investor demand on spot commodity prices largely attempts to assess this influence by measuring the growth in investor demand in recent years. Given the serious data problems that plague such analyses, this article pursues another approach {{in the hope of}} providing useful insights into the impact of investor demand on spot commodity prices. It focuses on the mechanisms by which investor demand affects spot prices, and in particular on two questions. First, how does an increase in investor demand on the futures markets affect the spot market and spot price? Second, when investor demand is increasing and pushing a commodity's price up, do physical stocks of the commodity also have to be rising, as economists and others widely assume? On the first question, the article concludes that a surge in investor demand raising prices on the futures markets will have a direct and comparable effect on the spot market prices when these markets are in strong contango. However, when markets are in weak contango or backwardation, price movements in the futures markets have a much <b>looser</b> effect on <b>spot</b> prices. As a result, changes in investor demand on the futures markets may have little or no influence on spot prices {{in the absence of a}} strong contango. Instead, changes in fundamentals (that is, producer supply and consumer demand) and possibly changes in investor demand taking place directly on the spot market largely determine the spot price at such times. On the second question, the article shows that investor demand can be pushing up a commodity's price even when investor stocks are falling, despite the widespread presumption to the contrary.
