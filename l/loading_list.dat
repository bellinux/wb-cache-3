40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe industrial mission of Destroyer Tenders (AD) and Repair Ships (AR) {{is to provide}} intermediate level maintenance and repair for supported ships. The Tender and Repair Ship <b>Load</b> <b>List</b> for these ships (AD/AR TARSLL) designates the range (number) and depth (quantity) of repair parts to be carried to support this industrial mission. This thesis details the logical reasoning and mathematical theory used to develop the 1977 AD/AR TARSLL, including {{an analysis of the}} data development, the mathematical inventory model and procedures used, and various assumptions and constraints applied during the process. Actual demand history for the six AD/AR 1 s in the Atlantic fleet for a two year period from 1977 to 1979 was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the <b>load</b> <b>list.</b> The effects of certain assumptions in the model on the <b>load</b> <b>list</b> were analyzed. The proposed changes for the 1980 TARSLL were incorporated in the 1977 TARSLL and evaluated. Also, alternative models and methods of <b>load</b> <b>list</b> development were proposed and evaluated.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPresently, aircraft carriers on deployment request Fleet Issue <b>Load</b> <b>List</b> (FILL) material from supporting AFS ships on a "Fill or Kill" basis. If {{the material is}} available on the AFS, it is issued and delivered to the aircraft carrier during the next underway replenishment (UNREP). If the requested material is not-in-stock (NIS) the requisition is cancelled by the AFS. The aircraft carrier is notified of requisition cancellations during the underway replenishment. The aircraft carrier then cancels the outstanding requisition on its own inventory system, and reorders the material at the next scheduled underway replenishment or from an appropriate Naval Supply Center. This thesis suggests a procedure for an AFS to automatically forward cancelled aircraft carrier requisitions for Fleet Issue <b>Load</b> <b>List</b> material to a Navy Supply Center. During the study information was obtained from several on-site visits to an AFS and an in-depth review of current guidelines and procedures for AFS supply support and aircraft carrier requisitioning procedures. The procedure developed provides the AFS with a method for passing aircraft carrier requisitions for not-in-stock Fleet Issue <b>Load</b> <b>List</b> material, reducing requisition lead-time and aircraft carrier administrative work-load. Additional research is required to evaluate specific implementation problems and actual cost savings. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA mathematical model is developed for determining an optimum submarine tender <b>load</b> <b>list</b> for the POLARIS (FBM) weapon system. Military essentiality of spare parts and the stowage {{capacity of the}} tender play prominent roles {{in the development of}} the model. The measure of all effectiveness which is maximized is the average number of demands filled over a given period of time. This is equivalent to minimizing the number of stockouts of an item. An example of the use of the model is included for the case where the demand for items is characterized by the normal distribution. The paper includes a paper flow chart and program to aid in implementing the model [...] The authors wish to express their appreciation for the assistance and encouragement given them by Associate Professor Julius H.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe USNS Mercy will shortly {{be accepted by}} the U. S. Navy. While the conversion of an oil tanker into a first class floating hospital has received the appropriate attention, the logistical support of the Mercy has not. This thesis looks at the provisioning and resupply of the Mercy with the objective of identifying a method of stratifying medical stores by an Essentiality Index. What is presented is a logical and reliable means to rank medical consumables by the degree of cure provided to a projected patient stream. This thesis recommends that an Essentiality Index be calculated for all medical consumables projected by the Combat Zone Assessment Requirements and Sets, Kits and Outfits models. Utilization of this Essentiality Index will positively impact the provisioning of the USNS Mercy, improve the range and depth of medical consumables listed in the Fleet Issue <b>Load</b> <b>List,</b> and, in general provide a tool to better manage medical consumables throughout the supply system.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis improves {{the method of}} determining inventory levels for commodities (provisions, high usage <b>load</b> <b>list</b> consumables, and ships store merchandise) managed by the Sixth Fleet on station AFS. Historical demand generated by ships deployed to the Sixth Fleet is used to develop two models, the Lognormal Model and the Point Estimate Model. Improvement is achieved by considering each item's variance in demand. The Lognormal Model computes sample standard deviations for each item and provides the more accurate results. The Point Estimate Model uses regression to estimate a standard deviation for groups of items. Although the Point Estimate Model is easier for hands-on users to understand it is no easier to implement. The two models are compared against current procedures using {{a second set of}} actual Sixth Fleet data to simulate six months of inventory activity. Satisfied customer demands are improved by five percentage points (from 93 % to 98 %) and end of the month contingency inventory reserves are improved by 30 percentage points (from 65 % to 95 %).
