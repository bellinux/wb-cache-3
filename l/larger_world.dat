5|$|Dragon Quest II {{is noted}} for greatly {{expanding}} upon the gameplay {{of the previous}} game, Dragon Quest. The game {{is the first in}} the series to feature multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, as well as a sailing ship. It also allowed the player to land the ship anywhere, making it possible to explore the entire game world in an open-ended manner. It included other new gameplay features such as weapons which cast spells when used in battles. Compared with its predecessor, Dragon Warrior II offers a wider array of spells and items and a much <b>larger</b> <b>world.</b> The game also expanded the inventory management system of its predecessor by giving each character an individual inventory that holds up to eight items, placing a greater emphasis on conservative item management between the characters. Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line was also the first Dragon Quest game to include a game of chance (played with Lottery Tickets that the player finds), and was also the first Dragon Quest game to use multiple key types and to include travel doors (warp gates).|$|E

25|$|After the Spanish conquest Otomi {{became a}} written {{language}} when friars taught the Otomi {{to write the}} language using the Latin script; the written language of the colonial period is often called Classical Otomi.

500|$|Feeling that Singer's {{efforts in}} Apocalypse to {{establish}} a <b>larger</b> <b>world,</b> similar to the MCU, {{did not meet the}} standards established by Marvel, VanDerWerff noted that unlike Feige's ability to serve as [...] "pseudo-showrunner", Singer is instead [...] "steeped in film and the way movie stories have always been told", so [...] "when it comes time to have Apocalypse dovetail with story threads from the earlier [...] (which was directed by someone else entirely), both Singer's direction and Simon Kinberg's script rely on hackneyed devices and clumsy storytelling", indicating a lack of [...] "the kind of big-picture thinking this sort of mega franchise requires".|$|E
500|$|Dragon Quest II was {{successful}} in Japan; the original Famicom version shipped 2.4 million copies. Later, the game was remade for the Super Famicom and the Game Boy Color and combined with the original Dragon Quest game in a release entitled Dragon Quest I & II. A version of the game for Android and iOS was released in Japan on June 26, 2014 and worldwide on October 9, 2014, as Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line. [...] The game was praised for improving on almost {{all aspects of the}} original, including having better graphics, having a <b>larger</b> <b>world</b> to explore, and more characters to participate in a more dynamic combat system. It was also {{known as one of the}} most difficult Dragon Quest games, especially late game, and retained that reputation despite adjustments made when it was ported to other platforms.|$|E

She questions her faith (another theme {{that runs through the}} novel), and begins to develop a sense of self apart from it, helped in this process by Ged. She wrestles with her contradictory thoughts for a long time; keeping Ged alive would be contrary to all her teachings and the powers she serves, but sacrificing him would be contrary to her developing respect for life. An important moment in this process is when Ged calls her by her true name, and clarifies for her the choice between remaining in the Tombs as Arha and embracing Tenar and stepping into the <b>larger</b> <b>world</b> of Earthsea. Afterwards she has a nightmare about suffocating, a motif Cummins describes as being common to female coming-of-age stories.|$|E
500|$|The game is {{generally}} known for fixing problems {{found in the}} first game, including improvements such as allowing parties of three characters, having a <b>larger</b> <b>world,</b> better graphics, {{and the ability to}} carry more items. Other noted improvements were keys that can be used multiple times and new strategic elements introduced because of larger parties and larger groups of enemies. The game's music is often praised, despite its limited 8-bit capabilities. Considered a classic for the RPG genre, the game is regarded as praiseworthy. Japanese reviews highlighted the Famicom version's difficulty, stemming from issues such as the many traps in the Cave of Rhone, and the final boss's ability to cast a [...] "Healall" [...] spell, and this has led to some critics calling the game [...] "the most difficult Dragon Quest". After Dragon Quest III released, director Koichi Nakamura said [...] "In result, Dragon Quest II received favourable from everybody, but as me creator's side, I feel that I did about only half what I wanted to do." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, Alisha Grauso of Forbes {{discussed}} the series and its ratings, describing {{the show as}} having [...] "never quite been the ratings hit for ABC that the network had hoped it would be...It's hard enough to write a film script that fits within {{the continuity of the}} larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, even harder to do it with a full-length TV season that must act as connective tissue to the <b>larger</b> <b>world</b> while still being its own thing." [...] Grauso opined that the series' ratings may improve if it either focused on trying to be the best series it could be (with fewer connections to the films, like the Marvel-Netflix shows) or on just being [...] "support and tie-in {{to the world of the}} Avengers". Grauso concluded, [...] "The end result for either scenario is that, hopefully, ratings move up and stay up. In the first case, fans might be lost by the disconnect from the MCU, but a stronger storyline and more consistent writing would bring them and new fans back. In the second scenario, fans would tune in every week for fear of missing out on a bit of story that's important to the larger world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fondane {{found himself}} {{opposed to the}} general trend of {{intellectual}} partisanship, and took pride in defining himself as a politically independent skeptic. Around 1936, he reacted strongly against Julien Benda's rationalist political essays, with their overall critique of intellectual passions, describing them as revived and [...] "excruciatingly boring" [...] versions of positivism, but ignoring their primary, anti-totalitarian, agenda. However, La Conscience malheureuse (with essays on Shestov, Edmund Husserl, Friedrich Nietzsche and Søren Kierkegaard) was noted as Fondane's own contribution to the debate surrounding Popular Front activities {{and the rise of}} fascism: titled after a concept in Hegelian philosophy, which originally referred to the thinking process generating its own divisions, it referred to the possibility of thinkers to interact with the <b>larger</b> <b>world,</b> beyond subjectivity.|$|E
2500|$|Herodotus {{would have}} made his {{researches}} known to the <b>larger</b> <b>world</b> through oral recitations to a public crowd.

These portions of the research seem independent and [...] "almost detachable", so that they might have been set aside by the author for the purposes of an oral performance. The intellectual matrix of the 5thcentury, Marincola suggests, comprised many oral performances in which philosophers would dramatically recite such detachable pieces of their work. The idea was to criticize previous arguments on a topic and emphatically and enthusiastically insert their own in order to win over the audience.|$|E

2500|$|Jinsai's school, {{known as}} the Kogigaku, criticized the teachings of Zhu Xi 朱熹 (1130–1200) and instead {{advocated}} a philosophical vision based on {{an understanding of the}} meanings of key terms in the Analects and the Mencius. [...] His school has been considered part of a larger movement, Kogaku ("ancient learning'), including earlier scholars such as Yamaga Sokō 山鹿素行 (1622–1685), and later thinkers such as Ogyū Sorai 荻生徂徠 (1666–1728). However, Jinsai never mentions Sokō or his ideas, and Jinsai's own statements of philosophical meaning were strongly and systematically criticized by Sorai. Rather than as a thinker aligned with the so-called Kogaku movement, Jinsai's ideas are best understood on their own terms. Jinsai is widely known for his outspoken affirmation of the validity of human emotions, and his articulation of a metaphysics highlighting the pervasiveness and infinite creative potential of a [...] "unitary generative force" [...] (Jpn: ichigenki). Indicative of his renown in the <b>larger</b> <b>world</b> of East Asian philosophy, Jinsai's writings have frequently been compared to those of the Qing dynasty scholar Dai Zhen 戴震 (1724–1777), whose key work, [...] Mengzi ziyi shuzheng (The Meanings of Philosophical Terms in the Mencius) is very similar in theme and method to Jinsai's opus, the Gomō jigi (The Meanings of Philosophical Terms in the Analects and Mencius).|$|E
2500|$|Playing {{can also}} be seen in the use of a {{transitional}} object, Winnicott's term for an object, such as a teddy bear, that has a quality for a small child of being both real and made-up at the same time. Winnicott pointed out that no one demands that a toddler explain whether his Binky is a [...] "real bear" [...] or a creation of the child's own imagination, and went on to argue that it's very important that the child is allowed to experience the Binky as being in an undefined, [...] "transitional" [...] status between the child's imagination and the real world outside the child. For Winnicott, {{one of the most important}} and precarious stages of development was in the first three years of life, when an infant grows into a child with an increasingly separate sense of self in relation to a <b>larger</b> <b>world</b> of other people. In health, the child learns to bring his or her spontaneous, real self into play with others; in a false self disorder, the child has found it unsafe or impossible to do so, and instead feels compelled to hide the true self from other people, and pretend to be whatever they want instead. Playing with a transitional object can be an important early bridge between self and other, which helps a child develop the capacity to be genuine in relationships, and creative.|$|E
