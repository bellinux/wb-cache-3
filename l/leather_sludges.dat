25|$|In addition, fly ash, mainly class C, {{may be used}} in the stabilization/solidification {{process of}} {{hazardous}} wastes and contaminated soils. For example, the Rhenipal process uses fly ash as an admixture to stabilize sewage sludge and other toxic sludges. This process has been used since 1996 to stabilize large amounts of chromium(VI) contaminated <b>leather</b> <b>sludges</b> in Alcanena, Portugal.|$|E

A laboratory experimentation {{has been done}} to investigate changes of thermal properties of sandy soil as influenced by organic waste mixed in the soil and the effect of the changes on soil moisture retention and evaporation. The samples of sandy soil is mixed with selected organic waste (i. e: <b>sludge</b> of <b>leather</b> industry, <b>sludge</b> of tapioca industry and composted green manure). The treated soil are then placed in PVC tubes, saturated with water and placed in greenhouse for measuring changes in soil properties during 50 days. Result of the experimentation shows that the organic waste mixed with sandy soil could significantly change its volumetric heat capacity and thermal regimes. The changes significantly affect the rate and amount of soil moisture loss through evaporation. During 50 days, the treated soil has lost 35 % of their soil moisture content. While the untreated (control) soil has lost 75 % of its soil moisture content...|$|R
40|$|The {{gasification}} {{of biomass}} into useful fuel enhances its {{potential as a}} renewable energy resource. The fixed bed gasification systems are classified as updraft, Imbert downdraft, throatless downdraft, crossdraft and two stage gasifiers. Updraft gasifiers are suitable for gasification of biomass containing high ash (up to 15 %) and high moisture content (up to 50 %) and generate producer gas having high tar content (50 – 100 g/Nm 3). The high temperature (830 oC) air gasification of biomass in updraft gasifiers increase the lower calorific value of producer gas and reduce the tar content. The updraft gasifiers {{have been used for}} gasification of bark, wood blocks, chips and pellets, straw, maize cobs, refuse derived fuel (RDF), and waste pellets with air and O 2 as the gasifying media. The Imbert downdraft gasifiers are suitable to handle biomass fuel having ash and moisture content less than five per cent and 20 % respectively. Modifications in the design of grate and hopper of Imbert downdraft gasifiers have been suggested to gasify non-woody biomass such as coir dust, cotton stalks, wheat straw, hazelnut shells, <b>leather</b> residues, <b>sludge</b> etc. Downdraft gasifiers yield producer gas with lower tar content (1 - 2 g/Nm 3) than updraft gasifiers. Throatless downdraft gasifier...|$|R
40|$|Tannery {{residues}} {{and coal}} mine waste are heavily polluting sources in Brazil, {{mainly in the}} Southern States of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. In order to {{study the effects of}} residues of chrome <b>leather</b> tanning (<b>sludge</b> and <b>leather</b> shavings) and coal waste on soybean and maize crops, a field experiment is in progress since 1996, at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul Experimental Station, county of Eldorado do Sul, Brazil. The residues were applied twice (growing seasons 1996 / 97 and 1999 / 00). The amounts of tannery residues were applied according to their neutralizing value, at rates of up to 86. 8 t ha- 1, supplying from 671 to 1. 342 kg ha- 1 Cr(III); coal waste was applied at a total rate of 164 t ha- 1. Crop yield and dry matter production were evaluated, as well as the nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu and Zn) and Cr contents. Crop yields with tannery sludge application were similar to those obtained with N and lime supplied with mineral amendments. Plant Cr absorption did not increase significantly with the residue application. Tannery sludge can be used also to neutralize the high acidity developed in the soil by coal mine waste...|$|R
40|$|EU {{energy and}} {{environmental}} policy in waste management leads to increasing interest in developing methods for waste disposal with minimum {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} and minimum environmental impacts. From {{the point of view of}} nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions, waste incineration and waste cocombustion is very acceptable method of waste disposal. Two factors are important for attaining very low N 2 O emissions from waste incineration, particularly for waste with higher nitrogen content (e. g. sewage <b>sludge,</b> <b>leather,</b> etc.) : temperature of incineration over 900 ◦C and avoiding selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR) de-NOx method based on urea. For reduction of N 2 O emissions retroﬁtting such plants to ammonia-based SNCR is recommendable. The modern selective catalytic reduction facilities for de-NOx at waste incineration plants are only negligible source of N 2 O. JRC. F. 2 -Cleaner energie...|$|R
