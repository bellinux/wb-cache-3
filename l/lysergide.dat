40|$|In a {{chromosome}} study on leucocyte cultures made in 13 patients treated with chlorpromazine, 15 treated with perphenazine, and nine treated with <b>lysergide,</b> {{a significantly higher}} frequency of gaps, breaks, and hypodiploid cells in the patients treated with perphenazine and <b>lysergide</b> occurred compared with the 41 controls studied. It is concluded that if some drugs can induce major chromosome abnormalities, and less toxic alternatives are available, the latter {{should be used in}} preference...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{renal failure}} is a known sequel to rhabdomyolysis, both {{traumatic}} and non-traumatic. Two {{patients who had}} been placed in straitjackets after taking <b>lysergide</b> (LSD) developed acute renal failure and rhabdomyolysis. One subsequently died. The rhabdomyolysis probably resulted from a combination of severe restraint and the violent movements induced by the drug. The use of straitjackets cannot be considered to be completely safe in such cases...|$|E
40|$|Abuse {{of drugs}} “for kicks” is {{becoming}} more common in Great Britain. This article reviews 252 consecutive cases of drug abuse admitted to the Regional Poisoning Treatment Centre, Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, during 1971 and 1972. Of the 189 patients (146 males and 43 females; mean age 20 years) 72 % of admissions occurred between 6 p. m. and 8 a. m., and Saturday {{was the most common}} day for admissions. The commonest source of referral was via the police or ambulance service. Barbiturates were the drugs most often abused, followed by LSD (<b>lysergide)</b> and Mandrax (methaqualone and diphenhydramine). Sixty-five per cent. of patients had previously abused drugs. Medical care was required in 45 % of the admissions. Sixty per cent. were in social class 4 or 5 and psychiatric and social support was required in only a small minority of patients...|$|E
40|$|The non-nucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitor efavirenz {{is part of}} the WHO guidelines for preferred first-line treatment of HIV- 1 -infected adults, pregnant and lactating women, and children. Efavirenz is well known to cause CNS toxicity. Although good data for CNS toxicity are available for adults, the opposite is true for children. Paediatric studies on this topic frequently suffer from small sample sizes or absence of thorough neuropsychiatric assessments. In this Personal View, we focus on two knowledge gaps of CNS toxicity of efavirenz in children. First, plasma concentrations of efavirenz are difficult to predict in children because of immaturity of and genetic variation in metabolic enzymes. Second, efavirenz exerts a <b>lysergide</b> (LSD) -like effect on brain serotonergic pathways and affects CNS metabolic pathways, including mitochondrial function. Whether these effects interfere with normal brain development is unknown. These uncertainties underline the imminent need for better monitoring of mental health and neurocognitive development in children given and exposed to efavirenz...|$|E
