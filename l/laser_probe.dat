This paper reports on applications of the <b>laser</b> interferometer <b>probe</b> for surface detection of stress waves and the <b>laser</b> transmission <b>probe</b> for sensing of stress waves inside transparent materials. <b>Laser</b> light <b>probes</b> were used to characterize ultrasonic and acoustic emission transducers 2 ̆ 7 response in a realistic configuration, with transducers in actual contact with a solid. <b>Laser</b> light <b>probes</b> also were applied in directly detecting acoustic emission due to stress corrosion cracking in 7039 aluminum and crazing of Plexiglass. The results of the <b>laser</b> light <b>probe</b> measurements indicate that conventional piezoelectric transducers, although adequate for many ultrasonic pulse inspection tests, are severely limited as stress pulse sensors for acoustic emission measurements. The acoustic emission signals measured by the <b>laser</b> light <b>probe</b> showed a pulse-like waveform {{which has not been}} previously recorded by conventional piezoelectric acoustic emission sensors...|$|R

Fringe projection systems, theodolite triangulation systems or laser distant and triangulation systems are not called measuring machines, but the measuring result is the same: a space point. <b>Laser</b> <b>probes</b> are used to detect {{the distance between the}} surface and the reference point {{on the end of the}} kinematic chain (i.e.: end of the Z-drive component).

5000|$|Spectroscopic photo-reflectance {{employs a}} broad band probe light source, which may cover {{wavelengths}} from the infrared to the ultraviolet. By fitting spectroscopic photo-reflectance data with the conventional third derivative functional form, a comprehensive set of interband transition energies, amplitudes, and widths may be obtained, providing an essentially complete {{characterization of the}} electronic properties of the sample of interest. However, owing {{to the need to}} keep the probe light intensity to a minimum and to the practical necessity of phase-locked detection, spectroscopic photo-reflectance measurements must be made sequentially, i.e. probe one wavelength at a time. This constraint limits the speed of spectroscopic photo-reflectance measurements, and coupled with the need for a careful fit procedure, renders spectroscopic photo-reflectance more suitable for analytical applications. Conversely, laser photo-reflectance employs a monochromatic light source, and hence is well suited for industrial applications. Moreover, in commonly encountered situations, the coherent wavefront of <b>laser</b> <b>probe</b> beam may be used to isolate the refractive component of the photo-reflectance signal, greatly simplifying the data analysis.|$|E
5000|$|Stand-off remote Raman. In {{standoff}} Raman, {{the sample}} is measured {{at a distance from}} the Raman spectrometer, usually by using a telescope for light collection. Remote Raman spectroscopy was proposed in the 1960s and initially developed for the measurement of atmospheric gases. The technique was extended In 1992 by Angel et al. for standoff Raman detection of hazardous inorganic and organic compounds. Standoff Raman detection offers a fast-Raman mode of analyzing large areas such as a football field in minutes. A pulsed laser source and gated detector allow Raman spectra measurements in the daylight and reduces the long-lived fluorescent background generated by transition ions and rare earth ions. Another way to avoid fluorescence, first demonstrated by Sandy Asher in 1984, is to use a UV <b>laser</b> <b>probe</b> beam. At wavelengths of 260 nm, there is effectively no fluorescence interference and the UV signal is inherently strong. A 10X beam expander mounted in front of the laser allows focusing of the beam and a telescope is directly coupled through the camera lens for signal collection. With the system's time-gating capability it is possible to measure remote Raman of your distant target and the atmosphere between the laser and target.|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, where spectroscopic {{information}} is not required, photo-reflectance techniques have been implemented in semiconductor manufacturing process control. For example, in the late 1980s, Therma-Wave, Inc. introduced the [...] "Therma-Probe" [...] photo-modulated reflectance system to the market for semiconductor process control equipment. The original Therma-Probe focused an intensity modulated pump laser beam onto a spot on a silicon sample, modulating the sample reflectance. The reflectance changes were detected by a coincident <b>laser</b> <b>probe</b> beam of 633 nanometer wavelength. At this wavelength no electro-reflectance signal is present, since it is far removed from any interband transitions in silicon. Rather, the mechanisms responsible for the Therma-Probe signal are thermo-modulation and the Drude free carrier effect. The Therma-Probe was used primarily for monitoring of the ion implantation process in silicon semiconductor manufacturing. Measurement systems such as the Therma-Probe are particularly desirable in process control of microelectronics manufacturing because they provide the ability to quickly verify the correct execution of process steps, without contacting the wafer or removing the wafer from the clean room. Generally a number of measurements will be made on {{certain areas of the}} wafer and compared with expected values. As long as the measured values are within a certain range, the wafers are passed for continued processing. (This is known as statistical process control.) Other photo-modulated reflectance systems marketed for process control of implant processes are the [...] "TWIN" [...] metrology system marketed by PVA TePla AG, and the [...] "PMR-3000" [...] marketed by Semilab Co. Ltd (originally Boxer-Cross, Inc.).|$|E
40|$|AbstractReverse {{engineering}} {{technology has been}} widely recognized as a crucial strategy for innovative design of products. However, currently one of major problems for its application is that huge amounts of digitized points cloud data need to be processed for geometrical surface modelling, especially for unknown free-form surfaces which are widely used in industry fields such as aircraft, automobile, shipbuilding, steam turbine, etc. In order to digitize unknown free-form surfaces accurately and efficiently, an adaptive sampling approach based on advanced path detecting has been presented. The method is characterized by integrating one touch- trigger <b>probe</b> and two <b>laser</b> <b>probes</b> onto the same Z axis of Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM), and the two <b>laser</b> <b>probes</b> are located {{on both sides of}} the touch probe. During sampling, the CMM scans the free-form surface line by line. At the scanning direction, the <b>laser</b> <b>probes</b> are applied to collect the measuring path information in front of the touch probe. And the data acquired by the <b>laser</b> <b>probes</b> is processed and fitted into B-spline curves real-timely, and then the curvature feature of the measuring path is extracted. The obtained path information is used to generate a new measuring path for touch probe to achieve adaptive sampling. While at the cross-section feeding direction, curvature analysis algorithm based on the angle variation between measuring sections is employed to subdivide the cross-sections when needed. Repeating this procedure, the measuring sections will be distributed adaptively. Simulation and experiment results indicate that the sampling points generated by the touch probe are laid out rationally according to the curvature of the surfaces, therefore the sampling efficiency and accuracy can be improved significantly by the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|A {{randomized}} {{clinical trial}} {{was performed to}} test the hypothesis that a laser-heated probe is superior to standard techniques to reopen occluded femoral arteries. Twenty patients were treated with a standard guidewire and balloon dilation method. In a second group of 20 patients, the <b>laser</b> <b>probe</b> was initially used as a nonheated mechanical device. If the probe was unsuccessful in mechanically reopening the artery, an Argon laser was activated to heat the probe. The mean length of occlusion was 15. 9 ± 10. 3 cm. The success rate for the <b>laser</b> <b>probe</b> was 15 of 20 (75 %), which was not significantly different from the standard method, 19 of 20 (95 %). Most of the success in the laser-probe group was due to the probe's mechanical properties. The <b>laser</b> <b>probe</b> was successful as a cold, mechanical device in 13 of 15 (87 %) arteries. It was necessary to heat the probe in 5 patients. When heated, the <b>laser</b> <b>probe</b> assisted recanalization in 2 but perforated the artery in 3 cases. The results of this randomized trial do not support the hypotheses behind the use of the thermal <b>laser</b> <b>probe.</b> The <b>laser</b> <b>probe</b> functions primarily as a mechanical device. The thermal activation does not significantly improve the success rate without increasing the risk of perforation. This small additional benefit does not justify the large cost of current thermal laser devices. This controlled study also demonstrates a higher success rate in long occlusions than previous reports of mechanical balloon recanalization. This is due to a combination approach of retrograde and anterograde probing of the occluded segment. © 1991...|$|E

Material and methods: On each of 50 extracted teeth, a calculus-positive and calculus-free root surface was evaluated by two independent examiners with a low-power indium gallium arsenide phosphide diode laser (DIAGNOdent) fitted with a periodontal probe-like sapphire tip and emitting visible red light at 655  nm wavelength. Laser autofluorescence intensity readings of examined root surfaces were scored on a 0 – 99 scale, with duplicate assessments performed using the <b>laser</b> <b>probe</b> tip directed both perpendicular and parallel to evaluated tooth root surfaces. Pearson correlation coefficients of untransformed measurements, and kappa analysis of data dichotomized with a > 40 autofluorescence intensity threshold, were calculated to assess intra- and inter-examiner reproducibility of the laser device. Mean autofluorescence intensity scores of calculus-positive and calculus-free root surfaces were evaluated with the Student’s t-test. Results: Excellent intra- and inter-examiner reproducibility was found for DIAGNOdent laser autofluorescence intensity measurements, with Pearson correlation coefficients above 94 %, and kappa values ranging between 0. 96 and 1. 0, for duplicate readings taken with both <b>laser</b> <b>probe</b> tip orientations. Significantly higher autofluorescence intensity values were measured when the <b>laser</b> <b>probe</b> tip was directed perpendicular, rather than parallel, to tooth root surfaces. However, calculus-positive roots, particularly with calculus in markedly-raised ledges, yielded significantly greater mean DIAGNOdent laser autofluorescence intensity scores than calculus-free surfaces, regardless of probe tip orientation. DIAGNOdent autofluorescence intensity values > 40 exhibited a stronger association with calculus (36. 6 odds ratio) then measurements of ≥ 5 (20. 1 odds ratio) when the <b>laser</b> <b>probe</b> tip was advanced parallel to root surfaces.
