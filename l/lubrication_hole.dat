50|$|One of {{the common}} early {{problems}} was with the clutch basket which was eventually replaced under warranty. The intermediate gear was strengthened and concentricity improved. However, the problem then moved to the next weakest part, the alternator drive shaft/Z25 gear, which, in extreme cases could break at a <b>lubrication</b> <b>hole.</b> It commonly manifested itself in the 1130 variant of the engine, as a difficulty {{to crank the engine}} when hot. The root cause of the clutch / alternator drive problem was thermal expansion, which reduced the Z25 / intermediate gear clearances to negative. The solution was to improve the concentricity of both the clutch intermediate and alternator drive shaft gears, and increase their clearance. At the same time, the alternator drive hub fastening method was changed from a lock washer to a belleville washer to stop the bolt from working loose due to heat cycling.|$|E
2500|$|Inkosi: Production 2015–present. [...] Known as the [...] "Chief" [...] in Zulu, the Inkosi {{features}} a large hollow grind, twin over sized washers, a strengthened pivot and sturdy lock up. While challenging {{the standards of}} the Integral Lock®, the Inkosi uses a ceramic ball as an interface for the lock bar to the blade tang for a consistent lock-up. The washer diameter is wider than the blade securing zero sideways play. With larger <b>lubrication</b> <b>holes</b> there is even less surface area of friction. Finally, the large hollow grind provides a shallow radius, for improved strength, making it half way between a flat grind and our standard hollow grind.|$|R

The metallurgical structure {{as well as the}} chemical composition of steels widely influence their ability to be machined. Mittal Steel Europe R & D develops new steel grades such as the Super High Strength Steels whose tensile stresses may reach 1000 or 1200 MPa. A cooperative research program between Mittal Steel Europe R&D and ENSAM tends to propose a methodology able to sort the steel grades in terms of ability to be manufactured (in forging and machining). This study focuses on such an industrial application : the heavy vehicles crankshaft manufacturing. The operation investigated consists in deep hole drilling and is concerned with the <b>lubrication</b> <b>holes.</b> This paper proposes some relevant criteria to compare the different steel grades and/or structures.

40|$|In this {{research}} the affect that <b>lubrication</b> at a <b>hole</b> and pin connection {{has on the}} fatigue life of a double shear lap joint is studied both experimentally and numerically. The study focuses on the joint middle plate item, which is connected via a central hole to the outer plates {{by means of a}} clearance fitting pin, thereby placing the hole in double shear. In the experimental work three identical batches of fatigue specimens, which are made from aluminum alloy 2024 -T 3, were fatigue tested. In the first batch the surface of the fastener hole was not lubricated whilst the hole in the other two batches was lubricated - each batch using a different lubricant. The three batches of double shear lap joint specimens were fatigue tested and their S-N curves established. The results show that the specimens in which the holes were lubricated have better fatigue lives than the non-lubricated hole specimens. In the numerical study, FE simulations were performed to include <b>hole</b> <b>lubrication</b> effect on the stress distribution by using different friction coefficient at the interface of the hole and its fastener (pin). The FE results have helped to gain an understanding of the reasons for fatigue life improvement and also have helped to quantify the level of improvement...|$|R

It is the key problem to be solved that how to supply the oil to friction surface in space liquid lubrication system. It analyzed the lubricating manner. A space liquid lubrication system was designed based on a principle of using deformation energy to supply oil. In the analysis of its basic structure and operating principle, the film calculation mode was established based on the elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory. The lubricating performance was simulated by ANSYS finite element analysis software in microgravity. The calculation results show that: in the microgravity, it could achieve elastohydrodynamic lubrication on friction surface in this lubrication system. When the oil supply hole diameter is 2 mm, the film-thickness ratio changes between 1. 91 and 4. 28. It belongs to elastohydrodynamic <b>lubrication.</b> The <b>hole</b> diameter decreases, the film thickness reduces. The minimum film-thickness ratio is 0. 93 when the temperature changes widely from- 50 ℃ ~+ 80 ℃. It belongs to boundary lubrication state...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{studying}} the structure and design specification of Flender’s gear units, a method of parametric design and modeling for batch gear units based on Pro/Engineer has been adopted. According to given dimensions, we has initially defined variables in Pro/Engineer and established a family table which comprises all the required dimensions, then assigned variables or equations to corresponding feature dimensions during modeling. The model of a gear unit consists of two sections: one is the fundamental shape, the dimensions of which are all given; {{the other is the}} external embellish, including the bosses around the axes, the oil gallery for <b>lubrication,</b> the inspecting <b>hole</b> and so on, the dimensions of which are to be designed and determined by designers so as to create an ideal figure of the case. Thus, each series of gear units merely requires a single model, so that all parts in the entire series of gear units shall be generated through the family table and saved as an individual product respectively.

5000|$|Rotary {{bearings}} hold {{rotating components}} such as shafts or axles within mechanical systems, and transfer axial and radial loads {{from the source}} of the load to the structure supporting it. The simplest form of bearing, the plain bearing, consists of a shaft rotating in a <b>hole.</b> <b>Lubrication</b> is often used to reduce friction. In the ball bearing and roller bearing, to prevent sliding friction, rolling elements such as rollers or balls with a circular cross-section are located between the races or journals of the bearing assembly. A wide variety of bearing designs exists to allow the demands of the application to be correctly met for maximum efficiency, reliability, durability and performance. The term [...] "bearing" [...] is derived from the verb [...] ""; a bearing being a machine element that allows one part to bear (i.e., to support) another. The simplest bearings are bearing surfaces, cut or formed into a part, with varying degrees of control over the form, size, roughness and location of the surface. Other bearings are separate devices installed into a machine or machine part. The most sophisticated bearings for the most demanding applications are very precise devices; their manufacture requires some of the highest standards of current technology.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the main design parameters contributing to loosening of bolts due to vibration and to identify their relative importance and degree of contribution to bolt loosening. Vibration testing was conducted on a shaketable with a controlled-random input in the dynamic testing laboratory of the Structural Test Division of MSFC. Test specimens which contained one test bolt were vibrated for a fixed amount of time and percentage of pre-load loss was measured. Each specimen tested implemented some combination of eleven design parameters as dictated by the design of experiment methodology employed. The eleven design parameters were: bolt size (diameter), <b>lubrication</b> on bolt, <b>hole</b> tolerance, initial pre-load, nut locking device, grip length, thread pitch, lubrication between mating materials, class of fit, joint configuration and mass of configuration. These parameters were chosen for this experiment because they are believed to be the design parameters having the greatest impact on bolt loosening. Two values of each design parameter were used and each combination of parameters tested was subjected to two different directions of vibration and two different g-levels of vibration. One replication was made for each test to gain some indication of experimental error and repeatability and to give some degree of statistical credibility to the data, resulting in a total of 96 tests being performed. The results of the investigation indicated that nut locking devices, joint configuration, fastener size, and mass of configuration were significant in bolt loosening due to vibration. The results of this test can be utilized to further research the complex problem of bolt loosening due to vibration...|$|R

40|$|Aircraft {{are often}} {{designed}} with numbers determined by testing in a lab, {{rather than by}} repeatedly building prototypes. These lab tests conform to testing specifications so that the numbers can be compared between manufacturers, suppliers, and lab technicians. One such specification is ASTM specification E 238 – 84 (08), and {{it is used to}} determine important properties of a bearing pin joint like hinges, bolt holes, and rivet joints. The properties determined from this fastener-through-plate method are bearing strength, bearing yield strength, and bearing stiffness. Adhering to the methods outlined in ASTM E 238, a study was performed, looking at the effects that plate material, fastener used, fastener <b>lubrication,</b> and plate <b>hole</b> preparation method (whether drilled and reamed or just drilled) have on the three bearing joint properties. The plate materials used were Al 7050 – T 7451, Ti – 6 Al – 4 V (mill annealed), and PH 13 – 8 Mo – H 1000. The fasteners were Ti – 6 Al – 4 V screws, coated A 286 screws, and high speed steel (HSS) pins used as a control. Lubrication was tested using a corrosion inhibitor, PR – 1776 M B – 2 from PRC – DeSoto, on the fastener or leaving the fastener uncoated. The HSS pins were always tested in the uncoated condition. 54 runs were performed, as outlined by a D-optimal design of experiment. It was discovered from the statistical analysis of the results via ANOVA that both the plate material used and the pin material, whether a screw or a pin, had a significant effect on the bearing strength, bearing yield strength, and bearing stiffness. The interaction between the two factors was also significant on all responses but the bearing stiffness. PH 13 – 8 Mo – H 1000 plates seemed to perform best on average, followed by Ti – 6 Al – 4 V plates, then Al 7050 – T 7451 plates. PH 13 – 8 Mo – H 1000 and Ti – 6 Al – 4 V plates had similar bearing strength and bearing yield strength averages with the HSS control pins being used, which had the highest mean values for a given plate and fastener. The Ti – 6 Al – 4 V and A 286 screws behaved and performed statistically similar in most cases, except when hole preparation method was take into account. The Ti – 6 Al – 4 V screws performed better when the hole was drilled and reamed, while the coated A 286 screws performed better when the hole was drilled only. All screws had lower resulting bearing properties than the HSS control pins. It was also found that ASTM specification E 238 – 84 (08) is a precise test method, since the method could be performed repeatably and reliably with no missing data points. Therefore, this ASTM testing method is reasonable for determining bearing properties, which can then be used to design aircraft...|$|R
