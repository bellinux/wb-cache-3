30|$|In Japan, {{the pattern}} of {{responses}} about use of practices that support conceptual understanding was {{at odds with the}} findings from previous TIMSS administrations. For example in TIMSS 1999, Japan <b>led</b> <b>the</b> other <b>nations</b> <b>in</b> teaching for conceptual understanding in eighth grade mathematics classrooms, ranking first in the frequency of using such practices (Mullis et al., 2000). Moreover, the TIMSS video study, also conducted in 1999, came to the same conclusion based on classroom observations (Hiebert et al., 2005). However, the patterns observed here for TIMSS 2007 suggest there may have been changes in Japanese teachers’ practices in the intervening years; teachers in Japan no longer reported using the six strategies as frequently as in previous TIMSS administrations. Overall, teachers in Korea, and in some cases the U.S., employed these strategies more frequently than teachers in Japan.|$|R

NCAA.org requires a minimum of 2.5 made per game, and Stauskas had been the leader since the December 9 weekly report.
