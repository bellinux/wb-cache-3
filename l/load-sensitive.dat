50|$|While {{commercial}} trainers on mini-computer systems had {{a longer}} history, {{the first two}} mass-market English 'computer game' railway simulators, MSTS and Trainz, arrived {{within a few months}} of one another in 2001 and could run (poorly) on Intel 80386 microprocessor based systems. Some, like the first wide-market release, Microsoft Train Simulator (MSTS), are written and modeled for the user mainly interested in driving. Others, like MSTS's principle rival, Trainz, were aimed initially primarily at the rail enthusiast-hobbyist markets, supporting features making it possible to build a virtual railroad of one's dreams. Accordingly, for four years Trainz releases bundled a free copy of gmax digital model building software on each CDROM, hosted an asset swap website (Trainz Exchange, later the Trainz Download Station), encouraged user participation and dialog with an active forum, and took pains to publish in-depth how-to model guidelines and specifications with its releases. Several other later challengers as well as Trainz (with a series of upgrades) soon matched or eclipsed MSTS's driving experiences one way or another. Railsim, actually a successor using the MSTS game engine upped the challenge to the aging MSTS by adding much improved graphics, so Trainz did as well, but also added interactive industries and dynamic driving features such as product loading and unloading, <b>load-sensitive</b> physics modeling affecting driving and operating and user interface changes to improve User eXperiences (UX), such as a free camera mode allowing roaming away from the train cars, free and clear of the Train being operated-while still controlling it. This latter makes particular sense given the dearth of an assistant on a walkie-talky while operating a train during coupling operations or other position sensitive tasks such as loading and unloading. Railsim and a couple of others came and went out of business, and Railsim was reorganized as Rail Simulator with the software company that wrote MSTS as its core, while MSTS aged and never did get upgraded as Microsoft had once begun and announced. In the last few years, Rail Simulator has changed its name to Train Simulator 2016. As the world market has shaken out, Australian Trainz in 2014-2015 upgraded itself with Trainz: A New Era, still servicing the wider route builder and driving markets, but now matching the 64bit computing and graphics of Train Simulator 2013, 2015, and Train Simulator 2016. In the same five-year period, Train simulators have moved to pad computer and phone platforms.|$|E

This paper presents a contention resolution scheme in wavelength and space dimension. By integrating deflection routing with wavelength conversion, this paper investigates their effects on packet-loss performance through simulation studies. In particular, we propose a <b>load-sensitive</b> deflection algorithm to compute the preferred and deflection routing tables. The proposed algorithm proves effective in resolving contention and in reducing packet-loss rate. The <b>load-sensitive</b> deflection routing can share network resources between multiple nodes effectively and produce the same effect as {{increasing the number of}} wavelengths in each node.

The ability of dynamic routing to circumvent congested links and improve application performance makes it a valuable traffic engineering tool. However, deployment of <b>load-sensitive</b> routing is hampered by the overheads imposed by link-state update propagation, path selection, and signaling. Under reasonable protocol and computational overheads, traditional approaches to <b>load-sensitive</b> routing of IP traffic are ineffective, and can introduce significant route flapping, since paths are selected based on out-of-date link-state information. Although stability is improved by performing <b>load-sensitive</b> routing at the flow level, flapping still occurs, because most IP flows have a short duration relative to the desired frequency of link-state updates.

40|$|In many {{real-world}} scenarios, we {{must make}} judgments {{in the presence of}} computational constraints. One common computational constraint arises when the features used to make a judgment each have differing acquisition costs, but there is a fixed total budget for a set of judgments. Particularly when there are a large number of classifications that must be made in a real-time, an intelligent strategy for optimizing accuracy versus computational costs is essential. E-mail classification is an area where accurate and timely results require such a trade-off. We identify two scenarios where intelligent feature acquisition can improve classifier performance. In granular classification we seek to classify e-mails with increasingly specific labels structured in a hierarchy, where each level of the hierarchy requires a different trade-off between cost and accuracy. In <b>load-sensitive</b> classification, we classify a set of instances within an arbitrary total budget for acquiring features. Our method, Adaptive Classifier Cascades (ACC), designs a policy to combine a series of base classifiers with increasing computational costs given a desired trade-off between cost and accuracy. Using this method, we learn a relationship between feature costs and label hierarchies, for granular classification and cost budgets, for <b>load-sensitive</b> classification. We evaluate our method on real-world e-mail datasets with realistic estimates of feature acquisition cost, and we demonstrate superior results when compared to baseline classifiers that do not have a granular, cost-sensitive feature acquisition policy. 1...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the contribution of proprioceptive feedback to the amplitude modulation of the soleus muscle activity during human walking. We have previously shown that slow-velocity, small-amplitude ankle dorsiflexion enhancements and reductions applied during the stance phase of the step cycle generate, respectively, increments and decrements on the ongoing soleus activity. We have also shown that the increments in soleus activity are at least partially mediated by feedback from group Ia fibres. In the present study, we further investigated the afferent-mediated contribution from muscle group II afferents, cutaneous and proprioceptive afferents from the foot, and <b>load-sensitive</b> afferents to the soleus EMG. Slow-velocity, small-amplitude ankle trajectory modifications were combined with the pharmaceutical depression of group II polysynaptic pathways with tizanidine hydrochloride, anaesthetic blocking of sensory information from the foot with injections of lidocaine hydrochloride, and modulation of load feedback by increasing and decreasing the body load. The depression of the group II afferents significantly reduced the soleus response to the ankle trajectory modifications. Blocking sensory feedback from the foot did not have an effect on the soleus muscle activity. Changes in body load affected the ongoing soleus activity level; however, it did not affect the amplitude of the soleus EMG responses to the ankle trajectory modifications. These results suggest that the feedback from group II afferents, and possibly from <b>load-sensitive</b> afferents, contribute to the amplitude modulation of the soleus muscle activity during the stance phase of the step cycle. However, feedback from cutaneous afferents and instrinsic proprioceptive afferents from the foot does not seem to contribute to this muscle activation...|$|E

In this context, the magnetoelastic {{effect can be}} used in order to measure mechanical loads during the component's service by means of a harmonic analysis of eddy current signals. The utilization of magnetic magnesium as a <b>load-sensitive</b> material in order to measure mechanical loads in structural components has been demonstrated in previous works. Another application is the magnetic labeling of the alloy. In this context the magnetic remanence is a significant characteristic value. A data track can be written directly on the material's surface by means of an electromagnetic write head. The track may contain relevant component-specific information like serial numbers, manufacture date and expected lifetime. This information can be read out by means of a sensor utilizing the giant magnetoresistive (GMR) effect. The magnetic labeling in relation to the manufactured alloy and the cooling rate during the casting process is examined in this work. The magnetic labeling of three alloys based on magnesium, cobalt and zinc has been investigated; these are MgCo 4 and MgCo 4 Zn 2. The alloys’ mechanical as well as their magnetic properties are significantly influenced by these additional alloying elements. In order to investigate the alloys’ suitability for magnetic data storage the quality of the data tracks read out using a GMR sensor are compared depending on the alloy composition.

Centralized network management seriously limits the scalability of network management. The shortcomings of the centralized approach show up during the periods of heavy congestion when management intervention is particularly important. Therefore, in order to cope with problems (such as passive, static, rigid, etc.) arising from centralization, the network management functionality must be decentralized and should become more active and flexible.

40|$|In an open {{shortest}} path first (OSPF) based best effort network, when a packet experiences congestion, the routing subsystem cannot send it through an alternate path. Thus, {{it fails to}} provide desired quality of service (QoS) during congestion. In order to provide QoS we have reported three different load sensitive routing (LSR) protocols in [A. Sahoo, An OSPF based <b>load-sensitive</b> QoS routing algorithm using alternate paths, in: IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication Networks, October 2002; A. Tiwari, A. Sahoo, Providing QoS support in OSPF based best effort network, in: IEEE International Conference on Networks, November 2005; A. Tiwari, A. Sahoo, A local coefficient based load sensitive routing protocol for providing QoS, in: IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems, July 2006]. The LSR protocol forwards packets through alternate paths in case of congestion. The number of alternate paths at any node depends on the value of operating parameter or coefficient used for alternate path calculation. Though the basic protocol in these cases was the same, the methods of choosing operating parameter were different. We referred to these three methods as LSR [A. Sahoo, An OSPF based <b>load-sensitive</b> QoS routing algorithm using alternate paths, in: IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication Networks, October 2002], E-LSR [A. Tiwari, A. Sahoo, Providing QoS support in OSPF based best effort network, in: IEEE International Conference on Networks, November 2005] and L-LSR [A. Tiwari, A. Sahoo, A local coefficient based load sensitive routing protocol for providing QoS, in: IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems, July 2006] coefficient methods. In this paper, we present the LSR protocol along with the three coefficient calculation methods pointing out the reason for going from one method to the next. The main strength of our LSR protocol is that it provides loop free alternate paths in the event of congestion and can interwork with routers running vanilla OSPF protocol. We show through simulation that the LSR protocol based on any of the three different coefficient calculation methods performs much better than OSPF and that out of the three methods proposed by us, L-LSR performs the best.

This was compared to trials where subjects were required to continue attending to all items for the subsequent test. Data show reduction of <b>load-sensitive</b> maintenance-related activity along the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS), directly linked to attentional orienting. While activity in the anterior IPS reflected the number of representations in the focus of attention, the activation pattern in the posterior IPS suggested residual activation related to unattended items. This dissociation is in line with a functional subdivision of the right IPS according to attentional and mnemonic properties...|$|E
40|$|The next 30 years {{could see}} {{dramatic}} changes in domestic energy use, with increasingly stringent building regulations, the uptake of building-integrated microgeneration, the possible electrification of heating (e. g. heat pumps) {{and the use of}} electric vehicles (EV). In this paper, the ESP-r building simulation tool was used to model the consequences of both the electrification of heat and EV charging on the electrical demand characteristics of a future, net-zero-energy dwelling. The paper describes the adaptation of ESP-r so that domestic electrical power flows could be simulated at a temporal resolution high enough to calculate realistic peak demand. An algorithm for EV charging is also presented, along with the different charging options. Strategies by which EV charging and electrified heating could be controlled in order to minimise peak household electrical demand were assessed. The simulation results indicate that uncontrolled vehicle charging and the use of electrified heating could more than double peak household power demand. By contrast, a more intelligent, <b>load-sensitive</b> heating and charging strategy could limit the peak demand rise to around 40 % of a base case with no vehicle or electrified heating. However, overall household electrical energy use was still more than doubled...|$|E
40|$|We {{hypothesised}} that <b>load-sensitive</b> {{expression of}} costameric proteins, which hold the sarcomere {{in place and}} position the mitochondria, contributes to the early adaptations of antigravity muscle to unloading and would depend on muscle fibre composition and chymotrypsin activity of the proteasome. Biopsies were obtained from vastus lateralis (VL) and soleus (SOL) muscles of eight men before and after 3 days of unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) and subjected to fibre typing and measures for costameric (FAK and FRNK), mitochondrial (NDUFA 9, SDHA, UQCRC 1, UCP 3, and ATP 5 A 1), and MHCI protein and RNA content. Mean cross-sectional area (MCSA) of types I and II muscle fibres in VL and type I fibres in SOL demonstrated a trend for a reduction after ULLS (0. 05 <= P < 0. 10). FAK phosphorylation at tyrosine 397 showed a 20 % reduction in VL muscle (P = 0. 029). SOL muscle demonstrated a specific reduction in UCP 3 content (- 23 %; P = 0. 012). Muscle-specific effects of ULLS were identified for linear relationships between measured proteins, chymotrypsin activity and fibre MCSA. The molecular modifications in costamere turnover and energy homoeostasis identify that aspects of atrophy and fibre transformation are detectable at the protein level in weight-bearing muscles within 3 days of unloading...|$|E
