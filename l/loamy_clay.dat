5|$|B.epica {{is fairly}} new to cultivation. Kevin Collins of the Banksia Farm in Albany, Western Australia {{is said to}} have pioneered its cultivation, growing it in <b>loamy</b> <b>clay</b> or sandy gravel. It showed good {{tolerance}} for alkaline soils in those conditions, and has also succeeded in sandy, alkaline soil near the coast between Mandurah and Kwinana. The Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra has also had some success in cultivating the species. Seeds were sown in February 1996, and planted out in November 1997; seedlings planted into sections without good drainage died, but two seedlings that were planted into a section with excellent drainage were about a metre tall by 2002, and flowering prolifically.|$|E
60|$|Al-Madinah dates {{its origin}} doubtless from ancient times, {{and the cause}} of its {{prosperity}} is evident in the abundant supply of water, a necessary generally scarce in Arabia. The formation of the plateau is in some places salt sand, but usually a white chalk, and a <b>loamy</b> <b>clay,</b> which even by the roughest manipulation makes tolerable bricks. Lime also abounds. The town is situated upon a gently-shelving part of the plain, the, lowest portion of which, to judge from the versant, is at the southern base of Mount Ohod, hence called Al-Safilah, and the highest at the Awali, or plains about Kuba, and the East.|$|E
60|$|But he was {{a silent}} {{spectacle}} to her now. Soon he rose out of the valley, and skirted a high plateau of the chalk formation on his right, which rested abruptly upon the fruity district of <b>loamy</b> <b>clay,</b> the character and herbage of the two formations being so distinct that the calcareous upland appeared but as a deposit of a few years' antiquity upon the level vale. He kept {{along the edge of}} this high, unenclosed country, and the sky behind him being deep violet, she could still see white Darling in relief upon it--a mere speck now--a Wouvermans eccentricity reduced to microscopic dimensions. Upon this high ground he gradually disappeared.|$|E

50|$|Although Phagwara tehsil {{includes}} the Dhak area, {{the type of}} soil has traditionally been midway between clay loan or <b>loamy</b> <b>clay</b> and therefore the traditional main crop rotations were maize-wheat, paddy-wheat, sugarcane-wheat, and fodder-wheat, cotton-wheat. However, the current crop rotations in Punjab as a whole have altered {{to keep up with}} changes in ground conditions.|$|E
