500|$|... "It's All Too Much" [...] was remixed for {{inclusion}} on the Yellow Submarine album on 16 October 1968. The vocals and handclaps were processed using automatic double tracking, so allowing these parts to be split across the stereo image. For this version, {{the song was}} edited down from the original eight minutes to a running time of 6:28, making it the longest officially released Beatles track written by Harrison. The edit was achieved by cutting a 35-second portion from around the three-minute mark, thereby removing the third chorus and the fourth verse (the last of which, beginning with the line [...] "Time for me to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> {{you to look at}} me", had appeared in the film), and by fading out before the final minute of the coda.|$|E
2500|$|Gentlemen, I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I {{think of}} the words of Stephen Spender's poem. You are men who in your [...] "lives fought for life... and left the vivid air signed with your honor." ...|$|E

Macumazahn, he is <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> whispering. To whom is he whispering? I see! to Mameena, who also <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> smiles. They are talking. Be silent. I must listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And here I am. Cheer up, George! Whatever is the matter? I've {{been sitting}} in my room <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have been simply prowling. What has gone wrong?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly! <b>And</b> so <b>you</b> {{came along}} to me. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> see, I don't turn my back, <b>and</b> I am <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> {{thinking}} about <b>you</b> {{from top to}} toe." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Ha, ha,' {{cried the}} secretary, laying his hand, with growing familiarity, upon the chairman's arm. 'When I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> {{think of your}} {{property}} in Bengal being--ha, ha, ha!--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You unbend your {{forehead}} at last," [...] said Mr. Rivers. [...] "I thought Medusa had <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> that <b>you</b> were turning to stone. Perhaps now you will ask {{how much you}} are worth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{hour for}} bad dreams, truly, husband; yet dreams do not weigh {{the hour of}} their coming. I dreamed this: that I lay dead beside <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> thou knewest it not, while Swanhild <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> mocked." ...|$|R
6000|$|And thou, to lull thine infant rest, [...] Wast cradled like an Indian child; All {{pleasant}} winds {{from south}} and west [...] With lullabies thine ears beguiled, Rocking thee in thine oriole's nest, [...] Till Nature <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> smiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose they've {{no reason}} you'd take. Once I heard Nels say he'd seen the Greaser <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> {{if he ever}} saw him do it again he'd shoot him." ...|$|E
60|$|How could I help seeing? I was a woman. Only, {{with your}} voice you never spoke a word. Sit down, there, where I may <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> {{let me tell}} you. I shall do the {{speaking}} now.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, wolf," [...] said he, [...] "afore I {{kill you}} {{like any other}} beast,--which is wot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,--I'll have a good <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> a good goad at you. O you enemy!" ...|$|E
5000|$|After the {{invasion}} of Iraq, when {{no weapons of mass}} destruction were found, Kerry strongly criticized Bush, contending that he had misled the country: [...] "When the President of the United States <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> tells <b>you</b> something, there should be some trust." ...|$|R
60|$|Never take a sheet-bath-- never. Next {{to meeting}} a lady {{acquaintance}} who, for reasons best known to herself, don't see <b>you</b> when she <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> don't know <b>you</b> {{when she does}} see you, {{it is the most}} uncomfortable thing in the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "That sounds crazy, doesn't it?" [...] she asked, [...] "but it isn't. It is {{an honest}} {{expression}} of a very natural wish. Hundreds of ladies have doubtless <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> had that wish; but social conventions forbade their expressing it. Here we have no conventions, and I speak my mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '--Being,' resumed David, 'being amenable--your {{property}} in Bengal being amenable--to all claims upon the company; when I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> think of that, you might tickle me into fits by waving the feather of a pen at me. Upon my soul you might!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can do it, and I will! If I get tired, I'll <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> mother,--always so {{faithful}} {{to what you}} undertake,--and remember my motto," [...] cried Abby, anxious to follow the example set her in the daily life of these good parents.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{so glad to}} see you," [...] {{she said}} a little breathlessly, flinging her muff and boa on a chair. [...] "Sit there, where I can <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> tell me why you didn't let me know you were coming to New York." ...|$|E
60|$|The Bon Ton Store--big as four barns--my! {{it would}} simply scare {{a person to}} go in there, with seven or eight clerks all <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> the men's suits, on figures just like human. And Axel Egge's, like home, lots of Swedes and Norskes in there, and a card of dandy buttons, like rubies.|$|R
6000|$|... "When Arnold {{brought you}} to Bourne End," [...] Fenella continued, [...] "for one moment I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I wondered. <b>You</b> seemed, even then, {{to remind me of}} some one who had existed in the past.

Yet must I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> feel myself puzzled. You are not an artist--no? You do not paint or write?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing in particular," [...] and Hetty glanced reflectively at the fire. [...] "Still, I don't {{think you}} would be content with any girl likely to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> {{most of us would}} like to have a good deal more than we ever get." ...|$|E

Then you must have your sword ready, and take off {{the head of the}} man who sits on him, as he turns <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> there is no sword in the world that will cut off his head, save only that one.' ...|$|R
