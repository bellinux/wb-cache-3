5000|$|Each unit is {{equipped}} with four ready-to-fire missiles and an optical day and night sight to continually point the laser beam at the target. This means the system makes use of ACLOS type of guidance. Since the <b>laser</b> <b>receiver</b> {{is located at the}} back of the missile the system is practically immune to jamming but the method can be hampered by very low-visibility atmospheric conditions. [...] Finland placed the first order in August 2002. The Finnish systems are mounted on Sisu Nasus (four units) and Mercedes-Benz Unimog 5000 L/38 4x4s (12 units).

50|$|In pursuit guidance, {{the missile}} is steered {{so that the}} {{velocity}} vector of the missile always points at the target, i.e. it has always {{the direction of the}} line of sight. In the early days of guided missiles where the computers were analog this was an easy implementation in the hardware. It found particular use in the early laser-guided bombs with the aerodynamically stabilized birdies {{on the front of the}} bomb. The birdies sit on a universal joint and thus will point in the direction of the relative wind. If the <b>laser</b> <b>receiver</b> is placed on this wind stabilized reference, the angle that the laser is off the wind vector is the same as is measured relative to the centerline of the seeker. Thus, the angle is constructed easily in analog hardware.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose to}} deploy small (2 - 3 kg) Lunar geodesy {{packages}} on the Moon's surface, consisting of an optical <b>Laser</b> <b>receiver,</b> a small retroreflector, {{as well as}} a radio beacon. The optical receiver will maintain Earth pointing through the Lunar libration cycles and record arrival times of Laser shots from Earth. Judging from the photon budget for a 50 mJ pulse Laser, most of the existing more than 30 ILRS (International Laser Ranging Service) stations could participate in the experiment and produce large numbers of range measurements at high accuracy and unbiased temporal coverage. The light-weight 0. 5 sqm retroreflector will be adequate for direct ranging measurements using the classic Lunar Laser Ranging stations. The simultaneous acquisition of data from the <b>Laser</b> <b>receiver</b> on the Moon and reflected Laser shots on Earth will allow us to calibrate the onboard clock. A small radio source shall be deployed within the package, for tracking by VLBI stations. The experience from the past 38 years of Apollo Lunar Laser Ranging suggests that there is enormous science potential in ranging data to further our understanding of the Moon's internal structure, the dynamics of the Earth-Moon system and fundamental physics. For example, from the Moon's tidal response, inferences can be made on a solid or liquid Lunar core and its size and oblateness. In addition, parameters from gravitational physics, e. g., the time-stability of the gravitational "constant", or the strong equivalence principle (Nordtvedt-effect) could be modeled with vastly improved accuracy. While the position of the <b>Laser</b> <b>receiver</b> will define an important anchor point in the lunar-fixed coordinate system, the radio transmitter will firmly tie the dynamical reference frame of the Lunar orbit into the quasi-inertial kinematic reference frame of Quasar coordinates for insights into the Moon's orbital behavior to as yet unknown frontiers...|$|E
