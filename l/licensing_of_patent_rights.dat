METHODS Analysis of Ministry of Health purchases of antiretroviral medicines, from 2005 to 2013. Expenditures {{and costs of}} the treatment per year were analyzed and compared to international prices of atazanavir. Price reductions were estimated based on the terms <b>of</b> a voluntary <b>license</b> <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> and technology transfer in the Partnership for Productive Development Agreement for atazanavir. RESULTS Atazanavir, a patented medicine, represented a significant share of the expenditures on antiretrovirals purchased from the private sector. Prices in Brazil were higher than international references, and no evidence was found of a relationship between purchase volume and price paid by the Ministry of Health. Concerning the latest strategy to reduce prices, involving local production of the 200 mg capsule, the price reduction was greater than the estimated reduction. As for the 300 mg capsule, the amounts paid {{in the first two}} years after the Partnership for Productive Development Agreement were close to the estimated values. Prices in nominal values for both dosage forms remained virtually constant between 2011 (the signature of the Partnership for Productive Development Agreement), 2012 and 2013 (after the establishment of the Partnership). CONCLUSIONS Price reduction of medicines is complex in limited-competition environments. The use of a Partnership for Productive Development Agreement as a strategy to increase the capacity of local production and to reduce prices raises issues regarding its effectiveness in reducing prices and to overcome patent barriers. Investments in research and development that can stimulate technological accumulation should be considered by the Government to strengthen its bargaining power to negotiate medicines prices under a monopoly situation...|$|R

For the authors, it was important to demonstrate the impact of co-branding on customer prefer-ences concerning textile products for the example chosen. The aim of the research was to identify behaviours of consumers from the Lodz Voivodeship (Poland) when a co-branding strategy is used. As was proved in the study, the consumers give priority to a co-branded textile product in relation to a classic textile product. However, at the same time, those con-sumers do not give priority to a more expensive co-branded textile product in relation to the classic textile product.

40|$|Current {{mechanisms}} to compensate inventors and improve legal {{access to their}} inventions remain ineffective. Manufacturers encounter significant transaction costs in the process <b>of</b> <b>licensing</b> the multitude <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> implicated in their products. High-technology product manufacturing requires access to a diverse pool of technologies that are owned by different organizations all over the world. The transaction costs <b>of</b> <b>licensing</b> these disparate rights are inhibiting unlicensed manufacturers in emerging economies from entering important markets and simultaneously limiting the revenue patent owners can generate from non-exclusive licenses. As communications technologies improve, innovative licensing mechanisms are emerging that can help firms avoid many of these transaction costs. Search and information costs, bargaining and decision costs, enforcement costs and adjustment costs all limit the value generated from licensing transactions. These costs are particularly severe for smaller firms that lack complementary assets to develop their products, lack experience with licensing {{and do not have}} large human and financial resources to invest in negotiation outcomes. The transaction costs <b>of</b> <b>licensed</b> manufacturing increase exponentially when having to license multiple rights among disparate rightsholders in a global market. By identifying, grouping, and valuing different rights into a single license, PatentBooks, an illustration <b>of</b> an electronic <b>patent</b> <b>licensing</b> platform, reduces search and information transaction costs. Firms instantaneously identify appropriate license rights from all over the globe without investing considerable resources in hundreds <b>of</b> discrete negotiations. <b>Patent</b> owners are able to generate greater non-exclusive licensing revenue from manufacturers than they could by licensing their rights in isolation. In doing so, they permit firms of all sizes and nationalities to generate more returns from technology and accelerate innovation by facilitating access to valuable inventions. ...|$|R
40|$|In The Malleability <b>of</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Rights</b> 1, I {{developed}} {{the concept that}} <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> are malleable rather than static and fixed, distinguishing malleability from the idea that <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> are merely uncertain. Malleability refers {{to the idea that}} the strength and scope <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> can be altered by the actors who interact with a patent well after it has issued. Patent law is full of mechanisms that allow for these post-issuance changes, yet {{there seems to be no}} good theoretical argument that supports malleability. At best, I concluded, the costs of malleability must be weighed against the doctrinal cures, and perhaps those cures themselves would come with greater costs of their own. This Essay builds upon The Malleability <b>of</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Rights</b> to explain how viewing <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> as malleable can dramatically alter conventional narratives <b>of</b> the <b>patent</b> system—both narratives told by supporters <b>of</b> strong <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> and narratives told by those who argue that the patent system must be changed to favor competitors.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objectives of}} this paper are to estimate and analyse the private value <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> in the United Kingdom, France and Germany during the post- 1950 period, and to provide and consider some implications of an index of the `quality' (or average private value) <b>of</b> <b>patents.</b> Since <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> are seldom marketed, their private value is in general unobserved. This paper makes inferences on the value <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> from the economic responses of patentees. in most countries patentees must pay an annual renewal fee {{in order to keep}} their patents in force. If it is assumed that agents make renewal decisions based on the value <b>of</b> the <b>patent</b> <b>right</b> obtained by renewal, then data on patent renewals and renewal fee schedules contain information on the distribution of the value <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> <b>rights.</b> In Section I we outline a simple economic model <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> renewal decisions which, when combined with the renewal data, allows us to estimate the distribution of the private value <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> protection. Section II describes the data set and provides some simple nonparametric evidence on shifts in the patent value distribution over time. In Section III we parameterise the model, and then present and discuss the estimates. This includes some discussion of the empirical correlates of intertemporal changes in the value distribution. Section IV derives estimates of the quantiles of the distribution of the value <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> <b>rights,</b> and compares our results to information on both the distribution of the value <b>of</b> <b>patented</b> ideas and on the resource cost of producing them.
