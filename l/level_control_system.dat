This distortion commonly appears as envelope power overshoot on leading edges, and sometimes causes negative carrier shift on AM. Some poorer designed transceivers have a short term envelope power overshoot several times the steady-state PEP setting. This envelope overshoot further complicates definitions of PEP and average power.|$|E

The new channel is called the Neue Donau (New Danube). After the completion of the works it was envisaged that the resulting island should eventually be used for recreation. The flood control system is designed to protect from flash floods bringing river flows of up to 14,000 m3 per second. This has only happened once in Vienna's history; in 1501. The heavy 2002 flood brought flows of 10,000 m3 per second. It includes the Danube Canal's historic Nu√üdorf watergate, locks at either end of New Danube, a groundwater <b>level</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> integrated into the right bank flood levee (which creates appropriate conditions for the large park area Prater, once part of a wide alluvial forest zone), and the new Freudenau river plant's sluice.|$|E

According to these disturbances we need to implement better tuning algorithms to PID controllers. But industrial conventional PID controllers exhibits nonlinear output for the given error values. Thus the approach of non linear PID controller is to include the disturbance parameters to conventional PID controller. The behavior is observed with step input.

40|$|ABSTRACT:-The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate and find a solution by designing the intelligent controller for controlling water level system, such as neural network. The controller also can be specifically run under the circumstance of system disturbances. To achieve these objectives, a prototype of water <b>level</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> has been built and implementations of both PID and neural network control algorithms are performed. In PID control, Ziegler Nichols tuning method is used to control the system. In neural network control, the approach of Model Reference Adaptive Neural Network (ANN) Control based on the back propagation algorithm is applied on training the system. Both control algorithms are developed to embed into a standalone DSP-based micro-controller and their performances are compared.
