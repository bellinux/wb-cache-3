50|$|<b>Loop</b> <b>scavenging,</b> disc {{valves and}} {{expansion}} chambers {{worked in a}} highly coordinated way to significantly increase the power output of two-stroke engines, particularly from the Japanese manufacturers Suzuki, Yamaha and Kawasaki. Suzuki and Yamaha enjoyed success in grand Prix motorcycle racing in the 1960s due in no small way to the increased power afforded by <b>loop</b> <b>scavenging.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Often {{referred}} to as [...] "Schnuerle" [...] (or [...] "Schnürle") <b>loop</b> <b>scavenging</b> after the German inventor of an early form in the mid-1920s, it became widely adopted in that country during the 1930s and spread further afield after World War II.|$|E
50|$|In practice, the gasflow {{failed to}} follow the {{idealised}} pattern. The rib of the deflector piston also gave a poor shape for the combustion chamber, with long flame paths and excessive surface area.

40|$|Two-stroke {{diesel engines}} {{could be a}} {{promising}} solution for reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from light-duty vehicles. The main objective {{of this study was}} to assess the potential of two-stroke engines in achieving a substantial reduction in CO 2 emissions compared to four-stroke diesel baselines. As part of this study 1 -D models were developed for <b>loop</b> <b>scavenged</b> two-stroke and opposed piston two-stroke diesel engine concepts. Based on the engine models and an in-house vehicle model, projections were made for the CO 2 emissions for a representative light-duty vehicle over the New European Driving Cycle and the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure. The <b>loop</b> <b>scavenged</b> two-stroke engine had about 5 - 6 % lower CO 2 emissions over the two driving cycles compared to a state of the art four-stroke diesel engine, while the opposed piston diesel engine had about 13 - 15 % potential benefit. Opposed piston two-stroke engines offer the potential for even higher thermal efficiency than <b>loop</b> <b>scavenged</b> two-stroke engines. The efficiency advantages of the opposed piston two-stroke engine are mainly because of lower in-cylinder heat losses due to elimination of the cylinder head and lower surface area to volume ratio. The thermal efficiency of a <b>loop</b> <b>scavenged</b> two-stroke engine can be potentially further improved by using thermal barrier materials for incylinder surfaces to minimize heat losses. Analytical studies show that integration of thermal barrier materials and two-stroke <b>loop</b> <b>scavenged</b> engine could lead to a cost effective highly efficient diesel engine. Whether the theoretical benefit translates to actual CO 2 emissions reduction will have to be verified experimentally...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} make clear how the efflux angle changes in a small {{crankcase}} scavenged engine cylinder and in a large <b>loop</b> <b>scavenged</b> engine cylinder, the inlet flow pattern in the single cycle model cylinder has been observed by a high speed motion camera. In general, the scavenging air stream is not effluent in the designed direction of the scavenging port at comparatively slight opening, and the efflux angle changes in proportion to port opening advance. In a small crankcase scavenged engine cylinder, to keep the scavenging air stream {{in the direction of}} the scavenging port it is effective to incline the scavenging air passage between the crankcase and the cylinder, and to make thicker the cylinder wall where located scavenging port. In a large <b>loop</b> <b>scavenged</b> engine cylinder to coincide the scavenging air stream with the direction of the scavenging port in the early stage of the scavenging, it has an effect to set the guide plate the position of 1 / 2 at port height...|$|R
5000|$|Initially {{they were}} fitted with eight-cylinder two-stroke, port-controlled Crossley engines. These were a <b>loop</b> <b>scavenge</b> type, which {{utilised}} a patented principle that recycled the normally wasted exhaust-pressure pulse to boost charge {{air in the}} cylinder. They produced [...] at 625 rpm and could do 120 km/h. The original sandboxes, which were used to improve traction with the rail, were removed after a few years.|$|R
50|$|<b>Loop</b> <b>scavenging</b> is {{the most}} common type of fuel/air mixture {{transfer}} used on modern two-stroke engines. Suzuki was one of the first manufacturers outside of Europe to adopt loop-scavenged two-stroke engines. This operational feature was used in conjunction with the expansion chamber exhaust developed by German motorcycle manufacturer, MZ and Walter Kaaden.|$|E
5000|$|An {{additional}} benefit of <b>loop</b> <b>scavenging</b> was the piston {{could be made}} nearly flat or slightly dome shaped, which allowed the piston to be appreciably lighter and stronger, and consequently to tolerate higher engine speeds. The [...] "flat top" [...] piston also has better thermal properties and is less prone to uneven heating, expansion, piston seizures, dimensional changes and compression losses.|$|E
50|$|Scavenging {{of small}} {{two-stroke}} engines relies on inertial scavenging through the Kadenacy effect. At low rpm and low gasflow velocities, {{this effect is}} reduced. Scavenging thus becomes less effective when idling, {{and so it is}} when idling (at either low rpm or low throttle) that four-stroking is most likely to become a problem. Schnuerle or <b>loop</b> <b>scavenging</b> is considered to be less prone than the simpler cross-scavenging.|$|E
2500|$|It was air-cooled, petroil-lubricated and {{featured}} a <b>loop</b> <b>scavenge</b> design with two opposed main transfer ports supplemented {{by a third}} [...] "boost" [...] port opposite the exhaust. This arrangement was patented by Scott in 1939, but is often mistakenly believed to be of post-war origin as it was later widely adopted for motorcycle racing engines and power boats after its reinvention in the late 1950s by East German motorcycle manufacturer MZ.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{in-cylinder}} characteristic {{is important to}} understand the scavenging process of the two-stroke engine. It is important to design a new two-stroke engine to produce low emission that will meet current and future emission regulation. The objective of the paper is to evaluate and analyze a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulation of the flow in motored <b>loop</b> <b>scavenged</b> two-stroke engine using commercial software FLUENT and compare with experimental data. The experiment is carried out using the motored method which the rotating engine is generated using motor and without firing. The data is collected at different engine speed from the engine idle speed to maximum engine speed.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This is a copyright-cleared version of the Thesis. Despite challenges with poor emissions and fuel economy, gasoline two stroke engines continue to be developed {{for a number of}} applications. The primary reasons for the choice of a gasoline two stroke engine includes its low cost, mechanical simplicity and high specific power output. Some applications for the gasoline two stroke engine include small capacity motorcycles and scooters, off road recreational vehicles, hand held power tools and unmanned aerial vehicles. New technologies, which are already mature in four stroke engines, are now being applied to two stroke engines. Such technologies include direct fuel injection, electronic engine management and exhaust gas after treatment. To implement these new technologies computation models are being continuously developed to improve the design process of engines. Multi-dimensional computational fluid dynamics modelling is now commonly applied to engine research and development, it is a powerful tool that can give great insight into the thermofluid working of an engine. Multi-dimensional tools are however computationally expensive and quasi-dimensional modelling methods are often better suited for the analysis of an engine, for example in transient engine simulation. This thesis reports {{the development of a new}} quasi-dimensional combustion model for a <b>loop</b> <b>scavenged</b> two stroke engine. The model differs from other quasi-dimensional models available in the literature as it accounts for a bulk motion of the flame front due to the tumble motion created by the <b>loop</b> <b>scavenge</b> process. In this study the tumble motion is modelled as an ellipsoid vortex and the size of the vortex is defined by the combustion chamber height and a limiting elliptical aspect ratio. The limiting aspect ratio has been observed in experimental square piston compression machines and optical engines. The new model also accounts for a wrinkled flame brush thickness and its effects on the interaction between flame front and combustion chamber. The new combustion model has been validated against experimental engine tests in which the flame front propagation was measured using ionization probes. The probes were able determine the flame front shape, the bulk movement of the flame front due to tumble and also the wrinkled flame brush thickness...|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s DKW {{pioneered the}} Schnürle {{two-stroke}} <b>loop</b> <b>scavenging</b> process {{to dispense with}} the use of a deflector piston and improve efficiency of the combustion chamber. DKW also developed a highly efficient arrangement of transfer ports. These two features were included in the RT 125 to great commercial advantage. Competitor companies such as Adler and TWN copied the adoption of flat-topped pistons and strove to develop equally transfer port arrangements without infringing DKW's patent.|$|E
50|$|The 750 cc {{standard}} engine produced 36 to 42 hp, {{depending on}} the model year. The Monte Carlo Rally variant, 750 cc (with a filled crankshaft for higher base compression), generated 65 hp. An 850 cc version was available in the 1966 SAAB Sport (a standard trim model {{in comparison to the}} deluxe trim of the Monte Carlo).Base compression comprises a portion of the overall compression ratio of a two-stroke engine.Work published at SAE in 2012 points that <b>loop</b> <b>scavenging</b> is under every circumstance more efficient than cross-flow scavenging.|$|E
50|$|While a 4-stroke engine {{uses the}} piston as a {{positive}} displacement pump to accomplish scavenging taking 2 of the 4 strokes, a 2-stroke engine uses {{the last part of}} the power stroke and the first part of the compression stroke for combined intake and exhaust. The work required to displace the charge and exhaust gases comes from either the crankcase or a separate blower. For scavenging, expulsion of burned gas and entry of fresh mix, two main approaches are described: <b>Loop</b> <b>scavenging,</b> and Uniflow scavenging, SAE news published in the 2010s that 'Loop Scavenging' is better under any circumstance than Uniflow Scavenging.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} Single Cylinder Test Engine Program {{is conducted}} {{to confirm the}} analytically projected performance of a two-stroke cycle diesel engine for aircraft applications. The test engine delivered 78 kW indicated power from 1007 cc displacement, operating at 3500 RPM on Schnuerle <b>loop</b> <b>scavenged</b> two-stroke cycle. Testing confirms {{the ability of a}} proposed 4 -cylinder version of such an engine to reach the target power at altitude, in a highly turbocharged configuration. The experimental program defines all necessary parameters to permit design of a multicylinder engine for eventual flight applications; including injection system requirement, turbocharging, heat rejection, breathing, scavenging, and structural requirements. The multicylinder engine concept is configured to operate with an augmented turbocharger, but with no primary scavenge blower. The test program is oriented to provide a balanced turbocharger compressor to turbine power balance without an auxiliary scavenging system. Engine cylinder heat rejection to the ambient air has been significantly reduced and the minimum overall turbocharger efficiency required is within the range of commercially available turbochargers. Analytical studies and finite element modeling is made of insulated configurations of the engines - including both ceramic and metallic versions. A second generation test engine is designed based on current test results...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1930s Scott {{manufactured}} {{a number}} of stationary engines {{with the aim of}} raising funds following the decline in motorcycle sales. Some of these engines were derived from motorcycle units, for instance the DSE was a watercooled version of the Lightweight Squirrel engine and the SE had the same bore and stroke dimensions as the long stroke Flyers. It has come to light that the SE does not have the same bore size as the Long Stroke Flyer (73 mm) but has a bore size of 78 mm, this has been confirmed on two Scott SE engines. The PA stationary engine however was different. Designed to meet a Ministry requirement for a portable electrical generator for the Bofors anti-aircraft gun and its Kerrison Predictor, it was produced during the Second World War by both Scott and its former partners Jowett.It was air-cooled, petroil-lubricated and featured a <b>loop</b> <b>scavenge</b> design with two opposed main transfer ports supplemented by a third [...] "boost" [...] port opposite the exhaust.

40|$|The paper compares two {{different}} design concepts {{for a range}} extender engine rated at 30 kW at 4500 rpm. The first project is a conventional 4 -Stroke SI engine, 2 -cylinder, 2 -valve, equipped with port fuel injection. The second is {{a new type of}} 2 -Stroke <b>loop</b> <b>scavenged</b> SI engine, featuring a direct gasoline injection and a patented rotary valve for enhancing the induction and scavenging processes. Both power units have been virtually designed with the help of CFD simulation. Moreover, for the 2 -Stroke engine, a prototype has been also built and tested at the dynamometer bench, allowing the authors to make a reliable theoretical comparison with the well assessed 4 -Stroke unit. Even if the optimized design of each one of the two engines {{is similar to that of}} existing prototypes, the paper is not intended to be a benchmarking, but a general study, aimed to define the fundamental project guidelines and compare different solutions under the same conditions, including the unavoidable arbitrary hypotheses. The main results of the comparison may be summarized as follows: the 2 -Stroke engine is more compact and light (â? 38 % of frontal area, 35 vs. 50 kg); its fuel efficiency is slightly better, and further improvements are possible running on stratified charge; the reduction of NOx in the 2 -S catalyst may not be complete, due to the unavoidable air short-circuit...|$|R
50|$|In a {{cross-flow}} engine, {{the transfer}} and exhaust ports are {{on opposite sides}} of the cylinder, and a deflector on the top of the piston directs the fresh intake charge into the upper part of the cylinder, pushing the residual exhaust gas down the other side of the deflector and out the exhaust port. The deflector increases the piston's weight and exposed surface area, affecting piston cooling and also making it difficult to achieve an efficient combustion chamber shape. This design has been superseded since the 1960s by the <b>loop</b> <b>scavenging</b> method (below), especially for motorbikes, although for smaller or slower engines, such as lawn mowers, the cross-flow-scavenged design can be an acceptable approach.|$|E
5000|$|The Detroit Diesel Series 51 was a {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engine}} built by General Motors, Detroit Diesel Division from 1951 to 1959. Unlike other GM/Detroit Diesel engines, the 51 series designation did {{not refer to}} the cylinder displacement, but rather to the year it was introduced. Two versions were produced, an inline two-cylinder (2-51, 108 cid L) and an inline four-cylinder model (4-51, 216 cid L). It was a simplified version of the Series 53 {{that did not have}} exhaust valves. This was accomplished by using <b>loop</b> <b>scavenging</b> ports for both intake and exhaust along with a mechanical blower. This engine used a dry sleeve with 9 intake ports and three exhaust ports in that sleeve. These sleeves were located {{in such a way that}} the exhaust ports lined up with exhaust ports in the block that were physically higher than the intake ports in the block. This resulted in pressurized cool air being forced through the intake ports just after the exhaust started exiting (note that the exhaust ports in the sleeves were higher at the top than the intake ports while the bottom of all ports in the sleeve are at the same height. The net compression ratio is 18:1. Unlike a two cycle gasoline engine, the crankcase was not used to draw in the fuel/air mixture. Instead, the blower forced air in the intake ports and fuel was injected by a camshaft actuated injector which was pressurized by a gear pump. As fuel is injected just before top dead center, little unburned fuel is expelled in the exhaust, unlike a two-cycle gasoline engine. The elimination of exhaust valves reduced the complexity and weight of the engine. The power output and RPM of this engine was controlled by governing the intake air and controlling the opening of the injectors with shutdown accomplished by completely closing off the air intake. The much lower weight of this engine compared to engines with valves made it quite suitable for applications where other engines of the same horsepower were not feasible. Its uses include: Marine propulsion, generators, pumps, air compressors, road graders and other industrial uses. It was never factory installed for automotive purposes but conversion kits and engines were made available for automotive use. This engine design did not see widespread use due to not being able to reduce the exhaust noise to an acceptable level, as any exhaust restriction would have resulted in a reduction of power and efficiency. It was a very fuel efficient engine with a high power output to fuel consumption ratio.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} virtual design process of an {{automotive}} HSDI 2 -Stroke Diesel engine, {{developed at the}} Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering (DIMeC) of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a numerical investigation, {{aimed to explore}} the potential of 2 -stroke Diesel engines, able to meet Euro VI requirements, for application to medium size commercial vehicles (power rate: 80 kW at 2600 rpm, max. torque 420 Nm from 1200 to 1400 rpm). The study is based on experimental performance of a highly developed 4 -stroke engine. Two different designs are considered: <b>Loop</b> and Uniflow <b>scavenging,</b> the latter obtained through an opposed piston configuration. In both cases, no poppet valves are used, and the lubrication is provided by a 4 -stroke-like oil sump. The study started {{with the development of}} a 4 -stroke EURO VI engine, {{on the basis of a}} previous EURO IV version. A prototype of the new engine (named 430) was built and tested. The second phase of the study consisted in the comparison to the 2 -stroke configurations, considering the same performance and emissions targets, as well as the same constraints Engine outputs are calculated by using GT-Power models: while for the 4 -stroke unit these results are fully supported by experimental data, the 2 -strokes are just "paper" engines. However, the CFD- 1 D modeling was supported by other detailed numerical simulations, including both scavenging and combustion analyses. The two stroke concepts analyzed in the paper appear to yield several advantages, in comparison to their 4 -stroke counterpart: reduced fuel consumption, cleaner combustion conditions, more compact dimensions, higher flexibility of the EGR control. On the other hand, they require a strong effort for the development of a specific combustion system...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a brief {{bibliography}} survey and experimental activity concerning an unconventional combustion process for two-stroke gasoline engines. Auto-ignition is an interesting combustion process which takes place at light loads and turns the effect of residual gas from negative aspect to positive since their thermal energy is used to prime auto-ignition of the fresh gas. This leads to very good combustion quality with very small cycle to cycle variations, to low specific fuel consumption and to low exhaust emissions of carbon monoxyde and unburned hydrocarbons. The name A. T. AC. (Active Thermo Atmosphere Combustion) was chosen by Onishi et al. who presented the first industrial application of this unconventional combustion process to a portable generator (NICE 10) in 1979. Research work on the auto-ignition combustion {{have been carried out}} since early 1970 ’s. More recently, a famous demonstration of the potential of an engine designed {{with a wide range of}} controlled auto-ignition combustion process (Activated Radicals Combustion) has been performed by the HONDA EXP 2 motorcycles during the 1995 Grenada Dakar Rally. Today, more and more stringent legislations for highly polluting two-stroke engines appear and this auto-ignition combustion process is a promising way to help to cope new regulations. In order to better understand and control this combustion process far a wide industrial application, it seems necessary to study this phenomenon thoroughly. The experimental work presented in this paper was performed on both <b>loop</b> and cross <b>scavenged</b> two-stroke engines. Different engines parameters and setting as well as compression ratio, transfer duct configuration and air/fuel ratio have been investigated to evaluate their effect an the autoignition.

The paper show propagation of the flame in the combustion chamber depending on charge flow after scavenge process. The paper presents several examples of heat release and approximate function, for which variable coefficients of Viebe function were determined for certain rotational speeds at wide openning throttle. Pressure measurements were carried out on the engine Robin EC 12 wit capacity 115 cm 3. Determination of heat release and burned fuel rate was calculated by means of own computer program.

40|$|Interest in 2 -stroke engines {{has been}} {{recently}} renewed by several prototypes, {{developed for the}} automotive and/or the aircraft field. <b>Loop</b> <b>scavenging,</b> with piston controlled ports is particularly attractive, but the configurations successfully developed {{in the past for}} motorbike racing (in particular, the 125 cc unit displacement, crankcase pump engines), are not suitable for automotive applications. Therefore, new criteria are necessary to address the scavenging system design of the new generation of 2 -stroke automobile/aircraft engines. The paper reviews the transfer ports optimization of a loop scavenged 2 -stroke cylinder, whose main parameters were defined in a previous study. The optimization has been carried by means of a parametric grid, considering 3 parameters (2 tilt angles, and the focus distance), and 3 different engine speeds (2000 - 3000 - 4000 rpm, assuming a Diesel engine). A set of scavenging CFD- 3 d simulations have been performed by using a customized version of KIVA- 3 V. The numerical approach was experimentally calibrated in a previous project (see appendix 1) The simulations results are presented by means of maps showing the influence of the geometrical parameters on the main scavenging coefficients. Finally, a refined mesh has been constructed for the optimum configuration found in the previous parametric analysis, and a set of multi-cycle simulations have been performed. The results demonstrated the very good efficiency of the scavenging process, close to a perfect displacement for delivery ratio up to 1. 5, or for residuals fraction higher than 50...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a numerical study, supported by experiments, on light aircraft 2 -Stroke Direct Injected Diesel engines, typically rated up to 110 kW (corresponding to about 150 imperial HP). The engines {{must be as}} light as possible and {{they are to be}} directly coupled to the propeller, without reduction drive. The ensuing main design constraints are: i) in-cylinder peak pressure as low as possible (typically, no more than 120 bar); ii) maximum rotational speed limited to 2600 rpm. As far as exhaust emissions are concerned, piston aircraft engines remain unregulated but lack of visible smoke is a customer requirement, so that a value of 1 is assumed as maximum Smoke number. For the reasons clarified in the paper, only three cylinder in line engines are investigated. Reference is made to two types of scavenging and combustion systems, designed by the authors with the assistance of state-of-the-art CFD tools and described in detail in a parallel paper. The former is a uniflow system, featuring two exhaust valves per cylinder in the engine head, piston controlled inlet ports and a combustion bowl in the piston; the latter is a loop scavenged design, with both inlet and exhaust ports controlled by the piston, and a non conventional combustion chamber in the engine head (no bowl in the piston). All the calculations presented in the paper are performed by using GT-Power models calibrated by means of CFD- 3 D calculations (by KIVA- 3 V) and experiments. The experimental support is provided by two engines: the former is a modern commercial aircraft 2 -Stroke Diesel engine, indirect injected, uniflow scavenged; the latter is a research engine based on an old marine unit, featuring <b>loop</b> <b>scavenging</b> and direct injection.
