25|$|Precoding is multi-stream beamforming, in {{the narrowest}} definition. In more general terms, it is {{considered}} to be all spatial processing that occurs at the transmitter. In (single-stream) beamforming, the same signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with appropriate phase and gain weighting such that the signal power is maximized at the receiver input. The benefits of beamforming are to increase the received signal gain – by making signals emitted from different antennas add up constructively – and to reduce the multipath fading effect. In <b>line-of-sight</b> <b>propagation,</b> beamforming results in a well-defined directional pattern. However, conventional beams are not a good analogy in cellular networks, which are mainly characterized by multipath propagation. When the receiver has multiple antennas, the transmit beamforming cannot simultaneously maximize the signal level at all of the receive antennas, and precoding with multiple streams is often beneficial. Note that precoding requires knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and the receiver.|$|E

This effect is typical of the so-called chiral-metamaterials in (4 – 10) THz band, and is of stimulating interest particularly for millimeter wireless communications. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of specific parameters of a chiral-metamaterial, like the relative electrical permit-tivity, magnetic permeability and chirality coefficients, and from that we derive the channel behavior both for Line-of-Sight and No <b>Line-of-Sight</b> <b>propagations.</b> We notice the presence of spectral windows, due to peaks of resonance of chiral parameter.

40|$|Abstract — A hybrid TDOA/AOA {{positioning}} {{technique for}} indoor ultra wideband (UWB) systems {{is presented in}} this paper. The UWB system is a potential candidate for improving the location accuracy of indoor positioning due to the fine-resolution characteristic of the UWB signals.

The non <b>line-of-sight</b> (NLOS) <b>propagation</b> error {{is considered one of}} the major error sources in location systems. Mitigation techniques are generally utilized to reduce the time-based NLOS errors. Inaccurate AOA information in the NLOS environment therefore becomes the major error source in positioning and tracking. An AOA selection process is presented for suppressing the impact. An adjustable EKF structure for the selected TDOA/AOA information is used in the indoor geolocation architecture. The simulation results show that the proposed hybrid technique can effectively respond to the NLOS/LOS changes in the UWB environment, and can efficiently improve the position accuracy...|$|R
