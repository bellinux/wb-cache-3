40|$|The light {{activation}} of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) in vivo requires {{the presence of}} Rubisco activase, a nuclear-encoded chloroplast protein that consists of two isoforms arising from alternative splicing in most plants. We examined the function of each isoform by characterizing Rubisco activation in transgenic Arabidopsis plants that express only one or both isoforms, {{as compared with the}} wild type. In plants expressing only the shorter isoform, Rubisco activity was as high as in the wild type under saturating light, but the activity was not down-regulated at intensities limiting for photosynthesis. In contrast, in plants expressing only the longer isoform, Rubisco activity was down-regulated at <b>limiting</b> <b>light,</b> but the activity was slightly lower and increased much more slowly at saturating light intensities as compared with the wild type. Light regulation of Rubisco similar to that in the wild-type plants was observed in the progeny of a genetic cross of these two transformants in which both isoforms were again present. When the capacity to redox regulate the activity of the larger activase isoform was eliminated by replacement of the critical cysteine residues in the carboxyl-terminal extension unique to this isoform, Rubisco activity in saturating light was similar to the wild type, but the ability of the larger isoform to down-regulate Rubisco activity at <b>limiting</b> <b>light</b> intensities in transgenic plants was almost abolished. These results indicate that the light modulation of Rubisco under <b>limiting</b> <b>light</b> is mainly due to the ability to regulate the activity of Rubisco activase by redox changes in the stroma...|$|R

5000|$|Instead of {{reducing}} the aperture to <b>limit</b> <b>light,</b> the photographer can add a ND filter to <b>limit</b> <b>light,</b> and can then set the shutter speed according to the particular motion desired (blur of water movement, for example) and the aperture set as needed (small aperture for maximal sharpness or large aperture for narrow depth of field (subject in focus and background out of focus)). Using a digital camera, the photographer can see the image right away and choose the best ND filter to use for the scene being captured by first knowing the best aperture to use for maximal sharpness desired. The shutter speed would be selected by finding the desired blur from subject movement. The camera would be set up for these in manual mode, and then the overall exposure adjusted darker by adjusting either aperture or shutter speed, noting the number of stops needed to bring the exposure to that which is desired. That offset would then be the amount of stops needed in the ND filter to use for that scene.Examples of this use include: ...|$|R
50|$|A dark {{area has}} <b>limited</b> <b>light</b> sources, making things hard to see. Exposure to {{alternating}} light and darkness (night and day) has caused several evolutionary adaptations to darkness. When a vertebrate, like a human, enters a dark area, its pupils dilate, allowing more light {{to enter the}} eye and improving night vision. Also, the light detecting cells in the human eye (rods and cones) will regenerate more unbleached rhodopsin when adapting to darkness.|$|R
40|$|In modern societies, vehicle {{surveillance}} {{is considered}} {{as an important}} device that allows law enforcement to govern the society and ensure citizens’ personal safety. Over the past three decades, {{there have been many}} submissions of the research into vehicle surveillance. Such research is typically broken down into two parts: license plate recognition and character recognition. This thesis focuses on licence plate recognition. As surveillance operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, which includes night time or <b>limited</b> <b>light</b> conditions, there has been no compelling evidence to show a mobile licence plate recognition system with optimum performance under <b>limited</b> <b>light</b> or night time conditions. Thus, the motivation of this thesis is to ascertain evidence of performance under <b>limited</b> <b>light</b> conditions. The CMOS camera, the infrared lens filter, and the infrared light source are included in the hardware design apparatus of the hardware architecture necessary for collecting image samples of real world settings. To locate the license plate, a software algorithm is envisaged as to reduce image noise and locate license plate in the image. To minimise image noise, the pre-processing techniques applied are the Gaussian blur, pyramid decomposition and up-sampling. To locate a license plate, the two unique techniques investigated are Canny edge detection and the binary threshold. Other algorithms included in the software design are dilation used for filling gaps in edge boundaries, followed by contour sets used for identifying unique object boundaries and simplifying boundary edges by means of the Dogual-Peucker algorithm. To sustain optimum performance, the Canny edge hysteresis threshold level was examined together with the iteration level of the binary threshold. The surveillance model was tested in four different environments, but only three were successful. The average accuracy across the three environment settings (1500 images) was 97. 53 %, which is above the accepted level in this industry...|$|R
