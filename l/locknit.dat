50|$|By September 1942, 40 cloths {{had been}} {{specified}} (19 wool, 16 cotton, four rayon and one <b>locknit)</b> which all now utilised the CC41 Utility mark, {{designed for the}} Directorate of Civilian Clothing by Reginald Shipp. Though the symbol was intended to mean nothing, the 'two cheeses' looked similar to CC and it was inferred they stood for Civilian Clothing (and not Controlled Cloth or Commodity).|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the elastic elongation and elastic recovery of the elastic warp knittedfabric made of PET(polyethylene terephthalate) and PBT(polybutylene terephthalate) filament. Using 50 / 24 F PET and 50 D/ 24 F PBT in two threadingbars, the tricot, <b>locknit</b> and satin warp knitted fabrics were produced on the E 28 tricot warpknitting machine. The knitting parameters influencing the elastic elongation under 100 N wereanalyzed in terms of fabric structure, yarn run-in speed and drawing density set on machine. Besides, dyeing temperature and heat setting temperature/time were also examined in order toretain proper elastic elongation and elastic recovery. The relationship between elastic elongationand knitting parameter and finishing parameter were analyzed. Finally, the elastic recovery ofPET/PBT warp knitted fabric was examined to demonstrate the elastic property of final finishedfabric. This study could help us to further exploit the use of PET/PBT warp knitted fabric in thedevelopment of elastic garment in future...|$|E
40|$|Derivatives {{of single}} jersey can be {{produced}} by combining the tuck and miss loops in both wale and course direction. But wale wise increment of tuck and miss loops are mostly practiced. This paper focused on spirality which is a common fault of knit fabrics. The wale wise increment of tuck and miss loops, individually have effects on spirality. Total nine single jersey derivatives were knitted to observe the changes. From total study it was perceived with the increment of tuck and miss loops spirality increases and higher spirality was found for miss loop fabrics (10 %, 12. 8 %, 4. 8 % and 6. 3 %) than tuck loop fabrics (2 %, 4 %, 0. 9 % and 2 %). It was also found that an all knit course insertion on pique and cross miss designs reduce the spirality almost to half for lacoste and <b>locknit</b> designs. It means that higher presence of knit loops can reduce the spirality...|$|E
40|$|Strength {{is a very}} {{important}} criterion for any material especially for fabric. To increase the durability and dimensional stability-strength plays a vital role. Of all types of weft knit fabrics single jersey fabric is very popular. This paper focused on the bursting strength of various derivatives of single jersey knit fabric in both grey and finished state. Derivatives of single jersey knit fabrics are found by using tuck and miss loops in corporate with knit loops in wales direction. Higher presence of tuck and miss loops in wales direction affect the bursting strength. From the total analysis it was observed that bursting strength decreases with the increasing of tuck (single pique, double pique, single lacoste, double lacoste) and miss loops (Single cross miss, double cross miss) than all knit loop containing fabric (plain single jersey). It is also observed that the bursting strength decrement of tuck loop containing fabric is higher than miss loop containing fabric as well as the lacoste & <b>locknit</b> fabrics have higher bursting strength than the pique & cross miss fabric...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} percentages of elastane and Nylon yarn on the dimensional and physical properties of elastanelNylon <b>Locknit</b> warp knitted fabrics are investigated. In order {{to investigate the}} properties ofthe fabric, four different samples were knitted by selecting four different run-in ratios of elastane and Nylon. Elastane yarn was kept at a constant elongation of 65 % for all four samples. Two samples were produced keeping constant run-in of nylon yarn and changing the run-in length of elastane yarn. Then elastane yarn run-in was kept constant and produced two other samples. The sample with minimum run-in length of elastane yarn and the highest run-in ratio has the highest value of load at 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % extensions in length direction and the lowest values of load at 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % extensions in width direction. This {{is due to the}} fact that low run in of elastane yarn increases the strain on the yarn and it increases the tightness factor value of the sample and contributes higher load at extension along the length direction of the greige sample. Nylon yarn runner length influences the relaxation behavior of elastane yarn and it leads to reduce the load at extension along the width direction of the sample. Changing of Nylon yarn runner length influence the relaxation behavior of elastane yarn and it has an effect on the load at different extension in width direction and course density of the greige fabric. Results revealed that the effect of elastane content of the sample is more on the load at extension values than the effect of run-in of the Nylon yarn...|$|E
