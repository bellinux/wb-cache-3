Overall, the net change is slightly positive at approximately 82 gigatonnes (Gt) per year (with significant regional variation), reducing global sea-level rise by 0.23 mm per year. However, NASA's Climate Change website indicates an overall trend of greater than 100 gigatonnes of ice loss per year since 2002.|$|E

5|$|No traces {{have yet}} {{been found in}} Scotland of either a Neanderthal {{presence}} or of Homo sapiens during the Pleistocene interglacials. The first indications of humans occur only after the ice retreated in the 11th millennium BC and the current Flandrian interglacial began. Since that time the landscape of Orkney has been altered by both human and natural forces. Initially, sea levels were lower than at present due to the <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> ice that remained. This meant that the Orkney islands may have been attached to the mainland, as was the present-day island of Great Britain to Continental Europe. Much of the North Sea basin was also dry land until after 4000 BC. This would have made travel to northern Scotland relatively easy for early human settlers. The subsequent isostatic rise of land makes estimating post-glacial coastlines a complex task.|$|E

40|$|Desktop Grid is {{increasing}} in popularity because of relatively very low cost and good performance in institutions. Data-intensive applications require data management in scientific experiments conducted by researchers and scientists in Desktop Grid-based Distributed Computing Infrastructure (DCI). Some of these data-intensive applications deal with <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> data. Several solutions for data-intensive applications {{have been proposed}} for Desktop Grid (DG) {{but they are not}} efficient in handling <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> data. Data management in this environment deals with data access and integration, maintaining basic properties of databases, architecture for querying data, etc. Data in data-intensive applications has to be replicated in multiple nodes for improving data availability and reducing response time. Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) is a well established technique for handling <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> data and is widely used on the internet. Its environment is similar to the environment of DG. The performance of existing P 2 P-based solution dealing with generic architecture for replicating <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> data is not efficient in DG-based DCI. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a generic architecture for replicating <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> data efficiently by using P 2 P in BOINC based Desktop Grid. Present solutions for data-intensive applications mainly deal with read only data. New type of applications are emerging which deal <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> data and Read/Write of data. In emerging scientific experiments, some nodes of DG generate new snapshot of scientific data after regular intervals. This new snapshot of data is generated by updating some of the values of existing data fields. This updated data has to be synchronised in all DG nodes for maintaining data consistency. The performance of data management in DG can be improved by addressing efficient data replication and consistency. Therefore, there is need for algorithms which deal with data Read/Write consistency along with replication for <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> data in BOINC based Desktop Grid. The research is to identify efficient solutions for data replication in handling <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> data and maintaining Read/Write data consistency using Peer-to-Peer techniques in BOINC based Desktop Grid. This thesis presents the solutions that have been carried out to complete the research...|$|R

5|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characteristics of volcanic ash are primarily {{controlled by the}} style of volcanic eruption. Volcanoes display a range of eruption styles which are controlled by magma chemistry, crystal content, temperature and dissolved gases of the erupting magma and can be classified using the volcanic explosivity index (VEI). Effusive eruptions (VEI 1) of basaltic composition produce <105 m3 of ejecta, whereas extremely explosive eruptions (VEI 5+) of rhyolitic and dacitic composition can inject large quantities (>109 m3) of ejecta into the atmosphere. Another parameter controlling the amount of ash produced is {{the duration of the}} eruption: the longer the eruption is sustained, the more ash will be produced. For example, {{the second phase of the}} 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull was classified as VEI 4 despite a modest 8 km high eruption column, but the eruption continued for a month, which allowed a <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> ash to be ejected into the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Shadow Dragon {{was first}} {{announced}} in October 2007 at a Nintendo conference, {{where it had}} yet to be given an official title. While a remake, Nintendo has included it in lists of Fire Emblem titles, variously calling it the eleventh or twelfth entry. It was confirmed for a Western release at a press summit in October 2008 for a North American release the following year, with the European release being planned for 2008. The game was localized for the West by external company 8-4: this was due to the <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> text present in the story, which made localizing it internally difficult for Nintendo. Shadow Dragon was released in Japan on August 7, 2008; in Europe on December 5; in North America on February 16, 2009; and in Australia on February 26. The release of Shadow Dragon marked the first time any form of the first Fire Emblem game had been released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|Some {{books such as}} the Yupian or the Meihōki {{were lost}} early in China, because of the {{persecution}} against Buddhism or for other reasons. The titles survived, however, because of the <b>large</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> books previously imported to Japan, which were then subsequently re-exported to China. Today, some of the oldest extant manuscripts of Chinese books dating to the Tang Dynasty are located in Japan. Few of the early imported manuscripts have survived. Some of those that survived are listed as National Treasures below. Twenty Chinese book National Treasures exist that were created in China and subsequently imported to Japan. Of these, 19 date to the Tang Dynasty and one to the Southern Song. The designated items are of various type: six treasures are manuscripts of the Five Classics of Confucianism and associated commentaries, four are poetry and prose anthologies of Chinese poets, calligraphers and Emperor Huizong of Song, four are dictionaries, five are anecdote collections and one is a music score.|$|E

Major tributaries include Kali, Bhadra, Bhavani, Bhima, Malaprabha, Ghataprabha, Hemavathi and Kabini. Periyar, Bharathappuzha, Netravati, Sharavathi, Mandovi and Zuari rivers flow westwards towards the Western Ghats, draining into the Arabian Sea and are fast-moving, owing to the steeper gradient.|$|E

The final report, the Tenth interim report of the committee, was launched by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on 24 January 2006. It recommended no change to the constitutional definitions, as it expected such a referendum to fail. It suggested that there should instead be legislation for a civil partnership registration open to same-sex or opposite-sex couples which would confer succession, maintenance and taxation rights. Controversially, it also recommended that the 'presumed' recognition of cohabiting partners by the courts, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, should also be legislated for, but only for opposite-sex couples. The basis for the limitation {{was that it would}} be easy for the courts to determine the validity of an opposite-sex relationship if there were children.|$|E

Slavery became an election issue, bringing more abolitionist MPs into the House of Commons, including former military men who had personally experienced the horrors of slavery and slave revolts. Wilberforce was re-elected as an MP for Yorkshire, after which he returned to finishing and publishing his Letter, in reality a 400-page book which formed the basis for the final phase of the campaign.|$|E
