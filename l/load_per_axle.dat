50|$|According to a McKinsey report, India has ~500 {{kilometers}} of paved road per 1000 square kilometers, but the road quality is well below global standards, close to 90% of highways are structurally inadequate {{to support the}} 10.2 tonne <b>load</b> <b>per</b> <b>axle</b> that trucks carry.

5000|$|The Class 1E builders, works numbers, {{years of}} {{construction}} and modifications to Classes ES and 1ES {{are listed in}} the table. The axle load and adhesive weight as shown under [...] "Specifications" [...] in the infobox may be considered as average figures for the Class 1E since these weights varied between the seven series.

2500|$|As an example, {{a typical}} modern wagon can {{hold up to}} [...] of freight on two four-wheel bogies. The track {{distributes}} {{the weight of the}} train evenly, allowing significantly greater <b>loads</b> <b>per</b> <b>axle</b> and wheel than in road transport, leading to less wear and tear on the permanent way. This can save energy compared with other forms of transport, such as road transport, which depends on the friction between rubber tyres and the road. Trains have a small frontal area in relation to the load they are carrying, which reduces air resistance and thus energy usage.|$|R
25|$|The BB40-2 is an EMD rebuild for Ferrovia Central Atlantico in Brazil. Since FCA is metre gauge, {{there was}} no longer enough room in the trucks for the {{original}} traction motors.

50|$|In road transport, an {{oversize}} load (or overweight load) is a load that exceeds the standard or ordinary legal size and/or weight limits for a specified portion of road, highway or other transport infrastructure, such as air freight or water freight. There are also <b>load</b> <b>per</b> <b>axle</b> limits. However, a load that exceeds the per-axle limits, {{but not the}} overall weight limits, is considered overweight. Examples of oversize/overweight loads include construction machines (cranes, front loaders, backhoes, etc.), pre-built homes, containers, construction elements (bridge beams, generators, windmill propellers, rocket stages, industrial equipment).|$|E
50|$|While {{standard}} German {{freight train}} steam locomotives were 2-10-0 types, between 1917 and 1924 the Esslingen locomotive works produced 44 {{units of the}} so-called Class K for the Royal Württemberg State Railways (later renumbered to class 59 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn). With {{a top speed of}} only 60 km/h these locomotives were designed for heavy duty in mountainous areas such as the Geislinger Steige, with special attention on low <b>load</b> <b>per</b> <b>axle</b> (16 t). During World War II, after electrification of that line the units were used on the Semmering railway in Austria, then part of the German Reich. The last four units were in service until 1957.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} in India Calthrop {{developed}} his ideas {{on the construction of}} narrow-gauge railways.

He settled on a <b>loading</b> of [...] <b>per</b> <b>axle,</b> which was light enough to allow railway lines to be built with [...] rail. It also allowed the loading of one [...] capacity 4-wheel standard-gauge wagon to be carried on a single bogie narrow-gauge wagon. Further, he argued that using a track gauge of [...] gave the greatest capacity as a percentage of capital cost. He estimated a [...] gauge railway could be built to four times the length of a standard-gauge railway for the same capital cost.|$|R
40|$|Flexible {{pavement}} {{is usually}} designed based on certain axle load limits and climatic conditions. The Egyptian code has specified certain <b>load</b> limits <b>per</b> each <b>axle</b> type {{that should not}} be exceeded. However, many trucks violate these limits by carrying additional weights to decrease the transportation cost. These overweight trucks cause severe deterioration to the pavement and thus reduce its life. The Egyptian authorities generally charges the violating trucks a penalty based on their weights. This penalty could be very small compared to the damage occurring to the pavement based on these over weights. Also, some trucks may carry huge weights that the pavement may not support, so unloading such trucks could be the suitable solution rather than paying few amount of money and deteriorating the pavement. The study aims at studying th...|$|R
5000|$|The {{frame of}} the ICF bogie is a {{fabricated}} structure made up of mild steel. Main sub-assemblies of bogie frame viz. side frames, transoms, headstocks, longitudinal forms the skeleton of the bogie frame. The sub assemblies are fabricated from flanges, webs, channels and Ribs by welding process. Various types of brackets are welded to the frame {{for the purpose of}} primary and secondary suspension arrangement, alternator suspension arrangement and brake rigging arrangement. Various brackets viz. brake hanger brackets, brake lever hanger brackets, brake cylinder fixing brackets, anchor link brackets, bolster spring suspension brackets, alternator suspension brackets, belt tensioning bracket/s, axle box guides, suspension straps are welded on the bogie frames. It involves 40 meters (app.) of welding in a single conventional bogie frame. Based on <b>load</b> carrying capacity <b>per</b> <b>axle,</b> the conventional bogie frames are grouped into two types. They are 13 ton bogie frame and 16 ton bogie frame. 13 ton bogie frames are being used in the bogies of all non-AC mainline coaches and 16 ton bogie frames are being used in bogies of all AC coaches, power cars and diesel multiple unit trailer coaches. EMU Motor Coach type bogie frames, a different design of bogie frame is being used in all coaches of Electric Multiple Units (EMU) and all self-propelled coaches (motor coaches ...|$|R
5000|$|In January 1916, {{the company}} {{answered}} a War Department tender for military supply railways. The specification {{was for a}} [...] gauge locomotive, {{with no more than}} 1 ton of axle <b>load</b> <b>per</b> <b>axle,</b> capable of hauling up to 15 tons at 5 mph. The company designed a new locomotive, with outer longitudinal [...] "bent-rail" [...] frame, mounted on two driven axles. The 2JO petrol engine manufactured by W.H.Dorman & Co of Stafford was centre-set in the frame along with its Dixon-Abbott patent gearbox, which drove the unsprung axles through a chain-drive. At one end of the frame the operator sat facing to one side allowing him to drive equally well in either direction, and at the other end was the silencer and the water cooling radiator mounted with fan to provide transverse air flow. A large flywheel gave relatively smooth operation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Semi-trailer {{is one of}} {{the popular}} way to {{transport}} heavy and over dimensional objects by road. Gross laden weight of semi-trailer is fixed based on permitted <b>load</b> <b>per</b> <b>axle</b> as per notifications given in Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. To have higher pay load capacity, unladen weight of the semitrailer should be optimum. Major load (unladen) of semitrailer is shared by the frame hence weight optimization can be done to increase payload capacity of the trailer. In this paper, modeling of frame along with chassis is done and then analyzed using ANSYS Workbench with static structural and optimized by adopting sensitivity analysis in SolidWorks by developing design table with different models and analyzing those model...|$|E
