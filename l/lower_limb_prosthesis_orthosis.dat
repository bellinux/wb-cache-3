Techniques are being developed that enable a more natural movement of the prosthesis to occur, such as targeted muscle reinnervation. These techniques are currently still in the experimental stage. The training schedule of the sportsperson must be balanced against his or her tolerance level to avoid mechanical overstrain, not only around the stump but also on the unaffected side. <b>Lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses</b> that lead to top sporting successes, such as with running, have resulted in discussions about distorted competition.

40|$|Ideal {{prostheses}} {{are defined}} as artificial limbs that would permit physically impaired individuals freedom of movement and independence rather than a life of disability and dependence. Current <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses</b> range from a single mechanical revolute joint to advanced microprocessor controlled mechanisms. Despite {{the advancement in technology}} and medicine, current <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses</b> are still lacking an actuation element, which prohibits patients from regaining their original mobility and improving their quality of life. This thesis aims to design and test a Pneumatic Artificial Muscle that would actuate <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses.</b> This would offer patients the ability to ascend and descend stairs as well as standing up from a sitting position. A comprehensive study of knee biomechanics is first accomplished to characterize the actuation requirement, and subsequently a Pneumatic Artificial Muscle design is proposed. A novel design of muscle end fixtures is presented which would allow the muscle to operate at a gage pressure surpassing 2. 76 MPa (i. e. 400 psi) and yield a muscle force that is at least 3 times greater than that produced by any existing equivalent Pneumatic Artificial Muscle. Finally, the proposed Pneumatic Artificial Muscle is tested and validated to verify that it meets the size, weight, kinetic and kinematic requirements of human knee articulation...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a virtual prototyping {{study of a}} semi-active <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prosthesis</b> to improve the functionality of an amputee during prosthesis–environment interaction for level ground walking.

The simulated results show that the semi-active <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prosthesis</b> is able to move efficiently in passive mode, and the activation time of the knee actuator can be reduced by approximately 50 %.

40|$|Modular <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prosthesis</b> is {{composed}} by custom-fit parts, {{such as the}} socket containing the residual limb, and standard components available on market, such as knee or foot. For both custom and standard parts the support offered by existing design tools is not efficient or integrated enough and, as a result, most prosthetists got rid of computer-aided tools and still rely only on their personal expertise. This paper presents an approach to design and configure complete <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prosthesis</b> for transfemoral and transtibial amputees, {{on the base of}} patient’s digital data (e. g. stump model acquired by MRI) and specification sheets of components. The ultimate goal is to realise a virtual laboratory where the technicians can design <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prosthesis</b> guided step by step by the system. We have identified key patient’s characteristics guiding the prosthetist during the four main steps of the production process: acquiring patient’s data, socket modelling, standard components selection and prosthesis assembly and check. The developed innovative framework integrates different tools to guide the technicians during each design task providing specific knowledge and rules. Thus, it allows a quicker and easier definition of the virtual prosthesis, on which virtual test could be performed (e. g. pressure distribution on stump, gait evaluation) {{in order to be able}} to realize the definitive prosthesis at the first attempt.

40|$|Abstract: The dynamic {{analysis}} of the <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prosthesis</b> is necessary mainly for defining the joint mechanical specifications. This paper presents two models of <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Both models have two active joints (ankle and knee) and the same overall dimensions. The main {{difference between the two}} models consists in the joints mechanical parameters. The prosthesis elements are modeled according to the human anatomy, taking into account the weight of the amputated limb. Based on this preliminary data the two models were developed using the Solid Edge V 20 software. The {{dynamic analysis}} was developed in Dynamic Designer Motion Professional module which is a subset of Motion Professional software. The gait cycle time was set to 2 seconds. There were studied two main stages during the gait cycle: extension (from hyper-flexion to hyper-extension), and flexion (vice versa), respectively. The input data are: geometrical model, material properties of the prosthesis elements, gravity force, joint laws of motions and ground reaction forces. Based on this input data the software calculates the path, velocity and acceleration of the prosthesis elements and reaction forces and torques in each joint...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: One of {{the main}} {{indicators}} of the suspension system efficiency in <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses</b> is vertical displacement or pistoning within the socket. Decreasing pistoning and introducing an effective system for evaluating pistoning could contribute to the amputees' rehabilitation process. OBJECTIVES: The main objective {{of this study was}} to review existing research studies that examine the occurrence of pistoning in <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prosthesis</b> with different techniques in static (standing) and dynamic (walking and jumping) positions. STUDY DESIGN: Literature review. METHODS: Keywords related to slippage, suspension, pistoning and vertical movement in <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> prosthetics were used to search the literature available in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases. Sixteen articles were selected for further analysis according to the selection criteria. RESULTS: The following methods have been used to measure the occurrence of pistoning in prosthetic limbs: radiological methods, photographic technique, motion analysis system, sensor and spiral computerized tomography (CT). Pistoning was measured both in standing and walking. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review reveal that further research is needed to develop and evaluate easy, accurate and safe methods of measuring pistoning. Future studies should provide a gold standard for the acceptable range of pistoning in a prosthetic socket...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{deficiency}} at birth, disease or trauma, {{there are people who}} have no limbs from the hip joint downwards. These people have no possibillity of locomotion without the use of other devices such as wheelchairs or hip disarticulation prostheses. As these prostheses are used by people of all ages, people who are different in their grade of physical activities and their weights, the prostheses are subject to different stresses related to these different circumstances. The European Level 2 Draft Standard prEN 12523 : 1966 “External <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses</b> and external orthoses- requirements and test methods ” contains strength requirements for <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses.</b> These requirements shall be verified, where appropriate, by the application of the International Standard IS 0 10328 “Prosthetics- Structural testing of <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses</b> ” and ISOPDIS 15032 “Prosthetics: Structural testing of hip prostheses”. In order to allow the prostheses to be tested to the stresses that are experienced in real life, it is necessary to measure the stress that is induced in the prostheses while the patient is in an every-day situation, such as walking on level floor, walking on grass andor walking on an uneven surface.

40|$|Our goal is the {{development}} of a voluntary control input system for <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses.</b> For this purpose we use electromyography (EMG) with skin surface electrodes which is a common method for non-invasive measurement of electrical potential during muscle contraction which has not yet been applied successfully to <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses</b> due to the difficult signal conditions within the prosthesis socket. Our system will be integrated in the prosthesis socket, making the control system comfortable to wear and easy to use as no electrodes or other parts must be glued to the skin or manually repositioned and placed every day the prosthesis is worn. The control system is designed to allow the user to control a special function within an active powered prosthesis system, e. g. lifting the foot during walking or climbing stairs which are elementary tasks, performed by the subconscious mind of an non-amputee. The control signal is derived by using remaining muscles of the residual <b>limb.</b> The active <b>prosthesis</b> function can be triggered either by a distinct stimulation of the muscle which is observed or by the subconscious muscle stimulation remaining after the amputation.

40|$|Abstract Background Powered <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses</b> {{could be}} more {{functional}} if they had access to feedforward control signals from the user’s nervous system. Myoelectric signals are one potential control source. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if muscle activation signals could be recorded from residual <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> muscles within the prosthetic socket-limb interface during walking. Methods We recorded surface electromyography from three lower leg muscles (tibilias anterior, gastrocnemius medial head, gastrocnemius lateral head) and four upper leg muscles (vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, and gluteus medius) of 12 unilateral transtibial amputee subjects and 12 non-amputee subjects during treadmill walking at 0. 7, 1. 0, 1. 3, and 1. 6 [*]m/s. Muscle signals were recorded from the amputated leg of amputee subjects and the right leg of control subjects. For amputee subjects, lower leg muscle signals were recorded from within the limb-socket interface and from muscles above the knee. We quantified differences in the muscle activation profile between amputee and control groups during treadmill walking using cross-correlation analyses. We also assessed the step-to-step inter-subject variability of these profiles by calculating variance-to-signal ratios. Results We found that amputee subjects demonstrated reliable muscle recruitment signals from residual lower leg muscles recorded within the prosthetic socket during walking, which were locked to particular phases of the gait cycle. However, muscle activation profile variability was higher for amputee subjects than for control subjects. Conclusion Robotic <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses</b> could use myoelectric signals recorded from surface electrodes within the socket-limb interface to derive feedforward commands from the amputee’s nervous system. </p...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a bench for testing different types of <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses.</b> Aim of the bench is to test the prosthetic devices considering working conditions as much as possible similar to the real ones with respect to methodologies provided by International Standards. These standards merely identify structural tests whose purpose is just to verify that the prosthesis, or their individual components, are able to ensure adequate strength properties during their use. The only functional test concern just the ankle-foot units. Test methods for the assessment of the functional performances of the whole prostheses are missing. There are no criterions for such tests and no benches. From this the need to build new test machines that, simulating both the stance and the swing phase according to sought gait standards, allow to assess the functional properties of different <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses</b> and to make comparison between them.

Leading causes of disability among women and children were medical and poliomyelitis. Devices most needed were <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> ortheses (8. 2 devices/ 1000 people; 95 % CI: 5. 9 - 10. 4) and orthopaedic shoes (6. 0 / 1000; 95 % CI: 4. 1 - 8. 0). The need for <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses</b> was less frequent (2. 0 / 1000; 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 2. 8). Most <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputees (mainly victims of landmine injuries) were fitted with an artificial leg, while rehabilitation needs for other types of disability remained largely unmet. We estimated that it would take at least 3 years to provide enough orthopaedic shoes and 10 years for ortheses, whereas the need for <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses</b> could be met in less than 4 months.
