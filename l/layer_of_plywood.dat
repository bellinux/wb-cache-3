2500|$|The {{event in}} {{gymnastics}} performed on floor is called floor exercise. The English abbreviation {{for the event}} in gymnastics scoring is FX. In the past, the floor exercise event was executed on the bare floor or mats such as wrestling mats. The floor event now occurs on a carpeted 12m × 12m square, usually consisting of hard foam over a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>plywood,</b> which is supported by springs generally called a [...] "spring" [...] floor. This provides a firm surface that provides extra bounce or spring when compressed, allowing gymnasts to achieve greater height and a softer landing after the composed skill. Gymnasts perform a choreographed routine up to 90 seconds in the floor exercise event; Depending on the level, they may choose their own, or, if known as a [...] "," [...] default music must be played. Levels three to six the music {{is the same for}} each levels along with the skills within the routine. However, recently, the levels have switched. Now, levels 6-10 are optional levels and they get to have custom routines made. In the optional levels (levels six to ten) there are skill requirements for the routine but the athlete is able to pick her own music without any words. The routine should consist of tumbling passes, series of jumps, leaps, dance elements, acrobatic skills, and turns, or pivots, on one foot. A gymnast can perform up to four tumbling passes that usually includes at least one flight element without hand support. Each level of gymnastics requires the athlete to perform a different number of tumbling passes. In level 7 in the United States, a gymnast is required to do 2–3, and in levels 8–10, at least 3–4 tumbling passes are required.|$|E

5000|$|Charles and Ray Eames {{aimed to}} develop {{furniture}} that could be mass-produced and affordable, {{with the exception of}} the Eames Lounge Chair. This luxury item was inspired by the traditional English Club Chair. The Eames Lounge Chair is an icon of Modern style design, although when it was first made, Ray Eames remarked in a letter to Charles that the chair looked [...] "comfortable and un-designy". Charles's vision was for a chair with [...] "the warm, receptive look of a well-used first baseman's mitt." [...] The chair is composed <b>of</b> three curved <b>plywood</b> shells: the headrest, the backrest and the seat. In early production, beginning in 1956 and running through the very early 1990s, the shells were made up <b>of</b> five thin <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>plywood</b> which were covered by a veneer of Brazilian rosewood. The use of Brazilian rosewood was discontinued in the early 1990s, and current production since then consists <b>of</b> seven <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>plywood</b> covered by finishing veneers of cherry, walnut, Palisander rosewood (a sustainably grown wood with similar grain patterns to the original Brazilian versions), and other finishes.|$|R

This provides a firm surface that will respond with force when compressed, allowing gymnasts to achieve extra height and a softer landing than would be possible on a regular floor. A series of tumbling passes are performed to demonstrate flexibility, strength, balance, and power. The gymnast must also show non-acrobatic skills, including circles, scales, and press handstands. Men's floor routines usually have multiple passes that will total from 60 to 70 seconds, and men perform without music (unlike women gymnasts). Rules require that gymnasts touch each corner of the floor at least once during their routine. Female gymnasts perform a 90-second choreographed routine to instrumental music on the same spring floor used by male gymnasts. Female routines consist of tumbling passes, a series of jumps, several dance elements, acrobatic skill elements, and turns. Elite gymnasts may perform up to four tumbling passes, each of which includes three or more skills.|$|E

5000|$|In this method, the {{exterior}} {{surface of the}} fuselage is also the primary structure. A typical early form of this (see the Lockheed Vega) was built using molded <b>plywood,</b> where the <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>plywood</b> are formed over a [...] "plug" [...] or within a mold. A later form of this structure uses fiberglass cloth impregnated with polyester or epoxy resin, instead <b>of</b> <b>plywood,</b> as the skin. A simple form of this used in some amateur-built aircraft uses rigid expanded foam plastic as the core, with a fiberglass covering, eliminating the necessity of fabricating molds, but requiring more effort in finishing (see the Rutan VariEze). An example of a larger molded plywood aircraft is the de Havilland Mosquito fighter/light bomber of World War II.No plywood-skin fuselage is truly monocoque, since stiffening elements are incorporated into the structure to carry concentrated loads that would otherwise buckle the thin skin.The use of molded fiberglass using negative ("female") molds (which give a nearly finished product) is prevalent in the series production of many modern sailplanes. The use of molded composites for fuselage structures is being extended to large passenger aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner (using pressure-molding on female molds).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of plywood grain direction on bending properties of a sandwich panel, {{as well as on}} stress distribution in each layer. Experimental sandwich panels (tnom= 29 mm) were made of two three-ply plywood panels and a rigid PVC core between them. Grain directions of plywood panels were between 0 ° and 90 °, continuously raised by 15 °. Seven models of sandwich panels were made. Bending properties of a sandwich panel was determined by three point bending method and stress in each layer was determined by using finite element method. Simulation models were developed with equal load conditions as applied during empirical measurement of bending properties of the sandwich panel. The research results show that grain direction has a great influence on bending properties of the sandwich panel, as well as on stress values in each layer.

Especially little is known of these effects for species that nest in burrows or crevices, such as the Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus). On Southeast Farallon Island, California, USA, a subset of the Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s auklet (hereafter auklet) population nest in artificial nest boxes. The nest boxes are above ground and made out of a single <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>plywood.</b> Temperatures in unshaded nest boxes can increase significantly with high ambient temperatures (to 3 ̆e 35 °[*]C). Shaded structures put on top of occupied nest boxes help mediate nest box temperatures, but the effects of elevated temperatures on auklet incubation behaviors and egg viability remain equivocal. We used egg data loggers to measure the temperatures and turning rates of auklet eggs in natural burrows, shaded nest boxes, and unshaded nest boxes on Southeast Farallon Island. Nest box (13. 93 [*]±[*] 1. 26 °[*]C) and egg (37. 43 [*]±[*] 1. 92 °[*]C) temperatures were highest and most variable in unshaded nest boxes. Mean hourly egg turning rate was 2. 11 [*]±[*] 2. 02 turns/hour and turning rates were greater at night. Egg turning rates also varied with fluctuating nest and egg temperatures, being positively correlated with nest temperatures during the day and negatively correlated with egg temperatures during the night. Our results suggest that nest box design can influence incubation behaviors of breeding birds. As seasonal temperatures and the number of extreme heat events rise, understanding the impacts of temperature on auklets nesting in artificial nests can have positive implications for conservation and management of the species, such as implementing improved artificial nest box designs to prevent overheating of burrow nesting seabirds. © 2015 The Wildlife Society...|$|E

Although an early version of the form can be seen in the Malcolm Willey House (1934) in Minneapolis, the Usonian ideal emerged most completely in the Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House (1937) in Madison, Wisconsin. Designed on a gridded concrete slab that integrated the house's radiant heating system, the house featured new approaches to construction, including sandwich walls that consisted <b>of</b> <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> wood siding, <b>plywood</b> cores and building paper, a significant change from typically framed walls. Usonian houses commonly featured flat roofs and were usually constructed without basements or attics, all features that Wright had been promoting since the early 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|The C.II {{had much}} lower drag than {{comparable}} aircraft of its time. It featured a monocoque fuselage built with an outer skin <b>of</b> two <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> thin <b>plywood</b> strips {{at an angle}} to each other (known as a Wickelrumpf, or [...] "wrapped body" [...] design). This had both lower drag and better strength per weight than typical of the time, but it was relatively slow and expensive to build. (This approach was further developed in the de Havilland Mosquito of World War II.) The deep fuselage completely filled the vertical gap between the wing panel center sections, eliminating any need for cabane struts commonly used in biplanes, and gave the aircraft its [...] "whale" [...] nickname. Struts and wires were reduced, without suffering the weight penalty of cantilever wings, like those used on the pioneering all-metal Junkers J 1 of late 1915. There was even some attempt to flair the wings into the fuselage, to eliminate dead air space, a feature prominently missing from the Schneider Trophy contestants of the following decade.The engineer in charge of the design was Tantzen, who was a student of Ludwig Prandtl, the founder of mathematical aerodynamics and the one to introduce the concept <b>of</b> boundary <b>layer.</b>|$|R
