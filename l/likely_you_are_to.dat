50|$|The main {{complaint}} is this ratio {{relies on the}} notions that risk equals volatility and that volatility is bad. Simple logic {{will tell you that}} the more you reduce volatility, the less <b>likely</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> be able to capture higher returns. But the bigger problem for the Sharpe ratio is that it treats all volatility the same. Basically, the ratio penalizes strategies that have upside volatility (i.e., big positive returns), but those that developed other risk adjusted ratios just don’t think big positive returns should be viewed as a negative thing.The Sharpe ratio has as its principal advantage that it is directly computable from any observed series of returns without need for additional information surrounding the source of profitability. Other ratios such as the bias ratio have recently been introduced into the literature to handle cases where the observed volatility may be an especially poor proxy for the risk inherent in a time-series of observed returns.|$|E

Recruitment is a task vital to organizational success and is becoming increasingly problematic for community colleges due to massive retirements {{among members of the}} post-World War II 2 ̆ 2 baby-boomer 2 ̆ 2 generation. The {{participants in this study were}} experienced business professionals (N = 187) completing MBA degrees at a university located in a major metropolitan area in the Midwest. The participants role-played as applicants for community college business faculty vacancies. Each participant rated six jobs manipulated experimentally in simulated position advertisements. The design for this study was a (3 x 2 x S) factorial analysis of variance. The independent variables were starting annual salary (34, 000, 44, 000, 51, 000) and employer-paid health plan (individual, family).

40|$|This {{research}} specifically {{investigates the}} factors that influenced access by households and individuals to credit in the financial sector in Ghana, using the Ghana Living Standards Survey for years 1988 / 89, 1991 / 92 and 1998 / 99. The research sheds light on the extent at which the financial liberalisation policy has affected households and individuals in accessing credit with the view of improving their standard of living. In this research, two sources of credit are identified. Formal credit including debts from commercial banks and other financial institutions; and informal credit including debts from relatives and friends, traders, and moneylenders. Probit, Heckman probit with sample selection, multinomial logit, seemingly unrelated regression estimates and treatment effects models {{were used for the}} analytical work. The results suggest that the different characteristics of households and individuals affect access to credit and these have changed over the time with the implementation of the financial liberalisation policy. An additional result shows that the consumption pattern of households changes with access to credit. At both the national and rural community level, the analysis of the data revealed that you are more likely to access credit the older you are, the larger your household size and if you owned a house. You are more likely to access credit (whether formal or informal) if you were a professional or in an administrative job and married. However, the farther away you live from a bank, the less <b>likely</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> access credit but surprisingly the more <b>likely</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> access credit if you live farther away from a market. On the effects of access to credit on the consumption pattern of households, the results showed that households with access to credit improve on their consumption pattern by consuming more non-food items. The results suggest that there is need to address key factors that inhibit access to credit by micro-economic units that would facilitate economic growth and development.

40|$|Imagine {{that you}} are {{entering}} an unknown field {{and would like to}} estimate the productivity of the unfamiliar soil. You may pick up a handful of soil to evaluate its color and texture. You also can feel {{how difficult it is to}} break a clod apart, roll it into a ball or press out a ribbon. After repeating this procedure at different field locations, soil depths and times, you get a feeling of both spatial and temporal soil variability. Some of this variability can explain the non-uniformity of crop yield. If you collect soil samples and send them to a soil-testing laboratory, you can get a standardized measure of soil nutrient levels and other characteristics. The greater the sampling density, the more <b>likely</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> obtain a good representation of the variability of soil properties across the field. This process, however, takes time and money, both when sampling and in the lab, and limits the number of soil samples which can be justified economically...|$|E

40|$|The {{answer is}} that probabilities allow you to use logic and {{continue}} to reason even {{in the presence of}} uncertainty. Statistics lets you figure out how <b>likely</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> be wrong: this lets you keep quiet when you are likely to make a fool of yourself and to speak with authority when you have strong evidence on your side. Consider the ancient example of deductive logic: Proof 1. All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore Socrates is mortal. Fine and good, but are we sure that Socrates was a man? Isn’t there just the teeniest chance that he was a cross-dressing woman or a alien xeno-anthropologist doing some fieldwork? Do we know that all men are mortal? Some of us aren’t dead yet after all, so we are not proven to be mortal. Other than simply ignoring such quibbles and pretending that you didn’t hear them, what option do you have? Classical logic leaves you with this: Proof 2. Some men are mortal. Socrates may be a man. Therefore Socrates may be mortal. which is not completely satisfactory, because the exact same logic applies to this: Proof 3. Some men are bald. Socrates may be a man.
