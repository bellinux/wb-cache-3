40|$|Abstract. Data stream {{processing}} {{has become increasingly}} important as many emerging applications call for sophisticated realtime processing over data streams, such as stock trading surveillance, network traffic monitoring, and sensor data analysis. Stream joins {{are among the most}} important {{stream processing}} operations, which can be used to detect linkages and correlations between different data streams. One major challenge in processing stream joins is to handle continuous, high-volume, and time-varying data streams under resource constraints. In this paper, we present a novel <b>load</b> <b>diffusion</b> system to enable scalable execution of resource-intensive stream joins using an ensemble of server hosts. The <b>load</b> <b>diffusion</b> is achieved by a simple correlation-aware stream partition algorithm. Different from previous work, the <b>load</b> <b>diffusion</b> system can (1) achieve fine-grained load sharing in the distributed stream processing system; and (2) produce exact query answers without missing any join results or generate duplicate join results. Our experimental results show that the <b>load</b> <b>diffusion</b> scheme can greatly improve the system throughput and achieve more balanced load distribution. ...|$|E

We report a proof-of-concept study on a reagentless optical biosensing platform that circumvents the problems usually associated with direct glucose detection by utilizing the UV-VIS absorption properties of polyaniline, a biocompatible polymer.

Different from DMFCs with active fuel feeding systems, passive DMFCs with nearly stagnant fuel and air tend to bear comparatively less power densities. A steady state, one-dimensional, multi-component and thermal model is described {{and applied to}} simulate the operation of a passive direct methanol fuel cell. The model takes into consideration the thermal and mass transfer effects, along with the electrochemical reactions occurring in the passive DMFC. The model {{can be used to}} predict the methanol, oxygen and water concentration profiles in the anode, cathode and membrane as well as to estimate the methanol and water crossover and the temperature profile across the cell. Polarization curves are numerically simulated and successfully compared with experiments for different methanol feed concentrations. The model predicts with accuracy the influence of the methanol feed concentration on the cell performance and the correct trends of the current density and methanol feed concentration, on methanol and water crossover. The model is rapidly implemented and is therefore suitable for inclusion in real-time system level DMFC calculations.

40|$|Based on the {{investigation}} of mid-span local boundary layer suction and positive bowed cascade, a coupled local tailored boundary layer suction and positive bowed blade method is developed to improve {{the performance of a}} highly <b>loaded</b> <b>diffusion</b> cascade with less suction slot. The effectiveness of the coupled method under different inlet boundary layers is also investigated. Results show that mid-span local boundary layer suction can effectively remove trailing edge separation, but deteriorate the flow fields near the endwall. The positive bowed cascade is beneficial for reducing open corner separation, but is detrimental to mid-span flow fields. The coupled method can further improve the performance and flow field of the cascade. The mid-span trailing edge separation and open corner separation are eliminated. Compared with linear cascade with suction, the coupled method reduces overall loss of the cascade by 31. 4 % at most. The mid-span loss of the cascade decreases as the suction coefficient increases, but increases as bow angle increases. The endwall loss increases as the suction coefficient increases. By contrast, the endwall loss decreases significantly as the bow angle increases. The endwall loss of coupled controlled cascade is higher than that of bowed cascade with the same bow angle because of the spanwise inverse “C” shaped static pressure distribution. Under different inlet boundary layer conditions, the coupled method can also improve the cascade effectively...|$|R
40|$|Study Design: An in vivo {{study of}} the effects of {{mechanical}} loading on transport of small solutes into normal human lumbar intervertebral discs (IVD) using serial postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Objective: To investigate the influence of a sustained mechanical <b>load</b> on <b>diffusion</b> of small solutes {{in and out of the}} normal IVD. Summary of Background Data: Diffusion is an important source of disc nutrition and the in vivo effects of <b>load</b> on <b>diffusion</b> in human IVD remains unknown. Methods: Forty normal lumbar discs (on MRI) in 8 healthy volunteers were subjected to serial post contrast (Gadoteridol) 3 Tesla MRI in 2 phases. In phase 1 (control), volunteers were scanned at different time points – precontrast and 1. 5, 3, 4. 5, 6, and 7. 5 hours postcontrast injection. In phase 2, 1 month later, the same volunteers were subjected to sustained supine loading for 4. 5 hours. MRI scans were performed precontrast (preload) and postcontrast (postloading) at 1. 5, 3, and 4. 5 hours. Their spines were then unloaded and recovery scans performed at 6 and 7. 5 hours postcontrast. In house software was used to analyze images. Results: Repeated-measures ANOVA and pairwise comparisons at different time points in the central region of the loaded disc (LD) compared to the unloaded discs (UD) revealed significantly lower signal intensity ratios (P 1. 5 h:P 3 h:P 4. 5 h< 0. 001 :< 0. 001 :< 0. 002) indicating reduction in transport rates for the LDs. Signal intensity ratios continued to rise in LD for 3 hours into recovery phase,whereas UD at the same time point showed a decrease (mean ± SD = 0. 08 ± 0. 08 vs. - 0. 21 ± 0. 03). Conclusion: Sustained supine creep loading (50 % body weight) for 4. 5 hours retards transport of small solutes into the center of human IVD and it required 3 hours of accelerated diffusion in recovery state for LD to catch-up with diffusion in UD. The study supports the theory that sustained mechanical <b>loading</b> impairs <b>diffusion</b> of nutrients entering the disc and quite possibly accelerates disc degeneration.

It was found that FU has a larger apparent diffusion coefficient than that of DMFU, and the diffusion of the latter was more hindered. The result of ^(19) F spin diffusion NMR for the corresponding freeze-dried samples indicates that a larger portion of DMFU resided in the R_f core/IPDU intermediate-layer region (where IPDU refers to isophorone diurethane, as a linker to interconnect the R_f group and the PEG chain) than that of FU while {{the opposite is true}} in the PEG–water phase. To understand the experimental data, a diffusion model was proposed to include: (1) hindered diffusion of the drug molecules in the R_f core/IPDU-intermediate-layer region; (2) relatively free diffusion of the drug molecules in the PEG-water phase (or region); and (3) diffusive exchange of the probe molecules between the above two regions.

40|$|AbstractWe {{analyze the}} {{response}} of nonlinear viscoelastic biodegradable polymers when subject to mechanical loading coupled with the diffusion of a fluid (water) through the polymers and the degradation that occurs {{over a period of}} time. We consider the quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model introduced by Fung (1981) that {{has been found to be}} reasonably good in modeling tissues undergoing moderate deformations for modeling the nonlinear viscoelastic response of the biodegradable polymer that is being studied, i. e., poly-lactic acid (PLLA). We modify the QLV model to incorporate changes in the material parameters that are a consequence of the degradation that the polymers undergo. We assume that the rate of degradation increases with an increase in the magnitude of strains and concentration of water. We also assume that the degradation softens the polymers and that the rate of stress relaxation (or the rate of creep) of the polymer increases with degradation. Our primary intention is to examine the effect of viscoelasticity on the degradation in virtue of the time-dependent response of such bodies, and also due to the effect of the diffusion of water that leads to degradation. The problem leads to three different time histories associated with the strong coupling between the mechanical <b>loading,</b> <b>diffusion</b> of a fluid (water), and the degradation.
