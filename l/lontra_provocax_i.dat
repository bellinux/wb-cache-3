50|$|Neotropical otters have an {{interesting}} phylogenic relationship to other otter species. They are most similar to Lontra feline and <b>Lontra</b> <b>provocax,</b> which is not surprising considering these two species are found in South America. However, neotropical otters are relatively distantly related to Pteronura brasiliensis, which is surprising considering they have nearly identical ecological niches and home ranges.|$|R
5000|$|The {{southern}} {{river otter}} (<b>Lontra</b> <b>provocax)</b> is a species of otter that lives in Chile and Argentina. Although called a [...] "river otter", it inhabits both marine and freshwater environments. It sometimes is considered a subspecies of Lontra canadensis. The {{southern river otter}} is listed as endangered, due to illegal hunting, water pollution, and habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|The Magellanic subpolar {{forests are}} home to the {{southern}} pudú, the world's smallest deer, which stands only 35-45 cm (14-18 inches) high at the shoulder. Other animal species include the cougar (Puma concolor) and the endangered southern river otter (<b>Lontra</b> <b>provocax).</b> Endemic rodents include the Patagonian rat, the mole mouse, and the viscacha, a small rodent that looks almost like a rabbit with a long, bushy tail.|$|R
50|$|The fauna of the Andean Patagonian forest {{region is}} very varied with many endemic species. Predatory mammals include the cougar (Felis concolor), the culpeo (Lycalopex culpaeus), the {{southern}} river otter (<b>Lontra</b> <b>provocax)</b> and the Geoffroy's cat (Leopardus geoffroyi). Other mammals include Humboldt's hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus humboldtii), the Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum), the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the south Andean deer (Hippocamelus bisulcus) and numerous species of rodents.|$|R
50|$|Three {{native species}} of {{carnivores}} of the Mustelidae group inhabit the Park. One is Molina's hog-nosed skunk, Conepatus chinga; {{the second is}} lesser grison, Galictis cuja; the third is southern river otter, <b>Lontra</b> <b>provocax,</b> an endangered species. An introduced mustelid: American mink, Mustela vison, has wrought havoc in the Parks ecosystems. The impact of mink has been devastating for bird species nesting {{on the ground and}} on floating reeds.|$|R
50|$|Common mammals include {{screaming}} {{hairy armadillo}} (Chaetophractus vellerosus), pink fairy armadillo (Chlamyphorus truncatus), cougar (Puma concolor), South American gray fox (Lycalopex griseus), Patagonian weasel (Lyncodon patagonicus), guanaco (Lama guanicoe), southern mountain cavy (Microcavia australis), mara (Dolichotinae subfamily). Vulnerable or endangered mammals include plains viscacha rat (Tympanoctomys barrerae), pink fairy armadillo (Chlamyphorus truncatus), strong tuco-tuco (Ctenomys validus), viscacha rat (Octomys mimax), Roig's pericote (Andalgalomys roigi), delicate salt flat mouse (Salinomys delicatus) and Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum).Endangered mammals include {{southern river otter}} (<b>Lontra</b> <b>provocax).</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{good food}} {{sources for the}} Patagonian otter (<b>Lontra</b> <b>provocax),</b> the Galaxias platei and the Aegla alacalufi {{may have played a}} part in {{sustaining}} this aquatic mammal during this glacial period. Today, this otter is found throughout Southern Chile and is found as far north as 39˚S. During the LGM, most of its habitat was covered by ice. DNA testing of L. provocax in the Patagonian area has shown potential embedded refugia in the southern coastal region, with intertidal crustaceans in addition to other embedded aquatic life as possible food sources.|$|R
50|$|Animals include river otters (Lontra longicaudis), {{southern}} Andean huemuls (Hippocamelus bisulcus), pudus (small deer), foxes, cougars, guanacos and maras. Huillin (<b>Lontra</b> <b>provocax),</b> {{an endangered}} native otter, {{has been reported}} in the park. Birds reported include Magellanic woodpeckers, green austral parakeets, geese, ducks, swans, blue-eyed cormorants, Andean condors (Vultur gryphus) and green-backed firecrowns (Saphonoides sephaniodes). Amphibian fauna reported are Hylorina sylvatica and Bufo spinolosus. Five genera and 32 species of Simuliidae (black fly) have been recorded. These genera are Cnesia, Cnesiamima, Gigantodax, Paraustrasimulium, and Simulium (Pternaspatha), a subgenus of Simulium with 19 species; these account for 57% of the Simuliidae fauna found in Argentina.|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} spatial differences composition {{between different}} water bodies in diet of {{southern river otter}} (<b>Lontra</b> <b>provocax,</b> Thomas, 1908) from 196 scats collected between years 2003 - 2006 during surveys in freshwater environments in south of Chile (39 ° and 40 S and 71. 5 ° and 73 ° W). For the whole study area, crustaceans from two genera (Samastacus sp. and Aegla sp.) were the otter’s main food category, representing almost 100 % frequency of occurrence of the consumed preys. Fish {{can be considered as}} secondary item in a general approximation to otter diet. Predation upon others vertebrates (amphibians, birds and mammals) and invertebrate (mussels and insects) were rather rare in the diet of the otter, while no reptiles were observed. We described occurrence, frequency of occurrence and quantity of prey items to compare the otter diet between freshwater habitats (rivers, streams and lakes). We discuss implications of our results and compare it with similar diet studies on the species...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{processes}} that affect freshwater ecosystems at the watershed level is fundamental for the conservation and management of river otters. During 2 consecutive years, we surveyed the occurrence of the Southern river otter <b>Lontra</b> <b>provocax</b> and its main prey (crustaceans) in a watershed of 9900 km 2 in the Chilean temperate forest. We modeled predator and prey distributions {{with a variety of}} statistical techniques by relating a set of environmental predictors to species occurrence records. Otter and crustaceans were associated with areas of intermediate to low human disturbance with a mosaic of riparian vegetation densities, mainly at low altitudes. The singularity of the Andean Range, with a very marked elevation gradient and oligotrophic watercourses in the higher areas, created more vulnerable conditions for otter presence because prey abundances were limited in those areas. Human impacts affected otter populations at a landscape scale through the presence of main roads, as these were mostly located in lower parts of the watershed where otters have their primary habitat. These results point to the importance of land management and protection of low-elevation areas where otters still occur to ensure the long-term viability of its freshwater populations...|$|R
30|$|The {{hypothesis}} of vicariance events {{caused by the}} Andes supports the genetic distances reported by Trinca et al. (2012), who found large genetic distances between the phylogenetic groups of South America {{and those of the}} Western Andes, where genetic distances are greater between populations of L. longicaudis than with its sister species, <b>Lontra</b> <b>provocax.</b> This separation also corresponds to a subspecies division: L. longicaudis annectens is distributed throughout the Western Andes and L. longicaudis enudris is distributed throughout the Eastern Andes (Larivière 1999). The effect of population separation by the Andes mountain range has also been reported for other vertebrate species including some South American fish (Hubert et al. 2007) and bats belonging to the genus Artibeus (Larsen et al. 2007), where the elevation of the Andes prevents gene flow and has resulted in different species {{on each side of the}} mountain range. The results of the present study offer morphological information that concurs with the molecular data from Trinca et al. (2012) on the separation of populations of the Eastern and Western Andes. This indicates that sufficient time has passed for both the morphological and the genetic divergence of the populations of L. longicaudis on both sides of the mountain range.|$|R
40|$|Otters are {{considered}} as top predators {{and participate in}} ecosystem services and affect community structure by the modulation of prey densities. Nevertheless, diet of the southern river otter (<b>Lontra</b> <b>provocax)</b> has been described only based on the frequency of occurrence of prey in feces. Actually, the relationship between trophic availability and prey selection is unknown. In this study we evaluated the relationship between prey selection and availability in different environments. We hypothesized that this species is an opportunistic predator, and that their diet could be determined by prey abundance. We studied fecal remains in two different environments (marsh–river) in the “Carlos Andwanter Nature Sanctuary” in southern Chile. The prey found in the scats were identified through reference collections. We estimated the frequency of occurrence, relative availability of prey item, and the Selection Index. In addition, we quantified prey availability using electrofishing. Our {{results suggest that the}} trophic niche for L. provocax is restricted to a few prey items, with crayfish (Samastacus spinifrons) as the most important diet component. However, L. provocax consume specific crayfish size independently of their availability in the environment. Our results suggest that L. provocax is an opportunistic predator, but shows a clear selection of medium-sized crayfish...|$|R
40|$|The {{southern}} {{river otter}} (<b>Lontra</b> <b>provocax)</b> {{is one of the}} four South American otter species and is considered as Endangered by the IUCN with probably the smallest distribution of any otter in the world. The objective of the present study is to describe and assess the use of the reversible ketamine-medetomidine-atipamezole anesthetic combination in {{southern river otter}}s. Between January and April 2004, four anesthetic procedures (two captures and two surgeries) were performed in three different individuals in cooperation with the River Otters of Chile Project, for radiotransmitter implantation purposes. Anesthesia consisted in ketamine 6 mg/kg (SD ± 2. 8) and medetomidine 48 μg/kg (SD ± 10) i. m., reversed with atipamezole 263 μg/kg (SD ± 99) i. m. Initial effect time, latency period and reversal time were recorded. Anesthetic parameters (sonorous stimuli answer, pedal reflex, jaw relaxation and general attitude) and physiologic parameters (rectal temperature, cardiac and respiratory rate, capillary refill time and relative oxyhemoglobin saturation), were monitored at 5 -min intervals for 30 min. Anesthetic induction was rapid and smooth with a successful antagonism by atipamezole. Decrease of rectal temperature reached 36. 3 ºC (SD ± 0. 5) at 30 -min post-anesthetic administration. Cardiac rate was depressed with a mean of 85 beats/min (SD ± 22) and relative oxyhemoglobin saturation (two anesthetic procedures) had an average of 87 % (SD ± 12). The anesthetic quality was classified as excellent, based on the anesthetic parameters. Finally, the anesthesia was effective and can be recommended for the capture and surgical radiotransmitter placement on wild L. provocax individuals. However, caution must be taken with possible bradycardia and hypothermia states...|$|R
