5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|Still {{photographs}} of Oheka Castle in Huntington, New York, {{were used in}} the opening montage, representing Kane's Xanadu estate. Ferguson also designed statues from Kane's collection with styles ranging from Greek to German Gothic. The sets were also built to accommodate Toland's camera movements. Walls were built to fold and furniture could quickly be moved. The film's famous ceilings were made out of muslin fabric and camera boxes were built into the floors for <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> shots. Welles later said that he was proud that the film production value looked much more expensive than the film's budget. Although neither worked with Welles again, Toland and Ferguson collaborated in several films in the 1940s.|$|E

5|$|Although {{observations}} of living goblin sharks are scant, its anatomy suggests its lifestyle is inactive and sluggish. Its skeleton is reduced and poorly calcified, the muscle blocks along its sides (myomeres) are weakly developed, and its fins {{are soft and}} small. Its long caudal fin, held at a <b>low</b> <b>angle,</b> is also typical of a slow-swimming shark. The long snout {{appears to have a}} sensory function, as it bears numerous ampullae of Lorenzini that can detect the weak electric fields produced by other animals. Due to the snout's softness, it is unlikely to be used for stirring up prey from the bottom as has been proposed. Vision seems to be less important than other senses, considering the relatively small optic tectum in the shark's brain. Yet unlike most deep-sea sharks, it can change the size of its pupils, thus probably does use its sight in some situations. Goblin sharks may fall prey to the blue shark (Prionace glauca). Parasites documented from this species include the copepod Echthrogaleus mitsukurinae, and the tapeworms Litobothrium amsichensis and Marsupiobothrium gobelinus.|$|E
5|$|He {{converted}} from a starting pitcher to a reliever in 2009, {{along with several}} other Phillies pitching prospects. Around that time, he also, {{at the suggestion of}} the same minor league pitching coaches who converted him to relief, lowered his release point to his current <b>low</b> <b>angle.</b> Success did not manifest itself immediately, as he still posted a 4.04 ERA in 2009, his first season in relief, but in 2010, he cut his ERA to 2.91 while splitting time between Lakewood and the Clearwater Threshers, the Phillies High-A affiliate. At the end of the 2010 season, he played for the Mesa Solar Sox in the Arizona Fall League. He spent the 2011 season with the Double-A Reading Phillies, accruing a 0–1 record and a 3.05 ERA and 3 saves in 53 games. Thereafter, the Phillies added him to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.|$|E

60|$|Measuring <b>low</b> <b>angles</b> by reflexion.--an {{ordinary}} {{artificial horizon}} is useless for very <b>low</b> <b>angles.</b> They {{can be measured}} to within two or three minutes, {{by means of a}} vertical point of reference obtained in the following manner:--Tie two pieces of thread, crossing each other at two feet above the ground, put the vessel of mercury underneath it, and look down upon the mercury. When the eye is so placed, that the crossed threads exactly cover their reflexion, the line of sight is truly vertical; and, if the distant object be brought down to them by the sextant, the angle read off will be 90 degrees + altitude. Captain George's arrangement of glass floating on mercury (made by Cary, Fleet Street, London), allows of very <b>low</b> <b>angles</b> being observed, but the use of this instrument requires considerable caution as to the purity of the mercury and the cleanliness of the glass.|$|R

The ship had a crew of 60 officers and men.|$|E

40|$|Sea finding {{behaviour}} in hatchling {{sea turtles}} {{is widely believed}} to be guided by orientation towards the brightest horizon and away from high silhouettes. We propose that the horizon profile at the <b>lowest</b> <b>angle</b> of elevation is a more important cue for ocean finding than light intensity. Examples of hatchling orientation occurring at natural nest sites, at preselected beach release sites, and within a walled wooden arena under various conditions in the field, are presented. We conclude that hatchlings orient as follows: (1) Hatchlings move towards the horizon line at the <b>lowest</b> <b>angle</b> of elevation; (2) Hatchlings move away from high silhouettes, {{in a direction that}} remains close to the horizon line at the <b>lowest</b> <b>angle</b> of elevation; (3) Should a conflict exist regarding the direction of lowest horizon elevation, hatchlings move towards the brightest lowest horizon. This refinement to current theory explains numerous instances of natural non-ocean-finding behaviour in marine turtles, which occur both by day and by night, {{and in the absence of}} artificial lighting. We propose that the disruption caused to hatchling orientation by artificial lighting close to nesting beaches occurs because bright lights mask the horizon line as a cue by making it impossible to discern, causing the hatchlings to move towards the only visible "horizon" — the artificial lights. Consequently, we recommend that managers of sea turtle rookeries where turtles have an ocean-finding problem should manipulate the beach profile to ensure the direction of the ocean matches the <b>lowest</b> <b>angle</b> of elevation, in combination with light reduction strategies — as the most effective means of preventing disrupted orientation...|$|R

25|$|The Brandt Mle CM60A1, {{also known}} as the Brandt HB 60LP, MCB-60 HB, or simply as the Brandt 60mm LP Gun-Mortar, is a 60mm (2.36 in.) gun-mortar. Unlike {{conventional}} infantry mortars, it was not designed to be mounted on a bipod and a baseplate, but rather in the turrets of armoured fighting vehicles. The CM60A1 could be fired at a very <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> of elevation, giving it the dual purpose of direct fire artillery. Its hydraulic recoil mechanism reduces peak loads, allowing it to be mounted in very light armoured cars such as the Panhard AML-60 or wheeled armoured personnel carriers like the Panhard M3.|$|E
25|$|The Nicobar Islands are {{a series}} of {{volcanic}} islands that are part of an active volcanic arc, formed above the subduction zone where the Indo-Australian Plate passes beneath the Burma Plate.

Most of the strike-slip component of the convergence is accommodated by the Great Sumatran fault, which passes northwards into the Andaman Sea spreading centre.
