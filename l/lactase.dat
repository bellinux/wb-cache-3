5|$|An enzyme's name {{is often}} derived from its {{substrate}} or the chemical reaction it catalyzes, {{with the word}} ending in -ase. Examples are <b>lactase,</b> alcohol dehydrogenase and DNA polymerase. Different enzymes that catalyze the same chemical reaction are called isozymes.|$|E
5|$|Lactose is the {{naturally}} occurring sugar found in milk. A molecule of lactose is {{formed by the}} combination of a molecule of galactose with a molecule of glucose. It is broken down when consumed into its constituent parts by the enzyme <b>lactase</b> during digestion. Children have this enzyme but some adults no longer form it and they are unable to digest lactose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lactase</b> {{persistence}} is the phenotype {{associated with}} various autosomal dominant alleles prolonging {{the activity of}} <b>lactase</b> beyond infancy; conversely, <b>lactase</b> nonpersistence is the phenotype associated with primary <b>lactase</b> deficiency. Among mammals, <b>lactase</b> persistence is unique to humans— it evolved relatively recently (in the last 10,000 years) among some populations, {{and the majority of}} people worldwide remain <b>lactase</b> nonpersistent. For this reason, <b>lactase</b> persistence is of some interest to the fields of anthropology, human genetics, and archaeology, which typically use the genetically derived persistence/non-persistence terminology.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{congenital}} alactasia, {{also called}} congenital <b>lactase</b> deficiency, {{is an extremely}} rare, autosomal recessive enzyme defect that prevents <b>lactase</b> expression from birth. People with congenital <b>lactase</b> deficiency cannot digest lactose from birth, so cannot digest breast milk. This genetic defect {{is characterized by a}} complete lack of <b>lactase</b> (alactasia). About 40 cases have been reported worldwide, mainly limited to Finland. Before the 20th century, babies born with congenital <b>lactase</b> deficiency often did not survive, but death rates decreased with soybean-derived infant formulas and manufactured lactose-free dairy products.|$|E
25|$|Primary hypolactasia, or primary <b>lactase</b> deficiency, is genetic, only affects adults, and {{is caused}} by the absence of a <b>lactase</b> {{persistence}} allele. In individuals without the <b>lactase</b> persistence allele, less <b>lactase</b> is produced by the body over time, leading to hypolactasia in adulthood. The frequency of <b>lactase</b> persistence, which allows lactose tolerance, varies enormously worldwide, with the highest prevalence in Northwestern Europe, declines across southern Europe and the Middle East and is low in Asia and most of Africa, although it is common in pastoralist populations from Africa.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} is to {{determine}} whether it is due to primary <b>lactase</b> deficiency or an underlying disease that causes secondary <b>lactase</b> deficiency. Physicians should investigate the presence of undiagnosed coeliac disease, Crohn disease, or other enteropathies when secondary <b>lactase</b> deficiency is suspected and an infectious gastroenteritis has been ruled out.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lactase</b> (also {{known as}} lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, or LPH), {{a part of}} the β-galactosidase family of enzymes, is a {{glycoside}} hydrolase involved in the hydrolysis of the disaccharide lactose into constituent galactose and glucose monomers. <b>Lactase</b> is present predominantly along the brush border membrane of the differentiated enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine. In humans, <b>lactase</b> is encoded by the LCT gene.|$|E
25|$|Secondary hypolactasia or {{secondary}} <b>lactase</b> deficiency, also called acquired hypolactasia or acquired <b>lactase</b> deficiency, {{is caused by}} an injury to the small intestine. This form of lactose intolerance can occur in both infants and <b>lactase</b> persistent adults and is generally reversible. It {{may be caused by}} acute gastroenteritis, coeliac disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, chemotherapy, intestinal parasites (such as giardia), or other environmental causes.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} people with lactose {{intolerance}} is unknown. Some human populations have developed <b>lactase</b> persistence, in which <b>lactase</b> production continues into adulthood probably {{as a response to the}} benefits of being able to digest milk from farm animals. The percentage of the population that has a decrease in <b>lactase</b> as they age is less than 10% in Northern Europe and as high as 95% in parts of Asia and Africa.|$|E
25|$|Lactose {{intolerance}} {{does not}} cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract. There are four types: primary, secondary, developmental, and congenital. Primary lactose intolerance is when the amount of <b>lactase</b> decline as people age. Secondary lactose intolerance is due to injury to the small intestine such as from infection, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or other diseases. Developmental lactose intolerance may occur in premature babies and usually improves over {{a short period of}} time. Congenital lactose intolerance is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which little or no <b>lactase</b> is made from birth. When lactose intolerance is due to secondary <b>lactase</b> deficiency, treatment of the underlying disease allows <b>lactase</b> activity to return to normal levels. Lactose intolerance is different from a milk allergy.|$|E
25|$|When lactose {{intolerance}} {{is due to}} secondary <b>lactase</b> deficiency, treatment of the underlying disease may allow <b>lactase</b> activity to return to normal levels. In people with coeliac disease, {{lactose intolerance}} normally reverts or improves several months after starting a gluten-free diet, but temporary dietary restriction of lactose may be needed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lactase</b> {{supplements}} {{are sometimes}} {{used to treat}} lactose intolerance.|$|E
25|$|People {{with primary}} <b>lactase</b> {{deficiency}} cannot modify their body’s {{ability to produce}} <b>lactase.</b> In societies where lactose intolerance is the norm, it is not considered a condition that requires treatment. However, where dairy is a larger component of the normal diet, a number of efforts may be useful. There are four general principles in dealing with lactose intolerance: avoidance of dietary lactose, substitution to maintain nutrient intake, regulation of calcium intake, and use of enzyme substitute. Regular consumption of dairy food by <b>lactase</b> deficient individuals may also reduce symptoms of intolerance by promoting colonic bacteria adaptation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lactase</b> also catalyzes the {{conversion}} of phlorizin to phloretin and glucose.|$|E
25|$|Most mammals {{normally}} {{cease to}} produce <b>lactase</b> and become lactose intolerant, after weaning.|$|E
25|$|The optimum {{temperature}} for human <b>lactase</b> is about 37°C for its activity {{and has an}} optimum pH of 6.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{analysis}} shows <b>lactase</b> persistence has developed {{several times in}} different places independently in an example of convergent evolution.|$|E
25|$|When lactose {{avoidance}} is not possible, or on {{occasions when}} a person chooses to consume such items, then enzymatic <b>lactase</b> supplements may be used.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lactase</b> is {{also used}} to screen for blue white colonies in the {{multiple}} cloning sites of various plasmid vectors in Escherichia coli or other bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Metabolic food {{reactions}} {{are due to}} inborn or acquired errors of metabolism of nutrients, such as in diabetes mellitus, <b>lactase</b> deficiency, phenylketonuria and favism.|$|E
25|$|Different alleles for <b>lactase</b> {{persistence}} {{have developed}} {{at least three}} times in East African populations, with persistence extending from 26% in Tanzania to 88% in the Beja pastoralist population in Sudan.|$|E
25|$|The primary way of {{managing}} the symptoms of lactose intolerance is to limit the intake of lactose to a level that can be tolerated. <b>Lactase</b> deficient individuals vary {{in the amount of}} lactose they can tolerate, and some report that their tolerance varies over time, depending on health status and pregnancy. However, as a rule of thumb, people with primary <b>lactase</b> deficiency and no small intestine injury are usually able to consume at least 12 grams of lactose per sitting without symptoms, or with only mild symptoms, with greater amounts tolerated if consumed with a meal or throughout the day.|$|E
25|$|Lactose {{intolerance}} generally develops {{later in}} life, but can present in young patients in severe cases. It {{is due to}} an enzyme deficiency (<b>lactase)</b> and not allergy, and occurs in many non-Western people.|$|E
25|$|The {{diarrhoea}} {{is caused}} by multiple activities of the virus. Malabsorption occurs because {{of the destruction of}} gut cells called enterocytes. The toxic rotavirus protein NSP4 induces age- and calcium ion-dependent chloride secretion, disrupts SGLT1 transporter-mediated reabsorption of water, apparently reduces activity of brush-border membrane disaccharidases, and possibly activates the calcium ion-dependent secretory reflexes of the enteric nervous system. Healthy enterocytes secrete <b>lactase</b> into the small intestine; milk intolerance due to <b>lactase</b> deficiency is a symptom of rotavirus infection, which can persist for weeks. A recurrence of mild diarrhoea often follows the reintroduction of milk into the child's diet, due to bacterial fermentation of the disaccharide lactose in the gut.|$|E
25|$|Food {{intolerance}} are {{all other}} adverse reactions to food. Subgroups include enzymatic (e.g. lactose intolerance due to <b>lactase</b> deficiency), pharmacological (e.g. reactions against biogenic amines, histamine intolerance), and undefined food intolerance (e.g. against some food additives).|$|E
25|$|Lactose, the {{disaccharide}} sugar {{component of}} all milk, must be cleaved {{in the small}} intestine by the enzyme <b>lactase,</b> in order for its constituents, galactose and glucose, to be absorbed. Lactose intolerance is {{a condition in which}} people have symptoms due to not enough of the enzyme <b>lactase</b> in the small intestines. Those affected vary in the amount of lactose they can tolerate before symptoms develop. These may include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and nausea. Severity depends on the amount a person eats or drinks. Those affected are usually able to drink at least one cup of milk without developing significant symptoms, with greater amounts tolerated if drunk with a meal or throughout the day.|$|E
25|$|Probiotics {{reduce the}} {{duration}} of symptoms by one day and reduced the chances of symptoms lasting longer than four days by 60%. The probiotic lactobacillus can help prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults but possibly not children. For those with lactose intolerance, taking digestive enzymes containing <b>lactase</b> when consuming dairy products often improves symptoms.|$|E
25|$|When two monosaccharides undergo {{dehydration}} synthesis whereby {{a molecule}} {{of water is}} released, as two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom are lost from the two monosaccharides, the new molecule, consisting of two monosaccharides, is called a disaccharide and is conjoined together by a glycosidic or ether bond. The reverse reaction can also occur, using a molecule of water to split up a disaccharide and break the glycosidic bond; this is termed hydrolysis. The most well-known disaccharide is sucrose, ordinary sugar (in scientific contexts, called table sugar or cane sugar to differentiate it from other sugars). Sucrose consists of a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule joined together. Another important disaccharide is lactose, consisting of a glucose molecule and a galactose molecule. As most humans age, the production of <b>lactase,</b> the enzyme that hydrolyzes lactose back into glucose and galactose, typically decreases. This results in <b>lactase</b> deficiency, also called lactose intolerance.|$|E
25|$|In many cultures, {{especially}} in the West, humans continue to consume milk beyond infancy, using the milk of other mammals (especially cattle, goats and sheep) as a food product. Initially, the ability to digest milk was limited to children as adults did not produce <b>lactase,</b> an enzyme necessary for digesting the lactose in milk. People therefore converted milk to curd, cheese and other products to reduce the levels of lactose. Thousands of years ago, a chance mutation spread in human populations in Europe that enabled the production of <b>lactase</b> in adulthood. This mutation allowed milk {{to be used as}} a new source of nutrition which could sustain populations when other food sources failed. People process milk into a variety of products such as cream, butter, yogurt, kefir, ice cream, and cheese. Modern industrial processes use milk to produce casein, whey protein, lactose, condensed milk, powdered milk, and many other food-additives and industrial products.|$|E
25|$|A {{deficiency}} in digestive enzymes {{can also cause}} some types of food intolerances. Lactose intolerance {{is a result of}} the body not producing sufficient <b>lactase</b> to digest the lactose in milk; dairy foods which are lower in lactose, such as cheese, are less likely to trigger a reaction in this case. Another carbohydrate intolerance caused by enzyme deficiency is hereditary fructose intolerance.|$|E
25|$|While {{essentially}} the same process as normal intestinal lactose digestion, direct treatment of milk employs a different variety of industrially produced <b>lactase.</b> This enzyme, produced by yeast from the genus Kluyveromyces, takes much longer to act, must be thoroughly mixed throughout the product, and is destroyed by even mildly acidic environments. Its main use is in producing the lactose-free or lactose-reduced dairy products sold in supermarkets.|$|E
25|$|Lactose-free {{milk can}} be {{produced}} by passing milk over <b>lactase</b> enzyme bound to an inert carrier. Once the molecule is cleaved, there are no lactose ill effects. Forms are available with reduced amounts of lactose (typically 30% of normal), and alternatively with nearly 0%. The only noticeable difference from regular milk is a slightly sweeter taste due to the generation of glucose by lactose cleavage. It does not, however, contain more glucose, and is nutritionally identical to regular milk.|$|E
25|$|Digestive enzyme {{supplements}} may {{significantly reduce}} the amount of flatulence caused by some components of foods not being digested by the body and thereby promoting the action of microbes in the small and large intestines. It has been suggested that alpha-galactosidase enzymes, which can digest certain complex sugars, are effective in reducing the volume and frequency of flatus. The enzymes alpha-galactosidase, <b>lactase,</b> amylase, lipase, protease, cellulase, glucoamylase, invertase, malt diastase, pectinase, and bromelain are available, either individually or in combination blends, in commercial products.|$|E
25|$|Protein {{purification}} {{is either}} preparative or analytical. Preparative purifications aim {{to produce a}} relatively large quantity of purified proteins for subsequent use. Examples include the preparation of commercial products such as enzymes (e.g. <b>lactase),</b> nutritional proteins (e.g. soy protein isolate), and certain biopharmaceuticals (e.g. insulin). Analytical purification produces a relatively small amount of a protein {{for a variety of}} research or analytical purposes, including identification, quantification, and studies of the protein's structure, post-translational modifications and function. Pepsin and urease were the first proteins purified {{to the point that they}} could be crystallized.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{variations}} for <b>lactase</b> {{persistence and}} greater height {{came with the}} Yamna people. The derived allele of the KITLG gene (SNP rs12821256) {{that is associated with}} – and likely causal for – blond hair in Europeans is found in populations with Eastern but not Western Hunter Gatherer ancestry, suggesting that its origin is in the Ancient North Eurasian (ANE) population and may have been spread in Europe by individuals with Steppe ancestry. Consistent with this, the earliest known individual with the derived allele is a ANE individual from the Late Upper Paleolithic Afontova Gora archaeological complex.|$|E
25|$|Genetic tests may {{be useful}} in {{assessing}} whether a person has primary lactose intolerance. <b>Lactase</b> activity persistence in adults is associated with two polymorphisms: C/T 13910 and G/A 22018 located in the MCM6 gene. These polymorphisms may be detected by molecular biology techniques at the DNA extracted from blood or saliva samples; genetic kits specific for this diagnosis are available. The procedure consists of extracting and amplifying DNA from the sample, following with a hybridation protocol in a strip. Colored bands are obtained as final result, and depending on the different combination, {{it would be possible to}} determine whether the patient is lactose intolerant. This test allows a noninvasive definitive diagnostic.|$|E
