The analysis covers 298 communities for the period 2003 - 2007. Consistent with evidence found elsewhere, we find that these base adjustments have only a marginal impact on the local community in which the bases are <b>located.</b> <b>Armed</b> forces, Base closure, Defense drawdown, Demand shock, Geographic information system, Regional adjustment,...|$|R
