5|$|Alkan's {{compositions}} for organ {{have been}} among the <b>last</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works to be brought back to the repertoire.

His wife {{of more than}} forty years, who had struggled with an illness that had kept her an invalid for months, died on February 6, 1888. The younger Amelia died the following year after a brief malady. Despite his weakening eyesight and a fear that he was becoming antiquated, Holmes continued to find solace in writing.

5|$|Smith's salary rose to over $1.4 million, but he {{followed}} his 1988 {{season with a}} mediocre 1989, finishing with his worst ERA in five years. For the seventh consecutive season, his number of innings pitched decreased or remained the same. However, he compiled 12.23 strikeouts per nine innings, nearly two higher than any other season of his career.

5|$|The Scottish Symphony (Symphony No. 3 in A minor) {{was written}} and revised {{intermittently}} between 1829 (when Mendelssohn noted down the opening theme {{during a visit}} to Holyrood Palace) and 1842, when it was given its premiere in Leipzig, the <b>last</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> symphonies to be performed in public. This piece evokes Scotland's atmosphere in the ethos of Romanticism, but does not employ any identified Scottish folk melodies.|$|E

It was his second comedy, and his third work based on a Shakespeare play, following Macbeth and Otello. The plot revolves around the thwarted, sometimes farcical, efforts of the fat knight, Sir John Falstaff, to seduce two married women {{to gain access to}} their husbands' wealth.|$|E
5|$|Wagner was {{to spend}} the next twelve years in exile from Germany. He had {{completed}} Lohengrin, the <b>last</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> middle-period operas, before the Dresden uprising, and now wrote desperately to his friend Franz Liszt to have it staged in his absence. Liszt conducted the premiere in Weimar in August 1850.|$|E
5|$|As Preneuse {{had gone}} ashore near Port Louis, Sercey {{had come to}} observe the {{engagement}} and therefore witnessed {{the destruction of the}} <b>last</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> squadron of 1796. A commander without a command he subsequently took ship back to France and there retired from his commission, later returning to his family and settling on Île de France. The action temporarily left the French with no naval forces in the East Indies at all, although raiding cruises by privateers still posed a considerable threat to the British Indian Ocean trade routes. The only subsequent reinforcement to arrive in the region during the war was the frigate Chiffone was intercepted and captured at the Battle of Mahé shortly after arrival in 1801, although substantial reinforcements did reach Île de France before the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803.|$|E

5|$|Bligh {{hoped to}} find water and food on Tofua, then proceed to the nearby island of Tongatapu to seek help from King Poulaho (whom he knew from his visit with Cook) in {{provisioning}} the boat for a voyage to the Dutch East Indies. Ashore at Tofua, there were encounters with natives who were initially friendly but grew more menacing as time passed. On 2 May, four days after landing, Bligh realised that an attack was imminent. He directed his men back to the sea, shortly before the Tofuans seized the launch's stern rope and attempted to drag it ashore. Bligh coolly shepherded the <b>last</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shore party and their supplies into the boat. In an attempt to free the rope from its captors, the quartermaster John Norton leapt into the water; he was immediately set upon and stoned to death.|$|E
5|$|Candide, the baron, Pangloss, Martin, and Cacambo {{arrive at}} {{the banks of the}} Propontis, where they rejoin Cunégonde and the old woman. Cunégonde has indeed become hideously ugly, but Candide {{nevertheless}} buys their freedom and marries Cunégonde to spite her brother, who forbids Cunégonde from marrying anyone but a baron of the Empire (he is secretly sold back into slavery). Paquette and Brother Giroflée—having squandered their three thousand piastres—are reconciled with Candide on a small farm (une petite métairie) which he just bought with the <b>last</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> finances.|$|E
5|$|Clara {{volunteers to}} speak to Skaldak to try and calm him, {{relaying}} the Doctor's words to Skaldak, though {{he knows that the}} Doctor is listening. The Doctor informs Skaldak he was encased in the ice for 5000 years. Skaldak laments the loss of his daughter and his people; however, the Doctor tries to comfort him with the knowledge that the Ice Warriors still live, just not on Earth or Mars. Skaldak escapes from his armour - an act of great dishonour - and stops broadcasting the signal to the other Ice Warriors because he believes himself to be the only one of his kind left. The Doctor surmises that, thinking himself to be the <b>last</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> kind, Skaldak has nothing left to lose. He manages to grab and kill three members of the crew.|$|E

5|$|During {{his life}} and those of his sons, Constantine was {{presented}} as a paragon of virtue. Pagans such as Praxagoras of Athens and Libanius showered him with praise. When the <b>last</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sons died in 361, however, his nephew (and son-in-law) Julian the Apostate wrote the satire Symposium, or the Saturnalia, which denigrated Constantine, calling him inferior to the great pagan emperors, and given over to luxury and greed. Following Julian, Eunapius began—and Zosimus continued—a historiographic tradition that blamed Constantine for weakening the Empire through his indulgence to the Christians.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s Notosusanto wrote extensively, {{focusing}} on essays but also writing poems and, later, short stories; the <b>last</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> creative works were written around 1956. He published four short story anthologies between 1958 and 1963. The first, Hudjan Kepagian (Morning Rain), consisted of six short stories. It {{dealt with the}} struggle against the Dutch colonists during the revolution. His second anthology, Tiga Kota (Three Cities), was published the following year and followed events in three cities: Rembang, Yogyakarta, and Jakarta. The others, and his numerous stories which were published outside of anthologies, mostly dealt with {{the war and the}} positive effects of revolution.|$|E
5|$|England's {{most recent}} inductees into the IRB Hall are 19th-century internationals Alfred St. George Hamersley and Robert Seddon, both {{inducted}} in 2013. Hamersley played for England in the first-ever rugby union international against Scotland in 1871, and captained England in the <b>last</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> four appearances in 1874. He {{went on to}} play significant roles in the early development of the sport in both New Zealand and Canada. Seddon, capped three times for England in 1887, was most notable as {{the captain of the}} unofficial British side that toured Australia and New Zealand in 1888; he died in a boating accident during the tour. This venture proved to be the genesis of the modern British and Irish Lions. The touring team was also inducted alongside Seddon.|$|E
