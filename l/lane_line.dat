50|$|Drafting is used {{to reduce}} wind {{resistance}} and is seen most commonly in bicycle racing, car racing, and speedskating, though drafting is occasionally used even in cross-country skiing, downhill skateboarding, and running. Some forms of triathlon allow drafting. Drafting occurs in swimming as well: both in open-water races (occurring in natural bodies of water) and in traditional races in competition pools. In a competition pool a swimmer may hug the <b>lane</b> <b>line</b> that separates them from the swimmer they are abaft of thereby {{taking advantage of the}} liquid slipstream in the other swimmer's wake. Drafting also occurs in competitive longboarding.|$|E

Occasionally, there may be a median strip separating lanes of opposing traffic.

50|$|An {{expansion}} of the tramway network was prepared by laying more tracks. A comprehensive system could, however, not be developed until the leases of the Bradford Tramways and Omnibus Company and of the Bradford and Shelf Tramway Company expired. The Corporation obtained therefore statutory powers to terminate the Companies leases before their expiry date, and purchased them on 1st February 1902, after which date both tramway companies went into liquidation. Some of the steam engines and cars from the former tramway companies were hired until the electric system was fully operational. The horse trams on the Manningham <b>Lane</b> <b>line</b> were retired on 31 January 1902. In 1903 steam services on the former Bradford and Shelf Tramway lines ceased, and the Bradford tramway system became fully electrified.|$|E

However he was disqualified an hour after the race for a lane violation. American Wallace Spearmon, who had initially placed third, was disqualified moments after the race for having stepped on his inside <b>lane</b> <b>line</b> during the race. The American coaches appealed the decision and upon viewing footage of Spearmon's offence they noticed that Martina had committed the same infraction. They dropped their appeal for Spearmon in favour of a successful protest against Martina. As a result of the disqualifications, Shawn Crawford and Walter Dix, both of the United States, were promoted to silver and bronze respectively.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} method for {{monitoring}} {{the position of a}} vehicle on a lane. Cameras are mounted on the sides of vehicle and focus downwards on the road to capture images containing the <b>lane</b> <b>lines</b> and wheels/vehicle boundaries. The Hough transform (HT) is employed to detect the lane from the captured images. The correlation of sequential images and the constraints of <b>lane</b> <b>lines</b> and cameras are used to minimize the region of interest (RoI) in both image space and HT space, which increases the capture accuracy and decrease the computation complexity. The lane position monitoring system is assumed to be useful for unmanned vehicles, and can also provide warmings in normal vehicles to enhance driving safety. The experiments show the method is effective on various roads and driving situations...|$|R

50|$|To keep Nyad {{swimming}} in a straight line, her specially designed, slow-moving catamaran support boat deployed a 10 ft streamer: a long pole keeps the streamer several yards away from the boat, and the streamer is designed to remain about 5 feet underwater, so that Nyad can swim above it, much like following a <b>lane</b> <b>line</b> in a swimming pool. At night, the white streamer {{was replaced by a}} string of red LED lights. Writing in her blog in July 2011, Nyad stated that the development of the submerged guide streamer, in early summer 2011, may be the single greatest aid to her marathon swim. In all of her previous swims, she had trouble keeping the support boat in sight and was prone to veer off-course. Keeping a boat headed in a straight line, in the ocean, while moving at only 1 to 2 knots is very difficult, and her catamaran is equipped with thrusters and a special sea anchor (in case of following seas) to stabilize its course.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Land-based mobile mapping {{systems have}} yielded an {{enormous}} time saving in capturing road networks and their surrounding. However, the manual extraction {{of the road}} information from the mobile mapping data is still a time-consuming task. This paper presents ARVEE (Automated Road Geometry Vectors Extraction Engine), a robust automatic road geometry extraction system developed by Absolute Mapping Solution Inc. (AMS). The extracted road information includes 3 D continuous lane lines, road edges as well as lane lines attributes. There are three innovations in this work. First, all the visible lane lines in the georeferenced image sequences are extracted, instead of only extracting the central <b>lane</b> <b>line</b> or the nearby <b>lane</b> <b>line</b> pair. Second, <b>lane</b> <b>line</b> attributes are recognized, so the output is a functional description of the road geometry. Third, the output is an absolute-georeferenced model of lane lines in mapping coordinates, and is directly compatible to GIS databases. ARVEE includes four steps: First, extracting linear features in each image. Second, extracting, filtering and grouping linear features into <b>lane</b> <b>line</b> segments (LLS) based on their geometric and radiometric characteristics. Third, linking the LLSs into long lane lines 3 D model using Multiple-Hypothesis Analysis (MHA). Finally, classifying each <b>lane</b> <b>line</b> into a <b>lane</b> <b>line</b> type based on the synthetic analysis of the included LLSs ’ features. The system has been tested on large number of VISAT ™ mobile mapping data. The experiments on massive real MMS data sets demonstrate that ARVEE can deliver accurate and robust 3 D continuous functional road geometry model. Full automatic processing result from ARVEE can replace most of the human efforts in road geometry modelling. 1...|$|E
