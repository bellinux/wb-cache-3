40|$|<b>Lifeboat</b> {{is one of}} {{important}} parts of the ship where without <b>lifeboat,</b> the ship not allowed to sail. Nowadays there were many problems on <b>lifeboat</b> releasing and handling system that involve injuries and fatalities, <b>lifeboat</b> should save people live but unfortunately <b>lifeboat</b> were cause loss of live on board ship during <b>lifeboat</b> operation. This study objective {{is to examine the}} factor and problem of <b>lifeboat</b> releasing operation. The factor, problem and activity were been highlight as the reference and guidelines for seafarer to prevent accident and problem during <b>lifeboat</b> operation. Several way and recommendation to minimize the problem is stated based on the factor determined. The factors have been examine are the design of <b>lifeboat</b> releasing system, maintenance of <b>lifeboat</b> and the training drill of <b>lifeboat</b> for this study and each relation was analysis by descriptive and qualitative in SPSS software. The mean and Pearson correlation tool were used to analysis the factor in this study.

5|$|There {{was also}} much {{speculation}} {{at the time}} in the Adelaide and Melbourne press on why the <b>lifeboats</b> had not been launched earlier. Survivor James Fitzgerald pointed out in his recollection that, had the <b>lifeboats</b> been filled to capacity, no one would have survived the severe weather conditions experienced. He also commented that passenger vessels were not required to carry enough <b>lifeboats,</b> concluding that there were insufficient places for all Gothenburgs passengers and crew. It was not until RMS Titanic sank some 37 years later in 1912, that it was made compulsory for all British registered ships to carry sufficient <b>lifeboats</b> for everyone on board.|$|E
5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is {{too large}} to dock in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried {{to and from the}} ship in tenders, which can be used as <b>lifeboats</b> in an emergency.

5|$|The storm made {{launching}} the <b>lifeboats</b> almost impossible. At about 3:00am, Captain Pearce ordered the two port <b>lifeboats</b> lowered, each with four crew on board. While being passed astern {{one of the}} boats broke the painter and became adrift. Her crew tried hard to {{pull up to the}} ship's side, but it was impossible in the heavy squall.

5|$|Titanic had a {{total of}} 20 <b>lifeboats,</b> {{comprising}} 16wooden boats on davits, 8 {{on either side of}} the ship, and 4 collapsible boats with wooden bottoms and canvas sides. The collapsibles were stored upside down with the sides folded in, and would have to be erected and moved to the davits for launching. Two were stored under the wooden boats and the other two were lashed atop the officers' quarters. The position of the latter would make them extremely difficult to launch, as they weighed several tons each and had to be manhandled down to the boat deck. On average, the <b>lifeboats</b> could take up to 68 people each, and collectively they could accommodate 1,178– barely half the number of people on board and a third of the number the ship was licensed to carry. The shortage of <b>lifeboats</b> was not because of a lack of space nor because of cost. Titanic had been designed to accommodate up to 68lifeboats– enough for everyone on board– and the price of an extra 32lifeboats would only have been some , a tiny fraction of the $7.5 million that the company had spent on Titanic. In an emergency, <b>lifeboats</b> at the time were intended to be used to transfer passengers off the distressed ship and onto a nearby vessel. It was therefore commonplace for liners to have far fewer <b>lifeboats</b> than needed to accommodate all their passengers and crew, and of the 39British liners of the time of over , 33 had too few lifeboat places to accommodate everyone on board. The White Star Line desired the ship to have a wide promenade deck with uninterrupted views of the sea, which would have been obstructed by a continuous row of <b>lifeboats.</b>|$|E

5|$|All-weather <b>lifeboats</b> (ALBs) {{are large}} boats with {{enclosed}} wheelhouses and survivor spaces below deck, which are self-righting and {{can go out}} in all weather conditions.

5|$|At about 06:00 on 9 October 1913, , a Royal Line ship under {{charter to}} the Uranium Line, caught {{fire in a}} gale on the North Atlantic. The crew fought the fire for about two hours, but, realizing the {{severity}} of the fire and the limited options for dousing it in the high seas, Captain Francis Inch of Volturno had his wireless operator send out SOS signals. The westbound Kroonland, already beyond Volturnos location, turned east to aid the burning liner.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the sinking, public inquiries were set up in Britain and the United States. The US inquiry began on 19April under the chairmanship of Senator William Alden Smith, while the British inquiry commenced in London under Lord Mersey on 2May 1912. They reached broadly similar conclusions: the regulations on the number of <b>lifeboats</b> that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate; Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings; the <b>lifeboats</b> had not been properly filled or crewed; and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a danger area at too high a speed. Captain Lord of Californian was strongly criticised by both inquiries for failing to render assistance to Titanic.|$|E
