The effects of air and LPG flow rates and flow ratio, flame temperature and flame shape on the synthesized titania nanoparticles were investigated. Experimental investigation showed that the mean particle size of TiO 2 increased obviously with increasing airflow rate, and not obviously with that of LPG, the mean particle size at optimal experimental condition was less than 20 nm, the rutile fraction in the synthesized powder increased with increasing flame temperature and the particle size was affected by the flame height. A particle-dynamic model, describing the nucleation and coagulation of titania monomers/nanoparticles, was used {{to account for the}} experimental results based on the isothermal assumption. Generally speaking, the calculated particle sizes from the particle dynamics were consist with the experimental measurements, especially, when the feed concentration of TiCl 4 was low.

This article also represents the results of theoretical calculations and experimental research of basic metrological characteristics of a flame ionization detector (FID) : conversion function, sensitivity, threshold sensitivity, linear range conversion tracking, quantity of background current, and level of fluctuating noise. During experimental research it was studied influence of mode?s changes on value of outgoing signal. Researches which were made allowed to choose optimal operation mode for flame ionization detector. Also it allowed to indicate level of dynamical errors, which can occur due to unstable gas?s consumption. ? ?????? ???????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ????????????? ? ????????? ???. ????????? ???????????? ????????????? ???????????????, ?????????????????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ???????? ??????? ?????? ? ??????????? ???????. ? ??????????? ?? ??????? ? ????? ????????, ????????? ????????? ?????? ???????? ???????, ? ?????? ?????????? ???????????????? ???????? ?????????????? ? ????????-????????????? ?????. ???????????? ?????????? ????????????? ???????? ? ????????????????? ???????????? ???????? ??????????????? ????????????? ????????-?????????????? ?????????

30|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} a pricing competition problem in some special competing supply chains in which differentiated but substitutable products are sold {{into the same}} market. These competing supply chains often consist {{of only a few}} upstream manufacturers, each of which distributes its products through exclusive downstream outlets who usually carry only one product line. This exclusive dealership is not uncommon in industries like petrol, automobiles, some electronic products, softdrinks, fastfoods, and so on. For instance, a <b>petrol</b> <b>gas</b> station often retails gasolines from some certain oil producer, and a 4 S store usually carries some certain car brand or cars from a specific manufacturer. For convenience, we use “manufacturer” to represent the upstream firm and “retailer” to the downstream channel participant in the following discussion.|$|R

40|$|Historically, {{gasoline}} and diesel {{have been used}} as vehicle fuels for a long time. But the decline of oil supply and unstable oil price drive people to find alternative energy for vehicle fuel. Alternative energy solutions may shift energy consumption to less carbon, less pollutions and provide more energy diversity. These issues are investigated in the present literature review.   The first part of the thesis introduces different kinds of alternative energy for vehicles, such as biofuel, natural <b>gas,</b> hydrogen, liquefied <b>petrol</b> <b>gas,</b> electricity and compressed air. The presentations includes their utilization, production, environment effect, running performance, fuel property, market share, running and investigate cost and production barriers. The second part of the thesis work compares the properties of the alternative fuels and discusses the advantages and drawbacks of different types of fuel energies.   Compared with traditional fuels, alternative fuels have superiority in environment impact, sustainability and energy efficiency. Some of them have been used in reality and show a potential as future fuels. The author found that natural <b>gas</b> and liquefied <b>petrol</b> <b>gas</b> have low running costs, better environment performance and acceptable running range, and thus are able to substitute conventional fuels in the short term. Biofuel has better sustainability than gasoline. It will probably become more sustainable and cost effective in the mid-term period. Electricity can also become a future fuel in mid-term period since it has excellent emission performance and low running costs. Hydrogen is expected to substitute conversional fuels in the long term due to high investment costs and current unsustainable production pathway of the latter. The compressed air turned out not suitable for substituting conventional fuels because of poor efficiency and running range performance...|$|R
