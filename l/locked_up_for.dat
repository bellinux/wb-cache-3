5|$|Jacqui meets divorcee Tony and an {{attraction}} igniting, they have sex. Tony goes away on holiday and starts {{a relationship with}} Jacqui on his return. Jacqui violates her prison tag after staying at Tony's house overnight so she is sent back to prison. Sadly, Tony is forced to dump her because he cannot handle the pressure. Jacqui befriends Becca Dean (Ali Bastian) but Becca is killed by another prisoner and Jacqui is devastated. Jacqui decides {{to make something of}} herself, not wanting to waste her life and is reunited with Tony and Davey returns with the favour. He forces Jacqui to marry Aleksander Malota (Jon Lolis). Jacqui and Aleksander manage to convince an immigration officer that their romance is genuine and they are married but Jacqui continues her affair with Tony secretly. The family uncover the truth about the marriage when Carmel and Alek's affair is revealed. Jacqui admits she married Alek to pay off her debt to Davey and is seeing Tony. Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) is furious and orders Jacqui, Alek and Carmel to leave the house. Jacqui announces her pregnancy; Tony initially doesn't want the child, fearing that it may die like his previous child and their dreams are shattered when Jacqui miscarries and is left unable to have children of her own. Tony attacks Alek violently as he blames Alek as he cannot grieve for his baby publicly. Tony announces to the people in The Dog that the baby was his, not Alek's and Jacqui asks Alek to return to Albania so she can live her life and he agrees. Carmel is shocked to discover Alek is leaving, leaving Carmel devastated. Depressed, Jacqui returns to her old habit of shop lifting, so Neville Ashworth (Jim Millea) gets her <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the night.|$|E

This was on a Friday afternoon, and the office had been <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the weekend. With a verbal agreement in place, they agreed to meet on Monday morning to complete the transfer officially. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, hearing about the move, phoned Keane and asked whether he would like to join them instead of Blackburn. Ferguson ensured they had the paperwork ready and met up with Keane on the Saturday and signed for Manchester United for £3.75million, a British transfer record at the time.|$|E

25|$|While Duntov was {{developing}} an innovative new chassis for the 1963 Corvette, designers were adapting and refining the basic {{look of the}} racing Sting Ray for the production model. A fully functional space buck (a wooden mock-up created to work out interior dimensions) was completed by early 1960, production coupe styling was <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the most part by April, and the interior, instrument panel included was in place by November. Only {{in the fall of}} 1960 did the designers turn their creative attention to {{a new version of the}} traditional Corvette convertible and, still later, its detachable hardtop. For the first time in the Corvette's history, wind tunnel testing helped refine the final shape, as did practical matters like interior space, windshield curvatures, and tooling limitations. Both body styles were extensively evaluated as production-ready 3/8-scale models at the Caltech wind tunnel.|$|E
25|$|The detective {{enters and}} talks with Serena {{and her friends}} about the murders of Crown and Robbins. They deny {{knowledge}} of Crown's murder, frustrating the detective. Needing a witness for the coroner's inquest, he next questions an apprehensive Porgy. Once Porgy admits to knowing Crown, he is ordered to come and identify Crown's body. Sportin' Life tells Porgy that corpses bleed {{in the presence of}} their murderers, and the detective will use this to hang Porgy. Porgy refuses to identify the body, but is dragged off anyway. Bess is distraught, and Sportin' Life puts his plan into action. He tells her that Porgy will be <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> a long time, and points out that he is the only one still here. He offers her happy dust, and though she refuses, he forces it on her. After she takes a whiff, he paints a seductive picture of her life with him in New York ("There's a boat dat's leavin' soon for New York"). She regains her strength and rushes inside, slamming the door on his face, but he leaves a packet of happy dust on her doorstep, and settles down to wait.|$|E

2500|$|In 1950, {{his studies}} were briefly {{interrupted}} by political interferences. He and writer Jan Trefulka were {{expelled from the}} party for [...] "anti-party activities." [...] Trefulka described the incident in his novella Pršelo jim štěstí (Happiness Rained On Them, 1962). [...] Kundera also used the incident as an inspiration for the main theme of his novel Žert (The Joke, 1967). After Kundera graduated in 1952, the Film Faculty appointed him a lecturer in world literature. In 1956 Milan Kundera was readmitted into the Party. He was expelled {{for the second time}} in 1970. Kundera, along with other reform communist writers such as Pavel Kohout, was partly involved in the 1968 Prague Spring. This brief period of reformist activities was crushed by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. Kundera remained committed to reforming Czech communism, and argued vehemently in print with fellow Czech writer Václav Havel, saying, essentially, that everyone should remain calm and that [...] "nobody is being <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> his opinions yet," [...] and [...] "the significance of the Prague Autumn may ultimately be greater than that of the Prague Spring." [...] Finally, however, Kundera relinquished his reformist dreams and moved to France in 1975. He taught for a few years in the University of Rennes. He was stripped of Czechoslovak citizenship in 1979; he has been a French citizen since 1981.|$|E
2500|$|In their {{court papers}} on September 14, 2012 {{government}} lawyers said the plaintiffs had no basis to fear being <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> their activities, {{and that the}} judge's order interfered with the president's powers {{at a time of}} war. Government attorneys argue that the executive branch is entitled to latitude when it comes to cases of national security and that the law is neither too broad nor overly vague. Judge Forrest's opinion is [...] "unprecedented, and the government has compelling arguments that it should be reversed," [...] prosecutors said. They called the permanent injunction an [...] "extraordinary injunction of worldwide scope." [...] Lawyers for the Obama administration also argued that the United States will be irreparably harmed if it has to abide by a judge's ruling that it can no longer hold terrorism suspects indefinitely without trial in military custody. The government said that the injunction was an [...] "unprecedented" [...] trespass on power of the president and the legislature that by its very nature was doing irreparable harm. They also argued that the injunction places an undue burden on military commanders {{in a time of war}} while the plaintiffs had no reasonable fear of ever being detained [...] "in the foreseeable future." [...] The Court's injunction against application of section 1021 'in any manner, as to any person,'... combined with its mistaken view that section 1021 goes beyond reaffirming the authority contained in the AUMF, could impose entirely unjustified burdens on military officials worldwide, complicating the ability to carry out an armed conflict authorized by Congress in the public interest... Given the absence of any risk of impending harm to plaintiffs, the serious injury to the government and the public interest in the invalidation of a statute enacted by public representatives, and the possible effect on an ongoing armed conflict and the Executive's prerogatives in military affairs, a stay is necessary.|$|E

2500|$|The {{programming}} of {{the artificial}} intelligence for Elizabeth {{was considered a}} major technical challenge for Irrational, as they desired to give her as much near-human behavior in contrast to most other games where such companions are either highly scripted or given relatively simplistic pragmas to follow, and had little previous examples from other games to build on; Levine cited Half-Life 2s Alyx as the last [...] "great AI companion". Irrational had previously developed AI routines for the Big Daddies and Little Sisters in BioShock {{that would allow them}} to roam and interact with the environment if otherwise left alone by the player; these routines were the basis of building out improved behavior for Elizabeth. The developers had spent much time improving these routines to give Elizabeth her own tendencies to look and move around as a real actor instead of a robotic non-player character, as to re-enforce her central role to the player. To this, Levine explained that they looked to the banter between the main characters in the Uncharted series by Naughty Dog. [...] Levine praised the work that Naughty Dog had done, and felt he would be able to create the same with a more somber period piece. Some of Elizabeth's responses will be driven by a player's action (such as the aforementioned horse recovery scene), but other times, Elizabeth's actions will be on her own in response to the environment. Much of Columbia was seeded [...] "room by room" [...] with elements that Elizabeth will be interested in, comment on, and react to. However, as for the player not missing these elements, such actions would only be performed based on a number of factors, including whether the player was near and looking at Elizabeth, and the current tension of the game. This apparent curiosity serendipitously worked with Elizabeth's story, who after having been <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> twelve years would be eager to see new things. Elizabeth's AI also monitors and tracks the player's behavior over time, such that the AI will attempt to predict when the player is moving and keep Elizabeth out of the line of fire. Programming Elizabeth's AI was a significant challenge to the Irrational team, and at several points during development the suggestion of cutting her from the game was brought up. Levine countered these suggestions, insisting on keeping her in the game. To manage this, a multidisciplinary subgroup called the [...] "Liz Squad" [...] reviewed the levels designed by others to assure that the presence of Elizabeth was accounted for across the game and to avoid situations where the level would delegate the character to simply hiding in a closet. On March 15, 2013, the full voice cast was announced by Irrational Games.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Forage cereals {{offer the}} {{potential}} {{to increase the amount}} of forage grown and consumed on dairy farms in southern Australia. The effect of single or multiple grazing of winter cereal forages by lactating dairy cattle on dry matter (DM) yield and nutritive value at grazing and on subsequent silage production harvested at the soft-dough stage of growth was determined in three studies in south-western Victoria. In the first two studies, a range of forage cereals and an annual ryegrass were grazed either once (G 1) during tillering (GS 21 – 29), followed by <b>locking</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> silage, grazed twice (G 2) (GS 21 – 29 and GS 32 – 34), followed by <b>locking</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> silage, or not grazed (NG) and harvested for silage only. In the third study, two forage cerealswere either ungrazed (NG) or grazed at eitherGS 21,GS 24,GS 30 orGS 32 and subsequently <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> and harvested <b>for</b> silage. All silage harvests occurred at GS 84 (soft dough). In all studies, grazing at early tillering resulted inDMyieldof less than 1. 4 tDM/ha, although crudeprotein (CP) (30 – 37 %DM) andestimatedmetabolisable energy (ME) (12. 2 – 14 MJ/kg DM) were high. Deferring grazing until the start of stem elongation resulted in higher DM yields (1. 8 – 4. 3 t DM/ha). Silage DM yields were higher (P < 0. 05) for G 1 and NG treatments than for G 2 in all cases apart from McKellarwheat in study 1. At silageharvest,CPandestimatedMEcontents of cerealswere lower than for annual ryegrass. In general, total DM yields across the growing season were higher for the G 1 and NG treatments compared with forages that were grazed twice before silage harvest. Deferment of a single grazing from early tillering to stem elongation did not adversely affect total DMproduction. However, delaying grazing until stem elongation resulted in significant declines in C...|$|R
