40|$|Numerous {{animal and}} human {{studies have shown}} that afferent {{information}} from the periphery contributes to the control of walking. In particular, recent studies have consistently shown that <b>load</b> <b>receptor</b> input is an important element of the locomotion control mechanism. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the contribution of <b>load</b> <b>receptor</b> feedback to the compensatory stretch reflex response. We examined the contribution of <b>load</b> <b>receptor</b> feedback to the magnitude of the short and medium latency components of the ankle plantar flexor stretch reflex responses following an unexpected dorsiflexion perturbation during human walking. Three body load conditions were investigated: normal body load, a 30 % increase in body load, and a 30 % decrease in body load. Healthy subjects walked on a treadmill at approximately 3. 6 km/h with the left ankle attached to a portable stretching device. Dorsiflexion perturbations (8 degrees; 350 - 425 degrees/s) were generated during the late stance phase of gate (approximately 400 ms following heel contact). Electromyographic activity was recorded from the soleus, tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, rectus femoris, and biceps femoris muscles using bipolar surface electrodes. Stretch reflex responses were observed in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles for all of the body load conditions; however, increasing or decreasing the body load did not affect the timing and magnitude of the responses. This study provides evidence that <b>load</b> <b>receptor</b> input does not contribute strongly to the corrective response of the stretch reflex in the plantar flexor muscles during walking...|$|E
40|$|A basic {{aspect of}} the {{neuronal}} control of quadrupedal locomotion of cat and of bipedal stance and gait of humans concerns the antigravity function of leg extensors. In humans proprioceptive reflexes involved in the maintenance of body equilibrium depend {{on the presence of}} contact forces opposing gravity. Extensor load receptors are thought to signal changes of the projection of body's centre of mass with respect to the feet. According to observations in the cat, this afferent input probably arises from Golgi tendon organs and represents a newly discovered function of these receptors in the regulation of stance and gait. From these experiments it can be concluded that during locomotion there is a closing of Ib inhibitory and an opening of Ib extensor facilitatory paths. In humans evidence for a significant contribution of <b>load</b> <b>receptor</b> contribution to the leg muscle activation came from immersion experiments. Compensatory leg muscle activation depends on the actual body weight. Also during gait the strength of leg extensor activation during the stance phase is load dependent. In patients with Parkinson's disease there is a reduced load sensitivity and decreased leg extensor activation, which might contribute to the movement disorder. Recent experiments in paraplegic patients show that the beneficial effects of a locomotor training critically depends on the initial degree of body unloading and reloading {{during the course of the}} training period. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} several years, {{evidence}} has arisen that the neuronal control of human locomotion depends on feedback from load receptors. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the effects and the course of sudden and unexpected changes in body load (vertical perturbations) on leg muscle activity patterns during walking on a treadmill. Twenty-two healthy subjects walking with 25 % body weight support (BWS) were repetitively and randomly loaded to 5 % or unloaded to 45 % BWS during left mid-stance. At the new level of BWS, the subjects performed 3 - 11 steps before returning to 25 % BWS (base level). EMG activity of upper and lower leg muscles was recorded from both sides. The bilateral leg muscle activity pattern changed following perturbations in the lower leg muscles and the net effect of the vertical perturbations showed onset latencies with a range of 90 - 105 ms. Body loading enhanced while unloading diminished the magnitude of ipsilateral extensor EMG amplitude, compared to walking at base level. Contralateral leg flexor burst activity was shortened following loading and prolonged following unloading perturbation while flexor EMG amplitude was unchanged. A general decrease in EMG amplitudes occurred during the course of the experiment. This is assumed to be due to adaptation. Only the muscles directly activated by the perturbations did not significantly change EMG amplitude. This is assumed to be due to the required compensation of the perturbations by polysynaptic spinal reflexes released following the perturbations. The findings underline the importance of <b>load</b> <b>receptor</b> input for the control of locomotion...|$|E
40|$|How is <b>load</b> sensed by <b>receptors,</b> {{and how is}} this sensory {{information}} used to guide locomotion? Many insights in this domain have evolved from comparative studies since it has been realized that basic principles concerning load sensing and regulation {{can be found in}} a wide variety of animals, both vertebrate and invertebrate. Feedback about load is not only derived from specific <b>load</b> <b>receptors</b> but also from other types of receptors that previously were thought to have other functions. In the central nervous system of many species, a convergence is found between specific and nonspecific <b>load</b> <b>receptors.</b> Furthermore, feedback from <b>load</b> <b>receptors</b> onto central circuits involved in the generation of rhythmic locomotor output is commonly found. During the stance phase, afferent activity from various load detectors can activate the extensor part in such circuits, thereby providing reinforcing force feedback. At the same time, the flexion is suppressed. The functional role of this arrangement is that activity in antigravity muscles is promoted while the onset of the next flexion is delayed as long as the limb is loaded. This type of reinforcing force feedback is present during gait but absent in the immoble resting animal. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The startle reflex is an {{involuntary}} reaction to sudden sensory input {{and consists of}} a generalized flexion response. Startle responses in distal leg muscles occur more frequently during standing compared to sitting. We hypothesized that sensory input from <b>load</b> <b>receptors</b> modulates the occurrence of startle responses in leg muscles. METHODS: We administered sudden startling auditory stimuli (SAS) to 11 healthy subjects while (1) sitting relaxed, (2) standing relaxed, (3) standing while bearing 60 % of their weight on the right leg, (4) standing while bearing 60 % of their weight on the left leg, and (5) standing with 30 % body weight support ('bilateral unloaded'). The requested weight distribution for each condition was verified using force plates. Electromyography {{data were collected from}} both tibialis anterior (TA) and the left sternocleidomastoid muscles. RESULTS: In the TA, startle responses occurred much more frequently during normal standing (26 % of trials) compared to both sitting (6 % of trials, p< 0. 01) and bilateral unloading (3 % of trials, p< 0. 01). In the asymmetrical stance conditions, startle responses in the TA were more common in the loaded leg (21 % of trials) compared to the unloaded leg (10 % of trials, p< 0. 05). DISCUSSION: The occurrence of startle responses in the leg muscles was strongly influenced by load. Hence, it is likely that information from <b>load</b> <b>receptors</b> influences startle response activity. We suggest that, in a stationary position, startling stimuli result in a descending volley from brainstem circuits, which is gated at the spinal level by afferent input from <b>load</b> <b>receptors...</b>|$|R

Fluorescence increases reflected activation of receptor neuron populations converging onto individual glomeruli. We report several findings. First, five glomeruli were identifiable across animals {{based on their}} location and odorant responsiveness; all five showed complex response specificities. Second, maps of input were chemotopically organized at near-threshold concentrations but, at moderate concentrations, involved many widely distributed glomeruli. Third, the dynamic range of input to a glomerulus was greater than that reported for individual receptor neurons. Finally, odorant activation slopes could differ across glomeruli, and for different odorants activating the same glomerulus.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} load on the modulation of cutaneous reflexes, evoked by sural nerve stimulation, electromyographic activity in different leg muscles (tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius medialis (GM), biceps femoris, and soleus muscles (SO)) was recorded in healthy humans during treadmill walking with different body loads. Sural nerve stimulation was applied at two times perception threshold during different phases of the step cycle. Reflex amplitudes increased with body unloading and decreased with body loading. The reflex responses were not a simple function {{of the level of}} background activity. For example, in GM and SO, the largest reflex responses occurred during walking with body unloading, when background activity was decreased. Hence, stable ground conditions (body loading) yielded smaller reflexes. It is proposed that <b>load</b> <b>receptors</b> are involved in the regulation of cutaneous reflex responses in order to adapt the locomotor pattern to the environmental conditions. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if <b>load</b> <b>receptors</b> contribute to the afferent-mediated enhancement of ankle extensor muscle activity during the late stance phase of the step cycle. Plantar flexion perturbations were presented in late stance while able-bodied human subjects walked on a treadmill that was declined by 4 %, inclined by 4 % or held level. The plantar flexion perturbation produced a transient, but marked, presumably spinally mediated decrease in soleus EMG that varied directly with the treadmill inclination. Similarly, the magnitude of the control step soleus EMG and Achilles' tendon force also varied directly with the treadmill inclination. In contrast, the ankle angular displacement and velocity were inversely related to the treadmill inclination. These results suggest that Golgi tendon organ feedback, via the group Ib pathway, is reduced when the muscle-tendon complex is unloaded by a rapid plantar flexion perturbation in late stance phase. The changes in the unload response with treadmill inclination suggest that the late stance phase soleus activity may be enhanced by force feedback...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which macromolecules are selectively translocated through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is still essentially unresolved. Single molecule methods can provide unique information on topographic properties and kinetic processes of asynchronous supramolecular assemblies with excellent spatial and time resolution. Here, single-molecule far-field fluorescence microscopy {{was applied to the}} NPC of permeabilized cells. The nucleoporin Nup 358 could be localized at a distance of 70 nm from POM 121 -GFP along the NPC axis. Binding sites of NTF 2, the transport receptor of RanGDP, were observed in cytoplasmic filaments and central framework, but not nucleoplasmic filaments of the NPC. The dwell times of NTF 2 and transportin 1 at their NPC binding sites were 5. 8 +/- 0. 2 and 7. 1 +/- 0. 2 ms, respectively. Notably, the dwell times of these receptors were reduced upon binding to a specific transport substrate, suggesting that translocation is accelerated for <b>loaded</b> <b>receptor</b> molecules. Together with the known transport rates, our data suggest that nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs via multiple parallel pathways within single NPCs...|$|R
40|$|For the {{rehabilitation}} of neurological patients robot-aided gait training is increasingly being used. Lack of balance training in these robotic gait trainers might contribute {{to the fact that}} they do not live up to the expectations. Therefore, in this study we developed and evaluated an algorithm to support lateral balance during walking, through controlling pelvis motions. This algorithm assists the pelvis, according to a natural pelvic sway pattern, rather than attracting it to the middle of the treadmill. The support algorithm was tested on six healthy young subjects who walked on a treadmill, while different support gains were introduced. Using a higher support gain resulted in a closer approximation of the pelvic sway towards the reference pattern. Step width and step width variability reduced when the external stabilization was provided, and the stability margin increased. This indicates that artificial stabilization reduces the need for active lateral balance control. The presented algorithm to support lateral balance provides a way to assist balance in a more physiological way, compared to attracting the subject to the centre of the treadmill. Here the user is attracted/assisted towards a more natural weight shift pattern. This also facilitates a more natural input of the <b>load</b> <b>receptors,</b> which are largely involved in the regulation of muscle activation patterns and the transitions between the different gait phases...|$|R
40|$|We used knock-in mice that express green {{fluorescent}} protein (GFP) -labeled embryonic-type acetylcholine receptors {{to investigate}} postsynaptic responses to denervation of fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers, and to visualize the integration of newly synthesized GFP-labeled embryonic-type receptors into adult synapses. The embryonic-type receptors are transiently expressed and incorporated into the denervated endplates. They replaced synaptic adult-type receptors in a directed fashion, starting from the endplate's periphery and proceeding to its central regions. The progress of embryonic-type receptor expression with respect to transcriptional control is a transient, short-term activation mechanism. The less pronounced increase in the expression levels of the GFP-labeled receptors revealed a differential shift in the integration and degradation processes that constitute the dynamic equilibrium of the synaptic receptor pool.

40|$|It {{is known}} that after spinalization animals lose their ability to {{maintain}} lateral stability when standing or walking. A likely {{reason for this is}} a reduction of the postural limb reflexes (PLRs) driven by stretch and <b>load</b> <b>receptors</b> of the limbs. The aim {{of this study was to}} clarify whether spinal networks contribute to the generation of PLRs. For this purpose, first, PLRs were recorded in decerebrated rabbits before and after spinalization at T 12. Second, the effects of epidural electrical stimulation (EES) at L 7 on the limb reflexes were studied after spinalization. To evoke PLRs, the vertebrate column of the rabbit was fixed, whereas the hindlimbs were positioned on the platform. Periodic lateral tilts of the platform caused antiphase flexion–extension limbs movements, similar to those observed in intact animals keeping balance on the tilting platform. Before spinalization, these movements evoked PLRs: augmentation of extensor EMGs and increase of contact force during limb flexion, suggesting their stabilizing postural effects. Spinalization resulted in almost complete disappearance of PLRs. After EES, however, the PLRs reappeared and persisted for up to several minutes, although their values were reduced. The post-EES effects could be magnified by intrathecal application of quipazine (5 -HT agonist) at L 4 –L 6. Results of this study suggest that the spinal cord contains the neuronal networks underlying PLRs; they can contribute to the maintenance of lateral stability in intact subjects. In acute spinal animals, these networks can be activated by EES, suggesting that they are normally activated by a tonic supraspinal drive...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{differentiate}} the effects of body load and joint movements on the leg muscle activation pattern during assisted locomotion in spinal man. Stepping movements were induced by a driven gait orthosis (DGO) on a treadmill in patients with complete para‐/tetraplegia and, for comparison, in healthy subjects. All subjects were unloaded by 70 % of their body weight. EMG of upper and lower leg muscles and joint movements of the DGO of both legs were recorded. In the patients, normal stepping movements and those mainly restricted to the hips (blocked knees) were associated with a pattern of leg muscle EMG activity that corresponded to that of the healthy subjects, but the amplitude was smaller. Locomotor movements restricted to imposed ankle joint movements were followed by no, or only focal EMG responses in the stretched muscles. Unilateral locomotion in the patients was associated with a normal pattern of leg muscle EMG activity restricted to the moving side, while in the healthy subjects a bilateral activation occurred. This indicates that interlimb coordination depends on a supraspinal input. During locomotion with 100 % body unloading in healthy subjects and patients, no EMG activity was present. Thus, it can be concluded that afferent input from hip joints, in combination with that from <b>load</b> <b>receptors,</b> plays a crucial role in the generation of locomotor activity in the isolated human spinal cord. This is in line with observations from infant stepping experiments and experiments in cats. Afferent feedback from knee and ankle joints may be involved largely in the control of focal movement...|$|R
40|$|Peroxisomes compartmentalize {{a variety}} of {{important}} metabolic reactions including fatty acid β-oxidation and the related process of IBA β-oxidation. Peroxisomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and must be post-translationally imported. A dynamic import process is vital for proper matrix protein localization and {{is dependent on the}} family of peroxin (PEX) proteins. The delivery and peroxisomal import of cargo from a <b>loaded</b> <b>receptor,</b> PEX 5 or PEX 7, is carried out by the early-acting peroxins, including PEX 13 and PEX 14, and receptor recycling is carried out by the late-acting peroxins, including PEX 4 and PEX 6. In this thesis, I describe the use of double mutant analysis to differentiate early-acting and late-acting pex mutants by phenotypic and molecular analysis. I found that double mutants made with two early-acting or two late-acting pex mutants showed enhanced phenotypes in β-oxidation and import defects. In contrast, defects of double mutants made with a weak early-acting mutant and a late-acting mutant were suppressed. Additionally, I found that receptor localization is central to proper peroxisomal function. My results suggest that when the receptor is not removed from the peroxisome, stabilized peroxisomal pores may be formed, perhaps impairing peroxisomal function due to leaching of peroxisomal contents. Together my data suggest that balance between import and receptor recycling is fundamental for peroxisomal function. In humans, peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are most often caused by defects in late-acting peroxins. Peroxisomal defects occur in plants and humans {{as a result of the}} same lesions in PEX proteins. The understanding of how these late-acting defects can be ameliorated in plants, may inspire new approaches to human therapeutics...|$|R

By modifying FIDA for use in a two-dimensional system with quantal brightnesses, a method was developed to quantify the degree of clustering of the receptors on the cell surface. The analysis demonstrates that under physiological conditions, the EGF receptor exists in a complex equilibrium involving single molecules and clusters of two or more receptors. Acute depletion of cellular cholesterol enhanced EGF receptor clustering whereas cholesterol <b>loading</b> decreased <b>receptor</b> clustering, indicating that receptor aggregation is sensitive to the lipid composition of the membrane...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the mechanisms by which cultured central neurones from embryonic rat brain buffer intracellular Ca 2 + <b>loads</b> following kainate <b>receptor</b> activation using fluorescent indicators of [Ca 2 +]i and [Na+]i. Stimulation of cultured forebrain neurones with 100 μm kainate produced a rapid increase in [Ca 2 +]i that displayed a variable rate of recovery. Kainate also increased [Na+]i with a response that was slightly slower in onset and markedly slower in recovery. The recovery of [Ca 2 +]i to baseline was not very sensitive to the [Na+]i. The magnitude {{of the increase in}} [Na+]i in response to kainate did not correlate well with the [Ca 2 +]i recovery time, and experimental manipulations that altered [Na+]i did not have a large impact on the rate of recovery of [Ca 2 +]i. The recovery of [Ca 2 +]i to baseline was accelerated by the mitochondrial Na+-Ca 2 + exchange inhibitor CGP- 37157, suggesting that the recovery rate is influenced by release of Ca 2 + from a mitochondrial pool and also that variation in the recovery rate is related to the extent of mitochondrial Ca 2 + loading. Kainate did not alter the mitochondrial membrane potential. These studies reveal that mitochondria have a central role in buffering neuronal [Ca 2 +]i changes mediated by non-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, and that the variation in recovery times following kainate receptor activation reflects a variable degree of mitochondrial Ca 2 + loading. However, unlike NMDA receptor-mediated Ca 2 + <b>loads,</b> kainate <b>receptor</b> activation has minimal effects on mitochondrial function...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, we {{describe}} {{the development of a}} humanoid bipedal robot that fully physically models the human walking system, including the biomechanics of the leg, the sensory feedback pathways available in the body, and the neural structure of the central pattern generator (CPG). Using two different models of the CPG, we explore several issues in the neurobiology and robotics literature, including the role of reflexes in locomotion, the role of load reception and positive force feedback in generating the gait, {{and the degree to which}} central or peripheral control plays in human walking. We show that the walking pattern can be generated by a combination of a half-center CPG and reflex interactions phase modulated by the CPG, and that <b>load</b> <b>receptors</b> in the muscles can play a substantial role in generating the gait, using positive force feedback. We compare the gait of the robot to human subjects and show that this architecture produces human-like stepping. Varying the degree of direct central control of lower limb muscles by the CPG, we show that the most human-like gait is generated with a relatively weak central control signal, which modulates reflex responses that generate most of the muscle activation. These results allow us to conceive of locomotion as a series of nested loops, with a central CPG or rhythm generator modulating lower level reflex interactions, while higher centers modulate the CPG. Since locomotion is a primary mechanism by which animals interact with the world, this research is relevant to artificial intelligence researchers. Recent understanding of cognition holds that minds are embodied, situated relative to a set of goals, and exist in a feedback loop of interaction with the environment. In our robot, we model the dynamics of the body, the neural architecture and the sensory feedback channels in a complete dynamical feedback loop, and show that the robot entrains to the the natural dynamics of the world. We propose the concept of nested loops with descending phase modulation as a conceptual paradigm for a more general understanding of nervous system organization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Antennal {{olfactory}} receptor neurons in {{the boll}} weevil, Anthonomus grandis, were investigated through single neuron recordings. Receptor neurons for both pheromone components and host plant odors {{were associated with}} type I sensilla within the sensory bind regions. Nine types of receptor neurons were identified, based on their responsiveness to the four aggregation pheromone components and selected host plant odors. Three receptor neuron types responded to either compound I, II or IV of the aggregation pheromone. Dose-response curves were similar {{for each of these}} receptor neuron types, which differed only in their key compound. In each instance, I neurons responded primarily to (+ H, the optical isomer produced by the boll weevil which was found to be active in field tests. Receptor neurons for n also responded to a lesser degree to in, its aldehydic analog, at the same stimulus <b>load.</b> Six additional <b>receptor</b> neuron types responded to selected host plant odors: / 3 -caryophyllene, rranj- 2 -hexen-l-ol and other six carbon alcohols and aldehydes, ira/ir-/ 3 -ocimene, benzaldehyde, linalool, and 0 -bisabolol. These neurons were as responsive as, or in some cases more responsive at the same stimulus <b>load</b> as <b>receptor</b> neurons for pheromone components. Receptor neurons responsive to six-carbon alcohols and aldehydes were generally most responsive to rranj- 2 -hexen-l-ol. Receptor neurons for other plant odors responded principally to only one compound among the odorants tested. However, responses of these neurons were not uniform, suggesting possible specialization for other unidentified key odorants. Comparisons were also made between single neuron and electroantennogram responses. The results indicate that the boll weevil, a narrowly oligaphagous insect, detects its host plant at some distance, and utilizes information about a wide range of chemical structures in its olfactory-mediated behavior...|$|R
40|$|Adaptation in leg muscle {{activity}} and coordination between lower limbs were studied during {{walking on a}} treadmill with split belts in one group of parkinsonian patients and one of age-matched healthy subjects. Four different belt speeds (0. 25 / 0. 5 / 0. 75 / 1. 0 m/sec) were applied in selected combinations {{to the left and}} right leg. While these walking conditions were easily tolerated by the healthy subjects, the parkinsonian patients usually reached the limits of their walking capabilities. Both groups adapted automatically to a change in belt speed within approximately 20 stride cycles, Healthy subjects adapted by reorganizing their stride cycle with a relative shortening of duration of support and lengthening of the swing phase of the ''fast'' leg and vice versa on the ''slow'' leg. The patients showed a restricted range of stride frequencies for the various belt speeds during normal and split-belt walking with consequent deviations in the reorganization of the stride cycle, In both healthy subjects and patients, ipsilateral gastrocnemius and contralateral tibialis anterior electromyographic (EMG) activity increased predominantly with an ipsilateral increase in belt speed. Two main differences were observed in the EMG patterns: (1) In the patients leg muscle EMG activity was less modulated and gastrocnemius EMG amplitude was small during normal and split-belt walking. However, {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups in respect to the reorganization of the EMG pattern required for the various split-belt walking conditions. (2) The amount of co-activation of antagonistic leg muscles during the support phase of the stride cycle was greater in the patients compared to the healthy subjects during normal and split-belt walking. It is suggested that reduced EMG modulation and recruitment in the leg extensors may contribute to the impaired walking of the patients. This in rum is a result of an impaired proprioceptive feedback from extensor <b>load</b> <b>receptors.</b> This defective control is partially compensated for in parkinsonian patients by a greater amount of leg flexor activation which leads to a higher degree of co-activation.

40|$|Body loading is a {{fundamental}} parameter that modulates motor output during locomotion, and {{is especially important for}} controlling the generation of stepping patterns, dynamic balance, and termination of locomotion. <b>Load</b> <b>receptors</b> that regulate and control posture and stance in locomotion include the Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles at the hip, knee, and ankle joints, and the Ruffini endings and the Pacinian corpuscles in the soles of the feet. Increased body weight support (BWS) during locomotion results in an immediate reorganization of locomotor control, such as a reduction in stance and double support duration and decreased hip, ankle, and knee angles during the gait cycle. Previous studies on the effect during exposure to increased BWS while walking showed a reduction in lower limb joint angles and gait cycle timing that represents a reorganization of locomotor control. Until now, no studies have investigated how locomotor control responds after a period of exposure to adaptive modification in the body load sensing system. The goal of this research was to determine the adaptive properties of body load-regulating mechanisms in locomotor control during locomotion. We hypothesized that body load-regulating mechanisms contribute to locomotor control, and adaptive changes in these load-regulating mechanisms require reorganization to maintain forward locomotion. Head-torso coordination, lower limb movement patterns, and gait cycle timing were evaluated before and after a 30 -minute adaptation session during which subjects walked on a treadmill at 5. 4 km/hr with 40 % body weight support (BWS). Before and after the adaptation period, head-torso and lower limb 3 D kinematic data were obtained while performing a goal directed task during locomotion with 0 % BWS using a video-based motion analysis system, and gait cycle timing parameters were collected by foot switches positioned under the heel and toe of the subjects shoes. Subjects showed adaptive modification in the body load-regulating mechanisms that included increased head movement amplitude, increased knee and ankle flexion, and increased stance, stride, and double support time, with no change in the performance of the task with respect to that measured before exposure to BWS. These changes in locomotor control are opposite to that reported during 40 % BWS exposure and indicative of an after-effect after removal of the adaptive stimulus. Therefore, it is evident that just 30 minutes of 40 % BWS during locomotion was sufficient to induce adaptive modifications in the body load sensing systems that contribute to reorganization of sensory contributions to stable locomotor control...|$|R

40|$|The present {{investigation}} was directed toward {{answering the question}} of whether some age-related changes of membrane dependent triggering mechanisms during lymphocyte activation could account for depressed T cell response to mitogens in aging. For this purpose, the K+ movements were analyzed in PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PHA-PBL) from old humans (O) compared to adult (A). Indeed, plasma membrane Na+, K+, ATPase activation plays an essential role in cell proliferation and results from direct interaction between the <b>loaded</b> mitogen <b>receptor</b> and the enzyme. No difference could be found in the magnitude and the timing of the PHA-induced increase of K+ fluxes between PHA-PBL from O and A despite a higher K+ inflow in unstimulated but 20 -hour preincubated PBL from O. Further experiments showed that the lectin-induced triggering mechanism of cation transport resulted from digoxine (DGX: a glycosid cardiotonic) sensitive ATPase. Moreover, whereas PBL from O exhibited a decreased PHA-induced DNA synthesis, DGX depressed the thymidine incorporation by 72 -hour cultured PHA-PBL within the same inhibitory dose-related pattern in both O and A. We conclude that the triggering mechanism of Na+, K+ -ATPase induced by PHA occurs adequately in early stimulated PBL from old subjects. In addition, digoxine sensitive structures work freely during PHA-induced lymphocyte proliferation in aging, thereby supporting further arguments for adequate Na+, K+ -ATPase activity.

To confirm the efficacy of these interventions left ventricular volume was monitored using a portable radionuclide probe. Isosorbide dinitrate (5 mgm sublingually) while sitting unloads both baroreceptors and the cardiopulmonary receptors; it decreased left ventricular end-diastolic volume (p or = 0. 10). Leg raising, which <b>loads</b> only cardiopulmonary <b>receptors,</b> increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume (p or = 0. 10). In conclusion, our data suggest that, in normal man, baroreceptor unloading increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic neural control of heart rate; cardiopulmonary reflexes do not appear to have a direct neurally mediated effect on heart rate. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Methods: To {{investigate}} whether insulin receptors con-tribute to abnormal glucose metabolism and whether their regulation is differentially regulated in different tissues, we evaluated the glycemic and insulinemic {{response to an}} oral glucose <b>load,</b> insulin <b>receptor</b> binding, and insulin receptor messengerRNA (mRNA) levels in tissues of rats that were fed either standard rat chow or a diet containing 66 % fructose for 2 weeks. Results: Blood pressure and plasma triglycerides in-creased significantly in the fructose-fed rats, whereas body weight, fasting plasma glucose, and plasma insulin {{did not differ significantly}} from controls. Plasma glucose and in-sulin responses to oral glucose were significantly greater in fructose-fed than in control rats. Insulin receptor-bind-ing characteristics were determined by an in situ auto-radiographic technique associated with computerized microdensitometry. The insulin receptor number was sig-nificantly lower in both skeletal muscle and liver of fruc-tose-fed rats as compared to controls, whereas no difference was observed in the kidney. No significant differences were found in binding affinity. Insulin receptor mRNA levels were determined by slot-blot hybridization with a cRNA probe encoding the 5 end of the rat insulin receptor cDNA. Consistent with binding data, mRNA lev-els were significantly lower in skeletal muscle and liver of fructose-fed rats as compared to controls, but not in the kidney. Conclusions: Decreased number of insulin receptors occurring at the level of gene expression is present in skeletal muscle and liver of fructose-fed rats and might contribute to insulin resistance in this model.

40|$|The hippocampal dentate gyrus {{is one of}} the {{two sites}} of {{continuous}} neurogenesis in adult rodents and humans. Virtually all dentate granule cells have a single immobile cilium with a microtubule spine or axoneme covered with a specialized cell membrane <b>loaded</b> with <b>receptors</b> such as the somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR 3), and the p 75 neurotrophin receptor (p 75 NTR). The signals from these receptors have been reported to stimulate neuroprogenitor proliferation and the post-mitotic maturation of newborn granule cells into functioning granule cells. We have found that in 62 ̆ 01324 -months-old triple transgenic Alzheimer 2 ̆ 019 s disease model mice (3 xTg-AD) producing both A 3 ̆b 21 - 42 and the mutant human tau protein tauP 301 L, the dentate granule cells still had immunostainable SSTR 3 - and p 75 NTR-bearing cilia but they were only half the length of the immunostained cilia in the corresponding wild-type mice. However, the immunostainable length of the granule cell cilia was not reduced either in 2 xTg-AD mice accumulating large amounts of A 3 ̆b 21 - 42 or in mice accumulating only a mutant human tau protein. Thus it appears that a combination of A 3 ̆b 21 - 42 and tau protein accumulation affects the levels of functionally important receptors in 3 xTg-AD mice. These observations raise the important possibility that structural and functional changes in granule cell cilia might have a role in AD. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Antipsychotic {{medications}} {{are thought}} to contribute to neuropsychological impairments associated with schizophrenia, but specific links with pharmacology are not well established. This study investigated associations of specific medication properties with neuropsychological and psychiatric symptoms in a first-episode psychosis sample. Medication doses and indices of receptor antagonism were used to estimate dopamine antagonist, serotonergic antagonist, and anticholinergic loads (i. e., impact of participants’ medications on those receptors). Results indicated higher anticholinergic load was associated with poorer verbal long-term memory and higher D 2 load was associated with poorer motor functioning. Additional exploratory analyses indicated that in non-smokers, higher D 1 load was associated with more severe negative symptoms, whereas higher 5 -HT 2 A load was associated with less severe negative symptoms. In smokers, higher 5 -HT 2 A load was associated with poorer verbal working memory. These results support the validity of estimating medication <b>receptor</b> <b>loads</b> to elucidate specific and dissociable effects of antipsychotic medication properties...|$|R
40|$|SummarySome endocytic cargoes control clathrin-coated pit (CCP) maturation, {{but it is}} {{not known}} how such {{regulation}} is communicated. We found that μ-opioid neuropeptide receptors signal to their enclosing CCPs by ubiquitination. Nonubiquitinated receptors delay CCPs at an intermediate stage of maturation, after clathrin lattice assembly is complete but before membrane scission. Receptor ubiquitination relieves this inhibition, effectively triggering CCP scission and producing a receptor-containing endocytic vesicle. The ubiquitin modification that conveys this endocytosis-promoting signal is added to the receptor’s first cytoplasmic loop, catalyzed by the Smurf 2 ubiquitin ligase, and coordinated with activation-dependent receptor phosphorylation and clustering through Smurf 2 recruitment by the endocytic adaptor beta-arrestin. Epsin 1 detects the signal at the CCP and is required for ubiquitin-promoted scission. This cargo-to-coat communication system mediates a biochemical checkpoint that ensures appropriate receptor ubiquitination for later trafficking, and it controls specific <b>receptor</b> <b>loading</b> into CCPs by sensing when a sufficient quorum is reached.

40|$|The {{siderophore}} transport {{activities of}} the two outer membrane proteins FhuA and FecA of Escherichia coli require the proton motive force of the cytoplasmic membrane. The energy of the proton motive force is postulated to be transduced to the transport proteins by a protein complex that consists of the TonB, ExbB, and ExbD proteins. In the present study, TonB fragments lacking the cytoplasmic membrane anchor were exported to the periplasm by fusing them to the cleavable signal sequence of FecA. Overexpressed TonB(33 - 239), TonB(103 - 239), and TonB(122 - 239) fragments inhibited transport of ferrichrome by FhuA and of ferric citrate by FecA, transcriptional induction of the fecABCDE transport genes by FecA, infection by phage φ 80, and killing of cells by colicin M via FhuA. Transport of ferrichrome by FhuAΔ 5 - 160 was also inhibited by TonB(33 - 239), although FhuAΔ 5 - 160 lacks the TonB box which is involved in TonB binding. The results show that TonB fragments as small as the last 118 amino acids of the protein interfere with the function of wild-type TonB, presumably by competing for binding sites at the transporters or by forming mixed dimers with TonB that are nonfunctional. In addition, the interactions that are inhibited by the TonB fragments must include more than the TonB box, since transport through corkless FhuA was also inhibited. Since the periplasmic TonB fragments cannot assume an energized conformation, these in vivo studies also agree with previous cross-linking and in vitro results, suggesting that neither recognition nor binding to <b>loaded</b> siderophore <b>receptors</b> is the energy-requiring step in the TonB-receptor interactions...|$|R
40|$|Kisspeptin is an {{important}} regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in mammals. It acts on the GnRH neurons trough the GPR 54 receptor initiating GnRH release. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the optimal concentration of kisspeptin- 10 to activate the GPR 54 receptor in vitro. This data is then used for in vitro testing of the kisspeptin antagonist P 271. The GPR 54 receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor, which when activated raises the intracellular calcium level. We used a single-cell fluorescence microscopy on Chem- 1 cells (expressing the human GPR 54 <b>receptor)</b> <b>loaded</b> with the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye Fura- 2. We were unable to create a reproducible concentration-response study, however we found two concentrations of kisspeptin- 10 that gave a reproducible peak (10 - 6 M and 10 - 7 M). These concentrations were used to test the antagonist P 271. In this study peptide P 271 showed agonistic properties and no antagonistic properties. This could be because of the method used in these experiments...|$|R
40|$|Our {{laboratory}} {{has previously}} demonstrated that ultraviolet B radiation impairs contact hypersensitivity induction in ultraviolet B susceptible mice through a tumor necrosis factor-α-dependent mechanism, involving calcitonin gene related peptide and cutaneous mast cells. This {{study was designed}} to test directly whether mast cells are the source of tumor necrosis factor-α, to account for the ultra-violet B-susceptible phenotype. As dermal mast cells seem to release tumor necrosis factor-α following exposure to ultraviolet B, we investigated whether tumor necrosis factor-α released by mast cells could mediate impairment of contact hypersensitivity {{in a manner similar to}} that found with ultraviolet B radiation treatment. First, we <b>loaded</b> Fcε <b>receptors</b> of mast cells of ultraviolet B-susceptible (C 3 H/HeN), ultraviolet B-resistant (C 3 H/HeJ), and mast-cell deficient (Sl/Sld) mice by intradermal injections of anti-dinitrophenyl immunoglobulin E antibodies. Twenty-four hours later, dinitrophenyl was injected intravenously, and within 30 min oxazolone was painted on injected skin sites. Contact hypersen-sitivity induction was impaired in ultraviolet B-susceptible mice, but not in ultraviolet B-resistant or Sl/Sld mice, and treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor-α antibodies was able to reverse this impairment of contact hypersensitivity. Second, we have found that ultraviolet B radiation did not impair contact hypersensitivity induction when haptens were painted on irradiated skin of mast cell deficient mice. As ultraviolet B radiation impairs contact hypersensitivity induction through a tumor necrosis factor-α-dependent mechanism, we conclude that ultraviolet B radiation triggers the prompt release of tumor necrosis factor-α from dermal mast cells, and that mast cell-derived tumor necrosis factor-α interferes with generation of the hapten-specific signal required for contact hypersensitivity induction. In addition, we are providing data that indicate that tumor necrosis factor-α levels released from mast cells as well as sensitivity of Langerhans cells to tumor necrosis factor-α contribute in defining the phenotypes of resistance versus sensitivity to ultra-violet B radiation...|$|R
40|$|Under iron-limiting conditions, Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes a {{fluorescent}} siderophore called pyoverdin (PaA), which, after complexing iron, is transported {{back into the}} cells via its outer membrane receptor FpvA. The recent finding that all FpvA receptors on the bacterial cell surface are loaded with iron-free PaA under iron limiting conditions has {{raised questions about the}} mechanism by which P. aeruginosa transports efficiently iron. We used [(3) H]PaA' [(55) Fe]PaA-Fe, and a kinetically stable chromium-PaA complex to show that iron <b>loading</b> of the <b>receptor</b> occurs through a siderophore displacement mechanism in vivo. Moreover, the fluorescence properties of iron-free PaA revealed that, after PaA-Fe uptake and dissociation, the PaA molecule is recycled into the extracellular medium. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the PaA chromophore and the FpvA tryptophans in vivo to monitor the kinetics of PaA displacement by PaA-Fe at the cell surface, the dissociation of iron from the siderophore, and the recycling of PaA back to the receptor on the outer membrane of the bacteria in real time. The loading status of FpvA (PaA versus PaA-Fe) was shown to depend on the relative concentration of the two forms of pyoverdin in the growth medium...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work is {{motivated}} by experimental observations that cells on stretched substrate exhibit different responses to static and dynamic loads. A model of focal adhesion that can consider the mechanics of stress fiber, adhesion bonds, and substrate was developed {{at the molecular level}} by treating the focal adhesion as an adhesion cluster. The stability of the cluster under dynamic load was studied by applying cyclic external strain on the substrate. We show that a threshold value of external strain amplitude exists beyond which the adhesion cluster disrupts quickly. In addition, our results show that the adhesion cluster is prone to losing stability under high-frequency <b>loading,</b> because the <b>receptors</b> and ligands cannot get enough contact time to form bonds due to the high-speed deformation of the substrate. At the same time, the viscoelastic stress fiber becomes rigid at high frequency, which leads to significant deformation of the bonds. Furthermore, we find that the stiffness and relaxation time of stress fibers play important roles in the stability of the adhesion cluster. The essence of this work is to connect the dynamics of the adhesion bonds (molecular level) with the cell's behavior during reorientation (cell level) through the mechanics of stress fiber. The predictions of the cluster model are consistent with experimental observations...|$|R
