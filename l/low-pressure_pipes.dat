40|$|AbstractOne {{option to}} decarbonise {{residential}} {{heat in the}} UK is to convert the existing natural gas networks to deliver hydrogen. We review the technical feasibility of this option using semi-structured interviews underpinned by a literature review and we assess the potential economic benefits using the UK MARKAL energy systems model. We conclude that hydrogen can be transported safely in the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>pipes</b> but we identify concerns over the reduced capacity {{of the system and}} the much lower linepack storage compared to natural gas. New hydrogen meters and sensors would have to be fitted to every building in a hydrogen conversion program and appliances would have to be converted unless the government was to legislate to make them hydrogen-ready in advance. Converting the gas networks to hydrogen is a lower-cost residential decarbonisation pathway for the UK than those identified previously. The cost-optimal share of hydrogen is sensitive to the conversion cost and to variations in the capital costs of heat pumps and micro-CHP fuel cells. With such small cost differentials between technologies, the decision to convert the networks will also depend on non-economic factors including the relative performance of technologies and the willingness of the government to organise a conversion program...|$|E
40|$|There {{are strong}} interdependencies between water use in {{agriculture}} and energy consumption as water saving technologies can require increased pumping and pressurizing. The Chinese Government includes water efficiency improvement and carbon intensity reduction {{targets in the}} 12 th Five-Year Plan (5 YP. 2011 – 2015), yet the links between energy use and irrigation modernization are not always addressed in policy targets. Here we build an original model of the energy embedded in water pumping for irrigated agriculture and its related processes. The model {{is based on the}} physical processes of irrigation schemes and the implication of technological developments, comprising all processes from extraction and conveyance of water to its application in the field. The model uses data from government sources to assess policy targets for deployment of irrigation technologies, which aim to reduce water application and contribute to adaptation of Chinese agriculture to climate change. The consequences of policy targets involve co-beneficial outcomes that achieve water and energy savings, or trade-offs in which reduced water application leads to increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We analyze irrigation efficiency and energy use in four significant provinces and nationally, using scenarios based on the targets of the 12 th 5 YP. At the national scale, we find that expansion of sprinklers and micro-irrigation as outlined in the 5 YP would increase GHG emissions from agricultural water use, however, emissions decrease in those provinces with predominant groundwater use and planned expansion of <b>low-pressure</b> <b>pipes.</b> We show that the most costly technologies relate to trade-offs, while co-benefits are generally achieved with less expensive technologies. The investment cost per area of irrigation technology expansion does not greatly affect the outcome in terms of water, but in terms of energy the most expensive technologies are more energy-intensive and produce more emissions. The results show that water supply configuration (proportion of surface to groundwater) largely determines the potential energy savings from reductions in water application. The paper examines the importance of fertigation and highlights briefly some policy implications...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigates the}} damage {{distribution}} of buried pipes due to recent earthquakes in Japan. First, various damage datasets, e. g. water <b>pipes,</b> <b>low-pressure</b> gas <b>pipes,</b> mid-pressure gas pipes, sewage lines, collapsed houses, liquefaction occurrences, are integrated on Geographic Information System (GIS). Using the datasets, {{spatial distribution of}} damages is investigated with respect to geomorphological land classification and altitude. Then, the damage ratios of lifeline systems are compared under various conditions. Finally, the minimum dis-tances among the damaged locations are measured and the spatial correlations of damages to the lifeline systems are evaluated. The {{results of this study}} suggest that the damage incidents to <b>low-pressure</b> gas <b>pipes</b> are often found near those to water distribution pipes. Hence, the interac-tions among functional losses of lifeline systems are expected to be taken into consideration in the restoration process after urban earthquakes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{provides}} a cost-effectiveness analysis of four water-saving irrigation techniques that are widely implemented in China {{to address the}} impacts of climate change: sprinkler irrigation, micro-irrigation, <b>low-pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> irrigation and channel lining. The aim is to thoroughly understand the economic feasibility of water-saving irrigation as an approach to coping with climate change. Based on the cost-effectiveness analysis, this study finds that water-saving irrigation is cost-effective in coping with climate change, and has benefits for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and for sustainable economic development. For the cost-effectiveness ratio of mitigation and adaptation, only that of channel lining is negative (for mitigation is − 43. 02 to − 73. 41 US$/t, for grain yield increase − 34. 35 to − 20. 13 US$/t, and for water saving − 0. 020 to − 0. 012 US$/m 3). Sprinkler irrigation has the highest incremental cost for mitigation (476. 03 – 691. 64 US$/t), because when sprinkler irrigation is used, there may be additional energy needs to meet water pressure requirements, which may increase greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional irrigation. For mitigation, in districts where the pumping head for pressure {{is lower than the}} critical energy saving head, sprinkler irrigation should be avoided. Micro-irrigation has the highest incremental cost for adaptation followed by sprinkler irrigation and <b>low-pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> irrigation, but when considering the revenues from improved adaptation, all of the measures assessed are economically feasible. The results suggest that for mitigation and adaptation objectives, micro-irrigation performs best. From an economic perspective, channel lining is recommended. Therefore, a balanced development of channel lining and micro-irrigation according to different geographical conditions is recommended...|$|R
40|$|What is a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> system? A <b>low-pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> (LPP) {{system is}} a shallow, pressure-dosed soil {{absorption}} system with a network of small diameter perforated pipes placed in narrow trenches. Originating in North Carolina and Wisconsin, LPP systems were developed {{as an alternative to}} conventional soil absorption systems to eliminate problems such as: clogging of the soil from localized overloading, mechanical sealing of the soil trench during construction, anaerobic conditions due to continuous saturation, and a high water table. The LPP system has the following design features that overcome these problems: 1) shallow placement, 2) narrow trenches, 3) continuous trenching, 4) pressure-dosed with uniform distribution of the effluent, 5) design based on areal loading, and 6) resting and reaeration between doses. The main components of an LPP system are: • a septic tank or an aerobic unit; • pumping (dosing) chamber (submersible effluent pump, level controls, high water alarm, and supply manifold); and • small diameter distribution laterals with small perforations (holes). The septic tank is where settleable and floatable solids are removed and primary treatment occurs. Partially clarified effluent then flows by gravity to a pumping chamber where it is stored until it reaches the level of A General Overview the upper float control, which turns the pump on. The level controls are set for a specific pumping sequence of one to two times daily, allowing breaks in between doses for the soil to absorb the wastewater. However, the dosing mechanisms and frequency may vary for different systems. The pump moves the effluent through the supply line and manifold to the distribution laterals under low pressure. The laterals are a network of PVC pipes that have small, drilled holes through which the wastewater is distributed evenly. Th...|$|R

The minimum distances between the damaged locations were measured, and the spatial correlations of damage incidents to lifeline sys-tems were evaluated. In addition, the damage ratios of water distribution pipes were compared with different fragility curves constructed from the damage datasets for the 1995 Kobe earthquake and other recent earthquakes in Japan...|$|R
40|$|Although not an {{alternative}} to all unsuitable soils, the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> (LPP) system {{has proven to be}} useful for some specific conditions, where conventional systems frequently fail. Less than one-third of the land area in the U. S. has soil conditions suitable for conventional soil absorption systems. Numerous innovative alternatives to the conventional septic tank soil absorption system have evolved in response to the demand for an environmentally acceptable and economical means of disposing domestic wastewater onsite and contending with the restrictive soil conditions common in many states. Originating in North Carolina and Wisconsin, a LPP system is a shallow, pressure-dosed soil absorption system with a network of small diameter perforated pipes placed 25. 4 to 45. 7 cm (10 to 18 inches) deep in narrow trenches, 30. 5 to 45. 7 cm (12 to 18 inches) wide.

40|$|Onsite {{wastewater}} treatment systems (OWTS) typically process eight to twelve kilograms of nitrogen per system annually. There are approximately two million OWTS in operation in North Carolina. If the mass and concentration of nitrogen discharged from these OWTS are not reduced before the effluent reaches groundwater and/or surface waters, then public {{and environmental health}} may be threatened. Increased nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3) concentrations in drinking water can cause methemoglobinemia, sometimes called blue baby syndrome. Groundwater transport and discharge of ammonium-nitrogen (NH 4) and NO 3 to surface waters can lead to algal blooms, eutrophic conditions and fish kills. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the nitrogen treatment efficiency of OWTS installed in the piedmont region of North Carolina. Five (volunteered) sites with OWTS in the piedmont counties of Wake (n = 1) and Durham (n = 4) were instrumented with piezometers (34 total) near and down-gradient from the OWTS. Two OWS were conventional style, two were surface discharge sand filter systems and one was a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> system. Septic tank, groundwater from the piezometers, sand filter effluent, and surface waters down-gradient from the OWTS were sampled for nitrogen concentrations. Data shows that total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentrations in groundwater beneath the drainfield trenches of conventional style OWS and in the effluent of surface discharge sand filters were on average 93 % and 81 % lower than septic tank effluent concentrations, respectively. Therefore, the conventional style OWTS were contributing lower concentrations of TDN to surface waters than the surface discharge sand filters. The findings of this study will be useful regarding management of OWTS derived nutrients in nutrient sensitive watersheds in the Piedmont of North Carolina...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{procedure}} that can potentially predict the residual lifetime of <b>low-pressure</b> uPVC <b>pipes</b> in a non-destructive way. Ageing of these materials is characterised by a change in yield stress and fracture behaviour. The search for a method being able to non-destructively evaluate the yield stress and the fracture behaviour led {{to the study of}} scratching of the polymer surface. According to an extensive study by Atkins and Liu, the scratching behaviour is a function of yield stress, fracture toughness and the attack angle of the cutting tool. Experiments reported in this paper give an evaluation of the scratched area {{as a function of the}} attack angle for uPVC samples having different ageing times. Existing analyses for metals are adapted for polymer specific properties, such as the pronounced strain rate dependence of yield stress and visco-elastic recovery. The suggested adaptations are successful in the sense that the resulting analysis is capable of describing the forces during scratching and the resulting cross-sectional area of the groove. Although the scratching technique was not able to discriminate between differences in the scratch force or cross-sectional area of the groove of the different ageing times, it was possible to get an estimate of the fracture toughness from the analysis. Therefore, scratching is a promising technique to determine the fracture toughness for ductile materials for which it is difficult to obtain accurate results with conventional techniques...|$|R
