40|$|Modern file systems {{leverage}} the Copy-on-Write (COW) {{technique to}} efficiently create snapshots. COW can signif-icantly reduce demand on disk space and I/O bandwidth by not duplicating entire files {{at the time}} of making the snap-shots. However, memory space and I/O requests demanded by applications cannot benefit from this technique. In ex-isting systems, a disk block shared by multiple files due to COW would be read from the disk multiple times. Each block in the reads is treated as an independent one in dif-ferent files and is cached as a sperate block in memory. This issue {{is due to the fact}} that current file access and caching are based on <b>logic</b> <b>file</b> addresses. It poses a significant challenge on the emerging light-weight container virtualization tech-niques, such as Linux Container and Docker, which rely on COW to quickly spawn a large number of thin-provisioned container instances. We propose a lightweight approach to address this issue by leveraging knowledge about files pro-duced by COW. Experimental results show that a prototyped system using the approach, named TotalCOW, can signif-icantly remove redundant disk reads and caching without compromising efficiency of accessing COW files. 1...|$|E

As a result, in-the-field error rate may increase due to both actual errors and latent defects.

40|$|Power {{density is}} a growing problem in {{high-performance}} processors in which small, high-activity resources overheat. Two categories of techniques, temporal and spatial, can address power density in a processor. Temporal solutions slow computation and heating either through frequency and voltage scaling or through stopping computation long enough to allow the processor to cool; both degrade performance. Spatial solutions reduce heat by moving computation from a hot resource to an alternate resource (e. g., a spare ALU) to allow cooling. Spatial solutions are appealing because they have negligible impact on performance, but they require availability of spatial slack {{in the form of}} spare or underutilized resource copies. Previous work focusing on spatial slack within a pipeline has proposed adding extra resource copies to the pipeline, which adds substantial complexity because the resources that overheat, issue <b>logic,</b> register <b>files,</b> and ALUs, are the resources in some of the tightest critical paths in the pipeline. Previous work has not considered exploiting the spatial slack already existing within pipeline resource copies. Utilization can be quite asymmetric across resource copies, leaving some copies substantially cooler than others. We observe that asymmetric utilization within copies of three key back-end resources, the issue queue, register files, and ALUs, creates spatial slack opportunities. By balancing asymmetry in their utilization, we can reduce power density. Scheduling policies for these resources were designed for maximum simplicity before power density was a concern; our challenge is to address asymmetric heating while keeping the pipeline simple. Balancing asymmetric utilization reduces the need for other performancedegrading temporal power-density techniques. While our techniques do not obviate temporal techniques in high-resource-utilization applications, we greatly reduce their use, improving overall performance. ...|$|R

We present the features of the Swift infrastructure by describing them in relation with a successful ongoing project that is being conducted by researchers from the Economics Depart-ment at the University of Chicago.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} structural separation logic, a novel program reasoning {{approach for}} software that manipulates both standard heaps and structured data such as lists and trees. Structural separation logic builds upon existing work in both separation logic and context logic. It considers data abstractly, {{much as it}} is exposed by library interfaces, ignoring implementation details. We provide a programming language that works over structural heaps, which are similar to standard heaps but allow data to be stored in an abstract form. We introduce abstract heaps, which extend structural heaps to enable local reasoning about abstract data. Such data can be split up with structural addresses. Structural addresses allow sub-data (e. g. a sub-tree within a tree) to be abstractly allocated, promoting the sub-data to an abstract heap cell. This cell can be analysed in isolation, then re-joined with the original data. We show how the tight footprints this allows can be refined further with promises, which enable abstract heap cells to retain information about the context from which they were allocated. We prove that our approach is sound with respect to a standard Hoare logic. We study two large examples. Firstly, we present an axiomatic semantics for the Docu- ment Object Model in structural separation logic. We demonstrate how structural separa- tion logic allows abstract reasoning about the DOM tree using tighter footprints than were possible in previous work. Secondly, we give a novel presentation of the POSIX file system library. We identify a subset of the large POSIX standard that focuses on the file system, including commands that manipulate both the file heap and the directory structure. Axioms for this system are given using structural separation <b>logic.</b> As <b>file</b> system resources are typically identified by paths, we use promises to give tight footprints to commands, so that that they do not require all the resource needed to explain paths being used. We demonstrate our reasoning using a software installer example. Open Acces...|$|R

Students in this course have had some programming experience, and may have taken a one-quarter digital design course. Before Sloop-SMOK, assignments in this course were typically assembly language program implementations of functions related to architecture. The major goals in building Sloop-SMOK were to improve the relevance of homework assignments to machine organization, and to emphasize some fundamental concepts of modern processors not easily addressed previously. Sloop-SMOK has two components. The Sloop is a machine architecture {{designed to}} allow implementation of a modern version of the 6502, the processor used in one of the early Atari game stations. The Sloop defines a RISC ISA and a set of on-the-fly translations from the original 6502 CISC ISA into Sloop instructions. The Sloop Machine Organization Kit (SMOK) is a general-purpose software machine organization simulator. The components of a SMOK model are at the level of detail found in typical machine organization texts: ALUs, register <b>files,</b> <b>logic</b> gates, and the like. SMOK provides a graphical interface to construct and debug models. As homework assignments, students use SMOK to build Sloop machines that successfully run most original 6502 games.

It is particularly useful for documenting library modules, for which it automatically generates a rich description of the module interface.

A fundamental advantage of using lpdoc is that it helps maintaining a true correspondence between the program and its documentation, and also identifying precisely to what version of the program a given printed manual corresponds. The quality of the documentation generated can be greatly enhanced by including within the program text assertions (declarations with types, modes, etc.) for the predicates in the program, and machine-readable comments. One of the main novelties of lpdoc is that these assertions and comments are written using the Ciao system assertion language, which is also the language of communication between the compiler and the user and between the components of the compiler.

In this work the design of the solar panel Biaxial characterized by the ability to move in the horizontal and vertical directions. Has been used a fuzzy controller which is dominated by the main portion of the solar tracker positioning of the engines that drives the solar panel to face the sun. Mechanical design consists of rotary joints and two engines. The tracking system makes the solar system more efficient by keeping the face of the solar panel perpendicular to the sun and thus extract the majority of solar energy has led to increased overall efficiency. In this work propos a method to track the sun's rays using sensors solar tracker by the sun and by changing the direction of the solar panel in the vertical and horizontal directions by two engines. Require a sun tracker controller effective. The user is controlled and fuzzy logic controller (FLC). The main idea of this work is to build a digital FLC using fuzzy equations and can be implemented on the FPGA in a practical way, and the advantage of this design is the possibility of FLC used for any other application without changing any part in the main design of the FLC only change the external standard inputs and outputs.
