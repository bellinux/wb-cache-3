50|$|It {{has been}} known for many years that an {{inactive}} iridium or cobalt metal object can be machined to size. In the case of cobalt it is common to alloy it with nickel to improve the mechanical properties. In the case of iridium a thin wire or rod could be used. These precursor materials can then be placed in stainless steel containers that have been <b>leak</b> <b>tested</b> before being converted into radioactive sources. These objects can be processed by neutron activation to form gamma-emitting radioisotopes. The stainless steel has only a small ability to be activated and the small activity due to 55Fe and 63Ni are unlikely to pose a problem in the final application because these isotopes are beta emitters, which have very weak gamma emission. The 59Fe isotope which might form has a short half-life, so by allowing a cobalt source to stand for a year much of this isotope will decay away.|$|E

40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2010, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) {{contracted}} with vendors to design and build 6 CVS containment vessels {{as part of their}} effort to ship Fuel Derived Mixed Fission Product material. The 6 CVS design is based on the Savannah River National Laboratory's (SRNL) design for 9975 and 9977 six inch diameter containment vessels. The main difference between the designs is that the 6 CVS credits the inner O-ring seal as the containment boundary while the SRNL design credits the outer O-ring seal. Since the <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> must be done with the inner O-ring in place, the containment vessel does not have a pathway for getting the helium into the vessel during the <b>leak</b> <b>test.</b> The <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> contractor was not able to get acceptable leak rates with the specified O-ring, but they were able to pass the <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> with a slightly larger O-ring. ANL asked the SRNL to duplicate the <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> vendor's method to determine the cause of the high leak rates. The SRNL testing showed that the helium leak indications were caused by residual helium left within the 6 CVS Closure Assembly by the <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> technique, and by helium permeation through the Viton O-ring seals. After SRNL completed their <b>tests,</b> the <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> contractor was able to measure acceptable leak rates by using the slightly larger O-ring size, by purging helium from the lid threads, and by being very quick in getting the bell jar under a full vacuum.

40|$|SUMMARY: A newly {{constructed}} single-lined geomembrane {{municipal solid}} waste (MSW) landfill cell developed leaks after two to five meters of waste {{were placed in the}} cell. The primary liner was initially <b>leak</b> <b>tested</b> using an electrical leak location method after the protective drainage soil was placed on the liner. All leaks that were located were repaired. Therefore, the reported leakage was caused by damage to the liner during the placement of the waste material. Because the landfill had up to five meters of waste material covering the liner, a standard electrical leak location survey was not practical. Therefore the newly-developed Electrical Leak Imaging Method (ELIM) was used to locate leaks. Three leaks were located using ELIM. The leaks were repaired and no further leakage has been reported. 1...|$|E

The test containers were designed to simulate the environmental characteristics of the caverns at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). The support and control systems used to operate and maintain the Gas Generation Experiment (GGE) include the following: glovebox atmosphere and pressure control, test container support, glovebox operation support, and gas supply and exhaust systems. The glovebox atmosphere and pressure control systems consist of various components used to control both the pressure {{and quality of the}} argon atmosphere inside the glovebox. The glovebox pressure is maintained by three separate pressure control systems. The primary pressure control system is designed to maintain the glovebox at a negative pressure with the other two control systems serving as redundant safety backups. The quality of the argon atmosphere is controlled using a purifying bed system that removes oxygen and moisture. Glovebox atmosphere contaminants that are monitored on a continuous or periodic basis include moisture, oxygen, and nitrogen. The gas generation experiment requires the test containers to be filled with brine, <b>leak</b> <b>tested,</b> maintained at a constant temperature, and the gas head space of the test container sampled on a periodic basis.

The atmospheric pressure electrobalance was used during the quarter for studies of the regeneration of FeS with O{sub 2 }/N{sub 2 } gas mixtures. Some anomalies in the data initially obtained required adjustment of balance sensitivity, reduction of sample size, and recalibration of the air rotameter. The authors are now confident that they can routinely obtain accurate and reproducible data with this unit. Definitive tests of effects of temperature, O{sub 2 } concentration, and gas flow rate will be done next quarter. The high pressure electrobalance was put into service, and calibration experiments were started. Decomposition of CuSO{sub 4 }{center_dot} 5 H{sub 2 }O produced agreement with expected results. Heating of FeS in an O{sub 2 }/N{sub 2 } gas stream gave results in qualitative agreement with experiments using the atmospheric pressure electrobalance.

40|$|In {{subatomic}} particle physics, unstable particles {{can be detected}} with a so-called vertex detector, placed inside a particle accelerator. A detecting unit close to the accelerator bunch of charged particles must {{be separated from the}} accelerator vacuum. A thin sheet with a complex 3 D shape prevents the detector vacuum from polluting the accelerator vacuum. Therefore, this sheet has to be completely leak tight. However, this can conflict with restrictions concerning maximum sheet thickness of the product. To produce such a complex thin sheet, superplastic forming can be very attractive in cases where a small number of products is needed. In order to predict gas permeability of these formed sheets, many mechanical experiments are necessary, where the gas leak has to be measured. To obtain insight in the mechanical behaviour of the used material, ALNOVI- 1, tensile experiments were performed to describe the uniaxial stress–strain behaviour. From these experiments, a high strain rate sensitivity was measured. The flow stress of this material under superplastic conditions was low and the material behaved in an isotropic manner upon large plastic strains. The results of these experiments were used to predict the forming pressure as a function of time in a free bulge experiment, such that a predefined target strain rate will not be exceeded in the material. An extra parameter within these bulging experiments is the application of a hydrostatic pressure during the forming process. Such a pressure postpones the nucleation and growth of internal cavities, which means that higher plastic strains can be reached before failure. Results from these experiments showed that at higher hydrostatic pressures, higher bulges were made. All these bulges were <b>leak</b> <b>tested,</b> showing also that higher hydrostatic pressures lead to a lower void volume fraction at higher hydrostatic pressures, since these bulges were more leak tight at the same bulge height than bulges made without the application of this pressure.

The MCOs contain metallic uranium SNF that {{have been removed from}} the 100 K Area fuel storage water basins (i. e., the K East and K West Basins) at the US. Department of Energy Hanford Site in Southeastern Washington state. Removal of free water is necessary to halt water-induced corrosion of exposed uranium surfaces and to allow the MCOs and their SNF payloads to be safely transported to the Hanford Site 200 East Area and stored within the SNF Project Canister Storage Building (CSB). The CVDF is located within a few hundred yards of the basins, southwest of the 165 KW Power Control Building and the 105 KW Reactor Building. The site area required for the facility and vehicle circulation is approximately 2 acres. Access and egress is provided by the main entrance to the 100 K inner area using existing roadways. The CVDF will remove free. water from the MCOs to reduce the potential for continued fuel-water corrosion reactions. The cold vacuum drying process involves the draining of bulk water from the MCO and subsequent vacuum drying. The MCO will be evacuated to a pressure of 8 torr or less and backfilled with an inert gas (helium). The MCO will be sealed, <b>leak</b> <b>tested,</b> and then transported to the CSB within a sealed shipping cask.

40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has {{published}} a standard that specifies the criteria for preparation and packaging of plutonium metals and oxides for safe long-term storage (DOE-STD- 3013 - 96). This standard is followed for the packaging of materials resulting from the disassembly of nuclear weapons at Los Alamos National Laboratory under the Advanced Retirement and Integrated Extraction System (ARIES) project. Declassified plutonium metal or oxide material from the ARES project is packaged into doubly contained and welded type 304 L stainless steel containers that comply with the DOE standard. The 3013 - 96 standard describes requirements for maximum contamination limits on the outer surface of the sealed inner container. These limits are 500 dpm per 100 cm 2 for direct measurements and 20 dpm per 100 cm 2 for removable contamination. For containers filled, welded, and handled inside a highly contaminated glovebox line, these limits are difficult to obtain. Simple handling within the line is demonstrated to contaminate surfaces from 10, 000 to 10, 000, 000 dpm alpha per 100 cm 2. To routinely achieve contamination levels below the maximum contamination levels specified by the 3013 - 96 standard within a processing operation, a decontamination step must be included. In the ARIES line, this decontamination step is an electrolytic process that produces a controlled uniform etch of the container surfaces. Decontamination of the 3013 - 96 compliant ARIES inner container is well demonstrated. Within 30 to 50 minutes electrolysis time, tixed contamination is reduced to hundreds of dpm generally occurring only at electrode contact points and welds. Removable contamination is routinely brought to non-detectable levels. The total process time for the cycle (includes electrolysis, rinse, and dry stages) is {{on the order of}} 1. 5 to 2 hours per container. The ARIES inner container decontamination system highly automated and consists of a plumbing loop, electronic controls and process monitors, and a decontamination chamber or "fixture".

The welded and <b>leak</b> <b>tested</b> container is placed into the fixture through a door on the contaminated side and the electrolysis process is run, including rinse and dry cycles.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{petroleum}} wells exhibiting pressure build-up in the annulus {{as a result}} of lost cement integrity is evident, this is known as Sustained Casing Pressure (SCP). There are several factors contributing to lost integrity, among them are a poor primary cementing operation and casing expansion resulting in cement sheath failure due to alternations in pressure and temperature. Fluid migration (mainly gas) can happen over the cemented column over the entire life-cycle of a well, the remedial methods available for mitigation or minimizing of this migration requires a large workover intervention where cement is used as the sealing material. Cement does present in many cases a challenge to successfully achieve a long-term integrity due to its brittleness, limited strength, low flexibility and poor shear bond properties. The need for alternative plugging materials and placement methods are therefore apparent. One possible alternative is a thermosetting polymer based system, which gives a higher tensile and compressive strength, more flexible and a higher adhesion to other materials. This thesis will focus on remedial treatment of a typical SCP application, hence cement is present in the annulus. The placement method focused on is the electric wireline conveyed CannSeal tool provided by a Norwegian technology company. The tool perforates the casing and injects a sealant into the annulus. The tool and method have been run for different operator companies for sealing an open annulus (no cement present) in relations to Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) operations. Presented and discussed in this thesis is a test project where four large-scale annulus tests cells filled with cement was built, then <b>leak</b> <b>tested</b> as an SCP application. After the leak rate was established, the CannSeal tool was fed into the cell, made a communication to the cement sheet by perforating and then injected a sealant resin (epoxy) into the cemented annulus. The conclusion for the results was that using the CannSeal technology and injecting a resin sealant into the cemented annulus significantly reduced the gas leak. On all four cells the measured average gas breakthrough differential pressures including all cells were 25 bar prior to injection, and 130 bar after injection and curing of the resin. Because of the positive results achieved in this project, the concept of remedial repair of SCP with injecting a resin will be field trialed at the Shell test center in Rijswijk summer 2017...|$|E
