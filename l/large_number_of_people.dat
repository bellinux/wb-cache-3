5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor brands matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> donate to disaster relief following hurricanes with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following Hurricane Katrina). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{had been}} {{authorized}} by Congress to recruit {{an army of}} up to 28,501 troops, but he had only 19,000 when he reached New York. Military discipline was inadequate; routine orders were not carried out, muskets were fired in camp, flints were ruined, bayonets were used as knives to cut food, and firearm readiness was lax. Petty internal conflict was common under the strain of a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> from different environments and temperaments in relative closeness.|$|E
5|$|According to Tino's account, {{on the day}} of the election, Selvo was {{attending}} mass for the funeral of the late Doge at the new monastery church of San Nicolò built under Domenico Contarini on Lido, an island in the Venetian Lagoon. The location was ideal for the funeral of a Doge not only because St Mark's Basilica was under construction at the time, but the new church was also spacious enough to hold a fairly <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> The location also proved ideal for the election of a new Doge for the very same reasons.|$|E

The European Green Party estimated that the arrangement costs 200million euro and 20,268 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Brussels is preferred by some due {{to the presence of}} other institutions and other groups whereas Strasbourg is supported due to its historical importance to European unity.|$|E

Murphy's gravesite is in Section 46, headstone number 46-366-11, located across Memorial Drive from the Amphitheater.

On the twelfth night of Christmas, the tree is taken down for recycling. Westminster City Council threatened to abandon the event to save £5,000 in 1980 but the decision was reversed.|$|E

The ceremony was performed by Miss Bletcher, the daughter {{of one of the}} Directors, after which a luncheon for a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> was held in a marquee. Following speeches, about 400 children were given a free tea in the Temperance Hall, while adults were catered for in the schoolrooms of four local chapels. Sports were then held, watched by a crowd of 1,500, and finally there was a fireworks display. Most of the children later received a commemorative medal.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Beryl was a weak system, {{and unlike}} Alberto, its rapid motion up the Eastern Seaboard spread its heavy {{rainfall}} across a large area. Beryl caused inland flooding {{as it moved}} through Georgia, across the Carolinas, {{and all the way}} to Connecticut. Property damage reached at least $74.22 million, with $40 million in damage in South Carolina, $15 million in Virginia, $12 million in New York, $5.9 million in Florida, and at least $1.32 million in Georgia. Five deaths were reported, while a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> ndash& 37 in Lexington County, South Carolina, alone ndash& were injured by the tornadoes Beryl produced as it weakened.|$|E
5|$|As the Cardiff team bus {{arrived at}} the stadium, the fans threw leeks at the vehicle.

He found the owners of the animal, who agreed to let the club keep the cat in return for two final tickets if they progressed that far. Police reinforcements were required at Empire Stadium, as at 1pm a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> had gathered outside the ticket office in a threatening manner.

5|$|Famines became {{common in}} {{northern}} China {{in the early}} 17th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season – effects of a larger ecological event {{now known as the}} Little Ice Age. Famine, alongside tax increases, widespread military desertions, a declining relief system, and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility. The central government, starved of resources, could do very little to mitigate the effects of these calamities. Making matters worse, a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan, killing an unknown but <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> The deadliest earthquake of all time, the Shaanxi earthquake of 1556, occurred during the Jiajing Emperor's reign, killing approximately 830,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{control of}} Texas was {{followed}} by Mexican control of Texas, {{and it can be}} difficult to separate the Spanish and Mexican influences on the future state. The most obvious legacy is that of the language; the state's name comes from the Spanish rendering of an Indian word. Every major river in modern Texas, except the Red River, has a Spanish or Anglicized name, as do 42 of the state's 254 counties and numerous towns also bear Spanish names. Even many of the words that have been incorporated into American English, such as barbecue, canyon, ranch, and plaza, come from Spanish words. An additional obvious legacy is that of Roman Catholicism. At the end of Spain's reign over Texas, virtually all inhabitants practiced the Catholic religion, and it is still practiced in Texas by a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> The Spanish missions built in San Antonio to convert Indians to Catholicism have been restored and are a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> staged protests near Jantar Mantar, New Delhi.

One group of protesters also observed a one-day hunger strike at Jantar Mantar. All roads leading to India Gate were closed by police and areas where protesters had gathered {{during the previous}} week were out of bounds to the public. Some of the protesters drew graffiti and slogans on papers spread on the road, condemning the incident and demanding stricter laws and speedy judgement. The BJP renewed its demand for a special parliament session to discuss the case and to adopt stricter laws on crime against women.|$|E
