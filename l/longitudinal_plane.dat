There is a central raised line or slight ridge on this inner surface, and on each side in the upper part there is a small, white, roughened knob, corresponding with the similar knobs on the carinal margins of the terga.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDiagnosis and {{measuring}} {{the level of}} increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) is critical, especially {{for the management of}} trauma patients in the emergency department and intensive care unit. However, measurements are operator-dependent as in all of the sonographic diagnoses. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the operator variations in the measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). There were four emergency medicine specialists involved in the study. Each had at least 1 year of experience of ultrasound scans and performed at least 25 prior ocular scans examining the ONSD. Two measurements were made 1 week apart from both axial and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>planes.</b> Sixty healthy adults were involved in the study and every investigator obtained four measurements from each. Intra-interobserver reliabilities were tested. The investigators performed 60 ocular ultrasounds on individual healthy adults and obtained two measurements in axial and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>planes</b> 1 week apart. Therefore, 960 measurements were analyzed. The levels of compatibilities for most of the measurements were found at acceptable levels statistically. However, it is not possible to say that there was a perfect compatibility among the sonographers according to the previously conducted reliability studies of ultrasound measurements. According to our results, it is hard to say that sonographic measurement of the ONSD is a highly reliable method both in <b>longitudinal</b> and transverse <b>planes...</b>|$|R

Serial sections were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled RNA riboprobes {{as described in}} Neubüser et al. (1995) with slight modifications. To identify the expression domain of Msx 1 in crocodile tissues, chicken Msx 1 antisense riboprobe was hybridized. Generally, hetero-specific RNA probes easily hybridize among reptilian lineages (Harris et al., 2006, Tokita et al., 2012). In this study, we only analyzed reptilian embryos at the ontogenetic stages where early cranial osteogenesis occurs. To confirm the expression pattern of each gene in the cranial tissues, two to five individuals representing each embryonic stage were sampled for analysis. The consistency of the gene expression patterns among all individual embryos at the same stage was confirmed. Multiple sections representing several <b>longitudinal</b> (anterior-posterior) <b>planes</b> prepared from the same individual were hybridized with the probes and the sections prepared at corresponding <b>longitudinal</b> <b>planes</b> were compared between different individuals.
