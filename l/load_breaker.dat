50|$|Vacuum interrupters can be {{classified}} by enclosure type, by application, and by voltage class. Experimental, radio frequency, and early power switching vacuum interrupters had glass enclosures. More recently, vacuum interrupters for power switch-gear are made with ceramic envelopes. Applications for vacuum interrupters include circuit <b>breakers,</b> <b>load</b> switches, motor contactors, and reclosers. Other special purpose types are also made (such as for use in transformer tap changers).|$|R
50|$|Since the arc {{is entirely}} {{contained}} within the interrupter, switch-gear using vacuum interrupters can be very compact compared with switch-gear using air or oil as the arc suppression medium. New metal-clad medium-voltage switch-gear now predominantly uses vacuum interrupters, and vacuum interrupter retrofits for air circuit breaker switch-gear are available. Vacuum interrupters {{can be used for}} circuit <b>breakers</b> and <b>load</b> switches. Circuit <b>breaker</b> vacuum interrupters are mainly used in the power sector in the substation and power grid facilities, while load switching vacuum interrupter is mainly used for power grid of the end user.|$|R
30|$|In this method, the {{transmission}} lines {{can be divided}} into two categories: terminal line and contact line. The terminal line is connected to the terminal <b>load</b> directly, and <b>breakers</b> and CTs are only installed {{at the beginning of the}} terminal line. Power flows from the bus to the terminal load via the terminal line. While for the contact line, it is connected between two buses and functions as a power exchanger with breakers and CTs installed on both ends of the line. Power flow direction in the contact line cannot be determined due to the connected intermittent DGs. In terms of the two-winding transformer, it can be considered as a special contact line connected between two buses with two different voltage levels.|$|R
50|$|Blue Coal's Huber Breaker was a {{landmark}} {{located in the}} borough of Ashley, Hanover Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, USA. The breaker was built in 1939 to replace the Maxwell Breaker which was located at the colliery. Run-of-mine coal arriving at the breaker was washed and cleaned to remove impurities, principally slate. It was crushed and screened to specific sizes desired by customers. Considered an ultra-modern plant when constructed, it used Menzies Cones to separate coal from waste. The breaker was operated by the Blue Coal Corporation, {{a subsidiary of the}} Glen Alden Coal Company. It processed 7,000 tons of Anthracite coal per day. The final product was sprayed with a blue dye and sold as “Blue Coal.” Railcars were <b>loaded</b> underneath the <b>breaker</b> and shipped to markets. The long decline of the anthracite industry after World War II caused Blue Coal to declare bankruptcy and cease operations in 1976.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Buildings are {{amongst the}} largest {{consumers}} of electrical energy in developed countries. Building efficiency {{can be improved}} by adapting building systems {{to a change in}} the environment or user context. Appropriate action, however, can only be taken if the building control system has access to reliable real-time data. Sensors providing this data need to be ubiquitous, accurate, have low maintenance cost, and should not violate privacy of building occupants. We conducted a three-year study in a mid-size office space with 15 offices and 25 people. Specifically, we focused on sensing modalities that can help improve energy efficiency of buildings. We have deployed 25 indoor climate sensor nodes and 41 wireless power meters, submetered 12 electric <b>loads</b> in circuit <b>breaker</b> boxes, logged data from our building control system and tracked activity on 40 desktop computers. We summarize our experiences with the cost, data yields, and user privacy concerns of the different sensing modalities and evaluate their accuracy using ground-truth experiments. ...|$|R
40|$|In many {{practical}} engineering applications, {{a significant}} portion of the available information is excluded from the design process due to a lack of obvious mechanisms for its incorporation. In this dissertation, several methods are presented for leveraging such underutilized prior knowledge in application-oriented settings. Three cases, motivated by real-world examples, are considered, addressing controller, estimator, and identification design respectively. In each case, a methodology is presented capturing the key features of the prior knowledge in a characterization which can be readily incorporated into standard solution. Firstly, a flexible modeling framework is presented for characterizing time-advanced forecast data associated with an exogenous disturbance. The model is incorporated into a disturbance-attenuating feedforward controller which can be synthesized with standard H 2 or H∞ methods. The closed-loop performance calculation provides a comparative metric to juxtapose multiple designs and address economic questions, such as sensor placement. A practical example is provided for a wind turbine and lidar sensor with tunable focus range. Secondly, a modeling framework is presented for characterizing logic-valued measurements that provide timely indication of an associated disturbance event. An estimator is constructed using the fast logic-valued measurement, and known disturbance statistics, to rapidly adjust the disturbance estimate, resulting in improved performance. The framework is applied to a gas turbine (GT) system with transient load disturbance associated with a fast electrical breaker switching measurement. The method is generalized to incorporate multiple disturbance <b>load</b> and <b>breaker</b> pairs. Finally, a high-fidelity GT (HFGT) model is used to construct a linear GT engine model for control design. The HFGT model generates closed-loop transient simulation data for system identification and the structure of its internal subsystems is leveraged to reduce the complexity of the identification process by excluding unnecessary subsystems. The partition of subsystems is enabled by access to signals in the high-fidelity model which are otherwise unavailable during physical engine testing. The resulting linear engine model can be modularly reconfigured with different fuel subsystem and rotor subsystem models. The linear GT model is validated in closed-loop transient simulations...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Electrical Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2014 In recent times, renewable energy-based distributed generation (DG) has captivated the industrial sector and {{on a global scale}} this has become a leading research area. Distributed generation using wind, solar energy or biomass as a source of energy can produce electricity on a small scale. Therefore, there is a strong focus on using renewable energy as a safe alternative source of energy, especially because it can in future play a dominant role in the world’s energy production and help to tackle the increase of global warming caused by fossil energy. However, a major problem facing renewable energies is that they are highly dependent on weather conditions. Since the power generated by DG, as well as consumption, depends on the weather conditions, irregularity of production and consumption leads to frequency and voltage fluctuations, and it can become difficult to determine and monitor consumer usage at any given time. Distributed generation can then be subjected to discrepancies in consumer usage and this can lead to severe overloading. As a result, microgrids powered by DG, operating in a single, stand-alone controllable system mode, face new challenges in terms of balancing a cluster of loads. Balancing a cluster of loads by making sure at all times that the entire system operates without overloading, is an essential requirement for the proper operation of a power system. The microgrid load considered in this project is the sum of sensitive and non-sensitive loads, respectively 5 kW and 100 kW, which constitute load requirement of one village; this total load required by a number of villages is called a cluster load. Depending on the input power generated by a DG-based photovoltaic (PV) system, these loads can be controlled using a logic control switch (LCS). When the power produced is less than the minimum load required by a component of a cluster, overloading occurs. The purpose of using an LCS is to ensure that a stable system is maintained under various loads and resource conditions. An LCS is used to continuously monitor and adjust <b>load</b> through circuit <b>breakers.</b> It is a good alternative to load balancing for a cluster of villages in rural area where a microgrid is operating in stand-alone mode. The focus of this research is to design a photovoltaic system with a maximum capacity of 1 MW providing power to a cluster of rural villages, and operating in stand-alone mode, and then to apply different control techniques (droop control, dq 0 reference frame + proportional integral (PI) controller, and PI controller alone) at the inverter terminal of the PV system, in order to evaluate the stability of the output voltage. Another goal of the research is to develop an energy management system (EMS) algorithm to support the PV system in reducing loads. Therefore, a iii stable system under various load and resource conditions, as well as suitable control mechanisms are required to model a PV system. There is a need for the modelling of a PV array using a physical modelling block in MATLAB (SIMULINK) software. The state flow provided by SIMULINK is used in this project to develop an algorithm for load balancing. The state flow gives possibilities of modelling complex algorithms by combining graphical and tabular representations to create sequential decision logic, derived from state transition diagrams and tables, flow charts and truth tables. Furthermore, the design of a microgrid using photovoltaic DG and an energy management system, has been developed. The present work mainly consists of a stand-alone microgrid operation, where the power generated must be equal to the load power. In addition, different control methods, consisting of a dq 0 reference frame + PI controller, are analysed at the invertor terminal. Subsequently an LCS algorithm is developed; this is required to maintain the system within certain limits and prevents overloading. LCS algorithms are based on a flowchart and allow switching automatically selected loads, depending on the power (solar radiation) available. In addition, a flow chart provides an easy way of using a graphical transition state and state chart to establish a set of rules for the system. The simulation results show that both droop control and a dq 0 reference frame + PI controller are much better than a PI controller alone; these results also compared well with similar studies found in the literature. Also, these results are further improved with an EMS {{in order to maintain the}} output voltage of the microgrid, by switching on and off certain loads depending on the input power. The modelling of the microgrid using DG, based on photovoltaic systems with a maximum capacity of 1 MW, supports and improves the PV system by reducing loads. Moreover, droop control, and dq 0 transformation + PI control present a better result than PI controller alone...|$|R
