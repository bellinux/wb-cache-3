2500|$|His antagonists, {{who usually}} {{appear in a}} single story each, are often parodies of science fiction, fantasy, and horror characters, and {{sometimes}} political figures, but include ordinary people simply making life difficult for Howard. The chief recurring villain, Lester Verde, better known as Doctor Bong – modeled on Doctor Doom and writers Bob Greene and Lester Bangs – is a former tabloid reporter who {{has the power to}} [...] "reorder reality" [...] by smashing himself on his bell-shaped helmet on his head; his main goal is to marry Beverly. After several issues, she agrees to marry him to save Howard from Bong's evil experimentation, and remains married to him for some time. Doctor Bong would reappear in issues of She-Hulk and Deadpool in the mid-1990s. Other recurring villains include the Kidney <b>Lady</b> (<b>S.</b> Blotte) who has been convinced by her former lover that the soul is in the kidneys and attacks anything she sees as a threat to them, and Reverend Jun Moon Yuc and his Yuccies, a parody of Reverend Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church [...] "Moonies". Another important villain was the organization S.O.O.F.I. (Save Our Offspring From Indecency), whose leader was implicitly Anita Bryant, though she looked like an old, fat Elvis Presley with a smiley face/orange on her head.|$|E

60|$|My cousin, Barbara Scott of Raeburn, {{came here}} to see <b>Lady</b> <b>S.</b> I think she was shocked with the melancholy change. She insisted upon walking back to Lessudden House, making her walk 16 or 18 miles, and though the {{carriage}} was ordered she would not enter it.|$|E

60|$|March 23.--Lady Scott arrived {{yesterday}} to dinner. She {{was better than}} I expected, but Anne, poor soul, looked very poorly, and had been much worried with the fatigue and discomfort of the last week. <b>Lady</b> <b>S.</b> takes the digitalis, and, as she thinks, with advantage, though the medicine makes her very sick. Yet, on the whole, things are better than my gloomy apprehensions had anticipated.|$|E

60|$|March 22.--A {{letter from}} Lord Downshire's man of {{business}} about funds supposed {{to belong to}} my wife, or to the estate of my late brother-in-law. The possessor of the secret wants some reward. If any is granted, {{it should be a}} percentage on the net sum received, with the condition no cure--no pay. I expect <b>Lady</b> <b>S.,</b> and from Anne's last letter hope to find her better than the first anticipation led me to dread.|$|E
60|$|There was a postscript, {{desiring}} that Jeanie would {{trust to}} <b>Lady</b> <b>S.</b> {{the management of}} their intercourse, and be content with assenting to what she should propose. After reading and again reading the letter, Mrs. Butler hurried down stairs, divided betwixt the fear of betraying her secret, {{and the desire to}} throw herself upon her sister's neck. Effie received her with a glance at once affectionate and cautionary, and immediately proceeded to speak.|$|E
6000|$|... [Abbotsford,] April 19.--Returned {{last night}} {{from the house}} of death and {{mourning}} to my own, now the habitation of sickness and anxious apprehension. Found <b>Lady</b> <b>S.</b> had tried the foxglove in quantity, till it made her so sick {{she was forced to}} desist. The result cannot yet be judged. Wrote to Mrs. Thomas Scott to beg her to let her daughter Anne, an uncommonly, sensible, steady, and sweet-tempered girl, come and stay with us a season in our distress, who I trust will come forthwith.|$|E

60|$|Dined quiet with <b>Lady</b> <b>S.</b> and Anne. Anne is practising Scots songs, which I take {{as a kind}} {{compliment}} to my own taste, as hers {{leads her}} chiefly to foreign music. I think the good girl sees that I want and must miss her sister's peculiar talent in singing the airs of our native country, which, imperfect as my musical ear is, make, and always have made, the most pleasing impression on me. And so if she puts a constraint on herself for my sake, I can only say, in requital, God bless her.|$|E
60|$|February 4.--Wrote to Mr. Laidlaw {{to come to}} town upon Monday and see the trustees. To farm or not to farm, that is the question. With our {{careless}} habits, it were best, I think, to risk {{as little}} as possible. Lady Scott will not exceed with ready money in her hand; but calculating on the produce of a farm is different, and neither she nor I are capable of that minute economy. Two cows should be all we should keep. But I find <b>Lady</b> <b>S.</b> inclines much for the four. If she had her youthful activity, and could manage things, it would be well, and would amuse her. But I fear {{it is too late}} a week.|$|E
60|$|March 19.--I have a most melancholy {{letter from}} Anne. <b>Lady</b> <b>S.,</b> the {{faithful}} and true companion of my fortunes, good and bad, {{for so many}} years, has, but with difficulty, been prevailed on to see Dr. Abercrombie, and his opinion is far from favourable. Her asthmatic complaints are fast terminating in hydropsy, as I have long suspected; yet the avowal of the truth and its probable consequences are overwhelming. They are to stay a little longer in town to try {{the effects of a}} new medicine. On Wednesday they propose to return hither--a new affliction, where there was enough before; yet her constitution is so good that if she will be guided by advice, things may be yet ameliorated. God grant it! for really these misfortunes come too close upon each other.|$|E

50|$|The genus Spiranthes {{contains}} about forty species, {{most of which}} are from North America. Some species are found in Central and South America, in temperate and tropical Asia southward to Australia and New Zealand. In Europe, three species occur in the wild. Besides the autumn lady's tresses, these are the summer <b>lady's</b> tresses <b>S.</b> aestivalis, and the Irish <b>lady's</b> tresses <b>S.</b> romanzoffiana, a mainly North American species that also occurs in Ireland and western Scotland. The autumn lady's tresses is easily distinguished because the two other species of previously have inflorescences that occur earlier during the year (May-July) from a living rosette, with lanceolate leaves rising at an angle and having cream-colored instead of greenish or greyish white flowers. The autumn lady's tresses also resembles the evergreen Goodyera repens (creeping lady's-tresses or dwarf rattlesnake plantain), which has a creeping rhizome rather than tubers. The inflorescence emerges from the centre of a rosette of ovate leaves with a pointed tip, and has striking perpendicular connective veins. The flowers are covered in long hairs that are often tipped with tiny droplets.|$|R

6000|$|March 15.--This morning I leave No. 39 Castle Street, for {{the last}} time. [...] "The cabin was convenient," [...] and habit had made it {{agreeable}} to me. I never reckoned upon a change in this particular so long as I held {{an office in the}} Court of Session. In all my former changes of residence it was from good to better; this is retrograding. I leave this house for sale, and I cease to be an Edinburgh citizen, in the sense of being a proprietor, which my father and I have been for sixty years at least. So farewell, poor 39, and may you never harbour worse people than those who now leave you! Not to desert the Lares all at once, <b>Lady</b> <b>S.</b> and Anne remain till Sunday. As for me, I go, as aforesaid, this morning.|$|E
60|$|December 30.--Spent at {{home and}} in labour--with the weight of {{unpleasant}} news from Edinburgh. J.B. is like to be pinched next week unless the loan can be brought forward. I must and have endeavoured to supply him. At present the result of my attempts is uncertain. I am even more anxious about C[onstable] & Co., unless they can get assistance from their London friends to whom they gave much. All is in God's hands. The worst can only be what I have before anticipated. But I must, I think, renounce the cigars. They brought back (using two this evening) the irritation of which I had no feelings while abstaining from them. Dined alone with Gordon,[106] <b>Lady</b> <b>S.,</b> and Anne. James Curle, Melrose, has handsomely lent me £600; he has done kindly. I have served him before and will again if in my power.|$|E
60|$|December 20.--I like Ch. Ba. Shepherd very much--- as much, I think, as any man I {{have learned}} to know of late years. There is a {{neatness}} and precision, a closeness and truth, {{in the tone of}} his conversation, which shows what a lawyer he must have been. Perfect good-humour and suavity of manner, with a little warmth of temper on suitable occasions. His great deafness alone prevented him from being Lord Chief-Justice. I never saw a man so patient under such a malady. He loves society, and converses excellently; yet is often obliged, in a mixed company particularly, to lay aside his trumpet, retire into himself, and withdraw from the talk. He does this with an expression of patience on his countenance which touches one much. He has occasion for patience otherwise, I should think, for <b>Lady</b> <b>S.</b> is fine and fidgety, and too anxious to have everything pointe devise.|$|E
