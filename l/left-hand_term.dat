Therefore, the inter-event interval of node i is strictly positive {{and has a}} lower bound τ_D^i, which is given as (41). To predict the next triggering time, each node only requires the states of itself and its neighbors at the last triggering time.|$|E
30|$|In Theorem  1, two event-triggered {{conditions}} (7) and (8) are proposed. At the triggering time t_k_i^i, the <b>left-hand</b> <b>term</b> κ_i(t_k_i^i)= 0. In (7), {{if there}} exists {{at least one}} node which does not synchronize with s(t), the right-hand term must be positive. Therefore, the next triggering time t_k_i+ 1 ^i must be greater than t_k_i^i. In (8), the right-hand term must be always positive for all nodes. Thus, the interevent intervals of all nodes are strictly positive. Although the two updating rules (7) and (8) {{are closely related to}} each other in some respects, the event-triggered condition in (8) is verified more easily than the condition in (7). Moreover, according to (16) and (19), the convergence under the event-triggered scheme (7) is better than under (8). The number of updating times under the event-triggered scheme (7) is more than (8).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formalism and {{a method to}} extract an executable and algebraic data type specification from a dynamic description. This formalism {{is based on an}} abstract description achieved through a finite state machine which has a double interpretation: i) it expresses the dynamic behaviour of a value, ii) it represents sub-domains of values with their operations. The axioms of the specification are computed in the following way: conditions and <b>left-hand</b> <b>terms</b> are produced from the finite state machine (following the AG-derivation principle), whereas right-hand conclusion terms are obtained by user interaction. This method yields some interesting properties: whenever termination is ensured, the specification is sufficiently complete and hierarchically consistent. Furthermore, the termination property is often reached applying some results from modular rewrite systems. The qualities of our approach are: abstract descriptions of values, consistency between dynamic and functiona [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Milner's {{complete}} proof {{system for}} observational congruence is crucially {{based on the}} possibility to equate divergent expressions to non-divergent ones {{by means of the}} axiom recX:(:X +E) = recX::E. In the presence of a notion of priority, where e. g. actions of type have a lower priority than silent actions, this axiom is no longer sound because a action performable by E is pre-empted in the <b>left-hand</b> <b>term</b> but not in the right-hand term. The problem of axiomatizing priority using the standard observational congruence has been open for a long time. Here we show that this can be done by introducing an auxiliary operator pri(E), by suitably modifying the axiom above and by introducing some new axioms. Our technique provides a complete axiomatization for Milner's observational congruence over nite-state terms of a process algebra with priority and recursion. 1 Introduction In the last years the expressiveness of classical process algebras has been extended in severa [...] ...|$|E
3000|$|The {{evaluation}} of the exact effect of the pseudorange error on cycle slip detection and fix is analytically demonstrated below. It {{can be seen in}} Eq. (1) that at epoch (k), the pseudorange measurements on both frequencies (P 1 and P 2 for the case of GPS) are required. If the pseudorange measurements P_ 1 ^p(k) [...] and P_ 2 ^p(k) [...] have SIPE, it may affect the cycle slip term in the left-hand side of Eq. (1). It is possible that at epoch (k- 1), the P_ 1 ^p(k- 1) [...] and P_ 2 ^p(k- 2) [...] may also have a SIPE relative to its previous epoch. It is not difficult to analyze from Eq. (1) that when both epochs (k) and (k- 1) have pseudorange SIPE of the same size, their impact on the <b>left-hand</b> <b>term</b> of Eq. (1) is actually cancelled. Therefore, it might be more precise to define the SIPE as the sudden increase of pseudorange error relative to its previous epoch.|$|E
5000|$|The occidental {{use of the}} <b>terms</b> <b>Left-Hand</b> Path and Right Hand-Path {{originated}} with Madame Blavatsky, a 19th-century occultist who founded the Theosophical Society. She had travelled across parts of southern Asia and claimed to have met with many mystics and magical practitioners in India and Tibet. She developed the <b>term</b> <b>Left-Hand</b> Path as a translation of the term Vamachara, an Indian Tantric practice that emphasised the breaking of Hindu societal taboos by having sexual intercourse in ritual, drinking alcohol, eating meat and assembling in graveyards, {{as a part of}} the spiritual practice.

50|$|In Western esotericism the <b>terms</b> <b>Left-Hand</b> Path and Right-Hand Path {{refer to}} a {{dichotomy}} between two opposing approaches to magic. This terminology is used in various groups involved in the occult and ceremonial magic. In some definitions, the Left-Hand Path is equated with malicious black magic and the Right-Hand Path with benevolent white magic. Other occultists have criticised this definition, believing that the Left-Right dichotomy refers merely to different kinds of working and does not necessarily connote good or bad magical actions.|$|R

50|$|Knitting {{with the}} yarn {{in the hand}} {{opposite}} the working needle (i.e. the left hand if the knitter is right-handed) is {{commonly referred to as}} Continental knitting, German knitting, European knitting, or <b>left-hand</b> knitting. The <b>term</b> 'left-hand knitting', however, is discouraged by left-handed knitters because it leads to misunderstandings. Unlike English knitting, the tip of the working needle is used to hook the yarn and bring it forward; the motion is thus sometimes known as picking. Continental knitting can be done at a greater rate than English knitting, as the stitches are formed closer to the needle points and the yarn has a shorter travel.|$|R
50|$|Tantra {{is a set}} of esoteric Indian traditions {{with roots}} in Hinduism and Buddhism. Tantra is often divided by its {{practitioners}} into two different paths: dakshinachara and vamachara, translated as Right-Hand Path and Left-Hand Path respectively. Dakshinachara consists of traditional Hindu practices such as asceticism and meditation, while vamachara also includes ritual practices that conflict with mainstream Hinduism, such as sexual rituals, consumption of alcohol and other intoxicants, animal sacrifice, and flesh-eating. The two paths are viewed by Tantrists as equally valid approaches to enlightenment. Vamachara, however, is often considered to be the faster and more dangerous of the two paths, and is not suitable for all practitioners. The usage of the <b>terms</b> <b>Left-Hand</b> Path and Right-Hand Path is still current in modern Indian and Buddhist Tantra.|$|R
40|$|A rewrite closure is an {{extension}} of a term rewrite system with new rules, usually deduced by transitivity. Rewrite closures have the nice property that all rewrite derivations can be transformed into derivations of a simple form. This property has been useful for proving decidability results in term rewriting. Unfortunately, when the term rewrite system is not linear, the construction of a rewrite closure is quite challenging. In this paper, we construct a rewrite closure for term rewrite systems that satisfy two properties: the right-hand side term in each rewrite rule contains no repeated variable (right-linear) and contains no variable occurring at depth greater than one (right-shallow). The <b>left-hand</b> side <b>term</b> is unrestricted, and in particular, it may be non-linear. As a consequence of the rewrite closure construction, we are able to prove decidability of the weak normalization problem for right-linear right-shallow term rewrite systems. Proving this result also requires tree automata theory. We use the fact that right-shallow right-linear term rewrite systems are regularity preserving. Moreover, their set of normal forms can be represented with a tree automaton with disequality constraints, and emptiness of this kind of automata, as well as its generalization to reduction automata, is decidable.

In effect, F is a procedural knowledge added to the declarative knowledge contained in the rule. The mechanism of CVPFs allows the user of McESE to treat uncertainty {{in the way he}} desires. The problems associated with correct specification of CVPFs led the authors to replace CVPFs by neural nets and &quot;train&quot; the resulting hybrid of rule-based expert system and neural nets. It was realized during the project that the ability to specify these neural nets from within the McESE system was crucial in order to carry out the needed tests and experiments. It turned out that the machinery of McESE (i. e. rule parser, rule compiler, and inference engine) after slight enhancements allows to simulate neural nets within McESE with any topology desired. In the paper these enhancements and their background are discussed. 1. Introduction.
