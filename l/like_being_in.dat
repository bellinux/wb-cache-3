It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided {{that the best thing}} to do was to leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, so in a way it would be <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident in the first week of June 1917.|$|E

25|$|In a {{relatively}} closely fought game at Chelmsford, the Essex team showed more resilience than the visitors, with nearly everyone chipping in {{to give the}} hosts {{a relatively}} comfortable victory. It started with a good bowling effort on the first day, after Ronnie Irani had chosen to put Leicestershire in. It nearly backfired, Darren Robinson and Darren Maddy easing their way to 98 for no loss, but the part-time medium pace of Essex number three Ravinder Bopara got Maddy out, resulting in a mini-collapse to 167 for 8. David Masters (27) and Phil DeFreitas (20) saved the innings somewhat, but Leicestershire's final total of 220 off 81 overs meant that Essex looked <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> the drivers' seat. Dale Steyn, the young South African pace bowler with three Test caps, took three for 69 on Essex debut, but Darren Gough was the pick of the bowlers with three for 46 - including Robinson, Paul Nixon for a golden duck and DeFreitas.|$|E

500|$|Moore {{stated that}} he found writing songs which {{combined}} progressive metal and electronic music easier than writing songs confined to one genre. [...] "There's people who do that better. Working with the two genres, they're different enough from each other – almost natural enemies – that it keeps it interesting," [...] he said. [...] "It doesn't feel <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> conquered territory, it feels like there's still room to explore.

500|$|Shunsuke Kosugi of Musica {{called the}} use of {{electronic}} beats on the album [...] "excellent", praised them as [...] "detailed" [...] and [...] "precise", and noted how they stirred up nostalgic feelings that [...] "pulled at the heartstrings". Kosugi {{felt that there was}} a uniformity to the beats on the album, and stressed that listeners should listen to the work as a whole to experience this properly. Reviewers for So-en praised the album for Yamaguchi's vocals and Sakanaction's atypical band sound, feeling that listening to the album created a [...] "floating feeling <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> space". They further praised Yamaguchi's [...] "unique" [...] lyrical worldview, and the high level of perfection found in the recordings.|$|E

He thought that it was a value for money option and was the [...] "first real stab at giving passengers a choice while they are flying." [...] Chris Haslam reviewed a number of in-flight meal options on various airlines as well as Plane Food in an article for the Sunday Times.

In an interview with MTV News, Gaga said that [...] "Monster" [...] describes her fear of sex and relationships and the literal meaning is about a [...] "guy with a big dick". She elaborated, [...] "It's the fear of attachment {{and the fear of}} loving something that's bad for you... If you listen to the lyrics, it's <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> love with the bad boy all the time, and you keep going back for more." [...] Gaga added that the fear in [...] "Monster" [...] erupted from her need to have a stable relationship. [...] "I keep falling in love with the monster... But what I really need is the security and the safety and the womanhood, responsibility of my femininity. And so that's what that song is about.|$|E
500|$|Many of the tributes paid to Davies {{after his}} death {{acknowledged}} his commitment to Merthyr and the mining communities of the Welsh valleys, {{for which he was}} an unfailing advocate. The mayor of Merthyr remarked that he was [...] "an individualist who followed the teaching of 'Love thy neighbour as thyself'. He was highly respected by all, even by those who didn't agree with him". His parliamentary colleague and fellow mineworker Jim Griffiths, who had shared with Davies the leadership of the South Wales miners after the 1926 general strike, thought that had Davies cultivated an ability for compromise, he would have achieved ministerial office. But [...] "he always was a lone figure... and seemed to <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> isolation." [...] In April 2013 a heritage plaque in Davies's honour was unveiled at Penydarren Park, Merthyr Tydfil. On 5 August 2015, as part of the De Montfort Project celebrating the 750th anniversary of Simon de Montfort's parliament, Davies's parliamentary work was recognised in special events at Cardiff and Merthyr Tydfil.|$|E

[...] Bourdon said the album was a {{challenge}} to complete; he said, [...] "We've been making music for a long time so one of the challenges was to evolve and make something to keep us interested and also {{have a lot of fun}} in the process. We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging." [...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, and in the middle of the process, we were contemplating whether or not that was what we wanted to do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} well {{received}} by Japanese music critics, and {{was chosen as}} one of the eleven finalists for the 2011 CD Shop Awards. Toshitomo Doumei of Skream! named the album his third favorite of 2011, feeling that the album had simultaneously created new genres of alternative rock and pop music. He felt the album's music was catchy, and that its success was expected due to its high quality. Entertainment Media Kulture called Kikuuiki the album that established Sakanaction's current style. Yuji Tanaka of CDJournal felt the album was more cohesive than their previous works, praising the band's skill progression and Yamaguchi's lyrics, which he described as [...] "literary-style" [...] and [...] "cynical". He was struck by the [...] "heroic march" [...] after the album's introduction in the song [...] "Ushio", which made him feel [...] "suddenly intoxicated... <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> the ocean". Takayuki Endoh of Skream! similarly believed the album showed growth in the band. Although their previous releases incorporated dance and rock music, Endoh felt that the music on Kikuuiki had struck a better harmony between the two, and had simultaneously become more rock and dance–oriented. He praised the album's [...] "poppy floating feeling, highly literary lyrics, and romantic electro sound", feeling that the band was unique in the music industry.|$|E
500|$|The Stone Tape remains well-regarded to this day. [...] Roger Fulton, {{writing in}} The Encyclopedia of TV Science Fiction, calls it [...] "arguably the most creepy drama {{ever seen on}} television". The writer and critic Kim Newman regards it as [...] "one of the masterpieces of genre television, an {{authentic}} alliance of mind-stretching science fiction concepts with horror and suspense plot mechanics". Writer and member of The League of Gentlemen, Jeremy Dyson feels that The Stone Tape [...] "strikes a note that it just circumnavigates your intellect and gets you on a much deeper level [...] it just has this impact on you, rather <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> the room itself. Extraordinary piece of work". [...] Writer Grant Morrison recalled The Stone Tape as [...] "really creepy and very memorable. Just brilliant images. That {{scared the hell out}} of me!". Sergio Angelini, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, has said that [...] "The Stone Tape stands as perhaps his finest single work in the genre". Lez Cooke, in his book British Television Drama: A History, has praised the play as [...] "one of the most imaginative and intelligent examples of the horror genre to appear on British television, a single play to rank alongside the best of Play for Today".|$|E
500|$|Possessed of {{a strong}} intelligence, McCain did well in a few {{subjects}} that interested him, such as English literature, history, and government. [...] There was a fixed Bachelor of Science curriculum taken by all midshipmen; [...] McCain's classmates were impressed by his cramming abilities on mathematics, science, and engineering courses and thought his low grades were by inclination and not ability, while McCain would later acknowledge that those courses were a struggle for him. [...] His class rank was further lowered by poor grades for conduct and leadership, which reflected his sloppy appearance, rebellious attitude, and poor relations with his company officer. [...] Despite his low standing, he was popular and a leader among his fellow midshipmen, in what biographer Robert Timberg called a [...] "manic, intuitive, highly idiosyncratic way". Good at attracting women, he was famed for organizing off-Yard activities with a group who called themselves [...] "the Bad Bunch"; one classmate said that [...] "being on liberty with John McCain was <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> a train wreck." [...] Other midshipmen were annoyed by his behavior. [...] A June 1957 training cruise aboard the destroyer [...] found McCain showing good skills at the conn, and the destination stop in Rio de Janeiro led to a dream-like romance with Brazilian fashion model and ballerina Maria Gracinda that persisted through a Christmastime reunion.|$|E

500|$|Drury {{commanded}} Neptune for {{the next}} two years, until his promotion to rear-admiral in 1804. He departed the ship on 13 May 1804, and the following day Captain Sir Thomas Williams took over. Neptune spent the rest of 1804 deployed with the Channel Fleet, blockading the French Atlantic ports. During this time Captain Williams' health progressively worsened, and he was invalided back to Britain on 7 May 1805. He was replaced by Captain Thomas Fremantle on 8 May, and was sent to join Robert Calder's force blockading Ferrol, after the Franco-Spanish fleet had arrived there after the Battle of Cape Finisterre. Calder decided that his eight ships were not sufficient to resist Villeneuve's fleet were it to come out of harbour, and instead went north to join Admiral William Cornwallis's fleet off Brest. Shortly afterwards Nelson's fleet returned from the West Indies, bringing 12 more ships, and Calder was given 18 ships, including Neptune, and sent back to Ferrol to search for Villeneuve. By now Villeneuve had put into Cadiz and Calder's force was ordered to join the hastily assembled British fleet under Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, that was blockading the Franco-Spanish fleet at Cadiz. As the British fleet settled in for a long blockade Fremantle commented on Neptunes sailing qualities. She had the reputation of being slow, and Fremantle complained that he did not <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> 'a large ship that don't sail and must continually be late in action.' During the battle however, Midshipman William Baddock commented that 'The old Neptune, which never was a good sailer, took it into her head that morning to sail better than I ever remember to have seen her do before.' Neptune [...] went into the battle 18 men short of her complement.|$|E
