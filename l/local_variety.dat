5|$|Khubeza, a <b>local</b> <b>variety</b> of the mallow plant, {{became an}} {{important}} food source during the War of Independence. During the siege of Jerusalem, when convoys of food could not reach the city, Jerusalemites {{went out to the}} fields to pick khubeza leaves, which are high in iron and vitamins. The Jerusalem radio station, Kol Hamagen, broadcast instructions for cooking it that were picked up in Jordan convinced the Arabs that the Jews were dying of starvation and victory was at hand. In the past decade, food writers in Israel have encouraged the population to prepare khubeza on Israel Independence Day. Local chefs have begun to serve khubeza and other wild plants gathered from the fields in upscale restaurants.|$|E
5|$|Mandarin and Malay, in particular, the <b>local</b> <b>variety</b> of Malay, that is, Sarawakian Malay or Bahasa Sarawak, {{are widely}} spoken here. English is spoken to some extent, with most Mirians being {{incapable}} of speaking English with impeccable grammar. The respective ethnic groups also speak their own languages. Indigenous groups speak languages such as Berawan, Bruneian/Kedayan, Miriek, Iban, Bidayuh, Kayan, Kenyah, and Kelabit. Meanwhile, the Chinese would speak Mandarin, Hakka Chinese, Cantonese, Teochew dialect, Hainanese, and the Fuzhou dialect. However, {{the younger generation}} in Miri tends to use lingua francas (Mandarin and Malay) rather than their indigenous languages (such as Kayan and Kelabit), {{with the exception of}} Iban, which is widely used here, or Chinese dialects (Hokkien and Foochow), and an effort has been made to promote the usage of indigenous languages among the younger generation.|$|E

The similarity (similarity) among 22 <b>local</b> <b>varieties</b> of rice South Sumatra became one of the obstacles for scientists to develop rice varieties. One solution to this problem is to determine the genetic relatedness between 22 rice local vaietas South Sumatra. Identification of genetic relatedness among 22 <b>local</b> <b>varieties</b> of rice South Sumatra can be carried out using PCR-RAPD. This study aims to determine the phylogenetic relationship among 22 <b>local</b> <b>varieties</b> of rice South Sumatra.

30|$|Cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) {{is derived}} from Asian wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff). Vietnamese <b>local</b> <b>varieties</b> and wild natural populations in Vietnam and Myanmar were {{examined}} to evaluate the levels of genetic variation in cultivated and wild rice. In total, 222 Vietnamese <b>local</b> <b>varieties</b> were analyzed with ten microsatellite markers. Using marker genotype and gene diversity data, the <b>local</b> <b>varieties</b> were differentiated based on geographical distribution, cropping season, and human preference. A total of 976 wild plants were collected at six natural sites of wild populations (three each in Myanmar and Vietnam), and the degrees of variation among populations were analyzed with five microsatellite markers. Phylogenetic analyses revealed wide genetic differentiation among wild populations. The diversity values detected in a single wild population in Vietnam were higher than those in whole Vietnamese <b>local</b> <b>varieties.</b> These results indicate that wild rice has much greater genetic variation than cultivated rice.|$|R

25|$|The Protestant Reformation led by Huldrych Zwingli made Zürich both a {{theological}} centre and a stronghold of Protestantism in Switzerland.

Zürich attracted other influential Protestant Reformers like Heinrich Bullinger. Zwingli translated the Bible (Zürich Bible) into the <b>local</b> <b>variety</b> of German and introduced the Reformation by winning support of the magistrates, the princess abbess Katharina von Zimmern and the largely peasant population of the Canton of Zürich.

40|$|The {{influence}} of NPK fertilizer on the incidence, severity and gravity of cassava mosaic disease (CMD) was investigated using eight genetically improved cassava <b>varieties</b> and eight <b>local</b> farmer’s <b>varieties.</b> The study {{was carried out}} in a savannah region (Gandajika) in D. R. Congo at two locations. The varieties were planted with and without NPK fertilization. Application of NPK fertilizer significantly (P< 0. 05) increased CMD incidence, severity (AUDPC) and gravity overtime compared to the trials without fertilizers for all the improved cassava varieties evaluated. The CMD incidence remained below 30 % of infected plants for improved cassava varieties and reached 100 % of plants for <b>local</b> <b>varieties</b> during the six months trial. The same trend was observed for CMD gravity (number of infected leaves per plant) that was below 50 % for improved varieties while reaching 100 % for all the <b>local</b> <b>varieties</b> at 6 MAP.

500|$|Einar Haugen {{expanded}} the diaphonic {{approach to the}} study of bilingualism, believing diaphones represented the process of interlingual identification wherein sounds from different languages are perceptually linked into a single category. [...] Because interlingual identifications may happen between unrelated varieties, it is possible to construct a diasystem for many different language contact situations, with the appropriateness of such a construction depending on its purpose and its simplicity depending on how isomorphic the phonology of the systems are. [...] For example, the Spanish of Los Ojos (a small village in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico) and the <b>local</b> <b>variety</b> of Southwestern English are fairly isomorphic with each other so a diaphonic approach for such a language contact situation would be relatively straightforward. [...] makes use of a diaphonic approach [...] in discussing the phonology of the pidgin English used by Japanese immigrants on Hawaiian plantations.|$|E
