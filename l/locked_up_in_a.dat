Among them was Dr. Vesna Bosanac, the director of the town's hospital, who was regarded as a heroine in Croatia but demonised by the Serbian media. She and her husband were taken to Sremska Mitrovica prison, where she was <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single room with 66 other women for several weeks. Her husband was subjected to repeated beatings. After appeals from the International Committee of the Red Cross, the couple were eventually released in a prisoner exchange. Croatian Radio journalist Siniša Glavašević, whose broadcasts had become iconic in Croatia, was taken to Ovčara, severely beaten and shot along with the other victims of the massacre.|$|E

25|$|In September 2007, an {{immigration}} judge in Los Angeles cited the United Nations Convention Against Torture in ruling that Gambino {{should not be}} deported. The judge found that in Italy, Gambino would probably be <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> harsh, life-threatening and life-shortening prison system designed to compel inmates to reveal information about the Sicilian Mafia (see article 41-bis prison regime). Similar reasoning was used to prevent his brothers from being deported after their criminal convictions. Immigration and Customs Enforcement successfully appealed the ruling.|$|E

25|$|Gustl Ferdinand Mollath (born 7 November 1956 in Nuremberg) is a German man who {{was acquitted}} during a {{criminal}} trial in 2006 {{on the basis of}} diminished criminal responsibility; he was committed to a high-security psychiatric hospital, as the court deemed him a danger to the public and declared him insane based on expert diagnoses of paranoid personality disorder. Mollath's forensic incarceration for seven years and the surrounding legal judgments became the basis of a public controversy in Bavaria and the whole of Germany when at least some underlying elements of his supposedly fabricated paranoid story about money-laundering activities at a major bank turned out to be true after all. Mollath himself had consistently claimed there was a conspiracy to have him <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> psychiatric care ward because of his incriminating knowledge; evidence turned up in 2012 made his claims appear plausible.|$|E

25|$|Around 04:00 on 9 April 1940, M-1 and M-9 sighted Egersund. While M-9 {{remained}} off {{the port}} the secure the surrounding waters, the more manoeuvrable M-1, carrying Rittmeister Eickhorn and 40 troops, entered Egersund harbour. At 04:15 the Germans landed near the moored Skarv, the guard {{on board the}} Norwegian vessel initially believing M-1 to be Gyller returning from Kristiansand. The torpedo boat was quickly boarded and seized by the German troops. After their capture, the crew of Skarv managed to destroy maps and important documents, as well as making a telephone call to the regional naval headquarters in Kristiansand. Before long, the captured Norwegian naval personnel were <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shed under armed guard. After arriving in Egersund, Captain Dehli had established contact with Skarv, intending to coordinate his dispositions with the naval vessel.

25|$|The post-Kakatiya period saw the {{emergence}} of Vijayanagara Empire {{as well as the}} Reddy dynasty. Initially, the two kingdoms were <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> territorial struggle for supremacy in the coastal region of Andhra. Later, they united and became allies against their common archrivals—the Bahmani sultans and the Recherla Velamas of Rachakonda who had formed an alliance. This political alliance between Vijayanagara and the Reddy kingdom was cemented further by a matrimonial alliance. Harihara II of Vijayanagara gave his daughter in marriage to Kataya Vema Reddy’s son Kataya. The Reddy rulers exercised a policy of annexation and invasion of Kalinga (modern day Odisha). However, the suzerainty of Kalinga rulers was to be recognised. In 1443 CE, determined {{to put an end to}} the aggressions of the Reddy kingdom, the Gajapati ruler Kapilendra of Kalinga formed an alliance with the Velamas and launched an attack on the Reddy kingdom. Veerabhadra Reddy allied himself with Vijayanagara ruler Devaraya II and defeated Kapilendra. After the death of Devaraya II in 1446 CE, he was succeeded by his son, Mallikarjuna Raya. Overwhelmed by difficulties at home, Mallikarjuna Raya recalled the Vijayanagara forces from Rajahmundry. Veerabhadra Reddy died in 1448 CE. Seizing this opportunity, Kapilendra sent an army under the leadership of his son Hamvira into the Reddy kingdom, took Rajahmundry and gained control of the Reddy kingdom. The Gajapatis eventually lost control after the death of Kapilendra, and the territories of the former Reddy kingdom came under the control of the Vijayanagara Empire.|$|E
25|$|In {{the film}} X-Men, Magneto is a {{powerful}} mutant whose abilities have become near limitless. He is the main antagonist of the film. But the existence of mutants have become public {{and the subject of}} a fierce debate over whether or not to be granted the same rights as others humans or whether they should be separated all together. The US Senate is debating a Mutant Registration Act to force all mutants to reveal themselves and be registered, a move sponsored by Senator Robert Kelly. Magneto is present the day when attempts to convince the Senate to vote against mutant registration but is shouted down by Senator Kelly. When confronted by his old friend, Charles Xavier, he tells him that he had seen and heard the same speeches before, when the Nazis had cried out against Jews. He then asks that Xavier does not get in his way as he tries to ensure mutant supremacy. Magneto attempts to mutate the world leaders with a high-tech machine powered by his own magnetic energy installed on the Statue of Liberty's torch. As the machine is potentially lethal, he kidnaps Rogue to use as the power source instead. Unknown to Magneto, the machine would cause humans to be killed by losing their molecular structure (as seen in Senator Kelly). Even when warned of the dangers of the machine by Jean Grey and Storm, Magneto does not believe them nor does he care. In the end, while Wolverine attacks Magneto atop the torch Cyclops uses an optic blast to knock down Magneto and destroy the machine. Magneto ends <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> plastic prison.|$|E
