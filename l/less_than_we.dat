Oden taught that Judaism never read the story as Original Sin or the Fall of Man, but as just one more instance of human beings getting into trouble, and God rescuing them and giving them another chance.|$|E

6000|$|... § 56. Far-fetched {{though this}} idea will perhaps be thought, a little introspection will countenance it. That we do take {{advantage}} of metrical language to adjust our perceptive faculties to {{the force of the}} expected articulations, is clear from {{the fact that we are}} balked by halting versification. Much as at the bottom of a flight of stairs, a step more or <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> counted upon gives us a shock; so, too, does a misplaced accent or a supernumerary syllable. In the one case, we know that there is an erroneous preadjustment; and we can scarcely doubt that there is one in the other. But if we habitually preadjust our perceptions to the measured movement of verse, the physical analogy above given renders it probable that by so doing we economize attention; and hence that metrical language is more effective than prose, because it enables us to do this.|$|E
