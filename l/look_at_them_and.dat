500|$|Dylan {{composed}} {{this song}} {{in the form of}} a 12-bar blues. In the sleeve notes of Freewheelin, Dylan explained to Nat Hentoff: [...] "What made the real blues singers so great is that they were able to state all the problems they had; but at the same time, they were standing outside of them and could <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> <b>And</b> in that way, they had them beat." [...] Into this song, Dylan injected one explicit mention of an absence that was troubling him: the sojourn of Suze Rotolo in Perugia: [...] "My baby took my heart from me/ She packed it all up in a suitcase/ Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1888 Francis {{developed}} diphtheria {{and died}} on 11 September. Overwhelmed with grief, Pankhurst commissioned two {{portraits of the}} dead boy {{but was unable to}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> hid them in a bedroom cupboard. The family concluded that a faulty drainage system at the back of their house had caused their son's illness. Pankhurst blamed the poor conditions of the neighbourhood, and the family moved to a more affluent middle class district at Russell Square. She was soon pregnant once more and declared that the child was [...] "Frank coming again." [...] She gave birth to a son on 7 July 1889 and named him Henry Francis in honour of his deceased brother.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} in Foo Fighters are {{nonsensical}} lines written by Grohl in the 20 minutes before recording began. As the frontman, Grohl explained, [...] "I had seven days to record fifteen songs. I was just concentrating on everything being as together as possible, having everything be tight and in sync. There wasn't too much time spent {{sitting in a chair}} thinking." [...] Grohl would add that the gibberish was deliberate, given that, [...] "there was too much to say," [...] following Cobain's death and, [...] "a lot of emphasis placed on the meaning of the first Foo Fighters album." [...] Grohl still considered that [...] "the things you write down spur of the moment are most revealing. Now I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> some of them seem to actually have meaning", and revealed that a few songs have lyrics inspired by [...] "personal experiences of {{the last four or five}} years", with the standout being [...] "Big Me", an [...] "out-and-out love song" [...] to Grohl's then-wife Jennifer Youngblood that he described as his favorite track on the album. Contrasting with the aggressive and rebellious themes of Nirvana, Grohl had positive and cheery tunes such as [...] "This Is a Call", defined as [...] "a 'hello' and a 'thank you'" [...] to everyone that had played a key role in Grohl's life; the playful [...] "For All the Cows"; and [...] "Wattershed", with a title referencing Mike Watt and lyrics that described Grohl's [...] "love of hardcore and old school punk rock".|$|E

60|$|SHE [spiritlessly, {{taking the}} flowers without <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> temporizing] Teddy isn't in yet.|$|R
60|$|Silently {{the four}} boy hunters raised their firearms. Shep <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> then along {{the barrel of}} his piece.|$|R
2500|$|The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer {{taught that}} when Joseph rode in his chariot (as {{described}} in [...] ), the Egyptian girls {{climbed up the}} walls {{to see him and}} threw him rings of gold so that he might <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> they could see the beauty of his figure.|$|E
2500|$|The jazz {{pianist and}} {{educator}} Kenny Barron commented, [...] "I have every record [...] ever made—and I try never {{to listen to}} them ... If I did, I'd throw up my hands and give up!" [...] Jean Cocteau dubbed Tatum [...] "a crazed Chopin". Count Basie called him the eighth wonder of the world. [...] Dave Brubeck observed, [...] "I don't think there's any more chance of another Tatum turning up than another Mozart." [...] Pianist Mulgrew Miller, commented on personal growth by saying, [...] "When I talk to the people I admire, they're always talking about continuous growth and development and I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> say, 'Well... what are YOU going to do?' But, as Harold Mabern says, 'There's always Art Tatum records around'". Dizzy Gillespie said, [...] "First you speak of Art Tatum, then take a long deep breath, and you speak of the other pianists." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harris {{approached}} another {{table where}} two girls were hiding. He {{bent down to}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> dismissed them as [...] "pathetic". Harris then moved to another table where he fired twice, injuring 16-year-olds Nicole Nowlen and John Tomlin. When Tomlin attempted {{to move away from}} the table, Klebold kicked him. Harris then taunted Tomlin's attempt at escape before Klebold shot the youth repeatedly, killing him. Harris then walked back over to the other side of the table where Lauren Townsend lay dead. Behind the table, a 16-year-old girl named Kelly Fleming had, like Bree Pasquale, sat next to the table rather than beneath it due to a lack of space. Harris shot Fleming with his shotgun, hitting her in the back and killing her instantly. He shot at the table behind Fleming, hitting Townsend and Kreutz again, and wounding 18-year-old Jeanna Park. An autopsy later revealed that Townsend died from the earlier gunshots inflicted by Klebold.|$|E
60|$|And he rose up {{from his}} feet, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> lo! they were a King and a Queen.|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> {{it seemed}} as though imps were {{twitching}} the muscles of his face. He looked his question.|$|R
60|$|Emma stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>'em,</b> <b>and</b> {{then she}} patted 'er {{eyes with a}} pocket- 'ankercher and began to look more cheerful.|$|R
6000|$|... "And the vegetables! <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them!</b> <b>And</b> {{the flowers}} growing along the borders! That beats tomato plants in {{wrapping}} paper." ...|$|E
6000|$|Both Crayford and Steventon hesitated. Mrs. Crayford cast one indignant <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> {{told the}} {{necessary}} lie, without a moment's hesitation! ...|$|E
60|$|Let us {{drop in on}} them, good reader, at a later period, have a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> bid {{them all}} good-bye.|$|E
6000|$|... "He seems rather sweet upon Miss Amory," [...] {{the gentleman}} went on. Laura <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> perhaps thought so too, but said nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "The toll {{woman stood}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> smiled. She was a {{pleasant}} personage, not inclined to worry over the misfortunes of her fellow-beings.|$|R
6000|$|And {{after that}} they had unrobed him, he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> said, 'What are the flowers that stand on the altar, and whence do they come?' ...|$|R
60|$|And my {{knuckles}} are {{sore and}} swollen. I cease writing {{for a moment}} to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> to hope that they will not stay permanently enlarged.|$|E
60|$|As {{he did so}} the two Boers came in, and one of {{them made}} some sneering remark that caused the other to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> laugh insultingly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} will. Take a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> you 'll change your mind," [...] {{answered}} Polly, tapping at a door, on which two modest cards were tacked.|$|E
60|$|Neither of 'em {{answered}} 'er, but {{the next}} night they both turned up as usual, and Emma White stood there <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>'em</b> <b>and</b> nearly crying with temper.|$|R
60|$|Old Sam turned 'is face round <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>'em,</b> <b>and</b> if <b>looks</b> could ha' killed, as {{the saying}} is, they'd ha' been dead men there and then.|$|R
60|$|Miss Hartley <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>at</b> {{the work}} done and the heap of plants still to go in. She stood tapping the ground thoughtfully with her foot.|$|R
6000|$|Billy This, who {{was smoking}} his cigar on the veranda, {{immediately}} ran and called Harry That to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> laid a bet {{at once that}} Lillie had [...] "hooked" [...] Seymour.|$|E
6000|$|He {{waved his}} hand towards the {{squatting}} negroes. [...] "Señores," [...] he said turning to the officers, [...] "I would ask you to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> tell me if the thing appears reasonable." ...|$|E
6000|$|Margaret squealed in delight. [...] "Girls, look here. Valentines! Did you ever?... <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them....</b> <b>And</b> what's this?... 'Wonders of Nature--composition by Margaret Maynard.' Heavens! Did I write that? And what's this sear {{and yellow}} document?" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the maid}} without {{touching}} or even <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> with a cry, I want no jewels! started {{to her feet}} so {{that they were all}} scattered upon the floor.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Turnbull <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> {{the circle}} of {{intelligent}} faces grew misty before his angry eyes. One man, ignoring his sodden condition, recommended a wet handkerchief tied round his brow.|$|R
50|$|A Hindu mythology text, the Kalki Purana, {{mentions}} {{that they can}} kill a person just by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> talks about a Visha Kanya named Sulochana, {{the wife of a}} Gandharva, Chitragreeva.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I often <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> wish I {{could see}} the low {{sunlight}} on the stems again. But I have never been that way but once,--to the churchyard with my mother." ...|$|E
60|$|No one {{dared to}} tell him the dark {{predictions}} of the great oculist who came to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> the boy tried to be patient, thinking that a few weeks of rest would repair the overwork of several years.|$|E
60|$|I took but one <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> ducked {{again into}} my place. It was strange indeed {{to see this}} valley, which had lain so solitary in the hour of dawn, bristling with arms and dotted with the red coats and breeches.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I thanked my stars my buttonholes were nice, for she <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> said: [...] "Quite workmanlike, upon my word," [...] added another, {{feeling that}} her gingham gown {{had come to}} honour.|$|R
5000|$|The real Olli and Raija Mäki appear {{briefly at}} the very end of the film, as Raija <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> asks Olli [...] "Do you think we'll be like them when we're old?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{appear to}} be as well {{as if nothing had}} {{happened}} to them," [...] replied Hamilton. [...] "I've been <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> there is no mark whatever. They do not even feel tender." ...|$|R
