5|$|In 1666, Newton {{observed}} that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism {{in the position of}} minimum deviation is oblong, even when the <b>light</b> <b>ray</b> entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles. This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light—a point which had been debated in prior years.|$|E
5|$|A <b>light</b> <b>ray</b> {{emanating from}} the source S is {{reflected}} by a beam splitter G and is collimated into a parallel beam by lens L. After passing the slits O1 and O2, two rays of light travel through the tubes A1 and A2, through which water is streaming {{back and forth as}} shown by the arrows. The rays reflect off a mirror m at the focus of lens L, so that one ray always propagates {{in the same direction as}} the water stream, and the other ray opposite to the direction of the water stream. After passing back and forth through the tubes, both rays unite at S, where they produce interference fringes that can be visualized through the illustrated eyepiece. The interference pattern can be analyzed to determine the speed of light traveling along each leg of the tube.|$|E
5|$|Geometrical optics {{provides}} further matrix applications. In this approximative theory, {{the wave}} nature of light is neglected. The {{result is a}} model in which light rays are indeed geometrical rays. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, the action of a lens or reflective element on a given <b>light</b> <b>ray</b> can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the optical axis, while the matrix encodes {{the properties of the}} optical element. Actually, {{there are two kinds of}} matrices, viz. a refraction matrix describing the refraction at a lens surface, and a translation matrix, describing the translation of the plane of reference to the next refracting surface, where another refraction matrix applies.|$|E
50|$|Starlight also {{follows the}} inverse square law. <b>Light</b> <b>rays</b> leave the star in equal amounts in all directions. The <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> create a sphere of light {{surrounding}} the star. As time progresses, the sphere grows as the <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> travel through space {{away from the}} star. While the sphere of light grows, the number of <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> stays the same. So, the amount of light per unit of surface area of the sphere (called flux in astronomy) decreases with distance and therefore time. When observing a star, only the <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> {{that are in the}} given area being viewed can be detected. This is why a star appears dimmer the farther away it is.|$|R

5|$|In the 1960s, Ehlers {{collaborated with}} Felix Pirani and Alfred Schild on a constructive-axiomatic {{approach}} to general relativity: {{a way of}} deriving the theory from a minimal set of elementary objects {{and a set of}} axioms specifying these objects' properties. The basic ingredients of their approach are primitive concepts such as event, <b>light</b> <b>ray,</b> particle and freely falling particle. At the outset, spacetime is a mere set of events, without any further structure. They postulated the basic properties of light and freely falling particles as axioms, and with their help constructed the differential topology, conformal structure and, finally, the metric structure of spacetime, that is: the notion of when two events are close to each other, the role of light rays in linking up events, and a notion of distance between events. Key steps of the construction correspond to idealized measurements, such the standard range finding used in radar. The final step derived Einstein's equations from the weakest possible set of additional axioms. The result is a formulation that clearly identifies the assumptions underlying general relativity.|$|E
25|$|Now we {{only need}} to compute the {{intersection}} of the latter ray with our field of view, to get the pixel which our reflected <b>light</b> <b>ray</b> will hit. Lastly, this pixel is set to an appropriate color, taking into account how the color of the original light source and the one of the sphere are combined by the reflection.|$|E
25|$|As {{observed}} by Lord Rayleigh, {{a thin film}} (such as tarnish) {{on the surface of}} glass can reduce the reflectivity. This effect can be explained by envisioning a thin layer of material with refractive index n1 between the air (index n0) and the glass (index nS). The <b>light</b> <b>ray</b> now reflects twice: once from the surface between air and the thin layer, and once from the layer-to-glass interface.|$|E

Following a patch {{on the surface of}} the sphere with area A, fewer <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> pass through that patch as the light travels further from the star.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} technique to render single scattering in large scenes with reflective and refractive objects and homogeneous participating media. Efficiency is obtained by evaluating the final radiance along a viewing ray {{directly from the}} <b>lighting</b> <b>rays</b> passing near to it, and by rapidly identifying such <b>lighting</b> <b>rays</b> in the scene. To facilitate the search for nearby <b>lighting</b> <b>rays,</b> we convert <b>lighting</b> <b>rays</b> and viewing rays into 6 D points and planes according to their Plücker coordinates and coefficients, respectively. In this 6 D line space, the problem of closest lines search becomes one of closest points to a plane query, which we significantly accelerate using a spatial hierarchy of the 6 D points. This approach to <b>lighting</b> <b>ray</b> gathering supports complex light paths with multiple reflections and refractions, and avoids {{the use of a}} volume representation, which is expensive for large-scale scenes. This method also utilizes far fewer <b>lighting</b> <b>rays</b> than the number of photons needed in traditional volumetric photon mapping, and does not discretize viewing rays into numerous steps for ray marching. With this approach, results similar to volumetric photon mapping are obtained efficiently in terms of both storage and computation...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{solar cell}} design is described. A surface of each solar cell has {{a plurality of}} grooves. Each groove has a vertical face and a slanted face that is covered by a reflecting metal. <b>Light</b> <b>rays</b> are reflected from the slanted face through the vertical face where they traverse a photovoltaic junction. As the <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> travel to the slanted face of an adjacent groove, they again traverse the junction. The underside of the reflecting coating directs the <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> toward the opposite surface of solar cell as they traverse the junction again. When the <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> travel through the solar cell and reach the saw toothed grooves on the under side, the process of reflection and repeatedly traversing the junction again takes place. The <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> ultimately emerge from the solar cell. These solar cells are particularly useful at very high levels of insolation because the infrared or heat radiation passes through the cells without being appreciably absorbed to heat the cell...|$|R
25|$|Hans Thirring {{argued in}} 1926, that an atom which is {{accelerated}} during the emission process by thermal collisions in the sun, is emitting light rays having different velocities at their start- and endpoints. So {{one end of}} the <b>light</b> <b>ray</b> would overtake the preceding parts, and consequently the distance between the ends would be elongated up to 500nbsp&km until they reach Earth, so that the mere existence of sharp spectral lines in the sun's radiation, disproves the ballistic model.|$|E
25|$|Ray {{transfer}} matrix analysis (also known as ABCD matrix analysis) {{is a type}} of ray tracing technique used in the design of some optical systems, particularly lasers. It involves the construction of a ray {{transfer matrix}} which describes the optical system; tracing of a light path through the system can then be performed by multiplying this matrix with a vector representing the <b>light</b> <b>ray.</b> The same analysis is also used in accelerator physics to track particles through the magnet installations of a particle accelerator, see Beam optics.|$|E
25|$|Snell's Law {{can be used}} {{to predict}} the {{deflection}} of light rays as they pass through linear media as long as the indexes of refraction and the geometry of the media are known. For example, the propagation of light through a prism results in the <b>light</b> <b>ray</b> being deflected depending on the shape and orientation of the prism. In most materials, the index of refraction varies with the frequency of the light. Taking this into account, Snell's Law {{can be used to}} predict how a prism will disperse light into a spectrum. The discovery of this phenomenon when passing light through a prism is famously attributed to Isaac Newton.|$|E

25|$|For {{cavities}} {{much larger}} than the wavelength of the light they contain, cavities with very high Q factors have already been realized (~125,000,000). However, high Q cavities on the order of {{the same size as the}} optical wavelength have been difficult to produce due to the inverse relationship between radiation losses and cavity size. When dealing with a cavity {{much larger than}} the optical wavelength, it is simple to design interfaces such that <b>light</b> <b>ray</b> paths fulfill total internal reflection conditions or Bragg reflection conditions. For light confined within much smaller cavities near the size of the optical wavelength, deviations from ray optics approximations become severe and it becomes infeasible, if not impossible to design a cavity which fulfills optimum reflection conditions for all three spatial components of the propagating light wave vectors.|$|E

The mirrors {{in this type of}} telescope are designed and positioned so that they share one focus and so that the second focus of the hyperbolic mirror will be at the same point at which the image is to be observed, usually just outside the eyepiece. The parabolic mirror reflects parallel <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> entering the telescope to its focus, which is also the focus of the hyperbolic mirror.

2500|$|In nature, a {{light source}} emits {{a ray of}} light which travels, eventually, to a surface that {{interrupts}} its progress. [...] One can think of this [...] "ray" [...] as a stream of photons traveling along the same path. [...] In a perfect vacuum this ray will be a straight line (ignoring relativistic effects). Any combination of four things might happen with this light ray: [...] absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence. [...] A surface may absorb part of the <b>light</b> <b>ray,</b> resulting {{in a loss of}} intensity of the reflected and/or refracted light. [...] It might also reflect {{all or part of the}} <b>light</b> <b>ray,</b> in one or more directions. If the surface has any transparent or translucent properties, it refracts a portion of the light beam into itself in a different direction while absorbing some (or all) of the spectrum (and possibly altering the color). Less commonly, a surface may absorb some portion of the light and fluorescently re-emit the light at a longer wavelength color in a random direction, though this is rare enough that it can be discounted from most rendering applications. Between absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence, all of the incoming light must be accounted for, and no more. [...] A surface cannot, for instance, reflect 66% of an incoming <b>light</b> <b>ray,</b> and refract 50%, since the two would add up to be 116%. From here, the reflected and/or refracted rays may strike other surfaces, where their absorptive, refractive, reflective and fluorescent properties again affect the progress of [...] the incoming rays.
