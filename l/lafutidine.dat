40|$|Aims: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of <b>lafutidine</b> therapy versus rabeprazole in Indian patients with endoscopically and histologically proven gastritis and peptic ulcer. Study Design: A double blind, double dummy, randomized, comparative study. Place and Duration of Study: Global Liver and Gastroenterology Centre, Bhopal, India, between March 2010 and October 2010. Methodology: A total of 100 patients were enrolled, including 50 with endoscopically and histologically proven gastritis and other 50 with peptic ulcer (over 5 mm in diameter). Each group was randomized to receive either <b>lafutidine</b> or rabeprazole tablet and their corresponding competitor placebo dummy tablet, {{for a period of}} 4 weeks. Cure rate was confirmed endoscopically at the end of week 4 as compared to the baseline evaluation. Symptom response and Helicobacter pylori (H.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} effects of {{rabeprazole}} and <b>lafutidine</b> on post-endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) gastric ulcers. METHODS: Patients with gastric tumors indicated for ESD were prospectively studied. After ESD, all patients were treated with intravenous omeprazole for the first 3 d. Patients were then randomly assigned to oral <b>lafutidine</b> or rabeprazole. Ulcer size, ulcer size reduction rate, and ulcer stage were evaluated 4 wk later. Occurrence of complication was monitored throughout the 4 -wk period. RESULTS: Sixty five patients {{were enrolled in the}} study, and 60 patients were subjected to the final analysis. In the <b>lafutidine</b> group (30 lesions in 29 patients), initial and 4 -wk post-ESD ulcer sizes were 33. 3 ± 9. 2 and 10. 5 ± 4. 8 mm, respectively. In the rabeprazole group (34 lesions in 31 patients), the values were 34. 7 ± 11. 3 and 11. 8 ± 6. 7 mm, respectively. Ulcer size reduction rates in <b>lafutidine</b> and rabeprazole groups were 32. 3 % and 33. 5 %, respectively (P = 0. 974). Ulcer stage 4 wk post-ESD did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = 0. 868). Two cases in the rabeprazole group and no cases in the <b>lafutidine</b> group developed ulcer bleeding during the oral dose period, although the difference of bleeding rate between the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0. 157).

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Lafutidine</b> is a {{histamine}} H 2 receptor antagonist, the gastroprotective {{effect of}} which is related to its antisecretory activity {{and its ability to}} activate a sensory neuron-dependent mechanism of defence. The present study investigated whether intragastric administration of <b>lafutidine</b> (10 and 30 mg/kg) modifies vagal afferent signalling, mucosal injury, intragastric acidity and gastric emptying after gastric acid challenge. Methods Adult rats were treated with vehicle, <b>lafutidine</b> (10 – 30 mg/kg) or cimetidine (10 mg/kg), and 30 min later their stomachs were exposed to exogenous HCl (0. 25 M). During the period of 2 h post-HCl, intragastric pH, gastric volume, gastric acidity and extent of macroscopic gastric mucosal injury were determined and the activation of neurons in the brainstem was visualized by c-Fos immunocytochemistry. Results Gastric acid challenge enhanced the expression of c-Fos in the nucleus tractus solitarii but caused only minimal damage to the gastric mucosa. <b>Lafutidine</b> reduced the HCl-evoked expression of c-Fos in the NTS and elevated the intragastric pH following intragastric administration of excess HCl. Further analysis showed that the gastroprotective effect of <b>lafutidine</b> against excess acid was delayed and went in parallel with facilitation of gastric emptying, measured indirectly via gastric volume changes, and a reduction of gastric acidity. The H 2 receptor antagonist cimetidine had similar but weaker effects. Conclusion These observations indicate that <b>lafutidine</b> inhibits the vagal afferent signalling of a gastric acid insult, which may reflect an inhibitory action on acid-induced gastric pain. The ability of <b>lafutidine</b> to decrease intragastric acidity following exposure to excess HCl cannot be explained by its antisecretory activity but appears to reflect dilution and/or emptying of the acid load into the duodenum. This profile of actions emphasizes the notion that H 2 receptor antagonists can protect the gastric mucosa from acid injury independently of their ability to suppress gastric acid secretion. </p...|$|E

40|$|Capsaicin {{sensitive}} afferent nerves play {{an important}} role in gastric mucosal defensive mechanisms. Capsaicin stimulates afferent nerves and enhances the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which seems to be the predominant neurotransmitter of spinal afferents in the rat stomach, exerting many pharmacological effects by a direct mechanism or indirectly through second messengers such as nitric oxide (NO). <b>Lafutidine</b> is a new type of anti-ulcer drug, possessing both an antisecretory effect, exerted via histamine H 2 receptor blockade, and gastroprotective activities. Studies with certain antagonists or chemical deafferentation techniques suggest the gastroprotective actions of <b>lafutidine</b> to be mediated by capsaicin sensitive afferent nerves, but this is an assumption based on indirect techniques. In order to explain the direct relation of <b>lafutidine</b> to afferent nerves, we conducted the following studies. We determined CGRP and NO release from rat stomach and specific [3 H]-resiniferatoxin (RTX) binding to gastric vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR 1), which binds capsaicin, using EIA, a microdialysis system and a radioreceptor assay, respectively. <b>Lafutidine</b> enhanced both CGRP and NO release from the rat stomach induced by a submaximal dose of capsaicin, but had no effect on specific [3 H]-RTX and capsaicin binding to VR 1. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that <b>lafutidine</b> modulates the activity of capsaicin sensitive afferent nerves in the rat stomach, which may be a key mechanism involved in its gastroprotective action...|$|E
30|$|Premixed buffer {{and organic}} {{modifier}} combinations {{were prepared for}} mobile phase A and mobile phase B to improve the baseline interference. Various combinations of gradient time programs were tried and then finalized wherein all impurities and degradents are well separated from the main peak due to <b>lafutidine.</b> The wavelength for analysis was selected as 276 nm which is UV maxima of <b>lafutidine.</b> The temperature selection of 35 °C was optimized so as to attain maximum separation between the critical pair which is Imp-D and <b>lafutidine.</b> The rationale for selecting the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 3 -mm ID column was {{that the increase in}} flow rate reduced the resolution between Imp-D and <b>lafutidine</b> to less than 2.0 which was not acceptable. The effect of sub- 2 μm particle size was not considered while calculating the total flow rate because from Van Deemter curve, at around 1.7 μm particle size, one can attain the lowest height equivalent of theoretical plates (or highest resolution) that is constant over a wide range of flow rates.|$|E
30|$|The {{analytical}} method for determination of <b>lafutidine</b> and its impurities in bulk and {{pharmaceutical dosage form}} is highly essential to monitor and control the impurities in the drug substances. Although many analytical techniques like gas chromatography (GC), capillary electrophoresis (CE), and liquid chromatography (LC) can be employed for the analysis, {{the most widely used}} technique is the reversed-phase liquid chromatography employing a non-polar stationary phase [4, 5]. An extensive literature survey revealed that there are several bioanalytical high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods reported in the literature for the analysis of <b>lafutidine</b> in human plasma using HPLC-ESI-MS [6, 7], in tablet dosage form by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography [8] and in human serum by HPLC with fluorescence detection [9]. To the best of our knowledge, none of the currently available {{analytical method}}s can separate all the known related compounds and degradation impurities of <b>lafutidine</b> drug substance. There is no pharmacopoieal reference available for analysis of bulk API or solid dosage form of <b>lafutidine.</b> Furthermore, there is no cost- and time-effective method reported in the literature that can adequately separate <b>lafutidine</b> from its impurities and degradents in bulk and pharmaceutical dosage form. Moreover, the analysis using LCMS, GC/MSD, and LC-MS is very expensive and delicate as compared to ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) for routine quality control analysis. Hence, we focused on developing a selective, fast, cost-effective, and stability-indicating method using this advanced technique (UPLC) for the determination of <b>lafutidine</b> and its impurities in bulk and pharmaceutical dosage form. Hence, a reproducible stability-indicating UPLC method was developed which is time- and cost-effective as compared to the reported methods. The method was successfully validated according to the USP< 1225 > Validation of Compendial Procedures and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines Q 2 (R 1) for validation of analytical procedures: text and methodology [10, 11].|$|E

Subcutaneous injection of bortezomib reduced PN, but 24 % of cases were grade 2 PN and 6 % of cases were grade 3 PN. PN higher than grade 2 was not resolved by subcutaneous injection. PN higher than grade 3 has serious dose limiting toxicity and {{is the cause of}} discontinuing bortezomib treatment. <b>Lafutidine</b> is an H 2 -blocker with gastroprotective activity and is thought to function by increasing mucosal blood flow via capsaicin sensitive neurons. The same activity of <b>lafutidine</b> is considered to improve glossodynia and taxane induced PN. We hypothesized that <b>lafutidine</b> prevents or improves PN that is caused by bortezomib. In the current study, bortezomib was administered in the usual manner (intravenous administration of bortezomib 1. 3 mg/m 2, twice a week for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week without treatment) for up to four cycles to compare our data with other studies. <b>Lafutidine</b> was administered orally at a dose of 10 mg twice daily. In our eight evaluated cases, the total occurrence of PN was four out of eight patients (50 %). There were only grade 1 PN (4 out of 8) cases, and no cases higher than grade 2.

The values of LOD and LOQ for impurities A, B, C, and D were found to be in the range of 0.007 % to 0.022 % and 0.008 % to 0.023 %, respectively. The calculated LOQ concentrations of all the components were verified for precision by injecting six individual preparations of Imp-A, Imp-B, Imp-C, Imp-D, and <b>lafutidine.</b> The RSD of LOQ precision was in the range of 1.22 % to 9.78 %. These limits of quantification levels of the impurities were helpful for the research work in controlling the impurities at the accepted level during the optimization of the process. The results were depicted in Table[*] 3.|$|E
30|$|To {{determine}} {{the stability of}} sample solution, the sample solutions of <b>lafutidine</b> spiked with related substances at specified level were prepared and analyzed immediately after preparation and after different time intervals up to 48 hrs, while maintaining the sample cooler temperature at about 25 °C The results from these studies indicated that the sample solutions were stable at room temperature upto 48 hrs.|$|E
30|$|To {{evaluate}} the robustness {{of the developed}} method, the chromatographic conditions were deliberately altered and the resolution between closely eluting peak pair i.e. Imp-D and <b>Lafutidine</b> was evaluated. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.5 mL min- 1. To study the effect of flow rate on the resolution, the same was altered by 0.1 units i.e. from 0.4 to 0.6 mL min- 1. The effect of column temperature on resolution was studied at 32 °C and 38 °C instead of 35 °. All the other mobile phase components were held constant as described above. In all the deliberate varied chromatographic conditions (flow rate and column temperature), the tailing factor of <b>Lafutidine</b> was less than 1.30 and the resolution between any two peaks was greater than 2.0. There was a very minor variation in the resolution and tailing factor results observed in all the robustness conditions illustrating the robustness of the method.|$|E
30|$|Accuracy of {{the method}} for all the related {{substances}} was determined by analyzing <b>lafutidine</b> sample solutions spiked with all the related substances at seven different concentration levels of LOQ, 20 40, 50, 80, 100 and 150 % of each in triplicate at the specified limit. The recovery of all these related substances {{were found to be}} in-between the predefined acceptance criterion of 80.0 – 120.0 % and the data is given in Table[*] 3.|$|E
30|$|The diluent {{used for}} the {{analysis}} was prepared by preparing homogenous mixture of 700 ml of water and 300 ml acetonitrile. A solution of <b>lafutidine</b> was prepared at concentration of 1, 000 μg mL− 1 in diluent. Stock solutions of each impurity (Imp-A, Imp-B, Imp-C, and Imp-D) were prepared at concentration about 150 μg mL− 1 in diluent. These solutions were further diluted to prepare the standard solution for quantification of impurities {{according to the specification}} limits (0.15 %) of each impurity.|$|E
30|$|Impurities A, B, C, and D are spiked in <b>lafutidine</b> at desired {{concentrations}} of 0.15 % {{with respect to}} test concentration of 1, 000 μg mL− 1 to confirm the retention times under the chosen chromatographic conditions. All the impurities were well resolved from each other. Among the identified impurities, Imp-A and Imp-B are the process as well as degradation impurities; Imp-C is the key starting material in the process as well as degradation impurity; Imp-D is a process related impurity (Figure[*] 1).|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <b>Lafutidine</b> {{is a novel}} H(2) -receptor {{antagonist}} with gastroprotective {{activity that}} includes enhancement of gastric mucosal blood flow. The aim {{of the present study}} was to test the efficacy of 7 - or 14 -day lafutidine-clarithromycin-amoxicillin therapy versus a lansoprazole-based regimen for Helicobacter pylori eradication. METHODS: Four hundred and sixty-three patients with H. pylori-infected peptic ulcer disease were randomized to one of four regimens: (1) <b>lafutidine</b> (20 mg b. i. d.), clarithromycin (500 mg b. i. d.) and amoxicillin (1000 mg b. i. d.) for 7 days (the 7 LFT group) or (2) for 14 days (the 14 LFT group); (3) lansoprazole (30 mg b. i. d.), clarithromycin (500 mg b. i. d.), and amoxicillin (1000 mg b. i. d.) for 7 days (the 7 LPZ group); or (4) for 14 days (the 14 LPZ group). The eradication rates, drug compliance, and adverse effects among the four regimens were compared. RESULTS: The eradication rates by the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses in the 7 LFT and 7 LPZ groups were 76. 5 % and 81. 6 %, and 76. 9 % and 82. 0 % (p =. 94 and. 95), respectively. The eradication rates by intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses in the 14 LFT and 14 LPZ groups were 78. 2 % and 82. 2 %, and 80. 4 % and 85. 9 % (p =. 70 and. 49), respectively. The treatment duration for 7 days or 14 days did not affect the eradication rates. In addition, the adverse effect rates and discontinuation rates were similar among the four groups. Furthermore, the ulcer cure rate and symptom response rate were similar in the <b>lafutidine</b> and lansoprazole groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that lafutidine-clarithromycin-amoxicillin therapy was a safe and effective as lansoprazole-based triple therapy for the eradication rate of H. pylori, and could be considered as an additional treatment option...|$|E

Aim. Gastrointestinal mucositis is a frequent complication of antineoplastic chemotherapy, but the effects of chemotherapy on mucosal defense mechanisms remain poorly understood. We studied the effects of cisplatin on mucin, {{one of the principal}} defense factors of the gastrointestinal mucosa, and evaluated the efficacy of two different types of H 2 -receptor antagonists against cisplatin-inducedmucositis. Methods. Cisplatin (6 mg/kg) was administered intravenously to rats (day 0). The rats were sacrificed 1, 3, 7, and 11 days after treatment, and their stomach, jejunum, ileum, and colon were removed. Immunoreactivity of the mucosa was compared with the use of anti-mucin monoclonal antibody. To evaluate the efficacy of H 2 -receptor antagonists, either famotidine (3 mg/kg) or <b>lafutidine</b> (30 mg/kg) was given orally once daily on days 0, 1, and 2. Histological and biochemical findings were compared among the groups to assess effects on cisplatin-induced injury. Results. Cisplatin significantly altered the immunoreactivity and content of mucin in the small intestinal mucosa, especially in the ileum. <b>Lafutidine</b> protected against cisplatin-induced mucosal injury and attenuated decreased mucin accumulation. Conclusion. Cisplatin appears to alter the mucus barrier functio...|$|E
