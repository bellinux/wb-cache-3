5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> Asian cities, {{driving is}} the main mode of {{commuting}} in Kuala Lumpur. Hence, {{every part of the}} city is well connected by highways. As capital of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur has a comprehensive road network that leads to the rest of Peninsular Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> Proteaceae, B.spinulosa has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> Proteaceae, B.telmatiaea has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E
50|$|This warbler, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>others,</b> {{is nervous}} and quick while foraging. It creeps along {{branches}} and is found at all levels. It is solitary while nesting, but forms mixed flocks after breeding.|$|R
50|$|As the Argentine {{railway system}} {{declined}} (most {{of the remaining}} passenger services being cancelled in 1977, and the cargo services privatized and downsized in the 1990s), the station, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>others,</b> fell into abandon.|$|R
50|$|This salmon, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>others,</b> is {{a highly}} {{commercial}} species caught in fisheries, raised for aquaculture, and sought after as a game fish. It is marketed fresh and frozen and is often eaten broiled or baked.|$|R
5|$|Banksia verticillata {{is seldom}} seen in cultivation. The natural growing {{conditions}} {{point to a}} sunny aspect and good drainage as being important in cultivation. It is good for coastal situations and erosion control. Very sensitive to dieback, B. verticillata (<b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> western Australian banksias) perishes quickly in humid conditions or poor drainage. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia integrifolia. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 49 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> Proteaceae, B.ericifolia has proteoid roots—roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. The species lacks a lignotuber, and so is killed by fire and regenerates from seed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> Proteaceae, B.integrifolia has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, thus allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Studies on B.integrifolia suggest that its proteoid root mat achieves this by chemically modifying its soil environment.|$|E
50|$|Filip Saidak {{gave the}} {{following}} proof that (<b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> including Euclid's) {{does not use}} reductio ad absurdum and also does not use Euclid's Lemma that if a prime p divides ab then it must divide a or b.|$|R
5000|$|Mothball [...] - [...] A Realitant {{from the}} 5th Reality. She is about eight {{feet tall and}} speaks with a thick British accent, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> from the 5th reality. She was given her strange name when Bugaboo {{soldiers}} from the 5th reality were attacking her family.|$|R
50|$|In 1967 {{construction}} {{began on}} {{the first stage of}} the Kharkiv Metro, which opened in 1975, this was soon joined by the semi-Metro Kryvyi Rih Metrotram in 1986 and the Dnipropetrovsk Metro in 1995. Stations built in these systems, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> in the former Soviet Union, have.|$|R
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> Proteaceae, B.sessilis has {{compound}} cluster roots, roots with dense {{clusters of}} short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These exude a range of carboxylates, including citrate, malonate and trans-aconitate, that act as acid phosphatase, allowing the absorption of nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> Proteaceae, Banksia violacea has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, thus allowing their uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient soils of Australia. B.violacea is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
5|$|Other {{wild and}} trained Pikachu appear {{throughout}} the series, often interacting with Ash and his Pikachu. The most notable among these is Ritchie's Pikachu, Sparky. <b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> Pokémon, Pikachu communicates only by saying syllables {{of its own}} name. It is voiced by Ikue Ōtani in all versions of the anime. In Pokémon Live!, the musical stage show adapted from the anime, Pikachu was played by Jennifer Risser.|$|E
50|$|The peak of Najo's playing career {{coincided with}} America’s Great Depression, {{during which the}} {{industry}} of professional baseball, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>others,</b> fell on hard times. Members of his family believe that the Depression was {{a significant factor in}} keeping Najo from attempting a return to the major leagues.|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the late American Civil War, St. Francois County, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> in Missouri, was divided politically, and many took refuge from the enrollment act in the ranks under M. Jeff. Thompson, whose force at one time destroyed the Iron Mountain Railroad bridge over the Big River.|$|R
5|$|Some {{species are}} oviparous <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> fish, laying their {{eggs in the}} water. In most oviparous shark species, an egg case with the {{consistency}} of leather protects the developing embryo(s). These cases may be corkscrewed into crevices for protection. Once empty, the egg case {{is known as a}} mermaid's purse, and can wash up on shore. Oviparous sharks include the horn shark, catshark, Port Jackson shark, and swellshark.|$|E
5|$|The M9 {{was used}} in World War II, the Arab-Israeli War of 1948, the Korean War, the Suez Crisis, and many other conflicts. The {{production}} of M9s was leased to other countries, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> IH half-tracks produced in World War II. This M9A1 was leased to both the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, the latter providing it to {{other countries in the}} British Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|According to Richard Maxwell Eaton, {{author of}} A Social History of the Deccan, Vithoba was first worshipped as a {{pastoral}} god {{as early as}} the 6th century. Vithoba's arms-akimbo iconography is similar to Bir Kuar, the cattle-god of the Ahirs of Bihar, who is now also associated with Krishna. Vithoba was probably later assimilated into the Shaiva pantheon and identified with the god Shiva, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> pastoral gods. This is backed by the facts that the temple at Pandharpur is surrounded by Shaiva temples (most notably of the devotee Pundalik himself), and that Vithoba is crowned with the Linga, symbol of Shiva. However, since the 13th century, the poet-saints like Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram identified Vithoba with Vishnu.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{stations}} that program [...] "Real Country" [...] {{use it for}} a majority of their programming, affiliates -- <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> who use satellite programming -- will often replace the network feed at certain points of the day for local programming, most often news, sports and markets (depending on the station).|$|R
50|$|On 29 October 1675 Olivier Charbonneau {{received}} the first land grant in this area. Pierre Boucher, formerly governor of Trois-Rivières became Procurator of the Prelate of Quebec François de Laval, {{who signed the}} deed of sale. Olivier has left his mark there, because, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> of his time, he was illiterate.|$|R
50|$|Both Ophain and Braine-l'Alleud host yearly carnivals {{featuring}} giant puppets <b>like</b> in <b>most</b> <b>other</b> Belgian towns.|$|R
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of Macabeemyrma ovata {{may have been}} similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants. The ant is large with long legs and elongated mandibles. It presumably had large eyes {{that were used to}} hunt for prey and navigation, and the ant was possibly equipped with a sting. Colonies most likely nested in the soil <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> Myrmeciinae, but like some Myrmecia species it is possible they were an arboreal nesting species. Workers were solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto vegetation while preying on arthropods. Workers most likely did not recruit other ants to food sources or lay down pheromone trails.|$|E
5|$|Archidermaptera is {{believed}} to be sister to the remaining earwig groups, the extinct Eodermaptera and the living suborder Neodermaptera (= former suborders Forficulina, Hemimerina, and Arixeniina). The extinct suborders have tarsi with five segments (unlike the three found in Neodermaptera) as well as unsegmented cerci. No fossil Hemimeridae and Arixeniidae are known. Species in Hemimeridae were at one time in their own order, Diploglassata, Dermodermaptera, or Hemimerina. <b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> epizoic species, there is no fossil record, but they are probably no older than late Tertiary.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> LDS Church apostles, Kimball {{traveled}} extensively {{to fulfill}} {{a wide variety of}} administrative and ecclesiastical duties. Early in his time as an apostle, Kimball was directed by church president George Albert Smith to spend extra time in religious and humanitarian work with Native Americans, which Kimball did throughout his life. He initiated the Indian Placement Program, which helped many Native American students gain education in the 1960s and 1970s while they stayed with LDS foster families.|$|E
5000|$|On June 19, 2006, the AIFA {{announced}} that Danville {{would get a}} team {{to play at the}} Palmer Arena. Commissioner Andrew Haines owned the team (<b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>others)</b> until a suitable owner could be found. Local radio station WDAN held a name-the-team contest, with 95% of the entries beginning with the letter [...] "D".|$|R
50|$|As one of {{the wealthiest}} men in Metropolis, Edge was a major {{political}} figure in the city and frequently encountered Superman, the subject of many of his network's news stories, whom he, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>others,</b> failed to realize was also Clark Kent. Although rarely integral to a plotline, Edge was a supporting character in many Superman stories.|$|R
50|$|Schultz {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} figures in the legislature during the 1940s and 1950s. <b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> in the Liberal-Progressive Party, he was essentially conservative in his political views and reluctant to legislate progressive changes. He opposed increases in Mothers' Allowances in the 1940s, and opposed penal reform even prior to his appointment as Attorney General.|$|R
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> Proteaceae, B.epica has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. The species lacks a lignotuber, so {{is thought to be}} killed by fire. Like most Banksia species, however, it is adapted to release its aerial seed bank following a bushfire, so populations regenerate rapidly. It is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> coastal Orange County streams, the {{watershed}} of Aliso Creek is now heavily urbanized. With 70percent {{of the original}} land surface now underneath impermeable surfaces such as pavement and buildings, far more runoff now enters the creek—not only inducing an increased year-round flow, but much larger rainy season flows. In the 1920s and 1930s, devastating floods wreaked havoc on much of southern California; the Los Angeles Flood of 1938 was the most famous flooding episode of this period.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> {{members of}} its genus, the phylogenetic {{position}} of the blacktip reef shark remains indeterminate. Based on morphology, Jack Garrick proposed in 1982 that the closest relative of the blacktip reef shark was the nervous shark (C.cautus). Leonard Compagno's 1988 morphological analysis suggested affinity not only between this species and the nervous shark, but also four other species, and could not resolve their relationships further. A 1998 allozyme analysis by Gavin Naylor again yielded ambiguous results, finding that the blacktip reef shark forms a polytomy (irresolvable group) with 10 other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
50|$|Some {{programs}} offer dual degrees. For example, the University of Cincinnati {{offers an}} MA/MBA program {{in conjunction with}} the Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music. The UC/CCM Graduate Arts Administration Program, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>others,</b> exists to prepare and train students to become successful CEOs and senior managers of non-profit arts and cultural institutions by combining business administration and real-world experience.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station is}} unstaffed (<b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> on the route) {{and has no}} ticket machine, so {{passengers}} must purchase these on the train or prior to travel. Shelters are located on both platforms, which are linked by a footbridge. Step-free access is available only on the southbound side (where the main entrance is situated). [...] Train running information is provided via telephone and timetable posters.|$|R
