In PNGA, an updating strategy based on PN is used for improving the crossover operator of traditional GA, in which the same parts of parent chromosomes are reserved and the new offspring by the Physarum network model is generated. In order to estimate the effectiveness of our proposed optimized strategy, some typical genetic algorithms and the proposed PNGA are compared for solving multicast routing.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the first fitness landscape {{analysis on the}} delay-constrained <b>least-cost</b> multicast <b>routing</b> problem (DCLC-MRP), a well-known NP-hard problem. Although the problem has attracted an increasing research attention {{over the past decade}} in telecommunications and operational research, little research has been conducted to analyze the features of its underlying landscape. Two of the most commonly used landscape analysis techniques, the fitness distance correlation analysis and the autocorrelation analysis, have been applied to analyze the global and local landscape features for DCLC-MRPs. A large amount of simulation experiments on a set of problem instances generated based on the benchmark Steiner tree problems in the OR-library reveals that the landscape of the DCLC-MRP is highly instance dependent with different landscape features. Different delay bounds also affect the distribution of solutions in the search space. The autocorrelation analysis on the benchmark instances of different sizes and delay bounds shows the impact of different local search heuristics and neighborhood structures on the fitness distance landscapes of the DCLC-MRP. The delay bound constraint in the DCLC-MRP has shown a great influence on the underlying landscape characteristic of the problem. Based on the fitness landscape analysis, an iterative local search (ILS) approach is proposed in this paper {{for the first time to}} tackle the DCLC-MRP. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ILS algorithm for the problem in comparison with other algorithms in the literature...|$|R

40|$|The Delay-constrained <b>least-cost</b> <b>routing</b> {{problem is}} to find the least cost path which {{satisfies}} a given delay constraint. There are two major difficulties to solve this problem. The first difficulty is the NP-Completeness of this routing problem. The second difficulty is that the networking information used for routing may be imprecise. The ticket-based routing (TBR) algorithm[1], aiming to find a sub-optimal solution, provides a heuristic approach to overcome the above difficulties and solve the routing problem. Although TBR proposes a detailed ticket forwarding method based on imprecise end-to-end information, it does not optimize the ticket probing process so as to find better paths. This paper proposes an Enhanced Ticket-based Routing (ETBR) algorithm. The ETBR improves the effectiveness of ticket probing by two techniques. The first technique uses colorbased ticket distribution for tickets of different colors. The tracing information of green tickets and yellow tickets is kept separately to avoid unnecessary ticket dropping. The second technique uses historical probing results to optimize ticket probing, so that redundant probing paths are eliminated. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the ETBR can find paths which have much lower cost than TBR, without decreasing the success ratio or increasing the message overhead...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Upon the {{occurrence}} of a phenomenon of interest in a wireless sensor network, multiple sensors may be activated, leading to data implosion and redundancy. Data aggregation and/or fusion techniques exploit spatio-temporal correlation among sensory data to reduce traffic load and mitigate congestion. However, this is often {{at the expense of}} loss in Information Quality (IQ) of data that is collected at the fusion center. In this work, we address the problem of finding the leastcost routing tree that satisfies a given IQ constraint. We note that the optimal <b>least-cost</b> <b>routing</b> solution is a variation of the classical NP-hard Steiner tree problem in graphs, which incurs high overheads as it requires knowledge of the entire network topology and individual IQ contributions of each activated sensor node. We tackle these issues by proposing: (i) a topology-aware histogram-based aggregation structure that encapsulates the cost of including the IQ contribution of each activated node in a compact and efficient way; and (ii) a greedy heuristic to approximate and prune a least-cost aggregation routing path. We show that the performance of our IQ-aware routing protocol is: (i) bounded by a distance-based aggregation tree that collects data from all the activated nodes; and (ii) comparable to another IQ-aware routing protocol that uses an exhaustive brute-force search to approximate and prune the least-cost aggregation tree.

40|$|The {{availability}} of both global and regional elevation datasets acquired by modern remote sensing technologies {{provides an opportunity}} to significantly improve the accuracy of stream mapping, especially in remote, hard to reach regions. Stream extraction from digital elevation models (DEMs) is based on computation of flow accumulation, a summary parameter that poses performance and accuracy challenges when applied to large, noisy DEMs generated by remote sensing technologies. Robust handling of DEM depressions is essential for reliable extraction of connected drainage networks from this type of data. The <b>least-cost</b> flow <b>routing</b> method implemented in GRASS GIS as the module r. watershed was redesigned to significantly improve its speed, functionality, and memory requirements and make it an efficient tool for stream mapping and watershed analysis from large DEMs. To evaluate its handling of large depressions, typical for remote sensing derived DEMs, three different methods were compared: traditional sink filling, impact reduction approach, and least-cost path search. The comparison was performed using the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar for Elevation (IFSARE) datasets covering central Panama at 90 m and 10 m resolutions, respectively. The accuracy assessment was based on ground control points acquired by GPS and reference points digitized from Landsat imagery along segments of selected Panamanian rivers.

This paper addresses the <b>least-cost</b> opportunistic <b>routing</b> (LCOR) problem: how to assign the set of candidate next-hops at each node for a given destination such that the expected cost of forwarding a packet to the destination is minimized. We solve this problem with a distributed algorithm that provably computes the optimal assignment of candidate next-hops that each node should allow to reach a particular destination. Prior proposals based on single-path routing metrics or geographic coordinates do not explicitly consider this tradeoff, and as a result make choices which are not always optimal. The LCOR algorithm and framework are general and can be applied to a variety of networks and cost models, including and beyond ETX-based metrics to improve throughput with lossy links. This paper further focuses on the application of LCOR to low-power wireless communication, and introduces a new link-layer technique to decrease energy transmission costs in conjunction with opportunistic forwarding. The design is implemented and evaluated on a 50 -node wireless testbed. Simulation and testbed results demonstrate reductions in energy transmission by up to a factor of three compared to standard routing, up to 30 % compared to opportunistic routing using single-path metrics. Furthermore LCOR routes are more robust and stable than with approaches based on single-path distances, due to the integrative nature of the LCOR’s route cost metric. 1...|$|R
