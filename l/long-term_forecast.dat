The core of long-term models is extended by introducing production functions generating potential output.

Several channels of transfer of foreign R&D can be distinguished. The potential output differs from the effective output, representing final demand, underlying business cycle fluctuations. To study potential disequilibria a system of equations explaining final demand must be established. Thus the long-term macroeconometric model must be a complete model.

By the application of 12 types of hybrid and pure models in estuarine 1096 day river stage series forecasting, different forecast performances and the superiorities of CDW-NN model with corresponding driving mechanisms are discussed, and one type of CDW-NN model (CDW-NF), which uses Neuro-Fuzzy as the forecast submodel, has been proven {{to be the most}} effective MSA predictor for the accuracy enhancement in the overall 1096 days <b>long-term</b> <b>forecast.</b> The special superiority of CDW-NF model lies in the CWT based methodology, which determines the 15 and 28 day prior data series as model inputs by revealing the significant short-time periodicities involved in estuarine river stage signals.
