40|$|As {{a result}} of rapid product development, the product life cycle has become shorter, and thus {{the amount of waste}} from {{discarded}} industrial products has risen dramatically. An awareness of the worlds environmental problems has stimulated researchers to explore the opportunities to reuse, recycle and remanufacture end-of-life products. Disassembly is a systematic approach to separating products into components or subassemblies in order to facilitate recovery of components or materials. However, the full disassembly of a product tends to be unproductive due to technical and cost constraints and product conditions after usage. Therefore, selective disassembly has been introduced as a more practical approach, where {{only a limited number of}} disassembly paths that lead to selected parts with recovering potential are considered. This research focuses on the development of a selective disassembly methodology by reversing an assembly sequencing approach. The methodology uses a step-by-step approach to generate a disassembly sequence diagram. This involves listing all the parts within the product, generating a liaison diagram to illustrate part relationships and then establishing precedence rules describing prerequisite actions for each liaison. This is followed by segregating disassembly paths that lead to the removal of selected parts or subassemblies. Then a winnowing process is applied to these paths to eliminate invalid disassembly states and transitions. The last step is to select the optimal disassembly path by using the time requirement as the main selection criterion. In order to shorten the time for carrying out the sequencing process, a javabased program that is capable of performing the first three steps has been created. The program requires three basic inputs in forms of precedence rules, and user-required part (s) and disassembly rules, prescribing which <b>liaison</b> (<b>s)</b> should be done subsequent to a particular liaison. The viability of the methodology and the program is proved through seven case studies conducted on a fishing reel, a single-hole punch, a kettle, an entire washing machine and three washing machine subassemblies. The application of the program allows the users to determine an optimal disassembly sequence in a very short time and with only basic product information as the input...|$|E

40|$|The five {{chapters}} of this dissertation discuss Montesquieu 2 ̆ 7 s Lettres persanes (1721; 1754; 1758), Riccoboni 2 ̆ 7 s Lettres de Milady Juliette Catesby (1759), Laclos 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Liaisons</b> dangereuses (1782), Gouges 2 ̆ 7 s Mémoire de Madame de Valmont (1784; 1788) and Charriere 2 ̆ 7 s Lettres trouvées dans des portefeuilles d 2 ̆ 7 émigrés (1793). They analyze {{the ways in}} which eighteenth-century literary heroines critique the gendering of traditional social practices and norms, and then generalize their personal situations to mount a case for women 2 ̆ 7 s rights at large. I argue that these texts can be read as fictions of sociability insofar as they stage contemporary social relations and articulate a theoretical discourse on the laws that govern human society. In particular these novels set up a confrontation between two historic conceptions of human relations. Initially elaborated and rehearsed in the seventeenth-century salons, the first was a moralist philosophy that focused on the behavioral aspects of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s social and intellectual existence. The second was more heavily inspired by the politico judicial discourse of natural law: it involved an analysis of the fundamental characteristics of human nature, as well as an understanding of the rules and dynamics by which societies can be established and maintained. It studied the individual 2 ̆ 7 s natural and civic rights, as well as his or her social duties. As it analyzes {{the ways in which}} these two different discourses were gendered and juxtapose in the Enlightenment epistolary novel, this dissertation traces changing representations of human sociability {{over the course of the}} eighteenth century. It also investigates the cultural significance of epistolarity, for, in this fictional corpus, letter writing is repeatedly imagined as a destabilizing intellectual, social, judicial and political act. ...|$|R

The program begins with a five-day workshop next week on the UGA campus. Through the project 2 ̆ 2 Developing the Palestinian Legal System: Institutional Partnering to Strengthen Human Capacity, Democratic Process and Economic Development, 2 ̆ 2 the Dean Rusk Center-International, Comparative and Graduate Legal Studies at the University of Georgia School of Law will host four training workshops conducted by UGA faculty in conjunction with Palestinian law scholars in the following areas: commercial law, water law, intellectual property law and the law on alternative dispute resolution. The program {{is supported by a}} two-year grant from the Association <b>Liaison</b> Office/U. <b>S.</b> A. I. D. to collaborate with Palestinian law faculty under the U. S. -Palestinian Linkages in Higher Education (UPLINK) program. The commercial law session, the first workshop, runs August 6 through 10. Gabriel Wilner, Charles H. Kirbo Professor of International Law {{and executive director of the}} Rusk Center, says the workshops are an exciting opportunity for both the Palestinian and the UGA scholars who are participating. 2 ̆ 2 The Center was pleased to have been given the task of cooperating with Birzeit University and other leading Palestinian universities to review the existing law in certain fields and discuss possible approaches that would lead to adaptation and modernization. 2 ̆ 2 Wilner says where necessary 2 ̆ 2 the Palestinian legal system must be refashioned and then positioned to provide support for the economic and political development of the Palestinian territory. We welcome the opportunity of working with our academic colleagues at the Palestinian universities in the several fields of law. In particular, I look forward to being involved in the project on dispute settlement in the Palestinian legal system. 2 ̆ 2 Nine Palestinian faculty, representing Al-Azhar University (Gaza City), An-Najah National University (Nablus, West Bank), Birzeit University (Birzeit, West Bank) and Al-Quds University (Abu Dis, Jerusalem), plan to participate in the commercial law workshop. The five-day program will be led by UGA law faculty Julian B. McDonnell and James C. Smith. 2 ̆ 2 My colleagues and I are looking forward to a productive exchange of ideas with our Palestinian guests, 2 ̆ 2 says McDonnell, the John A. Sibley Professor of Law, who specializes in contracts, commercial paper and secured transactions. James C. Smith says the first workshop will focus on commercial law, 2 ̆ 2 a necessary ingredient for a thriving market economy. Our primary expertise is in U. S. commercial law. A major part of the interchange with our Palestinian colleagues will be to discuss U. S. approaches that may be incorporated, sometimes with modifications, into the Palestinian commercial law system. 2 ̆ 2 Smith, whose other areas of expertise include property and real estate transactions, is the John Byrd Martin Professor of Law. #...|$|R
