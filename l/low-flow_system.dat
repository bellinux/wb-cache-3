40|$|Since 1996, Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico (SNL/NM) has run both a {{portable}} high-volume air-piston pump {{system and a}} dedicated, low-flow bladder pump system to collect groundwater samples. The groundwater contaminants of concern at SNL/NM are nitrate and the volatile organic compounds trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloethene (PCE). Regulatory acceptance is more common for the high-volume air piston pump system, especially for programs like SNL/NM's, which are regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). This paper describes logistical and analytical results of the groundwater sampling systems used at SNL/NM. With two modifications to the off-the-shelf low-flow bladder pump, SNL/NM consistently operates the dedicated <b>low-flow</b> <b>system</b> at depths greater than 450 feet below ground surface. As such, the low-flow sampling system requires fewer personnel, less time and materials, and generates less purge and decontamination water than does the high-volume system. However, the bladder pump cannot work in wells with less than 4 feet of water. A review of turbidity and laboratory analytical results for TCE, PCE, and chromium (Cr) from six wells highlight the affect or lack of affects the sampling systems have on groundwater samples. In the PVC wells, turbidity typically remained < 5 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) regardless of the sampling system. In the wells with a stainless steel screen, turbidity typically remained < 5 NTU only with the <b>low-flow</b> <b>system.</b> When the high-volume system was used, the turbidity and Cr concentration typically increased an order of magnitude. TCE concentrations at two wells {{did not appear to}} be sensitive to the sampling method used. However, PCE and TCE concentrations dropped an order of magnitude when the high-volume system was used at two other wells. This paper recommends that SNL/NM collaborate with other facilities with similar groundwater depths, continue to pursue regulatory approval for using dedicated the lowflow system, and review data for sample system affects on nitrate concentrations...|$|E

40|$|Low-flow solar {{hot water}} heating systems employ flow {{rates on the}} order of 1 / 5 to 1 / 10 of the {{conventional}} flow. <b>Low-flow</b> <b>systems</b> are of interest because the reduced flow rate allows smaller diameter tubing, which is less costly to install.

40|$|This thesis {{starts from}} the {{recognition}} that a hydronic heating system can be optimised, but can never be totally perfect. Sooner or later, in practice, deviations - caused {{by one or more}} components having slightly different characteristics or settings than they are assumed or supposed to have - arise. The aim of this work is to show how system design affects the overall sensitivity to deviations, in terms of the effect on performance and return water temperature. The systems that have been analysed are radiator systems and air heaters controlled by valve groups, both supplied by heat from district heating. In particular, the analysis has been concentrated on differences between high-flow and <b>low-flow</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on fundamental theory in this area, as well as on physical measurements made in test rigs, models have been developed and/or applied in order to investigate system function in the desired manner. The effect of deviations have then been shown and quantified, using results from simulations. The simulations show that thermostatic radiator valves are most effective in <b>low-flow</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Low-flow</b> <b>systems,</b> too, produce the lowest return temperatures. However, incorrect or changed radiator valve settings can result in substantial increased return temperature and differences in room temperatures in such systems. A direct connection of an air heater (that is without recirculation) presents the least risk of control instability, which means that performance tends to be more stable. In this respect, there is no difference whether the system is balanced for a high flow or a low flow. However, balancing does have a considerable effect on the control performance of valve groups with a recirculation connection and with <b>low-flow</b> <b>systems</b> running a greater risk of instability...|$|R

40|$|During the 2005 {{growing season}} two {{irrigation}} management practices were developed for cabbage production utilizing a Greenfield solar powered miniature pivot, {{located at the}} Canada-Saskatchewan Irrigation Diversification Centre (CSIDC) near Outlook, Saskatchewan. Solar and battery power was used to operate the drive and control system of the miniature centre pivot located on CSIDC’s pressurized pipeline. The management practices included a low-flow, 94 litres per minute (lpm) schedule with irrigation events occurring {{in the evening and}} night periods, and a high-flow, 370 lpm schedule with irrigation events occurring during the daytime hours. In each management practice, the soil moisture content was maintained above 65 % of field capacity to optimize yield and head development (Waterer 2005). Over the 2006 growing season, testing was conducted to evaluate the performance of each management practice. Performance was based upon application uniformity, water use efficiency and energy use efficiency. In addition to performance evaluation, tests were conducted to determine operational characteristics of this relatively new irrigation system to identify potential use in agricultural production. The uniformity coefficient of the high-flow management practice was greater than that of the low-flow management practice. This was a result of nozzle selection and layout of each application system, as determined by the manufacturer. Water use efficiency increased significantly when converting from a high-flow operating system to the <b>low-flow</b> <b>system.</b> This increase in water use efficiency was a result of reduced water loss, in the high flow system, through evaporation and potential run-off due to decreased application rates and environmental factors between watering times. Water loss through this manner is not beneficial to plant growth and results in elevated operating costs with little to no improvement in yield. Energy use efficiency, due to differences in water use efficiency and friction loss in the piping system, also increased upon switching from a high-flow system to the <b>low-flow</b> <b>system.</b> In general, converting this type of system from a high-flow management practice to a low-flow management practice will help conserve water and energy resulting in savings in operating and capital costs. Testing to determine the operating characteristics of the power system was completed during the 2006 growing season. It was concluded that these systems have potential use in operating small-scale pivot and pumping systems on high-value crops...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of two patient-dependent, variable performance techniques of oxygen therapy in relieving hypoxaemia after upper abdominal surgery was compared. A high-flow system delivered a humidified mixture of oxygen 2 litre min" 1 and air 13 litre min" 1 through a cannula {{inserted into the}} anterior nares. The <b>low-flow</b> <b>system</b> delivered 2 litre min" 1 of dry oxygen into the nasopharynx through a catheter. Thirteen otherwise healthy patients received either high-flow oxygen therapy for 30 min followed by low-flow oxygen therapy for a further 30 min after operation or the same therapy in reverse order. With the patients breathing room air, arterial hypoxaemia could be demonstrated with Paot inversely related to age. The increase of Pao, during either oxygen treat-ment was significantly greater with the low flow system. Impairment of arterial oxygenation in the period after operation is a common occurrence even in young patients without pre-existing respiratory or cardiovascular disease. The impairment is most profound and persistent after upper abdominal surgery and thoracotomy. However, arterial hyp-oxaemia seems an almost inevitable sequel to surgery requiring general anaesthesia for more than 20 min, despite normal Paco ^ cardiac output and oxygen consumption, and in absence of evident pulmonary complications. Extensive reviews on the subject have been presented (Sellery, 1968; Marshall and Wyche, 1972; Conway, 1975; Hewlett and Branthwaite, 1975).

40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors William Beckman and Sanford Klein; 243 pp. Low-flow solar hot water heating systems employ flow rates {{on the order of}} 1 / 5 to 1 / 10 of the conventional flow. <b>Low-flow</b> <b>systems</b> are of interest because the reduced flow rate allows smaller diameter tubing, which is less costly to install. Further, <b>low-flow</b> <b>systems</b> result in increased tank stratification. Lower collector inlet temperatures are achieved through stratification and the useful energy produced by the collector is increased. The disadvantage of <b>low-flow</b> <b>systems</b> is the collector heat removal factor, FR, decreases with decreasing flow rate. A serpentine collector has the potential to perform better than a conventional header-riser collector in <b>low-flow</b> <b>systems</b> due to the earlier onset of turbulent flow which enhances the internal heat transfer coefficient. The onset of turbulent flow {{is a function of the}} tube diameter and flow rate per tube. Many solar domestic hot water systems require an auxiliary electric source to operate a pump in order to circulate fluid through the solar collector. A photovoltaic driven pump can be used to replace the standard electrical pump. PV driven pumps provide an ideal means of controlling the flow rate, as pumps will only circulate fluid when there is sufficient radiation. The reduction of parasitic pumping power can also reduce on-peak utility demand. The PV pump, if adequately designed, decreases the system performance by a negligible amount. ii There has been some confusion as to whether optimum flow rates exist in a solar domestic hot water system utilizing a heat exchanger between the collector and the storage tank, as commonly employed for freeze protection. It was found that there exists thermal optimum or at least economical optimum flow rates when it is considered that low flow rates incur less hydraulic costs. Peak performance was always found to occur when the heat exchanger tank- side flow rate was approximately equal to the average load flow rate. For low collector-side flow rates, a small deviation from the optimum flow rate will dramatically effect system performance. However, system performance is insensitive to flow rate for high collector-side flow rates. Antifreeze solutions have temperature dependent properties such as density and specific heat. The effect of large temperature dependent property variations experienced by ethylene glycol and propylene glycol affect the optimum flow rate through the collector-side of the heat exchanger. The increased viscosity of the glycol at low temperatures impedes the onset of turbulence, which is detrimental to the heat exchanger UA...|$|R
40|$|Irrigation {{has been}} an {{essential}} part of Utah’s agriculture since pioneer days. Over half of Utah’s 1. 3 million irrigated acres are watered using surface methods such as flood, furrow, border, or basin irrigation. About 40 % of the irrigated acreage is under some form of sprinkler irrigation, including hand move, wheel move, center pivot, and other types. Low flow or micro-irrigation systems, including drip emitters, emitter tubes, drip tapes, bubblers and micro-sprinklers (sprays) are currently used on {{only a small fraction of}} the total irrigated area, but will become more common as water becomes more scarce and expensive. Currently, low flow and micro-irrigation is primarily used in orchards, vegetables and landscapes. When designed and operated properly, low flow or micro-irrigation systems apply water more efficiently and uniformly than sprinklers or surface irrigation systems, conserving water and generating higher yield per unit of water applied. Most <b>low-flow</b> <b>systems</b> are designed to operate at pressures of 10 to 25 pounds per square inch (psi). Municipal water systems typically deliver water at 50 to 70 psi. Water pressure can be tested with a pressure gage designed for water systems. Some gages are designed to test static pressure and can be fastened directly onto the hose bib or pipe. Other gauges are designed to test the pressure of flowing water, such as in a sprinkler nozzle, by inserting the tester directly into the stream of water. Simple pressure gages can be purchased at a local plumbing or irrigation supply store. For most <b>low-flow</b> <b>systems,</b> a pressure reducer will need to be installed to provide the manufacturer-recommended pressures for low-flow components and fittings.

Extracorporeal CO 2 removal based on renal replacement platforms {{may be especially}} useful in mechanically ventilated patients with multi-organ failure, since in one- to two-thirds of those patients there is an indication for renal replacement therapy [28, 29]. Furthermore, concomitant lung and kidney injury may exhibit significant detrimental interaction (“organ cross talk”) [30, 31], which may negatively affect outcome. Because no additional vascular access other than the dialysis catheter is required, {{the implementation of a}} hollow-fiber gas exchanger in the renal replacement circuit could be an attractive therapeutic option in such patients.|$|R

Experiences of <b>low-flow</b> <b>systems</b> from several countries are related, and the conclusion is drawn that the maximum theoretical possible increase in performance of 20 % has not been achieved due to poor heat exchangers and poor stratification in the storage tanks. Positive developments in connecting tubes and pumps is noted. Further participation as observer in Task 14 meetings is desired, and is looked on favourably by the members of the group.

40|$|Volatile {{agents are}} {{economically}} and ecologically acceptable only when administered via <b>low-flow</b> <b>systems.</b> However, sevoflurane degrades during low-flow anaesthesia to compound A, {{and a high}} carbon dioxide absorber temperature increases this degradation. This thesis {{suggests that there is}} a correlation between apparatus dead-space volume and absorber temperature during low- and minimal-flow sevoflurane anaesthesia. Increasing the dead-space volume reduces absorber temperature during low- and minimal-flow sevoflurane anaesthesia. The main disadvantage of low-flow techniques is that inspired (In) and end-tidal (Et) anaesthetic agent concentrations are not directly related to the vaporiser setting. In the present studies, with desflurane and sevoflurane, {{there was a significant difference}} between Et and In concentrations at fresh gas flows (FGFs) of 1. 0 and 2. 0 l/min. However, the ratio of Et to In concentration remained fairly constant. Excessive respiratory heat loss may lower body temperature. Artificial humidification of dry inspired gases reduces loss of body heat during anaesthesia, hence the popularity of heat and moisture exchangers (HMEs). In this study, HMEs improved the humidity of the anaesthetic gases at different FGFs, but did not improve maintenance of body temperature during low-flow anaesthesia in adults undergoing elective general or urologic surgery...|$|R

40|$|A {{breathing}} system {{is defined as}} an assembly of components, which delivers gases from the anesthesia machine to the patients′ airways. When the components are arranged as a circle, it is termed a circle system. The flow of exhaled gases is unidirectional in the system. The system contains a component (absorber), which absorbs exhaled carbon dioxide {{and it is not}} necessary to give high fresh gas flows as in Mapleson systems. When the adjustable pressure limiting (APL) valve is closed and all the exhaled gases without carbon dioxide are returned to the patient, the system becomes a totally closed one. Such a circle system can be used with flows as low as 250 to 500 mL and clinically can be termed as <b>low-flow</b> <b>systems.</b> The components of the circle system can be arranged in different ways with adherence to basic rules: (1) Unidirectional valve must be present between the reservoir bag and the patient on both inspiratory and expiratory sides; (2) fresh gas must not enter the system between the expiratory unidirectional valve and the patient; and (3) the APL valve must not be placed between the patient and the inspiratory unidirectional valve. The functional analysis is explained in detail. During the function, the arrangement of components is significant only at higher fresh gas flows. With the introduction of low resistance valves, improved soda lime canisters and low dead space connectors, the use of less complicated pediatric circle systems is gaining popularity to anesthetize children.

40|$|Our {{studies suggest}} that the {{perfusion}} rates of canine intestinal segments during extracorporeal perfusion are directly related to the quality of preservation; namely, better preserved specimens exhibit higher perfusion rates and vice versa. Production of intraluminal fluid (ILF) during preservation and following revascularization is related to the quality of preservation. Poorly preserved intestine seems generally to produce more fluid than well preserved specimens. Conversely, continuous pulsatile perfusion techniques resulted in more ILF production than specimens perfused with <b>low-flow</b> gravity-dependent <b>systems.</b> Ex vivo intestinal perfusion resulted in organ oedema inversely proportional to the quality of preservation. Poor preservation is also associated with washout of potassium, lactic dehydrogenase, and tissue acidosis both during preservation and revascularization. Perfusion with a high concentration of potassium ions results in poor preservation presumably owing to vasoconstriction. Mucosal malperfusion as demonstrated by the Microfil technique is the circulatory abnormality most closely associated with inadequate preservation.

40|$|Coastal {{wetlands}} and rivermouth lagoons are dynamic systems, which respond rapidly to sea-level, tectonic, meteorological, anthropogenic and other synergistic drivers. This research used a multi-disciplinary approach to investigate two representative West Coast lagoon systems (Totara Lagoon and the Shearer Swamp-Waikoriri Lagoon Complex) {{in order to}} document their present-day geomorphology and determine the development and processes acting on these systems over historical time. This information was then used to predict their future under varying climate, development and management pressures. In addition to adding to the West Coast knowledge base, {{the findings of this}} research are applicable to similar systems elsewhere in New Zealand and internationally. This investigation used a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the dynamics, structure, development and active processes in the two study systems. Techniques to document current hydrology and topography included hydrological records of water level, temperature and conductivity, and Global Navigation Satellite Surveys (GNSS). Outlet dynamics over a decadal scale were investigated through temporal aerial photograph analysis, and sediment core analyses showed changes occurring over longer timescales. Significant differences in morphology and dynamics were observed between Totara Lagoon and Waikoriri Lagoon, with the former being much larger, more stable, and less dynamic in terms of dune morphology and outlet migratory patterns. Hydrologically, Totara Lagoon is currently in an estuarine phase, and experiences significant tidal inflows, which demonstrates the connectivity between definitions of coastal lagoons and estuaries. Waikoriri Lagoon is freshwater, and can be described as a hapua-type system, but exhibits very different river flow and barrier composition to East Coast examples. Sediment core analyses from Shearer Swamp and northern Totara Lagoon showed little change over a decadal to centennial scale, but evidence of a change in margin dynamics in response to farming and stabilisation of adjacent dune ridges was observed in Shearer Swamp. Results suggest landward migration of the southern end of Totara Lagoon occurred over this timeframe. The future of these systems depends on the interaction between climate and anthropogenic (including management) factors. A conceptual model of process and response suggests three possible resultant scenarios: lagoon loss, natural lagoon, or artificially modified lagoon. A significant finding of this research is the recognition that some systems exist on a continuum between a hapua and an estuary, switching hydrological states through time while maintaining consistent morphology. In addition, the importance of barrier permeability in hapua formation is highlighted, and the term ‘sandy hapua’ introduced to distinguish these <b>low-flow</b> <b>systems</b> with low barrier permeability from the typical mixed sand and gravel examples documented on the East Coast. These findings enhance scientific understanding of rivermouth lagoon systems, and demonstrate the wide spectrum of conditions under which they may form. This process-based understanding is important from a coastal management perspective as concerns of human induced climate change and accelerated sea level rise grow...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce comsumption of inhalational anaesthetsics during high flow {{anaesthesia}} a system open in regard to oxygen, nitogen and nitrous oxide, but closed to inhalational anaesthetics, was developed. This was achieved by a reflecting filter for inhalational anaesthetics made of active carbon. The principle has been developed into the commersially available Anesthetic Conserving Device (ACD, AnaConDa®). The ACD is a modified heat- and moisture exchanger (HME) containing av bacterial and viral filter {{as well as a}} carbon filter. The ACD can be used during surgery for administering the inhalational agents isoflurane and sevoflurane as an alternative to <b>low-flow</b> anaesthesia <b>systems.</b> It can also be used in intensive care units to administer sedation using isoflurane or sevoflurane to critically ill patients. The thesis is based on four papers. In paper I it is shown that that the wash-in kinetics for sevoflurane delivered by the ACD is similar to a vaporiser. With the ACD, end-tidal sevoflurane accurately reflects arterial sevoflurane tension whereas inspired tension may be underesteimated. Despite an increase in tidal volume of patients in a group with an ACD corresponding to the larger internal volume of the device compared to a conventional HME, the PaCO 2 was considerably higher in this group. In paper II CO 2 exchange and airway dead space is compared using an HME, ACD without reflecting filter and ACD with reflecting filter in a laboratory set-up. It is shown that the ACD binds CO 2 resulting in a dead space effect 180 ml in excess of its internal volume. This is due to adsorption of CO 2 in the ACD during expiration and return of CO 2 during the following inspiration. In paper III the ACD is used without inhalational anaesthetics in patients as well as in a laboratory set-up with varying temperature and humidity. It is confirmed that an ACD used in humans as well as in a test lung increases the dead space effect and CO 2 rebreathing {{to a greater extent than}} can be explained by its internal volume. This is caused by adsorption of CO 2 in the ACD during expiration and release of CO 2 during inspiration. It is also shown that rebreathing of CO 2 is attenuated but not abolished by humidity. In paper IV the ACD is used with sevoflurane in humans and in a laboratory set-up. It is shown that sevoflurane attenuates but does not abolish rebreathing of CO 2, thereby reducing the dead space effect of the ACD. In conlusion, the ACD causes a dead space effect larger than its internal volume due to CO 2 rebreathing. This may influence the clinical use of the ACD...|$|R
40|$|Vegetative {{treatment}} areas (VTA) {{are commonly}} used as an alternative means of treating agricultural wastewater. Little information exists regarding {{the effectiveness of these}} VTAs at removing nutrients in the subsurface. Furthermore, current design methods and recommendations do not fully incorporate hydrological processes that govern likelihood of soil saturation and surface discharge. The first study utilized an applied tracer and a simple binary mixing model within two VTAs to characterize incoming wastewater movement following an event. Results demonstrated that concentrated surface flow paths existed within both VTAs. Rapid preferential flow to shallow monitoring wells was also observed. A shallow restrictive layer (i. e. fragipan) likely exacerbated surface flow but restricted runoff movement to deeper groundwater. A more comprehensive VTA design process is called for that accounts for shallow soils and antecedent moisture conditions. The importance of regular maintenance and design measures to prevent the formation of concentrated flow paths to prevent surface discharge was made apparent. The second study investigated subsurface nutrient removal within three VTAs (WNY, CNY-East, and CNY-West) receiving silage bunker runoff. This {{was one of the first}} studies performed on VTAs receiving this type of wastewater. Conservative tracer and nutrient data from a monitoring well network within each VTA were used to calculate mass balances. Mass removal of ammonium in all three VTAs was over 60 %. Very little nitrate entered or exited any of the VTAs. Removal of soluble reactive phosphorus varied, and actually increased in one VTA where soluble reactive phosphorus loading was relatively low. Results also demonstrated that nutrient reduction mechanisms other than vegetative uptake can be significant within VTAs and that groundwater impairment from leaching of nitrate beneath the VTAs was not likely. Results highlighted the importance of capturing concentrated <b>low-flows</b> in VTA <b>systems.</b> The third study built upon the findings of the first study. An existing model was modified and adapted for VTA design and/or site evaluation. This model accounts for soil depth and cumulative rainfall. It was calibrated using continuous groundwater elevations collected within a VTA. It is available in an easy-to-use format and is a significant improvement over current design methods...|$|R
40|$|Mine wastewaters {{generated}} during active production operations, and decanting streams following mine closure {{have major}} environmental impacts, and volumes requiring treatment {{are expected to}} increase substantially as the South African mining industry matures. Biological treatment of mine waters {{has been the subject}} of increasing interest, where sulphate reducing bacteria are employed for the reduction of sulphate to sulphide, precipitation of metals and the production of alkalinity. However, the sulphide if not removed from the system can be oxidised back to sulphate. As a result there have been limitations especially in the provision of technological options that are sustainable over the long-term, where the total sulphur (in its different forms) can be removed from the system. These, however, are the subject of a number of constraints including, importantly, the process capability to remove reduced sulphur from the treated stream, in one of its oxidation states, and thus linearise the biological sulphur cycle. This remains a major bottleneck in the development of biological wastewater treatment technology. Floating sulphur biofilms are observed as surface layers in numerous aquatic sulphide-rich environments, and it has been suggested that they play a role in the biological cycling of sulphur. The use of sulphur biofilms for the removal of elemental sulphur was identified in this study as a possible means for addressing the technological bottleneck, especially in passive wastewater treatment systems. There is, however, little documented information in the literature on the structure of floating sulphur biofilms, the microbial species responsible for their occurrence or bio-process applications of the system. A linear flow channel reactor was developed to simulate natural conditions and enabled the study of floating sulphur biofilm under controlled laboratory conditions. It was observed that these biofilms developed through three distinct stages termed Thin, Sticky and Brittle films. A microprobe study showed the presence of a steep Redox gradient established across (260 to 380 μm) depth of the floating sulphur biofilm of ~ 0 to - 200 mV (top to bottom), which correlated with pH and sulphide gradients across the system. Structural investigations embedded in an exopolymeric matrix containing clearly defined channels and pores. Sulphur crystals were found to develop within the biofilm and above a certain size these disengaged and then settled in the liquid phase below the biofilm. These features, together with the ability of the biofilm to remain suspended at the air/water interface thus provide the surface requirement, and indicate that these structures may be understood as “true” biofilms. In order to study an apparent functional differentiation within the floating sulphur biofilm system, a method was developed to expand its various components over a 13 cm length of agarose tube and across which an oxygen/sulphide gradient was established. This was done by inserting a sulphide plug in the bottom of the tube, overlaying this with the biofilm mixed and suspended in agarose and leaving the tube to open air. After allowing for growth, the different components of the microbial population occurring at various levels across the oxygen/sulphide gradient were sampled. The microbial population was found to resort in distinct functional layers. Aerobes including Acidithiobacillus and Azoarcus, Acidithiobacillus, Thiothrix, Thiovirga and Sulfurimonas were found in the upper oxidised layer. Aerobe and facultative anaerobes such as Chryseobacterium, Bacteroides and Planococcus were found in the middle and heterotrophic anaerobes such as Brevundimonas and uncultured anaerobes were found in the bottom anoxic layer. This enabled the development of a first descriptive structural/functional model accounting for the performance of floating sulphur biofilms. The potential of the floating sulphur biofilm for use as a bioprocess unit operation for sulphide removal in lignocellulose-based <b>low-flow</b> passive <b>systems</b> for acid mine drainage wastewater treatment was investigated. The linear flow channel reactor was scaled up and it was shown that the optimum sulphide removal of 74 % and sulphur recovery of 60 % could be achieved at 20 °C. In a further scale up of the linear channel reactor, the floating sulphur biofilm reactor was developed and operated. Sulphide removal and sulphur recovery of 65 and 56 % respectively was measured in the process. An understanding of the nature and function of floating sulphur biofilms and the further development of their potential application in sulphide removal in aquatic systems may provide a useful contribution to the treatment of acid mine drainage and other sulphidic wastewaters...|$|R
