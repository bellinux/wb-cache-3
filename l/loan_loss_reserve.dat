40|$|Loan loss {{provision}} {{is an important}} concept in banking. That is, it helps banks to prevent credit risk, manage regulatory capital, smooth income and maintain financial system stability. This paper seeks to examine loan loss provision determinants in Chinese banks using 110 bank-year observations over the period of 2001 - 2010. Ratio analysis, Random Effects model and the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) Estimator method are used to assist our analysis. The finding suggests that Chinese banks on average follow an income smoothing practice. Both the total loan ratio and non-performing loan ratio are significantly in deciding <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio due to the regulator: China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) ’s provisioning policy. The GDP growth rate is positively related with the <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio and implies that the Chinese banking system is not pro-cyclical and banks’ provisioning behaviour is a forward looking risk assessment over the business cycle. The lagged dependent variable is significant; indicating that on average Chinese banks will adjust their <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio based on the level in the previous year. In addition, the Chinese banks samples {{do not support the}} capital management hypothesis and are not affected by bank size. In terms of the dummy variables, consolidated banking group has higher <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio than non-consolidated banking group on average. There is no evidence indicating differences are existing in loan loss provisioning behavior among different types of banks in China...|$|E

This study compares the lender’s loan loss estimates to a distribution of losses with associated probabilities.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the tightening of accounting constraints {{associated with the}} SunTrust bank decision in 1998 impacted the <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserve</b> policies of banks differently based on ownership structure. The SunTrust case, {{the result of an}} SEC inquiry over possible overstating of loan loss reserves, represented a strengthening of accounting priorities, which stress the importance of the reserve account for financial statement objectivity and comparability, relative to supervisory priorities, which emphasize the role of reserves for bank solvency through changing economic environments. The evidence presented indicates that publicly held banks, which fall directly under the SECs purview, reduced their <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserve</b> and provisions relative to privately held banks. Evidence also indicates that the positive relationship between bank earnings and provisions weakened, consistent with a reduction in either earnings management or early recognition of losses...|$|E

40|$|Regulatory capital {{guidelines}} {{allow for}} <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserves</b> {{to be added}} back as capital. The evidence in this paper suggests that the influence of <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserves</b> added back as regulatory capital (hereafter referred to as “add-backs”) on bank risk cannot be explained by either economic principles underlying the notion of capital, or accounting principles underlying the recording of reserves. Specifically, we observe that {{in sharp contrast to}} the economic notion of capital as a buffer against bank failure risk, add-backs are positively associated with the risk of bank failure during the recent economic crisis. Further the positive association of add-backs with bank failure risk is concentrated among cases in which the add-backs are highly likely to increase a bank’s total regulatory capital. The evidence cannot thus be fully explained by accounting principles either, since the role of <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserves</b> according to those principles does not depend on whether the reserves generate a regulatory capital increase. Additional analysis suggests that the observed influence of <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserves</b> on bank failure risk may be an unintended consequence of their regulatory treatment as capital...|$|R

40|$|Few {{works were}} {{interested}} in the procyclical character of the provisioning policy. However, the accounting practices as regards provisioning of the <b>loans</b> <b>losses</b> adopted by banks fluctuate with the business cycle and can reinforce financial instability. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine whether and to what extent provisioning policy are procyclical. We focus on the interaction between business cycle and provisioning policy (<b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserves</b> and <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> provisions) consistent with the Basel Accord of 1988 which made <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserves</b> no longer part of Tier I capital in the numerator of the capital adequacy ratio. An empirical model on panel data is then adapted on European banks from 1992 to 2004. In this model we consider two types of provisioning policy determinants: <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> provisions and <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserves.</b> We identify banks with different strategies and different characteristics based on the ratio of non interest income in total revenue. We find that large banks tend to hold less risk. They establish fewer reserves than small banks. However, our results provide that functional diversification have no impact on provisioning policy. We also find that risk weighted assets reduce the volatility of the provisioning policy (<b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> provisions and <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserves)</b> during the cycle. The findings of our research are consistent with the empirical work of Bikker and Hu (2002), Laeven and Majnoni (2003), of Bikker and Metzemakers (2005) who show that banks more fund <b>loans</b> <b>losses</b> in period of economic downturn than in period of economic upturn for a whole of the OECD countries...|$|R

40|$|Our study {{focuses on}} {{commercial}} banks which are operating in Bulgaria and Romania, two countries whose banking sectors have registered major structural {{changes in the}} transition to a market economy and which are showing some similarities. Similar to other EU countries, the financial system from Bulgaria and Romania is dominated by the banking sector, which holds the largest share of total assets. Thus, we can say that health, strength and performance of the banking sector are of major importance for the sustainable economic development of states, but also for efficient transmission of monetary policy decisions on the real economy. The paper aims to identify the key factors that affect bank profitability and to evaluate empirically their contribution to a sample of 29 commercial banks in Bulgaria and Romania, for the period 2003 - 2012. Our research is based on data from the Bureau Van Dijk database, the World Bank and the European Central Bank and uses panel data estimation techniques. The dependent variable used in our study is the bank profitability, which is measured by two representative indicators the Return on Average Assets (ROAA) and Return on Average Equity (ROAE). Regarding the independent variables, our analysis includes capital adequacy, the <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserve</b> rate, cost to income ratio, the ratio of liquid assets to total assets, the interest expenses to deposits ratio, the non-interest income over total gross revenues, bank size, the GDP per capita growth, inflation rate, domestic bank credit to private sector and banking industry concentration. The results of our empirical study shows that among the variables considered, the <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserve</b> rate, the ratio of cost to income, GDP per capita growth and domestic bank credit to the private sector, {{have a significant impact on}} bank profitability, results in line with our expectations, but also with the results of other empirical studies...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{the determinants of}} profitability using an unbalanced panel of 78 East Asian and 89 Latin American banks for the period 2003 - 2014. We regress profitability against bank-specific variables (capital adequacy, cost-income ratio, liquidity ratio, <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio, and bank size) and macroeconomic variables (gross domestic product, inflation and bank concentration). Our dynamic panel regression model suggests that bank profitability in East Asia is determined by more bank-specific variables than macroeconomic variables; the reverse, however, applies to Latin America. We contribute to current literature by: 1) using a more robust profitability measure (risk-adjusted returns); 2) employing both bank-specific and macroeconomic variables; 3) studying two large and fast-developing regions of East Asia and Latin America. Our findings enhance our theoretical and practical knowledge of bank-specific profitability determinants. It also enables policy makers to deliberate on the pertinent macroeconomic determinants such as inflation and concentration ratio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{analyses}} {{what are}} the determinants of China’s commercial bank performances, and whether shareholding reformation improves bank performance. Return on average assets (ROAA), return on average equities (ROAE) and net profit margin (NIM) are employed {{as a measure of}} bank performance, individually. I investigate the unbalanced panel data of 17 China national commercial banks, includes the “big four” SOCBs and 13 national joint stock banks from 2001 to 2008. Two models are established. To estimate these two models, both fixed/ random effect approach, and system GMM approach are employed. I find that, for both models, cost to income ratio, equity to total assets ratio, and <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserve</b> to gross loans ratio are important determinants of bank performance when I employ ROAA and NIM as a indictor of bank performance. Macroeconomic economic environments influence the bank performance in the form of net interest margin.

Furthermore, the impact of macroeconomic shocks on the <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserves</b> ratio has become stronger (both in terms of magnitude and statistical significance) following the outbreak of the Greek sovereign debt crisis. From a macro policy perspective, this result indicates that a sustainable stabilization of macroeconomic conditions is a key precondition for safeguarding domestic financial stability.

40|$|Through {{my summer}} 1987 {{internship}} in accountancy at Continental Bank of Chicago, IL, I {{was exposed to}} some of the accounting-related topics that are faced by the banking industry. One of the most relevant topics to today's economy is loan loss reserves. A <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserve</b> is an estimate of the total potential principal loss inherent in a bank's loan portfolio as of a certain date. It is the role of bank management to perform the highly judgmental process of determining the amount that should be in the reserve. During the bank's annual audit, the independent auditor has the difficult role of determining the adequacy of the reserves. Both bank management and internal auditors are facing pressure from various organizations to determine the most accurate estimate. Auditors are even facing lawsuits.

Many banks are going out of business because they have not been facing the economic realities of the debt problem through building up their loan loss reserves. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|E

If the decision of issuing sub-debt is endogenous and/or subordinated creditors are really able to influence bank managers’ behavior, {{we should be able}} to detect empirically a positive correlation between the amount of sub-debt held in bank balance sheets and banking performance. By conducting statistical tests on a panel dataset comprising the largest European banks, we find that: (i) the sub-debt issues are made generally by the most profitable banking organizations; (ii) voluntary sub-debt issues allow banks to reduce their Tier 1 ratios, while improving their overall capitalization (Tier 1 + Tier 2 ratios); (iii) as far as the risk profile is concerned, the amount of sub-debt held in bank balance sheet is negatively correlated with the quality of credit portfolio, but positively correlated with the ratio of <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserve</b> to total (gross) loans.

40|$|Abstract—With the {{drafting}} of new banking regulation via the Basel II capital accord, bank regulatory capital and its adequacy has become {{the subject of much}} debate. In our contribution, we strive to construct a stochastic dynamic model to describe the evolution of bank capital that incorporates capital gains and losses. In our paper, such gains and losses are represented by <b>loan</b> <b>loss</b> <b>reserves</b> and the unexpected <b>loan</b> <b>losses,</b> respectively. In this regard, we recognize that bank capital consists of Tier 1 capital (mainly equity which is modeled via an exponential Lévy process), Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital (collectively known as supplementary capital). The latter two types of capital mainly consist of (short- and long-term) subordinate debt held by debtholders and <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> <b>reserves.</b> Furthermore, we setup an optimal capital management problem which maximizes the expectation of bank capital under a risk constraint on the Capital-at-Risk (CaR), where CaR is defined in terms of Valueat-Risk (VaR). In particular, we seek an optimal bank capital management strategy in a mean-CaR paradigm. Historical evidence from Organization for Economic Corporation and Development (OCED) countries assists us in establishing the relationship between output gap (as the proxy of business cycle) and capital adequacy ratios (CARs). Finally, we provide a brief analysis of some of the optimal capital management issues and suggestions for topics of possible future direction...|$|R
