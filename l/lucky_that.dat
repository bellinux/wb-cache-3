5|$|We {{took off}} from the {{concrete}} runway in Leck, Kirchner (Fhj.Fw Günther Kirchner) stayed 30 metres behind me on my right side as usual;... We climbed up to about 200 metres, when suddenly two Thunderbolts appeared behind us and instantly shot down Günther Kirchner's plane. I saw him jettison canopy and catapult but his parachute did not deploy. I was very <b>lucky</b> <b>that</b> the Thunderbolts did not press on with another attack.|$|E
5|$|About {{a talent}} for composition... I can say nothing as yet. You have tried your powers too little... Yes, one can study on one's own. Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study... All of us, that is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I consider myself <b>lucky</b> <b>that</b> I bethought myself in time and forced myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E
5|$|The Lions {{rushed for}} 190yards, while holding the Buccaneers to 47. Lions quarterback Chuck Long was 12 of 23 for 108yards and a touchdown, while Testaverde was 20–39 for 262yards and a touchdown. The Lions intercepted Testaverde once and sacked him four times, as they broke a four-game losing streak. Testaverde was <b>lucky</b> <b>that</b> {{it was not}} worse, as three of his {{potential}} turnovers were called back due to Lions penalties. On another two occasions, balls that bounced off of his receivers' fingertips wound up caught by other Buccaneer receivers.|$|E

5|$|Out {{of respect}} for the seriously-injured Bianchi, the top three {{finishers}} did not spray champagne. At the podium interviews, conducted by the 1992 World Champion Nigel Mansell, Hamilton said that it had been a difficult race weekend and his speed {{near the end of the}} race was reminiscent of the 2008 British Grand Prix. Rosberg called it a good weekend for his team, and congratulated Hamilton on the victory. Vettel said that he was <b>lucky</b> <b>that</b> the safety car came out, and was happy with his performance. At a later press conference, Hamilton said that he was confident in his car's balance when he passed Rosberg on lap 28, and saw no difference in the amount of standing water on the track when more heavy rain fell. Although Rosberg's car was set up similar to Hamilton's, he was unhappy with its balance and tried to adjust it during his pit stop. According to Vettel, the weather was borderline and his team decided to make a pit stop when it deteriorated.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Walter Skinner {{was played}} by actor Mitch Pileggi, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for {{the roles of}} two or three other characters on The X-Files before getting the part. At first, {{the fact that he was}} asked back to audition for the recurring role slightly puzzled him, until he discovered the reason he had not previously been cast in those roles—Carter had been unable to envision Pileggi as any of those characters, because the actor had been shaving his head. When Pileggi auditioned for Walter Skinner, he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his small amount of hair to grow. His attitude fit well with Skinner's character, causing Carter to assume that the actor was only pretending to be grumpy. Pileggi later realized he had been <b>lucky</b> <b>that</b> he had not been cast in one of the earlier roles, as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would have missed the opportunity to play the recurring role.|$|E

Several ships, including the Guernsey lifeboat, were machine gunned by German aircraft however with enemy aircraft and submarines operating in the Channel, it was <b>lucky</b> <b>that</b> no evacuation ship was sunk.|$|E

25|$|On {{the left}} flank, Simon's brigade got lost and {{was unable to}} join Paillard's brigade at the old Otterberg glassworks until that evening. By then {{it was too late to}} mount an attack, so the 29th was Ambert's day to miss the action. Ambert had to march all night to rejoin the French main force. Unknown to the French, Kospoth's {{division}} marched south from Lauterecken to Schallodenbach, from which the Prussian could attack Ambert in the rear. So it was <b>lucky</b> <b>that</b> the French left wing shifted position. On the right flank Taponier assaulted the Galgenberg but was unable to make any headway. The Prussian left wing was supported by artillery fire from the Kaiserberg. Brunswick directed Wartensleben at Trippstadt to march to Kaiserslautern with three battalions and 10 squadrons. During the day, Wartensleben's troops reinforced the Duke of Saxe-Weimar's position on the Galgenberg and helped drive Taponier's men back into the woods.|$|E

Audiences appreciate these cynical characters. It helps parents and adults {{to go along with}} the journey." [...] Dinklage's prosthetics took three hours to apply, and restricted his performance to his eyes. Even his frown was built into the make-up. On his first day of filming, he was bitten by sand flies and fell into a river. [...] "We were <b>lucky</b> <b>that</b> he returned after his first day!" [...] recalled Johnson.|$|E

500|$|The idea {{of using}} [...] "Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight" [...] {{originated}} when an anonymous sent Hillenburg a tape with [...] "a bunch of music." [...] While the writers were developing the show outside Nickelodeon, Hillenburg played the song for Drymon {{as an example of}} the enthusiasm he was looking for. When it came time to write the pilot, they had the idea to use the song in the third act. The crew eventually got the rights to use the song for the pilot, but all they had was [...] "the crummy copy on Steve's old tape." [...] The writers were able to use the music, as one of the women who worked at Nickelodeon at the time [...] "knew somebody somewhere who had access to something," [...] and she brought in a copy of the song on CD. Drymon said [...] "We were totally <b>lucky</b> <b>that</b> she had the contact, otherwise we wouldn't have been able to use it. The sad part was Tiny Tim died right around the time we were writing the pilot, so he never knew we used his song." ...|$|E

The live performance saw her wearing a silver bodysuit and then being carried by her crotch by one of her male dancers and lowered onto another male dancer, engaging in a threesome with them. During the performance at San Diego, California, Gaga incorporated the city's name in the song, later commenting [...] "I am so <b>lucky</b> <b>that</b> San Diego rhymes with 'Fernando' and 'Alejandro'." [...] Ted Shaw of Windsor Star commented that [...] "Songs like 'Alejandro', 'Teeth' and 'Monster' shoved the sex act in your face." [...] T'Cha Dunlevy from The Gazette said that [...] "the song followed in fast order, with not quite enough to set [...] apart. It was one choreographed dance number after the next." [...] Jeremy Adams from Rolling Stone commented that the performance was [...] " [...] of several moments [...] that gave parents in the audience consternation." [...] Jim Harrington from San Jose Mercury News compared Gaga's performance of the song with that of an erotic dancer.|$|E
