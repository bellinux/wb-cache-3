40|$|Examines the {{relationship}} between the <b>library</b> <b>service</b> and the local community in Northern Ireland, using Portadown as a case study. A review of the literature explores complex links between the concepts of social disadvantage and political division and violence, as the <b>library</b> <b>service</b> must function within a community where deep divisions exist. Librarians and local groups from both communities were interviewed individually, and in focus groups, to explore their perceptions of the current role and function of the <b>library</b> <b>service</b> in such a deeply divided town. Amongst the findings was the perception by local people that social and political barriers existed, preventing optimum use of the public <b>library</b> <b>service</b> by all sectors of the community. Furthermore, the emphasis on traditional aspects of <b>library</b> <b>service</b> meant that local groups were circumventing the <b>library</b> <b>service</b> and setting up their own community information provision. Thus, unless the <b>library</b> <b>service</b> could become more fully integrated into the whole community, it would become increasingly marginalised within such a community. Peer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|In 1906, the Multnomah County Library began distributing {{books to}} neighborhoods outside {{downtown}} Portland. A reading room {{was established in}} the Woodstock neighborhood's fire station building in 1908; later that year it was recognized as a branch of Multnomah County Library. Deposit stations, containing packing crates that turned into two-shelf bookcases holding up to 50 books each, were often set up within fire stations or private homes. Woodstock received its deposit station, a collection of children's books housed within a public school, in 1909, becoming one of fifteen outlying service areas. On May 16, 1911, the Woodstock deposit station was replaced by a sub-branch library, supplying more reading material for adults and children but without the reference works and other <b>library</b> <b>services</b> offered at regular branches. The collection was moved to a larger storefront facility, west of SE 44th on SE Woodstock Boulevard, on September 12, 1914. The library achieved full branch status in 1917, offering a collection and services comparable to other branches. In 1918, the Woodstock branch and several others were threatened with closure after employees received a $10 per month salary increase, but funding sources helped to defray the additional expense. Along with other county libraries, the branch closed between November 1 and November 16 in response to the 1918 flu pandemic.|$|E

25|$|In 1977 the {{libraries}} of the faculties of Sciences, Economic Sciences, and Engineering, {{all three}} {{located within the}} same campus, were merged into the Integrated Library of Sciences, Economics and Engineering (BIECI for its acronym in Spanish). This was the first unification of different <b>library</b> <b>services</b> that took place within the University. A project proposal for taking this initiative {{to a higher level}} was put forth the University Council a couple of years later. The project submitted the comprehensive integration of all the university’s <b>library</b> <b>services</b> into a greater single one. It was swiftly approved on March 6, 1980 and the resulting body was simply named University of Los Andes <b>Library</b> <b>Services</b> (SERBIULA). SERBIULA had and still has the responsibility of integrating all the existing <b>library</b> <b>services</b> and keeping them up-to-date with the University demands. Additionally, SERBIULA created and manages the university’s Library System, whose coordination follows a decentralized approach as a consequence of having the University campuses scattered all around the city.

40|$|This study {{consisted}} of an examination of how service quality should be measured within libraries and how <b>library</b> <b>service</b> quality relates to library success. A {{modified version of the}} SERVQUAL instrument was evaluated to determine how effectively it measures <b>library</b> <b>service</b> quality. Instruments designed to measure information center success and information system success were evaluated to determine how effectively they measure library success and how they relate to SERVQUAL. A model of library success was developed to examine how <b>library</b> <b>service</b> quality relates to other variables associated with library success. Responses from 385 end users at two U. S. Army Corps of Engineers libraries were obtained through a mail survey. Results indicate that <b>library</b> <b>service</b> quality is best measured with a performance-based version of SERVQUAL, and that measuring importance may be as critical as measuring expectations for management purposes. Results also indicate that <b>library</b> <b>service</b> quality {{is an important factor in}} library success and that library success is best measured with a combination of SERVQUAL and library success instruments. The findings have implications for the development of new instruments to more effectively measure <b>library</b> <b>service</b> quality and <b>library</b> success as well as for the development of new models of <b>library</b> <b>service</b> quality and <b>library</b> success...|$|R
