5|$|Beauchamp was {{admitted}} to the bar in April 1823. He and Anna Cooke married in June 1824. Still determined to defend the honor of his wife, Beauchamp devised a ruse to lure Sharp to Bowling Green. He wrote letters to Sharp under various pseudonyms, each asking for his help in some sort of <b>legal</b> <b>matter,</b> and each sent from a different post office. When Sharp failed to respond, Beauchamp decided to go to Frankfort again and confront him.|$|E

25|$|What {{is crucial}} in setting the level of {{formality}} in any legal document is assessing the needs and expectations of the audience. For example, an appellate brief to the highest court in a jurisdiction calls for a formal style—this shows proper respect for the court and for the <b>legal</b> <b>matter</b> at issue. An interoffice legal memorandum to a supervisor can probably be less formal—though not colloquial—because it is an in-house decision-making tool, not a court document. And an email message to a friend and client, updating {{the status of a}} <b>legal</b> <b>matter,</b> is appropriately informal.|$|E

25|$|Persuasive {{writing is}} the most rhetorically stylized. So {{although}} a brief states the legal issues, describes authorities, and applies authorities to the question—as does a memorandum—the brief's application portion is framed as an argument. The author argues for one approach to resolving the <b>legal</b> <b>matter</b> and does not present a neutral analysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{judicial}} system in Ontario is officially bilingual in all areas, although {{in some parts}} of the province a <b>legal</b> <b>matter</b> involving francophones may have to be transferred to another region where francophone services are more readily available.

25|$|Randi met magician Uri Geller in {{the early}} 1970s, and found Geller to be “Very charming. Likable, beautiful, affectionate, genuine, forward-going, {{handsome}} — everything!” But Randi viewed Geller as a con-man, and began a long effort to expose him as a fraud. According to Randi, Geller tried to sue him several times, accusing him of libel. Geller never won, save for a ruling in a Japanese court that ordered Randi to pay Geller one third {{of one percent of}} what Geller had requested. This ruling was canceled, and the matter dropped, when Geller decided to concentrate on another <b>legal</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|E
25|$|Noted {{earlier this}} is a state form of bankruptcy, not federal form.

This is not asserted to diminish an attorney’s capabilities, but to stress the legal niche that this legal instrument falls within, bankruptcy. Non legal staff familiar with bankruptcy and the assignment process can also affect the speed validity of the process.|$|E

25|$|Pasteur {{produced}} the first vaccine for rabies by growing {{the virus in}} rabbits, and then weakening it by drying the affected nerve tissue. The rabies vaccine was initially created by Emile Roux, a French doctor and a colleague of Pasteur, who had produced a killed vaccine using this method. The vaccine had been tested in 50 dogs before its first human trial. This vaccine was used on 9-year-old Joseph Meister, on July 6, 1885, after the boy was badly mauled by a rabid dog. This was done at some personal risk for Pasteur, since {{he was not a}} licensed physician and could have faced prosecution for treating the boy. After consulting with physicians, he decided {{to go ahead with the}} treatment. Over 11 days, Meister received 13 inoculations, each inoculation using viruses that had been weakened for a shorter period of time. Three months later he examined Meister and found that he was in good health. Pasteur was hailed as a hero and the <b>legal</b> <b>matter</b> was not pursued. Analysis of his laboratory notebooks shows that Pasteur had treated two people before his vaccination of Meister. One survived but may not actually have had rabies, and the other died of rabies. Pasteur began treatment of Jean-Baptiste Jupille on October 20, 1885, and the treatment was successful. Later in 1885, people, including four children from the United States, went to Pasteur's laboratory to be inoculated. In 1886, he treated 350 people, of which only one developed rabies. The treatment's success laid the foundations for the manufacture of many other vaccines. The first of the Pasteur Institutes was also built on the basis of this achievement.|$|E

500|$|Though {{most of the}} {{developers}} involved in the game were shielded {{from the effects of}} the lawsuit, Double Fine's Caroline Esmurdoc noted that it took a significant toll on Schafer and the other lead executives at the company. Activision's lawsuit had been filed at the time the game had reached the alpha release state, and would need to be concluded prior to the game's final release; this required the executives to dedicate their time towards information gathering, interviewing, and other legal matters [...] "during the crunchiest, most critical time of development". As such, while they ultimately were able to settle the <b>legal</b> <b>matter,</b> Esmurdoc believed that the impact of the effort in settling the lawsuit impacted the quality of the final product. Schafer wrote more than 50% of the game's dialog in the few months following the completion of the lawsuit and prior to release, a [...] "big crunch" [...] for him.|$|E
