500|$|During the mid-song {{instrumental}} passage, {{the melody}} {{line of the}} sitar incorporates aspects of the alap, raising the melody previewed there by an octave. The song then returns to verses sung over the A and B sections, culminating in the line [...] "I'll make <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{if you want me}} to." [...] The arrival of the drut gat follows Hindustani convention by ending the composition at an accelerated tempo, although the brevity of this segment marks a departure from the same tradition.|$|E
500|$|Having {{crossed into}} France, they sought {{friendly}} troops. They decided {{to bypass the}} German positions by crossing the Maritime Alps, with a local guide, {{over the course of}} two days. They lacked equipment and clothing for mountaineering. During the night, Smith took off his shoes, and found in the morning that they had frozen and that he could not put them on. He continued in his socks, which wore through, forcing him to finish the journey walking barefoot on the ice and snow. After 23 days since Smith and Bill set off from Piancastagna, they met American troops who took them to a local base camp, from where they were returned to their respective forces. The Americans took Smith to Marseille, from where he was flown to the RAF transit camp at Naples. On arriving in late November 1944, Smith sent a brief telegram home to Selukwe: [...] "Alive and well. <b>Love</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> all—Ian." ...|$|E
500|$|Ross and O'Reilly {{soon came}} to the usual {{division}} of labor between the director and assistant: the director would handle public affairs and make policy decisions as needed, while the assistant dealt with the day-to-day business of the bureau. Ross undertook a heavy travel schedule, visiting Mint facilities, making speeches backing Roosevelt, and campaigning for Democratic candidates in Wyoming. [...] This left O'Reilly running the Washington office as acting director. The two women carried on a businesslike but warm correspondence during these times, with O'Reilly writing to Ross (who had embarked {{on a tour of}} the mints) [...] "I am so anxious to have your mind at ease about the office here [...] that I have resorted to rather frequent telegrams. [...] They are so much more direct and up to date than letters... my <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and every good wish for the success of your visits to our beloved mint institutions." [...] Scheer suggests that O'Reilly would have found Ross's reports from the field valuable; they showed how the Mint recovered from the initial years of the Depression, when relatively few coins were produced, to the mid-1930s, when strong demand for coinage led the bureau to run the mints with two or even three shifts.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1980s Richards {{has made}} more {{frequent}} guest appearances. In 1981 he played on reggae singer Max Romeo's album Holding Out My <b>Love</b> <b>to</b> <b>You.</b> He {{has worked with}} Tom Waits on three occasions, adding guitar and backing vocals to Waits' album Rain Dogs (1985); co-writing, playing and sharing the lead vocal on [...] "That Feel" [...] on Bone Machine (1992); and adding guitar and vocals to Bad As Me (2011). In 1986 Richards produced and played on Aretha Franklin's rendition of [...] "Jumpin' Jack Flash" [...] and served as musical producer and band leader (or, as he phrased it, [...] "S director") for the Chuck Berry film Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll.|$|E
2500|$|The first verse {{begins with}} Lopez singing, [...] "Nobody knows what I'm feeling inside. I find it so stupid {{so why should}} I hide that I love to make <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> baby." [...] The quick pace electro beat returns, revving up energy before Lopez goes into the chorus, [...] "I wanna dance and love and dance again." [...] Sara Gates of The Huffington Post said that the chorus line [...] "will surely get stuck in your head." [...] It has been {{suggested}} that the chorus was [...] "cheesy" [...] and weak, and ends up being [...] trumped by the pre-chorus, verses, overall production and fist-pumping beat. The song contains sexual innuendos, and Lopez sings the bridge with heartbreaking emotion. The song has been compared to Lopez's song [...] "Waiting For Tonight". Kyle Anderson from Entertainment Weekly noted that Pitbull's lyrics [...] "Can't even show love 'cause they'll sue ya" [...] was a reference to Lindsay Lohan suing him for using a reference to her without her consent in his song [...] "Give Me Everything" [...] (2011).|$|E
2500|$|The album's final {{track is}} lead single [...] "Just a Little While", which opens with funk guitars and {{transitions}} into uptempo pop-rock. Jackson blends carnal and [...] "dirty" [...] intentions with innocent desires, and longs to be intimate with her partner again: [...] "Can't {{stop thinking about}} the things we do/And how it feels making <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> [...] You know I'll take it anywhere/That you wanna go right now/Just love me for a little while." [...] The song {{has been described as}} [...] "push-button rock & roll" [...] and the album's [...] "most interesting, and energetic moment", although its placement as the last track was considered [...] "odd." [...] In international bonus [...] "Put Your Hands On", Jackson sings of aligning with her lover's energy over a midtempo house beat. In [...] "I'm Here", Jackson convinces a companion she'll never abandon them and stops them from expressing negative thoughts: [...] " [...] I don't wanna hear you say/Your wall stands tall of stone/Because love harassed you with pain/You feel you'll grow old alone [...] Someone wanting to love you deeply/Won't you let me?" ...|$|E
