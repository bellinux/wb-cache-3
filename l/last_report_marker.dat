40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need for {{biomarkers}} to help predict prognosis and guide management of esophageal cancer. This review identifies, evaluates and meta-analyses the evidence for reported somatic and germline DNA sequence biomarkers of outcome and stage. A systematic review was carried out of the PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases (20 August 2014), {{in conjunction with the}} ASCO Level of Evidence scale for biomarker research. Meta-analyses were carried out for all <b>reported</b> <b>markers</b> associated with outcome measures by more than one study. Four thousand and four articles were identified, 762 retrieved and 182 studies included. There were 65 <b>reported</b> <b>markers</b> of survival or recurrence 12 (18. 5 %) were excluded due to multiple comparisons. Following meta-analysis, significant associations were seen for six tumor variants (mutant TP 53 and PIK 3 CA, copy number gain of ERBB 2 /HER 2, CCND 1 and FGF 3, and chromosomal instability/ploidy) and seven germline polymorphisms: ERCC 1 rs 3212986, ERCC 2 rs 1799793, TP 53 rs 1042522, MDM 2 rs 2279744, TYMS rs 34743033, ABCB 1 rs 1045642 and MTHFR rs 1801133. Twelve germline markers of treatment complications were reported; 10 were excluded. Two tumor and 15 germline markers (11 excluded) of chemo (radio) therapy response were reported. Following meta-analysis, associations were demonstrated for mutant TP 53, ERCC 1 rs 11615 and XRCC 1 rs 25487. There were 41 tumor/germline <b>reported</b> <b>markers</b> of stage; 27 (65. 9 %) were excluded. Numerous DNA markers of outcome and stage have been reported, yet few are backed by high-quality evidence. Despite this, a small number of variants appear reliable. These merit evaluation in prospective trials, within the context of high-throughput sequencing and gene expression...|$|R
