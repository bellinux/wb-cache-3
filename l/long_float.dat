60|$|Our friend John, {{during these}} days {{preceding}} the party, the party itself, and the clearing up after it, enacted submissively {{that part of}} unconditional surrender which {{the master of the}} house, if well trained, generally acts on such occasions. He resembled the prize ox, which is led forth adorned with garlands, ribbons, and docility, to grace a triumphal procession. He went where he was told, did as he was bid, marched to the right, marched to the left, put on gloves and cravat, and took them off, entirely submissive to the word of his little general; and exhibited, in short, an edifying spectacle of that pleasant domestic animal, a tame husband. He had to make atonement for being a reformer, and for endeavoring to live like a Christian, by conceding to his wife all this latitude of indulgence; and he meant to go through it like a man and a philosopher. To be sure, in his eyes, it was all so much unutterable bosh and nonsense; and bosh and nonsense for which he was eventually to settle the bills: but he armed himself with the patient reflection that all things have their end in time,--that fireworks and Chinese lanterns, bands of music and kid gloves, ruffs and puffs, and pinkings and quillings, and all sorts of unspeakable eatables with French names, would ere <b>long</b> <b>float</b> down the stream of time, and leave their record only in a few bad colds and days of indigestion, which also time would mercifully cure.|$|E

50|$|The Lakes Water Bird {{was built}} in 1911 for E.W. Wakefield, of the Lakes Flying Company, Windermere by A.V. Roe, who would build {{aircraft}} to the designs of individual customers. It was built as a landplane {{with the intention of}} converting it to a seaplane once testing was complete. Wakefield had been interested in waterborne aircraft since 1909 and had performed experiments with different float designs towed at speed across Lake Windermere. Unsticking problems persisted until he visited Henri Fabre in France and got useful advice on float design.

Just past the Y, Little River exits the Great Smoky Mountains National Park into Tuckaleechee Cove and Townsend. From this point forward, with the exception of two old mill dams, the Little River can be navigated in a kayak at normal water levels. Tubers typically travel from the Townsend Y to the vicinity of the first mill dam (above the Highway 321 bridge).

40|$|December 13 - 14, 2006 Siam City Hotel, Bangkok, ThailandSea turtle bycatch {{issues are}} of special concern in tuna {{longline}} fisheries. To avoid sea turtle bycatch, {{we developed a}} mid-water float system, which is a method of setting the longline hooks at almost the same depth. When enough <b>long</b> <b>float</b> line was deployed with the mid-water float system (the mid-F system), all hooks could be set in water deeper than where sea turtle predominantly forage and in the depth of tuna habitat. Sea trials of full scale longline gear with mid-water float and <b>long</b> <b>float</b> line (long FL) were {{carried out in the}} Indian Ocean in December 2005. One mid-water float (buoyancy of 2200 gf or 2560 gf) was attached to the center of one-basket mainline, both ends of which were hung with two <b>long</b> <b>float</b> lines (100 m). The conventional longline setting (the length of float lines were 40 m) without any mid-water float was also conducted as a control. The mainline with <b>long</b> <b>float</b> lines were set at a depth from 125 m to 175 m. The depth range of hooks with mid-F system was at most 50 m, while that of the conventional longline setting was over 125. 5 m. The mid-F & long FL system allowed all hooks to be set at sufficient depth for capture of tuna, with an associated avoidance of sea turtle bycatch as well as more effective tuna catch...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study shows}} {{the effect of}} fabric {{tightness}} and fabric material on the mechanical properties of fabric–cement composites. Six fabric designs from the same fabric material were used. These fabric designs are vary in the specific tightness. Also, three fabric materials with the same fabric design were used in this work. Different sets of specimens were made, after that these specimens were tested on tensile and bending testing machines. It {{was found that the}} mechanical properties of the composite materials were influenced by the length of the warp thread float, i. e. the longer is the yarns float in the fabric, the greater is the tensile strength properties of the reinforced fabric, its construction and the material of the reinforced fabric. Therefore, it is recommended to use fabric with yarns with higher tenacity {{in the direction of the}} application of load and with either <b>long</b> <b>float</b> or minimum number of intersections...|$|E

The precise semantics of these functions is not considered any further in this specification of the Java Virtual Machine semantics. The following total semantic functions are used for truncating values of type Int to `smaller' Java types: i 2 z; i 2 b; i 2 c; i 2 s : Int !

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} and data analysis of the PERDaix detector (Proton Electron Radiation Detector Aix-la-Chapelle). PERDaix is a particle detector with an geometrical acceptance of 33 cm 2 sr designed to measure the charged cosmic-ray flux {{with the help of}} three subdetectors: a spectrometer consisting of a permanentmagnet and eight tracker layers, a time-of-flight detector (TOF), and a transition radiation detector (TRD). The detector was flown on board a stratospheric research balloon in November 2010. It recorded about 170 000 events during the 1. 5 hour <b>long</b> <b>float</b> phase at an altitude of 33 km. These data allow the measurement of the primarycosmic-ray flux of protons and helium nuclei. PERDaix uses novel detector technologies for a precise measurement of charged particles. These technologies are based on the light emitted when a charged particle crosses a so-called scintillation material. This scintillation light is detected with SiPMs – highly sensitive semiconductor photo detectors developed during the last few years. They achieve a detection efficiency of up to 50 % and an internal gain of the order of 106. These properties allow the detection of single photons without the need for a sophisticated low-noise amplification circuit. Several SiPMs can be produced next to each other on a silicon substrate to form a linear array. The possibility of a fine segmentation (250 μm) make them suitable for high resolution tracking detectors. The scintillation light is produced in a ribbon of five layers of 250 μm thin fibers. This thesis shows that the production process yields tracker modules with a very homogeneous response and a single point resolution of 50 μm. SiPMs are also used in the TOF to read out 5 cm wide scintillator bars. The TOF provides the main trigger for the other subdetectors, the differentiation of up- fromdownward flying particles, the information for the particle identification via the signal heights, and an improvement of momentum resolution at low energies. The development, test measurements, and performance of the TOF are presented. The TOF reaches a time difference resolution of 420 ps with an efficiency close to one. The thesis shows the design concepts, the special challenges of the operation on board a stratospheric research balloon, and data analysis concepts which finally end in measured cosmic-ray fluxes of protons and helium nuclei. These are used to determine the solar modulation parameter in November 2010...|$|E
40|$|Android {{development}} is hot, and many programmers {{are interested in}} joining the fun. However, because this technology is based on Java, you should first obtain a solid grasp of the Java language and its foundational APIs to improve your chances of succeeding as an Android app developer. After all, you will be busy learning the architecture of an Android app, the various Android-specific APIs, and Android-specific tools. If you do not already know Java fundamentals, you will probably {{end up with a}} massive headache from also having to quickly cram those fundamentals into your knowledge base.   Learn Java for Android Development, Second Edition teaches programmers of any skill level the essential Java language and foundational Java API skills that must be learned to improve the programmer’s chances of succeeding as an Android app developer. Each of the book’s 14 chapters provides an exercise section that gives you the opportunity to reinforce your understanding of the chapter’s material. Answers to the book’s more than 500 exercises are provided in an appendix. A second appendix provides a significant game-oriented Java application, which you can convert into an Android app. Once you complete this book, you should be ready to dive into beginning Android app development.   Maybe, start that journey with Apress' Beginning Android.   What you’ll learn The Java language:  This book provides complete coverage of nearly every pre-Java version 7 language feature (native methods are briefly mentioned but not formally covered). Starting with basic language features (e. g., comments, types, expressions, and statements), you progress to those features related to classes and objects, followed by object-oriented features related to inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces. You then explore the advanced language features for nested types, packages, static imports, exceptions, assertions, annotations, generics, and enums. Continuing, you investigate strictfp, synchronized, volatile, the enhanced for loop statement, autoboxing/unboxing, and transient fields. Java APIs:  In addition to Object and APIs related to exceptions, you explore Math, StrictMath, BigDecimal, BigInteger, String, StringBuffer/StringBuilder, Boolean, Character, Byte, Short, Integer, <b>Long,</b> <b>Float,</b> Double, Number, the Threads API, System, Runtime, Process, the Collections Framework, the Concurrency Utilities, Date, Formatter, Random, Scanner, the ZIP and JAR APIs, File, RandomAccessFile, stream classes, and writer/reader classes, InetAddress, SocketOptions, Socket, ServerSocket, DatagramSocket, MulticastSocket, URL, URLConnection, URLEncoder, URLDecoder, NetWorkInterface, InterfaceAddress, CookieHandler, CookieManager, CookieStore, CookiePolicy, Buffer, ByteBuffer, CharBuffer, DoubleBuffer,FloatBuffer, IntBuffer, LongBuffer, ShortBuffer, MappedByteBuffer, Channel, WritableByteChannel, ReadableByteChannel,ScatteringByteChannel, GatheringByteChannel, FileChannel, the Regular Expressions API, JDBC, and more. Applying these:  You will learn how to use the JDK’s javac (compiler), java (application launcher), javadoc (Java documentation generator), and jar (Java archive creator, updater, and extractor) tools. You will also receive an introduction to the Eclipse integrated development environment, which is the official standard for developing Android apps. Who this book is for This book is for any programmer - including existing Java programmers and Objective-C-based iPhone and iPad programmers - of any skill level who needs to obtain a solid understanding of the Java language and foundational Java APIs before jumping into Android app development.

The dynamic behaviour of very <b>long</b> <b>floating</b> bridges with novel designs are prone to uncertainties. Studying the dynamic behaviour of existing bridges is valuable for understanding the in-situ performance. We present a case study of the Bergsøysund Bridge, a 840 m <b>long</b> <b>floating</b> pontoon bridge located in Norway. An extensive monitoring system is installed on the bridge, including a network of accelerometers. A finite element model of the bridge is established. Using the measured acceleration output and recently developed Kalman filter based methods (a joint input-state (JIS) estimation algorithm and a dual Kalman filter (DKF)), we estimate accelerations at unmeasured locations. It is shown that the estimated response from the DKF agrees well with direct reference measurements. For the JIS, numerical instabilities in the estimates occur due to ill-conditioning of the matrices used in the system inversion. </p...|$|R
