2500|$|Swamiji {{elaborated}} on {{the reasons}} for the near total elimination of the Buddhist religion (Mahayana Buddhism) from India. He said that [...] "At the present day there is not one who calls oneself a Buddhist in India, the land of its birth." [...] This was because Buddha's philosophy clashed with the [...] "eternal rocks of the Vedas" [...] to which people, Brahmin's in particular, were wedded {{and did not want to}} accept change. Thus Buddhism could not survive in India. When Buddha was asked by his Brahmin disciples to translate his works, which were in the local language of the people, to Sanskrit, his reply was [...] "I am for the poor, for the people; <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>speak</b> in the tongue of the people." [...] Swamiji also mentioned in his speech the loss to India was the [...] "reforming zeal, that wonderful sympathy and charity for everybody, that wonderful leaven which Buddhism had brought to the masses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Channel 8 {{became known}} for its heavy {{schedule}} of local programs {{during the period from}} the 1950s through the 1980s. The most popular was a show aimed at younger audiences; Jerry Haynes hosted a local children's program on the station on-and-off from 1961 to 1996. Originally debuting in March 1961 as Mr. Peppermint, Haynes (who donned a red- and white-striped jacket and straw hat in his portrayal of the titular character, accompanied by a candy-striped cane) starred alongside a variety of puppet characters (performed by Vern Dailey) and presented various segments from educational content to cartoon shorts; five years after ending its original nine-year run on WFAA in 1970, the program was revived as the half-hour magazine-style educational series Peppermint Place in 1975, running for 21 additional years—expanding into syndication for its final seven—until the program ended its collective 30-year run in July 1996. Other notable WFAA local productions included the music series The Group And Chapman and its progenitor Sump'n Else (both of which were hosted by Ralph Baker Jr. and Ron Chapman), Dallas Bandstand (also hosted by Haynes), lifestyle and fashion talk program The Julie Bennell Show (hosted by Dallas Morning News food editor Julie Bunnell), the viewer Q series <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Speak</b> to the Manager (originally titled Ask the Manager and later named Inside Television for the final four years of its run, co-hosted by Belo vice president Myron [...] "Mike" [...] Shapiro), and local versions of the Dialing for Dollars and PM Magazine franchises. Channel 8 also served as the original Dallas-Fort Worth home of the magazine series Texas Country Reporter, after host Bob Phillips, who originated it on KDFW in September 1972 as the locally produced 4 Country Reporter, sold the series into regional syndication (airing on WFAA under the title 8 Country Reporter) in 1986.|$|E

But there was always {{something}} to be done in a hurry--something to be worked out--something to be seen, as I thought, only in my own quiet way. I believe if I had but had the sense to take my old friend with me, he would have shown me ever so much more than I found out by myself. But it was not to be; and year after year I went to grumble and mope at Venice, or Lago Maggiore; and Mr. Harrison to enjoy himself from morning to night at Broadstairs or Box Hill. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> not <b>speak</b> with disdain of either.

But why talk I what is true and just to thee, who hast been a man of violence from thy youth upwards? <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> rather <b>speak</b> to thee such language as thou canst comprehend. Deliver these young men up to me,' he said, when he had led Redgauntlet a little apart from the crowd, 'and I will not only free thee from the heavy charge of damages which thou hast incurred by thine outrage upon my property, but I will add ransom for them and for myself. What would it profit thee to do the youths wrong, by detaining them in captivity?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "MY DEAR BOB--How {{many good}} excuses (and you know I was ever good at an excuse) might I call up to vindicate my past shameful silence. I might tell how I wrote a long letter {{on my first}} coming hither, and seem vastly angry at my not {{receiving}} an answer; I might allege that business (with business you know I was always pestered) had never given me time to finger a pen. But I suppress those and twenty more as plausible, and as easily invented, since they might be attended with a slight inconvenience of being known to be lies. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> then <b>speak</b> truth. An hereditary indolence (I have it from the mother's side) has hitherto prevented my writing to you, and still prevents my writing at least twenty-five letters more, due to my friends in Ireland. No turn-spit-dog gets up into his wheel with more reluctance than I sit down to write; yet no dog ever loved the roast meat he turns better than I do him I now address.|$|R

He never told me what it was for, but once he <b>let</b> <b>me</b> hear it <b>speak.</b> It went on just like this one--tik, tik, tik--but it did not require shaking or squeezing. I think it had a tongue like some of our squaws, who never stop speaking. One day when I went into the trader's house I saw it lying on the thing with four legs which the white men put their food on when they want to eat, and it was talking away to itself as fast as ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> first <b>speak</b> of Millicent, the elder.

In Cornwall it is always so. Tall for her years, straight and slim, with no red colour on her cheeks; she had brown hair and large serious grey eyes; those eyes and her general air of gravity, and her forehead, which was too broad for perfect beauty, made me a little shy of her and we were not too intimate. And, indeed, that feeling on my part, which made me a little careful and ceremonious in our intercourse, seemed to be only what she expected of me. One day in a forgetful or expansive moment I happened to call her [...] "Millie," [...] which caused her to look to me in surprise. [...] "Don't you like me to call you Millie--for short?" [...] I questioned apologetically. [...] "No," [...] she returned gravely; [...] "it is not my name--my name is Millicent." [...] And so it had to be to the end of the chapter.|$|R
