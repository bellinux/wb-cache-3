30|$|In this paper, {{a device}} level {{approach}} {{was conducted to}} achieve linear output frequency tuning in an LC resonant system.

Integration of the proposed MEMS capacitor with the VCO circuits could require an extra fabrication cost.

40|$|Several {{fabrication}} {{techniques for}} surface micromachined 3 -D structures {{have been developed}} for RF components. The fabrication techniques all have in common the use of epoxy patterning and subsequent metallization. Techniques and structures such as embedded conductors, epoxy-core conductors, a reverse-side exposure technique, a multi-exposure scheme, and inclined patterning are presented. The epoxy-core conductor technique makes it easy to fabricate high-aspect-ratio (10 - 20 : 1), tall (~ 1 mm) RF subelements as well as potentially very complex structures by taking advantage of advanced epoxy processes. To demonstrate feasibility and usefulness of the developed fabrication techniques for RF applications, two test vehicles are employed. One is a solenoid type RF inductor, and the other is a millimeter wave radiating structure such as a W-band quarter-wavelength monopole antenna. The embedded inductor approach provides mechanical robustness and package compatibility as well as good electrical performance. An inductor with a peak Q-factor of 21 and an inductance of 2. 6 nH at 4. 5 GHz has been fabricated on a silicon substrate. In addition, successful integration with a CMOS power amplifier has been demonstrated. A high-aspect-ratio inductor fabricated using epoxy core conductors shows a maximum Q-factor of 84 and an inductance of 1. 17 nH at 2. 6 GHz on a glass substrate with a height of 900 um and a single turn. Successful W-band monopole antenna fabrication is demonstrated. A monopole with a height of 800 um shows its radiating resonance at 85 GHz with a return loss of 16 dB. In addition to the epoxy-based devices, an advanced tunable ferroelectric device architecture is introduced. This architecture enables a low-loss conductor device; a reduced intermodulation distortion (IMD) device; and a compact tunable <b>LC</b> <b>module.</b> A single-finger capacitor having a low-loss conductor with an electrode gap of 1. 2 um and an electrode thickness of 2. 2 um has been fabricated using a reverse-side exposure technique, showing a tunability of 33 % at 10 V. It shows an improved Q-factor of 21. 5. Reduced IMD capacitors consist of wide RF gaps and narrowly spaced high resistivity electrodes with a gap of 2 um and a width of 2 um within the wide gap. A 14 um gap and a 20 um gap capacitor show improved IMD performance compared to a 4 um gap capacitor by 6 dB and 15 dB, respectively, while the tunability is approximately 21 % at 30 V for all three devices due to the narrowly spaced multi-pair high resistivity DC electrodes within the gap. Finally, a compact tunable <b>LC</b> <b>module</b> is implemented by forming the narrow gap capacitor in an inductor shape. The resonance frequency of this device is variable as a function of DC bias and a frequency tunability of 1. 1 %/V is achieved. The RF components developed in this thesis illustrate the usefulness of the application of micromachining technology to this application area, especially as frequencies of operation of RF systems continue to increase (and therefore wavelengths continue to shrink).

A spinal projection from the locus coeruleus (LC) is thought to regulate nociceptive processing. To characterize and selectively manipulate the pontospinal noradrenergic neurons in rats, we implemented a retrograde targeting strategy using a canine adenoviral vector to express channelrhodopsin 2 (CAV 2 -PRS-ChR 2 -mCherry). LC microinjection of CAV 2 -PRS-ChR 2 -mCherry produced selective, stable, transduction of noradrenergic neurons allowing reliable opto-activation in vitro. The ChR 2 -transduced LC neurons were opto-identifiable in vivo and functional control was demonstrated for > 6 months by evoked sleep-wake transitions. Spinal injection of CAV 2 -PRS-ChR 2 -mCherry retrogradely transduced pontine noradrenergic neurons, predominantly in the LC but also in A 5 and A 7. A pontospinal <b>LC</b> (ps:LC) <b>module</b> was identifiable, with somata located more ventrally within the nucleus and with a discrete subset of projection targets. These ps:LC neurons had distinct electrophysiological properties with shorter action potentials and smaller afterhyperpolarizations compared to neurons located in the core of the LC.

The filtering improvement due to the introduction of <b>LC</b> tuned amplifier <b>modules</b> (LCTAM) as the transversal element on the conven­tional lumped and transversal structure is illustrated by comparing the performances of a single LCTAM and double LCTAM filters with a conventional one. In order to demonstrate the novel filter usefulness three filters with two transversal sections were implemented with the same typical 0. 5 um GaAs MMIC technology (a conventional, a single and a double LCTAM). It is shown that when we increase the number of LCTAM the rejection increases, however the chip area and complexity also increase. For a 1. 54 GHz centre fre­quency filter, a good compromise is the double LCTAM.

Results An integrated data pipeline (Solvent Explorer/TOF 2 H) has been developed for the processing of LC-MALDI-derived HDX data. Based on an experiment-wide template, and taking an ab initio approach to chromatographic and spectral peak finding, initial data processing is based on accurate mass-matching to fully deisotoped peaklists accommodating, in MS/MS-confirmed peptide library searches, ambiguous mass-hits to non-target proteins. Isotope-shift re-interrogation of library search results allows quick assessment {{of the extent of}} deuteration from peaklist data alone. During raw spectrum editing, each spectral segment is validated in real time, consistent with the manageable spectral numbers resulting from LC-MALDI experiments. A semi-automated spectral-segment editor includes a semi-automated or automated assessment of the quality of all spectral segments as they are pooled across an XIC peak for summing, centroid mass determination, building of rates plots on-the-fly, and automated back exchange correction. The resulting deuterium uptake rates plots from various experiments can be averaged, subtracted, re-scaled, error-barred, and/or scatter-plotted from individual spectral segment centroids, compared to solvent exposure and hydrogen bonding predictions and receive a color suggestion for 3 D visualization.

Methods:QoL was assessed at baseline and every 3 weeks during first-line, using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 and QLQ–lung cancer specific <b>module</b> (<b>LC</b> 13). Mean changes from baseline within arms were reported. QoL response and time-to-deterioration of QoL using a competing-risk approach were compared between treatment arms. Results:Six hundred and thirty patients (83 %) completed baseline questionnaires. Compliance was affected by differential treatment efficacy, but was similar between arms for patients without progression or death. Significant differences in QoL responses were observed favoring chemotherapy for pain, sleeping, dyspnea, diarrhea, and favoring erlotinib for vomiting, constipation, sore mouth, and alopecia. In the small subset of patients with EGFR-mutated tumors, all selected items (global QoL, physical functioning, cough, dyspnea and pain) improved, whereas worsening or no change was observed in wild-type patients. Improvement was particularly evident in the first-line erlotinib arm as for global QoL and physical functioning. Conclusions:QoL was impacted by differential toxicity and efficacy between arms.

This device is particularly well suited for wireless handsets, mobile <b>LCD</b> <b>modules</b> and PDAs because of its small package format and easy−to−use pin assignments. In particular, the CM 1693 is ideal for EMI filtering and protecting data and control lines for the LCD display and camera interface in mobile handsets. The CM 1693 is housed in space saving, low profile, 0. 40 mm pitch uDFN packages in a RoHS compliant, lead−free format...|$|E
40|$|System {{integration}} of LC-displays and drivers with minimized space requirements is {{the aim of}} the joined project 'Mikroverbindungstechniken fuer LCD-Zellen'. Eight partners - four companies and four institutes - found together for joined research. Isotropic adhesive bonding, anisotropic adhesive bonding, PETAC conversion and new laser-transfer-modification-process for edge interconnection and as metallization for wire bonding are tailored for use in small and medium sized companies. The complex process steps must be available as a service provided by institutes and companies. The different above mentioned technologies are checked to be suitable for interconnecting LCDs and for system integration. The possibility of repairing the system is an important economic aspect. Fine pitch of conductors and short lap of LCDs and flexible printed circuit boards, high bonding strength, low electrical resistance, temperature stress stability are important qualities concerning LCD-micro-joining-techniques. Two experimental information boards with minimized dimensions were realized. The quality of micro-joints in <b>LCD</b> <b>modules</b> is checked by measurement of impedance for different frequencies. A careful evaluation of measurements cannot substitute temperature treatment but reduces expense and costs. Quality tests were carried out with special samples. Numerous experiments showed that small and medium sized companies can master the different techniques. LCD-micro-joining-techniques can be enhanced significantly in those companies. Also the number of possible applications is enlarged by use of new joining techniques. (orig.)

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis investigates modes of {{failure of the}} IGBT power module and how these modes can be coerced from an open circuit failure mode (OCFM) to a stable short circuit failure mode (SCFM) by using different interconnect technologies and material systems. SCFM is of great importance {{for a number of}} applications where IGBT power modules are connected in series string e. g. high voltage modular multi-level converters (M 2 <b>LC)</b> where one <b>module</b> failing to an OCFM can shut down the whole converter. The failure modes of IGBT samples based on wirebond, flexible PCB, sandwich and press pack structured interconnect technologies have been investigated. Destructive Type-II failure test were performed which concluded that the SCFM is dependent on the energy level dissipating in the power module and the interconnect technology. The higher thermal mass and stronger mechanical constraint of the interconnect enables module to withstand higher energy dissipation. The cross-sections of the tested samples have been characterised with the scanning electron microscope and three dimensional X-ray computed tomography imaging. It was observed that the networked conductive phases within the solidification structure and the Sn- 3. 5 Ag filled in cracks of the residual Si IGBT are responsible for low resistance conduction paths. The best networked conductive phase with lowest electrical resistance and high stability was offered by Ag if used as an intermediate interconnect material on emitter side of an IGBT. To offer a stable SCFM, a module has to be custom designed for a particular application. Hence for the applications which demand a stable SCFM, the IGBT module design becomes an integrated part of the complete power electronics system design...|$|R
40|$|Quality of life {{assessment}} {{in patients with}} lung cancer Clinical implications Mercedes Nicklasson Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition/ Respiratory Medicine, Institute of Medicine Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg Gothenburg, Sweden ABSTRACT Introduction. Lung cancer is the leading cancer-related cause of death worldwide. In Sweden, nearly 3, 700 patients are diagnosed with lung cancer every year. The overall prognosis is poor with a 5 -year relative survival rate of 13 % for men and 19 % for women. Malignant pleural mesothelioma is rare, with an annual incidence of 110 patients, and seldom curable. Most patients with lung cancer or mesothelioma are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease and experience multiple symptoms that {{have a negative impact}} on their health related quality of life (HRQL). In addition to increased survival, the goals of cancer care include symptom control, psychosocial support and improved or maintained HRQL. In current clinical practice, physicians may underestimate the patients´ HRQL problems and it has therefore been suggested that the incorporation of self-administered HRQL assessments in clinical practice could increase the focus on patient well-being. Aims. To evaluate whether the prospective use of individual HRQL measures in oncology clinical practice would have any influence on patient-physician communication, clinical decision-making, HRQL and satisfaction with care. Methods and results. We used the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C 30) and lung cancer <b>module</b> (<b>LC</b> 13) for screening of HRQL issues during consultations. In Paper I, we investigated the psychometric properties and clinical relevance of the instrument in 112 patients with advanced-stage lung cancer or mesothelioma who were receiving palliative care, but not chemotherapy. The EORTC QLQ-C 30 and LC 13 proved to be valid, reliable and clinically relevant for evaluation of HRQL in the target population. The clinical validity of the instrument was demonstrated by the associations between specific questionnaire domains and tests commonly used in clinical practice, including lung function and a 6 -minute walk test. In addition, most of the QLQ-C 30 functioning scores were significantly associated with remaining survival time. In Papers II-IV, 171 patients were randomized to one of two groups. Patients in the experimental group (EG) answered the QLQ-C 30 and LC 13 questionnaire using a digital table interface at scheduled outpatient visits, after which a printed summary of the HRQL results was presented to the physician during the consultation. Patients in the control group (CG) completed a paper version of the same questionnaire, which was not presented to the physician but stored for later analysis. When indicated, patients in both groups received palliative chemotherapy and/or palliative radiotherapy. Consultations were audio-recorded for quantitative content analysis. Information about medical and psychosocial interventions was retrieved from clinical records. Issues pertaining to emotional function were more frequently discussed during consultations in the EG (p< 0. 05). Similarly, interventions to alleviate emotional and social concerns were more common in the EG than in the CG (p= 0. 013 and p= 0. 0036, respectively). In addition, perceived psychosocial problems and general symptoms were more likely to be captured during consultations when self-reported HRQL measures were available to the physician. HRQL scores over time were similar across the groups. Emotional function and dyspnoea improved in the whole patient population, with no significant differences between the EG and the CG. In general, patients rated their satisfaction with care as high. Negative predictors included poor health status (most consistently appetite loss), younger age, living alone and older age of the physician at the last visit during the study period. Conclusions. Access to HRQL measures increases the probability of psychosocial problems and general symptoms being captured during consultations, but does not influence patients´ HRQL or satisfaction with care.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceLight-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{have become}} a good {{alternative}} to traditional cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) for backlighting sources in liquid crystal displays (LCDs). LED backlighting provides a number of benefits over CCFLs, such as greater efficiency, better brightness, longer lifetime, higher dimming ratios, and lower drive circuitry voltage [1]. One application where a higher dimming ratio is desired is in aerospace cockpit <b>LCD</b> <b>modules,</b> which need to provide both high brightness for sunlight readability and also a high dimming ratio for very low brightness during nighttime operation. Two methods commonly used to dim LEDs are constant current reduction(CCR) and pulse width modulation(PWM) dimming. The downside to using CCR is the limited dimming ratio and nonlinearities in light output that occur from variations in luminous efficacy over the dimming range [2]. To obtain a high dimming ratio using PWM dimming, the LED current rise time must be sufficiently faster than the minimum PWM. This ensures {{that there will be}} no nonlinearities in the light output, which could result in visible flicker when operating at low-brightness settings. To provide higher system efficiency, a method for soft starting the LED regulator is presented. This method allows for reduced head room operation by ramping the LED current during turn-on, which results in a reduced voltage dip on the LED power supply. Finally, a method for head room adjustment that allows for adjustment of the LED supply voltage for variations in forward voltage over temperature and time is presented...|$|E
