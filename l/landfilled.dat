5|$|The four-lane iconic skyway {{carries the}} US1/9 {{concurrency}} for most its length. While the skyway generally runs east–west between Newark and Jersey City, US1 and US9 are generally north–south routes. The {{west end of}} the skyway begins as US1/9 roadway ascends and passes over Raymond Boulevard in Newark's Ironbound neighborhood. At Tonnele Circle, US1/9 exits to grade and follows Tonnele Avenue north towards the Lincoln Tunnel and George Washington Bridge and the skyway becomes the four-lane Route139 as it passes over it. While the road continues to the Holland Tunnel, the skyway soon comes to its eastern end at a cut in Bergen Hill, just west of JohnF. Kennedy Boulevard. In addition to crossing the Hackensack and the Passaic, the skyway also passes over the New Jersey Turnpike, with which it has no interchange. Under most of the skyway is other vehicular, rail, maritime, and industrial infrastructure built on <b>landfilled</b> wetlands of the New Jersey Meadowlands.|$|E

50|$|Waste {{diversion}} or <b>landfill</b> diversion is {{the process}} of diverting waste from <b>landfills.</b> The success of <b>landfill</b> diversion can be measured by comparison {{of the size of the}} <b>landfill</b> from one year to the next. If the <b>landfill</b> grows minimally or remains the same, then policies covering <b>landfill</b> diversion are successful. For example, currently in the United States there are 3000 <b>landfills.</b> A measure of the success of <b>landfill</b> diversion would be if that number remains the same or is reduced. In 2009, it was recorded that the national average of <b>landfill</b> diversion in the United States was 33.8%, while San Francisco had implemented the most effective policies and had recorded a <b>landfill</b> diversion rate of 77%. By diverting <b>landfills</b> we can preserve our natural resources.|$|R

50|$|Bioreactor <b>landfills</b> {{accelerate}} {{the process of}} decomposition.

40|$|Conventional'' waste <b>landfills</b> emit methane, {{a potent}} {{greenhouse}} gas, in quantities such that <b>landfill</b> methane {{is a major}} factor in global climate change. Controlled <b>landfilling</b> is a novel approach to manage <b>landfills</b> for rapid completion of total gas generation, maximizing gas capture and minimizing emissions of methane to the atmosphere. With controlled <b>landfilling,</b> methane generation is accelerated and brought to much earlier completion by improving conditions for biological processes (principally moisture levels) in the <b>landfill.</b> Gas recovery efficiency approaches 100 % through use of surface membrane cover over porous gas recovery layers operated at slight vacuum. A field demonstration project's results at the Yolo County Central <b>Landfill</b> near Davis, California are, to date, highly encouraging. Two major controlled <b>landfilling</b> benefits would be the reduction of <b>landfill</b> methane emissions to minuscule levels, and the recovery of greater amounts of <b>landfill</b> methane energy in much shorter times than with conventional <b>landfill</b> practice.

25|$|Gases are {{produced}} in <b>landfills</b> {{due to the}} anaerobic digestion by microbes. In a properly managed <b>landfill</b> this gas is collected and used.

40|$|The {{main problem}} of <b>landfill</b> {{management}} in Indonesia is {{the difficulty in}} getting a location for Final Processing Sites (FPS) due to limited land and high land prices. Besides, about 95 % of existing <b>landfills</b> are uncontrolled dumping sites, which could potentially lead to water, soil and air pollution. Based on data from the Ministry of Environment (2010), The Act of the Republic of Indonesia Number 18 Year 2008 Concerning Solid Waste Management, prohibits open dumping at final processing sites and in ratification, the Local Governments have to convert the open dump sites into controlled or sanitary <b>landfill.</b> The Research Institute for Human Settlements has been conducting multi-year researches related to the rehabilitation of dumpsites toward sustainable <b>landfill.</b> The research methods are literature reviews, experiments, laboratory analysis and field observations. A pilot model of dumpsite rehabilitation {{was carried out in}} 2010 at the Final Processing Site at Cikundul in Sukabumi City, consisting of (1) mining <b>landfill</b> (2) construction of <b>landfill</b> cells in a former mining area with a semi aerobic <b>landfill</b> and an anaerobic <b>landfill</b> and (3) <b>landfill</b> operations using decomposed material from <b>landfill</b> mining as a soil cover. The purpose of the study is to develop a sustainable approach for <b>landfill</b> management and rehabilitation through <b>landfill</b> mining and implementation of semi aerobic <b>landfill.</b> Findings in the construction of <b>landfill</b> mining indicate that (1) the construction of <b>landfill</b> mining is constrained by leachate that is trapped in a pile of waste, therefore, the leachate needs to be pumped to leachate treatment installations, (2) the volume of waste excavation is expanding due to the high plastic content of about 26 % in <b>landfills</b> (3) the potency of decomposed materials from <b>landfill</b> mining is 40 – 83 % for <b>landfill</b> operations or greening [...] The performance of <b>landfill</b> systems shows that leachate quality of semi aerobic <b>landfill</b> tends to be lower than that of anaerobic <b>landfill.</b> Gas composition at semi aerobic <b>landfill</b> in FPS Sukabumi shows about 6 – 10 % CH 4 and about 15 – 16 % O 2; for an aerobic <b>landfill,</b> the gas composition is about 47 – 57 % CH 4 and about 2 – 3 % O 2. In conclusion the concept mining <b>landfill</b> could be developed especially for big cities where it is difficult to find a new site for <b>landfill</b> or to get soil cover for <b>landfill</b> operation. In a sustainable approach, the excavated area can be turned into a new area for <b>landfill</b> cell so that the capacity of existing Final Processing Site can be expanded using the block <b>landfill</b> concept. The <b>landfill</b> should be divided into three blocks: compost block, composting block and active block. Usage of the three blocks are rotated with the intention of using solid waste on the compost block as soil material for the active block through <b>landfill</b> mining...|$|R
2500|$|If {{the waste}} was <b>landfilled,</b> 1 ton of MSW would produce {{approximately}} [...] methane via the anaerobic decomposition of the biodegradable {{part of the}} waste. Since the global warming potential of methane is 34 {{and the weight of}} 62 cubic meters of methane at 25 degrees Celsius is 40.7kg, this is equivalent to 1.38 ton of CO2, which is more than the 1 ton of CO2 which would have been produced by incineration. In some countries, large amounts of landfill gas are collected. Still the global warming potential of the landfill gas emitted to atmosphere is significant. In the US it was estimated that the global warming potential of the emitted landfill gas in 1999 was approximately 32% higher than the amount of CO2 that would have been emitted by incineration. Since this study, the global warming potential estimate for methane has been increased from 21 to 35, which alone would increase this estimate to almost the triple GWP effect compared to incineration of the same waste.|$|E
2500|$|The {{quality of}} recyclates is {{recognized}} as one of the principal challenges that needs to be addressed for the success of a long-term vision of a green economy and achieving zero waste. Recyclate quality is generally referring to how much of the raw material is made up of target material compared to the amount of non-target material and other non-recyclable material. Only target material is likely to be recycled, so a higher amount of non-target and non-recyclable material will reduce the quantity of recycling product. A high proportion of non-target and non-recyclable material can make it more difficult for re-processors to achieve [...] "high-quality" [...] recycling. If the recyclate is of poor quality, it is more likely to end up being down-cycled or, in more extreme cases, sent to other recovery options or <b>landfilled.</b> For example, to facilitate the re-manufacturing of clear glass products there are tight restrictions for colored glass going into the re-melt process.|$|E
