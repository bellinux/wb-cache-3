40|$|This work aims at {{discussing}} {{the possibilities of}} high resolution neutron tomography, in comparison to conventional cone beam X ray CT, {{based on the results}} on a set of polymeric foamed materials. The experiments have been carried out at the BER II V 7 CONRAD instrument and compared to the images obtained in a CT system based on a microfocus tube and a high resolution flat panel detector. This type of materials has not been previously examined with neutron imaging. The enhanced neutron attenuation relative to the X ray attenuation encouraged this investigation. Nevertheless the results point to a better spatial resolution of X rays in comparison with current neutron tomography resolution although pixel size was in the same order. Reasons behind these results point to a low signal to noise S N ratio in neutron tomography due to the rather low neutron flux and the beam collimating <b>L</b> <b>D</b> <b>ratio</b> causing a reduction in the spatial resolution. Nevertheless the contrast of polymeric materials in neutron imaging offers further possibilities for future developments in high resolution neutron tomograph...|$|E
40|$|Neutron {{collimator}} is {{the most}} important component in a neutron radiography facility set up, which defines the neutron beam characteristic at the object plane. The neutron radiography facility in Malaysia was built at one of the radial beam ports of TRIGA MARK II PUSPATI research reactor RTP. At present, the facility has low thermal neutron intensity at the sample position, which leads to long irradiation times; it gives many limitations for the industrial applications. The collimator used for this facility is based on step divergent collimator type. The aim of this research is to design the best geometry and to choose materials for thermal neutron collimator so as to obtain a uniform beam, high <b>L</b> <b>D</b> <b>ratio</b> and a maximum thermal neutron flux at the object plane. In order to achieve this aim new collimator geometry has been designed to improve the existing radiography facility by using Monte Carlo simulation codes of SIMRES and MCNPX. The new design results are compared with those of the existing facility. Our simulation result may be of help in the design of new collimator for neutron radiography facilit...|$|E

30|$|PLA is a {{thermoplastic}} polymer {{which has}} the potential to replace traditional polymers such as PET, PS, and PC for packaging to electronic and automotive applications (Majid et al. 2010). While PLA has similar mechanical properties to traditional polymers, the thermal properties are not attractive due to low T g of 60 °C. This problem can be overcome by changing the stereochemistry of the polymer and blending with other polymers and processing aids to improve the mechanical properties, e.g., varying the <b>ratio</b> of <b>l</b> and <b>d</b> isomer <b>ratio</b> strongly influences the crystallinity of the final polymer. However, much more work is required to improve the properties of PLA to suit various applications.|$|R

We investigated geographical phenotypic {{variations in the}} Kelp Gull Larus dominicanus Lichtenstein, 1823, by separately conducting analyses of biometrics and wing tip patterns in males and females. We attempted to investigate the separate taxonomic status of the recently described <b>L.</b> <b>d.</b> judithae and <b>L.</b> <b>d.</b> melisandae, define the geographical range of the Antarctic taxon <b>L.</b> <b>d.</b> austrinus, and look for variations among populations currently attributed to the nominate <b>L.</b> <b>d.</b> dominicanus in South America and New Zealand. Sex-separated analyses confirmed the discriminant structures and wing patterns of <b>L.</b> <b>d.</b> judithae (from Indian Ocean sub-Antarctic islands) and <b>L.</b> <b>d.</b> melisandae (from Madagascar). We failed to find differences among birds from Antarctica, South Georgia, and the Falklands Is., and suggest that the range of <b>L.</b> <b>d.</b> austrinus could extend from the Antarctic Peninsula to these sub-Antarctic islands.

Isolated fibres were obtained by an enzymatic dissociation procedure. Intracellular micro-electrode recordings from isolated fibres and from fibres in intact muscles showed that the dissociation procedure did not significantly alter resting membrane potentials, input resistances or membrane time constants (tau m). The 14 day embryonic fibres of a. <b>l.</b> <b>d.</b> and p. <b>l.</b> <b>d.</b> {{did not have a}} measurable resting conductance to Cl-. At hatching, about 70 % of the resting conductance in p. <b>l.</b> <b>d.</b> fibres was due to Cl-. Membrane electrical properties were estimated from the analysis of voltage responses to intracellular injection of rectangular pulses of current.

An experiment were {{established as a}} completely romdomized design in 4 treatments (1. control, 2. pruning 50 % of inside canopy, 3. pruning 50 % of inside canopy and 1. 75 m top-cutting and 4. 1. 75 m top-cutting) with 4 replications. Sixteen of 22 -year-old, uniformly sized mangosteen tress were used. Water use of the mangosteen trees was determined during 3 stages: 1) fruit setting, 2) fruit development and 3) fruit ripening. Results showed that significant differences in water use among treatments occurred {{during the period of}} fruit-setting and fruit development. During the fruit-setting period, the mangosteen trees in treatment 4 exhibited significantly higher water use (88. 96 <b>l</b> <b>d</b> - 1) compared to the ramaining treatments of control (64. 63 <b>l</b> <b>d</b> - 1), treatment 2 (60. 47 <b>l</b> <b>d</b> - 1), and treatment 3 (42. 24 <b>l</b> <b>d</b> - 1).

40|$|Consider the {{regression}} model y = beta 0 1 + Xbeta + epsilon. Recently, the Liu estimator, {{which is an}} alternative biased estimator beta <b>L</b> (<b>d)</b> = (X'X + I) - 1 (X'X + dI) beta OLS, where 0 <d< 1 is a parameter, has been proposed to overcome multicollinearity. The advantage of beta <b>L</b> (<b>d)</b> over the ridge estimator beta R (k) is that beta <b>L</b> (<b>d)</b> is a linear function of d. Therefore, {{it is easier to}} choose d than to choose k in the ridge estimator. However, beta <b>L</b> (<b>d)</b> is obtained by shrinking the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator using the matrix (X'X + I) - 1 (X'X + dI) so that the presence of outliers in the y direction may affect the beta <b>L</b> (<b>d)</b> estimator. To cope with this combined problem of multicollinearity and outliers, we propose an alternative class of Liu-type M-estimators (LM-estimators) obtained by shrinking an M-estimator beta M, instead of the OLS estimator using the matrix (X'X + I) - 1 (X'X + dI). ...|$|R

A fragment of Ld, denoted by <b>L</b> <b>d,</b> is {{proved to be}} expressively complete for timed automata (Alur and Dill), i. e., every timed regular language is definable by a L d-formula and every L d-formula defines a timed regular language.
