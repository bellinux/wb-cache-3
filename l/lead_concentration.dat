25|$|Increased arsenic, nitrate and {{fluoride}} contamination {{was detected}} {{in drinking water}} in various localities in Pakistan, according to an official government document. Generally, water pressure is low in Pakistani supply systems. Together with leaky pipes, this leads to infiltration of contaminated water. A survey of drinking water samples in Karachi in 2007/08 found that, of 216 ground and surface water samples collected, 86% had lead levels higher than the WHO maximum acceptable concentration of 10 parts per billion (ppb). The mean <b>lead</b> <b>concentration</b> was 146 ppb in untreated ground water and 77 ppb in treated tap water. In 2012, according to Rafiq Khanani, professor and pathology chairman at the Dow University of Health Sciences, water-borne Naegleria fowleri have killed at least 10 people in Karachi in three months. The infection does not occur by drinking water infested with the amoeba, but if water enters the nose. The amoeba then attack the brain and cause primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. Newspapers reported that drinking water was provided without any treatment or disinfection, which facilitated {{the spread of the}} amoeba. As a reaction to the findings, a citizen of Karachi submitted a court petition asking the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board to fulfill its duty to provide clean water.

Linear regression was used to identify predictors of the three lead biomarkers, evaluating the influence of age, job duration, sex, education level, alcohol and tobacco use, creatinine clearance rate, and body mass index.  RESULTS—DMSA chelatable <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> ranged from 4. 8  to 2102. 9  µg and were positively associated with age, current smoking, and creatinine clearance rate. On average, women had 64  µg less DMSA chelatable lead than men. When blood lead and its square were added to a model with age, sex, current smoking, body mass index, and creatinine clearance rate, blood lead accounted for the largest proportion of the variance and sex became of borderline significance. Tibial <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> ranged from − 7 to 338  µg/g bone mineral and were positively associated with age, job duration, and body mass index. Women had, on average, 9. 7  µg/g less tibial lead than men.

40|$|CONTEXT: Kinetic models could assist clinicians {{potentially}} {{in managing}} cases of lead poisoning. Several models exist that can simulate lead kinetics {{but none of}} them can predict the effect of chelation in lead poisoning. Our aim was to devise a model to predict the effect of succimer (dimercaptosuccinic acid; DMSA) chelation therapy on blood <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: We integrated a two-compartment kinetic succimer model into an existing PBPK lead model and produced a Chelation Lead Therapy (CLT) model. The accuracy of the model's predictions was assessed by simulating clinical observations in patients poisoned by lead and treated with succimer. The CLT model calculates blood <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> as the sum of the background exposure and the acute or chronic lead poisoning. The latter was due either to ingestion of traditional remedies or occupational exposure to lead-polluted ambient air. The exposure duration was known. The blood <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> predicted by the CLT model were compared to the measured blood <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations.</b> RESULTS: Pre-chelation blood <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> ranged between 99 and 150 [*]μg/dL. The model was able to simulate accurately the blood <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> during and after succimer treatment. The pattern of urine lead excretion was successfully predicted in some patients, while poorly predicted in others.

We measured lead con-centrations by anodic stripping voltammetry (in blood) and 109 Cd-induced K-shell x-ray fluorescence (in bone). We used multiple linear regression to identify pre-dictors of <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Results.

Neural tube defects (affected births and terminations) were identified from the Glasgow register of congenital anomalies for the period 1983 - 95 for each postcode district in the study population. Correlations were sought between <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> and pregnancy prevalence of neural tube defects/ 1000 live births in postcode districts.  RESULTS—No correlation was found between domestic water <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> > 10 µg/litre and pregnancy prevalence of neural tube defects within postcode districts. Areas of Glasgow previously with high domestic water <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> did not have a higher prevalence of neural tube defects.

Data from a {{prospective}} study conducted in Boston suggested that blood <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> at 2 years of age were more predictive of cognitive deficits in older children than were later blood <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> or blood <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> measured concurrently with IQ. Therefore, cross-sectional associations between blood lead and IQ in school-age children have been widely interpreted as the residual effects of higher blood <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> at an earlier age or the tendency of less intelligent children to ingest more leaded dust or paint chips, rather than as a causal relationship in older children. Here we analyze data from a clinical trial in which children were treated for elevated blood <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> (20 – 44 µg/dL) at about 2 years of age and followed until 7 years of age with serial IQ tests and measurements of blood lead.

The evolution of man into beings who are more environmentally aware and the proclamation of more environmentally related legislation, should integrate well with this development. These factors should ensure that companies and institutions implement better pollution control and management. In this study lead pollution caused by the handling and storing of lead concentrate for export purposes in Saldanha Bay, is investigated. The Small Bay area was identified as the area likely to be most polluted and this study concentrated on the pollution in this specific area. The lead pollution was measured for a certain period by monitoring <b>lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> in samples of biological material (black mussels), soil, sediment and dust. From the results the following conclusions are made. <b>Lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> in biological material in the Small Bay area remained constant with no real increase or decrease. <b>Lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the soil samples on the north easterly side of Small Bay showed a definite decrease during the monitoring period. <b>Lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the sediments of the Small Bay area indicate a decrease during the monitoring period. <b>Lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> in dust collected on the eastern side of Small Bay remained constant during the monitoring period. <b>Lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> in dust collected on the north eastern side showed a decrease. In general, based on the above results obtained, it can be concluded that lead pollution in the Small Bay area of Saldanha decreased during the monitoring period. <b>Lead</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the biological material and dust that did not show a decrease, remained constant i. e. did not worsen...|$|R
