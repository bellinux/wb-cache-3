50|$|The large-format camera, taking sheet film, is {{a direct}} {{successor}} of the early plate cameras and remained in use for high quality photography and for technical, architectural and industrial photography. There are three common types, the view camera with its monorail and field camera variants, and the press camera. They have an extensible bellows with the lens and shutter mounted on a <b>lens</b> <b>plate</b> at the front. Backs taking rollfilm, and later digital backs are available {{in addition to the}} standard dark slide back. These cameras have a wide range of movements allowing very close control of focus and perspective. Composition and focusing is done on view cameras by viewing a ground-glass screen which is replaced by the film to make the exposure; they are suitable for static subjects only, and are slow to use.|$|E
5000|$|The Reisekamera, {{meaning a}} [...] "travel camera", is a large-format wooden bellows tailboard view camera of almost {{standardised}} design, unlike the much lighter and more flexible field camera, {{but not as}} cumbersome as the studio camera. A sturdy tripod is always brought along, but it {{might just as well}} be placed on a tabletop. It has equally sized rectangular front and back panels on a full-width double-extension baseboard that is hinged near the front. The front panel, holding the <b>lens</b> <b>plate,</b> has horizontal and vertical movements, while the back is tilt-suspended on brass standards running on brass tracks {{on either side of the}} baseboard, providing rack and pinion focusing on the film plane. An almost non-tapering calico double-extension bellows is employed; allowing the projected image to freely reach the photographic plate regardless of lens offset position. The camera folds flat, after the back panel is brought forward to the lens panel, by folding the hinged base board up, and thus conveniently protecting the focusing screen. For insertion of the wooden dark slide plate cassette, the hinged focusing screen is swung up and away. The Reisekamera was made available for several plate sizes; most common are the 13×18 cm, 18×24 cm and 24×30 cm versions. Shutter and lens were normally not part of the original delivery. However, some were made available with a spectacular focal-plane shutter, recognisable by the brass mechanisms either side of the back panel.|$|E
50|$|The Reisekamera {{might be}} {{considered}} the portable version of the studio camera, to be used outside the professional photographic studio, on assignment at location, for architectural work or documentation away from the studio, in homes or museums. It is collapsible, yet not small, and it is much too cumbersome and large for the travelling amateur to bring along. The bellows extension would allow a selection of focal length lenses to be employed covering the required field of view. The back panel may be tilted and turned slightly, and at the front, the <b>lens</b> <b>plate</b> may slide vertically and horizontally to control perspective and distortion. The Reisekamera {{would be one of}} several cameras suitable for field assignments. A black cloth is required to keep stray light out while observing the image on the ground glass focusing screen. When the image is composed and focused, the focusing screen is replaced by the plate holder. The lens cap is placed on the lens, the dark slide removed from the plate holder, and the lens cap is removed for the required exposure time and replaced. If an auxiliary shutter is present, it may perform the function of the lens cap. After the exposure the dark slide is replaced to protect the exposed plate from stray light. The plate holder is either turned for a second photo, or brought to the darkroom for plate development and copying. The camera would be supplied with a number of plate holders, each usually holding two plates, one on either side.|$|E

40|$|We discuss {{residual}} lens {{effects in}} multi-view switchable auto-stereoscopic lenticular-based 2 D/ 3 D displays. With {{the introduction of}} a switchable lenticular, it is possible to switch between a 2 D mode and a 3 D mode. The 2 D mode displays conventional content, whereas the 3 D mode provides the sensation of depth to the viewer. The uniformity of a display in the 2 D mode is quantified by the quality parameter modulation depth. In order to reduce the modulation depth in the 2 D mode, birefringent lens plates are investigated analytically and numerically, by ray tracing. We can conclude that the modulation depth in the 2 D mode can be substantially decreased by using birefringent lens plates with a perfect index match between lens material and <b>lens</b> <b>plate.</b> Birefringent lens plates do not disturb the 3 D performance of a switchable 2 D/ 3 D display...|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{fabrication}} of vertical three-dimensional micro-Fresnel lenses with polysili-con materials by surface micromachining technique. Micro-Fresnel lenses {{play a very}} important role in micro-optics because of their thin film structures and their ability to achieve very short fo-cal lengths. Although micro-Fresnel lenses have been studied and well understood [11, the lens planes usually are restrained {{on the surface of the}} substrate. Therefore, their abilities of integra-tion with other optoelectronic components in micro-optics are limited. In this paper, we present a vertical three-dimensional binary-phase micro-Fresnel lens which overcomes the disadvantage of conventional micro-fresnel lenses and is able to rotate out of the plane and stands perpendicular to the substrate. This lens and other similarly constructed micro-optical elements can shrink the whole free-space optical system to a single micro-chip. They have applications in free-space opti-cal interconnect, packaging and optical storage. The fabrication of the vertical micro-Fresnel lens has been reported [2].

40|$|Fresnel lenses {{are often}} used as primary optical {{components}} in concentrating photovoltaics (CPV). When applied in the field, varying conditions during operation lead to variations in lens temperature which has a strong impact on the optical efficiency of the lenses. A setup for indoor characterization {{with the ability to}} heat <b>lens</b> <b>plates</b> allows for the assessment of the quality of Fresnel lenses by means of their irradiance profiles in the focal plane. To analyze the measured temperature dependency we simulate thermal deformations of the lens geometry with finite element method (FEM) tools and use the resulting lens geometry as an input to ray tracing simulations. A close match between computer simulations and measurements of the irradiance profile in the focal plane is achieved, validating our simulation approach. This allows us to judge and optimize the temperature dependence of new lens designs before building and testing prototypes. The simulation enables us to analyze and understand all superimposed effects in detail. The developed tools in combination with detailed solar resource data and knowledge of the CPV system will be the basis for future assessment of overall performance and further optimization of optics for CPV applications...|$|R
