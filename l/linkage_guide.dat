Five poses imply ten relative displacement poles, which yields four different opposite pole quadrilaterals each having its own circling point curve. Burmester shows that these curves will intersect in as many as four points, called the Burmester points, each of which will trace five points on a circle around a center point. Because two circling points define a four-bar linkage, these four points can yield as many as six four-bar <b>linkages</b> that <b>guide</b> the coupler link through the five specified task positions.|$|R

Clone sizes and overlaps derived from clone fingerprints are used for the calculation of length constraints between any two BAC neighbors sharing 40 % of their size. These constraints are used to promote the <b>linkage</b> and <b>guide</b> the arrangement of sequence contigs within a sequence scaffold at the layout phase of WGS assemblies.

40|$|Accelerated {{contamination}} of habitats with debris has caused increased effort to determine ecological impacts. Strikingly, most work on organisms focuses on sublethal responses to plastic debris. This is controversial because (i) researchers have ignored medical insights about the mechanisms that link effects of debris across {{lower levels of}} biological organization to disease and mortality, and (ii) debris is considered non-hazardous by policy-makers, possibly because individuals can be injured or removed from populations and assemblages without ecological impacts. We reviewed the mechanisms that link effects of debris across lower levels of biological organization to assemblages and populations. Using plastic, we show microplastics reduce the ‘health’, feeding, growth and survival of ecosystem engineers. Larger debris alters assemblages because fishing-gear and tyres kill animals and damage habitat-forming plants, and because floating bottles facilitate recruitment and survival of novel taxa. Where ecological linkages are not known, we show how to establish hypothetical links by synthesizing studies to assess the likelihood of impacts. We also consider how population models examine ecological <b>linkages</b> and <b>guide</b> management of ecological impacts.

40|$|Urbanization, climate, and {{ecosystem}} change represent major challenges for managing water resources. Although water systems are complex, a need exists for a generalized representation {{of these systems}} to identify important components and <b>linkages</b> to <b>guide</b> scientific inquiry and aid water management. We developed an integrated Structure-Actor-Water framework (iSAW) to facilitate the understanding of and transitions to sustainable water systems. Our goal was to produce an interdisciplinary framework for water resources research that could address management challenges across scales (e. g., plot to region) and domains (e. g., water supply and quality, transitioning, and urban landscapes). The framework {{was designed to be}} generalizable across all human–environment systems, yet with sufficient detail and flexibility to be customized to specific cases. iSAW includes three major components: structure (natural, built, and social), actors (individual and organizational), and water (quality and quantity). Key linkages among these components include: (1) ecological/hydrologic processes, (2) ecosystem/geomorphic feedbacks, (3) planning, design, and policy, (4) perceptions, information, and experience, (5) resource access and risk, and (6) operational water use and management. We illustrate the flexibility and utility of the iSAW framework by applying it to two research and management problems: understanding urban water supply and demand in a changing climate and expanding use of green storm water infrastructure in a semi-arid environment. The applications demonstrate that a generalized conceptual model can identify important components and linkages in complex and diverse water systems and facilitate communication about those systems among researchers from diverse disciplines...|$|R

40|$|Presented in {{this thesis}} are novel methodologies for the {{analysis}} and optimization of planar, spherical, and spatial linkages associated {{with the problems of}} function generation, path generation, and rigid-body guidance. An up-to-date literature survey in the area of mechanism optimization is also provided in the thesis. Both the input-output (I/O) equation and the I/O curve are employed in the input-output analysis of four-bar linkages. Based on these, the properties of a special class of linkage, the constant-branch linkage, as well as its engineering application are discussed. Two schemes are developed for the optimization of function-generating linkages, namely, a constrained least-square procedure using slack variables and an unconstrained method based on I/O curve planning. The issue of data-conditioning is also discussed so that singularities can be avoided in the optimization procedure. With the help of linkage coordinate systems defined {{in this thesis}}, equations governing the coupler-link motion are derived for both path generation and rigid-body guidance. In the optimization of path-generating and rigid-body <b>guiding</b> <b>linkages,</b> a two-loop scheme based on a constrained least-square procedure is first proposed. Then, as an extension to I/O curve planning in function generation, a method resorting to input-output-coupler (I/O-C) curve planning is developed for path generation and rigid-body guidance. Using unconstrained approaches, this method simplifies the optimization procedure to a great extent...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, we {{consider}} the geometry of configurations of points generated by arbitrary sets of positions of a rigid body. The goal is to find those points in the moving body that lie on specific algebraic surfaces. The result {{is a set of}} algebraic equations that can be remarkably complex. The problem originates with Burmester’s determination (Burmester 1886 [3]) of points in a body that lie on a circle for an arbitrary set of five planar po-sitions. He used these Burmester points to design a <b>linkage</b> that <b>guided</b> the body through the specified positions. His result was a graphical solution to a set of five quadratic equations in five unknown paramters. Today, these equa-tions are relatively easy to solve numerically, see Suh and Radcliffe (1978) [32], Sandor and Erdman (1984) [26], or McCarthy (2000) [15]. Chen and Roth (1967) [4] introduced a generalization of this problem which seeks points and lines in a moving body that take positions on surfaces as-sociated with articulated chains used to build robot manipulators. See Craig (1989) [5] or Tsai (1999) [34] for a discussion of serial chain robots. Our focus is two-jointed chains that supports a spherical wrist. The center of this wrist traces a surface which is said to be “reachable ” by the chain. Considering the various ways of assembling these articulated chains, we obtain seven reachable algebraic surfaces, and the problem reduces to computing the dimensions of these chains from a set of polynomial equations. It is interesting how quickly the complexity of the problem increases with the number of dimensional parameters and the degree of the surface. The total degree of the polynomial systems that {{we consider}} range from 32 for the simplest to over 4 million for the most complex. The equations have significant internal structure, so it is possible to use a linear product decomposition (Bernshtein 1975 [2] and Morgan et al. (1995) [17]) to provide a better bound on the number of solutions, which range from 10 to over 800, 000.

In the first experiment, seated {{participants were asked to}} reproduce with eyes closed geometric shapes (square or diamond) with the tip of their right index finger in the frontoparallel plane. Their head was either aligned with the trunk or tilted 25 degrees towards the left or right shoulder. Results showed that drawings were subjected to an overall rotation of a few degrees in the opposite direction to the tilt. In two subsequent experiments, the respective contribution of both otoliths and neck receptors to this head tilt effect was investigated. In Experiment 2, seated participants kept their head straight but were subjected to 2. 5 mA vestibular galvanic stimulation (GVS). Results indicated that GVS induced a small but significant deviation of the drawings towards the anode. Finally, in Experiment 3, subjects performed the drawing task either seated upright (seated condition) or lying on their back (supine condition). Unlike in the seated condition, tilting the head towards the shoulders in a supine posture does not modulate afferents from the otolith stimulation and therefore mainly stimulates neck receptors. Head tilt induced rotations of hand-drawn reproductions in both seated and supine conditions, suggesting a significant contribution of neck afferents in the control of hand motion in space in the absence of vision.

(2) How has China 2 ̆ 7 s foreign aid policy between the years 1979 to 2010 influenced the political economy of the Federal Republic of Nigeria? (3) What role has the international community played in the relationship between Nigeria and China?

This study was {{based on the premise that}} the guiding principles which undergird China 2 ̆ 7 s foreign policy formulation, 2 ̆ 2 Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, 2 ̆ 2 are no longer applicable in the 21 st century. This assertion is made due to China 2 ̆ 7 s newly acquired position as the second largest economy in the world. This point is the crux of this research. The methodological approach utilized was case study and comparative analysis. Scholarly books, journals, government websites, and information from multilateral institutions such as the Bretton Woods Institutions and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were consulted. An additional source, AidData, which works closely with the aforementioned multilateral institutions, was also used. The sectors examined in this study include health, education, oil and mining and infrastructure in Nigeria. Time series design was utilized to track the influence of aid over the time period of study for the independent variable, China, and also the antecedent and intervening variables of the international community. The study was informed by two theoretical paradigms, complex interdependence and micro-macro <b>linkage</b> model <b>guided</b> by a political economic perspective highlighting the use of neo-mercantilism and neo classical realism by China. The findings indicate that the sectors of infrastructure and oil and mining are prominent sectors that have received a great deal of attention from China as compared to the global powers and the multilateral institutions. Two reasons can be attributed to this phenomenon: (1) From the Nigerian perspective, the trade and abundant natural resource oil and natural gas in exchange for infrastructure projects has been utilized to help place the country on a more sound economic footing; and (2) From the Chinese perspective, the economic and modernization goals that it wishes to fulfill to help facilitate its rise as a global power are assisted through both the human and natural resources provided by Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|The Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli; hereafter: CRG) {{is one of}} the world's most {{endangered}} {{and least}} studied primates. CRG exist only in a patchy distribution in the southern portion of the Cameroon-Nigeria border region and may have as few as 300 individuals remaining, divided into 14 fragmented subpopulations. Though Western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla spp) probably once inhabited much greater ranges throughout West Africa, today CRG represent the most northern and western distribution of all gorillas and are isolated from Western lowland gorilla populations by more than 250 km. CRG have proved challenging to study and protect, and many of the remaining subpopulations currently exist outside of protected areas. Very little is known about where the various subpopulations range on the landscape or why they occur in a patchy distribution within seemingly intact habitat. Active efforts are currently underway to identify critical habitat for landscape conservation efforts to protect the CRG in this biodiversity hotspot but, to date, a lack of understanding of the relationship between CRG ecology and available habitat has hampered conservation endeavors. This dissertation aims to improve our understanding of CRG ecology and distribution to inform conservation management decision making. This research has four main components. First, I describe the plant diet of one CRG subpopulation (the Mone subpopulation). Successful habitat management for primate conservation requires understanding which plants are important and how these plants vary in availability across the landscape. Using feeding trail sign collected over a 10 month period, I record the components of the CRG diet, evaluate CRG selectivity among herbaceous food species, compare Mone CRG diet to that of another CRG subpopulation, and examine differences in herbaceous food availability in areas used and unused by the CRG. During the study period, the CRG ate 141 different plant parts from 102 different species, 23 of which were quantitatively important in the diet. Similarly to other Western lowland and CRG populations, Landolphia, Aframomum, and Palisota spp, were important staple species for the Mone CRG and Marantochloa purpurea played an important fallback role in their diet. By contrast, Araceae species, like Cercestis camerunensis, may be more important to the CRG at Mone than elsewhere. My results suggest that CRG in the Mone-Mt. Oko region prefer certain foods in their diet, and may also selectively use areas with higher availability of preferred foods. Second, I estimate the Mone subpopulation range and assess both the effects of model choice on resulting range estimates and the conservation utility of various models. Measuring and characterizing the area utilized by a population or species is essential for evaluation of conservation status and for effective allocation of habitat to ensure population persistence. Models considered in this study range from basic traditional approaches (e. g. Minimum Convex Polygon) to newer home range techniques such as Local Convex Hull (LoCoH). I used overlap analysis comparing sub-sampled to complete data sets to evaluate the robustness of various modeling techniques to data limitations. I employed Likelihood Cross Validation Criterion to compare core range model performance. Results suggest that differing LoCoH models produce similar range estimates, are robust to data requirements, provide a good fit for core habitat estimation, and are best able to detect unused habitat within the subpopulation range. LoCoH methods may thus be useful for studies of habitat selection and factors limiting endangered species distributions. However, LoCoH models tend to overfit data, and Kernel methods may provide similar information about animal space use while supporting protection of larger swaths of critical habitat. Subpopulation range analyses for conservation/management planning should therefore explore multiple modeling techniques, and employ both qualitative and quantitative assessments to select the best models to inform decision making for species of conservation concern. Third, I review current use of Least Cost Path modeling techniques for connectivity conservation, and highlight both weaknesses and ways to improve application for species like the Cross River gorilla. Promoting connectivity between areas utilized by isolated subpopulations is essential to maintain population viability in fragmented species like the CRG, where each subpopulation contains relatively few individuals. The most common approach to connectivity design is the Least Cost Path (LCP) analysis, which has been applied to the CRG landscape. This review highlights three weaknesses common in recent LCP analyses. First, LCP models typically rely on remotely-sensed habitat maps, but few studies assess whether such maps are suitable proxies for factors affecting animal movement or consider the effects of adjacent habitats. Secondly, many studies use expert opinion to assign costs associated with landscape features, yet few validate these costs with empirical data or assess model sensitivity to errors in cost assignment. Thirdly, studies that consider multiple, alternative movement paths often propose width or length requirements for linkages without justification. LCP modelling and similar approaches to <b>linkage</b> design <b>guide</b> connectivity planning, yet often lack a biological or empirical foundation. Ecologists must clarify the biological processes on which resistance values are based, explicitly justify cost schemes and scale (grain) of analysis, evaluate the effects of landscape context and sensitivity to cost schemes, and strive to optimize cost schemes with empirical data. Research relating species' fine-grain habitat use to movement across broad extents is desperately needed, as are methods to determine biologically relevant length and width restrictions for linkages. While data on such fine grain habitat use have to date been lacking for the Cross River gorilla, this dissertation research aims to improve our understanding of these variables. Thus, finally, I use hierarchical resource selection functions (RSFs) to examine habitat selection and requirements of the CRG at multiple scales to inform connectivity modeling and conservation planning. Specifically, I employ generalized additive models at the scale of the subpopulation range and conditional logistic regression at the scale of individual movements. Understanding resource and habitat selection by endangered species will better inform conservation planning for protection of both critical habitat, and essential linkages between subpopulations. Results indicate that CRG habitat selection is highly scale dependent. Localized measures of habitat quality strongly influenced selection at the subpopulation or landscape scale, while human activity and food availability are the best predictors of selection at finer scales. Understanding why CRG do not occur in seemingly suitable habitat is crucial for designating critical habitat both within and between CRG subpopulations. My results indicate that conservation planning to maintain critical habitat and connectivity among CRG populations will require an integrative, multi-scale planning approach incorporating large-scale landscape characteristics, human use patterns and CRG food availability. Further fine-scale data collection across the landscape will be necessary to use RSF results in connectivity models to inform conservation of important linkages between subpopulations. This research marks a significant addition to the current limited knowledge about the CRG dietary and spatial ecology and conservation biology. My study results complement past and ongoing research by other PhD students, conservation NGOs, and government officials, and compiling these various works will likely provide us with a more complete understanding of CRG ecology for effective conservation decision makin...|$|R
