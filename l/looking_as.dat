5|$|L'Homme-Rivière is {{a statue}} {{representing}} a log driver at work. The logs are heavily stylized, reduced {{to little more}} than cylinders. The driver and his hook, however, are shown as transforming into a wooden plant. Its location, in a tight space between two tall buildings, gives the sculpture the appearance of travelling down a river gorge. L'Homme-Rivière is highly dynamic, and has been described as <b>looking</b> <b>as</b> though it is about to spill onto the sidewalk. The log driver is a symbolic figure in the history and culture of Quebec, thanks notably to Félix-Antoine Savard's famous novel Menaud, maître draveur.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{travelled}} to White Hart Lane to face Tottenham Hotspur in {{the sixth}} round. The team finished the tie as comfortable 4–0 winners, never <b>looking</b> <b>as</b> though they would crumble once William Gallas scored inside 12 minutes. The one negative from their performance was the dismissal of Graeme Le Saux for a second bookable offence in the second half. Local rivals Fulham were Chelsea's semi-final opponents. A scrappy match, which saw Fulham dominate much of the play but creating little, was settled in Chelsea's favour. Terry scored just before half time, heading the ball through the legs of Louis Saha standing in Fulham's goal.|$|E
5|$|John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer were {{virtually}} unknown before being cast {{in their respective}} roles as Jim and Pam, the central love interests. Krasinski had attended school with B. J. Novak, and the two were friends. Fischer prepared for her audition by <b>looking</b> <b>as</b> boring as possible, creating the original Pam hairstyle. In an interview on NPR's Fresh Air, Fischer recalled the last stages of the audition process for Pam and Jim, with the producers partnering the different potential Pams and Jims (four of each) together to gauge their chemistry. When Fischer finished her scene with Krasinski, {{he told her that}} she was his favorite Pam, to which she reciprocated that he was her favorite Jim. Adam Scott and John Cho both auditioned for the role of Jim, and Kathryn Hahn also auditioned for the role of Pam.|$|E

5|$|With it <b>looking</b> <b>as</b> though Riley {{had murdered}} Lynsey, Doctor Browning is {{released}} from prison and sleeps with Mercedes upon his release whom he begins a relationship with. They spend Christmas with the McQueens' however Myra and Mercedes's relationship is still on bad terms. In order to help Mercedes fix {{her relationship with her}} mother, Doctor Browning makes a fake doctor's record claiming that Myra is dying from cancer. Myra and Mercedes fix their relationship as they both believe that Myra is dying. When Mercedes discovers the truth, she is furious with Doctor Browning although forgives him as he has helped her and Myra mend their relationship. Doctor Browning pretends that the doctors record was a mistake and that Myra is not dying. Because of this error, Doctor Browning's job is put on the line and his boss Davies demands sex with Mercedes in order to save Doctor Browning's career. Mercedes agrees to this, however, plans to scam Davies. Her scam fails and Davies almost rapes her, however she is saved by Doctor Browning.|$|E

Bellator commentator Jimmy Smith accredited the fight <b>looking</b> <b>as</b> it did to Shamrock's lack of technique and durability, and said if it was fixed, Bellator wasn't in on the deal.|$|E

The message was often laxly quoted with a line break {{in the middle of}} this sentence, leading some readers to mistakenly believe that [...] "Mars will <b>look</b> <b>as</b> large as the full moon to the naked eye" [...] when, in reality, this sentence means that Mars enlarged 75 times will <b>look</b> <b>as</b> big as the moon unenlarged.|$|R

However, since then, the number of participants has tended to stagnate.

The galosh was soft and gummy in warm weather and hard and stiff in the cold. The style of men's shoes closely mirrored that of women's, as they were narrow, heelless slippers with low-cut vamps. They were very flimsy <b>looking,</b> <b>as</b> though they were held on by suction cups, for the leather barely covered the toes and hardly gripped the heel.|$|E

On 23 March 2015 Derry and assistant manager Greg Abbott were sacked after winning only three games in 24 matches since November 2014.|$|E

25|$|Day three {{began with}} a dejected England <b>looking</b> <b>as</b> though {{they knew they had}} no hope of extracting a victory from the test, and also knowing they would have to bat out at least two days to salvage a draw. But that was yet to come, as Border and Healy resumed Australia's mammoth total. England got the early {{breakthrough}} though, dismissing Healy, clean bowled by Fraser, second ball of the day without adding to the overnight total. Off-spinner Trevor Hohns joined captain Border, and the pair batted through the morning taking Australia past 600. Border unselfishly stuck to his declaration target of 600, even though it left his 35 shy of a century on 65, and declared Australia's innings closed shortly before lunch on 602 for 6, the second time in the series Australia had passed 600.|$|E
25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and <b>looking</b> <b>as</b> conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E

[...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said the clip was [...] "snazzy-looking", but commented, [...] "it feels … kind of gross." [...] BET's Sound Off Blog said, [...] "the visual embodies {{exactly what the}} title represents- transforming into abnormal objects while doing splits and showing off some several thick wasted PYT’s."

500|$|The presidential {{campaign}} of 1904, as Roosevelt sought election {{in his own}} right, brought Mr. Dooley ample opportunity to comment.

They got Senator Fairbanks to accept... by showing him a picture of our great and noble president trying to jump a horse over a six-foot fence".
