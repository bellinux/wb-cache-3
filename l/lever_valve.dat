5000|$|The {{steam engine}} was {{designed}} as a two-cylinder inside drive with a simple inside <b>lever</b> <b>valve</b> gear (Hebelsteurung) without a steam expansion stage. The engine drove the second coupled axle.|$|E
50|$|A {{steam brake}} can be {{operated}} directly by a <b>lever</b> (<b>valve)</b> and also indirectly {{together with the}} vacuum brake. In the latter case, a control valve linked to the vacuum system controls the admission of steam to the brake cylinder, so that the steam brake can be activated automatically in an emergency or if the train separates (the so-called 'automatic steam brake').|$|E
50|$|Like the Adler, few {{original}} design documents existed {{at that time}} from which the replica could be built. The basis of the new design drew heavily on a blueprint of the original drawings from 1838. The dimensions and technical data were derived from the book published in 1839 by NNW Meissner. One problem that soon {{came to the fore}} was that building a replica using the original manufacturing techniques was, for various reasons, not possible. In building the boiler current regulations had to be followed. The steam engine was a major headache. Originally the Saxonia only had a simple <b>lever</b> <b>valve</b> gear which did not enable any kind of steam admission control. For the replica Saxonia a Stephenson valve gear with open rods was planned.|$|E

50|$|The Wakefield {{mechanical}} lubricator was mounted further {{back on the}} 502. These locomotives were also fitted with Ross pop safety valves as built. The 1913 batch had <b>lever</b> safety <b>valves</b> changed to Ross pop type after first major overhaul after 10 years.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{ballcock}} or {{float valve}} {{is often used}} to regulate the filling of a tank or cistern. When the fluid level drops, the float descends, <b>levering</b> the <b>valve</b> opening and allowing more fluid to enter. Once the float reached the 'full' position, the arm presses the valve shut again.|$|R
5000|$|Multi-port {{ball valves}} with 4 ways, or more, are also commercially available, the inlet way often being {{orthogonal}} {{to the plane}} of the outlets. For special applications, such as driving air-powered motors from forward to reverse, the operation is performed by rotating a single <b>lever</b> four-way <b>valve.</b> The 4-way ball valve has two L-shaped ports in the ball that do not interconnect, sometimes referred to as an [...] "×" [...] port.|$|R
50|$|Although the <b>lever</b> safety <b>valve</b> was convenient, {{it was too}} {{sensitive}} to the motion of a steam locomotive. Early steam locomotives therefore used a simpler arrangement of weights stacked directly upon the valve. This required a smaller valve area, so as to keep the weight manageable, which sometimes proved inadequate to vent the pressure of an unattended boiler, leading to explosions. An even greater hazard was {{the ease with which}} such a valve could be tied down, so as to increase the pressure and thus power of the engine, at further risk of explosion.|$|R
50|$|The gas {{pressure}} in a siphon drives soda water {{up through a}} tube inside the siphon when a <b>valve</b> <b>lever</b> at the top is depressed. Commercial soda siphons came pre-charged with water and gas, and were returned to the retailer for exchange when empty. A deposit scheme ensured they were not otherwise thrown away.|$|R
25|$|The Walschaerts gear can {{be linked}} to inside or outside {{admission}} valves. This article has only considered inside-admission piston valves until now, but outside-admission valves (slide valves and some piston valves) can use Walschaerts valve gear. If the valves have outside admission the radius bar connects to the combination <b>lever</b> below the <b>valve</b> stem rather than above.|$|R
50|$|Siphons are {{sometimes}} employed as automatic machines, {{in situations where}} it is desirable to turn a continuous trickling flow or an irregular small surge flow into a large surge volume. A common {{example of this is}} a public restroom with urinals regularly flushed by an automatic siphon in a small water tank overhead. When the container is filled, all the stored liquid is released, emerging as a large surge volume that then resets and fills again. One way to do this intermittent action involves complex machinery such as floats, chains, <b>levers,</b> and <b>valves,</b> but these can corrode, wear out, or jam over time. An alternate method is with rigid pipes and chambers, using only the water itself in a siphon as the operating mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The Tonophone, {{played by}} a pinned {{cylinder}} instead of being operated by direct mechanical linkages, was pneumatically operated. The cylinder pins lifted <b>levers</b> which opened <b>valves</b> to a pneumatic mechanism which operated the piano. First shown at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, the Tonophone {{won a gold medal}} at the exhibition, and went on to be a commercial success. Today, there are thought to be fewer than four complete and working Tonophones left in the world.|$|R
50|$|The piston {{carriages}} were six-wheeled vans, with a driver's platform at each end, as {{they were}} double ended. The driver's position was within the carriage, not in the open. The centre axle was unsprung, and the piston assembly was directly connected to it. The driver had a vacuum gauge (a mercury manometer, connected by a metal tube {{to the head of}} the piston. Some vehicles were fitted with speedometers, an invention of Moses Ricardo. As well as a brake, the driver had a by-pass valve which admitted air to the partially exhausted traction tube ahead of the piston, reducing the tractive force exerted. This seems to have been used on the 1 in 50 descent from the flyover. The <b>lever</b> and <b>valve</b> arrangement are shown in a diagram in Samuda's Treatise.|$|R
50|$|Normal {{procedure}} {{was to leave}} the main air induction valve open until the engines {{had a chance to}} come to a full stop, this operation being so timed as to occur just prior to complete submergence. In the case of S-5, however, the chief of the boat, Gunner's Mate Percy Fox, the man responsible for operating this valve, was momentarily distracted. Noticing the mistake, he grabbed the <b>valve</b> <b>lever</b> and jerked hard, causing the valve to jam open.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{systems were}} train stops, as still {{used by the}} New York City Subway, the Toronto subway, the London Underground, the Moscow Subway (only on the older lines) and the Berlin S-Bahn. Beside every signal is a moveable arm. If the signal is red, <b>levers</b> connected to <b>valves</b> on any passing train hit the arm, opening the brake line, applying the emergency brake, If the signal shows green, the arm is {{turned away from the}} levers and there is no contact.|$|R
50|$|The {{hand-operated}} {{gear and}} rear-wheel brake controls {{are on the}} driver's right {{but there is a}} door for the driver which there was not on the 30-98 or 25. The spark and throttle levers are on the steering wheel together with an air <b>lever</b> working a <b>valve</b> in the induction pipe (after the throttle). There is also a mixture control (choke) on the dash. Gear and brake levers are well to hand. Accelerator and (transmission) brake pedals were set close together.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, {{desmodromic}} drive uses two cams per valve, {{each with}} separate rocker arm (<b>lever</b> tappets). Maximum <b>valve</b> acceleration being limited by cam-to-tappet galling stress, {{is governed by}} moving mass and cam contact area. Rigidity and contact stress are best achieved with conventional flat tappets and springs whose lift and closure stress is unaffected by spring force, both occurring at the base circlewhere spring load is minimum and contact radius is largest.Curved (lever) tappetsof desmodromic cams cause higher contact stress than flat tappets for the same lift profile, thereby limiting rate of lift and closure.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} known {{reference to}} a vending machine is {{in the work of}} Hero of Alexandria, an engineer and mathematician in first-century Roman Egypt. His machine accepted a coin and then dispensed holy water. When the coin was deposited, it fell upon a pan attached to a lever. The <b>lever</b> opened a <b>valve</b> which let some water flow out. The pan continued to tilt with the weight of the coin until it fell off, at which point a counterweight snapped the lever up and turned off the valve.|$|R
50|$|This was a vessel, B, {{capable of}} being tightly closed by a screw, D, and a lid, C, in which food could be cooked in water raised by a furnace, A, to the {{temperature}} due to any desired safe pressure of steam. The pressure was determined and limited by a weight, W; on the safety <b>valve</b> <b>lever,</b> G. It is probable that this essential attachment to the steam boiler had previously been used for other purposes; but Papin is given the credit of having first made use of it to control the pressure of steam.|$|R
500|$|After {{completing}} the emergency dive at about 13:40, Waddle invited {{two of the}} civilian guests, John Hall, CEO of a Texas oil company, and Jack Clary, a free-lance sports writer from Massachusetts, to operate the controls for the emergency main ballast blow. Clary sat in the helmsman's chair and Hall stood at the high-pressure air <b>valve</b> <b>levers,</b> under close supervision by Greeneville crewmen. [...] After the two civilians had taken their positions, at 13:42:25 Waddle ordered the maneuver executed, and they threw the control levers as instructed. [...] The submarine began its rapid ascent toward the surface.|$|R
5000|$|Each valve was a wood disc {{with leather}} facing on both sides. One face had a center hole {{leading to a}} pocket of a larger {{diameter}} in the wood. The valve was supported only by a <b>lever</b> between the <b>valve</b> plate pivot and the pouch lifter disc, with a right angle dowel extension that [...] "plugged in" [...] the center hole of the valve button. The pivotal lever is easily removable {{because it was not}} cemented to the valve, rendering a loose valve button in the valve well behind the valve plate that was screwed onto the valve chest with white sealing compound.|$|R
2500|$|When the diver {{starts to}} inhale, {{the removal of}} gas from the casing lowers the {{pressure}} inside the chamber, and the external water pressure moves the diaphragm inwards operating a lever. This lifts the valve off its seat, releasing gas into the chamber. The inter-stage gas, at about [...] over ambient pressure, expands through the valve orifice as its pressure is reduced to ambient and supplies the diver with more gas to breathe. When the diver stops inhaling the chamber fills until the external pressure is balanced, the diaphragm returns to its rest position and the <b>lever</b> releases the <b>valve</b> to be closed by the valve spring and gas flow stops.|$|R
50|$|Built by the Merryweather Fire Engine {{company in}} Greenwich, in 1888, the Butler Petrol Cycle (first {{recorded}} {{use of the}} term) was a three-wheeled petrol vehicle. The rear wheel was directly driven by a 5/8hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in3; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm}) flat twin four-stroke engine (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery), equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor (five years before Maybach), and Ackermann steering, {{all of which were}} state of the art at the time. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a throttle <b>valve</b> <b>lever.</b> The driver was seated between the front wheels.|$|R

40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the camshafts, the <b>levers</b> of <b>valve</b> motion, {{the wheels of}} gear box, the {{reduction}} gears of rear axle. The purposes are to rise the durability of car parts by the surface hardening, to create the group of new steels and irons with the increased manufacturability. The fluid nitriding process in the cyanate bathes, the saturation process by the nitrogen and by the carbon at the low temperatures in the atmosphere of ammonia and exogas have been created for the first time. The conception of step-by-step nitrocarburizing cycle, the new low-alloy steels have been developed. The processes of fluid nitriding, of gas nitriding in the exogas-ammonia mixture, the nitrocarburizing process with the oxidizing, the process of rebuilding hardening of camshafts, 10 new marks of steels and irons have been developed. The furnaces for the chemical heat treatment with 600 kg/h output, BG irons, ATs 20 KhGF, ATs 40 KhGFB steels have been put into operation.

5000|$|Supervisory control {{often takes}} {{one of two}} forms. In one, the {{controlled}} machine or process continues autonomously. It is observed {{from time to time}} by a human who, when deeming it necessary, intervenes to modify the control algorithm in some way. In the other, the process accepts an instruction, carries it out autonomously, reports the results and awaits further commands. With manual control, the operator interacts directly with a controlled process or task using switches, <b>levers,</b> screws, <b>valves</b> etc., to control actuators. This concept was incorporated in the earliest machines which sought to extend the physical capabilities of man. In contrast, with automatic control, the machine adapts to changing circumstances and makes decisions in pursuit of some goal which {{can be as simple as}} switching a heating system on and off to maintain a room temperature within a specified range. Sheridan [...] defines supervisory control as follows: [...] "in the strictest sense, supervisory control means that one or more human operators are intermittently programming and continually receiving information from a computer that itself closes an autonomous control loop through artificial effectors to the controlled process or task environment." ...|$|R
5000|$|... in 1895, {{the first}} {{four-stroke}} engine {{was ready for}} production. The 138 cc (bore 50 mm, stroke 70 mm) single cylinder engine with a surface carburettor produced 0.5 HP at an engine speed of 1500 RPM, a remarkably high speed for the time. For comparison: Hildebrand & Wolfmüller reached 240 RPM, the Daimler Reitwagen motor ran at maximum 750 RPM. Bouton {{found out that the}} glowplug ignition was the obstacle to higher speeds. He developed a high voltage ignition system for the motor with circuit breaker. The dry battery for the ignition is located under the upper frame tube (in the case of a motor tricycle); ignition timing could be adjusted with a small <b>lever.</b> Side <b>valves</b> were driven via a gear-driven camshaft, with automatic snifting valve activation. The advantage of the design should have been very early (0-5 degrees before top dead centre) opening inlet valve. The cylinder head was removable and bolted with four bolts on the crank case. The weight of the existing cast iron engine including all auxiliary units amounted to less than 20 kg. [...] "The benefits of this engine were simplicity and ease." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{auxiliary}} crankshaft drove {{both the}} eccentric rods {{and the combination}} <b>levers</b> of the <b>valve</b> gear. The piston valves were of the outside admission type. The valve heads were connected by a double girder arrangement, each actuated by a vertical rocking shaft located between the two girders and midway between the two heads, with a further connecting link pivoted just behind the valve head nearest the front. A sealed oscillating shaft drove the offset upper rocker arm and link, and the whole assembly worked inside the exhaust space of the steam chest. The advantage of having admission steam working on the outside faces of the valves meant that the volume under maximum pressure was completely sealed at the ends with no glands susceptible to leakage.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Most of the {{existing}} teapot need people control water, labour intensity of people is increased. According to the deficiency, Pure mechanical automatic teapot was designed. The teapot was mainly composed of storage device, holder, check <b>valve,</b> <b>lever</b> mechanism etc. Check valve was under Spherical surface contact. Check valve would be closed when the valve core {{got in touch with}} seal ring. Water outflow from the check valve when Valve core moved from down to up. The lever mechanism was designed in the base of teapot. Cup holder was designed on one side, tie rod which was welded a steel ball was designed on the other side.

50|$|Recklinghausen is {{primarily}} remembered for {{his study of}} blood pressure, and contributions made in the science of blood pressure measurement. He is credited for making improvements to Scipione Riva-Rocci's (1863-1937) sphygmomanometer by increasing {{the size of the}} pressure cuff from 5cm to 10cm. During the 1930s he devised an oscillo-tonometer; a device used to measure systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It consisted of a mechanical amplification system connected to an oscillating needle and dial, two cuffs (a 5 cm cuff overlapping a 10 cm cuff) being connected to single inflation bulb, a control <b>lever,</b> a release <b>valve</b> and two tambours (one being connected to the atmosphere and the other to the lower cuff). With Recklinghausen's oscillotonometer, a stethoscope was not needed to listen for Korotkoff sounds, they were instead represented as oscillations of a needle.|$|R
50|$|Oxygen partial {{pressure}} in a passive addition system {{is controlled by}} the breathing rate of the diver. Feed gas is added by a valve which is equivalent to an open circuit demand valve in function, which opens to supply gas when the counterlung is empty - the moving top plate of the counterlung works like the diaphragm of a demand valve to operate the <b>lever</b> opening the <b>valve</b> when the counterlung volume is low. The volume may be low because the internal bellows has discharged a part of the previous breath to the environment, or because an increase in depth has caused the contents to be compressed, or a combination of these causes. The oxygen used by the diver also slowly decreases the volume of gas in the loop.|$|R
25|$|Most {{cylinder}} valves {{are currently}} of the K-valve type, {{which is a}} simple manually operated screw-down on-off valve. In the mid-1960s, J-valves were widespread. J-valves contain a spring-operated valve that is restricts or shuts off flow when tank pressure falls to 300-500 psi, causing breathing resistance and warning the diver {{that he or she}} is dangerously low on air. The reserve air is released by pulling a reserve <b>lever</b> on the <b>valve.</b> J-valves fell out of favor with the introduction of pressure gauges, which allow divers to keep track of their air underwater, especially as the valve-type is vulnerable to accidental release of reserve air and increases the cost and servicing of the valve. J-valves are occasionally still used when work is done in visibility so poor that the pressure gauge cannot be seen, even with a light.|$|R

25|$|Large {{vehicles}} are usually fitted with power operated or power assisted parking brakes. Power assisted parking brakes are usually found on large vans {{as well as}} some older heavy vehicles. These operate {{in the same way as}} a conventional parking brakes, but pulling the <b>lever</b> operates a <b>valve</b> that allows air or hydraulic pressure or vacuum into a cylinder which applies force to the brake shoes and makes applying the parking brake easier. When releasing the parking brake, the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with air operated brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the parking brake when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes. A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of power assistance is available with the engine off.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Attachments {{and their}} {{controls}} can {{be connected to}} hydraulic mobile machines in different ways. The traditional approach is to install hydraulic valves of the attachment close to the operator. Thereby <b>levers</b> of the <b>valves</b> can be reached from the operator seat. This, however, restricts the size and number of the valves and can be inconvenient for the operator. A more advanced and ergonomic way is to use electronic control which allows installing the valves more freely on the attachment. The operator can then control the attachment with a joystick, for example. Usually there is a microcontroller unit in an electronically controlled mobile machine. One solution is to use this unit to read the joysticks and output control signals to the valves of the attachment. However, {{if there is a}} microcontroller in the attachment as well, the wiring can be minimized and the attachment can perform intelligent functions, for exampl...|$|R
