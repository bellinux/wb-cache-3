5|$|After {{holding the}} two Michelin stars until 1988, and then <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> single star in 1991, in 1992 the {{restaurant}} went into receivership and {{was purchased by}} Helen Avis. Under chef Thierry LePratre-Granet, the restaurant was restored to a single Michelin star in 1996.

5000|$|Schweizer {{notes that}} some early {{versions}} have this verse read [...] "earth <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> salt" [...] rather than [...] "salt <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> flavour" [...] {{and is thus}} an illustration of how important the disciples are to the world. Hill notes {{that there is an}} entirely different understanding, which is that Jesus was well aware that salt cannot <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> flavour and the message is that if the disciples remain true to their Christianity they will never lose their influence and importance.|$|R
5|$|At Fontainebleau, Catherine {{arranged}} entertainments {{that lasted}} for several days, including fancy-dress jousting and chivalrous events in allegorical settings. On Mardi Gras, {{the day after the}} banquet in the meadow, knights dressed as Greeks and Trojans fought over scantily clad damsels trapped by a giant and a dwarf in a tower on an enchanted island. The fighting climaxed with the tower <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> magical properties and bursting into flames. In another spectacle, singing sirens swam past the king, and Neptune floated by in a chariot drawn by seahorses.|$|E
5|$|Early on April15, Sudal passed {{very near}} the {{uninhabited}} Japanese island of Iwo Jima as a rapidly weakening typhoon; at the time, its circulation center was exposed from the deepest convection. Shortly thereafter, both the JTWC and JMA downgraded Sudal to tropical storm status. Late on April15, the JTWC assessed the storm as becoming extratropical, although the JMA maintained advisories until the following day. As an extratropical storm, Sudal continued northeastward until <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> identity early on April18, well east of Japan and far south of the Aleutian Islands.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{restoration}} of the monarchy in 1660, and the removal of the garrison from York in 1688, the city was dominated by the gentry and merchants, although the clergy were still important. Competition from Leeds and Hull, together with silting of the River Ouse, resulted in York <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> pre-eminent position as a trading centre but the city's role as the social and cultural centre for wealthy northerners was on the rise. York's many elegant townhouses, such as the Lord Mayor's Mansion House and Fairfax House date from this period, as do the Assembly Rooms, the Theatre Royal, and the racecourse.|$|E

5|$|In 1967 {{categories}} for Novelette, Fan Writer, and Fan Artist were added, and a category for Best Novella was added the following year; these new categories {{had the effect}} of providing a definition for what word count qualified a work for what category, which was previously left up to voters. Novelettes had also been awarded prior to the codification of the rules. The fan awards were initially conceived as separate from the Hugo Awards, with the award for Best Fanzine <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> status, but were instead absorbed into the regular Hugo Awards by the convention committee.|$|E
5|$|On 31 March 2014, Heston Blumenthal {{announced}} he would be closing the restaurant for renovations for 6 months and temporarily relocating it with its entire team to Crown Towers, Melbourne, Australia. The restaurant will be called The Fat Duck for 6 months before being renamed Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. This will be the second restaurant with that name and will be Blumenthal's first restaurant outside of Britain, and his sixth in total. This temporary closure of the Bray location caused the restaurant to become ineligible for assessment for the 2016 Michelin Guide, thus <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> 3-starred status which it regained the following year.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Alby was {{regarded}} as the most devastating tropical cyclone to impact southwestern Western Australia on record. Forming out of an {{area of low pressure}} on 27March 1978, Alby steadily developed as it tracked southwestward, parallel to Western Australia. Between 1 and 2April, the storm quickly intensified and attained its peak intensity as a Category5 cyclone on the Australian cyclone intensity scale. After turning to the southeast, the storm underwent an extratropical transition as it neared Cape Leeuwin. The storm brushed the cape on 4April, bringing hurricane-force winds, before rapidly <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> identity the following day.|$|E

5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{initially}} forecast further intensification to 60mph (95km/h), {{although the}} agency {{also noted that}} the circulation could dissipate, due its fast forward motion toward the east-northeast. Ultimately, wind shear prohibited significant strengthening, and Leslie attained peak winds of 45mph (70km/h). The storm interacted with an approaching cold front and became extratropical on October7, 375mi (600km) north of Bermuda. It accelerated to the northeast and passed over Newfoundland on October8. The remnants of Leslie turned to the east, then southeast, strengthening to near-hurricane-force winds before <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> identity near Ireland on October10.|$|E
5|$|The novel extrapolates Balzac's {{analysis}} of desire {{from the individual}} to society; he feared that the world, like Valentin, was <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> way due to material excess and misguided priorities. In the gambling house, the orgiastic feast, the antique shop, and the discussions with men of science, Balzac examines this dilemma in various contexts. The lust for social status to which Valentin is led by Rastignac is emblematic of this excess; the gorgeous but unattainable Foedora symbolizes the pleasures offered by high society.|$|E
5|$|The raid {{exposed the}} {{weaknesses}} of the Medway defences {{and led to the}} castle <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> role as an artillery fortification. New and stronger forts were built further downriver over the following two centuries, culminating in the construction of massive casemated forts such as Garrison Point Fort, Hoo, and Darnet Forts. Upnor Castle became a naval ammunition depot, storing great quantities of gunpowder, ammunition, and cannon to replenish the warships that came to Chatham for repair and resupply. It remained in military use until as late as 1945. The castle was subsequently opened to the public and is now an English Heritage property.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} had escalated when, in 40 AD, Caligula {{announced to the}} senate {{that he planned to}} leave Rome permanently and to move to Alexandria in Egypt, where he hoped to be worshipped as a living god. The prospect of Rome <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> emperor and thus its political power was the final straw for many. Such a move would have left both the senate and the Praetorian Guard powerless to stop Caligula's repression and debauchery. With this in mind Chaerea convinced his fellow conspirators to put their plot into action quickly.|$|E
5|$|With the {{prospect}} of <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> home, the Arts Club opted to sell {{one of the most}} valuable items in its collection to finance the purchase of new land. The club decided to sell Brâncuși's Bird to the Art Institute of Chicago. To finance the purchase, the Art Institute sold several second tier works from its famous Impressionist collection at Sotheby's in guaranteed lots which was a new concept in the auction world in 1990. While without permanent home, the club continued to meet regularly in space loaned by the Casino, another famous Near North Side club.|$|E
5|$|A {{decreased}} budget led to Nokomis <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> Saturday {{operating hours}} in 2004. The Nokomis East Neighborhood Association, Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, {{and members of}} the community subsequently put funds towards keeping the library open on Saturdays until in mid-2005 when money was reallocated in the budget for continued Saturday operation. Further budget woes continued to plague the Minneapolis Public Libraries as of early 2007, by which point the system had had to temporarily close three different branches in part due to a loss of local government aid. A merger with the Hennepin County Libraries was approved by both systems' boards along with the Minneapolis City Council and Nokomis reopened at 10 am on January 2, 2008, as a Hennepin County Library. It remained the only building in the newly expanded 41-library system to be named for a fictional character.|$|E
