5|$|On 29 April 1970, South Vietnamese and U.S. units {{unleashed}} a limited, multi-pronged Cambodian Campaign that Washington hoped would solve three problems: First, {{it would provide}} a shield for the American withdrawal from Vietnam (by destroying the PAVN logistical system and killing enemy troops) in Cambodia; second, it would provide a test for the policy of Vietnamization; third, it {{would serve as a}} signal to Hanoi that Nixon meant business. Despite Nixon's appreciation of Lon Nol's position, the Cambodian leader was not even informed in advance of the decision to send troops into his country. He <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> it only after it had begun from the head of the U.S. mission, who had himself <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> it from a radio broadcast.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} empirical {{and theoretical}} {{issue in the}} study of learning is the manner in which one’s <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> one cue affects <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> another cue. In most cases, one’s <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> one cue competes with <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> other cues (i. e., overshadowing or blocking), and these cue competition effects have inspired and guided some of the most influential ideas about the mechanisms of learning (see, e. g., Rescorla & Wagner, 1972). In other cases, the presence of one cue can facilitate <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> a second cue. For example, taste cues have been found to facilitate <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> odor cues in food aversion learning (e. g., Rusiniak, Palmerino, Rice, Forthman, & Garcia, 1982). Most studies of interactions among cues (i. e., cue com-petition or cue facilitation) have been done with the use of stimuli available in conditioning chambers. Recently, how...|$|R

5|$|One of the {{individuals}} that Hergé could have <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> through Blanchard's article was the Chicago-based American gangster Al Capone. In the preceding story, Tintin in the Congo, Capone had been introduced as a character within the series. There, {{he was responsible for}} running a diamond smuggling racket that Tintin exposed, setting up for further confrontation in Tintin in America. Capone was one of only two real-life individuals to be named in The Adventures of Tintin, and was the only real-life figure to appear as a character in the series. In the original version, Hergé avoided depicting him directly, either illustrating the back of his head, or hiding his face behind a scarf; this was altered in the second version, in which Capone's face was depicted. It is not known if Capone ever <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> his inclusion in the story, although during initial serialisation he would have been preoccupied with his trial and ensuing imprisonment.|$|E

5000|$|In {{considering}} curriculum using {{a holistic}} approach, one {{must address the}} question of what children need to learn. Since holistic education seeks to educate the whole person, there are some key factors that are essential to this type of education. First, children need to <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> themselves. This involves learning self-respect and self-esteem. Second, children need to <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> relationships. In <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> their relationships with others, there is a focus on social [...] "literacy" [...] (learning to see social influence) andemotional [...] "literacy" [...] (one's own self in relation to others). Third, children need to <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> resilience. This entails overcoming difficulties, facing challenges and learning how to ensure long-term success. Fourth, children need to <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> aesthetics - This encourages the student to see the beauty of what is around them and learn to have awe in life.|$|R
