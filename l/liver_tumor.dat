The electrodes are {{inserted into the}} <b>liver</b> <b>tumor</b> under ultrasound image guidance using percutaneous, laparoscopic or open surgical approach. It is suitable for small tumors (<5nbsp&cm). RFA has the best outcomes in patients with a solitary tumor less than 4nbsp&mm. Since it is a local treatment and has minimal effect on normal healthy tissue, it can be repeated multiple times. Survival is better for those with smaller tumors. In one study, In one series of 302 patients, the three-year survival rates for lesions >5nbsp&cm, 2.1 to 5nbsp&cm, and ≤2nbsp&cm were 59, 74, and 91 percent, respectively. A large randomized trial comparing surgical resection and RFA for small HCC showed similar 4 year survival and less morbidities for patients treated with RFA.|$|E

2500|$|Liver {{transplantation}} {{to replace}} the diseased liver with a cadaveric liver or a living donor graft has historically low survival rates (20%-36%). During 1996–2001 the rate had improved to 61.1%, likely related to adoption of the Milan criteria at US transplantation centers. Expanded Shanghai criteria in China resulted in overall survival and disease-free survival rates similar to the Milan criteria. Studies from the late 2000 obtained higher survival rates ranging from 67% to 91%. If the <b>liver</b> <b>tumor</b> has metastasized, the immuno-suppressant post-transplant drugs decrease the chance of survival. Considering this objective risk {{in conjunction with the}} potentially high rate of survival, some recent studies conclude that: [...] "LTx can be a curative approach for patients with advanced HCC without extrahepatic metastasis". For those reasons, and others, it is considered nowadays that patient selection is a major key for success.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate whether the ARFI technology can differentiate cavernous hemangioma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastatic <b>liver</b> <b>tumors</b> in patients with liver dysfunction. Materials and Methods : Forty patients with liver dysfunction and <b>liver</b> <b>tumors</b> were enrolled in the study. The shear wave velocities (SWVs) in the <b>tumors</b> and background <b>liver</b> were examined by ARFI elastography under ultrasonography (US). Results : The SWVs in livers bearing HCCs were significantly higher than those of livers bearing cavernous hemangiomas. The SWVs in HCCs and metastatic <b>liver</b> <b>tumors</b> were significantly higher than those in cavernous hemangiomas. The SWVs in metastatic <b>liver</b> <b>tumors</b> were significantly higher than those in HCCs. The SWV ratio of metastatic liver tumor/parenchyma was significantly higher than that of cavernous hemangioma/parenchyma and HCC/parenchyma. There was a significant correlation between the tumor sizes and the SWVs in metastatic <b>liver</b> <b>tumors.</b> Conclusions : We herein demonstrated that ARFI elastography could noninvasively provide helpful information, without the need for biopsy, that could be used for the differential diagnosis among cavernous hemangiomas, HCCs and metastatic <b>liver</b> <b>tumors</b> in patients with liver dysfunction. 博士(医学) 秋田大...|$|R

40|$|Radiofrequency {{ablation}} (RFA) {{has been}} widely practiced to treat unresectable malignant <b>liver</b> <b>tumors.</b> It has the merits of localized tumor ablation and preservation of maximal normal liver parenchyma. In recent years, {{there has been a}} tremendous expansion in the application of RFA for patients with malignant <b>liver</b> <b>tumors.</b> However, the therapeutic effect of this local ablation treatment needs to be balanced against its risks and possible local failure. This review focuses on the current status of RFA for malignant <b>liver</b> <b>tumors,</b> with special attention to the indication, approaches, complications, survival benefits, combination therapies, and comparison with other treatment modalities. Although the results of most clinical studies of RFA seem favorable, the associated risks and tumor recurrence should not be underestimated. Careful patient selection, meticulous RFA techniques, and prompt treatment of residual and recurrent tumors are necessary to ensure a better outcome after RFA.

40|$|SummaryThe altered {{metabolism}} of tumors {{has been}} considered a target for anticancer therapy. However, the relationship between distinct tumor-initiating lesions and anomalies of tumor metabolism in vivo has not been addressed.

Increased glutamine catabolism in MYC-induced <b>liver</b> <b>tumors</b> is associated with decreased levels of glutamine synthetase (Glul) and the switch from Gls 2 to Gls 1 glutaminase. In contrast to <b>liver</b> <b>tumors,</b> MYC-induced lung tumors display increased expression of both Glul and Gls 1 and accumulate glutamine. We also show that inhibition of Gls 1 kills cells that overexpress MYC and catabolize glutamine.

As reported earlier, the tumors were not activated by a point mutation in codon 61 of H-ras. Two of the eight tumors examined contained a mutation in codon 13 or an H-ras gene mutated in codon 117. Screening of another 23 ciprofibrate-induced <b>liver</b> <b>tumors</b> by oligonucleotide hybridization analysis and direct DNA sequencing resulted in the identification of three tumor DNA samples with point mutations in codon 117 of the H-ras gene. In addition, another tumor sample contained a K-ras gene with a mutation in codon 61. Mutations in these codons have been seen only rarely in chemically induced <b>liver</b> <b>tumors</b> from this mouse strain. Of 15 spontaneous B 6 C 3 F 1 <b>liver</b> <b>tumors</b> screened in the same manner, one exhibited a K-ras gene activated by a mutation in codon 13 and a second contained an H-ras gene activated by a mutation in codon 117.
