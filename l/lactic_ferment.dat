30|$|Eleven vinegars (Table  1) were {{provided}} by the Central Research Institute of Mizkan Group Corporation. These samples were stored at 4 °C until use. In these 11 vinegars, three kinds of vinegar (high-brix nonglutinous brown rice black vinegar, high-brix nonglutinous brown rice black vinegar matured in barrel and high-brix apple vinegar) have the word “high-brix” in their names. The “high-brix” means that these vinegars were produced using a larger amount of initial material than {{were used in the}} production of vinegars lacking the “high-brix”. The initial material of “high-brix nonglutinous brown rice black vinegar” and “high-brix nonglutinous brown rice black vinegar matured in barrel” was nonglutinous brown rice, and one of “high-brix apple vinegar” was apple juice. High-brix nonglutinous brown rice black vinegar matured in barrel and <b>lactic</b> <b>fermented</b> tomato vinegar, which are not currently available on the market, served as test samples for new commodification. High-brix nonglutinous brown rice black vinegar matured in barrel was produced by the maturation of high-brix nonglutinous brown rice black vinegar at 25 °C for a month in a 20 -L barrel.

As shown in Figure  1, these five samples were made on 3 -L volumes from a single lot of tomatoes through two separate lines. Sample 1 (tomato juice-source) was prepared by mixing crushed tomatoes with water (2.5  kg-tomato/L). For the preparation of sample 2, the tomato juice-source was incubated at 28 °C for 96  h after the addition of 0.5 % (g/v) yeast and 0.3 % (g/v) pectinase (alcoholic fermentation). After alcoholic fermentation, the tomato juice was filtered through filter paper (Advantec grade No. 2 qualitative filter paper; Advantec, Tokyo) and diatomaceous earth, and then heat-treated at 90 °C for 1  min. For the preparation of sample 3, acetic acid bacteria (on the order of 105 cells) were inoculated into the sample 2 (3  L), after which acetic fermentation was proceeded at 32 °C for 110  h.

Milk and cheese quality was affected by livestock system; in fact, milk from extensive farm contained more protein and casein and less fat, urea and somatic cells; then the cheese showed higher cheese yield and protein content and lower fat percentage. In addition, the colour of the cheese from extensive farm resulted more yellow, probably due to the greater transfer of beta-carotene from pasture to milk.

Lactose 6 '-phosphate accumulated to a high concentration (greater than 100 mM) in cells growing on lactose. In contrast, <b>lactic</b> streptococci, which <b>ferment</b> lactose rapidly and use only the lactose-phosphotransferase system for uptake, contained high phospho-beta-galactosidase activity and low concentrations (0. 9 to 1. 6 mM) of lactose 6 '-phosphate.

Hence, {{the development of}} non-dairy fermented products with probiotic properties draws significant attention within the functional foods industry. The microorganisms used in such products have complex enzyme systems through which they generate diverse metabolites (volatile and non-volatile) that provide significant flavour attributes of importance for fermented foods. The correlation of the volatile flavour compounds of a malt beverage fermented with a Bifidobacterium breve strain with its unique sensory characteristics was performed. The volatile composition analysis exposed the presence of 12 components. Eight of these flavour volatiles were produced through the metabolic activity of the bifidobacteria strain. Notably acetic acid, of reported sour flavour characteristics, exhibited the greatest intensity. Four components of considerable organoleptic characteristics were identified as Maillard-derived products, namely maltol, pyranone, 2 (5 H) -furanmethanol and 3 -furanmethanol. The sen-sory evaluation exhibited that the fermented cereal beverage had a sour flavour with mild sweet and malty notes. These {{results indicate that the}} volatile compounds identified can be appointed as significant flavour markers of the novel fermented cereal beverage...|$|R

2500|$|When {{raw milk}} is left {{standing}} for a while, it turns [...] "sour". This {{is the result}} of fermentation, where <b>lactic</b> acid bacteria <b>ferment</b> the lactose in the milk into lactic acid. Prolonged fermentation may render the milk unpleasant to consume. This fermentation process is exploited by the introduction of bacterial cultures (e.g. Lactobacilli sp., Streptococcus sp., Leuconostoc sp., etc.) to produce a variety of fermented milk products. The reduced pH from lactic acid accumulation denatures proteins and causes the milk to undergo a variety of different transformations in appearance and texture, ranging from an aggregate to smooth consistency. Some of these products include sour cream, yogurt, cheese, buttermilk, viili, kefir, and kumis. See Dairy product for more information.|$|R
