25|$|Supervision (<b>line</b> <b>signaling)</b> was {{supplied}} by a District circuit, {{similar to the}} plug and light cord circuit that plugged into a line jack on a switchboard. It supervised the calling and called party and, when both had gone on-hook, released the ground on the sleeve lead, thus releasing all selectors, which returned down to their start position to make ready for further traffic. Some District frames were equipped with the more complex supervisory and timing circuits required to generate coin collect and return signals for handling calls from payphones.|$|E
50|$|<b>Line</b> <b>signaling</b> is a {{class of}} {{telecommunications}} signaling protocols. <b>Line</b> <b>signaling</b> is responsible for off-hook, ringing signal, answer, ground start, on-hook unidirectional supervision messaging in each direction from calling party to called party and vice versa. After an off-hook, <b>line</b> <b>signaling</b> initiates register signaling to accomplish the exchange of telephone numbers of called party and in more modern line-signaling protocols, the calling party as well. While register signaling occurs, <b>line</b> <b>signaling</b> remains quiescent unless the calling party goes on-hook or an abnormal cessation of the call occurs, such as due to equipment malfunction or shutdown or due to network outage upstream in that call-attempt's series of spanned trunks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Line</b> <b>signaling</b> can be {{conveyed}} in {{a single}} DS0 channel of a trunk. In modern PCM telecommunications, <b>line</b> <b>signaling</b> {{is represented by the}} ABCD bits in DS0 #16 of an E1 or a selected DS0 within a T1.|$|E
50|$|R2 <b>line</b> <b>signalling</b> {{variants}} {{that support}} R2 <b>line</b> <b>signalling</b> in its electrical-pulse form by dedicated two-wire or four-wire circuits usually represent each signal as two different pulse lengths (e.g., 150 milliseconds versus 600 milliseconds), {{where the two}} different meanings of those two different pulse lengths varies by context.|$|R

5000|$|E and M {{signaling}} {{is a type}} of supervisory <b>line</b> <b>signaling</b> {{that uses}} DC signals on separate leads, called the [...] "E" [...] lead and [...] "M" [...] lead, traditionally used in the telecommunications industry between telephone switches.

50|$|Metering pulses (depending on the country, {{these are}} 50 Hz, 12 kHz or 16 kHz pulses {{sent by the}} {{exchange}} to payphones or metering boxes) are out-of-band (because they do not fall within the frequency range used by the telephony signal, which is 300 through 3400 Hz) and channel-associated.

50|$|Loop {{start is}} a {{telecommunications}} supervisory protocol between a central office or {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) and a subscriber telephone {{for the purpose of}} starting and terminating a telephone call. It is the simplest of the telephone signaling systems, and uses {{the presence or absence of}} loop current to indicate the off-hook and on-hook loop states, respectively. It is used primarily for subscriber <b>line</b> <b>signaling.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{hardware}} {{also has}} multiple legitimate applications. While a telephone exchange includes a central source of ringing voltage at the switchboard, a {{private branch exchange}} or telephone-based intercom must provide a local source of AC ringing voltage. Theatrical performances often deploy a ringing telephone on-stage as a stage prop. An analog telephone adapter for voice over IP applications has to provide its own ringing voltage generator and other <b>line</b> <b>signaling</b> services for standard telephone extensions. The hardware may also be useful to technicians for test purposes.|$|E
50|$|The DSLAM {{acts like}} a network switch since its {{functionality}} is at Layer 2 of the OSI model.

The DSLAM traffic is switched to a Broadband Remote Access Server where the end-user traffic is then routed across the ISP network to the Internet. Customer-premises equipment that interfaces well with the DSLAM {{to which it is}} connected may take advantage of enhanced telephone voice and data <b>line</b> <b>signaling</b> features and the bandwidth monitoring and compensation capabilities it supports.|$|E
