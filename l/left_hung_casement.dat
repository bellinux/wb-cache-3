The main frontage {{of the building}} faces south and is composed of three storeys and a seven window range, the windows are mostly 20th century top <b>hung</b> <b>casements</b> with moulded surrounds and keystones. The front also has a central pediment and the main entrance has an open Doric three bay colonnade.

The colonnade leads on to the taller orangerey which has three tall round arched openings with keystones, all the openings in the orangerey and the colonnade have now been filled in as they have been converted to apartments. The stables stand 200 metres to the north east and are built of ashlars and coursed rubble with a hipped stone slate roof.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} they touched the deer?" [...] All rushed back to where the big deer had been <b>left,</b> <b>hung</b> up in a cool spot in the forest. Evidently the enemy had not seen this game, and it was untouched. Looking around near the water front they found a small box of salt, a spoon, and some {{scattered}} cartridges for the rifle. Evidently the marauders had left in haste and dropped the things on the way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Badly hurt, captain?" [...] he asked, as {{he leaped}} off his horse; for {{the blood was}} {{streaming}} down Reuben's face, and his <b>left</b> arm <b>hung</b> useless.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bostil, how are you?" [...] said Cordts. He {{appeared}} pleasant, {{and certainly}} grateful for being permitted to come there. From his <b>left</b> hand <b>hung</b> a belt containing two heavy guns.|$|R

60|$|In a {{handsome}} room: though its furniture had rather {{the air of}} old-fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance: there sat two ladies at a well-spread breakfast-table. Mr. Giles, dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black, was in attendance upon them. He had taken his station some half-way between the side-board and the breakfast-table; and, with his body drawn up to its full height, his head thrown back, and inclined the merest trifle on one side, his left leg advanced, and his right hand thrust into his waist-coat, while his <b>left</b> <b>hung</b> down by his side, grasping a waiter, looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance.|$|R
60|$|The yellow {{men were}} armed with two swords, {{and a short}} javelin was slung {{across the back of}} each, while from their <b>left</b> arms <b>hung</b> cuplike shields no larger than a dinner plate, the concave sides of which turned outward toward an antagonist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some of {{the boys}} are wounded!" [...] I cried shrilly, turning to Hiram, and then I saw that his <b>left</b> arm <b>hung</b> by his side as if useless, while he held the tiller with his right hand, {{standing}} astride it that his legs might aid him in the grip.|$|R
60|$|The young captain got no further, {{for just}} then there sounded a clatter {{on the outer}} steps, and a second later an American soldier burst into the mill-house. He was in tatters, and his <b>left</b> arm <b>hung</b> limply by his side, for {{he had been shot}} in the shoulder.|$|R
50|$|The Station Main Building's {{northern}} wing comprises three {{rooms and}} a semi-enclosed, west-facing verandah. It is supported on low concrete stumps, and timber and steel posts. Tongue-and-groove jointed boarding lines the ceilings of each {{room and the}} floors are covered in vinyl or carpet. The walls of the central room are sheeted while {{the walls of the}} other two rooms have vertically-jointed boards with moulded belt rails. The rooms contain some solid timber furniture, wall-hung cupboards, and workbenches that appear original to the 1932 construction date. One original timber-boarded door remains in the southern-most room. The original windows are timber-framed and double- <b>hung</b> or <b>casements</b> with fanlights. Air conditioning units have replaced some windows however those remaining retain original brass hardware.|$|R
60|$|It was Randy who {{uttered the}} words, as he danced {{around the floor}} of the living-room, almost on top of the stove. The fire had burned low during the night, and he had just shoved in some fresh wood and opened the draughts. Going to the little window of the sleeping-apartment, he looked through the single pane of glass at the thermometer, which <b>hung</b> on the <b>casement</b> outside. The mercury {{registered}} twenty-two degrees below zero.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper half}} could be worn as a cloak {{draped over the}} <b>left</b> shoulder, <b>hung</b> down over the belt and {{gathered}} up at the front, or brought up over the shoulders or head for protection against weather. It was worn over a l√©ine (a full-sleeved garment stopping below the waist) and could {{also serve as a}} camping blanket.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{previous}} election, held on 5 May 2005, the Labour Party won 39 seats, the Conservative Party 32, the Liberal Democrats 11, and independents two. By {{the end of}} this term, the Liberal Democrats had lost one councillor, and there were three independents. [...] As in the 2001 election, the Council was <b>left</b> <b>hung.</b> For most of these eight years, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats formed a coalition, although Labour is running a minority administration going into the election. On a national level, the Conservative Party are polling well and have targeted Carlisle and Barrow-in-Furness, although Richard Moss, BBC Political Editor for the North East and Cumbria, has said that an absolute majority is unlikely. It {{is considered to be a}} [...] "safer area" [...] than some of the other councils up for election in 2009, but the Liberal Democrats have also been making a push in the region.|$|R

60|$|Entirely {{outfitted}} I {{would not}} have known myself, so strange was my garb and my armament. Upon my back were slung my bow, arrows, shield, and short spear; {{from the center of}} my girdle depended my knife; at my right hip was my stone hatchet; and at my <b>left</b> <b>hung</b> the coils of my long rope. By reaching my right hand over my left shoulder, I could seize the spear or arrows; my left hand could find my bow over my right shoulder, while a veritable contortionist-act was necessary to place my shield {{in front of me and}} upon my left arm. The shield, long and oval, is utilized more as back-armor than as a defense against frontal attack, for the close-set armlets of gold upon the left forearm are principally depended upon to ward off knife, spear, hatchet, or arrow from in front; but against the greater carnivora and the attacks of several human antagonists, the shield is utilized to its best advantage and carried by loops upon the left arm.|$|R
60|$|Taking the tiller, {{he brought}} the boat {{alongside}} the chief, and four of the sailors, directed by Dick, gently raised him from the water and laid him {{on the bottom of}} the boat. Blood was flowing freely from an ugly gash in his face, and it was evident from the manner in which his <b>left</b> arm <b>hung</b> limp, as they lifted him up, that either the shoulder or the arm itself was broken.|$|R
6000|$|... "Another visitor," [...] Guy said. Getting up, he {{slightly}} drew aside a thick curtain that <b>hung</b> {{before a}} <b>casement,</b> {{a moment later}} he let it fall again. [...] "There are two men-at-arms standing {{on the other side of}} the street and one at the door." [...] He heard the door opened, then the boy's step was heard on the stairs, two or three minutes later there was a movement above and the sound of the footsteps of two men coming down. Presently the outside door closed, two or three minutes elapsed; then the door opened and the Italian entered.|$|R
60|$|Without a {{word she}} rose, {{animated}} by the tragic agony of her purpose {{and the force}} of her despair, and glided towards the tent, the great knife in her hand. Now, ah! all too soon, she was inside of it, and stood for a second to allow her eyes to grow accustomed to the light. Presently she began to see, first {{the outline of the}} bed, then the outline of the manly form stretched upon it, then both bed and man distinctly. Jantje had said that he was sleeping like a child. He might have been; now he was not. On the contrary, his face was convulsed like the face of one in an extremity of fear, and great beads of sweat stood upon his brow. It was as though he knew his danger, and yet was utterly powerless to avoid it. He lay upon his back. One heavy arm, his <b>left,</b> <b>hung</b> {{over the side of the}} bed, the knuckles of the hand resting on the ground; the other was thrown back, and his head was pillowed upon it. The clothing had slipped away from his throat and massive chest, which were quite bare.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, William Goldman, {{who loved}} the novel, said he {{actively}} campaigned {{for the job}} of adapting the script, but was astonished by the quality of Coppola's work:I still believe it {{to be one of the}} great adaptations... I called him Coppola and told him what a wonderful thing he had done. If you see the movie, you will find all this hard to believe... The director who was hired, Jack Clayton, is a Brit... he had one thing all of them have in their blood: a murderous sense of class... Well, Clayton decided this: that Gatsby's parties were shabby and tacky, given by a man of no elevation and taste. There went the ball game. As shot, they were foul and stupid and the people who attended them were foul and silly, and Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, who would have been so perfect as Gatsby and Daisy, were <b>left</b> <b>hung</b> out to dry. Because Gatsby was a tasteless fool and why should we care about their love? It was not as if Coppola's glory had been jettisoned entirely, though it was tampered with plenty; it was more that the reality and passions it depicted were gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{we ought}} to be going, too, I guess. I've <b>left</b> my {{business}} <b>hung</b> up at loose ends between two oceans, and it's time to connect again. I just hate to do it, though; haven't had a holiday like this for twenty years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{found myself}} awake and walking. We {{had come out}} above the Pleasure City, we were near the summit of Monte Solaro and looking towards the bay. It was the late {{afternoon}} and very clear. Far away to the <b>left</b> Ischia <b>hung</b> in a golden haze between sea and sky, and Naples was coldly white against the hills, and before us was Vesuvius with a tall and slender streamer feathering at last towards the south, and the ruins of Torre dell' Annunziata and Castellamare glittering and near." ...|$|R
50|$|Master Zhishan's vision blurs as {{the scene}} changes {{to a more}} {{realistic}} scene of {{the aftermath of the}} temple's destruction. Pai Mei's prot√©g√©, area governor Kao Tsin-chung (Kong Do) and his army, chase the fleeing ex-students of Shao Lin. Tung Chin-chin, (Gordon Liu) after watching waves of other students fall to the pursuing army's arrows, makes a heroic last stand to divert their attention. He falls to a hail of arrows, crushing the throats of the soldiers he is closest to. It is <b>left</b> to <b>Hung</b> Hsi-Kuan to lead the remaining students to safety.|$|R
2500|$|In {{an image}} {{broadcast}} {{on the night}} of his arrest, he was shown stepping out of the boat in which he had been hiding.

60|$|The eyes of {{the little}} Belgian were {{sparkling}} like jewels; {{his hands on the}} steering wheel were steady as a rock; he drove with skill and judgment. Just now the road demanded skill, for a stream of refugees was coming toward them from Nieuport and a stream of military motors, bicycles and wagons, with now and then a horseman, flowed toward the front. A mile or two beyond Furnes they came upon a wounded soldier, one leg bandaged and stained with blood while he hobbled along leaning upon the shoulder of a comrade whose <b>left</b> arm <b>hung</b> helpless.|$|R
