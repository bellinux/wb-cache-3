40|$|AbstractDuring {{machining}} of shafts {{with multiple}} shoulders on CNC lathes {{it is necessary}} to obtain the accuracy of all dimensions automatically since re-setup of the machine tool for each individual part would be time consuming. In cases when the process datum is different from the design datum, datum errors may occur. This error may require the reduction of the process tolerance, which may <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> <b>manufacturing</b> costs. The resulting datum error depends on the method of holding the workpiece and the way the cutting tool is set up. This paper analyses the most widely used fixturing and setup methods and estimates the datum errors they may cause...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{aim of the}} {{magnetic}} recording industry is <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> storage capacities and transfer rates whilst maintaining or reducing costs. In multiple-track tape systems, as recorded track dimensions decrease, higher precision tape transport mechanisms and dedicated coding circuitry are required. This <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> <b>manufacturing</b> costs {{and a loss of}} flexibility. This thesis reports on the performance of a low precision low-cost multiple-track tape transport system. Software based techniques to study system performance, and to compensate for the mechanical deficiencies of this system were developed using occam and the transputer. The inherent parallelism of the multiple-track format was exploited by integrating a transputer into the recording channel to perform the signal processing tasks. An innovative model of the recording channel, written exclusively in occam, was developed. The effect of parameters, such as data rate, track dimensions and head misregistration on system performance was determined from the detailed error profile produced. This model may be run on a network of transputers, allowing its speed of execution to be scaled to suit the investigation. These features, combined with its modular flexibility makes it a powerful tool that may be applied to other multiple-track systems, such as digital HDTV. A greater understanding of the effects of mechanical deficiencies on the performance of multiple-track systems was gained from this study. This {{led to the development of}} a software based compensation scheme to reduce the effects of Lateral Head Displacement and allow low-cost tape transport mechanisms to be used with narrow, closely spaced tracks, facilitating higher packing densities. The experimental and simulated investigation of system performance, the development of the model and compensation scheme using parallel processing techniques has led to the publication of a paper and two further publications are expected.

40|$|AbstractIn the globalized and {{interconnected}} market, demand fluctuation {{along with}} the requirements of high product quality, low cost, short lead time and high customization may <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> an <b>increase</b> in <b>manufacturing</b> complexity. Over the past years, several methods, following different theories and approaches, have been proposed to analyse the manufacturing complexity. In this paper, the concepts of a manufacturing system's complexity are discussed. This study is a systematic and rigorous attempt to identify and synthesize the research done in the manufacturing systems’ complexity domain. Special emphasis is given to the approaches based on a theoretical analytical framework that provide a quantitative analysis of manufacturing systems complexity. These approaches and their applications to industrial problems are presented, classified, and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Current {{works on}} {{process-oriented}} tolerancing for multi-station manufacturing processes (MMPs) have been mainly focused on allocating fixture tolerances to ensure part quality specifications {{at a minimum}} manufacturing cost. Some works have also included fixture maintenance policies into the tolerance allocation problem since they are related to both manufacturing cost and final part qual- ity. However, {{there is a lack}} of incorporation of other factors that <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> of <b>manufacturing</b> cost and degrade of product quality, such as cutting-tool wear and machine-tool thermal state. The allocation of the admissible values of these process variables may be critical due to their impact on cutting-tool replacement and quality loss costs. In this paper, the process-oriented tolerancing is ex- panded based on the recently developed, extended stream of variation (SoV) model, which explicitly represents the influence of machining process variables in the variation propagation along MMPs. In addition, the probability distribution functions (pdf) for some machining process variables are ana- lyzed, and a procedure to derive part quality constraints according to GD&T specifications is also shown. With this modeling capability extension, a complete process-oriented tolerancing can be con- ducted, reaching a real minimum manufacturing cost. In order to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed methodology over a conventional method, a case study is analyzed in detail...|$|R
40|$|Application {{of solar}} {{collectors}} for hot water supply, space heating, and cooling plays {{a significant role}} in reducing building energy consumption. For conventional solar collectors, solar radiation is absorbed by spectral selective coating on the collectors’ tube/plate wall. The poor durability of the coating can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> an <b>increased</b> <b>manufacturing</b> cost and unreliability for a solar collector operated at a higher temperature. Therefore, a novel nanofluid-based direct absorption solar collector (NDASC) employing uncoated collector tubes has been proposed, and its operating characteristics for medium-temperature solar collection were theoretically and experimentally studied in this paper. CuO/oil nanofluid was prepared and used as working fluid of the NDASC. The heat-transfer mechanism of the NDASC with parabolic trough concentrator was theoretically evaluated and compared with a conventional indirect absorption solar collector (IASC). The theoretical analysis results suggested that the fluid’s temperature distribution in the NDASC was much more uniform than that in the IASC, and an enhanced collection efficiency could be achieved for the NDASC operated within a preferred working temperature range. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed NDASC, experimental performances of an NDASC and an IASC with the same parabolic trough concentrator were furthermore evaluated and comparatively discussed.

40|$|Abstract — 3 D Integrated Circuits (ICs) {{have been}} {{recently}} proposed {{as a solution}} <b>to</b> the <b>increasing</b> wire delay concerns in scaled technologies. At the same time, technology scaling <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> variability in <b>manufacturing</b> process parameters, making it imperative to quantify {{the impact of these}} variations on performance. In this work, we take, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the first step towards formally modeling the impact of process variations on the clock frequency of fully-synchronous (FS) 3 D ICs. The proposed analytical models demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that 3 D designs behave very differently under the impact of process variations as compared to equivalent 2 D designs. In particular, for the same number of critical paths, we show that a 3 D design is always less likely to meet a pre-defined frequency target compared to its 2 D counterpart. Furthermore, as opposed to models for 2 D ICs, the 3 D models need to accurately account for not only within-die (WID) critical paths, i. e., paths that lie entirely within one of the die layers, but also D 2 D critical paths that use throughsilicon vias (TSVs) to span across multiple dies in the 3 D stack. Finally, we show, theoretically and experimentally, that the mapping of critical paths to the die layers of a 3 D IC can also affect the timing yield of a design, while the mapping issue does not arise in the 2 D case since there is only a single die layer in a 2 D IC. The accuracy of the proposed models is experimentally verified and found to be in excellent agreement with detailed SPICE and gate-leve...|$|R
