From 18 January 1932 he attended the Staff College at Andover, and from 17 January 1933 he served on the Air Staff at the Headquarters of Iraq Command.

Shells continued to land at 15 minute intervals, with 21 counted on the first day. The initial assumption was these were bombs dropped from an airplane or Zeppelin flying too high to be seen or heard.

By the end of the day, military authorities were aware the shells were being fired from behind German lines by a new <b>long-range</b> <b>gun,</b> although there was initially wild press speculation on the origin of the shells. This included the theory they were being fired by German agents close by Paris, or even within the city itself, so abandoned quarries close to the city were searched for a hidden gun. However, the actual gun was found within days by the French air reconnaissance aviator Didier Daurat.|$|E
25|$|Organised by a seven-man Military Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the Rising {{began on}} Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, and lasted for six days. Members of the Irish Volunteers—led by {{schoolmaster}} and Irish language activist Patrick Pearse, {{joined by the}} smaller Irish Citizen Army of James Connolly and 200 women of Cumann na mBan—seized key locations in Dublin and proclaimed an Irish Republic. The British Army brought in thousands of reinforcements as well as artillery and a gunboat. There was fierce street fighting on the routes into the city centre, where the rebels put up stiff resistance, slowing the British advance and inflicting heavy casualties. Elsewhere in Dublin, the fighting mainly consisted of sniping and <b>long-range</b> <b>gun</b> battles. The main rebel positions were gradually surrounded and bombarded with artillery. There were isolated actions {{in other parts of}} Ireland, with attacks on the Royal Irish Constabulary barracks at Ashbourne, County Meath, County Cork and in County Galway, and the seizure of the town of Enniscorthy, County Wexford. Germany had sent a shipment of arms to the rebels, but the British had intercepted it just before the Rising began. Volunteer leader Eoin MacNeill had then issued a countermand in a bid to halt the Rising, which greatly reduced the number of rebels who mobilised.|$|E
