40|$|When juveniles must {{tolerate}} {{harsh environments}} early in life, the disproportionate success of certain phenotypes across multiple early life stages will dramatically influence adult community composition and dynamics. In many species, large offspring {{have a higher}} tolerance for stressful environments than do smaller conspecifics (parental effects). However, we have a poor understanding of whether the benefits of increased parental investment carry over after juveniles escape harsh environments or progress to later life stages (<b>latent</b> <b>effects).</b> To investigate whether parental <b>effects</b> and <b>latent</b> <b>effects</b> interactively influence offspring success, we determined {{the degree to which}} <b>latent</b> <b>effects</b> of harsh abiotic conditions are mediated by offspring size in two stony coral species. Larvae of both species were sorted by size class and exposed to relatively high-temperature or low-salinity conditions. Survivorship was quantified for six days in these stressful environments, after which surviving larvae were placed in ambient conditions and evaluated for their ability to settle and metamorphose. We subsequently assessed long-term post-settlement survival of one species in its natural environment. Following existing theory, we expected that, within and between species, larger offspring would have a higher tolerance for harsh environmental conditions than smaller offspring. We found that large size did enhance offspring performance in each species. However, large offspring size within a species did not reduce the proportional, negative <b>latent</b> <b>effects</b> of harsh larval environments. Furthermore, the coral species that produces larger offspring was more, not less, prone to negative <b>latent</b> <b>effects.</b> We conclude that, within species, large offspring size does not increase resistance to <b>latent</b> <b>effects.</b> Comparing between species, we conclude that larger offspring size does not inherently confer greater robustness, and we instead propose that other life history characteristics such as larval duration better predict the tolerance of offspring to harsh and variable abiotic conditions. Additionally, when considering how stressful environments influence offspring performance, studies that only evaluate direct effects may miss crucial downstream (<b>latent)</b> <b>effects</b> on juveniles that have significant consequences for long-term population dynamics...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the <b>latent</b> <b>effects</b> of larval food limitation {{on the performance of}} juvenile Crepidula onyx under both laboratory and field conditions, and the possible mechanisms through which these <b>latent</b> <b>effects</b> were mediated. Larvae were reared at either high or low food concentrations before they were induced to metamorphose. Feeding larvae at a low food concentration reduced the size, total organic content and energy reserves of newly metamorphosed juveniles. Juvenile growth (measured as increases in shell length and total organic carbon content) and survival were then followed for 3 to 17 d. Under both laboratory and field conditions, we found that growth was compromised for the juveniles that developed from larvae fed at the low food concentration. However, feeding larvae at the low food concentration reduced juvenile survival only under laboratory conditions, not in the field. Thus, juvenile habitat conditions seem to have altered the <b>latent</b> <b>effects</b> of larval food limitation on juvenile survival. Our results also suggest that the filtration rate of juveniles developed from larvae fed at the low food concentration was significantly reduced. Follow-up experiments showed that the larval food concentration did not affect carbon assimilation efficiency of juveniles, and that the <b>latent</b> <b>effects</b> of limited larval food conditions did not simply reflect the consequence of reduced energy reserves or size at metamorphosis. Poor food-collecting performance of juveniles was at least partially responsible for the observed <b>latent</b> <b>effects</b> of larval food limitation on juvenile growth. © Inter-Research 2007. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

A series of formal Bayesian model comparisons provides support for a model based on technological proximity combined with spatial proximity, asymmetric knowledge spillovers, and heterogeneity in the disturbances.

This study assessed {{the influence of}} early and later life social conditions on tooth loss and oral impacts on daily performances (OIDP) of people aged 65 and 70 years. Whether social inequalities in oral health changed after the usual age of retirement was also examined. In accordance with "the <b>latent</b> <b>effect</b> life course model", {{it was hypothesized that}} adverse early-life social conditions increase the risk of subsequent tooth loss and impaired OIDP, independent of later-life social conditions. Methods: Data were obtained from two cohorts studies conducted in Sweden and Norway. The 2007 and 2012 waves of the surveys were used for the present study. Early-life social conditions were measured in terms of gender, education and country of birth, and later-life social conditions were assessed by working status, marital status and size of social network. Logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used to analyse the data. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to adjust estimates for missing responses and loss to follow-up. Results: Early-life social conditions contributed to tooth loss and OIDP in each survey year and both countries independent of later-life social conditions. Lower education correlated positively with tooth loss, but did not influence OIDP. Foreign country of birth correlated positively with oral impacts in Sweden only. Later-life social conditions were the strongest predictors of tooth loss and OIDP across survey years and countries. GEE revealed significant interactions between social network and survey year, and between marital status and survey year on tooth loss.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the concept that}} morphine has latent deleterious actions on the ventilatory control systems that respond to a hypoxic-hypercapnic challenge. In this study, we examined the ventilatory responses elicited by hypoxic-hypercapnic challenge in conscious rats {{at a time when}} the effects of morphine (10 mg/kg) on arterial blood-gas chemistry and minute ventilation had subsided. Morphine induced pronounced changes in arterial blood-gas chemistry (e. g., an increase in pCO 2, decreases in pO 2 and sO 2) and decreases in minute ventilation. Despite the complete resolution of the morphine-induced changes in arterial blood-gas chemistry and minute ventilation and almost complete resolution of the effects on peak inspiratory flow and peak expiratory flow, subsequent exposure to hypoxic-hypercapnic challenge elicited markedly blunted increases in minute ventilation and in peak inspiratory and expiratory flows. These find ings demonstrate that 1) the changes in arterial blood-gas chemistry elicited by morphine parallel changes in minute ventilation rather than PIF and PEF, and 2) morphine has <b>latent</b> untoward <b>effects</b> on the ventila tory responses to hypoxic-hypercapnic challenge.
