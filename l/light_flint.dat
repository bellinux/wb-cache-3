40|$|The {{potential}} for iron(III) tartrate {{to act as}} a photoactivator in light-induced oxidative degradation of white wine is described. Using a tartaric-acid-based model wine system containing 5 mg/L iron, exposure to light from a xenon arc lamp led to the oxidative degradation of tartaric acid and the production of glyoxylic acid. The critical wavelength of light for the degradation process was found to be below 520 nm. No glyoxylic acid was formed in the absence of iron and/or <b>light.</b> <b>Flint</b> glass offered little protection from the light-induced photodegradation of tartaric acid. Antique Green glass offered more protection but did not stop the photodegradation process...|$|E
40|$|French {{tarragon}} {{is included}} within the brochure of herbs that Colombia is offering to export. Although renewal is recommended {{every three or}} four years, in Colombia there are crops more than eight years of age and with low yield because its traditional vegetative propagation is difficult, therefore it is necessary to establish alternative propagation methods to improve its yield. In order to analyze the phyllochron and growth between French tarragon plants with different origin of propagation (micropropagation and traditional propagation), parameters to simulate field behavior from a model was estimated. From cardinal temperatures, a quadratic function of tarragon’s phyllocron, whose rate was higher in plants from micropropagation during establishment, was determined. The general meristematic activity in plants of in vitro treatment shown to be greater than plants of field treatment, as well as leaf area index (LAI), fraction of intercepted <b>light</b> (<b>FLINT)</b> extinction coefficient (K) and radiation use efficiency (RUE), which involved differences in the architecture of plants in both treatments. Distribution of biomass to leaves and stems was similar in both treatments. This is the first study using a deterministic model to analyze the effect of micropropagation in field tarragon’s growth...|$|E

50|$|Flint revives and sneaks {{into the}} Galaxy complex, but his {{infiltration}} is thwarted {{and he is}} taken before Galaxy's trio of leaders. Offered a chance to join their new order, he refuses, and is sentenced to death by disintegration. Gila's failure to eliminate Flint results in her being stripped of her leadership role and reassigned to become a Pleasure Unit - a fate which has already befallen Flint's playmates. She thus changes sides, slipping Flint his gadget-filled cigarette lighter before she is hauled away. With {{the help of the}} <b>lighter,</b> <b>Flint</b> again escapes, sabotages the machinery, rescues his playmates and Gila, and departs the island as it disintegrates. Flint and the women are picked up by a waiting American warship, as they watch a volcano erupts on the island.|$|R

500|$|The {{first use}} of cerium was in gas mantles, invented by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach. In 1885, he had {{previously}} experimented with mixtures of magnesium, lanthanum, and yttrium oxides, but these gave green-tinted light and were unsuccessful. Six years later, he discovered that pure thorium oxide produced a much better, though blue, light, and that mixing it with cerium dioxide resulted in a bright white light. Additionally, cerium dioxide also acts {{as a catalyst for}} the combustion of thorium oxide. This resulted in great commercial success for von Welsbach and his invention, and created great demand for thorium; its production resulted in a large amount of lanthanides being simultaneously extracted as by-products. Applications were soon found for them, especially in the pyrophoric alloy known as [...] "mischmetall" [...] composed of 50% cerium, 25% lanthanum, and the remainder being the other lanthanides, that is used widely for <b>lighter</b> <b>flints.</b> Usually, iron is also added to form an alloy known as ferrocerium, also invented by von Welsbach. Due to the chemical similarities of the lanthanides, chemical separation is not usually required for their applications, such as the mixing of mischmetall into steel to improve its strength and workability, or as catalysts for the cracking of petroleum. This property of cerium saved the life of writer Primo Levi at the Auschwitz concentration camp, when he found a supply of ferrocerium alloy and bartered it for food.|$|R
60|$|The tangled thicket and {{the long}} slant of dust and little chips of {{weathered}} rock and the steep bench of stone and the worn steps all were arduous work for Bess in the climbing. But she gained the shelf, gasping, hot of cheek, glad of eye, with her hand in Venters's. Here they rested. The beautiful valley glittered below with its millions of wind-turned leaves bright-faced in the sun, and the mighty bridge towered heavenward, crowned with blue sky. Bess, however, never rested for long. Soon she was exploring, and Venters followed; she dragged forth from corners and shelves a multitude of crudely fashioned and painted pieces of pottery, and he carried them. They peeped down into the dark holes of the kivas, and Bess gleefully dropped a stone {{and waited for the}} long-coming hollow sound to rise. They peeped into the little globular houses, like mud-wasp nests, and wondered if these had been store-places for grain, or baby cribs, or what; and they crawled into the larger houses and laughed when they bumped their heads on the low roofs, and they dug in the dust of the floors. And they brought from dust and darkness armloads of treasure which they carried to the <b>light.</b> <b>Flints</b> and stones and strange curved sticks and pottery they found; and twisted grass rope that crumbled in their hands, and bits of whitish stone which crushed to powder at a touch and seemed to vanish in the air.|$|R

(2011), who also found increasing colonization rates with increasing quartz rock size. In contrast, Berner and Evenari (1978) reported larger mean stone thickness values for uncolonized <b>light</b> and dark <b>flint</b> stones (16 – 20 mm) as compared to colonized ones (11 – 15 mm).|$|R

50|$|By {{the year}} 1910 he {{received}} his first patent for a pocket lighter (U.S. Pat. 965,149). His pocket <b>lighter</b> used <b>flint</b> material which contained a mixture of cerium and iron according to the patent. His design was a simple device that created a shower of sparks with the press of a finger - {{but there was no}} sustainable flame. Based on the patent dates, this device preceded the Pist-O-Liter (U.S. Pat. 966,153) which he successfully produced that year, but likewise, it only produced sparks. Within three years he received a patent titled Pyrophorous Lighter, (U.S. Pat. 1,084,386) which we now appreciate as the Paragon striker lighter, a simple device capable of producing and sustaining a flame by means of a steel-tipped wand fitted with a cloth-wick saturated in petroleum ether also known as Benzine or Naphtha. The following year, 1914, he was granted a design patent for the well known Bulldog striker lighter (Des. Pat. D 45,407) which utilized the same principles as the Paragon, and soon became a very popular table lighter.|$|R

60|$|After a {{time the}} track {{led me to a}} {{slightly}} open space where the light was better. I thought that objects seemed familiar to me as I looked round. Advancing, I came on a spot where the snow was much trodden down. There was a bank of snow near. I went towards it while a terrible suspicion flashed into my mind. Yes, it was the very spot on which I had been sitting hours before, while I was making fruitless efforts to obtain a <b>light</b> from the <b>flint</b> of my gun! I had been doing that of which I had often read and heard, walking unwittingly in a circle, and had actually come back to the spot from which I set out.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{he opened the}} fire-bag which Adolay had given him and took out of it the clay pipe, tobacco, and {{materials}} for producing fire. The medicine-man was instantly forgotten, and the mouths {{as well as the}} eyes of the whole assembly opened in unspeakable wonder as Cheenbuk went through the complex processes of filling and lighting the pipe. First he cut up some of the Canada twist, which, he explained, was the tubuk of the white men. Then having filled the pipe, he proceeded to strike a <b>light</b> with <b>flint</b> and steel. In this he was not very successful at first, not yet having had much practice. He chipped his knuckles a good deal, and more than once knocked the flint and tinder out of his fingers. But his audience was not critical. They regarded this as part of the performance. When, however, he at last struck a succession of sparks, he also struck an equal number of short, sharp expressions of astonishment out of his friends, and when the tinder caught there was a suppressed grunt of surprise and pleasure; but when he put the fire into the pipe and began to smoke, there burst forth a prolonged shout of laughter. To see a man smoking like a bad lamp was a joke that seemed to tickle those unsophisticated children of the ice immensely.|$|R
60|$|There was but {{one course}} open. As the fire drew near the Indian stopped, dismounted, and tore up and beat down {{a portion of}} the grass around him. Then he struck a <b>light</b> with <b>flint</b> and steel and set fire to the grass to leeward of the cleared space. It burned slowly at first, and he looked anxiously back as the roar of the fiery storm swelled upon his ear. Tony looked on in mute alarm and surprise. The horse raised its head wildly and became restive, but the Indian, having now lighted the long grass thoroughly, {{restrained}} it. Presently he sprang on its back and drew Tony up beside him. Flames and smoke were now on both sides of him. When the grass was consumed to leeward he rode on to the blackened space--not a moment too soon, however. It was barely large enough to serve as a spot of refuge when the storm rolled down and almost suffocated horse and riders with smoke. Then the fire at that spot went out for want of fuel, and thus the way was opened to the coal-black plain over which it had swept. Away flew the Indian then, diverging sharply to the right, so as to skirt the fire, (now on its windward side), and riding frequently into the very fringe of flame, so that his footprints might be burnt up.|$|R
6000|$|The Arab {{was an old}} hunter, and he now asked Malchus to {{take his}} place with the bow while he drove the bear out. He first took off his bernous, cut off several strips from the bottom, knotted them together, and then twisted the strip into a rope. Growing out from a crevice in the rock, some three feet above the top of the cave, was a young tree; and round this, close to the root, Nessus {{fastened}} one end of his rope, the other he formed into a slip-knot and let the noose fall in front of the cave, keeping it open with two twigs placed across it. Then he gathered some brushwood and placed it at the entrance, put a bunch of dried twigs and dead leaves among it, and, striking a <b>light</b> with his <b>flint</b> and steel on some dried fungus, placed this {{in the middle of the}} sticks and blew upon it. In a minute a flame leaped up. [...] "Now, my lord," [...] he said, [...] "be ready with your sword and spear. The beast will be out in a minute; she cannot stand the smoke." ...|$|R
60|$|Under the willow-tree, Frank and La Roche busied {{themselves}} in spreading {{a very small}} white tent for Mr Stanley and his family. Frank himself, although entitled from his position in the Company's service to the luxury of a tent, scorned to use one, preferring to rough it like the men, and sleep beneath {{the shelter of the}} small canoe. Meanwhile, Mr Stanley proceeded to strike a <b>light</b> with his <b>flint</b> and steel; and Bryan, having deposited his burden near the tent, soon collected a sufficiency of driftwood to make a good fire. Edith and her mother were not idle {{in the midst of this}} busy scene. They collected a few bundles of dried twigs to make the fire light more easily, and after the blaze was casting its broad glare of light over the camp, and the tent was pitched, they assisted La Roche in laying the cloth for supper. Of course, in a journey like this, none but necessary articles were taken, and these were of the most homely character. The kettle was the tea-pot, the cups were tin pannikins, and the table-cloth was a large towel, while the table itself was the ground, from the damp of which, however, the party in the tent were protected by an ample oil-cloth.|$|R
6000|$|Flints.--If we may {{rely on a}} {{well-known}} passage in Virgil, concerning Æneas and his comrades, fire was sometimes made in ancient days by striking together two flints, but I confess myself wholly unable to <b>light</b> tinder with <b>flints</b> alone, and I am equally {{at a loss to}} understand what were the [...] "dry leaves" [...] that they are said in the same passage to have used for tinder. Neither can I obtain fire except with a flint and steel, or, at least, hardened iron; a flint and ordinary iron will not give an available spark. Flints may be replaced by any siliceous stone, as agate, rock-crystal, or quartz. Agate is preferred to flint, for it gives a hotter spark: it is sold by tobacconists. A partly siliceous stone, such as granite, will answer in default of one that is wholly siliceous. I have been surprised at finding that crockery and porcelain of all kinds will make a spark, and sometimes a very good one. There are cases where a broken teacup might be the salvation of many lives in a shipwrecked party. On coral-reefs, and other coasts destitute of flinty stones, search should be made for drift-wood and drifted sea-weed. In the roots of these, the pebbles of other shores are not unfrequently entangled, and flint may be found among them. The joints of bamboos occasionally contain enough silex to give a spark.|$|R
