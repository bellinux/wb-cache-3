5|$|The players {{ultimately}} prevailed after a {{jury trial}} on their claims. That verdict, the pendency of other antitrust cases {{and the threat of}} a class action <b>lawsuit</b> <b>filed</b> <b>by</b> Reggie White, then with the Philadelphia Eagles, on behalf of all NFL players caused the parties to settle the antitrust cases and to agree on a formula that permitted free agency. In return, the owners received a salary cap, albeit one tied to a formula based on the players' share of total league revenues. The agreement also established a salary floorminimum payrolls all teams were obliged to pay. The settlement was presented to and approved by Judge Doty, who had also heard the McNeil antitrust case in 1993. Once the agreement was approved, the NFLPA reconstituted itself as a labor union and entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the league. The NFLPA and the league extended the 1993 agreement five times. The final extension came in March 2006 when it was extended through the 2010 season after the NFL owners voted 302 to accept the NFLPA's final proposal.|$|E

5000|$|The Prison Litigation Reform Act made it {{much more}} {{difficult}} for prisoners to file class action and individual lawsuits against a prison.

[...] PRLA also includes a cap on attorney fees, which has made fewer attorneys willing to represent prisoners. [...] Although PRLA applies to all <b>lawsuits</b> <b>filed</b> <b>by</b> incarcerated people, it is particularly relevant for women's health because most <b>lawsuits</b> <b>filed</b> <b>by</b> incarcerated women concern substandard health care.|$|R
