5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1950s, {{the whole}} family seated around a set in the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> the typical way of {{listening}} to radio. Stations tried to {{be all things to}} all people, and specialised programming was not really thought about at this stage (it did not come in until the late 1950s). Because of this, programming on most stations was pretty much the same.|$|E

25|$|As {{with all}} of the episodes Jonathan Miller directed, he allowed the work of celebrated {{artisans}} to influence his design concepts. In the case of Shrew, the street set was {{based on the work of}} architect Sebastiano Serlio, as well as the Teatro Olimpico, designed by Andrea Palladio. Baptista's <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> modelled closely on Johannes Vermeer's The Music Lesson.|$|E
25|$|In a rural {{home the}} <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> {{enlarged}} so the weaver {{could benefit from}} heat from the single hearth. To provide enough light to operate a loom, a long window of up to ten lights occupied one wall. Alternatively, an extra storey was added so that manufacture was separated from family life. The loom shop was marked by the long multi-light mullioned window that became common in urban settings. Three-storey terraced cottages are now referred to as Weavers' cottages.|$|E
25|$|Leonardo da Vinci invented an {{automated}} {{system for a}} rotating spit for spit-roasting: a propeller in the chimney made the spit turn all by itself. This kind of system was widely used in wealthier homes. Beginning in the late Middle Ages, kitchens in Europe lost their home-heating function even more and were increasingly moved from the living area into a separate room. The <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> now heated by tiled stoves, operated from the kitchen, which offered the huge advantage of not filling the room with smoke.|$|E
40|$|Adjacencies in {{architecture}} are those {{relationships between the}} various parts of building that are critical to its success. For example, the <b>living</b> and dining <b>rooms</b> in typical home design have {{a high degree of}} adjacency. The rooms support each other and, frequently, the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> the space to which the dining <b>room</b> <b>is</b> adjacent. In other words, the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> the central space that the dining <b>room</b> should <b>be</b> near so that both spaces may function in a positive way...|$|R

25|$|The urban {{middle class}} imitated the luxurious dining {{styles of the}} upper class as best as they could. Living in smaller apartments, the kitchen was the main room—here, the family lived. The study or <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> saved for special {{occasions}} such as an occasional dinner invitation. Because of this, these middle-class kitchens were often more homely {{than those of the}} upper class, where the kitchen was a work-only room occupied only by the servants. Besides a cupboard to store the kitchenware, there were a table and chairs, where the family would dine, and sometimes—if space allowed—even a fauteuil or a couch.|$|E

In the earliest seasons of the show, the brothers' shared bedroom was {{the only part of}} the manor shown, but in later years, their kitchen was also used. This remained largely the case during the follow-up series The Podge and Rodge Show, although the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> featured in the Bogmannay special on New Year's Eve 2006. The underground dungeon of Ballydung Manor was also shown in an episode of the chatshow when Podge and Rodge invited guest Sheana Keane to partake in a gruesome game of Operation!.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{of the house was}} much smaller than the year before. The <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> brought back inside the house, with two glass doors separating it from the main floor area. On Launch Night, McCall said the room will change colour depending on what mood the housemates were in, however the walls only changed colour on eviction nights. The bedroom was across from the living room, and featured a waterbed, the bathroom was accessed through the bedroom, and featured a bath, shower and also a toilet. The kitchen was small and beside the door leading to the garden. In the garden, which was much larger than the house, was a barbecue, a pool, a seating area and a bridge titled The Bridge to Nowhere which led to another seating area. The interior stairs remained closed off once again, and had a yellow and black theme.|$|E

500|$|The Ellwood House {{living room}} {{did not exist}} until Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. The {{original}} living room space was laid out as two rooms with pocket doors joining them. In the living room, a wall between the sitting room was removed which created a large, open space to which a vaulted ceiling was added. Perry Ellwood's <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> designed to function with the newly added sunroom and south terrace as one large living and entertaining space. The terrace can be accessed through French doors from both {{the living room and}} sunroom. The <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> designed to reflect English country houses c. 1650, during the Stuart period. The room was designed by Roy Terwilliger, an interior designer with Marshall Field & Company in Chicago and May Ellwood's cousin. The living room features a [...] "pargework" [...] ceiling constructed of molded plaster and designed with a geometric theme. The large, Caen stone [...] fireplace was carved in Chicago in 1911. The sunroom was designed in the late 19th century and early 20th century Arts and Crafts style causing it to stand {{in stark contrast to the}} living room. The room was originally furnished with Mission style furniture to complement the oak woodwork.|$|E

The play that Bart and Homer are rehearsing in the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> written by American playwright Edward Albee. Near {{the end of the}} episode, Homer gains strength by drinking a can of beer. The scene parodies the character Popeye, who gained super-strength from eating spinach. Homer also talks {{in a manner similar to}} Popeye after drinking the beer. Marge also resembles Popeye's love interest Olive Oyl in the scene.|$|E

Patrons of the latter café have access to a rooftop patio area as well as the [...] "Halifax Living Room" [...] housed in the cantilevered portion of the building overlooking Spring Garden Road. The <b>Living</b> <b>Room</b> <b>was</b> designed as an airy, indoor public space with views of both Citadel Hill and Halifax Harbour as well as the civic square below. The ground floor café, {{in the corner of the}} building nearest the intersection, opens earlier than the rest of the library. The concession to operate from both spaces was won by Pavia Gallery Espresso Bar and Café of Herring Cove, who beat out Second Cup and Uncommon Grounds. Pavia holds a ten-year contract with an option for an additional seven years.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{took place}} in Los Angeles, California, which doubled for scenes set in a 1950s-era New York City. The Palladium Ballroom, a former New York City concert hall, was recreated {{to serve as a}} centrepiece in the film. [...] In {{describing}} the look of the film, production designer Stuart Wurtzel stated, [...] "There are lots of photographs and some film from that period. ... There's a film called Mambo Madness from 1955 with some footage of Tito Puente and Desi Arnaz we looked at, and we got pictures from the Cuban Society in New York and from libraries. The Cuban community has been enormously supportive of the film, so we've also been privy to the private archives of many people." [...] Ann Roth served as the film's costume designer, using vintage textiles to create the custom-made wardrobe. [...] The I Love Lucy segment of the film was filmed at Ren-Mar Studios, the former site of Desilu Productions. The set of the Ricardos' <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> re-created, with film editors intercutting footage with Banderas, Assante and Arnaz, Jr. with an actual episode featuring Lucille Ball." ...|$|E

2500|$|Recording Brian Lane's drums was {{approached}} song-by-song, {{as opposed to}} recording all of the albums drums in succession. This allowed Lane to experiment recording drums in different ways and places, predominately around Sapone's home. Lane commented that Sapone's <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the main}} places they worked on the drums. The band's touring percussionist Ben Homala also contributed parts to the recording sessions, while Mike Sapone jr. and Santino Sapone acted as drum technicians. Claudius Mittendorfer, who assisted with the recording of The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me acted as an advisor during the sessions, while Michael Lapierre assisted the recording of [...] "Be Gone", [...] "Sink" [...] and [...] "Daisy".

2500|$|In 2001, {{the house}} was {{purchased}} by Robert Niosi, Sally Lee, and their family, and Niosi undertook a major renovation of the home: he expanded the kitchen and changed {{the door to the}} servants' quarters into a bookshelf. He also renovated the master bedroom upstairs but left the circular windows alone, expanding the front door window to let more light into the front hallway, and he copper-paneled the front Dutch-style door. In addition, the outdated boiler system was replaced, and the entrance to the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> widened. Niosi left the exterior relatively unchanged, but he said that when he bought the house, it was very [...] "austere" [...] inside—the walls were simple white or beige in color, with no ornamentation; the only decoration was on the unique Harrison-designed spiral staircase to the second floor, which had brass bamboo supports that Niosi left alone; he stated that the staircase had been built in Japan and exported in one piece. Niosi had previously lived in a Victorian apartment, decorated both inside and out, so when he moved to this Harrison-designed house, it was initially cold and unwelcoming with its simplicity and lack of decoration. To address this, Niosi added more traditional 1930s Mackintosh Arts and Crafts interior wood paneling and William Morris wallpaper in order to decorate and soften the interior of the house and make it more warm and inviting. This redecoration gave this residence a unique combination of a conventional 1930s Arts and Crafts interior design with an unconventional early Modernist exterior. He also had many walls and doors removed that were deemed unnecessary, and raised ceilings and added windows. The house's kitchen, with an adjoining maid's room and bathroom, was replaced with a modern kitchen. The <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> split to include a home theater and the wet bar was replaced to accommodate a film collection. After the remodel, parts of the house were featured in Ladies' Home Journal and Parents.|$|E
