40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the development of}} a new framework to control traffic signal lights for a road network with a recently introduced bus rapid transit (BRT) system. By applying automated goal-directed learning and decision-making called reinforcement learning, the best possible traffic signal actions can be sought upon changes of network states as modelled by the signalized cell transmission model (CTM). An extension to a network of cascading interactions with a BRT system has been proposed with simple uni-directional flows without turning movements. Motivated by the BRT system in Thailand, the conventional signalized CTM has been generalized to cope with the preplanned space-usage priority of a BRT over other non-priority vehicles. A BRT physical <b>lane</b> <b>separator</b> as well as the location of BRT stations have been explicitly modelled. The delay function of both carried passengers on BRT and on other non-priority vehicles as well as waiting passengers at stations has been introduced. The deployment of BRT system with one lane deducted by the <b>lane</b> <b>separator</b> cannot reduce the total passenger delay in comparison with the same road and traffic condition before the installation of the BRT system. Moreover, our proposed method outperforms preemptive and differential priority control methods because of the improved awareness of the signal switching cost...|$|E

There is widespread acknowledgement (supported by a substantial body of research) that providing increased physical separation between motor vehicle and bicycle space will help address these concerns and {{lead to an increase}} in cycling. A wide variety of physical devices and delineators are available to provide separation. This research covers on-road trials of a 100 mm wide raised bicycle <b>lane</b> <b>separator</b> in Christchurch. ViaStrada was commissioned by VicRoads to design the empirical study, and evaluate and report on the findings. Christchurch City Council provided site support and Canterbury University helped to analyse the results. Separators were placed in two locations where motorists were commonly encroaching into exclusive bicycle lanes. Road user behaviour was observed before and after installation, and qualitative feedback was also sought from site users. The results show a significant effect on motor vehicle encroachments following installation, particularly when separators were supplemented by vertical posts. Very positive feedback was also received from existing cyclists. Some recommendations for best practice guidance on the most appropriate treatment locations and layouts are also suggested...|$|E

40|$|Semarang - Kendal Road {{section is}} a {{connector}} between {{the central city}} of Semarang and Kendal. Traffic flows and accident rates through this street is quite high, especially accidents involving motorcycles. For that, the solution is the implementation of motorcycle lanes. From the analysis results DS in Siliwangi Road Sections is 0, 75 and 0, 78 in Walisongo Roads with low average speed is 27, 58 km /h in Jalan Siliwangi. Analysis results obtained Siliwangi Road motorcycle accident is 70 % and 66 % on Walisongo Road. The proportion of motorcycle on Siliwangi road is 25. 25 % - 41. 66 % and 18. 86 % - 41. 43 % on Walisongo Road. Volume motorcycle in Siliwangi Road 1, 687 pcu/hour and Walisongo Road 1, 231 pcu/hour. Siliwangi Road DS is 0. 75 and 0. 78 on Walisongo Road. From solutions then selected by the best alternative with DS. Siliwangi road is divided into 4 segments, Segment I {{is to make the}} motorcycle lane with a width of 4 m and the other vehicle lane with a width of 8 m. Segment II is to make the motorcycle lane with a width of 4, 25 m and the other vehicle lane with a width of 9, 75 m. Segment III, this does not allow the roads to be made motorcycle lane because the road has a length of less than 100 m. Segment IV is to make the motorcycle lane with a width of 4 m and the other vehicle lane with a width of 7 m. In the Walisongo roads solution is to makes the motorcycle lane with a width of 4 m, and the other vehicle lane with a width of 7 m. Based on those motorcycle lanes parameters, can be concluded that the Semarang - Kendal Road section required motorcycle <b>lanes</b> with <b>lane</b> <b>separators</b> are markers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTurbo-roundabouts {{represent}} an innovative scheme of modern roundabouts {{which provides a}} spiraling traffic flow and requires drivers to choose their direction before entering the intersection, since raised <b>lane</b> <b>separators</b> mark the <b>lanes</b> on the ring. The configuration of the turbo-roundabout makes that patterns of conflict at entries with one and two conflicting traffic streams can coexist. This paper presents research efforts aimed at measuring quantitatively the effect of heavy vehicles on operational conditions of a turbo-roundabout. The study starts from the initial belief that the greatest constraints to the vehicular trajectories imposed by the turbo-roundabout necessarily imply {{that the impact of}} heavy vehicles on the quality of traffic flow is more unfavorable than on other modern roundabouts. Microsimulation revealed as a useful tool when the variation of the traffic quality in turbo-roundabouts should be evaluated in presence of mixed fleets, each having different percentages of heavy vehicles; indeed, it allowed to isolate traffic conditions difficult to observe on field and replicate them to have a number of data as much as possible numerous. Entry capacity values for each entry lane of the turbo-roundabout were obtained by microsimulation, varying the percentage of heavy vehicles for entering flows. Nonlinear regression analysis of simulation data allowed to derive the behavioral parameters for heterogeneous populations of users and, ultimately, composed exclusively of heavy vehicles. The capacity functions thus obtained allowed us to determine how the passenger car equivalent (PCE) varies with the percentage of heavy vehicles and circulating flows for each entry lane of the turbo-roundabout. The results {{of this study indicate that}} there is a need to distinguish the impact of heavy vehicles when analyzing the capacity of a turbo-roundabout. When the traffic stream contains a significant number of heavy vehicles, a larger PCE effect would be expected. This effect should be accounted for in the estimation of the turbo-roundabout capacity. Lastly it should be emphasized that an important aspect of the research consists in having identified a methodology for assessing the impact of heavy vehicles on the quality of traffic flow, that can be applied to different patterns of intersection...|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands, the Sustainable Safety {{vision is}} an {{important}} guide in improving road safety. It is considered that the road environment shouldconform to the expectations of road users {{in order to prevent}} errors thatcould lead to road crashes. These expectations are based on the characteristics of road types. The following types of roads are distinguished: access roads (30 or 60 km/h, vulnerable road users and agricultural vehicles possible, large amount of junctions), distributor roads (50 or 80 km/h, vulnerable road users separated from motorised traffic, no agricultural vehicles preferred, fewer junctions), and flow roads (100 / 120 km/h, no slow traffic, split-level junctions). Distinction of these road types and self-explaining characteristics are requirements for recognizable roads. To elaborate the predictability principle, 'essential recognition characteristics' (ERCs) have been defined. They consist of unique pattern of edge markings and <b>lane</b> <b>separators</b> per road type. Implementation of these ERCs has been started last years, especially on rural roads. Although there were good reasons for these ERCs to be specified, there was little knowledge about the effects on road user behaviour and road user expectations. To find out, SWOV examined these topics in a photo-categorisation study and a driving simulator study. In the first study, the distinctiveness and self-explaining characteristics of the different rural road types (15 photographs per roadtype) in various design options (ERC design and mix of ERC and traditional design) were investigated: The study showed that road users had most problems with distinguishing the distributor roads from the flow roads. Possible explanations for this finding were that these roads differ particularly on edge markings (in the ERC-condition), which is a characteristic road users pay insufficient attention to. The study also gave an indication of other road/environmental characteristics on which drivers pay attention byformulating expectations. The red cycle lanes along access roads appearedto be both distinguishable (access roads) and self-explaining (vulnerableroad users). In the second study, the effects of different design types (traditional design, ERC-design, ideal Sustainable Safety design) on road user behaviour (speed and lateral position) were examined. These behaviourswere examined in the light of general safety effects and a more specific hypothesis that underlies the predictability principle: does a recognizable road design lead to more homogeneous road user behaviour (and thus to more predictable and safer behaviour) ? The study showed that the road designitself has a strong effect on driving behaviour: more physical lane separation, for instance induced slower driving, and lateral position shifted towards the shoulder of the road. The study showed also an effect on more homogeneous lateral positions between vehicles, but not in speed. From bothstudies, it is concluded that the new road design with ERCs provides a good basis for the distinction of different road types and safer road behaviour. The distinctiveness may, however, be improved further by a higher level of uniformity of road design per road type. Safer behaviour may particularly be improved by examining more carefully the specific combination of road design elements of each road type. For the covering abstract see ITRDE 137145...|$|R
