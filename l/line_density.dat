An efficient {{method to}} obtain {{this type of}} beams is to extract a long pulse, high current beam from a gun at high energy, and let the beam pass through a decelerating field to compress it. The low energy beam-bunch is loaded into a solenoid and matched to a Brillouin flow.

50|$|In spacer patterning, {{a spacer}} {{is a film}} layer formed on the {{sidewall}} of a pre-patterned feature. A spacer is formed by deposition or reaction of the film on the previous pattern, followed by etching to remove all the film material on the horizontal surfaces, leaving only the material on the sidewalls. By removing the original patterned feature, only the spacer is left. However, since there are two spacers for every line, the <b>line</b> <b>density</b> has now doubled. This is {{commonly referred to as}} Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP). The spacer technique is applicable for defining narrow gates at half the original lithographic pitch, for example.As pitch splitting has become more difficult due to possible differences in feature positions between different exposed parts, sidewall image transfer (SIT) has become more recognized as the necessary approach. The SIT approach typically requires a spacer layer to be formed on an etched feature's sidewall. If this spacer corresponds to a conducting feature, then ultimately it must be cut at no less than two locations to separate the feature into two or more conducting lines as typically expected. On the other hand, if the spacer corresponds to a dielectric feature, cutting would not be necessary. The prediction of how many cuts would be needed for advanced logic patterns has been a large technical challenge. Many approaches for spacer patterning have been published (some listed below), all targeting the improved management (and reduction) of the cuts.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of hydrogen fibre Z-pinches {{to the study}} of the radiative collapse phenomenon is studied computationally. Two areas of difficulty, the formation of a fully ionized pinch from a cryogenic fibre and the processes leading to collapse termination, are addressed in detail. A zero-D model based on the energy equation highlights the importance of particle end losses and changes in the Coulomb logarithm upon collapse initiation and termination. A 1 -D Lagrangian resistive MHD code shows the importance of the changing radial profile shapes, particularly in delaying collapse termination. A 1 -D, three fluid MHD code is developed to model the ionization of the fibre by thermal conduction from a high temperature surface corona to the cold core. Rate equations for collisional ionization, 3 -body recombination and equilibration are solved in tandem with fluid equations for the electrons, ions and neutrals. Continuum lowering is found to assist ionization at the corona-core interface. The high density plasma phenomena responsible for radiative collapse termination are identified as the self-trapping of radiation and free electron degeneracy. A radiation transport model and computational analogues for the effects of degeneracy upon the equation of state, transport coefficients and opacity are implemented in the 1 -D, single fluid model. As opacity increases the emergent spectrum is observed to become increasingly Planckian and a fall off in radiative cooling at small radii and low frequencies occurs giving rise to collapse termination. Electron degeneracy terminates radiative collapse by supplementing the radial pressure gradient until the electromagnetic pinch force is balanced. Collapse termination is found to be a hybrid process of opacity and degeneracy effects across a wide range of <b>line</b> <b>densities</b> with opacity dominant at large <b>line</b> <b>densities</b> but with electron degeneracy becoming increasingly important at lower <b>line</b> <b>densities.</b> (author) Available from British Library Document Supply Centre-DSC:DX 205768 / BLDSC - British Library Document Supply CentreSIGLEGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{self-absorption}} {{technique is}} a simple method to determine the <b>line</b> integrated <b>density</b> of metastable atoms in low-pressure plasmas. In order to employ this technique, {{it is necessary to}} make an assumption on the spatial profiles of both the emission intensity and the absorbing species, which usually are unknown and can be highly nonuniform. Taking Ar*(1 s 5) atoms in a capacitively coupled plasma as an example, the influence of nonuniformity on the measurement of the <b>line</b> integrated <b>density</b> of the absorbing species is investigated analytically. It is proved that when the two spatial profiles are the same, the obtained <b>line</b> integrated <b>density</b> is independent of the functional form of this profile. This is also true if the density of the absorbing species is small (weak absorption), even though the emission profile is {{different from that of the}} absorbing species. However, if the density is high (strong absorption), the choice of the profiles has a significant influence on the deduced <b>line</b> integrated <b>density.</b> In the experiment, it is found that in argon-oxygen mixture discharges, in which Ar*(1 s 5) density is low (weak absorption), the measured densities by self-absorption are in very good agreement with the results obtained from laser absorption. However, in pure argon discharge, when the density is high (strong absorption), the measured densities by self-absorption are significantly smaller than that by laser absorption. Both phenomena have been predicted by the model results. The smaller densities obtained by self-absorption in the pure argon discharge are attributed to the assumption of the same spatial profile used in the model...|$|R
