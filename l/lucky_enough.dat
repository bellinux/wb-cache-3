5|$|Horowitz {{points out}} that the film's {{dichotomy}} of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust. Author Jason Epstein commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or <b>lucky</b> <b>enough,</b> they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E
5|$|E.T. is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control an alien (E.T.) from a top-down perspective. The objective {{of the game is}} to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). The player is provided with an on-screen energy bar, which decreases when E.T. performs any actions (including moving, teleporting, or falling into a pit, as well as levitating back to the top). To prevent this, E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces, which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece of the telephone, or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone, which allows him to call his home planet. When the call is made, E.T. must reach the spaceship in a given time limit. Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on screen and take him back to his home planet. Then the game starts over, with the same difficulty level, while changing the location of the telephone pieces. The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration. The game ends when the energy bar depletes. E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliot will come in and revive him. E.T. can get a fourth life if the player is <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> to find a geranium in one of the wells. It turns into a sprite from some games that Howard Scott Warshaw made, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E

25|$|Sailors might hope to {{supplement}} their meager diets with fish if they were <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> to catch them.

While at sea, when supplies were low, fresh fish such like snapper, shark, catfish, grouper, albacore were caught and often barbecued, though one would have to be certain not to let the deck on fire. When food was scarce, a rationing system may be put in place similar to legal sailors. In some cases, the only items there were requested of the looted victim from pirates was food and drink. When gold or silver was found, food was a popular item to barter for when bartering was easier than fighting.|$|E

25|$|From {{the early}} Christians, early medieval Christians {{inherited}} a church united by major creeds, a stable Biblical canon, and a well-developed philosophical tradition. The history of medieval Christianity traces Christianity during the Middle Ages—the period {{after the fall}} of the Roman Empire until the Protestant Reformation. The institutional structure of Christianity in the west during this period is different from what it would become later in the Middle Ages. As opposed to the later church, the church of the early Middle Ages consisted primarily of the monasteries. The practice of simony has caused the ecclesiastical offices to become the property of local princes, and as such the monasteries constituted the only church institution independent of the local princes. In addition, the papacy was relatively weak, and its power was mostly confined to central Italy. Individualized religious practice was uncommon, as it typically required membership in a religious order, such as the Order of Saint Benedict. Religious orders wouldn't proliferate until the high Middle Ages. For the typical Christian at this time, religious participation was largely confined to occasionally receiving mass from wandering monks. Few would be <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> to receive this as often as once a month. By the end of this period, individual practice of religion was becoming more common, as monasteries started to transform into something approximating modern churches, where some monks might even give occasional sermons.|$|E

60|$|Altogether this world, {{with its}} {{partitioned}} empire and its roomy universal Church, {{seemed to be}} a handsome establishment for the few who were <b>lucky</b> or wise <b>enough</b> to reap the advantages of human folly: a world in which lust and obscenity, lying and treachery, oppression and murder, were pleasant, useful, and when properly managed, not dangerous. And as a sort of fringe or adornment to the substantial delights of tyranny, avarice, and lasciviousness, there was the patronage of polite learning and the fine arts, so that flattery could always be had in the choicest Latin to be commanded at that time, and sublime artists were at hand to paint the holy and the unclean with impartial skill.

50|$|Although freak {{shows were}} viewed as a place for entertainment, they were also a place of {{employment}} for those who could advertise, manage, and perform in its attractions. In an era before there was welfare or worker’s compensation, severely disabled people often found that placing themselves on exhibition was their only choice and opportunity for making a living. Despite current values of the wrongness of exploitation of those with disabilities, {{during the nineteenth century}} performing in an organized freak show was a relatively respectable way to earn a living. Many freak show performers were <b>lucky</b> and gifted <b>enough</b> to earn a livelihood and have a good life through exhibitions, some becoming celebrities, commanding high salaries and earning far more than acrobats, novelty performers, and actors. The salaries of dime museum freaks usually varied from twenty-five to five hundred dollars a week, making a lot more money than lecture-room variety performers. Freak shows provided more independence to some disabled people than today’s affirmative action programs. Freaks were seen to have profitable traits, with an opportunity to become celebrities obtaining frame and fortune. At the height of freak shows' popularity, they were the only job for dwarves.|$|R
25|$|Two {{developments}} {{dominated the}} decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union's {{economic and political}} structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process. After the rapid succession of former KGB Chief Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko, transitional figures with deep roots in Brezhnevite tradition, Mikhail Gorbachev announced perestroika {{in an attempt to}} modernize Soviet communism, and made significant changes in the party leadership. However, Gorbachev's social reforms led to unintended consequences. Because of his policy of glasnost, which facilitated public access to information after decades of government repression, social problems received wider public attention, undermining the Communist Party's authority. In the revolutions of 1989 the USSR lost its allies in Eastern Europe. Glasnost allowed ethnic and nationalist disaffection to reach the surface. Many constituent republics, especially the Baltic republics, Georgian SSR and Moldavian SSR, sought greater autonomy, which Moscow was unwilling to provide. Gorbachev's attempts at economic reform were not sufficient, and the Soviet government left intact most of the fundamental elements of communist economy. Suffering from low pricing of petroleum and natural gas, ongoing war in Afghanistan, outdated industry and pervasive corruption, the Soviet planned economy proved to be ineffective, and by 1990 the Soviet government had lost control over economic conditions. Due to price control, there were shortages of almost all products, reaching their peak in the end of 1991, when people had to stand in long lines and to be <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> to buy even the essentials. Control over the constituent republics was also relaxed, and they began to assert their national sovereignty over Moscow.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems just do not offer a service which will attract people away from their automobiles. Consequently, their {{patronage}} comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look {{at it from the}} standpoint of a commuter who lives in a suburb and is trying to get to work in the central business district (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let us say a five or ten minute walk, and then he may have to wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, he may have to stand unless he is <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> to find a seat. The bus will be caught up in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let him off at a terminal to a suburban train. Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops {{on the way to the}} CBD, and possibly again he may have to stand in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It is no wonder that in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.|$|E
25|$|The {{night of}} 30 January 1895 was stormy. In the North Sea, {{conditions}} were freezing {{and there were}} huge seas. SS Elbe had left Bremerhaven for New York {{earlier in the day}} with 354 passengers aboard. Also at sea on this rough night was the steamship Crathie, sailing from Aberdeen in Scotland, heading for Rotterdam. As conditions grew worse, the Elbe discharged warning rockets to alert other ships to her presence. The Crathie either did not see the warning rockets or chose to ignore them. She did not alter her course, with such disastrous consequences, that she struck the liner on her port side with such force that whole compartments of the Elbe were immediately flooded. The collision happened at 5.30 am and most of the passengers were still asleep.The Elbe began to sink immediately and the captain, von Goessel, gave the order to abandon ship. Amid great scenes of panic the crew managed to lower two of the Elbes lifeboats. One of the lifeboats capsized as too many passengers tried in vain to squeeze into the boat. Twenty people scrambled into the second lifeboat, of whom 15 were members of the crew. The others were four male second-class passengers and a young lady’s maid by the name of Anna Boecker, who had been <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> to be pulled from the raging sea after the first boat had capsized. Meanwhile, {{on the other side of}} the Elbe, Captain von Goessel had ordered all the women and children to assemble there but no other lifeboats were launched because the ropes on the derricks were all frozen up, and so they perished along with the captain. Within 20 minutes of the collision, the Elbe had sunk and the only survivors were the 20 people in the one surviving lifeboat. These people now had to endure mountainous seas and below-zero temperatures and they were 50 miles from land. Things looked bleak; the Elbes distress rockets had not been seen by any passing vessels and so no one knew of their predicament. After five hours in the raging storm, their luck changed. A fishing smack from Lowestoft called the Wildflower found them. In desperate conditions the crew of the Wildflower struggled to pull the 20 survivors from the lifeboat, which had begun to break up. The skipper, William Wright, said later that the survivors would not have lasted another hour in those conditions, and believed that the only reason they had stayed alive for five hours was the expertise of the Elbes crewmen aboard the lifeboat.|$|E
40|$|After {{two decades}} of being a {{monetary}} unification gospel, EMU is at a brink of dissolution. The European (Monetary) Union, including its political significance and economic future has been hanging in balance ever since the May of 2010, most recently reaching {{the very end of}} the rope. This paper attempted to discern historical and constructional origins of the Eurozone crisis, layers or ingredients of the ongoing peril as well as to identify a short-term technical policy response, necessary for avoiding the imminent break-up of the EMU. Last but not least, the article developed a game theoretical pay-off matrix in order to consider the menu and tentative likelihood of representative agents’ available strategy pairs, that in turn revealed three distinct equilibria, one of which will decisively shape the immediate outlook and ultimate fate of the Eurozone. However, the current pairs in the core vs. periphery pay-off matrix of apparently pursued strategies do not lead to the desirable, superior Nash equilibrium. Out of three bargaining equilibria possible, only two are Nash-stable and only one associated with EMU’s survival.

40|$|One {{thing that}} {{we can learn from}} Collective Action (CA) Theory (that is, from the various {{approaches}} to the study of collective action based on non-cooperative game theory) is that cooperation is a complex phenomenon that should never be taken for granted. This does not mean that free-riding or mutual defection are to be considered the only Nash-equilibriums “in town”: only a trivial reading of Mancur Olson’s work would lead to a similar conclusion. Indeed, the central question that CA theory investigates is not whether collective action is rational, but rather when it is rational, that is, under which circumstances individuals find that the benefit of participation exceeds their personal cost. CA theory simply suggests that we assume the worst (i. e. that cooperation is generally problematic) and then seek a solution. Common interests, after all, provide an opportunity for the emergence of collective action. The mere presence of a common interest, however, is not sufficient to define or determine behaviour. In a nutshell, the aim of CA theory is to explain the logic of collective action, rather than the logic of collective inaction. In all her works, including this latest one, Elinor Ostrom reminds us precise-ly this lesson. She strives to provide formal models with an increasingly precise em-pirical content, showing that social dilemmas are not the same for every individual and that any attempt to make sweeping generalisations is bound to fail. Instead, the specifics of the problem and the nature of potential solutions vary depending {{on the nature of the}} collective good and the structured social contexts within which individuals make interdependent choices. What we can demonstrate (if we are <b>lucky</b> and talented <b>enough)</b> is that there are some very interesting patterns of relationships among variables. In this sense, CA theory is better equipped to explain the relativ...|$|R
40|$|The United States is in {{the middle}} of a {{significant}} cultural shift. Until very recently, United States citizens and policy-makers were willing to accept, or at least tolerate, what has become our food status quo [...] a highly subsidized, centralized, industrial food system that is environmentally harmful and unsustainable and encourages unhealthy eating habits. Many citizens and policy-makers are now demanding that we re-evaluate our entire agricultural system from farm to table and look for ways to develop a new food paradigm that is environmentally sound, sustainable, socially equitable, and that makes healthy whole foods available to all. During the summer of 2010, I taught a course titled 2 ̆ 2 Agricultural Policy and the Environment 2 ̆ 2 at Vermont Law School. When I walked into the classroom on the first day I was shocked to see almost fifty students in the class. I taught the same course the year before and had approximately twenty-five students in the class. Although I cannot be sure, I think that if I taught the same course ten years ago I would be <b>lucky</b> to have <b>enough</b> students register to avoid having the course cancelled. Not only did the 2010 course have a very large enrollment, but the students who were in the course were extremely interested and engaged and brought with them a broad range of relevant experience. Some had grown up on farms in various parts of the country while others had chosen to work on organic farms as teenagers or adults. Some students had previously or were currently working on agricultural or food policy matters through a variety of organizations such as land trusts and in a variety of capacities such as being a social worker. Many others, while not having as much direct experience, had learned a great deal about agricultural and food policy through other formal education or independently. The widespread interest in agricultural issues at Vermont Law School mirrors the renewed interest in food policy by the public in general. Unquestionably, many factors contribute to this cultural shift to local foods, including a desire to feel more connected to the land and to interact more with our communities.

30|$|While it {{has been}} proved that in buffer-aided {{relaying}} systems, the MLS schemes can provide both the diversity and coding gains over the T-BRS and MMLS schemes when the all relay channels obey the i.i.d fading, the corresponding diversity and delay performance of the MLS schemes have not been reported when the relay channels experience the practical i.ni.d fading. Thus, in this paper, the MLS schemes are investigated over the i.ni.d Nakgami-m channels. By employing Markov chain model, the statistical descriptions of the MLS schemes are achieved firstly. Then, with the derived statistical descriptions, the average packet delays are investigated over the i.ni.d Nakgami-m fading channels. The obtained {{results show that the}} non-identically distributed relay links impose a severe loss in the diversity and coding gains for the MLS schemes. Moreover, when the disparity of the powers of relay links is very large, the MLS schemes no longer provide any diversity gain over the T-BRS and MMLS ones even if the buffers’ size is enough large. However, when the disparity of the powers of relay links is little relatively, the enough diversity and coding gains can be still provided by the MLS schemes. For the average packet delays, it is achieved that under the i.ni.d fading channels, the average packet delays at all relays are different. The results indicate that at some relays, the average packet delays can be very large, and at other relays, they are small. This phenomenon yields that at some relays, the data packets would be trapped {{for a long time and}} the relay systems with MLS schemes are unstable. However, it is <b>enough</b> <b>lucky</b> that when the powers of S-R links are less than the ones of R-D links, the average packet delays are reduced evidently. Inspired this observation, a W-MLS diversity-delay trade-off scheme is proposed to reduce the delay and to enhance the stability of MLS schemes but still obtain the enough diversity and coding gains over T-BRS and MMLS schemes. In the proposed W-MLS schemes, before selecting a best link, the systems multiply the link gains by a weight vector, such that the equivalent signal-to-noise ratios of S-R links are same, so does the ones of R-D links, such that the data packet delays at all relays are same. By adjusting the weight vector, it is guaranteed that the equivalent SNRs of R-D links are greater than the ones of S-R links, such that the delays can be decreased evidently. Moreover, by designing feasible weight vector, the W-MLS can still provide the enough diversity and coding gains.|$|R
40|$|Many conversations around Australia {{start and}} end on house prices – {{particularly}} for those <b>lucky</b> (or unlucky?) <b>enough</b> {{to live in}} our major capitals. Prices are out of control, with quite extraordinary price increases over recent years. I would know, I have struggled {{to buy a house}} myself. The constant refrain is that something must be done to fix the problem. But what? It should seem obvious that prices will ease if there is a fall in demand, an increase in supply or a cut in taxes on houses. Those really are the three options. We have seen some ideas that will cut the demand for housing (I will use this term to cover apartments as well). First, there could be tighter restrictions on foreigners buying houses. Or at the very least, better enforcement of existing rules. This is likely {{to be one of the}} goals of the Government’s proposal to impose a fee on foreigners who invest in housing and enhance enforcement. This may be a good revenue raiser, and solicit headlines. However, it isn’t clear that this will have a substantial impact on the housing market and it could harm other foreign investment in Australia. A second idea is for higher interest rates to reduce the demand for housing. But the Reserve Bank is caught in a bind: higher rates will stunt economic growth, while lower rates will make housing more unaffordable (it is also debatable whether their mandate really covers housing affordability). Third, borrowing by housing investors could be limited, though action so far on this seems half-hearted. With a deregulated financial market, it is also probably difficult to limit borrowing by investors only. For example, what is to stop me saying to the bank I am an owner-occupier, and then getting a tenant after a short wait? And how would such a limit apply to sub-letting? And of course, a perennial favourite is limits to negative gearing, which is allegedly driving excessive demand by investors. The Henry Tax Review discussed this issue and made some useful recommendations which would decrease the incentive for negative gearing. However, it needs to be noted that limits on negative gearing may lead to higher rents. And neither major party is rushing to implement any such limits. Improved transport also has potential to ‘rearrange’ the demand for housing – reducing demand near the city and increasing it on the outskirts. Here again there are offsetting factors – road and rail construction can be incredibly expensive, and better transport networks can just add to congestion as existing residents just choose to travel more frequently. Increased travel may be beneficial, but it doesn’t assist with housing affordability. All these arguments about cutting demand miss some more significant drivers of demand. In particular, population is likely to be the largest driver of housing demand. Pretty obviously, more people results in an increase in demand for housing. However, I don’t see much of a debate about immigration or population policy when house prices are discussed. The commentators who focus mainly on interest rates or negative gearing are blinkered if they ignore the impact of population growth. The most obvious reason why people don’t discuss population growth is that this debate can easily morph into xenophobia or even racism, which should be abhorred. However, ignoring population is largely a cop-out. Immigration policy is being determined in isolation of the impacts on housing, similarly too the impacts of policies that encourage births. For example, a Productivity Commission study into migration in 2006 only gave passing mention to the impact of migration on the price of land and houses. This seems a surprisingly narrow-minded approach. To be clear, population growth does provide significant benefits to Australia. But the impacts of immigration and higher birth rates on our house prices do need to be considered. The supply side is also frequently missing from the debate. Higher demand for houses for whatever reason can be accommodated if housing supply increases. It is only because supply is constrained that prices have gone up. We could get more supply either by land release on the outskirts of cities (as long as there is good transport), or by increased densities closer in. But State and local governments are only responding reluctantly to relax planning laws. This is a classic case of NIMBY-ism. Everyone wants more houses or apartments being built, they just don’t want them being built next door. I know myself about the opposition to proposals for increased density on Sydney’s North Shore. And in Melbourne, there has been opposition to conversion of ‘green belts’ to residential development. It is sometimes argued that increased demand for houses will encourage an increase in supply. While this is true to some extent, it would never be the case that more buyers (eg foreign investors) will lead to an even larger increase in supply, making prices lower than before. It would be a particularly odd housing market where more buyers lead to lower prices. How many sellers say “Oh people want more of what I 2 ̆ 7 m selling, I should put my prices down”? The standard arguments for a larger market leading to lower prices are economies of scale and innovation, and they don’t apply because no one is producing more land. The other way that housing could be made more affordable is through reductions in taxes and charges such as stamp duties. But State Governments aren’t rushing to do cut stamp duties (with the exception of the ACT), despite the clear evidence of the benefits of doing this. Housing policy is caught in a bind. State and local governments are reluctant to increase supply or cut taxes; while the federal government is reluctant to limit demand. As a result, prices go up. And the reason for this might be because of another bind: if policies did cause house prices to flatline or fall, this would hurt existing homeowners. I don’t expect to see too many homeowners voting for any such policies. This all seems pretty good for homeowners, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, but pity those locked out of the market as a consequence. ___ Michael Potter is an economist working in Sydney.
