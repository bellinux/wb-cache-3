40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{investigate}} how organisations can recruit talents {{and at the same}} time ensure the performance of the recruited talent. The project will investigate theory concerning recruitment of talents from two perspectives; the individual oriented perspective and the social oriented perspective. The theory will be used in order to analyse quantitative data from two interviews; Anders Eldrup, which will benefit the project with a management view on recruiting talents, and Kim who shares his personal experiences of having been a part of a recruitment, along with three other of his former colleagues. From the collected data the project includes a discussion on how to most effectively recruit and retain talents in order to maintain their level of performance. In addition to this, the project concludes that the recruitment strategy of <b>lift-outs</b> could be beneficial for organisations in the future if they thought of combining a social oriented perspective along with an individual oriented perspective.

50|$|With the {{introduction}} {{and production of}} the latest 911, the Type 991, Porsche {{decided to take the}} latest Targa in a different direction from that of the previous water-cooled Type 996/997 cars. The latest Targa was introduced in 2014 and unlike the Type 993/996/997 Targas, the new car has somewhat returned to its earliest Targa roots by the utilizing of a solid roof panel spanning over the front seats. However unlike the manual <b>lift-out</b> panels of earlier 911s, the Type 991 Targa's roof panel is mechanized for automated lift-away and storage under the rear glass roof, which itself is mechanized to lift {{up and out of the}} way as the roof panel is placed into its stowed position. The Type 991 Targa also brings back the styling feature of the 'Targa bar' that was perhaps the most obvious and overt design cue of the air-cooled generation Targas. But unlike the previous Targa hoops, the one used on the Type 991 is in sections, where the horizontal span member is a physically separate piece that itself is mechanized to lift off of its vertical supports in order to allow the solid roof panel and its motorized components to slide rearwards as the panel is being stored within the car.|$|E

40|$|The Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) {{increasingly}} {{is used to}} characterise {{the structure}} and morphology of microelectronic devices whose lateral dimensions steadily are diminishing. The required preparation mainly {{is done by the}} Focused Ion Beam (FIB) technology making use of its time efficient operation and well defined positioning abilities. The FIB-preparation, when applied as a needle based micromanipulator method, is called <b>Lift-Out</b> technique. The <b>Lift-Out</b> technique allows to refrain from performing any conventional preparation steps prior to the FIB preparation and because it restricts the ion beam processing additionally to a strongly minimised volume around the sample, the method reduces the preparation time significantly. Beside microelectronical applications the FIB <b>Lift-Out</b> technique can be applied beneficially for the pinpointed preparation on badly accessible samples as e. g. tooth materials, big steel samples, fracture surfaces of pronounced topography, hollow fibres etc...|$|E
40|$|The device {{features}} {{have shrunk}} to sub-micron/nano-meter range, {{and the process}} technology has been getting more complicated, so TEM has become a necessary tool for PFA imaging and element analysis. Conventional FIB ex-situ <b>lift-out</b> {{is the most common}} technique for precise sample preparation. But this method has some limitations: samples cannot be reprocessed for further analysis; the carbon film supported grid affects the EDS analysis for carbon elements. A new installation will be introduced in this article, which is set up in FIB chamber for in-situ <b>lift-out</b> application.

30|$|Several {{methods can}} be {{utilized}} for {{the preparation of}} a very sharp nano-tip with a diameter smaller than 100 nm. Considering the preparation of SiNWs, a two-step process can be proposed: (i) choosing under optical microscopy a suitable SiNW (diameter, direction, length, etc.) from the Si-growing substrate covered with SiNWs using a pre-prepared W tip; and (ii) welding the SiNW and the W tip in a dual beam system [scanning electron microscope (SEM)-gas injection system and focused ion beam (FIB)] using Pt as solder. As far as the preparation of SiNCs for APT investigation is considered, a conventional <b>lift-out</b> sample preparation can be proposed. The SiNC-based materials are sputtered on a Si substrate and formed by annealing treatments. Using a classical <b>lift-out</b> method, a multilayer (ML) chunk can be mounted on a pre-prepared steel needle [9]. The APT tip is then prepared by annular milling using the FIB [10].|$|E

40|$|Thinning {{specimens}} to electron transparency for {{electron microscopy}} analysis {{can be done}} by conventional (2 - 4 kV) argon ion milling or focused ion beam (FIB) <b>lift-out</b> techniques. Both these methods tend to leave ''mottling'' visible on thin specimen areas, and this is believed to be surface damage caused by ion implantation and amorphisation. A low energy (250 - 500 V) Argon ion polish has been shown to greatly improve specimen quality for crystalline silicon samples. Here we investigate the preparation of technologically important materials for nanoanalysis using conventional and <b>lift-out</b> methods followed by a low energy polish in a GentleMill™ low energy ion mill. We use a low energy, low angle (6 - 8 °) ion beam to remove the surface damage from previous processing steps. We assess this method for the preparation of technologically important materials, such as steel, silicon and GaAs.

40|$|While FIB sample {{preparation}} for {{transmission electron microscopy}} is a well established technique, few examples exist of samples of sufficient quality for atomic resolution imaging by aberration corrected (scanning) transmission electron microscopy (STEM). In this work we demonstrate the successful preparation of such samples from five different materials and present the refined <b>lift-out</b> preparation technique, which was applied here. Samples with parallel surfaces and a general thickness between 20 and 40  nm over a range of several μm were repeatedly prepared and analyzed by Cs-corrected STEM at 60 and 100  kV. Here, a novel ‘wedge pre-milling’ step helps to keep the protective surface layers intact during the whole milling process, allowing features close to or at the sample surface to be analyzed without preparation damage. Another example shows the cross-sectional preparation of a working thin film solar cell device to a final thickness of 10 to 20  nm over μm sized areas {{in the region of}} interest, enabling atomic resolution imaging and elemental mapping across general grain boundaries without projection artefacts.

40|$|We {{report a}} first work on {{nanofabrication}} of hydrogen nanosensor from single ZnO branched nanorods (tripod) using in-situ <b>lift-out</b> technique and {{performed in the}} chamber of focused ion beam (FIB) system. Self-assembled ZnO branched nanorod has been grown by a cost-effective and fast synthesis route using an aqueous solution method and rapid thermal processing. Their properties were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and micro-Raman spectroscopy. These analyses indicate high quality ZnO nanorods. Furthermore, our synthesis technique permits branched nanorods to be easily transferred to other substrates. This flexibility of substrate choice opens {{the possibility of using}} FIB system for handling. The main advantage of the proposed in-situ approach is a controllable <b>lift-out</b> procedure which permitted us to obtain a 90 % success rate for building nanodevices. The fabricated nanosensor uses only single self-assembled ZnO branched nanorod (tripod) to gauge the 150 ppm H 2 in the air at room temperature. The hydrogen sensitivity is in the range of 0. 6 – 2 % depending on which two branches to use.
