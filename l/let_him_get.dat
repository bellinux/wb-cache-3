He offered to surrender the city, including Márquez and the other principal officers, with the sole condition of obtaining a passport to go abroad. Díaz felt that such an offer is pointless considering the city was helpless, and that as for the other leaders I would fulfill my duty. O'Horán insisted that however the city would fall the capture of the wanted officers was uncertain, but his offer guaranteed both. Díaz refused again and warned the General that although he <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>get</b> away that time he would put him under custody as soon as the city was to be captured.|$|E

[...] Lois Kendall gave the book a positive review in Cultic Studies Review, and wrote: [...] "The book is deep, yet light and readable, both for those who have had similar life experiences and who, I am sure, will find solace in this book, and for those with no such personal experience, who will find the narrative fascinating." [...] Publishers Weekly characterized My Life in Orange as [...] "Honest and vivid, this is an absorbing book about survival and good intentions gone awry." [...] Gillian Engberg of Booklist called the book a [...] "stirring memoir", and wrote: [...] "Guest writes with a reporter's sense of economy and restraint, letting absurd, even shocking details speak for themselves." [...] Christopher Hart gave the book a positive review in The Sunday Times, and wrote: [...] "Tim Guest’s extraordinary account of his childhood in the communes of Bhagwan, the notorious Indian guru, is a survivor’s tale, poignant, funny and wise." ...|$|E
