5|$|On May 21, 1832, a small raiding party {{made up of}} some {{independent}} minded braves from Keokuk's village or the Fox {{village at}} Dubuque's Mines carried out a raid on the settlement at present-day Savanna, Illinois on the Plum River. The party originated west of the Mississippi River and were probably motivated {{by a desire to}} collect needed supplies. When the small raiding party arrived at the settlement they found it practically deserted: only three men were present. Of the six men originally at the settlement, three had left when the raiding party arrived: Blundell was away, Upton was hunting nearby, and Davidson had left the area in search of a horse. Of the three men left at the settlement, Hays and Goss were trying to round up livestock, while only Pierce remained at the blockhouse. Pierce heard a dog barking outside and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a small band of Native Americans creeping along the river's edge. He immediately sounded the alarm and Hays and Goss sprinted for the blockhouse. Gunshots started to explode behind the men as they approached the protection of their makeshift fortification.|$|E
25|$|The Ji Gong {{mentioned}} above, {{better known}} as Ji Jike (姬際可) or Ji Longfeng (姬隆丰), {{is said to have}} trained in Shaolin Monastery for ten years as a young man and was matchless with the spear. As the story goes, he later traveled to Xongju Cave on Mount Zhongnan to receive a boxing manual written by Yue Fei, from which he learned Xingyi. However, some believe Ji actually created the style himself and attributed it to Yue Fei because he was fighting the Manchus, descendants of the Jurchens who Yue had struggled against. Ji supposedly created it after watching a battle between an eagle and a bear during the Ming dynasty. Other sources say he created it while training in Shaolin. He was reading a book and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> two roosters fighting, which inspired him to imitate the fighting styles of animals. Both versions of the story (eagle / bear and roosters) state he continued to study the actions of animals and eventually increased the cadre of animal forms.|$|E
2500|$|... "One day, {{soon after}} we'd {{moved to a}} larger {{quarters}} in a South Burlington office park, I <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this tall young guy with an earring and a nearly shaved head wandering around the office. [...] Security had just grabbed him and was hauling him away when he yelled out to me: 'Wait! I blog on MyDD.com!' This was, of course, the political Web site where I'd first heard about Meetup.com. 'You're hired!' I yelled." ...|$|E

50|$|Lucy, now {{apparently}} herself once more, {{reaches out}} to Harker, who stares at the dying van Helsing. At this moment, she <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Dracula's cape flying away in the wind, and smiles enigmatically.|$|R
2500|$|Howard Brennan was a steamfitter who {{was sitting}} {{across the street from}} the Texas School Book Depository and {{watching}} the motorcade go by. He notified police that he heard a shot come from above and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a man with a rifle fire another shot from the southeast corner window on the sixth floor. He said he had seen the same man minutes earlier looking through the window. Brennan gave a description of the shooter, and Dallas police subsequently broadcast descriptions between 12:45p.m., 12:48p.m., and 12:55p.m. After the second shot was fired, Brennan recalled, [...] "This man I saw previous was aiming for his last shot... and maybe paused for another second as though to assure himself that he had hit his mark." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of May 29, 1997, Buckley's band flew to Memphis {{intending}} {{to join him in}} his studio there to work on the newly written material. The same evening, Buckley went swimming in Wolf River Harbor, a slack water channel of the Mississippi River, while wearing boots and all of his clothing and singing the chorus of the song [...] "Whole Lotta Love" [...] by Led Zeppelin. Buckley had gone swimming there several times before. A roadie in Buckley's band, Keith Foti, remained onshore. After moving a radio and guitar out of reach of the wake from a passing tugboat, Foti <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that Buckley had vanished. Despite a determined rescue effort that night, Buckley remained missing. On June 4, [...] two locals spotted his body in the Wolf River near a riverboat, and he was brought to land.|$|E
2500|$|Rayment {{moved the}} {{throttle}} forward slowly and released the brakes; the plane began to accelerate, and radio officer Bill Rodgers radioed the control tower {{with the message}} [...] "Zulu Uniform rolling". The plane threw up slush as it gathered speed, and Thain called out the plane's velocity in 10-knot increments. At 85 knots, the port engine began to surge again, and he pulled back marginally on the port throttle before pushing it forward again. Once the plane reached , he announced [...] "V1", at which {{it was no longer}} safe to abort take-off, and Rayment listened for the call of [...] "V2" [...] (...) , the minimum required to get off the ground. Thain expected the speed to rise, but it fluctuated around 117 knots before suddenly dropping to , and then [...] Rayment shouted [...] "Christ, we won't make it!", as Thain <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what lay ahead.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was an ungallant speech, certainly,' said Nicholas, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> who {{the speaker}} was, and {{recognising}} Miss Snevellicci. 'I {{would not have}} made it if I had known you had been within hearing.' ...|$|R

60|$|No {{one else}} said a word. The captain {{did not even}} <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> who had spoken. He felt the justice {{as well as the}} {{harshness}} of the remark, and poured the water back into the jar.|$|R
2500|$|About 1:00 pm the Wham party {{reached the}} site of the attack. [...] Campbell, who was in the lead, was {{attempting}} to guide her horse around a boulder that was blocking the road {{as the rest of the}} party crested a hill. [...] After the convoy halted, Sergeant Benjamin Brown led his men forward to try to move the obstacle out of the road while Corporal Isaiah Mays took a position at the rear of the convoy. [...] As they approached the rock, the group saw evidence that the rock had been deliberately placed in the road. [...] As they then <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> where the rock had come from, the soldiers saw two men stand up from a breastwork situated above them. [...] Neither of the two men wore masks and the soldiers later identified their attackers as Wilfred T. Webb and Mark E. Cunningham. [...] Local folklore suggests some bandits may have donned disguises, with one attacker dressed to resemble a local figure name William Ellison [...] "Cyclone Bill" [...] Beck. [...] Cunningham was armed with a rifle. [...] Webb brandished a pair of revolvers and yelled, [...] "Get out, you black sons of bitches!" [...] The bandits then began to fire toward the convoy.|$|E

2500|$|Newton's and Patricia's final kiss is {{interrupted}} by a strange noise. They and the others at the field <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a flyover by six English Electric Lightning jet fighters, as the time period reverts to the [...] "present" [...] (1965).|$|R
60|$|When Letty and {{her mother}} came in, they found a much happier looking guest than the one Christie had welcomed an hour before. Scarcely had she {{introduced}} them when voices in the lane made all <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> old Hepsey and Mrs. Wilkins approaching.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, durned {{if some of}} you fellers ain't kind an' complimentary," [...] remarked Macomber, {{scratching}} his head. [...] "But then every feller can't have hoss sense." [...] Then, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Lucy Bostil coming along the road, he brightened as if with inspiration.|$|R
60|$|Then it {{was that}} he heard a {{well-known}} footstep, and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Wulf staring at him.|$|E

50|$|However, Jin, revived by the Devil within him, reawakens and dispatches the soldiers, smashing Heihachi {{through the}} wall of the temple.

50|$|During mating, {{the female}} stands still and holds her head <b>to</b> the side, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the opened {{mouth of the}} male.

50|$|He <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{a janitor}} on The Empire State Building drop a cigarette. He eagerly {{holds out his}} hand to get it, and even tries to use a ladder to get it, but when he does, it's spent completely; nothing but ashes are left of the cigarette.|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{where his}} uncle was standing; but {{in doing this}} he had to throw his head back {{so far as to}} bring a fear suddenly over him of falling from his horse. So he desisted, and continued his conversation without attempting to look.|$|R
6000|$|Rose lingered a moment, feeling much {{inclined}} {{to continue her}} run and pop in upon all the aunts in succession, but, remembering her uncovered head, {{was about to turn}} back when a cheerful [...] "Ahoy! ahoy!"

60|$|They {{talked for}} an hour or more; neither, in fact, took an exact account of the time. Suddenly they <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a dark-faced, correct-looking servant {{standing}} before them.|$|E
60|$|And {{accordingly}} he {{descended from}} the cliffs with some difficulty, and scrambled along between the rocks and the advancing tide; now <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if his motions were watched from the rocks above him, now casting a jealous glance to mark if any boat appeared upon the sea, from which his course might be discovered.|$|R
