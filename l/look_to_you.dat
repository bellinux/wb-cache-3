His teaching combined elements of Hinduism and Islam: he gave the Hindu name Dwarakamayi to the mosque in which he lived, practised both Hindu and Muslim rituals, taught using words and figures that drew from both traditions, and took samadhi in Shirdi. One of his well-known epigrams, Allah Malik (God is King) and Sabka Malik Ek (Everyone's Master is One), is associated with both Hinduism and Islam. He is also known to have said Look to me, and I shall <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E

In January 2010, Nick Jonas performed the song during a concert at the Warner Theatre.

Opposition players {{sometimes}} {{joked that}} Ponsford's bat {{was larger than}} allowed under the laws of cricket and indeed in one match in Sydney, it {{was found to be}} slightly larger than permitted—the result of the bat spreading from his powerful hitting. Throughout his innings, Ponsford would pull his cap further to the left. Robinson claimed that [...] "if you saw the peak at a rakish angle towards his left ear you could tell he was heading for his second hundred". When volunteering for service with the Royal Australian Air Force, Ponsford discovered he possessed abnormal colour vision, unable to distinguish red from green. The examining doctor was astonished and asked Ponsford, [...] "What colour did [...] <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> after it was worn?" [...] Ponsford replied, [...] "I never noticed its colour, only its size." [...] A later study identified Ponsford's specific colour vision as protanopia, a form of dichromacy in which red appears dark. Ponsford did not enjoy batting on rain-affected wickets.

500|$|The horses {{who have}} served as Thunder {{have been trained to}} remain calm in {{situations}} that would normally cause a horse to respond with a fight-or-flight response, such as the flashing explosions of a pyrotechnic display, or items suddenly landing on the field including skydivers with parachutes and various objects thrown by spectators, or loud music and the sounds associated {{with tens of thousands of}} cheering fans at Mile High. Ann Judge has explained that because so many unexpected things can happen, it is important that the people working with him remain calm; it is trust in his rider and handlers, not just desensitization, that helps the horse remain steady: [...] "You want them to <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for the appropriate response and for confidence and faith so that the flight response doesn’t get initiated." [...] She describes the process by saying, [...] "if something is fearful to him, as long as he looks to me, and I tell him he’s OK, he’s OK." [...] The only frightening stimuli that was an ongoing problem for both Thunder Sr. and Thunder II was when the crowd would perform the wave; Thunder Sr. would stand still, but tremble. Thunder II would become tense, requiring ground handlers and his rider to help steady him. Thunder III is the first of the mascots to tolerate wearing earplugs, which help protect his hearing from loud noises during games.|$|E

Houston sang the song live on the HBO special [...] "Classic Whitney Live from Washington, D.C." [...] on both October 3 and 5, 1997. Houston's solo performance was followed by ad-libs of its chorus. She was joined by [...] BeBe Winans, Monica, and Shirley Caesar, who was seated in the audience and invited onstage by Houston. Houston used the song throughout the entire run of her The Pacific Rim Tour (1997).

[...] Slant Magazine critic Sal Cinquemani also wrote I <b>Look</b> <b>to</b> <b>You</b> finds Whitney struggling to hit notes and deliver phrases that should come effortlessly to such a seasoned vocalist; her vocal cords are plagued by edema, her voice reedy and lacking the crystalline clarity it once possessed on classics like [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] and [...] "I Have Nothing".|$|E

Houston's rocky decade isn't ignored, but it isn't explored, either: songs allude to Whitney's strength, her willpower as a survivor struggling through some unnamed struggle — enough for listeners to fill in the blanks, either with their own experience or their imaginings of Houston's life. [...] at the very least, Whitney can still sing, knowing when to wring emotion out of a phrase, knowing when not to push for the glory notes that she can no longer hit. [...] What she undoubtedly is, is a pro – she sells these subdued glitzy productions, she makes boring songs interesting, she remains a forceful, tangible presence." ...|$|E
