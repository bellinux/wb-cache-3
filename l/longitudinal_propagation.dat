This condition brings to a transcendental equation that, numerically solved, gives possible values for the transverse wavenumbers.

The method does not utilize block-matching or iterative solutions and is thus more computationally efficient and suitable for real-time motion estimation over the entire image. The method has been evaluated on 1) phantom measurements and 2) in vivo on the carotid artery wall of 17 subjects, where measurements of the longitudinal displacement of the intima-media complex were compared to our previously validated method. The mean error of the phantom measurements was 2. 0 +/- 3. 3 % (velocities between 2 - 15 mm/s; approx. 60 million estimations).

40|$|Propagation in cardiac {{muscle is}} faster in the {{longitudinal}} {{than in the}} transverse axis of the cells. Yet, {{as a result of}} the larger upstroke velocity of action potentials propagating transversely, it has been suggested that <b>longitudinal</b> <b>propagation</b> is more vulnerable to block. To study the relation between conduction velocity and maximal upstroke velocity (VraJ, as well as the time course of conduction delay and block in the transverse vs. longitudinal direction, thin square pieces of sheep epicardial muscle were superfused with the cellular uncoupler heptanol (1. 5 mM). Action potentials were recorded with microelectrodes at opposite corners of the preparation while stimulating alternately in the longitudinal or transverse direction with bipolar electrodes located at contralateral corners. In all cases, block occurred more promptly for transverse than for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>propagation.</b> The decrease in conduction velocity was greater than expected for V, ^ decay and, in some cases, increased while conduction velocity decreased. In the presence of high grade conduction impairment, foot potentials appeared and the upstrokes became "notched.

40|$|In {{order to}} explore the {{propagation}} law of the impact elastic wave on the platform, the experimental platform is built by using the specific isotropic materials and anisotropic materials. The glass cloth epoxy laminated plate is used for anisotropic material, and an organic glass plate is used for isotropic material. The PVDF sensors adhered on the specific materials are utilized to collect data, and the elastic wave propagation law of different thick plates and laminated plates under impact conditions is analyzed. The Experimental results show that in anisotropic material, transverse wave propagation speed along the fiber arrangement direction is the fastest, while <b>longitudinal</b> wave <b>propagation</b> speed is the slowest. The <b>longitudinal</b> wave <b>propagation</b> speed in anisotropic laminates is much slower than that in the laminated thick plates.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, the <b>propagation</b> of both <b>longitudinal</b> {{and surface}} waves will be {{investigated}} {{within the scope}} of seismic measurements recorded along the circumference of concave structures. The underlying objective herein is to recover, in a non-destructive manner, the mechanical material properties from seismic refraction as well as multiple-channel analysis of surface wave measurements. This experimental set-up along the circumference is currently employed in the case of circular concrete tunnels or shafts when sensors cannot be installed along the structural baseline. The influence of curvature on <b>longitudinal</b> wave <b>propagation</b> will first be quantified by means of a simple analytical model. If curvature is neglected, the thickness of a damaged concrete cover will be overestimated, whereas its <b>longitudinal</b> wave <b>propagation</b> velocity will be underestimated. For surface waves, it will be shown that the influence of curvature exerts a major impact on phase velocity, which cannot be incorporated into the classical multiple-channel analysis of the surface wave forward problem. Consequently, we have developed a numerical model dedicated to such geometries that relies upon complex values of the surface wave phase velocity. The first part of this article is dedicated to the description of the mathematical derivation of the propagation of surfaces wave in a curved medium. This numerical model is then compared with experimental data recorded on a reduced-scale concrete tunnel of metric size. The agreement between experimental and numerical results, as well as seismic refraction and the multiple-channel analysis of surface wave complementarity, form the basis of an in situ, non-destructive testing technique...|$|R
