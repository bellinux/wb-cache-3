2500|$|On June 7, 1937, Curly married Elaine Ackerman, {{who gave}} birth to their only child, Marilyn, the {{following}} year. The couple divorced in June 1940, after which he gained {{a lot of weight}} and developed hypertension. He was also insecure about his shaved head, believing it made him unappealing to women; he increasingly drank to excess and caroused to cope with his feelings of inferiority. He took to wearing a hat in public to convey an image of masculinity, saying he felt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> with his hair shaved off, even though he was popular with women all his life. In fact, many who knew him said women were his main weakness. Moe's son-in-law Norman Maurer {{even went so far as}} to say he [...] "was a pushover for women. If a pretty girl went up to him and gave him a spiel, Curly would marry them. Then she would take his money and run off. It was the same when a real estate agent would come up and say 'I have a house for you'; Curly would sell his current home and buy another one." ...|$|E

[...] An editorial in the Pakistan-based newspaper the Express Tribune commented on the ban of Facebook, [...] "Many users of the social media website have put up their own pages expressing their admiration for the Holy Prophet — surely this is a better response. Furthermore, the said page is one of millions on Facebook and blocking it entirely means that millions of users in Pakistan will be unable to access a site which has become part of their daily life.

60|$|As I {{looked at}} it so mild and sunny, I could not help calling to mind my little brother's face, when he was {{sleeping}} an infant in the cradle. It had just such a happy, careless, innocent look; and every happy little wave seemed gamboling about <b>like</b> <b>a</b> thoughtless <b>Little</b> <b>kid</b> in <b>a</b> pasture; and seemed to look up in your face as it passed, as if it wanted to be patted and caressed. They seemed all live things with hearts in them, that could feel; and I almost felt grieved, as we sailed in among them, scattering them under our broad bows in sun-flakes, and riding over them <b>like</b> <b>a</b> great elephant among lambs. But what seemed perhaps the most strange to me of all, was a certain wonderful rising and falling of the sea; I do not mean the waves themselves, but a sort of wide heaving and swelling and sinking all over the ocean. It was something I can not very well describe; but I know very well what it was, and how it affected me. It made me almost dizzy to look at it; and yet I could not keep my eyes off it, it seemed so passing strange and wonderful.|$|R

[...] In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations.|$|R
