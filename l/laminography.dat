5000|$|Rotational <b>laminography</b> {{requires}} a complex system {{to produce the}} rotating x-ray source, rotate the image detector and maintain synchronization between source and detector. In addition, the <b>laminography</b> systems require a system to map {{the surface of the}} object to be imaged. Product to be imaged is rarely perfectly flat. [...] The 5DX system used a laser mapping system to measure bow and twist so that the effects could be compensated for in the imaging process.In the 5DX system the rotating x-ray source is produced by scanning a high energy electron beam around an x-ray producing target integral to the x-ray tube. The rotating detector is implemented by rotating an x-ray sensitive screen mechanically and projecting the image into a high sensitivity digital camera.Aside from the electro-mechanical complexity, the main disadvantages of classical <b>laminography</b> are the background intensity that reduces the contrast resolution and the fact that in each measurement only one slice is imaged sharply. All other slices have to be inspected consecutively by displacing the object vertically.Classical <b>laminography</b> has been replaced by computed tomography (CT) or computed lamingraphy in more modern automated x-ray systems.|$|E

5000|$|The 5DX {{system used}} {{classical}} <b>laminography</b> {{to create an}} x-ray image “slice”, or image plane that will be distinct from other image planes on the object to be imaged. A slice will remove obstructions above or below the plane of focus so that only the regions of interest remain.X-Ray systems that use methods such as <b>laminography</b> ( [...] or the now more commonly used tomography [...] ) are marketed as “3D” x-ray systems. X-Ray systems that do not use these methods and only produce a transmissive shadow image are marketed as “2D” systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{result was}} an {{accelerated}} commercialization of five inventions: Sequential Electrochemical Reduction Analysis (SERA) by Dr. Morgan Tench enabled manufacturers to improve yield by precisely measuring the solderability of parts before beginning assembly. Reduced Oxide Soldering Activation (ROSA) by Dr. Morgan Tench enabled manufacturers to reduce scrap and materials by restoring solderability {{to the entire}} lot of components before assembly without using flux; Plasma Assisted Dry Soldering (PADS) by Dr. Stephan Bobbio reduced the cost of materials and handling by enabling components to be soldered without flux. A national <b>Laminography</b> Standard by Dr. Thomas Siewert enabled X-Ray <b>laminography</b> inspection machines to be more accurately calibrated. And, Composite Solders by George Lucey and Dr. Roger Clough offered manufacturers the opportunity to reduce inspection and rework by increasing {{the strength of the}} joint.|$|E
50|$|The 5DX was an {{automated}} X-ray inspection robot, which {{belonged to the}} set of automated test equipment robots and industrial robots utilizing machine vision. The 5DX was manufactured by Agilent Technologies. The 5DX performed a non-destructive structural test using X-ray <b>laminography</b> (tomography) to take 3D slices of an assembled printed circuit board. It {{was used in the}} assembled printed circuit board (PCB) electronics manufacturing industry to provide process feedback to a surface mount technology assembly line, as well as defect capture.|$|E
50|$|Classical <b>laminography</b> {{is based}} on a {{relative}} motion of the x-ray source, the detector and the object. The x-ray source and the detector are moved synchronously on circles as shown in the figure. Due to that correlated motion, the location of the projected images of points within the object moves also. Only points from a particular slice, the so-called focal slice, will be always projected at the same location onto the detector and therefore imaged sharply. Object structures above and below the focal slice will move as the rotation occurs. Because of that, they are not imaged sharply and they will blur to a grey background image.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{describes}} 3 D X-ray <b>laminography</b> using {{a projection}} method for reconstruction of arbitrary cross-sectional images. The X-ray inspection images acquired {{from a single}} focal plane include information of the other focal planes as well. Hence projection images of the other focal planes {{can be obtained by}} the geometric projection method for arbitrary height and angle. This paper provides the reconstruction methods of arbitrary cross-sectional image for parallel and cone-beam X-ray and visualization of the object in three dimensions using 3 D <b>laminography.</b> 2 D arbitrary projection images for the other focal planes were obtained by deriving the geometric projection formulae for arbitrary height and angle images. After arbitrary cross-sectional images had been reconstructed by 2 D <b>laminography</b> using projection image sets of all focal planes, 3 D <b>laminography</b> was realized so that the object of ball grid array package was three-dimensionally visualized. For demonstrating 3 D NDT (Non-destruction testing) method, we developed <b>laminography</b> system with CMOS image sensor. Finally, it was shown by experimental results that 3 D <b>laminography</b> of object could be reconstructed correctly by the geometric projection method...|$|E

40|$|Computed <b>laminography</b> (CL) is {{an image}} forming method of X-ray testing that yields images of object slices by a simple linear {{translation}} of the object relative to the tube-detector system. No relative movement of the X-ray tube to the detector is needed and in contrast to classical <b>laminography</b> all object layers {{can be obtained by}} one scan. Moreover CL turns out to be equivalent to a computed tomography (CT) with a limited angular region, which allows the reconstruction of object slices using slightly modified CT algorithms, resulting in higher resolution compared with simple tomosynthesis in the case of classical <b>laminography...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Laminography</b> {{is used to}} {{separate}} overlying structures by focusing on various planes or surfaces in the object. This has typically been performed using film as the imaging medium. In medical <b>laminography,</b> {{also referred to as}} conventional tomography, the x-ray source and film are in motion during the exposure, pivoting about a plane in the object. Details within that plane are in focus in the final film exposure; in contrast, details in planes above and below the pivot plane are blurred. However, this technique requires a new exposure for each plane to be examined, and complicated mechanical arrangements are employed to pivot the x-ray source and film cassette correctly. Digital <b>laminography,</b> on the other hand, uses multiple digital projection images taken statically through the object tilted at discrete angles. These images are then backprojected and combined to focus on a particular depth. The advantage of digital <b>laminography</b> is that the same data can be used to reconstruct many different planes. Thus one can scroll through different depths in the object to determine the variation of structure with depth. In addition, the object manipulation is much simpler than the source/detector pivoting required in conventional <b>laminography...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Laminography</b> is an {{imaging method}} that visualizes a plane of a {{three-dimensional}} object using multiple x-ray imaging [1, 2]. A laminograph {{is produced by}} aligning features in the component radiographs for a particular “plane of focus”and averaging the radiographs to emphasize the features of interest. Due to the averaging process, relative strong features in another plane, while being reduced in intensity, may still be visible after the laminographic process and may cause incorrect human interpretations. A general artifact reduction scheme for <b>laminography</b> is presented in this paper...|$|E

40|$|X-ray {{computerised}} <b>laminography</b> (CL) resonstructs {{cross sections}} {{of an object}} with high resolution. In case of the conventional <b>laminography,</b> well known as radiographic technique, x-ray source and detector system perform movements on rotary or straight lines in two different planes relative to the fixed object, or the source is stationary and both the object and the detector rotate synchronously. Computerised <b>laminography</b> only needs a linear moving of the object relative to the stationary fan-beam and the stationary detector system. Projections measured of different object positions are computer aided reorganised. This reorganised projections are identical to the data collection as used in computerised tomography (CT) with parallel beam geometry. Therefore the in CT well known algorithms as ART {{can be used for}} reconstruction of laminograms. In nondestructive testing purpose CL is suited for investigations of large extended objectslike as process control of sophisticated electronics bo ards. it is not necessary that the whole object is completely in the fan-beam during the whole measurement.

Damage progress is divided into three distinct and consecutive phases: initiation, growth and coalescence. This article illustrates the use of three-dimensional nondestructive imaging to study this damage development. Two techniques, mainly based on the attenuation of X-rays are now used for this type of studies at high resolution: tomography and <b>laminography.</b> The interest of <b>laminography</b> is that samples with larger dimensions (in the form of sheets) than the conventional tomography ones can be used.

40|$|A {{feasibility}} study of measuring 3 D displacement {{fields in the}} bulk during ductile crack initiation via combined Synchrotron Radiat ion Computed <b>Laminography</b> (SRCL) and Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) is performed. In contrast to Tomography, SRCL is a technique that is particularly adapted to obtain in 3 D reconstructed volumes of objects that are laterally extended (i. e., in 2 directions) and thin in the third direction, i. e. sheet-like objects. In-situ <b>laminography</b> data of an initiating crack ahead of a machined notch are used with a voxel size of 0. 7 µm. The natural contrast of the observed 2 XXX Al-alloy caused by intermetallic particles and initial porosity is used to measure displacement fields via a global DVC technique assuming a continuous displacement field. An initial performance study is carried out on data of the same undeformed material but after a substantial shift of the <b>laminography</b> rotation axis {{with respect to the}} imaged specimen. Volume correlations between different loading steps provide displacement fields that are qualitatively consistent with the remote loading conditions. Computed strain fields display a strain concentration close to the notch tip...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThree-dimensional (3 D) digital volume {{correlation}} {{has recently}} been used to assess displacement fields in 3 D via correlation of in-situ 3 D x-ray tomography images. The intrinsic contrast due to microstructural heterogeneities is used in these cases as ‘natural 3 D speckles’. In-situ tomography experiments are typically limited to specimens of diameter of ~ 1 mm when resolutions of ~ 1 μm are required. With synchrotron radiation <b>laminography</b> this limitation can be overcome as specimens with sizes of several centimetres in lateral dimensions and ~ 1 mm in thickness can be used. In the present study the data of an initiating crack in a ductile Al-alloy sheet with initial porosity and intermetallic particles as natural contrast has been acquired by synchrotron radiation <b>laminography</b> for different loading steps. The performance of the technique using <b>laminography</b> data is assessed via correlation of data from two scans of a non-deformed material at different locations within the scanned volume. The correlation of deformed material achieves similar residuals as that of non-deformed material, thereby suggesting successful correlation. The measured displacement fields found {{are consistent with the}} remote loading conditions...|$|E

We describe the specific scan geometry of DPC-CL, {{which consists of}} a Talbot-Lau grating interferometer and a lab-based x-ray tube source, and derive a filtered back-projection (FBP) reconstruction algorithm. The experimental results of a flat sphere phantom {{and a piece of}} ham demonstrate the validity of the proposed technique. The existing DPC-CL methods are based on synchrotron sources and the parallel-beam geometry. In contrast, our approach adopts a more accessible x-ray tube source and a cone-beam geometry.

Difficulties arise from the lack of data, which is intrinsic to <b>laminography</b> and leads to several artifacts, and the little absorption contrast in the 3 D image texture of the studied aluminum alloy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Laminography</b> is a tomographic {{technique}} that allows three-dimensional imaging of flat and elongated objects that stretch beyond {{the extent of}} a reconstruction volume. <b>Laminography</b> images can be reconstructed using iterative algorithms based on the Kaczmarz method. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and demonstrate a new reconstruction algorithm that may provide superior image reconstruction quality for this challenged imaging application. METHODS: The images are initially represented using the coefficients over basis functions, which are typically piecewise constant functions (voxels). By replacing voxels with spherically symmetric volume elements (blobs) based on the generalized Kaiser-Bessel window functions, the images are reconstructed using this new adapted version of the algebraic image reconstruction technique. RESULTS: Band-limiting properties of blob functions are beneficial particular {{in the case of}} noisy projections andwith {{only a limited number of}} available projections. Study showed that using blob basis functions improved full-width-at-half-maximum resolution from 10. 2 ± 1. 0 to 9. 9 ± 0. 9 (p < 0. 001). Signal-to-noise ratio also improved from 16. 1 to 31. 0. The increased computational demand per iteration was compensated by using a faster convergence rate, such that the overall performance is approximately identical for blobs and voxels. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the higher complexity, tomographic reconstruction from computed <b>laminography</b> data should be implemented using blob basis functions, especially if noisy data is expected...|$|E

40|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) is a {{very powerful}} tool in medicine and non-destructive testing but it is unsuitable for planar objects like printed circuit boards or fiber reinforced plastics sheets, due to their strongly varying penetration lengths and spatial restrictions during the scan. A solution {{can be found in the}} use of computed <b>laminography</b> (CL), a technique where the object is irradiated by an oblique angle, thereby circumventing the problems arising in CT. The innovative scanner system CLARA (Computed <b>laminography</b> and radioscopy device) realizes this geometry in a new and efficient way, compared to existing industrial systems. Instead of four translational axes, CLARA only needs one rotational axis, greatly reducing both the costs and the calibration errors. Due to the limited amount of angular coverage and the specific geometric setup, filtered back projection methods used in CT cannot be employed for the reconstruction of laminographic projections. More flexible iterative algorithms like SART (simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique) provide an answer to this challenge and also allow to incorporate a priori knowledge about the object to increase the reconstruction quality. The drawback of these algorithms lies in their high computational demands, resulting in typical reconstruction times in the order of hours. For certain practical applications this may be too time-consuming and therefore an acceleration of the algorithms is necessary. Compared to desktop central processing units (CPUs), modern graphics processing units (GPUs) contain an order of magnitude more cores designed specifically for massive data parallel processing. By designing new algorithms to fully exploit the GPU architecture, reconstruction times can be reduced from hours on a CPU to mere minutes on the GPU, thus allowing the practical use of computed <b>laminography</b> in industrial settings. Areas of application include the inspection of printed circuit boards, fiber reinforced plastics parts of wind energy plants and cars, as well as the general testing of sheet-like objects. We explain the advantages of the CLARA scanner and demonstrate the feasibility of computed <b>laminography</b> by means of CLARA results of industrially relevant inspection challenges using GPU-enhanced algorithms...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Planar <b>laminography</b> is {{a method}} to obtain spatial {{information}} for objects whose geometrical dimensions disallow measurements with classical computed tomography. In coplanar translational <b>laminography,</b> the radiation source is moved relatively to the object and/or to the detector in a plane parallel to the detector plane. A 3 D-image of the studied object can be reconstructed from the measured projections by filtered backprojection. Classical rotational tomographic scans include projections from all sides of an object from equidistant angles. In contrast, <b>laminography</b> is restricted by several distinct geometric limitations. This results {{in a number of}} artifacts interfering in the reconstructed image with real object structures. Projections obtained from different positions are not equally weighted because of the changing distance between radiation source and detector and due to different angles of incidence. A motion of the source in equidistant steps results in non equidistant angular steps which also influence the results. Especially, overshoots close to the boundaries of death angle zones disturb the resulting image of the object. The influences of the different geometric effects on the results of a reconstruction process are discussed here. Several correction approaches to reduce the resulting artifacts are presented. These methods include several angular corrections applied at different steps in the filtering and reconstruction process. A number of artificial phenomena can be reduced considerably with these methods. SNR analysis is used for optimization of 3 D-image quality 1...|$|E
