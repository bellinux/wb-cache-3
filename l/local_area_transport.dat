[...] This was followed in March 2013 by {{the newly formed}} Gloucestershire Local Transport Body (LTB) asking for bids from the <b>local</b> <b>area</b> for <b>transport</b> projects which could be funded in the period 2015 to 2019. The Cheltenham Development Taskforce decided to seek support from the railway industry and key local supporters, to promote a scheme first raised in 2008. This proposed to significantly enhance the station, with new passenger facilities and a new south-facing bay platform to enable terminating London and South Wales services to turn back in the station clear of the mainline {{rather than having to}} run empty to the carriage sidings north of the station at Alstone to reverse as at present.|$|R

50|$|DECserver 250The DECserver 250 was {{a network}} server for {{printers}} for Ethernet Local Area Networks, {{consisting of a}} single box that provided the following: (2) Digital Parallel printer ports, each of which used a male 37-pin connector, (4) EIA RS-232-C/CCITT V.24 asynchronous line interfaces for connecting three serial printers and one serial printer or terminal, and (1) Ethernet interface transceiver port. The DECserver 250 implemented the <b>Local</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Transport</b> (LAT) protocol for communication with service nodes that implemented this protocol on the same Ethernet.

In support of their arguments for keeping the line open, objectors pointed out that traffic on the line was actually increasing, new residential development was taking place and that this justified keeping the line open at least between Guildford and Cranleigh. British Rail reluctantly conceded that passenger traffic was indeed increasing at two places on the line. The objectors also asked whether introduction of modern working practices would reduce costs.|$|E
40|$|University campuses’ {{contributions}} {{to their local}} communities in terms of sustainability are often ambiguous. In developing a research-based partnership with City of Ryde Council, Macquarie University has aimed {{to contribute to the}} city’s community strategic plan which prioritises liveability, connections and environmental sensitivity amongst others. The partnership is also aiming to harness research capacity to key sustainability issues in the <b>local</b> <b>area</b> (including <b>transport,</b> energy and waste), develop the campus as a living laboratory for community engagement with sustainability research, and contribute to institutional goals for sustainability and social inclusion. Drawing on an approach that links local scale social and environmental justice to sustainability, this paper discusses progress in the partnership and identifies key challenges, including differences in {{understanding of the nature of}} research, the local politics of environment and planning in a rapidly growing hi-tech precinct, the competing demands and tensions on research capacity from a business sense, and the ever-present scarcity of resources and the opportunity to build robust foundations for long-term change in short-term performance settings in both councils and universities. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of shopping malls in Europe, the UK and Australia {{over the last}} thirty years or so, raises questions about the disruptive effects of such capital intensive developments on <b>local</b> <b>area</b> shopping facilities, <b>transport</b> and other infrastructures and the maintenance of artificially high prices for goods, whereby the promised greater choice of shops and prices is rarely a genuine free market of competition leading to lower prices. A central question to be addressed is whom these centres represent and belong to. While many claim to exist to ‘serve the community’ almost all malls and centres are private property and the community of shoppers has few, if any rights compared with the conventional high street, which is a public thoroughfare. This permits the management of the centres through their own private security staff, to observe, follow, eject and refuse further admission to anyone considered to be ‘undesirable’. What is different about the newest shopping centres is the routine use of increasingly sophisticated CCTV surveillance equipment to observe and record, for later evidential and entry restriction use, the movements of centre visitors. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{relation}} to the modeling of the interfacial transfer terms in the two-fluid model, {{the concept of the}} interfacial <b>area</b> <b>transport</b> equation has been proposed to develop a constitutive relation for the interfacial area concentration. The interfacial <b>area</b> <b>transport</b> equation can replace the traditional flow regime maps and regime transition criteria. The changes in the two-phase flow structure can be predicted mechanistically and the effects of the boundary conditions and flow development are efficiently modeled by this transport equation. A successful development of the interfacial <b>area</b> <b>transport</b> equation can make a significant improvement in the two-fluid model formulation and the prediction accuracy of three-dimensional two-phase flow simulations. In this paper, the basic concept of the interfacial <b>area</b> <b>transport</b> equation and its formulation have been briefly described.

Study DesignAssess the effectiveness of angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on survival after acute myocardial infarction for Medicare beneficiaries using practice style instruments based on different-sized <b>local</b> <b>areas</b> around patients. We contrasted treatment effect estimates using different <b>local</b> <b>area</b> sizes {{in terms of the}} strength of the relationship between <b>local</b> <b>area</b> practice styles and individual patient treatment choices; and indirect assessments of the assumption violations. ResultsUsing smaller <b>local</b> <b>areas</b> to measure practice styles exploits more treatment variation and results in smaller standard errors. However, if treatment effects are heterogeneous, the use of smaller <b>local</b> <b>areas</b> may increase the risk that local practice style measures are dominated by differences in average treatment effectiveness across areas and bias results toward greater effectiveness. ConclusionLocal area practice style measures can be useful instruments in instrumental variable analysis, but the use of smaller <b>local</b> <b>area</b> sizes to generate greater treatment variation may result in treatment effect estimates that are biased toward higher effectiveness.
