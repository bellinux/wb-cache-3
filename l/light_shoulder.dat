25|$|Early on 25 June 2006, Palestinian militants {{from the}} Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Popular Resistance Committees, and Army of Islam crossed into Israel from the Gaza Strip through an {{underground}} tunnel near Kerem Shalom, and attacked an IDF post. Two Israeli {{soldiers were killed}} and another two, apart from Shalit, were wounded. Two of the attacking Palestinian militants were also killed. Shalit suffered a broken left hand and a <b>light</b> <b>shoulder</b> wound, and the militants captured him and took him via a tunnel into Gaza.|$|E

2500|$|On June 25, armed Palestinians {{crossed the}} border from the Gaza Strip into Israel via a {{makeshift}} tunnel and attacked an IDF post. [...] During the morning attack, two Palestinian militants and two IDF soldiers were killed and four others wounded. The Palestinians captured Corporal Gilad Shalit, who suffered a broken left hand and a <b>light</b> <b>shoulder</b> wound. Hamas claimed that the attack {{was carried out in}} response to June 9 killings, but the IDF concluded that the digging of the tunnel must have taken between 3 and 6 months.|$|E

2500|$|One cell aligned itself {{behind a}} Merkava Mark III tank, another behind a {{concrete}} watchtower, and another behind an armored personnel carrier. The militants simultaneously {{opened fire on}} their targets. The militants that attacked the tank blew open its rear door with an RPG. The tank's gunner, Corporal Gilad Shalit, was wounded by the RPG blast, suffering a broken left hand and a <b>light</b> <b>shoulder</b> wound. Two of the militants then approached the tank. The RPG hit caused the tank {{to go up in}} flames, and its fire extinguisher system was activated. However, the engine stopped working and the ventilation system failed to work as a result, creating suffocating conditions inside. The tank's commander and driver climbed out to escape, and were gunned down by the militants. A militant then climbed onto the tank's turret and threw grenades into the tank, wounding another crew member. Shalit climbed out of the tank to escape the suffocating conditions, and as he emerged onto the turret, he saw one of the militants climbing onto the tank, with his AK-47 strapped to his back. Shalit at this point could have easily killed the militant using the [...]50 caliber machine gun mounted on the turret, but instead surrendered to him. He later told IDF investigators that he was confused and in a state of shock, and thus never thought of shooting him. Shalit was then taken to Gaza with the militants. An Israeli tank soon arrived on the scene and an IDF observation post witnessed their escape, although it was not known {{at the time that the}} militants had a captive Israeli soldier with them, and the tank did not open fire in time, as the commander was awaiting permission. When permission was finally granted, the tank opened fire with its machine guns.|$|E

The eggs are {{incubated}} by both parents for 15 days to hatching, with a further 9 days to fledging. If the nest is approached, an incubating bird will drop {{to the ground and}} flutter weakly to distract the potential predator. During this, the <b>light</b> <b>shoulder</b> stripe is flashed conspicuously to attract the intruder's attention to the parent.|$|E
50|$|The 1968 {{model year}} {{was one of}} {{significant}} change for the Buick Skylark. Although still using the same basic chassis, all of GM’s mid-sized cars adopted a policy of using two different length wheelbases. Two-door models used a shorter wheelbase of 112 in, while four-door models used a longer wheelbase of 116 in (the Buick Sport Wagon and Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser used an even longer wheelbase of 121 in). All of GM's mid-sized cars received all-new sheet metal. More Federally mandated safety features improved occupant protection and accident avoidance, including side marker <b>lights,</b> <b>shoulder</b> belts (on all models built after January 1, 1968), and parking lights that illuminated with headlights.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the most}} popular Hindu worship place is {{situated}} in Tulsipur about 27 kilometers from the district headquarters. It is known as Devi Patan. [...] The temple has the distinction of having included in 51 [...] "Shaktipeethas" [...] of Goddess Durga according to Hindu mythology. It is believed that during the event when Lord Shiva was carrying the corpse of his wife Sati, the <b>light</b> <b>shoulder</b> of Sati had fallen here. Revered by Hindus in India and Nepal, millions of pilgrims visit this place throughout the year. A Grand festival has been organized at the time of Durga Puja. During the month of chaitra a [...] "Mela" [...] has also been organized every year. One of the salient feature of this event is [...] "Shobha Yatra" [...] of Peer Ratan Nath.

2500|$|... 1967 saw the {{introduction}} of U.S. mandated safety equipment to improve occupant protection during a crash, including an energy-absorbing steering column, non-protruding control knobs, 4-way hazard flasher, soft interior surfaces, locking seat backs (on 2-door models), a dual-circuit hydraulic braking system (with warning <b>light),</b> and <b>shoulder</b> belt anchors. [...] The Rivieras complied on all counts and featured {{the full range of}} safety features.|$|R
2500|$|The 1968 models {{featured}} additional safety features, including {{side marker}} <b>lights</b> and <b>shoulder</b> belts on cars built after December 1, 1967. The 1967 model's large {{steering wheel hub}} {{was replaced by a}} soft [...] "bar" [...] spoke that ran though the diameter of the wheel (and like the 1967 style, was used throughout the Ford Motor Company line). A plastic horn ring was also featured.|$|R
50|$|The 1967 {{model was}} {{redesigned}} with enhanced Coke bottle styling that featured Corvette-inspired {{front and rear}} fender bulges. The curves were the most pronounced with the 1967-1968 models. In keeping with federal regulations, safety features were built into Impalas during the 1967 and 1968 model years, including a fully collapsible energy-absorbing steering column, side marker <b>lights,</b> and <b>shoulder</b> belts for closed models. The L72 engine was not available in 1967, but a L36 Turbo-Jet V8 was optional.|$|R

60|$|She possessed more brains {{than she}} cared to exhibit to {{visitors}} like Dr Phelps and Mr Crimble. Even {{to this day}} I cannot believe that Mr Crimble even so much as guessed how clever she was. It {{was just part of}} herself, like the bloom on a plum. Hers was not one of those gesticulating minds. Her efforts only intensified her Fannyishness. Oh dear, how simple things are if only you leave them unexplained. Her very knowledge, too (which for the most part she kept to herself) was to me like finding chain armour when one is in search of a beating heart. She could shed it all, and her cleverness too, as easily as a swan water-drops. What could she not shed, and yet remain Fanny? And with all her confidences, she was extremely reticent. A lift of the <b>light</b> <b>shoulders,</b> or of the flat arched eyebrows, a sarcasm, a far-away smile, at the same time illuminated and obscured her talk. These are feminine gifts, and yet past my mastery. Perhaps for this reason I admired them the more in Fanny--just as, in reading my childhood's beloved volume, The Observing Eye, I had admired the crab's cuirass and the scorpion's horny rings--because, being, after all, myself a woman, I faintly understood their purpose.|$|R

6000|$|She had {{on nothing}} but a hand-woven cotton sarong--one of Heyst's few purchases, years ago, in Celebes, where they are made. He had {{forgotten}} all about it till she came, and then had found it {{at the bottom of}} an old sandalwood trunk dating back to pre-Morrison days. She had quickly learned to wind it up under her armpits with a safe twist, as Malay village girls do when going down to bathe in a river. Her shoulders and arms were bare; one of her tresses, hanging forward, looked almost black against the white skin. As she was taller than the average Malay woman, the sarong ended a good way above her ankles. She stood poised firmly, half-way between the table and the curtained doorway, the insteps of her bare feet gleaming like marble on the overshadowed matting of the floor. The fall of her <b>lighted</b> <b>shoulders,</b> the strong and fine modelling of her arms hanging down her sides, her immobility, too, had something statuesque, the charm of art tense with life. She was not very big--Heyst used to think of her, at first, as [...] "that poor little girl,"--but revealed free from the shabby banality of a white platform dress, in the simple drapery of the sarong, there was that in her form and in the proportions of her body which suggested a reduction from a heroic size.|$|R
40|$|A {{study to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of slllughter weight on carcass characteristics of pigs was conducted using twenty four Landrace X Large lMlite crossbred pigs. Twelve castrates and twelve gilts with average ini-tial weight of 35 ± 4. 4 kg {{were randomly assigned to}} three targeted slllughter weights. Pigs were slllugh-tered at live weights of 60, 75 and 90 kg and measurements of carcass characteristics were taken. Cost effectiveness of each slaughter weight based on feed cost was determined. Slaughter weight of the pigs had significant (P < 0. 05) influence on carcass characteristics. Increase of slaughter weight from 60 kg to 90 kg caused a rise in killing out percentage, loin eye area, carcass length and backfat thicknessjrom 65. 0 t 069. 1 %, 24 to 34 crrt, 85. 1 to 92. 3 qnand 2. 2 to 3. 3 cm, respectively. The proportion of kidney fat also increased with slllughter weight. Generally, the weights of carcassjoints, fillet muscle (M. psoas major), liver and kidney as percent of carcass weight decreased with increasing slaughter weight of the pigs (P< 0. 05). Castrates had significantly heavier kidney fat and <b>lighter</b> <b>shoulders</b> than gilts but there was no signifi cant sex difference in killing out percentage, carcass length, weights of liver, kidney, fillet muscle, ham, loin and belly, back fat thickness and loin eye area. The slaughter weight of 60 kg was found to be more cost effective {{than the rest of the}} slaughter weights and was therefore recommended for areas where there is demand for lean meat...|$|R
