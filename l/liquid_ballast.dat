It is merely a very long rope which is suffered to trail from the car, {{and the effect of}} which is to prevent the balloon from changing its level in any material degree. If, for example, there should be a deposition of moisture upon the silk, and the machine begins to descend in consequence, there will be no necessity for discharging ballast to remedy the increase of weight, for it is remedied, or counteracted, in an exactly just proportion, by the deposit on the ground of just so much {{of the end of the}} rope as is necessary. If, on the other hand, any circumstances should cause undue levity, and consequent ascent, this levity is immediately counteracted by the additional weight of rope upraised from the earth. Thus, the balloon can neither ascend or descend, except within very narrow limits, and its resources, either in gas or ballast, remain comparatively unimpaired. When passing over an expanse of water, it becomes necessary to employ small kegs of copper or wood, filled with <b>liquid</b> <b>ballast</b> of a lighter nature than water. These float, and serve all the purposes of a mere rope on land. Another most important office of the guide-rope, is to point out the direction of the balloon. The rope drags, either on land or sea, while the balloon is free; the latter, consequently, is always in advance, when any progress whatever is made: a comparison, therefore, by means of the compass, of the relative positions of the two objects, will always indicate the course. In the same way, the angle formed by the rope with the vertical axis of the machine, indicates the velocity. When there is no angle--in other words, when the rope hangs perpendicularly, the whole apparatus is stationary; but the larger the angle, that is to say, the farther the balloon precedes the end of the rope, the greater the velocity; and the converse.|$|E

This application consumes {{the greatest amount of}} calcium chloride. Calcium chloride is relatively harmless to plants and soil. As a de-icing agent, it is more effective at lower temperatures than sodium chloride. When distributed for this use, it usually takes the form of small, white spheres a few millimeters in diameter, called prills. Solutions of calcium chloride can prevent freezing at temperature as low as −52 °C (−62 °F), making it ideal for filling agricultural implement tires as a <b>liquid</b> <b>ballast,</b> aiding traction in cold climates.|$|E
40|$|A {{three years}} {{research}} project {{was developed to}} study tractor-implement dynamics in tillage operations. The field tests with trailed disc harrows were performed under real working conditions, in dry medium textured soils, in primary and secondary tillage. The specific objective {{of the study was}} evaluating the <b>liquid</b> <b>ballast</b> and tire inflation pressure effects on tractor performance parameters. Were tested two different static ballasts, with and without tire <b>liquid</b> <b>ballast,</b> and three different inflation pressures: the inflation pressure specified by the manufacturer of tires (100 kPa in front tires and 70 kPa in rear tires); the inflation pressure specified by the tractor manufacturer (140 kPa in the tires of both axles); and the inflation pressure typical of the farmers in region (190 kPa in the tires of both axles). A four-wheel-drive, 59 kW (DIN), Massey-Ferguson 3060 Datatronic tractor and two trailed type medium-weight offset disc harrows, was used in the field trials. The instrumentation system to determine energy requirements and efficiencies of tractor-implement, include a portable computer based record system mounted in the tractor, developed to record the information provided by TPM "Datatronic", which also records the information from a load cell based pull measuring system. The evaluation parameters were: the slip, the real distance, the work rate, the overall energy efficiency and the fuel consumption per hectare. The field tests were conducted in different soil and conditions types. The results obtained show that the use of the <b>liquid</b> <b>ballast</b> in the tires didn’t improve the work rate, and it even caused a 5 to 10 % increase in the fuel consumption per hectare. To avoid soil compaction, as well as to permit a more efficient general utilisation of the tractor, the common and indiscriminate use of <b>liquid</b> <b>ballast</b> should be questioned. It was also proved that concerning the situations of tire inflation pressure specified by the tractor manufacturer and the inflation pressure specified by the manufacturer of tires, there were no significant differences, both in work rate and in fuel consumption per hectare. The use of higher tire inflation pressures, showed a light diminution (3 % to 5 %) in the work rate and a great increasing in the fuel consumption per hectare (10 % to 25 %), even in good traction conditions displayed by the interval of slip values (7 % to 15 %). In these dry farming soils the above practices should be questioned...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{tractive}} efficiency (TE) of MF 285 and U 650 tractors during moldboard plowing were evaluated and compared. Field experiments were {{conducted at the}} Experimental Station, College of Agriculture, Shiraz University, using a randomized complete block design with a 3 * 3 factorial. The soil was sandy clay loam with an average moisture content of 18 % b. d. from zero to 30 cm depth. Test treatments were combinations of three tractor types or conditions (U 650, MF 285 <b>liquid</b> <b>ballasted</b> and MF 285 with no <b>liquid</b> or weight <b>ballast)</b> and three levels of plowing depth (10 - 15 cm, 15 - 20 cm and 20 - 25 cm). Plowing speed was kept constant at about 4 km/h throughout the experiment. The measured or calculated parameters included: tractor drawbar pull and rolling resistance, drive wheel slip and tractor tractive efficiency. Statistical analysis of the test {{results showed that the}} primary difference between the tractor types or conditions was in their wheel slip, such that the average wheel slip of U 650 was lowest (12. 6 %) while that of unballasted MF 285 was highest (27 %) and was reduced to 17. 7 % with <b>liquid</b> <b>ballasting.</b> Also, while growth of unballasted MF 285 wheel slip with increasing plowing depth was drastically high (11 % to 48 %), that of U 650 was quite moderate (9. 7 % to 16. 5 %). Analysis of the calculated values of TE showed that there was no significant changes in the TE of U 650 with increasing plowing depth and that with an average of 73. 8 %, it had a desirable performance. The TE of unballasted MF 285 that was over 75 % at shallow plowing, dropped to 46 % with increasing plowing depth, while water ballasting improved the decreasing trend of TE with plowing depth and raised its minimum value to about 63 %. The overall results of this study showed that unballasted MF 285 tractors had desirable TE only at shallow plowing and that for medium and deep plowing, U 650 or water ballasted MF 285 tractors should be used...|$|R

40|$|Lake Ontario has an {{extensive}} history of biological invasions, extending more than 170 years. The rate of invasion began to increase during the 1870 s, and accelerated {{after the opening}} of the St. Lawrence Seaway in the 1950 s. Currently, there exist approximately 60 nonindigenous species (NIS) of vertebrate and invertebrate animals, protozoans, algae and aquatic macrophytes established in the lake. Fish are the most widely represented taxon (15 species), followed by algae (14 species), molluscs (11 species) and crustaceans (8 species), respectively. Vectors responsible for NIS introductions vary temporally and by taxon. Before 1920, deliberate release and solid shipping ballast were the dominant vectors for NIS introduction. Ships’ ballast water was the dominant vector between 1961 and 2002. All algal species, and most of the crustaceans and protozoans, were introduced via ballast water discharge, whereas fish vectors consisted of deliberate introductions, canals, accidental introductions, ballast water discharge, and bait release.

40|$|FLNG is a {{new type}} of {{floating}} LNG platform which is ship-shaped FPSO hull equipped with LNG storage tanks and liquefaction plants and has been developed as an alternative to long pipelines to LNG liquefaction plant on land for stranded offshore fields. Different to the conventional FPSO, the hydrodynamic performance of the being-proposed FLNG can be significantly affected by the inner-tank liquid sloshing, {{due to the fact that}} LNG performs better liquidity than crude oil. In order to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of FLNG with large hull and high center of gravity, a series of numerical simulations on an FLNG designed by CNOOC and MARIC were conducted with the help of the well-known code WADAM. In addition, corresponding model tests on the same vessel with solid ballast were completed, serving as a verification of the numerical simulations. In order to inspect the sloshing effects of inner tanks on the global motion responses of the FLNG vessel, model tests with <b>liquid</b> <b>ballast</b> were also conducted. Comparisons were made between numerical and experimental results with methods of Fast Fourier Transformation technology and spectral analysis. The numerical simulation results were in good accordance with those of the model tests, which proves the feasibility of the numerical simulations.

40|$|Tractive {{efficiency}} and fuel consumption of Massey Ferguson (MF 399) and John Deere (JD 4230) tractors during plowing with moldboard plow were evaluated and compared. The {{tests were conducted}} at the Experimental Station, College of Agriculture, Shiraz University, in a field with sandy clay soil at average moisture content of 18 % d. b. from zero to 30 cm depth. A randomized complete block design with a 4 3 factorial was used in three replications. The treatments consisted of two types of tractors, MF 399 and JD 4230, each at two levels of axle load (standard and <b>liquid</b> <b>ballasted)</b> and three levels of plowing depth, shallow (15 - 20 cm), medium (20 - 25 cm) and deep (25 - 30 cm) using a semi-mounted 4 -bottom moldboard plow. In all treatments, the tractor engine speed was set at rated rpm (2000 and 2200 for MF 399 and JD 4230, respectively) and forward speed was kept constant at about 4. 5 ± 5 km/hr. The measured and calculated parameters included: drawbar pull, rolling resistance, wheel slip, tractive {{efficiency and}} fuel consumption. The results indicated that tractive efficiency of MF 399 in deep plowing increased from 36. 5 % to 53 % with ballasting the drive wheels, even though the improved traction was not {{comparable to that of}} JD 4230 (64 %) at the same plowing depth. However, at ballasted condition it is comparable to JD 4230 at shallow and medium depth plowing due to its lower fuel consumption. Using ballasted JD 4230 for shallow depth plowing is not economically justified due to the excessive fuel consumption and may cause soil compaction due to the lower than optimum wheel slippage. Generally, using MF 399 is recommended for lower draft and JD 4230 for higher draft tillage operations. Otherwise, MF 399 will encounter severe reduction in tractive efficiency and excessive increase in fuel consumption and JD 4230 will cause soil compaction...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{a study of}} inner-tank sloshing effect on motion responses of a Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) system, through experimental analysis and numerical modeling. To investigate hydrodynamic characteristics of FLNG under the conditions of with and without LNG-tank sloshing, a series of numerical simulations were carried out using potential flow solver SESAM. To validate the numerical simulations, model tests on the FLNG system was conducted in both <b>liquid</b> and solid <b>ballast</b> conditions with 75 % tank filling level in height. Good correlations were observed between the measured and predicted results, proving the feasibility of the numerical modeling technique. On the verified numerical model, Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) of the FLNG with 25 % and 50 % tank filling levels were calculated in six degrees of freedom. The influence of tank sloshing with varying tank filling levels on the RAOs has been presented and analyzed. The results showed that LNG-tank sloshing has a noticeable impact on the roll motion response of the FLNG and a moderate tank filling level is less helpful in reducing the roll motion response...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the dynamics of}} the tractor-implement combination in traction works, in the specific soil conditions present in Southern Portuguese agriculture. The tillage operations are very power demanding and are therefore responsible for significant energy inputs. The inappropriate operation of the tractor, in regarding to engine and gearbox speeds and poor management of ballast and tire inflation pressure, combined with poor regulation of tillage implements can result in significant energetic efficiency losses with impact on the economic returns that can be provided by agriculture to farmers and the viability of agricultural enterprises. The purpose of this project was to study tractor-implement dynamics in tillage operations. A portable computer- based recording system (data acquisition system) was developed and installed on tractors to monitor engine speed, fuel consumption, actual forward speed, wheel slip and draught force required for trailed implements. The field tests were performed under real working conditions. Field trials carried out under different working conditions allowed, firstly, to establish predictive models for traction effort and fuel consumption per unit of area that can be used by farmers as a reference when working with trailed offset disc harrows, and secondly, to quantify the actual fuel savings that can be obtained by selecting an engine speed of about 80 % of rated speed, using the highest allowed gear ratio, by adjusting the tire inflation pressure and <b>liquid</b> <b>ballast</b> for each work situation (according to the coefficient of traction and traction-wheel slip) and adjusting the gang angle of the trailed disc harrow (and the working width and depth) to the soil conditions (soil type and moisture content) ...|$|E

In order to restore the ships operational flexibility and achieve the necesssary/desired list correction, this study determines the effect of adding solid ballast to a series of voids/tanks identified on the 2 nd, 4 th, and 8 th descks. Based on this ballast density, tank location and capacity, ease of ballast installation, minor tank structural modifications, and a decision making cost analysis, solid ballast was determined to be the most advantageous for use in correcting the inherent list on the Nimitz {{class aircraft}} carriers. Fresh water ballast was also examined as a possible alternative, but not as extensively due to the large quantity of water required and its limited ability to achieve a list correction. Nimitz class aircraft carriers currently have an average list of 1. 5 degrees and a KG of 47 feet. Since their allowable KG cannot exceed 48. 5 feet, the average service life allowance (SLA) for KG is approximately 1. 5 feet. This study shows that by adding approimately 400 Iton of solid ballast, list can be corrected by 1. 5 degrees with only a 0. 1 percent increase of KG. Thus, to permanently fix the average Nimitz class aircraft carrier starboard list, their would be a 0. 05 foor increase in KG, which in all cases is within the SLA. Additionally, this study shows that this 1. 5 degree list correction can be accomplished at a low cost of approximately $ 1, 200 per Iton.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{two-dimensional}} model tests {{has been conducted}} to study the coupling between global roll motions of a floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) vessel and internal slosh-ing. The model of the FLNG is allowed to move freely in roll under the excitations of an initial heel angle, band-limited waves, and regular waves. To clarify the coupling effects, the FLNG vessel in different filling conditions is ballasted in fresh water and equivalent steel ballast weights, respectively. Time series of both the internal sloshing and the global motions of the vessel are measured. Statistical and spectral analyses {{have been carried out}} on the measured data. Sloshing oscillations in different surface modes have been observed. Asymmetry of the internal wave profile relative to still-water surface is also observed. Attempts are made to clarify the influences of the internal sloshing on the global roll motions through the comparison of the experiment results between the <b>liquid</b> and steel <b>ballasting</b> cases.
