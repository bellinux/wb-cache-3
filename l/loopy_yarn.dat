50|$|Friction spun yarns DREF yarns have bulky {{appearance}} (100-140% bulkier {{than the}} ring spun yarns). The twist is not uniform and found with <b>loopy</b> <b>yarn</b> surface. Friction spun yarns {{with a high}} %age of core have a high stiffness. Friction spun yarns are usually weak as compared to other yarns. The yarns possess only 60% of the tenacity of ring-spun yarns and about 90% of rotor spun-yarns. The increased twist and wrapping of the sheath over the core improve the cohesion between the core and sheath and within the sheath.|$|E
