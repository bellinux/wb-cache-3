During the last few years large shares of grassland have been converted to arable farm land to grow crops needed in an intensified dairy production and for biofuels. The possible impacts of such conversions on breeding bird populations of four key species are determined. The results indicate that the increase of arable farm land during the past six years has drastically reduced suitable bird habitat, which considerably diminishes the number of breeding pairs supported by the environment. Further land conversion is likely to have a less pronounced impact on bird populations compared to the consequences of the latest shift from grassland to arable farm <b>land.</b> Recent <b>declarations</b> of additional bird sanctuaries are supposed to alleviate the pressure on endangered bird species.

It was based on peasants from the royal estates only, who received a unit of <b>land</b> (<b>łan)</b> in exchange for their service. The formation numbered about 2,300 and after early disappointments was never seen as of much military value. It supplemented the few small units of haiduk infantry, which saw service in Poland primarily around late 16th and 17th centuries. In 1655 a new infantry unit was created, the żołnierz dymowy (or żołnierz łanowy– lit. chimney or łan soldier, named again after the type of tax applied). It required all lands, no matter whether owned by king, nobles or the Church, to provide peasant recruits, and applied a similar requirement to towns.|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{the article}} was {{to find out whether}} tax {{registers}} from 1629 may be used in statistical and demographic research. The article was also to answer the question what is a number and structure of the dependent population that is recorded in mentioned tax registers in various estates. Studies took a form of a survey and included {{only a small part of}} the tax registers of Pilzno and Sandomierz counties. A detailed analysis was carried out for records on landed estates belonging to the family of princes Zasławski. The choice was made on purpose as Zasławski family had the largest properties in both above mentioned counties. Members of this family were also the biggest landowners in Sandomierz voivodeship as well as in the entire Crown. In 1629 the owner of landed estates of princes Zasławski in Sandomierz voivodeship, juvenile entailer of Ostróg – Władysław Dominik prince Zasławski, owned the largest hereditary landed estate in county of Pilzno. His estates included: half of Tarnów city, half of its four suburbs, 34 villages and 4 parts of villages. In those estates there were farmed 290, 424 <b>lans</b> of <b>land</b> and total taxes amounted to 1893 florins and 12 dinars. Such a sum accounted for 12, 08 % of total taxes from Pilzno county and 16, 99 % of taxes obtained from estates owned by the local nobility. In the neighboring Sandomierz county landed estates of princes Zasławski owned by young entailer of Ostróg included: 4 towns, 44 villages and 3 parts of villages. There were farmed 198, 385 <b>lans</b> of <b>land</b> there and total taxes amounted to a significant amount of 2188 florins and 24 groszy. It accounted for 9, 95 % of total taxes from Sandomierz county and 20, 94 % of the tax paid by the local nobility. Therefore, according to the data from both analyzed records, in 1629 landed estates of princes Zasławski in Sandomierz voivodeship included: 4 ½ of the city, half of 4 suburbs, 78 villages and 7 parts of villages. In those estates there were farmed 488, 793 <b>lans</b> of <b>land</b> from which taxes amounted to 4081 florins 24 groszy and 12 dinars. However, it should be noticed that properties in Sandomierz voivodeship were only a part of all landed estates owned by princes Zasławski. At that time their enormous latifundium consisted of 50 cities and about 750 villages. In the entire Commonwealth no other magnate family of that time owned so extensive properties. After calculations it was found out that in landed estates of Władysław Dominik prince Zasławski located in Pilzno county in 1629 lived 8895 people. Rural population (8040 people) accounted for 90, 39 % of the studied population while in cities lived 855 people, that is approximately 9, 61 % of all residents of estates. In his estates lying in Sandomierz county lived 8042 people. Rural population (4174 people) accounted for 51, 9 % of the studied population while in cities lived about 3868 people, thus 48, 1 % of all residents of these properties. In 1629 in villages owned by Władysław Dominik prince Zasławski there were living 5214 peasants whit their families, 1723 smallholders, 4125 landless peasants and 1152 people engaged in production, trade or services. This population accounted for a total of 12 214 people. Of all inhabitants of villages peasants constituted 42, 69 %, smallholders 14, 11 % and landless peasants 33, 77 %. It is worth underlying that a significant proportion (9, 43 %) of rural population were persons engaged in production, trade or services. The analyzed tax registers gave also interesting information concerning cities owned by entailer of Ostróg. It can be concluded that in 1629 in those cities lived 1539 people obliged to pay taxes. In this group landless peasants accounted for 7, 99 %, craftsmen – 78, 17 % and people engaged in trade – 8, 38 % of the population. What is more, families of people providing various services amounted to 4, 87 % of urban population. Rogues (hultaje) and people from the margins of society amounted to 0, 59 % of the tax payers. In cities belonging to princes Zasławski lived also 3184 people for whom there are no records to establish the area of their livelihood. Therefore, urban population in Sandomierz county’s landed estates of entailer of Ostróg amounted to 4723 people. Residents paying taxes who were stated in the registers accounted for little more than 32, 58 % of the population. Thus in 1629 total estimated population living in princes Zasławski landed estates in the Sandomierz voivodeship amounted to 16 937 people (12 214 inhabitants of villages and 4723 residents of cities). Therefore, rural and urban population accounted for 72, 11 %, and 27, 89 % of the studied population, respectively. It is believed that this estimation reflects the reality (although estimates may be too low). Thanks to the results obtained in the study one may conclude that conscript records are important and in many cases even irreplaceable source of information that may be used in various statistical studies...|$|R

The village was seized by the Turks, who destroyed the local orthodox church, but was then retaken by royal forces. In commemoration of this victory, bishop Józef Szumlański founded a new Orthodox church and a small monastyr, both devoted to Saint Onuphrius. Although the Jabłonowskis withdrew their claim to the village, the conflict continued, as bishop Szumlański claimed the village to himself rather than to Orthodox church in general and Basilian friars of Krylos continued to question that in courts for another 20 years, until bishop Lew Szeptycki finally settled the issue in 1780.|$|R

In fact they substituted for the positive guidance of the Magisterium a counterfeit orthodoxy of political correctness, money, and secular prestige. This book, Right or Wrong, is a compilation of columns Professor Rice wrote for the campus newspaper, The Observer, from 1970 through 2010. Those bi-weekly columns are concise, readable, and practical. They offered the students an access to the authentic teachings of the Church {{that they might not}} otherwise get in the politically correct “Catholic” university of Land O’Lakes. Those columns present those teachings, not as abstractions, but as practical guides to real-life issues. Drawing upon his wide experience in constitutional law, jurisprudence, tort, and other areas, Professor Rice tells it like it is {{on a wide range of}} issues, including abortion, euthanasia, contraception, homosexuality, pornography, clergy sex abuse, feminism, marriage, bioethics, the death penalty, just war principles, the War on Terror, “Catholic” politicians, etc., etc. He describes Land O’Lakes as a “suicide pact” that has made “Catholic” universities subservient to government, corporate donors, foundations, and the secular educational establishment. Professor Rice, however, goes beyond criticism. He offers a very practical way for Notre Dame to recover its Catholic identity. And he urges that we pray, especially through the intercession of Notre Dame, Our Lady, for her University and for our country. [URL]...|$|R

Whereas {{in the early days}} of serfdom in Poland, the peasant might have been required to farm less than three weeks in a year for his lord, in the 16th century, a weekly service of 1-2 man-days become common, and in the 18th century, almost all of a peasant's time could have been requested by the lord, in extreme cases requiring a peasant to labor eight man-days a week per 1 <b>łan</b> of <b>land</b> farmed by a peasants family for their own needs (the land belonged to the landlord), which in practice meant that the male head of the family worked full-time for the lord, leaving his wife and children working on the peasant's family land, and even then they had to help him occasionally, unless a peasant hadn't hired additional workers (poorer peasants). Simultaneously, peasantry rights (to own land, to leave it, or to have independent, royal justice) were reduced. 1521 marked the end of the peasant right to complain to the royal court. By the mid-16th century no peasant could leave the land without explicit permission of the lord. The situation of individuals who did not own land also worsened (migrant peasant workers), as several laws attempted to force them to become peasants (serfs). They were also forced to partake in various monopolies of their local lords (such as to buy drinks only in the tavern owned by the lord, or use only the lord's owned mills). Due to increased population, and impact of certain laws, individual peasant estates became steadily smaller. This resulted, particularly from the second half of the 16th century, in increased impoverishment of the peasantry, banditry and the occasional peasant uprising. This phenomenon was also witnessed in several other Central and Eastern European countries, and was known as the [...] "second serfdom" [...] or [...] "neo-serfdom".|$|R

At the immediate beginning of the reign stands the Wills Act 1837. The transfer of real estate was simplified by the Real Property Act of 1845 and by the Conveyancing Acts of 1881 and 1882. Additional powers of dealing with settled estates were given by the Settled Estates Act 1856, later by the Settled Estates Act 1877, and the Settled Land Act 1882. Succession duty was levied {{for the first time}} on freeholds in 1853. The strictness of the Mortmain Act was relaxed in favour of gifts and sales to public institutions of various kinds, such as schools, parks and museums. The period of limitation was shortened for most purposes from twenty to twelve years by the Real Property Limitation Act 1874. Several acts were passed dealing with the enfranchisement and commutation of copyholds and the preservation of commons and open spaces. The Naturalization Act 1870 enabled aliens to hold and transfer land in England. The Felony Act 1870, abolished forfeiture of real estate on conviction for felony. The Agricultural Holdings Acts 1883 and 1900, and other acts, gave the tenant of a tenancy within the acts a general right to compensation for improvements, substituted a year's notice to quit for the six months' notice previously necessary, enlarged the tenant's right to fixtures, and limited the amount of distress. By the Intestate Estates Act 1884 the law of escheat was extended to incorporeal hereditaments and equitable estates.
