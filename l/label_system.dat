The additional entries are {{marked with the}} Volume <b>Label,</b> <b>System,</b> Hidden, and Read Only attributes (yielding 0x0F), which is a combination that is not expected in the MS-DOS environment, and therefore ignored by MS-DOS programs and third-party utilities. Notably, a directory containing only volume labels is considered as empty and is allowed to be deleted; such a situation appears if files created with long names are deleted from plain DOS. This method {{is very similar to}} the DELWATCH method to utilize the volume attribute to hide pending delete files for possible future undeletion since DRDOS6.0 (1991) and higher. It is also similar to a method publicly discussed to store long filenames on Ataris and under Linux in 1992.|$|E

The singer had previously expressed dissatisfaction with the label, first telling SOHH.com that they [...] "stopped all promotion whatsoever on the album" [...] after releasing the first single, [...] "Feedback". In early September she had stated, [...] "I can't say if we'll be working {{with them in the}} future. I don't know what the future holds between the two of us."

The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) responded by introducing {{an early version of}} their content warning label, although the PMRC was displeased and proposed that a music rating system structured like the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system be enacted. The RIAA alternatively suggested using a warning label reading [...] "Parental Guidance: Explicit Lyrics", and after continued conflict between the organizations, the matter was discussed on September 19 during a hearing with the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Notable musicians, Frank Zappa, Dee Snider, and John Denver each testified at this hearing with strong opposition to PMRC’s warning <b>label</b> <b>system,</b> and censorship in general. Approximately two months after the hearing, the organizations agreed on a settlement in which audio recordings were to either be affixed with a warning label reading [...] "Explicit Lyrics: Parental Advisory" [...] or have its lyrics attached on the backside of its packaging.|$|E

The album cover was designed by Peter Saville, who would go on to provide artwork for future Joy Division releases. Unknown Pleasures was released in June and sold through its initial pressing of 10,000 copies. Tony Wilson said that the relative success of the album turned the indie label into a true business and a [...] "revolutionary force" [...] that operated outside of the major record <b>label</b> <b>system.</b> Reviewing the album for Melody Maker, writer Jon Savage described the album as an [...] "opaque manifesto" [...] and declared [...] "eaving the twentieth century is difficult; most people prefer to go back and nostalgise.

40|$|The food {{industry}} nowadays is becoming customer-oriented and needs faster response {{time to deal}} with food incidents. There is a deep need for good traceability systems to help the supply chain (SC) partners to minimize production and distribution of unsafe or poor quality products, which in turn will enhance the food SC performance. The current food <b>labeling</b> <b>systems</b> implemented in developing countries cannot guarantee that food is authentic, safe and of good quality. Therefore, the use of origin labels, mainly the geographical indications (GIs), allows SC partners to define quality standards and defend their products' reputation. According to our knowledge there are no studies discussed the use of GIs in developing countries. This research represents a research schema about the implementation of European quality <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> in developing countries and its impact on enhancing SC performance. An empirical study was conducted on the Egyptian traditional food sector based on a sample of seven restaurants implementing the Med-diet <b>labeling</b> <b>system.</b> First, in-depth interviews were carried out to analyze the Egyptian traditional food SC. Then, a framework was developed to link the European quality <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> and SC performance. Finally, a structured survey was conducted based on the applied framework to investigate the impact of Med-diet <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> on the SC performance. The research provides an applied framework linking Med-diet quality <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> to SC performance of traditional food sector in developing countries generally and especially in the Egyptian traditional food sector. The framework {{can be used as a}} SC performance management tool to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of {{food industry}}'s SC performance...|$|R

40|$|Recycling {{has become}} a more {{prevalent}} practice {{in the last few}} decades. However, the <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> on today’s packaging is not always clear in indicating whether something is recyclable. Recently, there has {{been a great deal of}} attention directed at a new system, known as the How 2 Recycle label, an innovative <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> expected to launch in the next few years. As the population continues to grow at unprecedented levels and more strain is placed on the global environment, recycling becomes more crucial. In the United States, the lack of a standard system for recycling on labeling and packaging deters people from properly recycling recyclable mat­erials. However, if a well-designed, standardized system were developed and employed, more people would practice recycling and thus, less recycled material would be thrown away into landfills. The purpose of this study was to examine the disadvantages of the current <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> on packaging and its efficiency in encouraging consumers to properly recycle. It also looks at the How 2 Recycle <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> and how it compares to the current system. A survey was conducted to gather data in order to establish how effective these two <b>labeling</b> <b>systems</b> are at communicating recyclability. The primary research objectives were to determine the efficiency of the current <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> on packaging and evaluate the potential of the How 2 Recycle label. Results from the survey data demonstrated the inefficiency and weaknesses of the current system.

40|$|In 2004, the Dutch National Sustainable Building Center {{set up a}} {{research}} project to investigate the widespread belief that sustainable building is more expensive than standard building practice. The results disproved this assumption and demonstrated that sustainable building can be financially profitable. However, the research also showed that these positive financial aspects are hardly ever used to promote sustainable building. SenterNovem initiated a new research project in order to recommend practical solutions for the identified issues. Besides the sustainable and ‘regular’ building sectors, the new project included other sectors {{in an effort to}} develop new insights.

The system should clearly identify the level of sustainability of a specific house. To gain acceptance among consumers, the system would have to tie in with consumer needs. The idea that many financial incentives can be linked to this <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> was affirmed in a separate workshop.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a complexity measure of modal properties of finite structures which generalises the automaticity of languages. It {{is based on}} graph-automata like devices called <b>labelling</b> <b>systems.</b> We define {{a measure of the}} size of a structure that we call rank, and show that any modal property of structures can be approximated up to any fixed rankÒby a <b>labelling</b> <b>system.</b> The function that takes Òto the size of the smallest <b>labelling</b> <b>system</b> doing this is called the labelling index of the property. We demonstrate that this is a useful and fine-grained measure of complexity and show that it is especially well suited to characterise the expressive power of modal fixed-point logics. From this we derive several separation results of modal and non-modal fixed-point logics, some of which are already known whereas others are new. ...|$|R
