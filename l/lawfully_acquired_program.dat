5000|$|Whether {{or not the}} patents were <b>lawfully</b> <b>acquired</b> is immaterial, {{since they}} were {{employed}} to achieve an unlawful end. Answering Singer's position, the Government urges that the acquisition of [...] "Gegauf I" [...] was {{but one of the}} overt acts of the overall conspiracy which embraced all five patents, and that to grant relief only against the one patent is to leave the defendant free to employ the other four patents to accomplish the unlawful exclusion.|$|R

The government claimed that the parties entered into an agreement that had an identity of purpose and they took actions in pursuance of it that, in law, amount to a combination or conspiracy in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. [...] "There is no claim by the Government that it is illegal for one merely to acquire a patent in order to exclude his competitors; or that the owner of a <b>lawfully</b> <b>acquired</b> patent cannot use the patent laws to exclude all infringers of the patent; or that a licensee cannot <b>lawfully</b> <b>acquire</b> the covering patent in order better to enforce it on his own account, even when the patent dominates an industry in which the licensee is the dominant firm."

5000|$|On remand {{from the}} Supreme Court, the {{district}} court entered a decree regarding patent issues. The Government proposed a judgment that would enjoin the defendant Singer from enforcing all five of its patents that the Government argued were {{the subject of the}} conspiracy. Singer argued that the court should limit the decree to one patent alone (the [...] "Gegauf I" [...] patent), which Singer argued was the only patent involved in the conspiracy and to compulsory licensing of that patent at a reasonable royalty rather than, in effect, royalty-free licensing. Some of the patents were <b>lawfully</b> <b>acquired</b> but all five concerned zig-zag sewing machines, which were the subject of the conspiracy.
