25|$|RoboMary {{can examine}} the {{computer}} brain of similar non-color-locked robots {{when they look}} at a red tomato, and see exactly how they react and what kinds of impulses occur. RoboMary can also construct a simulation of her own brain, unlock the simulation's color-lock and, with reference to the other robots, simulate exactly how this simulation of herself reacts to seeing a red tomato. RoboMary naturally has control over all of her internal states except for the color-lock. With the knowledge of her simulation's internal states upon seeing a red tomato, RoboMary can put her own internal states directly into the states they would be in upon seeing a red tomato. In this way, without ever seeing a red tomato through her cameras, she will know exactly what it is <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> red tomato.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Mary's {{failure to}} learn exactly what seeing red feels like {{is simply a}} failure of language, or a failure {{of our ability to}} {{describe}} experiences. An alien race with a different method of communication or description might be perfectly able to teach their version of Mary exactly how seeing the color red would feel. Perhaps it is simply a uniquely human failing to communicate first-person experiences from a third-person perspective. Dennett suggests that the description might even be possible using English. He uses a simpler version of the Mary thought experiment to show how this might work. What if Mary was in a room without triangles and was prevented from seeing or making any triangles? An English-language description of just a few words would be sufficient for her to imagine what it is <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> triangle—she can simply and directly visualize a triangle in her mind. Similarly, Dennett proposes, it is perfectly, logically possible that the quale of {{what it is like to}} see red could eventually be described in an English-language description of millions or billions of words.|$|E

Although the sequel did not sell as well as the original, 3.96 million units versus 6.6 million units, it can still be considered a commercial success. As a result of the title's popularity, Yoshinori Kitase and Kazushige Nojima decided to establish a plot-related connection between Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy VII, another well-received Final Fantasy game.

500|$|On 19 September 1914, Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George stated {{publicly}} that he [...] "should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> Welsh Army in the field". This thought quickly picked up support from politicians and from Kitchener; a Welsh Army Corps of two divisions totalling 50,000 men was approved on 10 October. The recruits {{were to be}} drawn from Wales as well as Monmouthshire and from Welshmen living in Liverpool, London and Manchester. The creation of the corps soon became a source of dispute between Lloyd George and Kitchener and was never realised {{due to a lack of}} potential recruits. Llewelyn Wyn Griffith, an officer within the 38th (Welsh) Division, commented that [...] "the population of Wales was not sufficient to raise two full divisions and all the corps units required". By the end of 1914, it had been decided that only one division would be raised. The 10,000 men, who had since joined the Welsh Army Corps, were formed into the 43rd Division of Kitchener's Fifth New Army. The division comprised the 113th, 114th and 115th Brigades, and was made up of battalions from the Royal Welsh Fusiliers (RWF), the South Wales Borderers (SWB) and the Welsh Regiment (Welsh). On 19 January 1915, Major-General Ivor Philipps was assigned as the first divisional commander. By March, 20,000 men had been enlisted and over the coming months the first units reached full strength. Despite steady recruitment, by 30 June 1915, 20 per cent of recruits had been removed, having been discharged primarily for medical reasons or transferred to other units leaving 27,836 men within the ostensible Welsh Army Corps. The division was made up predominately of Welshmen, but it included soldiers from the rest of the United Kingdom and several other nations.|$|E

Gilly's immediate grief resulted in the characters name trending on Twitter, of this Quinlan stated: [...] "So glad that the ep had the impact that was desired! Buzzing Gilly is trended again!" [...] Gilly's grief is made worse because of Steph making the decision to die prematurely. Conversing this Quinlan said: [...] "He's grieving - he just can't understand why she took her life like that." [...] He added that Gilly's grief turns to anger because he cannot get the answers to his questions. Quinlan opined that he wanted Gilly to take a different root stating: [...] "I'd like to see Gilly go down a bit of a different route because he’s been a bit of a push-over in the past. I'd like to see his character progress a bit more and I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> side of him that we haven't seen before." [...] Gilly's grief then continued to get worse with Quinlan adding: [...] "The poor guy's heading off on a very dark journey that I'm sure he'll live to regret." [...] As Gilly is still so angry, at Steph's funeral, the director of the episode asked Quinlan not to cry at all during the ceremony.
