5|$|The Claimant was now bankrupt. In 1870 his {{new legal}} {{advisers}} launched a novel fundraising scheme: Tichborne Bonds, {{an issue of}} 1,000 debentures of £100 face value, the holders {{of which would be}} repaid with interest when the Claimant obtained his inheritance. About £40,000 was raised, though the bonds quickly traded at a considerable discount and were soon being exchanged for derisory sums. The scheme allowed the Claimant to continue to meet his living and <b>legal</b> <b>expenses</b> for a while. After a delay while the Franco-Prussian War and its aftermath prevented key witnesses from leaving Paris, the civil case that the Claimant hoped would confirm his identity finally came to court in May 1871.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Frusciante married Nicole Turley, drummer {{and lead}} vocalist of the {{experimental}} band Swahili Blonde. On May 8, 2015 {{it was announced that}} Turley had filed for divorce. On October 3, 2015, Turley announced that she was seeking $75,000 a month as part of their divorce settlement. According to court documents, Turley, who was already being paid $20,000 a month, needs a higher payment to maintain her quality of living. She claims her finances are down to only $30,000. Turley said that Frusciante was worth $14 million and she was entitled to more money saying that together the couple employed a team of personal assistants, and owned three homes and a private music studio. A week later Frusciante responded to Turley's demands saying that he refuses to pay her any more money and that she is also seeking $2,600 a month for gifts and expenses for her adult brother. He also said he was done footing the bill for her musical career saying “I don’t know if you can call her recording efforts a hobby or a past-time … but it seems improper to characterize Nicole as a professional musician.” On October 19, 2015, a judge ruled in favor of Turley saying Frusciante had to pay his former wife $53,000 a month. Frusciante was also forced to pay $71,000 for Turley's <b>legal</b> <b>expenses.</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction. In this chapter, we {{will provide}} an {{overview}} of the economic literature regarding cost shifting, fee arrangements and <b>legal</b> <b>expense</b> insurance. In the economic analysis of law, legal rules are regarded as instruments which can provide actors with behavioural incentives. In essence, private law (torts, contracts, property, etc.) allocates the costs which arise out of different activities. Those costs may only be borne by the party causing them if the party initially suff ering from them brings suit. Problems in fi nancing civil litigation may eff ectively hinder such lawsuits, so that the behavioural incentives which the law intends to provide do not reach the party causing the harm.

25|$|The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{set up the}} National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) in 1988 to {{compensate}} individuals and families of individuals injured by covered childhood vaccines. The VICP was adopted in response to concerns over the pertussis portion of the DPT vaccine. Several U.S. lawsuits against vaccine makers won substantial awards. Most makers ceased production, and the last remaining major manufacturer threatened to do so. The VICP uses a no-fault system for resolving vaccine injury claims. Compensation covers medical and <b>legal</b> <b>expenses,</b> loss of future earning capacity, and up to $250,000 for pain and suffering; a death benefit of up to $250,000 is available. If certain minimal requirements are met, <b>legal</b> <b>expenses</b> are compensated even for unsuccessful claims. Since 1988, {{the program has been}} funded by an excise tax of 75 cents on every purchased dose of covered vaccine. To win an award, a claimant must have experienced an injury that is named as a vaccine injury in a table included in the law within the required time period or show a causal connection. The burden of proof is the civil law preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, in other words a showing that causation was more likely than not. Denied claims can be pursued in civil courts, though this is rare.|$|E
40|$|A major {{center of}} {{controversy}} and litigation in the West {{today is the}} issue of Federal reserved water rights for Indian tribes. The Gila River Indian Community has claimed an early priority to all appropriable water in the San Pedro basin. The time, <b>legal</b> <b>expense,</b> and the uncertain outcome of adjudication create incentive for involved parties to reach a negotiated solution to the conflict. An analysis of this conflict reveals much higher economic returns to San Pedro River water in the San Pedro basin than at the Gila River Indian Reservation, due largely to loss of water in transport down river. The existence of divergence of economic returns presents the possibility of negotiating a settlement to the conflict. Negotiation for water rights presumes and is critically dependant upon ability to transfer those rights. Non marketability of Indian water rights maximizes the potential damage to non-Indian water users...|$|R
40|$|Following a 2003 U. S. Supreme Court decision, {{employers}} {{face the}} prospect of fighting employment discrimination cases that they cannot afford to win. A decision involving Caesars Palace held that based on a 1991 federal statute, a complaining employee need not give direct evidence of discrimination as part of the complaint. This is a change in the treatment formerly given to the so-called mixed motive concept, in which a personnel decision regarding an employee who is part of a protected class may be motivated by both legitimate business considerations and discrimination. In addition to apparently shifting the burden of proof, the federal law provides for jury trials in discrimination complaints. Because such trials involve considerable <b>legal</b> <b>expense,</b> employers who choose to litigate such cases may “win” but be impoverished by the resulting legal bills. The concern in such a situation is that employers may find themselves subject to inappropriate discrimination suits...|$|R
40|$|Before {{considering}} {{in detail}} {{that portion of}} the cost of a Civil Engineering project associated with the employment of a contractor, one should take an overall look at the total cost of an average project.

Although the trial {{had been scheduled to}} last two weeks, the prosecution dropped the charges after four days. No reason for dropping the charges was officially given, although the government's case was considerably weakened by expert witnesses employed by Neidorf and Zenner. John Nagle, an independent computer scientist, and Dorothy Denning, a computer security expert, testified for the defense that the text file stolen from BellSouth, as published by Neidorf, actually contained nothing of value for breaking into systems. The defense was also able to demonstrate that the file which the government had alleged was both highly valuable and highly proprietary was actually neither. Nagle demonstrated that more damaging information about BellSouth's 911 system was already publicly available, and Zenner demonstrated that the exact file in question, unedited, could be obtained by calling BellSouth and ordering manuals which cost either $13 or $21. Neidorf ultimately received no conviction, although he did incur <b>legal</b> <b>expense</b> in excess of $100,000.|$|R
5000|$|Acuff-Rose Music was {{involved}} in a landmark copyright infringement case in the 1990s: Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. (510 U.S. 569; 1994). In dispute was the use by rap artist Luther Campbell (then using the alias [...] "Luke Skyywalker") and his band 2 Live Crew of a substantial amount of the Roy Orbison hit song [...] "Oh, Pretty Woman" [...] in a parody. Claiming their version of the song fell under the fair use doctrine of the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. 107, Campbell prevailed in the United States district court in Nashville. However, this was reversed at the appellate level by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The case was argued before the United States Supreme Court on November 9, 1993. Handing down its ruling on March 7, 1994, the court held that the appellate court placed too much emphasis on the commercial nature of the parody. The opinion of the appellate court was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings. [...] Subsequently, the parties agreed to settle the case to avoid further <b>legal</b> <b>expense.</b>|$|R

[...] After a huge <b>legal</b> <b>expense</b> to get his company back, and the ban on surrogacy in India that impacted close to 20 of his clients, Rudy worked with several vendors in Mexico and then attempted to purchase his own clinic in Cancun.
