5000|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{planning}} and oversight and the carelessness of workmen during the renovation of the Boardwalk Hall, much damage was done to the organ. Pipes were removed, bent, and stepped on. (Organ pipes are made from soft alloys based on lead, so {{it is very easy}} to dent or crush them.) Windlines to various pipe chambers were cut, with no effort to identify the lines, nor any plans to re-route or repair them. The relay for the <b>left</b> <b>stage</b> chamber was cut out without regard to its restoration, and various switching and control cables were cut. The 5-manual console connection was cut. Cement dust disrupted the switching contacts, magnets and the organ pipes. All this left the entire organ damaged and the Right Stage chamber, which was 98% operational in 1998, was completely disabled. The relay of the Ballroom Organ was also removed in a careless way, which rendered that organ unplayable as well. It has currently been returned to service and is now featured in an annual silent film series ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{the scene}} opens, robins chirp in the {{background}} and the music fades. The father of the family, John, is sitting in a wooden rocking chair inside his home. On his right, his dog Rover is happily lying on the floor. John tells guests that it is [...] "right {{around the turn of the}} century" [...] and also that it is Valentine’s Day. He then claims that things could not get any better than they are at that time, before giving a list of the new inventions and technological achievements of the day. These include: buildings being up to 20 stories tall, moving pictures (movies), 8,000 automobiles in the United States, and such technology as gas lamps, telephones, cast-iron stoves, iceboxes, a reservoir which keeps 5 buckets of water warm, with three buckets of coal, and a water pump in the kitchen. As John highlights the new pieces of technology, a spotlight shines on them and they begin to work. He then comments that problems such as chopping wood, sour milk and having to get water from a well are all things of the past. After he is done showing off the new technology, he calls to his wife, Sarah, who is ironing in the room to his left with their young daughter. The two discuss how Thomas Edison is working on an idea for [...] "snap-on electric lights". Sarah then says that will mean no more kerosene and no more gas. She also shows guests her new [...] "wash-day marvel" [...] and comments that now she can do the laundry in five hours instead of two days! As John is explaining that Sarah now has time for other things, he is cut off by her response of [...] "Such as canning and cleaning the oven?" [...] Sarah then excuses herself, commenting that she needs to get the laundry off the line before it starts raining cats and dogs (which makes Rover bark). After it begins to rain, the family's son begins to talk from the right room. The son's name is James and he is scolded for using his father’s Stereoscope without permission. James is watching Little Egypt dancing the [...] "Hootchie-Cootchie". John comments that she is going to be the star of the upcoming World's Fair, and that James better put the Stereoscope away before his mother finds it. The upcoming World's Fair is a reference to the 1906 World's Fair in St. Louis, which has led many to conclude that the scene guests are watching takes place on Valentine’s Day 1906 (although this is unconfirmed). As John and James finish talking, John tells guests that they also have [...] "one of those new talking machines". The <b>left</b> <b>stage</b> then shows the family’s grandmother, sleeping with the radio on. The radio plays [...] "There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow", and the grandmother’s parrot exclaims [...] "She keeps that thing on all day!” John's attention is then drawn to a room on the right, where his daughter Patricia is. Patricia is getting ready to go to a Valentine’s Day dance on the other side of town. John explains that she will be taking one of the new [...] "horseless trolleys", before telling her that she better be home by 9 o'clock. He then tells guests that he is going to take one of the new trolleys downtown to have a root beer (which he explains is just a sarsaparilla with a new name). After he is finished, he begins singing [...] "There's A Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow" [...] and the Carousel spins, moving guests to the next scene, which takes place in the 1920s during the 4th of July.|$|E

40|$|This study {{develops}} a conceptualisation {{of the political}} cultures of the Chilean Socialist Party (PSCh) {{in order to understand}} and develop an explanation of the nomination of Michelle Bachelet as presidential candidate in 2005 which avoids the oversimplifications of existing approaches. At the theoretical level, political culture is defined from the collective action perspective conceptualising it as a framework for action (Elkin, 1993 : 123). This political culture is formed by patterns for political participation which drive internal power relations between members and leaders. The formation of these patterns is influenced by their social context which is mediated by groups of members and leaders in relation to their histories, experiences of critical historical junctures and ideological heritages. The conceptualisation developed thus links structure and agency in a way that enables a nuanced analysis of inter-party power relationships and agency. This fosters a deeper explanation of Bachelet’s nomination and enables evaluation of its meaning for the party as an institution. It also help us to understand internal dynamics and contradictions than could be found in her nomination. I argue that the PSCh has historically had two political cultures whose relative balance of power within the party has shifted over time. The first which I name the institutional pattern is a normative pattern which frames political participation as libertarian, democratic and pluralistic. Currently it is the non-dominant political culture {{to be found in the}} party bases. The second is the dominant party political culture which I name the practice pattern. This frames relationships between members and leaders from the perspective of co-optation, authoritarianism and hegemony over decision-making. The formation of these political cultures has been influenced by the Chilean social context during three stages of party institutional development: Foundational (1933 - 1956), the New Left (1956 - 1979), and Socialist Renewal (1979 - 2005). The first political culture represented in the institutional pattern is formed during the Foundational stage, where political participation is based on Pizzorno’s system of solidarity and collective identification. The second political culture, represented by the practice pattern integrated ideas about discipline and obedience presented in the New <b>Left</b> <b>stage</b> but is reinforced during the Socialist Renewal stage, when participation shifted to Pizzorno’s system of interest and individual goals. These two political cultures define and delimit participation within the party, which is highly individualised. Membership and leadership participation is settled between factions, but also results in the presence of informal types of membership and leadership within the party. Factional membership and leadership is the attribute which legitimises a subject as party member. In Bachelet’s case, her persona brings together these two cultures, despite increasing tensions between excluded sectors in the base and leadership of the party and the hegemonic leadership. The first institutional pattern played to an idea that her candidacy and nomination represented the inclusion of historical members as part of pluralism and democracy. The discontented base membership linked her persona with this pattern and supported her. However, as a faction leader and mandatario she also reinforced the elitist and hegemonic 'practice pattern' of participation, which resulted in strong disciplinary relationships coming from the faction’s elite in order to secure her nomination. As a result, the elitist practice pattern was deepened due to the strengthening of authoritarianism, co-optation and hegemony within the party. This then helps us understand the fragility of party unity in support of her candidacy and the subsequent division of the party in 2010 when a coalition of the right was elected to power...|$|E
