The paper {{provides an example of}} a mapping method and a database that will add to the existing online sources of information and analysis offered by nongovernmental agencies and some government departments. This project contributes to the general aim of many citizen groups to <b>limit,</b> <b>monitor</b> and regulate the practices of hydropower companies and the management of their infrastructure in the GBM. The monitoring pressure from citizen groups and science projects continues to serve as an important replacement to the weak functioning of the country environment ministries and corrects the corruptions of the license raj that plaque project deals and environmental clearances. These citizen motivated knowledge exchanges, especially through online portals and social media, can even push for better transnational instruments for formal governmental data sharing...|$|E

The model explains the association between <b>limited</b> <b>monitoring</b> and CEO pay practices such as pay-for-luck, high salaries, a low pay-performance sensitivity, and a more asymmetric pay-for-performance relation. The results are driven by the matching equilibrium: firms with different capacities for monitoring hire different types of CEOs and offer different compensation contracts.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the question of}} tacit collusion in repeated auctions with independent private values and with <b>limited</b> public <b>monitoring.</b> McAfee and McMillan show that the extent of collusion is tied to availability of transfers. Monetary transfers allow cartels to extract full surplus. A folk theorem proved by Fudenberg at al. shows that transfers of future payoffs are almost as good if players are patient and communicate before auctions. We ask how the scope of collusion is affected if players dispense with explicit communication. Collusion better than bid rotation is still feasible, but full surplus cannot be extracted. This constraint becomes less severe with more players and large cartels can become asymptotically efficient even with very <b>limited</b> <b>monitoring.</b> (This paper is a revise...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Complexity of the reviews, overly broad guidance, and <b>limited</b> <b>monitoring</b> for consistency impeded {{the ability of the}} Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) to achieve the goals of the foreclosure review [...] to identify as many harmed borrowers as possible and ensure similar results for similarly situated borrowers. Regulators said that coordinating among foreclosure review participants was challenging, and consultants said that the reviews were complex. In spite of regulators' steps to foster consistency, broad guidance and <b>limited</b> <b>monitoring</b> reduced the potential usefulness of data from consultants and increased risks of inconsistency. For example, GAO found that guidance was revised throughout the process, resulting in delays. Other guidance did not specify key sampling parameters for the file reviews and regulators lacked objective monitoring measures, resulting in difficulty assessing the extent of borrower harm. Good planning and collecting objective data during monitoring provide a basis for making sound conclusions. Without using objective measures to assess sampling or comparing review methods across consultants, regulators' ability to monitor progress toward achievement of foreclosure review goals was hindered. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{addresses}} a novel problem of maintaining channel profiles on the Web. Such channel maintenance {{is essential for}} next generation of Web 2. 0 applications that provide sophisticated search and discovery services over Web information channels. Maintaining a fresh channel profile is extremely difficult due to the the dynamic nature of the channel, especially under the constraint of a <b>limited</b> <b>monitoring</b> budget. We propose a novel monitoring scheme that learns the channels’ monitoring rates. The monitoring scheme is further extended to consider the content that is published on the channels. We describe a novelty detection filter that refines the monitoring rate according to the expected rate of novel content published on the channels. We further show how inter-channel profile similarities can be utilized to refine the channel monitoring rates. Using real-world data of Web feeds we study {{the performance of the}} monitoring scheme. We experiment with several monitoring policies over a large set of Web feeds and show that a policy based on learning the monitoring rate of the channels, combined with novelty detection, outperforms alternative channel monitoring policies. Our results show that the suggested content-based policy is able to maintain high quality channel profiles under <b>limited</b> <b>monitoring</b> resources...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{a unique}} traffic law {{enforcement}} campaign in Germany {{and its impact}} on road safety. Key features of the campaign are (1) repeated one-day lasting massive speed <b>limit</b> <b>monitoring</b> (so called Blitzmarathons) and (2) a media campaign that informs the public in advance about the timing, extent, and purpose of the speed <b>limit</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Using administrative records on all police reported vehicle crashes in Germany from 2011 to 2014 and generalized difference-indifferences estimations, we find an eight percent {{reduction in the number of}} traffic accidents and a nine percent reduction in the number of slightly injured during Blitzmarathon-day compared to regular days. The effect begins to emerge with the onset of the media campaign, one to three days before a Blitzmarathon. However, while the initiators of the Blitzmarathons intended a permanent change in road safety, we do not find that the reduction in traffic accidents persists beyond a Blitzmarathon-day. In terms of mechanisms, we show that a substitution of traffic from motorized vehicles to other modes of transport not targeted by the Blitzmarathons does not drive our results, and we demonstrate that overall driving speed is lower during a Blitzmarathon-day compared to other days. Given the general relevance of traffic law enforcement strategies, our result have important implications for policy makers beyond the German context...|$|R

Moreover, improvements in the monitoring capacity of the worst firms increase competition for CEOs and raise CEO pay in all firms...|$|R
