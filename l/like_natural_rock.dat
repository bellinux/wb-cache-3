5|$|Catherine's {{earliest}} {{building project}} was the château of Montceaux-en-Brie, near Paris, which Henry II gave her in 1556, {{three years before}} his death. The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight staircase, and two wings with a pavilion at each end. Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played pall mall, an early form of croquet. For this commission, Philibert de l'Orme built her a grotto. He set it on a base made to look <b>like</b> <b>natural</b> <b>rock,</b> from which guests could watch the games while taking refreshments. The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived. The château ceased {{to be used as}} a royal residence after 1640, and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798.|$|E
50|$|Gilbert Stanley Underwood was {{employed}} by the Union Pacific Railroad to design resort hotels at Zion, Bryce Canyon, Yosemite, and Grand Canyon. Underwood purposefully designed the stonework to appear <b>like</b> <b>natural</b> <b>rock</b> outcroppings. The main lodge building is set slightly downhill {{into the side of}} the canyon and is the complex's central feature. The structure of both the original and rebuilt lodges is a mixture of Kaibab limestone and peeled Ponderosa pine logs.|$|E
50|$|The lower garden also {{contains}} two large rustic fountains, called the Mete, {{located on the}} northwest corner of the garden near the entrance. They were designed to look <b>like</b> <b>natural</b> <b>rock,</b> with grottos and niches. Created in 1568-1569, they were made by Tomasso da Como, and were originally intended to feature two large statues of giants, the guardians of the garden. A smaller rustic fountain, called the Fontana Rustca dell'Inverno, holds a 16th-century statue of Winter that originally was in the Gran Loggia.|$|E
5000|$|The castle is {{surrounded}} by a steep rock and streams from three sides, and looks <b>like</b> a <b>natural</b> <b>rock</b> relief. The only entrance to the castle is from the gates on the north-eastern edge. The internal length of the castle is 90 m, and its width is 35 to 40 m. The internal castle is in the higher south-western corner. The average thickness of the walls of Lekh Castle is 1.3 m. There are water wells 3 to 5 m deep that were used for storage and cooling of food and as a source of drinking water. Nowadays, the walls are in ruins. Around Lekh Castle, there are other smaller satellite castles on surrounding mountain peaks such as Garavul (“Guard”) and Jomard castles. Close to the Lekh Castle there are two caves where archeologist found items testifying of early presence of human beings.|$|R
5000|$|Hermits Rest {{stands a}} few feet from the rim of the Grand Canyon, partly buried in an earth mound. The exposed {{portions}} of the structure are designed to look <b>like</b> a <b>natural</b> <b>rock</b> formation, apart from the prominent rubblestone chimney. The structure is approached by a path that passes (and originally ran through) a stone arch decorated with a broken bell that Colter salvaged from a Spanish mission in New Mexico. A small porch supported by peeled log posts stands to one side of the outside observation area that overlooks the canyon rim. The low porch roof extends into the interior, which opens up to a double-height space. Opposite the entry, the south wall houses a semi-circular alcove with a fireplace and a raised floor. A snack bar opens on the west side of the space, and the [...] "rug room," [...] where native crafts were sold, is on the east side with its own fireplace. The interior furnishings throughout were chosen by Colter and are part of the historic designation. The overall impression imparted by Colter's design is one of antiquity. Colter, when kidded by AT&SF executives about the dark, antique-looking interior, retorted [...] "you can't imagine what it cost to make it look this old." ...|$|R
40|$|Analcime and {{clinoptilolite}} {{are among}} the most abundant zeolites in nature. During recent decades natural analcimes and clinoptilolites, also synthetic modified analcimes have been investigated as potential and innovative substances, possible to use for the immobilization of radioactive waste, molecular catalysis and other purposes. However, <b>natural</b> analcimes <b>like</b> many <b>natural</b> <b>rocks</b> are contamined with various impurities (about 30  %), which significally reduces their sorption possibilities and possibilities of their using in such chemical technologies as catalysis, fractioning of hydrocarbons and other. In this article the stability of cubic analcime at the hydrothermal conditions at 180  °C temperature in solutions of various concentrations, containing Li +, Mg 2 +, Sr 2 + and Fe 3 + ions has been examined. These processes have big signification for the formation of ion-exchanged analcimes, its sorption properties and also if ions have been immobilized in analcime structure. It has been established, that as result of interaction between cubic analcime and lithium chloride solutions the formation of new compounds: lithium silicate and silinaite occurs. At the same hydrothermal conditions the interaction between cubic analcime and chloride solutions, containing Sr 2 +, Mg 2 + and Fe 3 + ions pass without formation of new compounds, and only with interposition of these ions in the structure of cubic analcime.

50|$|Montceaux {{is known}} for the former château, which Henri II gave to Catherine de' Medici in 1556, was her {{earliest}} building project. The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight staircase, and two wings with a pavilion at each end. Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played pall-mall, an early form of croquet. For this commission, Philibert de l'Orme built her a grotto set on a base made to look <b>like</b> <b>natural</b> <b>rock,</b> from which guests could watch the games while taking refreshments. The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived. Given by Henri IV to Marie de' Medici, the château ceased {{to be used as}} a royal residence after 1640, and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798. Some ruins remain, a chapel and the buildings of the forecourt, transformed into private dwellings; parts of the east wing are farm buildings.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} model nonstationary {{real-world}} processes {{one can find}} appropriate theoretical model with properties following the analyzed data. However in this case many trajectories of the analyzed process are required. Alternatively, one can extract parts of the signal that have homogenous structure via segmentation. The proper segmentation can lead to extraction of important features of analyzed phenomena that cannot be described without the segmentation. There is no one universal method {{that can be applied}} for all of the phenomena; thus novel methods should be invented for specific cases. They might address specific character of the signal in different domains (time, frequency, time-frequency, etc.). In this paper we propose two novel segmentation methods that take under consideration the stochastic properties of the analyzed signals in time domain. Our research is motivated by the analysis of vibration signals acquired in an underground mine. In such signals we observe seismic events which appear after the mining activity, like blasting, provoked relaxation of rock, and some unexpected events, <b>like</b> <b>natural</b> <b>rock</b> burst. The proposed segmentation procedures allow for extraction of such parts of the analyzed signals which are related to mentioned events...|$|E
60|$|In the {{openings}} {{of the wood}} there are fountains plashing into marble basins, the depths of which are shaggy with water-weeds; or they tumble <b>like</b> <b>natural</b> cascades from <b>rock</b> to rock, sending their murmur afar, to make the quiet and silence more appreciable. Scattered here and there with careless artifice, stand old altars bearing Roman inscriptions. Statues, gray with the long corrosion of even that soft atmosphere, half hide and half reveal themselves, high on pedestals, or perhaps fallen and broken on the turf. Terminal figures, columns of marble or granite porticos, arches, are seen in the vistas of the wood-paths, either veritable relics of antiquity, or with so exquisite a touch of artful ruin on {{them that they are}} better than if really antique. At all events, grass grows on the tops of the shattered pillars, and weeds and flowers root themselves in the chinks of the massive arches and fronts of temples, and clamber at large over their pediments, as if this were the thousandth summer since their winged seeds alighted there.|$|R
40|$|Because {{marble and}} <b>natural</b> <b>rocks</b> {{have been used}} widely for {{ornamental}} purposes, rubbing-polishing process also became important. One of the factors determining the quality of <b>natural</b> <b>rocks</b> is surface polish. The degree of surface polish is determined by qualitative definitions based on experiences in the plants <b>natural</b> <b>rocks</b> are processed. In this study, a digital image analysis based surface polish measurement system which measures surface polish systematically was developed and its validity and suitability were investigated by making experiments on a <b>natural</b> <b>rock</b> sample...|$|R
