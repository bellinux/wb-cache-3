5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his <b>long</b> <b>nose,</b> dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. This fact {{is reinforced by the}} clock placed on the table beside him, which serves both as a memento mori and a reminder that time is running out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E

25|$|The High1 mascot is a {{large white}} dog that stands upright. It has long white ears and wears a blank High1 away jersey. The mascot also wears a gray winter hat and pair of gloves. In printed media the mascot is often shown wearing {{protective}} glasses, but the actual mascot doesn't wear them. It has two small eyes, a <b>long</b> <b>nose,</b> but no discernible mouth.|$|E
25|$|The 1963 Sting Ray {{production}} car's lineage can {{be traced}} to two separate GM projects: the Q-Corvette, and perhaps more directly, Mitchell's racing Sting Ray. The Q-Corvette, initiated in 1957, envisioned a smaller, more advanced Corvette as a coupe-only model, boasting a rear transaxle, independent rear suspension, and four-wheel disc brakes, with the rear brakes mounted inboard. Exterior styling was purposeful, with peaked fenders, a <b>long</b> <b>nose,</b> and a short, bobbed tail.|$|E

Fernão Mendes is shown with unusual fluffy whiskers and beard like the wings spread on his chest. European facial features include a <b>long</b> <b>nose,</b> round eyes, textured cheekbones, high forehead and pear-shaped skull. He is depicted as tall, round-shouldered and thin in a naturalistic way. His long frock shows European buttons.|$|E
25|$|The Delta 2 {{featured}} a cylindrical cross-section fuselage, {{the diameter of}} which having been specifically dimensioned for the Avon engine, which smoothly flowed into a lengthy tapered nose. The <b>long</b> <b>nose</b> which would normally have obscured the pilot's forward vision during landing, take-off and movement on the ground; however, the Delta 2 could compensate for this, providing adequate visibility via the innovation of a droop-nose; accordingly, the nose section and cockpit could be drooped 10° via a hydraulically-actuated mechanism, {{in a similar manner}} to that which was used later on Concorde.|$|E

25|$|The C.205 was a single-seat, all-metal, {{monoplane}} fighter, {{intended primarily}} as an interceptor but with ground attack and escort capabilities. The <b>long</b> <b>nose</b> housed the DB605 engine which drove a three-blade, constant-speed metal propeller, {{with the main}} fuel tank situated between the engine and the cockpit. The radiator was located under the centre section of the fuselage beneath the cockpit while the short rear section housed the radio equipment, oxygen cylinder and an 80L (20US gal) reserve fuel tank. The wings were made of light aluminium alloys and steel, having two spars and three sections, housing two additional fuel tanks, and the fully retractable wide-set main undercarriage gear. Apart from the all-metal flaps in the inner wing, all the other control surfaces were metal-framed and fabric-covered. Veltros had self-sealing fuel tanks, an armoured seat, and armoured windscreen as standard. The cramped cockpit possessed a limited field-of-view, but some examples were fitted with a rear-view mirror.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{structure was}} unusual and innovative, being {{based on a}} strong central keel that incorporated the armament, cockpit, and engine. Two strong fuselage beams to port and starboard {{formed the basis of}} the structure. These angled upwards fore and aft to create mounting points for the T9 cannon and propeller reduction gearbox and for the engine and accessories respectively. A strong arched bulkhead provided the main structural attachment point for the main spar of the wing. This arch incorporated a fireproof panel and an armor plate between the engine and the cockpit. It also incorporated a turnover pylon and a pane of bullet-resistant glass behind the pilot's head. The arch also formed the basis of the cockpit housing; the pilot's seat was attached to the forward face as was the cockpit floor. Forward of the cockpit the fuselage nose was formed from large removable covers. A <b>long</b> <b>nose</b> wheel well was incorporated in the lower nose section. The engine and accessories were attached {{to the rear of the}} arch and the main structural beams; these too were covered using large removable panels. A conventional semi-monocoque rear fuselage was attached aft of the main structure.|$|E

500|$|The tengu in art {{appears in}} a variety of shapes. [...] It usually falls somewhere between a large, monstrous bird and a wholly anthropomorphized being, often with a red face or an unusually large or <b>long</b> <b>nose.</b> Early depictions of tengu show them as kite-like beings who can take a human-like form, often {{retaining}} avian wings, head or beak. The tengu's <b>long</b> <b>nose</b> seems to have been conceived in the 14th century, likely as a humanization of the original bird's bill. This feature allies them with the Shinto deity Sarutahiko, who is described in the Japanese historical text the Nihon Shoki with a similar nose measuring seven hand-spans in length. [...] In village festivals the two figures are often portrayed with identical red, phallic-nosed mask designs.|$|E

Although they take their name from a dog-like [...] Chinese demon (Tiangou), the tengu were originally thought to take the forms of birds of prey, and they are traditionally depicted with both human and avian characteristics. The earliest tengu were pictured with beaks, but this feature has often been humanized as an unnaturally <b>long</b> <b>nose,</b> which today is widely considered the tengus defining characteristic in the popular imagination.|$|E
500|$|A later {{version of}} the Kujiki, an ancient Japanese {{historical}} text, writes the name of Amanozako, a monstrous female deity born from the god Susanoo's spat-out ferocity, with characters meaning tengu deity (...) [...] The book describes Amanozako as a raging creature capable of flight, with {{the body of a}} human, the head of a beast, a <b>long</b> <b>nose,</b> long ears, and long teeth that can chew through swords. An 18th-century book called the [...] suggests that this goddess may be the true predecessor of the tengu, but the date and authenticity of the Kujiki, and of that edition in particular, remain disputed.|$|E

500|$|Cosima and Blandine {{remained}} with Anna Liszt until 1850, joined eventually by Daniel. Cosima's biographer George Marek describes Anna as [...] "a simple, uneducated, unworldly but warmhearted woman ... {{for the first}} time [...] experienced what it was to be touched by love". Of the sisters, Blandine was evidently the prettier; Cosima, with her <b>long</b> <b>nose</b> and wide mouth was described as an [...] "ugly duckling". Although Liszt's relations with his children were formal and distant, he provided for them liberally, and ensured that they were well educated. Both girls were sent to Madame Bernard's, an exclusive boarding school, while Daniel was prepared for the prestigious Lycée Bonaparte.|$|E
500|$|American {{ichthyologist}} David Starr Jordan {{described the}} goblin shark in an 1898 issue of Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences, recognizing the peculiar fish {{not only as}} a new species, but also a new genus and family. He based his account on an immature male [...] long caught in Sagami Bay near Yokohama, Japan. The specimen had been acquired by shipmaster and naturalist Alan Owston, who had given it to Professor Kakichi Mitsukuri at the University of Tokyo, who in turn had brought it to Jordan. Thus, Jordan named the shark Mitsukurina owstoni in honor of these two men. The common name [...] "goblin shark" [...] is a translation of its old Japanese name tenguzame, a tengu being a Japanese mythical creature often depicted with a <b>long</b> <b>nose</b> and red face. Another name for this species is elfin shark.|$|E
500|$|The {{manuscript}} of Serat Rerenggan mentions {{the story of}} Demang Tegis, a Portuguese man said {{to be one of}} the architect of Taman Sari. According to the manuscript, a strange man suddenly appeared in Mancingan Village (a locality name on the south coast of Java near Parangtritis). With <b>long</b> <b>nose,</b> white complexion, and a foreign language, the villagers suspected that the person was some kind of spirit or forest fairy. They presented him to the current sultan, Hamengkubuwono II. Apparently the sultan found interest in the person and took the strange man as his servant. Some years had passed and the man had finally learned to talk in Javanese. According to him, he was a Portuguese (or in Javanese, Portegis) who was stranded from a shipwreck. He also claimed to have been a housebuilder, so the sultan ordered him to erect a fortress. Satisfied by the man’s work, the sultan gave him the title [...] "demang." [...] From then on that person was known as Demang Portegis or Demang Tegis.|$|E
