Specifically, emphasis is placed upon disentangling the effect of overusing chemical inputs {{and that of the}} market determinants. Taking into account both production and price uncertainty, the expected utility maximization criterion explicitly incorporating damage control function of pesticides is used to determine farmers' rational demand of chemical inputs. The actual use of chemical inputs and the theoretical use consistent with expected utility maximization are used to establish an overusing index, which later is incorporated into the dual cost function to examine the productivity consequences of overusing chemicals. Simulation analyses of various policy scenarios suggest the positive impact of <b>low-input</b> <b>farming.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of farming type (conventional or organic) and production system (low-and high-input) on various quality characteristics of milk {{have been in}} the focus of studies over the last decade. The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of different dairy management and production systems on carbon stable isotopes ratio (δ 13 C) and milk urea content. The samples of raw milk were collected each two weeks at certified organic high-input and <b>low-input</b> <b>farms,</b> conventional high-input and <b>low-input</b> <b>farms</b> in late indoor period and outdoor period. Data analysis showed clear difference between milk from organic high- and <b>low-input</b> <b>farms</b> with non-overlapping range between - 22. 90 ‰ and - 24. 70 ‰ for δ 13 С in protein fraction (equal 1. 80 ‰) and between - 25. 90 ‰ and - 28. 20 ‰ (equal 2. 30 ‰) for δ 13 С in fat fraction independently from season factor, as for Δδ 13 С (protein-fat) values in milk from high-input (1. 50 - 3. 00 ‰) and low-input (3. 20 - 6. 30 ‰) organic farms. Analysis of correlation between δ 13 С in protein fraction and milk urea content values showed that during late indoor period the most significant difference was detected between milk from organic low-input and conventional high-input farms (5. 85 ‰ for δ 13 С in protein fraction and 4. 65 mg/ 100 g of milk urea content). During outdoor period, the non-overlapping range was established for low-input and high-input organic farms (3. 40 ‰ for δ 13 С in protein fraction and 10. 77 mg/ 100 g of milk urea content).

40|$|Low-input {{agriculture}} is dominant farming style in {{majority of the}} Central and East European (CEE) countries. However, the shift from high-input agriculture as practised during the communist time to the present <b>low-input</b> <b>farming</b> was {{not the result of}} a designed policy for agricultural development but rather the consequence of a socio-political evolution from state economy to market economy. Ten years after the transition, the agricultural policies of most Central and East European countries are still at the “crossroad”. They are characterised by a diversity of visions on the further development and concepts how to implement these visions. The agri-environmental component of the current CEE’s agricultural policies either doesn’t exist or is rather vague and underdeveloped. Most of the CEE countries still aim at restoring agri-chemical inputs to the pre 1990 level. The <b>low-input</b> <b>farming</b> is not necessarily environmentally friendly since it often doesn’t pay sufficient attention to the environmental degradations caused by agricultural operations. This type of farming too can lead to severe soil erosion, declining biodiversity and building up of pests and diseases. Besides, the <b>low-input</b> <b>farming</b> is often not economically viable. To enable development of environmentally friendly agriculture in CEE countries, a three-track policy approach is suggested. Its measures should: 1. 	improve environmental and economic performance of the current low-input agriculture; 2. 	promote further development of pioneering organic agriculture, and 3. 	convert the remaining high-external-input regime to integrated agriculture. A mix of policy instruments (regulative, economic, informative, institutional and voluntary) should be put in place to facilitate further development of this three-track policy. The calculation from a recently finished Phare project in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania suggests that a tree-track policy approach make an interesting policy option both from the economic and environmental point of view.

There were two <b>low-input</b> <b>farming</b> systems (organic and bio-dynamic) and two high-input (conventional) farming systems (according to Swiss guidelines of integrated plant production with and without farmyard manure). The systems had an identical 7 -year crop rotation and tillage scheme and differed essentially only in the amount and type of fertilizer supplied and in plant protection management. The percentage of root colonization by AM fungi was determined in field samples 2 – 3 times over the growing season in crops in the rotation, namely in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Sardona), vetch-rye and grassclover. We found the percentage of root length colonized by AM fungi to be 30 – 60 % higher (P^ 0. 05) in the plants grown in soils from the <b>low-input</b> <b>farming</b> systems than in those grown in conventionally farmed soils. Approximately 50 % of the variation of AM root colonization was explained by chemical properties of the soils (pH, soluble P and K, exchangeable Mg), the effect of soluble soil P being most pronounced. The potential of the field soils from the differently managed plots to cause symbiosis with AM fungi was tested in a glasshouse experiment, using wheat as a host plant. Soils from the <b>low-input</b> <b>farming</b> systems had a greatly enhanced capacity to initiate AM symbiosis.

This review examines the literature from temperate regions, {{with a particular}} emphasison Canadian and USstudies that relate to environmental and ecological impacts of {{organic agriculture}} with respect to (i) soil organic matter storage, (ii) soil quality/soil health, (iii) nutrient loading and risks of off-farm nutrient and agrochemical losses, (iv) biodiversity and (v) energy use and global warming potential. The context and implications of semi-arid conditions and low soil P levels, common to many organic farms in North America, and wide spread adoption of genetically engineered crops in conventional production, is also considered. The consensus of the data available to date indicates the distinctiveness of cropping, flora and habitat diversity, soil management regime, nutrient intensity and use efficiency and energy, and pesticide use in organic farming confer important environmental and ecological benefits. These include maintenance of soil organic matter and added return of carbon to soil, improved soil health, reduced off-farm nitrogen and phosphorus losses, enhanced vegetative and wildlife (bird) biological diversity, extended some times to other taxa depending on landscape context, improved support for pollinators and pollination and reduced energy use and improved energy efficiency.

40|$|Poor yields in <b>low-input</b> <b>farms</b> {{and high}} {{fertilizer}} and environmental costs in high-input farms {{call for more}} efficient use of phosphorus (P) in rice systems. One approach to increasing the P efficiency (PE) of cropping systems is to develop P-efficient genotypes. Two key traits have been thought to contribute to genotypic PE, namely the efficiency at which P is taken up (PAE) and at which P taken up is converted to biomass (PUE). Low grain P concentration (LGP) has recently been proposed as a third key trait that could improve the PE of a system through reduced P removal with grains. Screening methods for PAE, PUE and LGP are discussed with particular focus on interactions among these traits and the potential to exploit genotypic variation for breeding P-efficient rice genotypes targeted to specific environments. Further, potential changes in nutrient budgets within the known scope of genotypic variation for key PE traits in rice were evaluated. At low to medium yield, simulated yield increased with 40 – 60 and 15 % by increasing PAE and PUE respectively. Higher PAE increased P removal with 1 – 2 kg P ha− 1 at low to medium yields, leading to accelerated P mining when no P is applied. Limited scope exists for reducing P mining by a LGP trait in severely P-deficient systems, but P removal from fields can be reduced with 0. 5 – 5 kg P ha− 1 by a LGP trait at medium to high yields.

40|$|Weed {{control is}} one of the most {{important}} crop protection activities undertaken in both intensive and <b>low-input</b> <b>farming</b> systems. However, even under intensive systems, crop protection which is less dependent on pesticides may require that weeds be managed to obtain a balance between crop and non-crop vegetation to encourage an increase in natural enemies of crop pests. In the <b>low-input</b> <b>farming</b> systems which sustain much of the rural population of Africa, weed control is usually done by hand and `clean weeding ' is often beyond the labour resources of the farming family. The vegetational diversity of peasant agriculture in Africa to which weeds make their contribution, helps to decrease the risk of disease and pest epidemics. In addition to the pest control bene®ts of a diverse agroecosystem, weeds contribute to the resource base of the rural community, providing a source of secondary foods, medicines and insecticides. Weed control within an integrated crop protection system appropriate to the needs of the resource-poor farmer, requires that weeds are managed in such a way that their biodiversity is maintained and the more useful species retained within the ®eld or ®eld margin. Those weeds with high food potential or which have pesticidal or medicinal properties might be deliberately encouraged within the crop or ®eld margins. Certain weed species may harbour important pests or diseases of local crops and therefore should be selectively removed.

Despite a wealth of studies related to the efficacy of different lure and kill and mass-trapping systems in several olive producing areas, there are few known regarding the performance of such systems in low input olive farms of the desert-like areas of the Middle East. The present study reports on the control {{of the olive}} fly using both lure and kill and mass-trapping devices in <b>low-input</b> <b>farms</b> in the region of Tubas, Palestine, between 2010 and 2012. The effect of environmental factors, such as elevation, on general patterns of olive fly infestation and the lure and kill system's performance was also studied. Our final goal included the development of a general strategy to produce organic olive oil using alternative olive fly control methods. Initially we used a commercially available lure and kill device, the Eco-Trap (R). The Eco-Trap performed relatively well during the three years of study, significantly reducing olive fly damage levels. Eco-Trap effectiveness was more evident at elevation above 400 m, where damage in the region of Tubas was more intense than at lower elevations. In a subsequent trial we tested a low-cost mass-trapping device. This device demonstrated similar levels of protection to the one seen with the Eco-Trap. Results showed that lure and kill and mass-trapping tactics can be effectively applied in the region of Tubas, and that accessible devices can be adopted to reduce control costs. The results also showed differential levels of damage throughout the region, which were related to elevation above sea level. The possibility of applying a regional management concept throughout the area by a centralized organization, such as a farmer's union based on mass-trapping systems seems feasible and is discussed.

Minimizing the ecological impacts of dairy sheep farming systems could represent a key factor for farmers to bridging the gaps in competitiveness of such systems and also obtaining public incentives. However, scarce is the knowledge about the environmental performance of Mediterranean dairy sheep farms. The main objectives of this paper were (i) to compare {{the environmental impacts of}} sheep {{milk production}} from three dairy farms in Sardinia (Italy), characterized by different input levels, and (ii) to identify the hotspots for improving the environmental performances of each farm, by using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The LCA was conducted using two different assessment methods: Carbon Footprint-IPCC and ReCiPe end-point. The analysis, conducted “from cradle to gate”, was based on the functional unit 1 kg of Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM). The observed trends of the environmental performances of the studied farming systems were similar for both evaluation methods. The GHG emissions revealed a little range of variation (from 2. 0 to 2. 3 kg CO 2 -eq per kg of FPCM) with differences between farming systems being not significant. The ReCiPe end-point analysis showed a larger range of values and environmental performances of the <b>low-input</b> <b>farm</b> were significantly different compared to the medium- and high-input farms.

Moreover, whole grain contains several bioactive compounds that confer to wheat-derived products unique nutraceutical properties (dietary fibre, antioxidants). The present research provided interesting insights for the selection of wheat genotypes suitable for low-input systems and the development of specific breeding programs dedicated to organic farming. The investigation involved 5 old not dwarf genotypes (Andriolo, Frassineto, Gentil rosso, Inallettabile, Verna) and 1 modern dwarf variety (Palesio), grown under biodynamic management, over two consecutive growing seasons (2009 / 2010, 2010 / 2011). Results evidenced that under <b>low-input</b> <b>farming</b> some investigated old wheat genotypes (Frassineto, Inallettabile) were comparable to the modern cultivar in terms of whole agronomic performance. As regards the nutritional and nutraceutical properties, some old genotypes (Andriolo, Gentil rosso, Verna) emerged for their relevant content of several investigated phytochemicals (such as insoluble dietary fibre, polyphenols, flavonoids, in vitro antioxidant activity) and nutrients (protein, lipid, minerals). Despite of the low technological features, the six wheat varieties grown under low-input management may efficiently provide raw material for the preparation of traditionally processed bread with valuable sensory and nutritional properties. Results highlighted that old wheat varieties have peculiar phytochemical composition and may be a valuable source of nutraceutical compounds.

Classic selection response theory is taken as the starting point for the comparison of selection trials (on farm and research centre) with respect to the expected genetic improvement in a target environment (<b>low-input</b> <b>farms).</b> The variance-covariance parameters that form the input for selection response comparisons traditionally come from a mixed model fit to multi-environment trial data. In this paper we propose a recently developed class of mixed models, namely multiplicative mixed models, also called factor-analytic models, for modelling genetic variances and covariances (correlations). Mixed multiplicative models allow genetic variances and covariances to be dependent on quantitative descriptors of the environment, and confer a high flexibility in the choice of variance-covariance structure, without requiring the estimation of a prohibitively high number of parameters. As a result detailed considerations regarding selection response comparisons are facilitated. ne statistical machinery involved is illustrated on an example data set consisting of barley trials from the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA). Analysis of the example data showed that participatory plant breeding and formal plant breeding are better interpreted as providing complementary rather than competing information...|$|R
40|$|In low-input {{and organic}} systems, {{nutrient}} management {{is key to}} ensuring the short-term productivity and the longer-term sustainability of the farming system. Farm-gate nutrient budgets/balances calculate the inputs of nutrients to, and outputs from a system. Hence, {{they can be used}} to assess the nutrient use efficiency. Nutrient balances of 69 organic and <b>low-input</b> dairy <b>farms</b> in seven European countries were carried out using a sustainability assessment tool. The tool assesses each individual farm against a number of indicators. Part of the assessment of nutrient management is the calculation of an N,P,K budget, based on physical inputs and outputs for each enterprise. The results show considerable variation in the calculated N,P,K balances. The paper will explore the reasons for high nutrient surpluses and deficits and discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} calculated farm-gate nutrient budgets...|$|R
30|$|The forage {{calendar}} reconstituted here {{puts the}} emphasis on the complementarity of diversified forage resources, in time and space, that is usually the sustainability pillar of low-input pastoral systems (Bollig 2006; Genin et al. 2012). It highlights the keystone place of tree foliage in this system, even though this type of forage resource is reputed to present several limitations for animal nutrition. The interests and limitations of fodder tree exploitation have been reviewed in the literature (Paterson et al. 1998); they take different forms depending on whether trees are planted or exploited from natural establishment. The lack of knowledge on economically and ecologically sustainable tree management is also pointed out (Smith et al. 2012). However, there is general consensus regarding the interest of fodder trees for the ecosystem services and goods they can provide, particularly for dry areas and <b>low-input</b> livestock <b>farming</b> systems (Le Houérou 2006).|$|R
