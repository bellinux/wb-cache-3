The New Hebrides achieved independence (as Vanuatu) in 1980, with Belize following suit in 1981. The {{passage of the}} British Nationality Act 1981, which reclassified the remaining Crown colonies as [...] "British Dependent Territories" [...] (renamed British Overseas Territories in 2002) meant that, aside from a scattering of islands and outposts, the process of decolonisation that had begun after the Second World War was largely complete. In 1982, Britain's resolve in defending its remaining overseas territories was tested when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, acting on a long-standing claim that dated back to the Spanish Empire. Britain's ultimately successful military response to retake the islands during the ensuing Falklands War was viewed by many to have contributed to reversing the downward trend in Britain's status as a world power. The same year, the Canadian government severed its last <b>legal</b> <b>link</b> with Britain by patriating the Canadian constitution from Britain. The 1982 Canada Act passed by the British parliament ended the need for British involvement in changes to the Canadian constitution. Similarly, the Constitution Act 1986 reformed the constitution of New Zealand to sever its constitutional link with Britain, and the Australia Act 1986 severed the constitutional link between Britain and the Australian states.

40|$|Latin {{terms like}} domus, used to {{designate}} the origo, or domicilium, {{have many features}} in common, {{but they do not}} mean the same thing. The term origo encompasses different meanings such as origin, birth, geographic origin, family and lineage. The domicilium, for its part, designates the dwelling place, but also the so-called incola, ie. the inhabitant that has emigrated to a certain community. In the latter case, the term domus, in contrast with the term municeps, emphasizes the <b>legal</b> <b>link</b> between the city and the immigrant. Most manuals of epigraphy identify erroneously origo with domicilium or simply avoid the issue. We examine the examples from Hispanic epigraphy, where the origin is referred to by the term domus. When we find the formula domo + toponym/gentile name, we must assume that it refers to the origo, never to the domicilium, and should be translated as ‘native of’, and not ‘with domicile in’...|$|E
40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} public policy debate {{regarding}} the role search engines can play {{in the fight against}} intellectual property theft. However, for any sensible policy discussion it must first be the case that changes in search results can influence consumers’ decisions to pirate or purchase legally. Surprisingly, there is little empirical evidence on this important policy issue. To analyze this question, we design a customized search engine and conduct experiments on a general population of users and on college-aged users where we manipulate the positions of infringing and legal sites in users’ search results. Our data show that users are more likely to purchase legally when <b>legal</b> <b>links</b> are promoted in search results, and users are more likely to pirate when pirate links are promoted. Together our results suggest that reducing the prominence of pirated links can be a viable policy option in the fight against intellectual property theft...|$|R

40|$|This article {{provides}} a critical reading of four cases {{that took place}} before nineteenth century Mixed Commissions on the Slave Trade at Sierra Leone, namely the Sinceridade, Activo, Perpetuo Defensor and Maria da Gloria cases. Mixed Commissions were early institutional sites where international law was confronted with victims on a multiple scale. Although they {{had the power to}} emancipate slaves, Mixed Commissions did not do so as a result of rights attributed to slaves as human beings. Rather this article shows that the capacity of Mixed Commissions to emancipate slaves was dependent upon the legality of the search, seizure and detention of the slave ship on which slaves were found. This <b>legal</b> <b>link</b> between emancipation and lawful intervention left slaves in a potentially precarious legal position even at the point of “rescue”. However, in two of the cases examined here the worst effects of this precariousness were avoided through slave resistance.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an ontology design pattern for legal links {{based on the}} event notion. A <b>legal</b> <b>link</b> could not be considered as a direct link between two documents. Many parameters should actually be taken into account when dealing with this information {{in order to have a}} closer matching of the real situation at the origin of this link. In fact, law is a highly interconnected network of documents, which makes access to legal knowledge a complex task particularly for information retrieval systems. Many types of links exist between various types of documents, each of which have specific source and target types. Complex queries, centered on types of links and on their related properties, emerge as an urgent need to handle the complexity of this domain. An ontology-based approach is proposed to model a collection of legal documents allowing to manage in a unified way the different characteristics of such a collection. The references module of the document ontology focuses on the typology of links and their related properties (date, author, etc.). Due to the recurrence of the reference situation when modeling any legal event, we propose to define an ontology design pattern for legal references which is intended to enable reusability and thus simplifying the task of a legal ontology designer...|$|E
40|$|Book-tax {{conformity}} {{refers to}} the <b>legal</b> <b>link</b> between financial and tax accounts, and is an institutional feature of many continental European countries and countries like Japan that follow continental European traditions. Many studies argue that book-tax conformity impedes earnings informativeness. However, book-tax-conformity is required for single accounts but not for group accounts, which are used to inform capital markets. Previous research has not properly used this distinction. The absence of a formal link between group income and taxable income makes a causal empirical relationship between legal book-tax conformity and resulting cross-country differences in group earnings properties much less compelling. We argue that studies documenting this relationship suffer either from an omitted variable problem (i. e., failure to sufficiently control for differences in reporting incentives) or sample selection bias (inclusion/noninclusion of single accounts in the test sample). We reassess cross-country differences in asymmetric earnings timeliness and find that legal book-tax conformity does not affect cross-country differences in group earnings properties when the institutional environment is adequately controlled for. Instead, group accounting follows typical reporting incentives even in countries where there is high book-tax conformity for single accounts. Furthermore, we show that even "tax-dominated" single accounts are responsive to nontax reporting incentives...|$|E
40|$|We {{define the}} common {{randomness}} assisted capacity of an arbitrarily varying channel (AVWC) when the Eavesdropper is kept ignorant about the common randomness. We prove a multi-letter capacity formula for this model. We prove that, if enough common randomness is used, the capacity formula {{can be given}} a single-shot form again. We then consider the opposite extremal case, where no common randomness is available. It is known that {{the capacity of the}} system can be discontinuous under these circumstances. We prove here that it is still stable {{in the sense that it}} is continuous around its positivity points. We further prove that discontinuities can only arise if the <b>legal</b> <b>link</b> is symmetrizable and characterize the points where it is positive. These results shed new light on the design principles of communication systems with embedded security features. At last we investigate the effect of super-activation of the message transmission capacity of AVWCs under the average error criterion. We give a complete characterization of those AVWCs that may be super-activated. The effect is thereby also related to the (conjectured) super-activation of the common randomness assisted capacity of AVWCs with an eavesdropper that gets to know the common randomness. Super-activation is based on the idea of "wasting" a few bits of non-secret messages in order to enable provably secret transmission of a large bulk of data, a concept that may prove to be of further importance in the design of communication systems. In this work we provide further insight into this phenomenon by providing a class of codes that is capacity-achieving and does not convey any information to the Eavesdropper.
