50|$|The Colchester Merino Mill {{built in}} 1880 and {{extended}} in 1902 {{stands in a}} group of buildings built on a large rock outcrop. The buildings are dated from 1860 to 1902. The 1902 extension connected it to the Winooski Worsted Mill. Its name tells us that this was a woolen mill built to spin the finest <b>long</b> <b>staple</b> merino <b>wool.</b> It was a 3 story brick built mill with heavy beam construction. The twenty pane windows are topped by segmental brick arches. It was powered by an internal waterwheel which exploited a sliceway from an earlier mill, and used the head provided by the timber dam at the lower falls.|$|R

25|$|Combing {{straightens}} the fibres, isolates {{the long}} ones (tops) for spinning and discards the short ones (noil). There are {{various types of}} combing machines here, including the French comb, the Lister comb and the Holden comb.

50|$|It {{was made}} in several parts of England {{at the end of}} the medieval period. The raw {{material}} was short <b>staple</b> <b>wool,</b> carded and spun into yarn and then woven on a broad loom to produce cloth 1.75 yards wide. It was then fulled, usually in a fulling mill. When fulled, the fibres of the cloth would felt together, resulting in a smooth surface.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The Egyptian economy depends {{heavily on}} cotton {{as the major}} export {{commodity}} among agricultural commodities.

It provides about 45 {{percent of the world}} exports of extra <b>long</b> <b>staple</b> cotton.

Egyptian cotton faces competition from other <b>long</b> <b>staple</b> exporting countries, mainly Sudan. The U. S. is the major producing and exporting country of short and medium staple cotton. The introduction of man-made fibers is believed to have affected the market for Egyptian cotton. The effect of variations in the income of the importing countries must be considered. In this study, a simultaneous equation model was developed in order to investigate these effects. The model consists of eight structural equations, representing the demand for and supply of export cotton for Egypt, Sudan, Peru and the U. S. The analysis is based on time series data for the period 1950 - 80. The results show that the export price of each country is the major factor in determining the export sales of its cotton. Demand elasticities ranged from - 0. 95 to - 1. 21. Egypt's export price affects the demand for Sudan's cotton, and Sudan's price affects the demand for Egypt's cotton. Peru's export quantities are affected by Egypt and Sudan prices more than they affect them. U. S. prices, and man-made fiber prices didn't significantly affect the demand for <b>long</b> <b>staple</b> cotton. The export supply for Egypt, Sudan and Peru is insensitive to changes in own export price...|$|R
