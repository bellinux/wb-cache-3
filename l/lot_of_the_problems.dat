[...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I think that a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> we deal with today {{in the world are}} the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now."

He also acknowledged, however, that most people from indigenous-speaking communities lacked the literacy in English needed to keep a job.

The government discovered that several of the teachers lacked formal education beyond high school, that none of them were qualified as teachers, and that the teachers were employed by the church and not by the school. The leaders of the school refuted a lot of the criticism from the parents but admitted that the bus driver had been an assistant for the 7 to 9 year olds. They promised to rectify the problems. The school authorities ordered them to rectify a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> and warned the school that they could lose their government grant. The working conditions were also controlled by the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority and they were instructed to have procedures for conflict resolution, for clarifying the school's religious education, for employee attendance at prayer meetings, and to show the separation between the school and the church.

Generally speaking about the album's lyrics, Kensrue said, [...] "I would definitely say that we've drawn a lot of our influence from the current state of politics, but I also like to personalize things when I write, and I've always written that way." [...] The song [...] "Blood On the Sand" [...] (with the opening line: [...] "We wave our flags, we swallow fear like medicine / We kiss the hands of profiteers and their congressmen") was described as having [...] "much more hard-hitting political dialogue" [...] and Kensrue elaborated in another interview that, [...] "I've usually tried to stay out of being explicitly political in the sense of being partisan, at least in my art. I really hate the party system and think it's a huge part of a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> we have ... I try not to go to the party lines but to just talk about actual social issues that have political ramifications." [...] The song [...] "Black Honey" [...] conjures imagery of a man swatting at bees in order to collect their honey while becoming confused why they would sting him back, which Kensrue said [...] "seemed a fitting metaphor for much of U.S. foreign policy." [...] The song [...] "Whistleblower" [...] is about Edward Snowden, who famously leaked NSA documents proving that the government was spying on American citizens without warrant. The song [...] "Death from Above" [...] was written from the perspective of an unmanned combat aerial vehicle (or drone) pilot.

In fact, the game's complicated control scheme is better served on an Xbox controller than it is in the PC's typical mouse and keyboard setup." [...] However, he too criticized the lack of Xbox Live support and the poor graphical quality of the cutscenes. Game Revolution gave the game a B+, praising the controls and atmosphere, but criticizing the AI and lack of Xbox Live support.

We show that atomic Pinters algebras {{may not be}} completely representable, however the class of completely representable Pinters algebras is elementary and finitely axiomatizable.

We show that the class of subdirect products of set algebras is a canonical variety that is locally finite only for finite dimensions, and has the superamalgamation property; the latter for all dimensions.
