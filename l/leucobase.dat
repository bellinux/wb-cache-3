40|$|The {{reaction}} between mercaptosuccinic acid (TMA) and {{methylene blue}} (MB) {{was investigated in}} acidic mediumusing Cu (II) as catalyst. Two moles of substrate are oxidized by one mole of MB forming the corresponding disulphide anddihydromethylene blue. The order in MB is zero while order in TMA is unity. The rate shows a maximum on varying [H+]whereas it increases linearly on increasing [Cu (II) ]. Electrolytes exert a diverse influence, which is attributed toenvironmental effect. The rate increases on increasing the dielectric constant of the medium but it remains unaffected onadding externally the disulphide and <b>leucobase</b> to the system. It is known that Zn (II) -pyrazole complex acts as a model forthe enzyme, liver alcohol dehydrogenase (LADH) which regulates the function of liver 22. 3 -Methyl- 1 phenyl- 2 -pryazoline- 5 -one (Pyrazolone) was also added to the system {{in a bid to}} investigate the effect of simultaneous ligation of catalyst on therate and pyrazolone was found to retard the reactio...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} for vital staining of nervous tissue with methylene blue; it involves impregnation of whole embryos or tissue-fragments with the rongalit-reduced dye under anaerobic conditions at pH 5, followed by {{development of the}} stain in an oxygenated neutral saline solution. Determinations of the solubility of leuco-methylene blue and experiments on vital staining with it and with the oxidized dye at different pH values {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that the dye penetrates cell membranes and tissues mainly as the <b>leucobase,</b> but may pass along nerve (and muscle) fibres in the oxidized form. Penetration of the leucomethylene blue below pH 5 is hindered by its ionization; above pH 5 the penetration falls off because of reduced per-meability of the cell membranes. SOME four years ago, with the help of Miss L. Morris, one of the presentauthors developed a new method of vital staining of the nervous system of the embryo dogfish, Scyliorhinus canicula, using a modification of the old-established rongalit methylene blue technique. The success of this method led to an experimental study of some of the factors involved, and the present account deals mainly with these studies. The work is concerned almost en-tirely with the penetration of the stain into the tissues; the part, if any, played by the specific chemical combination of nerve-cell constituents with the dye-stuff in its final site is not considered. Since the method used originally on the dogfish has not previously been published, and has been very little modified {{as a result of the}} later work, it will be convenient to outline it first...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{series of}} derivatives of Brilliant Green containing substituents in the 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -positions of the phenyl ring has been synthesised. Their respective visible absorption spectra have been {{correlated with the}} electronic and steric effects of the substituents. A linear relationship between the wavelength of maximum absorption for the x-band of the nieta- and para- substituted derivatives and the respective Haurnett substituent constant has been established. The effect on the x-band of ortho- substition {{is consistent with the}} relief of steric hindrance by rotation of the phenyl ring. The perchlorates of a range of rneta- and para- substituted derivatives of Brilliant Green have been prepared from the corresponding <b>leucobase</b> or carbinol. A study of the hydrolysis of the dye to the dye-base has been made. The hydrolysis reaction for each dye perchlorate has been investigated under conditions such that pseudo first order kinetics were obtained. The effects on the observed rate constant of changing the hydroxide ion concentration, the concentration of inert salt and the temperature have been observed. The rate law has been determined and shown to be basically the same for each dye. The proposed mechanism is + Ki BG + h 20 BGOH 2 K- I BG + - K 2 + ON BGOH - kT 2 + where BG represents the dye cation. The Harwnett equation has been shown to apply to the rates of hydrolysis of the various meta- and para- substituted dyes and a value for the reaction constant, p, has been obtained. The thermodynamic parameters, AiP and have been obtained for each dye and the reaction {{has been shown to be}} under entropy control. An isokinetic relationship has been established providing evidence that each compound studied undergoes hydrolysis by the same mechanism. The equilibrium constants for the two reaction steps shown above have been obtained at a number of temperatures for the parent dye, Brilliant Green...|$|E
