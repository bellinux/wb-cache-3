25|$|The {{compatibility}} {{problem is}} to take two or more polyominoes and find a figure that can be tiled with each. Polyomino compatibility has been widely studied since the 1990s. Jorge Luis Mireles and Giovanni Resta have published websites of systematic results,ominoes"] and Livio Zucca shows results for some complicated cases <b>like</b> <b>three</b> different pentominoes. The general problem can be hard. The first compatibility figure for the L and X pentominoes was published in 2005 and had 80 tiles of each kind. Many pairs of polyominoes have been proved incompatible by systematic exhaustion. No algorithm is known for deciding whether two arbitrary polyominoes are compatible.|$|E
25|$|This lengthy-titled artwork {{features}} a large Tiger Shark suspended in formaldehyde, {{the most well-known}} of his series ‘Natural History’. This series is said to “contain some of the artist’s most widely recognized and important works”. The tank in which the shark is floating creates the illusion of the animal being cut into three pieces due to the container looking <b>like</b> <b>three</b> separate blocks. The work itself is very simplistic, featuring only the shark in a watery substance, which at first glance looks clear like glass. The piece itself is fairly old, having been created in 1991. Because of this, the formaldehyde preserving the shark has slowly eaten away at the animal’s body, showing signs of decay.|$|E

But as soon as thoughts of repentance stirred in their hearts, God accepted them. Whatever thoughts one of the sons developed, the others developed as well, so that all three were of one heart. The area around them split apart, but the spot on which each stood was not touched. They stood separately <b>like</b> <b>three</b> pillars.

25|$|The obituaries {{shortly after}} Lawrence's death were, with the {{exception}} of the one by E. M. Forster, unsympathetic or hostile. However, there were those who articulated a more favourable recognition of the significance of this author's life and works. For example, his long-time friend Catherine Carswell summed up his life in a letter to the periodical Time and Tide published on 16 March 1930. In response to his critics, she claimed:"In the face of formidable initial disadvantages and lifelong delicacy, poverty that lasted for three quarters of his life and hostility that survives his death, he did nothing that he did not really want to do, and all that he most wanted to do he did. He went all over the world, he owned a ranch, he lived in the most beautiful corners of Europe, and met whom he wanted to meet and told them that they were wrong and he was right. He painted and made things, and sang, and rode. He wrote something <b>like</b> <b>three</b> dozen books, of which even the worst page dances with life that could be mistaken for no other man's, while the best are admitted, even by those who hate him, to be unsurpassed. Without vices, with most human virtues, the husband of one wife, scrupulously honest, this estimable citizen yet managed to keep free from the shackles of civilization and the cant of literary cliques. He would have laughed lightly and cursed venomously in passing at the solemn owls—each one secretly chained by the leg—who now conduct his inquest. To do his work and lead his life in spite of them took some doing, but he did it, and long after they are forgotten, sensitive and innocent people—if any are left—will turn Lawrence's pages and will know from them what sort of a rare man Lawrence was."Aldous Huxley also defended Lawrence in his introduction to a collection of letters published in 1932. However, the most influential advocate of Lawrence's literary reputation was Cambridge literary critic F. R. Leavis, who asserted that the author had made an important contribution to the tradition of English fiction. Leavis stressed that The Rainbow, Women in Love, and the short stories and tales were major works of art. Later, the obscenity trials over the unexpurgated edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover in America in 1959, and in Britain in 1960, and subsequent publication of the full text, ensured Lawrence's popularity (and notoriety) with a wider public.|$|E

When comparing the film to the early episodes of the show, Stephen Rowley concluded that the film [...] "has more going for it than the show in its later years, but {{is still a long way}} short of what made it so invigorating". The Monthly critic Luke Davies echoed Lowry's concerns about the length: [...] "everything moves with the whip-crack speed of a half-hour episode. And that's the paradox: it makes the film feel <b>like</b> <b>three</b> episodes strung together. We're in a cinema, and we expect something epic."

[...] In terms of her own personal style, Sevigny cited the Australian film Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), which features schoolgirls dressed in elaborate Victorian clothing, as a major inspiration; she has also cited it as one of her favorite films. She has also been outspoken in her favoritism of vintage clothing over designer pieces: [...] "I still prefer to buy vintage over spending it all on one designer", she told The Times. [...] "I'll go to Resurrection or Decades and be like, 'Oh, I'm going to buy everything,' but {{a lot of it is}} extremely expensive, so I'll go to Wasteland and satisfy that urge and it's not too hard on the pocketbook.

500|$|While holidaying in London after Marquee Moons completion, Verlaine {{saw that}} Television {{had been put}} on NMEs front cover and called Elektra's press department, who {{encouraged}} Television to capitalize on their success there with {{a tour of the}} UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel's American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's middle-American, progressive rock audiences and found the tour unnerving. In May, the band embarked on a highly successful theatre tour in the UK and were enthusiastically received by audiences. Verlaine said that it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after having played clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that the tour's supporting act, Blondie, did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB. Blondie guitarist Chris Stein said Television were [...] "so competitive" [...] and unaccommodating on the tour and that they did not treat it like a joint effort. He recalled one show where [...] "all our equipment was shoved up at the [...] Apollo and we had <b>like</b> <b>three</b> feet of room so that [...] could stand still in this vast space." ...|$|E

Schwartz criticized the episode's killing and resurrection of May as [...] "one of the weaker storytelling tricks in an otherwise solid episode—and as expected, May came back and is just fine." [...] Writing for Nerdist, Joseph McCabe had mixed feelings about the episode's political angle {{and the use of}} Inhumans as a stand-in for minorities, but praised the chemistry between Coulson, Mack, and Fitz, and the further exploration of Jeffrey Mace. McCabe was highly critical of guest star Lorenzo James Henrie, calling him [...] "no more charismatic here than he was in Fear the Walking Dead, and his character is every bit as unsympathetic as his misguided rebel was on that show, wheelchair or no." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush was particularly negative, feeling the episodes' different storylines [...] "ended up feeling <b>like</b> <b>three</b> disparate stories with some notable reaching'. He felt the Inhuman prejudice storyline and attack by looters on Gabe were forced, and that the May storyline did not [...] "really [...] our idea of where the AI or ghostly threads will end up".

500|$|Initial {{critical}} response towards Aurora {{was generally}} unfavorable. During the 1950s, Disney received [...] "harsh criticism" [...] for depicting both Cinderella and Aurora as [...] "naïve and malleable" [...] characters, {{and failing to}} acknowledge {{the ways in which}} women's roles in society had evolved since Snow White's debut in 1937. Critics agree that Aurora represents [...] "the classic damsel in distress" [...] by being depicted as a beautiful young woman who is rescued by a stranger. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times felt that the character was too similar to Snow White, writing, [...] "The princess looks so much like Snow White they could be a couple of Miss Rheingolds separated by three or four years." [...] Time Out dismissed Aurora as a [...] "delicate" [...] and [...] "vapid" [...] character. Bustle's Mary Grace Garis wrote that the character [...] "suffers from having very little definable personality and ... serious Damsel-in-Distress syndrome". Sonia Saraiya of Jezebel echoed this sentiment, criticizing Aurora for lacking [...] "interesting qualities"; Saraiya also ranked Aurora Disney's least feminist princess. Similarly, Bustle also ranked Aurora the least feminist Disney Princess, with author Chelsea Mize expounding, [...] "Aurora literally sleeps for <b>like</b> <b>three</b> quarters of the movie ... Aurora just straight-up has no agency, and really isn't doing {{much in the way of}} feminine progress." [...] Dismissing the character as [...] "barely more than a cipher", Leigh Butler of Tor.com panned Aurora as [...] "a Barbie doll knockoff who does nothing the whole film but sing wistfully about Finding Her Man, before becoming the ultimate passive Damsel in Distress". However, Butler went on to defend the character somewhat, writing, [...] "Aurora’s cipher-ness in Sleeping Beauty would be infuriating if she were the only female character in it, but the presence of the Fairies and Maleficent allow her to be what she is without it being a subconscious statement on what all women are." [...] Similarly, Refinery29 ranked Aurora the fourth most feminist Disney Princess because [...] "Her aunts have essentially raised her in a place where women run the game." ...|$|E
