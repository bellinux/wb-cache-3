40|$|Juniperus oxycedrus subsp. macrocarpa (Sibth. & Sm.) Neirl (Cupressaceae) is a {{dioecious}} evergreen shrub species, {{native of}} the Mediterranean region whose extracts, {{from different parts of}} the plant, have been used since ancient times for fragrance, flavoring, medicinal, antibacterial, insecticidal, and cosmetic purposes (1). J. oxycedrus subsp. macrocarpa is distributed from southwestern Spain to Middle East coasts (2). In Italy it is present almost in the entire peninsula including islands where it is characteristic of the consolidated coastal dunes (Habitat 2250 *: Coastal dunes with Juniperus spp.). The rust-red grain beetle, Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Steph.) (Coleoptera Laemophloeidae), is the smallest of the grain beetles (1. 5 - 2 mm), reddish-brown, flat and slender in the in the appearance. It is a worldwidediffused secondary pest that attacks grains, grain products and a multitude of dried vegetables and fruits. Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Coleoptera Curculionidae) also called <b>lesser</b> <b>rice</b> <b>weevil,</b> is a small (2. 5 - 4 mm), dark brown species with 4 distinct reddish patches on the elytra. S. oryzae {{is one of the most}} important pests of grains, pasta, flour, legumes, baked goods and even tobacco (3). Both species are therefore considered among the most harmful to the stored food causing huge losses wordwide. For these reasons, eco-friendly strategies to prevent such insect attacks to the stored and/or final packaged products are therefore highly foreseen. Due to their repellent properties, essential oils, obtained from aromatic plants, could represent a valid, ecofriendly alternative to synthetic repellents. In this study, the J. oxicedrus subsp. macrocarpa essential oil (JEO) was prepared from leaves and seed cones collected, from individuals growing along the Northern coast of Tuscany (Italy) in the Migliarino, San Rossore, Massaciuccoli Natural Park. JEO chemical composition was assessed by gas chromatography (GC) and by gas chromatography/electron impact mass spectroscopy (GC-EIMS). The repellent activity of JEO, against C. ferrugineus and S. oryzae, was then evaluated, in vitro, by the Area Preference Method (4). The results showed that JEO is constituted mainly by mono and sesqui-terpene hydrocarbons and that is rich in chemical components such as α-pinene that has been shown to be very effective as repellents against stored food insect pests (4). Area preference bioassay indicated that JEO exerts a good repellency against S. oryzae and C. ferrugineus. Interestingly, according to probit analysis, C. ferrugineus is about 15 times more susceptible to JEO than S. oryzae. Since aromatic plants EOs present very low toxicity to mammalians and no significant risks to the environment, JEO could represents an interesting, sustainable alternative to synthetic insects repellents that could contribute to fight the losses caused to stored food by insect pests...|$|E

40|$|Managing stored {{grains and}} seed {{requires}} {{the use of}} various techniques to ensure the quality of the product entering the storage facility does not deteriorate over time. These techniques include: the use of sanitation, storing sound, dry grain, managing temperature and aeration, using chemical protectants, regular sampling, and the use of fumigation. Bin and storage facilities also {{play an important role in}} determining the quality of the stored grain. Storage facilities should be inspected regularly for deterioration of any type. Proper storage moisture varies depending on type of seed, length of storage and storage conditions. Seed moisture content changes until equilibrium is established with the surrounding environment. The equilibrium moisture is different for each kind of seed. High oil content seeds (soybeans, peanuts, sunflowers) will not absorb as much moisture as seed with a high starch content (wheat, barley, corn, sorghum). Oil does not absorb water; therefore, in a seed with 40 % oil the seed moisture will be concentrated in the other 60 %. The time to reach equilibrium will vary from days to months depending on the kind of seed, humidity and temperature. When there are large differences in seed moisture and the surrounding environment the initial change is rapid and slows as equilibrium temperature/moisture is approached.

40|$|Thai rice {{is favored}} by {{large numbers of}} {{consumers}} of all continents because of its excellent taste, fragrant aroma and fine texture. Among all Thai rice varieties, Thai Hommali rice is the most preferred. Classification of rice as premium quality requires that almost all grain kernels of the rice be perfectly whole with only a small quantity of foreign particles. Of all the foreign particles found in <b>rice,</b> <b>rice</b> <b>weevils</b> can wreck severest havoc on {{the quality and quantity}} of rice such that premium grade rice is transformed into low grade rice. It is widely known that rice millers adopt the "overdose" fumigation practice to control the birth and propagation of <b>rice</b> <b>weevils,</b> the practice of which inevitably gives rise to pesticide residues on rice which end up in the body of consumers. However, if population concentration of <b>rice</b> <b>weevils</b> could be approximated, right amounts of chemicals for fumigation would be applied and thereby no overdose is required. The objective of this study is thus to estimate the quantity of <b>rice</b> <b>weevils</b> in both milled rice and brown rice of Thai Hommali rice variety using the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique.

40|$|Endo-polygalacturonase, one of {{the group}} of enzymes known collectively as pectinases, is widely {{distributed}} in bacteria, plants and fungi. The enzyme has also been found in several weevil species and a few other insects, such as aphids, but not in Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, or Caenorhabditis elegans or, as far as is known, in any more primitive animal species. What, then, is the genetic origin of the polygalacturonases in weevils? Since some weevil species harbor symbiotic microorganisms, it has been suggested, reasonably, that the symbionts' genomes of both aphids and weevils, rather than the insects' genomes, could encode polygalacturonase.

40|$|Graduation date: 1959 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the performance of four species of stored grain beetles in competition at three levels of moisture and temperature. The insects used in these tests were the granary <b>weevil,</b> the <b>rice</b> <b>weevil,</b> the saw-toothed grain beetle and the red flour beetle. The experiments were conducted at temperatures of 90, 80, and 70 degrees Fahrenheit and at moisture levels of 15, 12, and 9 percent moisture content in two varieties of commercial wheat. Redmond variety commercial feed wheat was used for the majority of these tests. Several of the tests were duplicated using Idaed variety seed wheat. The competition studies were designed to test the performance of one species of grain beetle when reared in the presence of one or two other species. The procedure used was to obtain 50 adult insects of each species from stock cultures. These insects were picked at random and introduced into 250 gram samples of wheat in one pint containers and allowed to remain for one week. The initial adult population was then removed and the adult progeny were counted periodically to determine the size and time of appearance of the first generation. The following combinations of insects were tested: 1. Granary weevil and saw-toothed grain beetle 2. Granary weevil and red flour beetle 3. Saw-toothed grain beetle and red flour beetle 4. Granary weevil, saw-toothed grain beetle and red flour beetle 5. <b>Rice</b> <b>weevil</b> and saw-toothed grain beetle 6. <b>Rice</b> <b>weevil</b> and red flour beetle In addition to these combinations, all species of insects were reared alone in each test in order to compare the performance of the insects when in pure culture and when in competitive situations with the other species. The <b>rice</b> <b>weevil</b> was the best competitor of the four species and was less influenced by the presence of other species of beetles. The <b>rice</b> <b>weevil</b> has a wide range of temperature and moisture tolerance and, though considered a tropical species, it is a common and successful pest of stored grain in the Pacific Northwest. The granary weevil was a good competitor because of its capacity to attack whole grains but did riot do as well as the <b>rice</b> <b>weevil,</b> probably because of its lower reproductive rate and longer life cycle. The granary <b>weevil</b> and the <b>rice</b> <b>weevil</b> were well adjusted to the conditions of these tests because of their ability as primary feeders in whole grain. Competition between weevils and bran bugs (the sawtoothed grain beetle and the red flour beetle) usually favored the bran bugs since the weevils chewed up the grain and made food material available to the bran bugs. In competition with weevils, the bran bugs usually appeared earlier than the former but ordinarily had smaller populations. In competition between bran bugs, the red flour beetle was almost always the dominant species. This was because of the ability of the red flour beetle to attack whole wheat grains and because of its extensive predation of the eggs and pupae of the saw-toothed grain beetle. The saw-toothed grain beetle and the red flour beetle usually produced larger populations {{in the presence of the}} <b>rice</b> <b>weevil</b> than when with the granary weevil. Where conditions of high temperature and moisture were present in the grain, mold often formed. The presence of the mold may have been favorable to the two species of bran bugs. It has been observed that when the granary <b>weevil</b> or the <b>rice</b> <b>weevil</b> is reared alone under high moisture conditions, there is considerable mold growth. When, however, the weevils are reared in the presence of one or two species of bran bugs, little or no mold is found. It is not known if the bran buns actually feed ori the mold but the results of these tests indicate that both species of bran bugs either feed on the mold or in some way inhibit its formation in grain at high moisture and. temperature levels.

40|$|Concentration {{curves and}} a set of summary {{statistics}} called have-statistics are useful in ecological analyses of dominance and evenness among individuals in reproductive success. This approach complements, but does not replace, approaches based on frequency distributions and standard summary statistics. Examples are drawn from studies of bullfrogs, red deer, elephant seals, sculpins, fruit flies, and <b>rice</b> <b>weevils,</b> as well as from some theoretical models similar to the Wright-Fisher model of evolutionary genetics...|$|R
