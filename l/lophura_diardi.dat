5000|$|... 72 mammal {{species and}} 181 bird {{species have been}} {{recorded}} in Núi Chúa National Park. The Park also supports a number of mammal and bird species of global conservation concern, including the Black-shanked Douc Pygathrix nigripes, Pygmy Loris Nycticebus pygmaeus, Asian Black Bear Ursus thibetanus, Sun Bear (U. malayanus), Large-antlered Muntjac Muntiacus vuquangensis and Siamese Fireback <b>Lophura</b> <b>diardi.</b> It {{is reported to have}} the highest known population of Black-shanked Douc in Vietnam.|$|E
5000|$|There are 500 {{species of}} {{bird in the}} region {{including}} the critically endangered and possibly extinct white-eyed river martin (Pseudochelidon sirintarae), the endemic grey-faced tit-babbler (Macronous kelleyi) and the endangered or threatened Bengal florican (Eupodotis bengalensis), greater adjutant (Leptoptilos dubius) and white-shouldered ibis (Pseudibis davisoni). Other birds of the remaining woodlands of the area include the silver pheasant (Lophura nycthemera), Siamese fireback (<b>Lophura</b> <b>diardi),</b> Mrs. Hume's pheasant (Syrmaticus humiae), grey peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron bicalcaratum), sarus crane (Grus antigone), great hornbill (Buceros bicornis), Austen's brown hornbill (Anorrhinus austeni), and wreathed hornbill (Aceros undulatus).|$|E
50|$|The Siamese {{fireback}} (<b>Lophura</b> <b>diardi)</b> {{also known}} as Diard's fireback is a fairly large, approximately 80 cm long, pheasant. The male has a grey plumage with an extensive red facial skin, crimson legs and feet, ornamental black crest feathers, reddish brown iris and long curved blackish tail. The female is a brown bird with blackish wing and tail feathers.The Siamese fireback is distributed to the lowland and evergreen forests of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam in Southeast Asia. This species is also designated as the national bird of Thailand. The female usually lays between four and eight rosy eggs.|$|E
50|$|The Phou Xiang Thong IBA (36,650 hectare) is {{situated}} within the Phou Xiengthong NBCA (120,000 hectare). The IBA encompasses two provinces, Salavan and Champasak. The IBA {{is located at}} an altitude of 40 - 500 m above sea level. Its topography is characterized by low hills, lowlands, rivers, and seasonal streams. Its habitat contains dry deciduous tropical forest, moist deciduous tropical forest, semi-evergreen tropical rain forest, mixed deciduous forest, dry dipterocarp forest, and open rocky savanna. Notable avifauna include Siamese fireback (<b>Lophura</b> <b>diardi),</b> red-collared woodpecker (Picus rabieri), green peafowl (Pavo muticus), and grey-faced tit babbler (Macronous kelleyi).|$|E
50|$|Núi Chúa National Park (which was {{initially}} a reserve) is in Ninh Thuận Province, {{reported to be}} the driest province in Vietnam, and has an area of 29865 ha. The park was established in 2010. It also has the coastal and marine habitats which are reported {{to be in good}} condition. The unique original vegetation which consisted of a mixture of evergreen forest, semi-evergreen forest and deciduous forest has been mostly denuded due over exploitation in the early 1990s. The beach where the sea turtle nestle is located on a promontory bordering a marine park with coral reefs; 11 species of turtles, both terrestrial and marine are recorded. Global conservation concerns are serious in view of anthropological pressures in the area particularly for black-shanked douc (Pygathrix nigripes) highest number in Vietnam, pygmy loris (Nycticebus pygmaeus), Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus), sun bear (U. malayanus), large-antlered muntjac Muntiacus vuquangensis and Siamese fireback (<b>Lophura</b> <b>diardi).</b> The total Fauna recorded in the park consist of 72 mammal species and 181 bird species. Bats are also common; Cynopterus brachyotis is the endangered species {{out of a total of}} 12 species.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTropical Asian Galliformes are secretive and {{difficult}} to survey. Many of these species are considered “at risk” due to habitat degradation although reliable density estimates are lacking. Using camera trapping and distance sampling data collected on the Siamese Fireback (<b>Lophura</b> <b>diardi)</b> in northeastern Thailand, we compared density estimates for pristine and degraded lowland forest. Density was poorly estimated using distance sampling, likely due to small sample size arising from poor visibility in dense vegetation and bird’s sensitivity to observers. We analysed camera trap data using both count-based and presence/absence-based methods. Those density estimates had narrower confidence intervals than those obtained using distance sampling. Estimated density was higher in dry evergreen forest (5. 6  birds km− 2), than in old forest plantations (0. 2  birds km− 2), perhaps because dense forest habitats provide Firebacks with more resources and refuge from predation. Our results suggest that camera trap data {{can be used for}} estimating density of cryptic terrestrial bird species inhabiting tropical forest that lack unique identification markings. However, this technique requires that the effective sampling area is known and thus requires knowledge of the animal home range size...|$|E
40|$|The Orange-necked Partridge Arborophila davidi was {{discovered}} in 1927 at Bu Kroai, Song Be Province in Vietnam (Delacour et al., 1928). Until 1991 it {{was considered to be}} extinct, when it was reported to have been seen very briefly on a site near Dac Lua, a substation of Cat Tien National Park, Dong Nai Province (Eames et al., 1992). From February 1997 until the end of April 1997, a three-month survey of the Orangenecked Partridge was made in Cat Tien National Park and in the neighbouring Cat Loc Nature Reserve. The aim of this survey was to determine if the species was present and to gather data on its ecology and behaviour. The site near Dac Lua was searched and line transects were used to survey other areas systematically. Five other species of galliforms were also surveyed; Germain’s Peacockpheasant Polyplectron germaini, Scaly-breasted Partridge Arborophila chloropus, Siamese Fireback <b>Lophura</b> <b>diardi,</b> Red Junglefowl Gallus gallus and Green Peafowl Pavo muticus. The presence of the Orange-necked Partridge was established in an area of approximately 10 km 2 in Cat Loc (up to 26 individuals) and at two sites in Cat Tien (two and five individuals). The Orange-necked Partridge appears to have a preference for slopes covered with bamboo and a thick litter layer. The species seems to tolerate some degree of habitat disturbance by man. Both Cat Tien and especially Cat Loc are under threat. Large areas of Cat Loc have been cleared of forest and the central government of Vietnam is encouraging the hill tribes that live there to start commercial cashew nut plantations. Particularly Cat Loc Nature Reserve needs to be better protected to secure the continued existence of the Orange-necked Partridge...|$|E
