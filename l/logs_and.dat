40|$|INTRODUCTION Current {{databases}} need <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> recovery {{to maintain}} the correctness properties of transactions and consistency of the database under failures. Also, <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> recovery have tremendous performance implications. While {{there has been a}} lot of work that deals with <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> recovery algorithms for traditional disk resident databases ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) and Main Memory Databases (MMDB) ([6, 7]), researchers have not systematically explored the issue of <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> recovery in Real-Time Databases (RTDB). In fact, there is a need 109 110 REAL-TIME DATABASE SYSTEMS: ARCHITECTURE AND TECHNIQUES for designing new algorithms for <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> recovery in RTDBs because the sequential nature of <b>logging</b> <b>and</b> the lack of time and priority cognizance during recovery are not in tune with the priority oriented and preemptive nature of activities in RTDBs.

5|$|Mutinus elegans is saprobic—deriving {{nutrients}} {{by breaking}} down dead or dying organic matter. It is {{commonly found in}} gardens and farm areas enriched with manure, near well-decayed stumps and <b>logs,</b> <b>and</b> in wood chips. A Japanese publication mentioned its occurrence in Takatsuki and Osaka-fu, where it fruited in November and December on the ground along paths or in open spaces, under or near bamboo (Phyllostachys bambusoides) and hardwoods such as the Sawtooth Oak, the Japanese Zelkova, and the Camphor tree.|$|E
5|$|Mycena maculata bears some {{resemblance}} to M.inclinata, but is only associated with decaying hardwood <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> stumps, and {{is found in}} eastern North America, and sometimes on oak on the West Coast. In age, it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in M.inclinata. M.inclinata is often confused with the edible M.galericulata, a common species that is variable in cap color, size and shape. M.galericulata typically has a bluntly conical cap that is dull gray-brown, and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross-veins. M.polygramma has a ridged stem that is bluish-gray.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 registered N110AA. It {{had been}} delivered on February 25, 1972, {{and at the}} time of the crash, it had logged just under 20,000 hours of flying time over seven years. The jet was powered by three General Electric CF6-6D engines. A review of the aircraft's flight <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> maintenance records showed that no mechanical discrepancies were noted for May 11, 1979. On the day of the accident, in violation of standard procedure, the records were not removed from the aircraft, and were destroyed in the accident.|$|E
5|$|The backstory is {{explained}} progressively through the player's acquisition of audio <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> encounters with ghostly apparitions. At {{the beginning of}} the game, the player chooses a career in a branch of the Unified National Nominate, a fictional military organization. Each branch of service gives the player a set of starting bonuses composed of certain skills, though may thereafter freely develop as the player chooses. The Marine begins with bonuses to weaponry, the Navy officer is skilled in repairing and hacking, and the OSA agent gets a starting set of psionic powers.|$|E
5|$|The most {{widespread}} {{species is}} the brown bear, which occurs from Western Europe eastwards through Asia {{to the western}} areas of North America. The American black bear is restricted to North America, and the polar bear is restricted to the Arctic Sea. All the remaining species of bear are Asian. They occur {{in a range of}} habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest, both coniferous and broadleaf forests, prairies, steppes, montane grassland, alpine scree slopes, Arctic tundra {{and in the case of}} the polar bear, ice floes. Bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves, hollow <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> dense vegetation for shelter.|$|E

For classified reasons, Quinn has ordered Remmick to perform {{an investigation of the}} Enterprise and its crew and expects Picard to fully co-operate. Remmick's query causes tension in the crew, particularly when he questions the trustworthiness of the senior staff based on their personal <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> past actions. A young cadet, having failed the Starfleet Academy entrance examination, attempts to run away in a shuttlecraft but ends up drifting. Picard is able to direct the cadet to pilot the shuttle away from a planet by bouncing off the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Durian {{fruit is}} used to flavour {{a wide variety of}} sweet edibles such as {{traditional}} Malay candy, ice kacang, dodol, lempuk, rose biscuits, ice cream, milkshakes, mooncakes, Yule <b>logs,</b> <b>and</b> cappuccino. Es durian (durian ice cream) is a popular dessert in Indonesia, sold at street side stall in Indonesian cities, especially in Java. Pulut Durian or ketan durian is glutinous rice steamed with coconut milk and served with ripened durian. In Sabah, red durian is fried with onions and chilli and served as a side dish. Red-fleshed durian is traditionally added to sayur, an Indonesian soup made from freshwater fish. Ikan brengkes tempoyak is fish cooked in a durian-based sauce, traditional in Sumatra. Dried durian flesh can be made into kripik durian (durian chips).|$|E
5|$|General McDowell then ordered Shelby and Clarke to take Musgrove's Mill, a British encampment on the Enoree River. They rode {{all night}} with two hundred men, {{reaching}} their location about dawn on August 18, 1780. The colonists had estimated the enemy force was of comparable size, but an advance scout brought word there were approximately 500 British soldiers in the camp who were preparing for battle. Shelby's men and horses were too tired for a retreat and they had lost the element of surprise. He ordered his men to construct a breastwork from nearby <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> brush. In half an hour the makeshift fortifications were complete, and twenty-five colonial riders charged the British camp to provoke the attack. The British pursued {{them back to the}} main colonial force. Despite being outnumbered, the colonists killed several British officers and put their army to flight.|$|E

5|$|In North America, {{the fungus}} has been {{recorded}} in North Carolina, Tennessee, New York, Michigan, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, California, Virginia, and South Dakota. In Canada, {{it has been found}} in Ontario. Smith noted that collections from Michigan are likely to be found on old hemlock knots lying in the soil, where it usually fruits singly; it tends to grow in clusters on <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> stumps. In Europe, it {{has been recorded}} from Britain, Scotland, the Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, and Turkey. In the UK, the fungus is commonly found in Caledonian pine woods, and it is considered an indicator species for that habitat type.|$|E
5|$|In Petrified Forest National Park, most of {{the logs}} in the park {{retained}} their original external form during petrification but lost their internal structure. However, {{a small fraction of}} the <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> {{most of the}} park’s petrified animal bones have cells and other spaces that are mineral-filled but still retain much of their original organic structure. With these permineralized fossils, it is possible to study the cellular make-up of the original organisms with the aid of a microscope. Other organic matter—typically leaves, seeds, cones, pollen grains, spores, small stems, and fish, insect, and animal remains—have been preserved in the park as compression fossils, flattened by the weight of the sediments above until only a thin film remains in the rock.|$|E

5|$|M. inquilina is {{only found}} in the {{south-west}} of Western Australia, with the holotype collected 225 kilometres (140 miles) from Perth. M. inquilina occurs in colonies with M. vindex and M. nigriceps, found in soil, under <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> flat rocks in woodland. They are commonly found in granite outcrops and wooded areas, with trees such as Corymbia calophylla, Acacia acuminata and a large unidentified species of Allocasuarina (possibly Allocasuarina huegeliana) present. The type locality was in an area cleared for agricultural purposes, but some areas were still wooded; many fallen large trees were present. M. inquilina is typically found deep inside the nests, around 25 centimetres (10 inches) {{and can be found}} next to the queen.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galericulata is saprobic, {{and grows}} on {{decaying}} hardwood and softwood sticks, chips, <b>logs,</b> <b>and</b> stumps. It can also grow from submerged wood, which may {{give it a}} terrestrial appearance. It typically grows in small clusters or sometimes singly. The fungus fruits from late spring to early winter. A study of litter-decomposing fungi in a coniferous forest in Finland showed that M.galericulata produces extracellular hydrolytic enzymes in the humus and eluvial soil, including β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, α-glucosidase, butyrate esterase and sulphatase. The enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic particles in the soil and break down (depolymerize) biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, which contributes to the cycling of carbon and nutrients. The presence of lead contamination in the soil decreases both the growth and the extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity of M.galericulata.|$|E
