The three-dimensional model of the <b>ladle</b> <b>turret</b> parts were constructed with the 3 D digital modeling technology. The models of main subassembly that need to be checked were digitally assembled imitatively. The key forcing parts were FEM Meshed and analyzed the stress and the displacement. The verify check results show that the coefficient of safety of the equipment is large enough for the ladle capacity raised from 300 t to 320 t without changing the structure of <b>ladle</b> <b>turret.</b> It can meet the strength requirement after the ladle capacity was extended. The digital assembled model of the equipment can also be used for further digital mechanism analysis...|$|E
