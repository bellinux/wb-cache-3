40|$|This study {{investigated}} the role of phonetics for children learning to read Chinese. Participants were 45 Chinese first graders and 45 second graders recruited in Hong Kong. The study revealed that children name phonologically regular Chinese characters more accurately than irregular ones, and phonetic-related errors were the most dominant type in reading Chinese characters and words. There were statistically significant correlations among Chinese pseudocharacter reading. Chinese real character reading, and rhyme detection for the first graders. These findings suggested that Chinese first and second graders do rely on phonetics for sound cues in naming Chinese characters, and phonological awareness seemed {{to be important in}} learning these script-sound regularities in Chinese. It therefore appeared that beyond the <b>logographic</b> <b>phase,</b> there was also a phonological phase in learning to read Chinese. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of phonological awareness and visual-orthographic skills in Chinese reading acquisition. The subjects were 154 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, and 5 th graders in Beijing who had learned an alphabetic script known as Hanyu Pinyin to help read Chinese characters. Children's performance on tests of various cognitive skills, reading ability, and pinyin knowledge were examined. Results of hierarchical regression analyses showed that (a) visual skills predicted reading success at lower grades; (b) pinyin knowledge {{and the ability to}} discriminate homophonic characters predicted reading success in Grades 2, 3, and 5; and (c) onset-rime awareness, but not phonemic awareness, predicted Chinese reading. This suggests that learning to read Chinese progresses from a <b>logographic</b> <b>phase</b> to an orthographic-phonological phase and that the nature of phonological awareness predicting reading success is contingent on the characteristics of the writing system. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between spoken and written language difficulties. Two children aged eleven and twelve years were studied. Both were of average intelligence but had a persisting speech difficulty of a dyspraxic nature. Normal control data was collected on each area tested so that the casescould be viewed from a developmental perspective. First, {{a detailed analysis of}} speech errors was carried out. Compared to Articulation Age matched controls, the speech disordered children made multiple errors, had difficulty assembling the articulatory programme for unfamiliar words and relied upon word specific knowledge. Second, on tests of auditory discrimination, lexical decision and segmentation skills, the speech disordered children performed less well than Reading Age matched controls. Their difficulties were most pronounced in the auditory modality and when non word material was used. Third, their reading and spelling performance was compared to low Reading Age dyslexic children without obvious speech difficulties. The speech disordered children were more deficient in their use of phonological strategies and had not broken through to the alphabetic phase of literacy development. The cases were followed up after three years. Although the children had improved their performance quantitatively, they still exhibited the same pattern of errors overall. They had become "trapped" in the <b>logographic</b> <b>phase</b> of literacy development and were adopting compensatory strategies when reading and spelling. Their pervasive phonological difficulties were compounded by their inconsistent and incoordinated speech. These findings challenge the traditional view of Developmental Verbal Dyspraxia as a motor speech disorder. In addition to their articulatory difficulties, the children also had auditory processing and lexical problems. The findings allow further discussion of the role of articulatory and phonological skills in literacy development. A model of reading and spelling strategies is presented and the points where speech and language disordered children are most at risk, are indicated. Finally, the clinical, educational and research implications are outlined...|$|E
