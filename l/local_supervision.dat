5|$|The {{population}} of China {{doubled in size}} during the 10th and 11th centuries. This growth {{was made possible by}} expanded rice cultivation in central and southern Song, the use of early-ripening rice from south-east and southern Asia, and the production of widespread food surpluses. The Northern Song census recorded a {{population of}} roughly 50 million, much like the Han and Tang dynasties. This data is found in the Standard Histories. However, it is estimated that the Northern Song had a population of some 100 million people, and 200 million {{by the time of the}} Ming dynasty. This dramatic increase of population fomented an economic revolution in pre-modern China. The expansion of the population, growth of cities, and the emergence of a national economy led to the gradual withdrawal of the central government from direct involvement in economic affairs. The lower gentry assumed a larger role in grassroots administration and local affairs. Appointed officials in county and provincial centers relied upon the scholarly gentry for their services, sponsorship, and <b>local</b> <b>supervision.</b>|$|E

60|$|Such {{is a short}} {{sketch of}} an Ordinance which seems, to me at least, a {{rational}} and fair compromise, identical, mutatis mutandis, with that embodied in Mr. Forster's new Education Act; {{and the only one}} by which the lower orders of Trinidad were likely to get any education whatever. It was received, of course, with applause by the Roman Catholics, and by a great number of the Protestants of the colony. But, as was to be expected, it met with strong expressions of dissent from some of the Protestant gentry and clergy; especially from one gentleman, who attacked the new scheme with an acuteness and humour which made even those who differed from him regret that such remarkable talents had no wider sphere than a little island of forty-five miles by sixty. An accession of power to the Roman Catholic clergy was, of course, dreaded; and all the more because it was known that the scheme met with the approval of the Archbishop; that it was, indeed, a compromise with the requests made in a petition which that prelate had lately sent in to the Governor; a petition which seems to me most rational and temperate. It was argued, too, that though the existing Act--that of 1851--had more or less failed, it might still succeed if Lord Harris's plan was fully carried out, and the choice of the ward schoolmaster, the selection of ward school-books, and the direction of the course of instruction, were vested in local committees. The simple answer was, that eighteen years had elapsed, and the colony had done nothing in that direction; that the great majority of children in the island did not go to school at all, while those who did attended most irregularly, and learnt little or nothing; {290} that the secular system of education had not attracted, as it was hoped, the children of the Hindoo immigrants, of whom scarcely one was to be found in a ward school; that the ward schoolmasters were generally inefficient, and the Central Board of Education inactive; that there was no rigorous <b>local</b> <b>supervision,</b> and no local interest felt in the schools; that there were fewer children in the ward schools in 1868 than there had been in 1863, in spite of the rapid increase of population: and all this for the simple reason which the Archbishop had pointed out--the want of religious instruction. As was to be expected, the good people of the island, being most of them religious people also, felt no enthusiasm about schools where little was likely to be taught beyond the three royal R's.|$|E

50|$|A {{few other}} hardy investors added similar homesites and finally Mr & Mrs Joseph Casey, of Rhode Island, joined with Koutnik to start {{construction}} of a hotel and surrounding rental villas. Unfortunately, Mr. Koutnik ran out of funds and eventually the Caseys {{took control of the}} project. However, the planned construction was never completed and only the rudimentary foundations and walls were left for years - unfinished. After Mr. Casey's death from cancer, his widow, Gertrude, offered the Eilers a lease on the entire island so that they could complete construction and operate the only private island resort in Jamaica - The Admiralty Club. After five years of operation, a disgruntled employee who was fired because he was stealing funds riled up the entire staff and took over the island. The staff commandeered the two boats used to ferry guests to the island and held the Eilers at bay until they received all their termination pay. After this terrifying experience, the Eilers left the island within a week and it was allowed to operate under <b>local</b> <b>supervision</b> by Mrs. Casey. In time, other investors became interested; however, a stipulation which required that anyone could make available to themselves the amenities of the resort as if they were a guest makes it undesirable to operate as an upscale resort. In addition, there is provision for a Public Beach right amid the circle of rental villas which destroys any privacy for private use. This results in dissuading investors to proceed with the island's development.|$|E

For the good of such institutes and to provide for the needs of their apostolate, the Holy See may exempt them from the governance of the local Bishops, bringing them entirely under the authority of the Holy See itself or of someone else.
