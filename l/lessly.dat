6000|$|The {{consequence}} of my leaving {{to the last}} my little mention of Loches is that space and opportunity fail me; and yet a brief and hurried account of that extra- ordinary spot would after all be in best agreement with my visit. We snatched a fearful joy, my companion and I, the afternoon we took the train for Loches. The weather this time had been terribly against us: again and again a day that promised fair became hope- <b>lessly</b> foul after lunch. At last we determined {{that if we could}} not make this excursion in the sunshine, we would make it with the aid of our umbrellas. We grasped them firmly and started for the station, where we were detained an unconscionable time by the evolu- tions, outside, of certain trains laden with liberated (and exhilarated) conscripts, who, their term of service ended, were about to be restored to civil life. The trains in Touraine are provoking; they serve as little as possible for excursions. If they convey you one way at the right hour, it is on the condition of bring- ing you back at the wrong; they either allow you far too little time to examine the castle or the ruin, or they leave you planted in front of it for periods that outlast curiosity. They are perverse, capricious, ex- asperating. It was a question of our having but an hour or two at Loches, and we could ill afford to sacri- fice to accidents. One of the accidents, however, was that the rain stopped before we got there, leaving be- hind it a moist mildness of temperature and a cool and lowering sky, which were in perfect agreement with the gray old city. Loches is certainly one of the greatest impressions of the traveller in central France, - the largest cluster of curious things that presents itself to his sight. It rises above the valley of the Indre, the charming stream set in meadows and sedges, which wanders through the province of Berry and through many of the novels of Madame George Sand; lifting from the summit of a hill, which it covers to the base, a confusion of terraces, ramparts, towers, and spires. Having but little time, as I say, we scaled the hill amain, and wandered briskly through this labyrinth of antiquities. The rain had decidedly stopped, and save that we had our train on our minds, we saw Loches to the best advantage. We enjoyed that sensation with which the conscientious tourist is - or ought to be - well acquainted, and for which, at any rate, he has a formula in his rough-and-ready language. We [...] "experienced," [...] as they say, (most odious of verbs!) an [...] "agreeable disappointment." [...] We were surprised and delighted; we had not suspected that Loches was so good.|$|E

5000|$|By some accounts, Lord Fairfax and Leven also {{fled the}} {{battlefield}} with their routed troops, {{but this has}} recently been challenged, certainly in Leven's case. The most detailed account of Leven's flight was written by the biographer of Lieutenant Colonel James Somerville, who {{was present at the}} battle as a volunteer. However, this second hand account was published only in 1679, and has been challenged by previously unused eye witness accounts. These show most of the Covenanter infantry and cavalry units remained fighting {{until the end of the}} battle. As seven different eyewitnesses attested, they did so under the direction of Leven. For example, Simeon Ashe (the Earl of Manchester's chaplain) noted that: The Earl of Manchester’s new levied Forces began to give backe, the Enemey pursued our men, fell on again and gained two peeces of ordnance there; Rupert fell upon Sir Thomas Fairfaxes horse, and there was a very hot fight, many slayne on both sides: our forces retreated, but ralleing our men again and General <b>Lessly</b> coming on with his foot, they fell on furiously, many were killed on both sides, and then the enemy beginning to retreat, our men followed pursuing and totally Routed Rupert.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I begin with Schleiermacher review {{and analyze the}} origins of the Humboldtian model of the modern German {{university}} as an influential kind of institution that was adopted in many parts of Europe, the US and beyond. The novel of education and of ethical self-formation came to provide a novelistic depicted of the essential human becoming of the hero protagonist and engendered a new genre that spread throughout the world. The paper asks the question where and what might be the novel of the neoliberal university in an age when the humanistic requirement has fallen away and students have become “customers” purchasing an educational service. Is there a novel of the neoliberal university that does not end- <b>lessly</b> replicate the logic of the marketplace but actually intervenes in material reality to “save” the institution?

40|$|A mid Ming {{watercolour}} navigation {{map that}} has been overlooked for more than 350 years has recently been discovered at Bodleian Library of Oxford University in UK. It is the first extant watercolour navigation map in the maritime history of China, and very likely it was produced {{from the hands of}} Hokkien maritime merchants of Ming dynasty. It is from the private collection of John Selden （ 1584 - 1654 ）, a well -known British lawyer, and was donated to the Bodleian Library in 1659. This unofficial map is very large, approximately lxl. 5 m. It depicts the vast region from Siberia in the north to Java and Maluku Islands （Spice Islands） in the south, and from Japan and the Philippines in the east to Burma and South India in the west. In addition, six East Ocean navigation routes and twelve West Ocean navigation routes are clearly marked on the map. Doubt- <b>lessly</b> this map is very important in terms of studying maritime trade of Chinese junks in the period of Ming and Qing. 英国牛津大学鲍德林图书馆（Bodleian Library）近来发现了一幅被人们忽略了长达 350 余年之久的、绘制于中国明朝中叶的彩色航海地图。这是中国历史上现存的第一幅手工绘制的彩色航海图，而且或许是一幅出自明朝福建海商之手的地图。这幅航海图来自于英国一位著名的律师约翰·雪尔登（John Selden， 1584 — 1654 ）的私人收藏，并于 1659 年捐献给了牛津大学鲍德林图书馆。该图相当大，大约长 1 ． 5 米，宽 1 米。该图绘制的地域北起西伯利亚，南至今印尼爪哇岛和马鲁古群岛（香料群岛），东达北部的日本列岛和南部的菲律宾群岛，西抵缅甸和南印度。航海图上清楚地绘制出了明朝中叶中国帆船经常使用的 6 条东洋航路和 12 条西洋航路，对研究明清时期中国帆船的海外贸易具有重要的参考价值...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new DEVS/NS- 2 {{modeling and simulation}} environment which supports both high {{and low levels of}} abstraction for network m odeling and sim ulation. DEVS (Discrete Even t System Specification) is a well-defined m athematical f ormalism specif ication for structure and behavior of dynamic system s. The NS- 2 is a discre te event network simulator, whose primary use is intended to build and run various detailed network m odels and protocols such as TCP/IP, satellite links, and wireless networks. By combining the two powerful modeling and simulation systems, the significant benefits attained by the interoperabl e sim ulation of DEVS and NS- 2 are reduction of the cost, increased hi gh and low level m odeling power, and enhanced r eusability.

40|$|Kiamilev, Fouad E. In recent years, rapid {{development}} of wireless communication systems has en- abled developers {{to design and}} increase the connectivity of devices within the home environment. At the same time, smart methods for lowering power consumption have been studied to help combat rising energy costs. This thesis presents the design and implementation of an energy smart wire- <b>lessly</b> controllable home automation network. The design consists of a base station that has an FPGA, acting as a coprocessor, running a Linux distribution on the Xilinx MicroBlaze soft core. The FPGA has many peripherals including Ethernet connectivity and allows for further prototyping of possible communication meth- ods. Also connected to the FPGA is a ZigBee 802. 15. 4 wireless radio which allows for data to be passed between ZigBee wireless networks to coordinate turning items within the house on and off. This is accomplished by tracking a user through a house using a wearable wireless beacon and automating power saving responses. A simple prototype of the design is implemented using simple electrical devices for validating the basic functions and testing has shown successful results were achieved. The overall goal of the project is to learn to design an embedded system from scratch and have a platform {{that can be used}} as an educational module for future projects, implementations and modi cations.

40|$|That a load {{balancing}} strategy using stale information care <b>lessly</b> will incur system performance degradation {{is easy to}} verify. However {{it is not so}} obvious that routing a customer to the expected shortest queue has the same problem when information for decision is stale. We consider a queueing system with a load balancer and a pool of identical FCFS queues in parallel. The arrival process is assumed to be Poisson and the service times have identical independent exponential distributions. The pool of servers informs the load balancer the number of customers in each server at some regularly spaced time instances. The load balancer routes each customer to the expected shortest queue based on available stale information and elapsed time since the last time instance of system sate information updating. The system performance analysis of this type of model is usu ally difficult because the involved state space is very large. However when taking the number of servers to the infinite limit, we have a set of differential equations which is easier to handle than the finite case. Using the approximation of infinite number of severs, we show that the average wait ing time for the system is not always minimized by routing each customer to the expected shortest queue when infor mation for decision is stale...|$|E
40|$|Continuing {{progress}} in microelectronics {{has allowed the}} embedding of sensing, processing, and wireless communications capabilities in familiar physical objects. This enables the creation of smart environments, where communication and computation technologies facilitate interactions between people and their surroundings, instead of just person-to-person or person-to-server communication. In a collaborative project underway at the University of California, Los Angeles, called Smart Kindergarten (SmartKG), 1 we are exploring these technologies in a sensor-instrumented environment for early Exploring communication between childhood education. Spatially dense but unobtrusive sensors people and their physical continually capture interactions environment, the Smart among students, teachers, and Kindergarten project addresses the common classroom objects.

The system will help teachers evaluate both student progress (for example, “How well is student A reading storybook B? ” or “Is student C having trouble with a given learning area?”) and social behavior (for example, “Does student A confront other students? ” or “Is student B usually isolated?”). We designed SmartKG’s infrastructure to collect, manage, and fuse sensor data, aiding information interpretation and presentation in a user-friendly manner.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{analysed}} fecal bacterial communities and parasites of three important Indonesian fish species, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus, Epinephelus sexfasciatus and Atule mate. We then compared the biodiversity of bacterial communities and parasites of these three fish species collected in highly polluted Jakarta Bay with those collected in less polluted Indonesian areas of Cilacap (E. sexfasciatus, A. mate) and Thousand Islands (E. fuscoguttatus). In addition, E. fuscoguttatus from net cages in an open water mariculture facility was compared with free living E. fuscoguttatus from its surroundings. Both core and shared microbiomes were investigated. Our results reveal that, while the core microbiomes of all three fish species were composed of fairly the same classes of bacteria, the proportions of these bacterial classes strongly varied. The microbial composition of phylogenetically distant fish species, i. e. A. mate and E. sexfasciatus from Jakarta Bay and Cilacap were more closely related than the microbial composition of more phylogentically closer species, i. e. E. fuscoguttatus, E. sexfasciatus from Jakarta Bay, Cilacap and Thousand Islands. In addition, we detected a weak negative correlation between the load of selected bacterial pathogens, i. e. Vibrio sp. and Photobacterium sp. {{and the number of}} endoparasites. In the case of Flavobacterium sp. the opposite was observed, i. e. a weak positive correlation. Of the three recorded pathogenic bacterial genera, Vibrio sp. was commonly found in E. fuscoguttatus from mariculture, and <b>lessly</b> {{in the vicinity of the}} net cages and rarely in the fishes from the heavily polluted waters from Jakarta Bay. Flavobacterium sp. showed higher counts in mariculture fish and Photobacteria sp. was the most prominent in fish inside and close to the net cages.
