40|$|We {{develop a}} {{nonlinear}} dynamic {{general equilibrium model}} with a banking sector {{and use it to}} study the macroeconomic impact of introducing a minimum <b>liquidity</b> <b>standard</b> for banks on top of existing capital adequacy requirements. The model gen-erates a distribution of bank sizes arising from differences in banks ’ ability to generate revenue from a given quantity of loans and from occasionally binding capital and liquid-ity constraints. In equilibrium, the buffers of capital and liquidity above the required minimums are also endogenous. Under our baseline calibration, imposing a liquidity requirement would lead to a steady-state decrease of about 5 percent in the amount of loans made, an increase in banks ’ securities holdings of at least 12 percent, a fall in the interest rate on securities of about 25 basis points, and declines in output and consumption of about 1. 0 percent and 0. 6 percent, respectively. However, introducing a minimum liquidity requirement increases risk-based capital ratios, allowing banks to better withstand the impact of shocks to capital. Finally, our results are sensitive to the supply of safe assets. In particular, the larger the supply of securities, the smaller the macroeconomic impact of introducing a minimum <b>liquidity</b> <b>standard</b> for banks, all else being equal...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{outbreak}} of the global financial crisis, regulators have increased their focus on the ability of banks to measure and manage liquidity risk. In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) identified ineffective liquidity management as a key characteristic of the crisis and highlighted the lack of attention that liquidity risk received relative to other risks prior to the crisis. Recognizing the key role of illiquidity in the crisis, the Basel Committee included two global minimum <b>liquidity</b> <b>standards</b> as part of the recently announced Basel III supervisory framework to be implemented over the next seven years.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{study how}} the Federal Reserve affects {{financial}} market valuations and stock market liquidity. My work relates to previous literature that uses monetary policy tools to explain stock market liquidity and stock market volatility. Previous research confirms that monetary policy affects equity valuations and risk-aversion of investors. Austrian school theory views business cycles as {{a symptom of}} central bank interventionism in credit market and monetary field. Contribution of this thesis is to provide explanation on transmission mechanism of monetary policy to financial market valuations. Emphasis is on employing stock market liquidity as a transmission channel of monetary policy. I calculate how the Federal Reserve's short term rate has diverged from Taylor rule -implied rate, and define divergences from Taylor rule as expansive or restrictive monetary policy. I use Q-ratio to measure financial market valuations, which is a ratio between U. S. corporate equities and U. S. corporate net worth. I define stock market liquidity as price impact to dollar volume trading in NYSE/Amex stocks. Data spans from 1954 to 2007. My first new finding shows that monetary policy affects stock market <b>liquidity.</b> <b>Standard</b> deviation effect of monetary policy increases stock market liquidity during two quarters, and explains 54. 3 % of variation when controlling for autocorrelation. Second new finding shows that stock market liquidity affects financial market valuations. Standard deviation increase on stock market liquidity increases level changes in Q-ratio by 4. 78 %, and decreases by 4. 9 % in previous quarter. Effects are large compared to sample mean (1. 57 %), and explains 18. 5 % {{of the variation in}} Q-ratio levels. Results hold for numerous robustness tests. Parameter stability test shows that the estimated coefficients for my key findings are stable over time. I employ VAR -model for key variables to study joint movement of monetary policy, stock market liquidity, and Q-ratio. Based on this model, Granger causality -test shows that these variables Granger cause each other. Impulse response functions also confirm same effects I find for my new findings...|$|E
40|$|The Basel III Leverage Ratio, as {{originally}} agreed upon in December 2010, has recently undergone revisions and updates – both {{in relation to}} those proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision – as well as proposals introduced in the United States. Whilst recent proposals have been introduced by the Basel Committee to improve, particularly, the denominator component of the Leverage Ratio, new requirements have been introduced in the U. S to upgrade and increase these ratios, and it is those updates which relate to the Basel III Supplementary Leverage Ratio that have primarily generated a lot of interests. This is attributed not only to concerns that many subsidiaries of US Bank Holding Companies (BHCs) will find it cumbersome to meet such requirements, but also to potential or possible increases in regulatory capital arbitrage: a phenomenon which plagued {{the era of the}} original 1988 Basel Capital Accord and which also partially provided impetus for the introduction of Basel II. This paper is aimed at providing an analysis of the recent updates which have taken place in respect of the Basel III Leverage Ratio and the Basel III Supplementary Leverage Ratio – both in respect of recent amendments introduced by the Basel Committee and proposals introduced in the United States. It will also consider the consequences – as well as the impact - which the U. S Leverage ratios could have on Basel III. There are ongoing debates in relation to revision by the Basel Committee, as well as the most recent U. S proposals to update Basel III Leverage ratios and whilst these revisions have been welcomed to a large extent, in view of the need to address Tier One capital requirements and exposure criteria, there is every likelihood, indication, as well as tendency that many global systemically important banks (GSIBS), and particularly their subsidiaries, will resort to capital arbitrage. What {{is likely to be the}} impact of the recent proposals in the U. S. ? The recent U. S proposals are certainly very encouraging and should also serve as impetus for other jurisdictions to adopt a pro-active approach – particularly where existing ratios or standards appear to be inadequate. This paper also adopts the approach of evaluating the causes and consequences of the most recent updates by the Basel Committee, as well as those revisions which have taken place in the U. S, by attempting to balance the merits of the respective legislative updates and proposals. The value of adopting leverage ratios as a supplementary regulatory tool will also be illustrated by way of reference to the impact of the recent legislative changes on risk taking activities, as well as the need to also supplement capital adequacy requirements with the Basel Leverage ratios and the Basel <b>liquidity</b> <b>standard...</b>|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD. (Economics) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2013 Some {{financial}} {{experts have}} blamed deficiencies in Basel II capital regulation for the exacerbation of financial crises in 2007 to 2012. In response to this, new proposals {{in the form}} of Basel III attempt to raise the quality, consistency and transparency of the regulatory capital base in order to enhance the risk coverage of Basel II via appropriate ratios. In this article, the authors explore how the new Basel <b>liquidity</b> <b>standards,</b> as encapsulated by the liquid coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR), could be effectively implemented in mitigating liquidity problems. In order to partially accomplish this, they consider a solution paradigm for proposed Basel III liquidity regulation. The authors also consider the potential benefits and challenges of this regulation in terms of <b>liquidity</b> <b>standards,</b> crisis prevention, financial markets and institutions, liquidity and other risks, as well as the broader economy. For instance, conclusions are that higher LCRs mitigate liquidity risk and the NSFR limits an over-reliance on short-term wholesale funding. However, their overall impression is that Basel III has not fully addressed the factors that were responsible for the crises and the fundamental problems with previous Basel regulation.

50|$|The role of Basel II, {{both before}} and after the global {{financial}} crisis, has been discussed widely. While some argue that the crisis demonstrated weaknesses in the framework, others have criticized it for actually increasing the effect of the crisis. In response to the financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published revised global standards, popularly known as Basel III. The Committee claimed that the new standards would lead to a better quality of capital, increased coverage of risk for capital market activities and better <b>liquidity</b> <b>standards</b> among other benefits.|$|R
40|$|Liquidity {{transformation}} is a pre-eminent {{function of the}} banking system. By utilising at-call deposits to fund long-term and illiquid loans, and by making funds available to depositors and borrowers upon demand, banks contribute to economic welfare. However, liquidity transformation exposes banks to significant risks. As banks do not choose to hold socially optimal liquidity exposures on their own, bank regulations are an important tool for enhancing the safety of individual banks and improving {{the stability of the}} financial system. This thesis sheds new light on the causes of liquidity risk by examining the supervisory liquidity risk ratings of Australian deposit-taking institutions. It is shown that liquidity risk ratings are predictable and that the Basel III liquidity regulations are likely to reduce risk in the banking system. By conducting the first microeconomic cost-benefit analysis of the Basel III <b>liquidity</b> <b>standards,</b> this thesis also illustrates that the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) have net social benefits under a range of reasonable assumptions. This is particularly important as past macroeconomic cost-benefit analyses of Basel III <b>liquidity</b> <b>standards</b> are shown to be misspecified and potentially spurious.

40|$|During {{the recent}} Financial Crisis, {{as well as}} the 2010 and ongoing European Sovereign Debt Crisis, several governments had/have had to raise their debt levels in order to {{stabilize}} their economies. The principal problem attributed to sovereign debts, which is linked to their characteristics, is the possibility of defaults occurring in relation to these – since they are usually accompanied without collaterals. The possibilities of such defaults occurring are further increased where bailouts are granted in relation to these debts. Increased doubts in relation to the likelihood of larger sovereigns “rolling over maturing debt on their own”, {{as well as the}} consequential occurrence of “very high, economically penalizing, interest rates”, is considered to be the present reality. As well as a consideration of improvements which have been introduced through Basel III in respect of prudential supervisory tools (supervisory tools such as capital, liquidity requirements, and macro prudential policy tools), and an analysis of recent efforts which have been undertaken by the Basel Committee to address information gaps in derivative markets (a source of huge losses to many major banks), the paper also explores how the new Basel <b>liquidity</b> <b>standards</b> (that is, the Liquid Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), could be effectively implemented in mitigating sovereign debt crises.

40|$|In {{response}} to the 2007 - 08 financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed two <b>liquidity</b> <b>standards</b> to reinforce banks’ resilience to liquidity risks. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the impact of liquidity regulation on bank behavior. The first of four main chapters analyzes the development of global <b>liquidity</b> <b>standards,</b> their objectives {{as well as their}} interaction with capital standards. The analysis suggests that regulating capital is associated with declining liquidity buffers. The interaction of liquidity regulation and monetary policy, the view that regulating capital also addresses liquidity risks as well as a lack of supervisory momentum were important factors hampering the harmonization of liquidity regulation. Chapter 3 takes a wide view on the impact of liquidity regulation on banks' liquidity management. The key question is whether the presence of liquidity regulation substitutes banks' incentives to hold liquid assets. The cross-country analysis suggests that most bank-specific and country-specific determinants of banks’ liquidity buffers are substituted by liquidity regulation while a bank's disclosure requirements become more important. The complementary nature of disclosure and liquidity requirements provides a strong rationale for considering them jointly in the design of regulation. Chapter 4 zooms in on one of the key questions regarding the interaction of the LCR with monetary policy transmission. The analysis shows that a liquidity requirement causes short-term and long-term interest rates as well as demand for long-term loans to increase. However, banks do not seem able to pass on the increased funding costs in the interbank market to their private sector clients. Rather, a liquidity requirement seems to decrease banks' interest margins, which might require central banks to use a representative real economy interest rate as additional target for monetary policy implementation. Chapter 5 is motivated by the European sovereign debt crisis and analyzes the impact of preferential regulatory treatment on banks’ demand for government bonds. The analysis suggests that preferential treatment in liquidity and capital regulation increases banks' demand for government bonds beyond their own risk appetite. Liquidity and capital regulation also seem to incentivize banks to substitute other bonds with government bonds. The thesis concludes with an epilogue on liquidity stress testing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{contributes}} in {{a quantitative}} manner {{to the debate}} on macroprudential policy in three ways. First, it illustrates how macroprudential surveillance could have been better undertaken with a highly stable crisis-prediction model for 14 OECD countries estimated over 1980 - 1997. Second, in terms of macroprudential regulation, it uses the related estimates to calibrate the increase in capital and liquidity needed to reduce average crisis probabilities to a desired level, as is being discussed in Basel. We show that an international consensus on regulatory changes will generate “winners ” and “losers ” in terms of capital and liquidity adjustments, and we suggest that raising capital and <b>liquidity</b> <b>standards</b> by 3. 7 percentage points across the board will reduce the annual average probability of a financial crisis to around 1 %. Finally, we show that countercyclical macroprudential policy is best calibrated on house prices and current accounts rather than GDP and credit, as are widely recommended at present. Credit growth, for example, has neither a direct nor an indirect statistical impact on crisis risk.

Under deregulatory conditions the competitive position of banks has toughened, and they reacted to it by intensifying: marketization, i. e. globalization, concentration, securitization and conglomeration, and by turning to the profit-oriented risk management of their activity. The contraction of their interest margin was thus neutralized by the reduction of operational costs and loss provisions, and {{by an increase in}} non-interest revenues, thereby maintaining banking profitability. The recent crisis has pinpointed the necessity of firmer regulation or reregulation of the banking sector, aimed at reducing its systemic risk, {{the most important aspect of}} which being the stricter international banking capital and <b>liquidity</b> <b>standards,</b> along with the requirement to adequately treat systemically important banks. Reregulation should strengthen capitalization and liquidity; mitigate the volume, concentration, internationalization and business dispersion, hence improving the supervision of the banking sector, implying its lower, yet more stable profitability. Such an impact of the adopted section of targeted regulatory measures has been indicated by higher liquidity, lower globalization, slower concentration and securitization, and stabilization-oriented risk management activities of today's banks. Their growth and profitability have shrunk...|$|R
40|$|The paper finds that, given Australia's {{conservative}} approach {{in implementing the}} Basel II framework, Australian banks' headline capital ratios underestimate their capital strengths. Given their high capital quality and the progress in their funding profiles since the global financial crisis, the Australian banks are making good progress toward meeting the Basel III requirements, including the new <b>liquidity</b> <b>standards.</b> Stress tests calibrated on the Irish crisis experience show that the banks could withstand sizable shocks to their exposure to residential mortgages. However, combining residential mortgage shocks with corporate losses expected {{at the peak of}} the global financial crisis would put more pressure on Australian banks' capital. Therefore, it would be useful to consider the merits of higher capital requirements for systemically important domestic banks.
