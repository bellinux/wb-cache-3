50|$|Podarcis muralis (common <b>wall</b> <b>lizard)</b> is {{a species}} of lizard with a large {{distribution}} in Europe and well-established introduced populations in North America, where it is also called the European <b>wall</b> <b>lizard.</b> It can grow to about 20 cm in total length.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} endemic to Sicily and the Aegadian Islands, {{though it is}} absent from the northeastern part of Sicily. It frequents areas with lush {{vegetation}} {{on the edges of}} woodland, bushy slopes, pasture and cultivated land. It is often present in gardens, especially irrigated ones. In contrast to the Italian <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> it does not climb much and occupies more densely vegetated areas. It is the commonest <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> inland while the Italian <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> is the more common near the coast.|$|R

40|$|Three {{different}} lizard {{species can}} be found at the great pasture of Hajúbagos. These are the balkan or crimean <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> (Podarcis taurica), the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) and the green lizard (Lacerta viridis). All of them are protected by law in Hungary but while sand lizard and green lizard is common all over the country, the amount of the balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> is decreasing. The main cause of this regrettable possession is the habitat degradation and thus habitat loss. Namely balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> not only prefers but suffers open sand grasslands and these kinds of habitats are disappearing in Hungary. Due to the fact that the extensive animal grazing lost its importance, open sand pastures started to change, succession can be realized. Thus grass closing constantly what is favourable for sand lizard and green lizard. Furthermore sand <b>lizard</b> and balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> share roughly the same food source and moreover green lizard could possibly pass into a predator of balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> juveniles also. Therefore sand lizard and green lizard became competitors (or predators) of balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> and the proportion of the three species compared to each other is changing. My aim is to examine the vegetation change and simultaneously monitor the amount of the mentioned three lizard species. After all I would like to make a well established proposal on the management of protected grasslands...|$|R

50|$|The Iberian <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> forms part of {{a species}} complex of Podarcis <b>wall</b> <b>lizards</b> {{occurring}} in the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb region of North Africa.

50|$|Bocage's <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> {{grows to}} a snout-to-vent length of about 7 cm with a tail {{twice as long}} as this, males being larger than females. It is a sturdy lizard, {{somewhat}} flattened, and resembling Carbonell's <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> (Podarcis carbonelli). The dorsal surface is usually grey or yellowish-brown, but is sometimes green in males, copiously speckled with rows of dark markings. The flanks may be brownish or yellowish. The underparts are white, yellow, pink or orange but there are not any of the small blue spots {{along the edge of the}} belly often present in Carbonell's <b>wall</b> <b>lizard.</b>|$|R
50|$|Podarcis is a genus of lizards. Its members {{look very}} similar to lizards of the genus Lacerta, {{to which they were}} {{considered}} to belong until the 1970s. While similar externally and ecologically, Podarcis form a distinct group differing from Lacerta by the construction of the skull and the hemipenis, and by the processes of the caudal vertebrae. They are commonly known as <b>wall</b> <b>lizards.</b> They are native to Europe and northern Africa, and most species are restricted to the Mediterranean region. The Italian <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> and the common <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> have been introduced to North America.|$|R

Carbonell's <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> much resembles the closely related Bocage's <b>wall</b> <b>lizard,</b> but that species tends to have more clearly defined markings and a yellow, orange or pink belly, and lacks the blue spots.|$|R

The underparts are white with a spotted throat, but may be suffused with orange, pink or red in breeding males.
