Luca Badoer continued to be well behind the pace as he came in at 20th, 3.055 seconds behind session winner Adrian Sutil.|$|E
25|$|Direklerarası was a <b>little</b> <b>off</b> {{the beaten}} track and in {{comparison}} to Galata was a more refined center of entertainment. Direklerarası {{was said to be}} quite lively at night during the month of Ramadan (Ramazan in Turkish) and certainly once its attractions was its family atmosphere. It was here that the troupes of Kel Hasan and Abdi Efendi and later that of Neshid enjoyed a great popularity. It was under the influence of these masters that kanto experienced its golden years.|$|E

25|$|Grey Friar is a {{fell in the}} English Lake District, {{it is one of}} the Coniston Fells and is {{situated}} 13 kilometres west-south-west of Ambleside. It reaches a height of 770 metres (2,526 feet) and stands to the north west of the other Coniston Fells, a <b>little</b> <b>off</b> the beaten track and tends to be the least visited of the group. It is quite a large fell and forms the eastern wall of the Duddon Valley for several kilometres, in fact all drainage from Grey Friar goes to the Duddon Valley and not to Coniston Water.|$|E
25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a <b>little</b> <b>off</b> on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. I hate to say it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E

In [...] "Four Months Ago...", Elle admits to being {{diagnosed}} as a sociopath and previous to that, she had displayed sadistic behavior {{as a result of}} testing done to her as a child. Bell explains, [...] "Bodies are not able to take that much electricity and pain, and so Elle's psychologically a <b>little</b> <b>off</b> her rocker." [...] She is able to kill without apparent remorse, although in one instance, she reacts defensively when Mohinder asks her how many have died by her hand.|$|E

500|$|San Diego Opera first staged {{the work}} in 1993, but it was this company's 2004 production, {{designed}} by Zandra Rhodes, that generated new levels of enthusiasm for the opera throughout the United States. In the following few years this production was shown in seven other U.S. opera houses; in October 2008 James C. Whitson, in Opera News, reported that worldwide, [...] "between 2007 and 2009, half of all major production of the piece have been or will be ... in the U.S.". San Diego's director, Ian Campbell, suggested that his company's 2004 production was [...] "created {{at a time when}} it seemed many U.S. opera companies were looking for a not-too-expensive production with melody, and a <b>little</b> <b>off</b> the beaten track .... Les pêcheurs de perles fitted the bill.|$|E
500|$|Marmarosa {{began his}} {{professional}} career around 1941, joining the Johnny [...] "Scat" [...] Davis orchestra {{at the age}} of 15 or 16. He was first mentioned in the national jazz press the following year, appearing in Down Beat magazine for his playing at a jam session. After touring, the Davis orchestra disbanded, so Marmarosa and others then joined Gene Krupa around the end of 1942. After one 1943 Krupa performance in Philadelphia, Marmarosa was beaten into a coma by sailors who accused him of draft dodging. According to clarinetist Buddy DeFranco, who was also attacked by the men, [...] "Dodo was always a <b>little</b> <b>off</b> but he seemed different after that beating. The head injury didn't affect his playing, but I think it created psychological problems for him." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 21, Sidney Crosby {{surpassed the}} record for most All-Star Game votes at 1,020,736, set by Jaromir Jagr, then with the Penguins, in 2000. Crosby broke the record with 13days {{remaining}} in voting. Defenceman Ryan Whitney made his first appearance of the season on December 23, after missing 33games with a foot injury. On December 26, Marc-Andre Fleury made 37saves in Pittsburgh's first shutout of the season, defeating the New Jersey Devils, 1–0. After concluding the month with a 5–8–1 record, the team held a players-only meeting on December 30. [...] "The attitude is a <b>little</b> <b>off</b> right now," [...] said Brooks Orpik, [...] "It's easy {{to be a good}} team when you're winning games.

500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{called it}} [...] "a true movie milestone, {{presenting}} awe- and fear-inspiring sights {{never before seen}} on the screen... On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg's talents... t becomes less crisp on screen than {{it was on the}} page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away." [...] In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers described the film as [...] "colossal entertainment—the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year [...] Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed. Crichton and co-screenwriter David Koepp have flattened them into nonentities on the trip from page to screen." [...] Roger Ebert noted, [...] "The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values." [...] Henry Sheehan argued, [...] "The complaints over Jurassic Parks lack of story and character sound a <b>little</b> <b>off</b> the point," [...] pointing out the story arc of Grant learning to protect Hammond's grandchildren despite his initial dislike of them. Empire magazine gave the film five stars, hailing it as [...] "quite simply one of the greatest blockbusters of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviews {{praised the}} game's setting. GameSpy's David Chapman called it [...] "a truly {{remarkable}} experience. And, while {{the game itself}} may not have broken any new ground, the world it introduces more than makes up for that. It will leave gamers hungry for more." [...] According to Game Informer, [...] "in terms of gameplay quality, this may be another middle-of-the-road shooter, but the unique premise sets it aside from everything else out there." [...] Greg Bemis of G4TV wrote that the biggest draw in Darkwatch is the [...] "different enough" [...] setting that [...] "does fall back on tired video game clichés {{from time to time}} like big-breasted, leather-clad babes who speak in aggressive sexually suggestive double entendres, but it’s nice to see something--anything--that’s a <b>little</b> <b>off</b> the beaten path." [...] GameShark's Will Jayson Hill wrote that [...] "about the sharpest criticism that can be leveled at Darkwatch is that it really adds nothing original in the gameplay department. Aside from its extremely well executed western/horror environment, Darkwatch is a pretty generic FPS game with a weaker multiplayer mode." [...] On the other hand, some reviews thought that the gameplay was actually the strongest part of the game. Official UK PlayStation 2 Magazine stated Darkwatch [...] "has a few neat ideas but wins us over by doing solid shooting well. Fast-paced with cool guns, what's not to like?" [...] GameZone's Mike David wrote that only a [...] "weak plot pacing and that feeling that something is missing" [...] kept it from being given a score of 9/10.|$|E

2500|$|Reaction to the Charlottetown Conference varied {{among the}} {{different}} newspapers. [...] In the Maritimes there was concern that the smooth Canadians with their sparkling champagne and charming speeches were outsmarting the delegates of the smaller provinces. [...] "From all accounts {{it looks as if}} these [...] gentlemen had it all their own way; ... and that, what with their arguments and what with their blandishments, (they gave a champagne lunch on board the Victoria where Mr. McGee's wit sparkled brightly as the wine), they carried the Lower Province delegates a <b>little</b> <b>off</b> their feet." ...|$|E

2500|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{said of the}} episode, [...] "The {{dialogue}} in tonight's episode was flat and sometimes ridiculous but not necessarily because of the subject at hand. Some silliness is expected from a series about fairy tales, but that wasn't the issue. The delivery and flow all felt a <b>little</b> <b>off.</b> We can see how Emma is slowly succumbing to becoming the Dark One and it's great to see Merlin is already free, but the scenes between Henry and Violet were a distraction and a spell being cured with love is something we've seen before." [...] Ratcliffe gave the episode a 6.5 rating out of 10.|$|E
2500|$|The {{band was}} formed in 2008 by Matthew Tybor, also {{referred}} to as [...] "The Bunny" [...] hence the rabbit mask and persona he incorporates in the group. Tybor was quickly joined by Chris Hutka, known as [...] "The Bear" [...] who likewise, wears a bear mask. In an interview, when asked about the meaning behind the band name and the masks, Tybor stated that [...] "I'm a little weird and a <b>little</b> <b>off,</b> but it was nothing in-depth or a serious meaning behind it. It was more of a random, incoherent thought and I ran with it". The Bunny (Tybor) employs screamed vocals for the band while The Bear provides clean vocals. The band's first five albums featured Chris Hutka as The Bear. Their sixth album A Liar Wrote This features Hutka's then-replacement, Haley Roback, and their seventh album The Way We Rust features Joseph Garcia, who had toured with the band in the past.|$|E
