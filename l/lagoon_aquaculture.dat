50|$|The largest portion is the Kentriki Limnothalassa ("central lagoon") {{a shallow}} sea {{separated}} from the Gulf of Patras and the Ionian Sea by a chain of sand islands and is characterized as open type lagoon. To the north, the Aitoliko lagoon {{is connected to the}} central lagoon by a narrow “neck” and resembles a deep lake (depth 28 m) rather than a lagoon. The Anatoliki Klisova, Dytiki Klisova, as well as the western lagoons of the complex, namely Tholi and Palaiopotamos, are some shallow areas characterized as closed type lagoons. These communicate with the sea along channels and receives fresh water from the drainage pump system of the region. These lagoons resembles the typical lagoons of north Italy where ‘’vallicultura’’ (<b>lagoon</b> <b>aquaculture)</b> is practiced. The bottom of the western and northwestern area of this system is muddy in contrast to the southern and south-eastern part, which is formed by sand and mud and is almost totally covered by Cymodocea nodosa. The six distinct lagoons can be defined by their topographic and hydrological characteristics.|$|E

It is now a small community with an archeological site, of which only the area called the [...] "Plaza de Armas" [...] has been excavated. Like Tzintzuntzan, this site also contains yácatas. The small {{community of}} Santa Cruz in the municipality of Tzintzuntzan is noted for its embroidery, especially on tablecloths. Figures such as animals, humans, and saints, as well as entire landscapes, can be found in embroidery here. An experimental artificial wetland has been constructed in the community of Cucuchucho on the shores of Lake Pátzcuaro. The wetlands system contains various water treatment processes such as solid removal and storage tanks, solids wetland, clarifier wetland, maturation <b>lagoon,</b> <b>aquaculture</b> lagoon and others. The wetland project is designed to treat wastewater before it returns to Lake Pátzcuaro and processes the discharge of a population of 700 people.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, {{aquaculture}} {{has become the}} most important livelihood activity in Tam Giang <b>Lagoon,</b> Vietnam. The <b>aquaculture</b> boom has reduced the available water area for mobile gear fishers, polarized different user-groups, created resource conflicts, and increased pressures on the <b>lagoon</b> systems. <b>Aquaculture</b> in the <b>lagoon</b> is governed by both customary and legal rights. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the diversity of resource use and the complexity of property rights in one of the villages located in the lagoon. The paper emphasizes the linkages between changes in commons institutions and changes in resource use and property rights. First, the political and socio-economic changes in Vietnam are examined as well as how they have influenced traditional commons institutions and lagoon resource management in the village. Second, the linkages between common institutions and the diversity of property rights are analyzed. Particular attention is given to the analysis of different types of resource use associated with "bundle of rights" and the diversity of property rights regimes in the village. </p...|$|R
40|$|Coastal {{aquaculture}} {{involves the}} cultivation of marine and brackish water species in ponds, protected Bays, Gulfs and <b>Lagoons.</b> <b>Aquaculture</b> became an important commercial food production since 1960 s (Chua, 1986; 1994) and lateer in 1970 s the aquaculture transformed rapidly with the success in breeding work of fish, shellfish, seaweed, artificial feed and genetic improvements. In particular Shrimp farming spread far and wide within three decades and became the prime export earning industry {{in many parts of}} the World (Liao, 1990). In the last two decades, many intensive aquaculture enterprises have suffered severe losses due to disease outbreaks (ADB and NACA, 1991) due to poor farm management. The quality of aquatic environment began to show a sign of unsustainability in many countries. U 1 billion dollar has been lost due to shrimp disease in Asia (FAO and NACA, 1995). It was reported in many countries like Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines, China and India. The environmental impact of aquaculture is becoming a matter of concern in the present scenario due to increase in industrialization, intensified aquaculture development, urbanization, population increase, pollution of coastal water due to sewage-industrial and agricultural waste. Intensification of culture practices has led to environmental deterioration both within the system and in the surrounding areas. The code of conduct for Responsible Fisheries evolved by the Food and Agricultural Organization, Rome in 1995 (FAO, 1995) is adapted by 168 countries including India. India is a signatory to implement many aspects besides the major issues related to aquaculture i. e. assessment for the discharge of effluents, use of drug and chemicals during aquaculture activities. Sustainability has become the major challenge to aquaculture development...|$|R

This species was recorded {{for the first time}} in the Po Delta lagoons in May and October 2008, probably introduced by the importation of the Manila clam Tapes philippinarum. At present, G. vermiculophylla is spread only near some clam-farming areas, but its diffusion is expected to increase with the colonization of other <b>lagoons</b> where <b>aquaculture</b> is spread, as already observed for other alien species such as Agardhiella subulata and Solieria filiformis.

50|$|The gallinule inhabits mainly {{freshwater}} lowland wetlands, usually below 125 m elevation, such as streams, springs or seeps, natural ponds, marshes, wet meadows, lotus and taro fields, reservoirs, sediment basins, sewage ponds, {{and drainage}} ditches.

To a lesser extent it will visit brackish or marine wetlands such as <b>lagoons</b> and shrimp <b>aquaculture</b> ponds. Although the birds are non-migratory, banding studies show that some dispersal occurs in spring between wetlands (and possibly between islands), in response to changes in water levels.|$|R
40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the dynamics}} of the potentially toxic and harmful species of Prorocentrum Ehrenberg in Bizerte <b>lagoon</b> (important <b>aquaculture</b> area, Northern Tunisia), substantiating the possible driving forces (temperature, salinity and nutrients), based on a two years database. We revealed that Prorocentrum spp. blooms of high magnitude (104 - 105 cells l- 1) occurred mostly during the period of late winter to early spring. We found five species of Prorocentrum, two of which, P. lima and P. cordatum, the most common during the field, are confirmed agents of Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning in various regions of the world ocean. Prorocentrum sp., P. micans, and P. gracile were however present only sporadically but with high cell abundances, exemplifying bloom densities. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that P. minimum and P. lima were much more abundant in eutrophied waters characterized here by high Chl a biomass, while P. gracile species occurred principally in warm waters. Furthermore, Prorocentrum sp. and P. micans seemed more likely to proliferate in saline waters with high concentrations of inorganic nutrients (nitrate, ammonia and phosphate). Our study calls attention to a possible intensification of DSP events in the Bizerte lagoon, given the propensity of Prorocentrum spp. to proliferate in a eutrophied system...|$|R
40|$|The black-lip {{pearl oyster}} (Pinctada margaritifera) is cultured {{extensively}} to produce black pearls, especially in French Polynesia atoll <b>lagoons.</b> This <b>aquaculture</b> relies on spat collection, {{a process that}} experiences spatial and temporal variability {{and needs to be}} optimized by understanding which factors influence recruitment. Here, we investigate the sensitivity of P. margaritifera larval dispersal to both physical and biological factors in the lagoon of Ahe atoll. Coupling a validated 3 D larval dispersal model, a bioenergetics larval growth model following the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory, and a population dynamics model, the variability of lagoon-scale connectivity patterns and recruitment potential is investigated. The relative contribution of reared and wild broodstock to the lagoon-scale recruitment potential is also investigated. Sensitivity analyses pointed out the major effect of the broodstock population structure as well as the sensitivity to larval mortality rate and inter-individual growth variability to larval supply and to the subsequent settlement potential. The application of the growth model clarifies how trophic conditions determine the larval supply and connectivity patterns. These results provide new cues to understand the dynamics of bottom-dwelling populations in atoll lagoons, their recruitment, and discuss how to take advantage of these findings and numerical models for pearl oyster management...|$|R

The mussel ropes were also large oxygen sinks and ammonium sources, with oxygen consumption and ammonium production rates of 1. 4 to 1. 5 and 0. 18 to 0. 43 mmol kg– 1 h– 1.

The black-lip pearl oyster (Pinctada margaritifera) is cultured extensively to produce black pearls, especially in French Polynesia’s atoll <b>lagoons.</b> This <b>aquaculture</b> relies on spat collection, a process that can be optimized by understanding which factors influence larval dispersal. Here, we investigate the sensitivity of P. margaritifera larval dispersal kernel to both physical and biological factors in the lagoon of Ahe atoll. Specifically, using a validated 3 D larval dispersal model, the variability of lagoon-scale connectivity is investigated against wind forcing, depth and location of larval release, destination location, vertical swimming behavior and pelagic larval duration (PLD) factors. The potential connectivity was spatially weighted according to both the natural and cultivated broodstock densities to provide a realistic view of connectivity. We found that the mean pattern of potential connectivity was driven by the southwest and northeast main barotropic circulation structures, with high retention levels in both. Destination locations, spawning sites and PLD were the main drivers of potential connectivity, explaining respectively 26 %, 59 % and 5 % of the variance. Differences between potential and realistic connectivity showed the significant contribution of the pearl oyster broodstock location to its own dynamics. Realistic connectivity showed larger larval supply in the western destination locations, which are preferentially used by farmers for spat collection. In addition, larval supply in the same sectors was enhanced during summer win...|$|R
40|$|A meta-analytical {{approach}} was followed {{to collect and}} review data on the biological and ecological characteristics of Amyloodinium ocellatum (AO) from the available literature (N= 116 publications). Disaggregated data have implemented an Excel spreadsheet to be rapidly extracted and evaluated. Milestones. AO is the only protozoan belonging to the Amyloodinium genus (class Dinophyceae) and the aetiological agent of amyloodiniosis. This protozoan is distributed worldwide in tropical and temperate regions and found in various aquatic habitats (sea and brackish water). AO is an obligate parasite dependent on euryhaline animals to survive and complete its triphasic life cycle. The AO triphasic cycle consists of a stationary parasitic stage (trophozoite/trophont), a free-living reproductive phase (tomont) and a free-swimming infective stage (dinospore). Additionally, the protozoan is not species-specific and can infect elasmobranchs, teleosts, crustaceans, mollusca and flatworms. AO can be diagnosed by light microscopy and rapid molecular diagnostic tools. Amyloodiniosis is a major threat for semi-intensive <b>aquaculture</b> (<b>lagoon</b> and land-based farming) in the Mediterranean basin especially in warmer months with high mortality rates (up to 100...|$|R
40|$|A {{framework}} {{was developed}} for determining carrying capacity through mass-balance ecosystem modeling and stakeholder involvement {{that can be used}} to guide management of bivalve aquaculture. A collaborative working group was formed where stakeholders worked closely with scientists to calculate carrying capacity which was then used to inform a long-term aquaculture plan for Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island 2 ̆ 7 s coastal <b>lagoons</b> where <b>aquaculture</b> has doubled in six years and user conflicts are high. Stakeholders informed the modeling process at four critical steps: conceptualization of models, evaluation of data sources for parameterization, mass-balancing of the model, and calculation of carrying capacity. Cultured oysters, at current and carrying capacity biomass levels calculated in the models, have insignificant impact on the ecosystems of Narragansett Bay and the lagoons, despite rapid increase in the industry. Cultured oyster biomass in Narragansett Bay is currently 0. 5 t km- 2 y- 1 and could be increased 625 times without exceeding the ecological carrying capacity, a density of aquaculture development above which causes unacceptable ecological impacts (297 t km - 2 y- 1). Production carrying capacity, the density at which harvests are maximized irrespective of ecosystem condition, was calculated to be 3, 481 t km- 2 y- 1. Cultured oyster biomass in the lagoons is currently 12 t km- 2 y- 1 and could increase 62 times this value without exceeding the ecological carrying capacity (722 t km- 2 y- 1). Production carrying capacity was calculated to be 1, 561 t km- 2 y- 1. Together, Narragansett Bay and the lagoons are capable of producing a total biomass of 119, 436 t of cultured oysters in a total area of 374 km 2 at ecological carrying capacity which is comparable to peak historic (1911) levels.

40|$|A {{workshop}} {{organized in}} French Polynesia in November 2004 allowed reviewing the current methods {{to model the}} three-dimensional hydrodynamic circulation in semi-enclosed atoll <b>lagoons</b> for <b>aquaculture</b> applications. Mollusk (e. g. pearl oyster, clam) aquaculture is {{a major source of}} income for South Pacific countries such as French Polynesia or Cook Islands. This aquaculture now requires a better understanding of circulation patterns to improve the spatial use of the lagoons, especially to define the best area to set larvae collectors. The pelagic larval duration of the relevant species (< 20 days) {{and the size of the}} semi-closed lagoons (few hundreds of km 2) drive the specifications of the model in terms of the spatial and temporal scale. It is considered that, in contrast with fish, mollusk larvae movements are limited and that their cycle occurs completely in the lagoon, without an oceanic stage. Atolls where aquaculture is productive are generally well-bounded, or semi-closed, without significant large and deep openings to the ocean. Nevertheless part of the lagoon circulation is driven by oceanic water inputs through the rim, ocean swells, tides and winds. Therefore, boundary conditions of the lagoon system are defined by the spatial structure of a very shallow rim (exposition and number of hoas), the deep ocean swell climate, tides and wind regimes. To obtain a realistic 3 D numerical model of lagoon circulation with adequate forcing, it is thus necessary to connect in an interdisciplinary way a variety of methods (models, remote sensing and in situ data collection) to accurately represent the different components of the lagoon system and its specific boundary conditions. We review here the current methods and tools used to address these different components for a hypothetical atoll of the Tuamotu Archipelago (French Polynesia), representative of the semi-closed lagoons of the South Pacific Ocean. We hope this paper will serve as a guide for similar studies elsewhere and we provide guidelines in terms of costs for all the different stages involved. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{priorities}} of the European Union political agenda concerns the tracking, management and control of fisheries resources. As most coastal zones, Venice Lagoon {{is subject to the}} deposit of sedimentological materials, in form of inorganic and organic detritus, nutrients and heavy metals, and there is also a very strong anthropic pressure; therefore, analysis and monitoring of production sites have a great importance in fisheries management and control. Aim of the present study is to identify and validate biochemical, physiological and molecular markers that could be utilized for assessing the state of health of productive sites, as well as to identify new ones. A multidisciplinary approach has been developed to define and characterize both the populations of bivalve mollusc growing up in some <b>aquaculture</b> <b>lagoon</b> sites and the best sites as well. Model organisms for the research are Tapes philippinarum and Tapes decussatus, two species of bivalve mollusc of the Veneridae family, which happens to have a great socio-economical importance: as a consequence, fishing and production sites have to be carefully controlled. The main focus of this study centers on inorganic pollution, specifically heavy metals bioaccumulation and storing in different tissues; the evaluation of metallothioneins induction has proved very helpful in determining the quality of old and new aquaculture sites; in addition, molecular markers have been used to look for a mollusc bivalve sub-population identification...|$|R
40|$|Heavy metal amount {{typically}} is {{much bigger}} in coastal and lagoon sediment than into overlying water. Sediment {{can be considered}} as a temporary sink for pollutants; in fact, remobilisation processes are able to bring to diffusion of contaminants into water body trough bioturbation, concentration gradient or resuspension caused by flooding, tide or boat traffic, all process that could easily change their geochemical parameters (e. g. redox potential) and make them more bioavailable. A complex net of this kind of events is notable in the Venice Lagoon (Italy), where two heavy metal-source point (Porto Marghera industrial area and the Murano island, renowned for artistic glass production), a water basin with an intense inland navigation (due both to local traffic and to shipping through the three harbour mouths, connecting the Lagoon with sea) and fishing activities are really active.

Oocyte maturation and ovulation were induced with {{human chorionic gonadotropin}} (HCG) in the African catfish, Heferobranchus longifilk. Females with a mean oocyte diameter of at least 1. 1 mm were used. 100 % ovulation was obtained after a single intra-muscular HCG injection of between 1. 0 and 2. 5 I.

Eggs could be stripped within 1 4 h of a dose of 1. 5 I. U. /g of HCG, a t a temperature of 27 to 29 " C.

Consequently, the overall impacts of mussel farming on oxygen and nutrient dynamics were much greater than those of clam farming. There were also differences in nitrate-reduction processes and the nitrate sources that fuelled them. In winter, at high water column nitrate concentrations, highest nitrate reduction rates (~ 320 孯l m- 2 h- 1) occurred at the mussel farm. Nitrate reduction was driven predominantly by water column nitrate and ~ 30 % of nitrate reduced was recycled to ammonium via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). At the control and clam farm sites, nitrate reduction rates were lower (~ 180 孯l m- 2 h- 1), nitrification supplied ~ 30 % of nitrate and denitrification was dominant. In summer under low nitrate conditions, nitrate reduction was highest (~ 130 孯l m- 2 h- 1) at the mussel farm site, but this activity was completely dependent upon water column nitrate and 95 % of nitrate was reduced via DNRA. In contrast, at the clam farm station, DNRA was unimportant and nitrification was the major nitrate source for denitrification. Consequently, whilst nitrate reduction processes eliminated fixed N from the clam farm sediments via coupled nitrification-denitrification, the dominance of DNRA at the mussel farm site resulted in a net N input to the sediment compartment. These large differences in the impacts of clam and mussel farming {{can be explained by}} the fact that infaunal clams stimulate transfer of both organic matter and oxygen to the sediment, whereas suspended mussels enhance only organic matter inputs.

40|$|Carps of {{the family}} Cyprinidae, the largest family of {{freshwater}} fishes in the world (Nelson 1994), have long been introduced beyond their native ranges, a practice that continues today. Although carps have been introduced for several centuries, the widespread introduction of the genus Hypophthalmichthys, the bigheaded carps, is a relatively recent phenomenon. All three recognized species of Hypophthalmichthys—H. nobilis, in North America referred to as Bighead Carp; H. molitrix; Silver Carp; and H. harmandi, Largescale Silver Carp—are native to fresh waters of eastern Asia. Largescale Silver Carp have been introduced elsewhere in west-central Asia as a hybrid with Silver Carp but are not {{known to have been}} brought to North America. Both Bighead and Silver carps have been introduced to many countries, including the United States, for uses in aquaculture production of food fishes and biological control of plankton in aquaculture ponds, reservoirs, and sewage treatment lagoons. Bighead and Silver carps were first imported into the United States in the early 1970 s. Soon after, both species were being used in research projects and were stocked into wastewater treatment <b>lagoons</b> and <b>aquaculture</b> ponds in several states without regard to their potential effects on the ecosystems to which they were introduced or on the species inhabiting them. Bighead and Silver carps escaped confinement during flood events and are now well established with reproducing populations in much of the Mississippi River Basin. The introduced range of both carps in the United States continues to grow. Based on the climate where these fishes are native, Bighead and Silver carps might eventually be found in many of the flowing waters of the United States. The escape of Bighead and Silver carps during evaluation as phytoplankton biological control organisms in commercial aquaculture ponds and sewage treatment facilities has left a legacy that could affect native fish populations within the Mississippi River Basin for decades to come. Populations of these carps in parts of the Mississippi River Basin appear to be increasing exponentially. If food resources become limiting, Bighead and Silver carps may compete with native planktivorous fishes, like Gizzard Shad, Dorosoma cepedianum, Bigmouth Buffalo, Ictiobus cyprinellus, and Paddlefish, Polyodon spathula. In addition to continuing to spread farther in the Mississippi River Basin by natural spread, the spread of Bighead and Silver carps could be aided by transportation of fishes caught for live bait, by livehaulers, the live seafood industry, and by those practicing prayer animal releases (practiced as a form of prayer by those whom believe that merits can be accrued by freeing captive animals into the wild). Although Silver Carp are not known to be cultured for marketing purposes in the United States now, Bighead Carp continue to be cultured in some states. Markets exist for live Bighead Carp in ethnic markets in the United States and southern Canada requiring transport in live haul trucks. Silver Carp have not been as prominent in the live food fish trade as Bighead Carp because they are not available from aquaculture and because they are more fragile to handle and transport alive. However, wild-caught Silver and Bighead carps are occasionally encountered in live markets. The purpose of this document is to present a summary of the biology and distribution of the three species of Hypophthalmichthys. For each species, information is included as follows: (1) taxonomy and distinguishing characteristics; (2) native range; (3) habitat preferences; (4) migrations and local movements; (5) biology and natural history (including temperature and salinity tolerances, reproductive biology, feeding habits, growth rate and longevity, and response to physical stimuli); (6) diseases and parasites; (7) human uses of Hypophthalmichthys (including harvest from reservoirs and other water bodies, culture, control of algae, removal of excess nutrients, and production and growth of other fishes); (8) history of introductions around the world and the United States; (9) potential range in the United States; (10) population and distribution control measures; and (11) state regulations. Although most of the information in this document is supported by citations from peer-reviewed scientific literature, we have relied on personal observations and personal communications for some information, particularly the biology of Bighead and Silver carps in the United States. A variety of biological research is in progress on these fishes in the Mississippi River Basin, but much of the information from this research has not yet been vetted through peer-reviewed journals. We have minimized reliance on unpublished information to the greatest extent possible. Also included is an evaluation of the organism risk potential of each species of Hypophthalmichthys in the United States using the Generic Nonindigenous Aquatic Organisms Risk Analysis Review Process. This risk assessment process uses both the probability of establishment and the consequences of establishment to determine the overall organism risk potential in the United States. This document is limited to the ecological effects and consequences of Hypophthalmichthys in the wild. The economic benefits of the continued culture and marketing of Hypophthalmichthys are {{beyond the scope of this}} document and are being evaluated by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Department of Fisheries and Oceans is also conducting a risk assessment on Asian carps of the genera Ctenopharyngodon, Hypophthalmichthys, and Mylopharyngodon in Canada. Although we provide some discussion on the culture of these carps, we do not treat it in detail.
