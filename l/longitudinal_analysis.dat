40|$|Microsimulation is {{well known}} {{as a tool for}} static {{analysis}} of tax and transfer policies, for the generation of programmatic cost estimates, and dynamic analyses of socio-economic and demographic systems. However, microsimulation also has the potential to contribute to <b>longitudinal</b> data <b>analysis</b> in several ways, including extending the range of outputs generated by a model, addressing several defective-data problems, and serving as a vehicle for missing-data imputation. This paper discusses microsimulation procedures suitable for several commonly-used statistical models applied to longitudinal data.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} nonparametric quasi-likelihood approach to estimate regression coefficients {{in the class}} of generalized linear regression models for <b>longitudinal</b> data <b>analysis,</b> where the covariance matrices of the longitudinal data are totally unknown but are smooth functions of means. This proposed nonparametric quasi-likelihood approach is to replace the unknown covariance matrix with a nonparametric estimator in the quasi-likelihood estimating equations, which are used to estimate the regression coefficients for <b>longitudinal</b> data <b>analysis.</b> Local polynomial regression techniques are used to get the nonparametric estimator of the unknown covariance matrices in the proposed nonparametric quasi-likelihood approach. Rates of convergence of the resulting estimators are established. It is shown that the nonparametric quasi-likelihood estimator is not only consistent but also has the same asymptotic distribution as the quasi-likelihood estimator obtained with the true covariance matrix. The results from simulation studies show that the performance of the nonparametric quasi-likelihood estimator is comparable to other methods with given marginal variance functions and correctly specified correlation structures. Moreover, the results of the simulation studies show that nonparametric quasi-likelihood corrects some shortcomings of Liang and Zeger's GEE approach in <b>longitudinal</b> data <b>analysis...</b>|$|R

US citizenship and years spent in the United States were positively associated with geographic mobility into different neighborhoods while co-ethnic contact and prior experiences of ethnic discrimination decreased the likelihood that Latino immigrants would move from their original neighborhoods and into non-Hispanic White census tracts.|$|E
5000|$|A study {{published}} in the Journal of Sexuality Research and Social Policy concluded that parental television involvement was associated with greater body satisfaction among adolescent girls, less sexual experience amongst both male and female adolescents, and that parental television involvement may influence self-esteem and body image, in part by increasing parent-child closeness. However, a more recent article by Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard cautioned that the literature on media and body dissatisfaction is weaker and less consistent than often claimed and that media effects have been overemphasized.

50|$|A 2016 study {{commissioned}} by the Transportation Research Board conducted a comprehensive <b>longitudinal</b> <b>analysis</b> of census block groups in Chicago. Block groups were categorized in one of 3 categories: block groups with bike lanes installed, block groups with sharrows only, and block groups with no cycling infrastructure. The authors found that blocks with bike lanes experienced a significantly larger increase in bicycle commuters than block groups with sharrows, which were only a bit better than those without infrastructure. Block groups with only sharrows installed were significantly less effective at reducing injuries per year per commuter than both block groups with bike lanes and even as block groups with no infrastructure. The study concludes that these findings raise concerns {{on the effectiveness of}} sharrows as a safety measure and as an incentive to bicycle commuting.In the discussion on this study it was criticized that block groups were compared instead of streets.|$|E
