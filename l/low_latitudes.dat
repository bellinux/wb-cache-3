5|$|Argentina {{regularly}} receives {{cold air}} from the south that can reach <b>low</b> <b>latitudes</b> owing {{to the influence of}} the Andes. Cold waves are usually accompanied with severe snowstorms or extremely cold conditions that can have a devastating impact on the country's economy. These snowstorms and/or extremely cold conditions can partially or completely paralyze activities in large areas of Patagonia and the center of the country. In addition, cold conditions can lead to energy shortages during the winter months due to increased demand. The low temperatures brought by these cold waves can cause frosts that can damage plants, severely affecting agricultural production and devastating the local economy.|$|E
5|$|With {{global warming}} causing glaciers and {{permafrost}} to melt rapidly and allowing {{a large amount}} of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a disruption in the thermohaline circulation. Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be likely to have an effect on their migration. The whales summer in the cool, high latitudes, where they feed in krill-abundant waters; they winter in warmer, <b>low</b> <b>latitudes,</b> where they mate and give birth.|$|E
5|$|All winds on Venus are {{ultimately}} driven by convection. Hot air {{rises in the}} equatorial zone, where solar heating is concentrated, and flows to the poles. Such an almost-planetwide overturning of the troposphere is called Hadley circulation. However, the meridional air motions are much slower than zonal winds. The poleward limit of the planet wide Hadley cell on Venus is near ±60° latitudes. Here air starts to descend {{and returns to the}} equator below the clouds. This interpretation is supported by the distribution of the carbon monoxide, which is also concentrated in the vicinity of ±60° latitudes. Poleward of the Hadley cell a different pattern of circulation is observed. In the latitude range 60°–70° cold polar collars exist. They are characterised by temperatures about 30–40K lower than in the upper troposphere at nearby latitudes. The lower temperature is probably caused by the upwelling of the air in them and by the resulting adiabatic cooling. Such an interpretation is supported by the denser and higher clouds in the collars. The clouds lie at 70–72km altitude in the collars—about 5km higher than at the poles and <b>low</b> <b>latitudes.</b> A connection may exist between the cold collars and high speed midlatitude jets in which winds blow as fast as 140m/s. Such jets are a natural consequence of the Hadley–type circulation and should exist on Venus between 55–60° latitude.|$|E

25|$|Some {{models of}} the ocean {{circulation}} suggest that broad-scale upwelling occurs in the tropics, as pressure driven flows converge water toward the <b>low</b> <b>latitudes</b> where it is diffusively warmed from above.

The F-layer h ’F and foF 2 data, from Trivandrum an equatorial station and Delhi a <b>low</b> <b>latitude</b> location, are examined during the two great magnetospheric storm events that occurred in October 2003 and November 2003 with minimum Dst indexes- 347 and- 429 nT, respectively. While only Delhi data is analyzed for the recent storm of November 2004 having minimum Dst index- 383 nT. During this study, it is clearly observed {{that there is an}} enhancement in height of F-region, at both equator and <b>low</b> <b>latitude,</b> with collapsing of ionization at midnight during maximum negative excursion on Dst values, which is followed by an enhancement at <b>low</b> <b>latitude</b> during recovery phase of the storm.

25|$|At <b>low</b> <b>latitudes</b> the Hadley {{circulation}} dominates, and {{is essentially}} the same as the process which on Earth generates the trade winds. At higher latitudes a series of high and low pressure areas, called baroclinic pressure waves, dominate the weather. Mars is drier and colder than Earth, and in consequence dust raised by these winds tends to remain in the atmosphere longer than on Earth as there is no precipitation to wash it out (excepting CO2 snowfall). One such cyclonic storm was recently captured by the Hubble space telescope (pictured below).|$|E
25|$|The snowball Earth {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} invoked to explain glacial deposits in the Huronian Supergroup of Canada, though the palaeomagnetic evidence that suggests ice sheets at <b>low</b> <b>latitudes</b> is contested.

It has been proposed that rise of free oxygen {{that occurred during the}} Great Oxygenation Event removed methane in the atmosphere through oxidation. As the Sun was notably weaker at the time, Earth's climate may have relied on methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, to maintain surface temperatures above freezing.|$|E
25|$|In {{other parts}} of the world, a big effect will be low yields of grain {{according}} to the World Food Trade Model, specifically in the low latitude regions where much of the developing world is located. From this the price of grain will rise, along with the developing nations trying to grow the grain. Due to this, every 2–2.5% price hike will increase the number of hungry people by 1%. Low crop yields are just one of the problem facing farmers in the <b>low</b> <b>latitudes</b> and tropical regions. The timing and length of the growing seasons, when farmers plant their crops, are going to be changing dramatically, per the USDA, due to unknown changes in soil temperature and moisture conditions.|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{a sudden}} decline in sea level, {{intermittent}} periods of ocean-bottom hyperoxia and anoxia (high-oxygen and low- or zero-oxygen conditions) {{may have caused}} the 13C/12C ratio fluctuations in the Early Triassic; and global anoxia may {{have been responsible for}} the end-Permian blip. The continents of the end-Permian and early Triassic were more clustered in the tropics than they are now, and large tropical rivers would have dumped sediment into smaller, partially enclosed ocean basins at <b>low</b> <b>latitudes.</b> Such conditions favor oxic and anoxic episodes; oxic/anoxic conditions would result in a rapid release/burial, respectively, of large amounts of organic carbon, which has a low 13C/12C ratio because biochemical processes use the lighter isotopes more.

500|$|Following {{multiple}} {{outbreaks of}} tropical cyclone activity across the Western Pacific basin in September1987, a large ridge developed at unusually <b>low</b> <b>latitudes</b> of the basin, forcing the Intertropical Convergence Zone further south and making environmental conditions unfavorable for tropical cyclone formation. On October6, the monsoon trough began to re-establish itself around the 5th parallel north as the ridge receded northward. The next day, satellite imagery {{indicated that a}} low-pressure area embedded in the monsoon trough developed [...] south of Yap. Although shower activity was initially displaced {{to the north of}} the low, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system, on the basis of increased circus outflow. Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression. Within 24 hours of the issuance of the TCFA, thunderstorm activity gradually increased in coverage, and the JTWC upgraded the disturbance into a tropical depression at 00:00UTC on October10, although post-season analysis from the JTWC indicated that this occurred six hours earlier than operationally estimated. Despite a [...] displacement between the surface and upper-level circulations, the JTWC upgraded the depression into a tropical storm at 12:00UTC. Six hours later, the JMA followed suit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It {{is known}} that interplanetary plasma has {{significant}} influence on the storm time magnetic field variations observed {{on the surface of}} the earth. It has been well observed that the southward component of interplanetary magnetic field is a strong candidate in triggering and controlling the geomagnetic storm. However, apart from this, the solar wind parameters such as plasma density, velocity etc. could also have considerable contribution to the ground magnetic field variations and the present study aims to identify this association. Thus, to investigate the influence of solar wind parameters on the magnetic field variations at <b>low</b> <b>latitude,</b> we use one-minute observations of the horizontal component of the magnetic field variations at Alibag (Geomagnetic latitude = 9 o N), and onboard ACE satellite measurements of plasma parameters during intense storm events. During the development and decay stage of geomagnetic storms, close correspondence of rapid changes observed at the <b>low</b> <b>latitude</b> magnetic field with solar wind parameters leads to further extended investigation using filter analysis techniques, which reveals that the bursts of solar wind density have clear marks at <b>low</b> <b>latitude</b> magnetic field measurements. Cross correlation analysis shows that the solar wind dynamic pressure has significant correlation with surface magnetic observations, which provides direct evidence of solar wind impact at <b>low</b> <b>latitude</b> magnetic field variations...|$|R
