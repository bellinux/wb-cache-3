With {{this type of}} instrument, soil collars that can {{be connected to the}} survey measuring instrument are inserted into the ground and the soil is allowed to stabilize for a period of time. The insertion of the soil collar temporarily disturbs the soil, creating measuring artifacts. For this reason, it is common to have several soil collar inserted at different locations.

The {{particles}} of an insulating dielectric whilst under induction may {{be compared to}} a series of small magnetic needles, or more correctly still {{to a series of}} small insulated conductors. If the space round a charged globe were filled with a mixture of an insulating dielectric, as oil of turpentine or air, and small globular conductors, as shot, the latter being at a little distance from each other so as to be insulated, then these would in their condition and action exactly resemble what I consider to be the condition and action of the {{particles of}} the insulating dielectric itself (1337.). If the globe were charged, these little conductors would all be polar; if the globe were discharged, they would all return to their normal state, to be polarized again upon the recharging of the globe. The state developed by induction through such particles on a mass of conducting mutter at a distance would be of the contrary kind, and exactly equal in amount to the force in the inductric globe. There would be a <b>lateral</b> <b>diffusion</b> of force (1224. 1297.), because each polarized sphere would be in an active or tense relation to all those contiguous to it, just as one magnet can affect two or more magnetic needles near it, and these again a still greater number beyond them. Hence would result the production of curved lines of inductive force if the inducteous body in such a mixed dielectric were an uninsulated metallic ball (1219. &c.) or other properly shaped mass. Such curved lines are the consequences of the two electric forces arranged as I have assumed them to be: and, that the inductive force can be directed in such curved lines is the strongest proof of the presence of the two powers and the polar condition of the dielectric particles.|$|E

40|$|An SECM {{method for}} {{measuring}} <b>lateral</b> proton <b>diffusion</b> at Langmuir monolayers deposited at a water/air (W/A) interface is described. The approach utilises the electrogeneration of a base by {{the reduction of}} weak acid (producing hydrogen) at an inverted submarine ultramicroelectrode (UME) placed close to the monolayer in the aqueous subphase of a Langmuir trough. The electrogenerated base diffuses to the monolayer and titrates away protons, resulting in conversion of the base back to its initial form. The acidic monolayer is thus depronated locally which creates a concentration gradient for <b>lateral</b> proton <b>diffusion.</b> A numerical model is developed for the SECM mass transport problem {{and the effect of}} <b>lateral</b> proton <b>diffusion</b> on the UME current response is established. The method is demonstrated experimentally with measurements of <b>lateral</b> proton <b>diffusion</b> along a stearic acid monolayer at a wide range of surface pressures. The <b>lateral</b> proton <b>diffusion</b> coefficient is found to be fairly uniform (similar to 8 x 10 (- 6) cm(2) s(- 1)) when the surface pressure of the monolayer (pi) is in the range of 1 - 20 mN m(- 1), but decreases to immeasurably low values when pi is greater than 25 mN m(- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|A new {{scanning}} electrochemical microscopy proton feedback {{method has}} been developed for investigating <b>lateral</b> proton <b>diffusion</b> at phospholipid assemblies: specifically Langmuir monolayers at the water/air interface. In this approach, a base is electrogenerated by the reduction of a weak acid (producing hydrogen) at a "submarine" ultramicroelectrode (UME) placed in the aqueous subphase of a Langmuir trough close to a monolayer. The electrogenerated base diffuses to and titrates monolayer-bound protons and is converted back to its initial form, so enhancing the current response at the UME. Local deprotonation of the monolayer creates a concentration gradient for <b>lateral</b> proton <b>diffusion.</b> A numerical model {{has been developed}}, {{taking into account the}} potential-dependent association/dissociation constant of the interfacial acid groups. A comparison is made of monolayers comprising either acidic DL-alpha-phosphatidyl-L-serine, dipalmitoyl (DPPS) or zwitterionic L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoyl (DPPC) monolayers at a range of surface pressures. It is demonstrated that lateral proton fluxes at DPPS are significant, but the <b>lateral</b> proton <b>diffusion</b> coefficient is lower than in bulk solution.

Diffusion of the desensitized receptor for the exchange of a naive functional one increases synaptic fidelity during fast repetitive stimulation. PNNs compartmentalize the neuronal surface and act as <b>lateral</b> <b>diffusion</b> barriers for AMPARs, limiting synaptic exchange.

The Integrated Optoelectronic Repeater: The design, fabrication, {{and testing of}} the first monolithic integrated optical repeater is described. This device consists of an optical detector, electronic gain stage, and current modulated semiconductor laser transmitter integrated in a single crystal chip to perform the function of regenerating an optical signal as might be found in an optical communication system. The device has a measured optical gain (light out to light in) of 10 dB. 2. Ion Implanted Lasers and Schottky Gate Field Effect Transistors: The use of ion implantation as a technique to fabricate both lasers and field effect transistors is described. Devices fabricated include a beryllium implanted laser diode on N type GaAs substrate, a beryllium implanted laser diode on semi-insulating Cr doped GaAs substrate integrated with a field effect transistor driver, and sulfur implanted GaAs field effect transistors. 3. A Steady State Lateral Model of the Double Heterostructure Laser: A theoretical model of the double heterostructure laser is described which treats the p-n junction in the device correctly by using fundamental semiconductor relationships and reasonable assumptions about the device heterointerfaces. The model treats both the electronic and optical properties self consistently, making the model valid above lasing threshold. Finite element formalism is adopted as a solution technique to enable the treatment of complicated diode geometries. An example is treated and theoretical and experimental results are compared. 4. The Effect of <b>Lateral</b> Carrier <b>Diffusion</b> on the Modulation Response of a Semiconductor Laser: The effect of <b>lateral</b> carrier <b>diffusion</b> upon the modulation characteristics of the semiconductor laser is investigated. A self consistent analysis of the spatially dependent rate equations is performed using a finite element model.

The scalar wave equation is posed in a variational form, and the effective permittivity formalism is treated as a variational approximation technique.

Furthermore, protein-cytoskeleton associations mediate the formation of ‚Äúcytoskeletal fences‚Äù, corrals wherein lipid and membrane proteins can diffuse freely, but that they can seldom leave.

Moreover, they impose physical constraints that restrict the free <b>lateral</b> <b>diffusion</b> of proteins and at least some lipids within the bilipid layer. When integral proteins of the lipid bilayer are tethered to the extracellular matrix, they are unable to diffuse freely.
