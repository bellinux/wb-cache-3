A conditional difference-in-differences technique is employed for an estimation of the impact and block bootstrapping is used for computing consistent standard errors. The results indicate a positive and statistically as well as economically significant effect of a <b>large</b> <b>investment</b> <b>project</b> on the local unemployment outflow rate, which is driven mainly by increases in the aggregate unemployment exit hazard rates for unemployment durations smaller than nine months. Subsequent to the investment, the unemployment rate decreased by 1. 7 Â percentage points and the employment rate increased by 3. 7 Â percentage points in the host district. However, the impact on long-term unemployed was negligible as the exit hazard rates for durations longer than nine months remain unchanged.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to search for a {{mechanism}} for implementing large investment projects of crucial economic importance in the modern economic conditions characterized by the sanction policy of foreign states, limited public investment, and a mass exodus of foreign investors. An example of a large-scale investment project is the construction of a multipurpose multimodal complex — the commercial seaport of Ust-Luga. This is one of the most recent large projects in seaport infrastructure development. This article estimates the project’s significance for the development of the Baltic region and presents a competitive analysis of the seaport position in comparison to the largest European ports. The authors analyze the strengths of the seaport construction project, namely, the favorable natural environment and climate, advantageous geographical position, strong political will demonstrated by the federal and regional authorities. The article also considers the challenges the project faces — unfortunate geopolitical situation, growing competition from other seaports, and lack of investment. Based on the analysis of challenges, it is concluded that there are significant risks associated predominantly with lack of investment. In these conditions, a <b>large</b> <b>investment</b> <b>project</b> requires the enhancement of public-private partnership, which will ensure the timely implementation of such projects...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore, if like some other management initiatives, New Public Management may be a repackaging of already existent concepts. Emerging in the 1970 s and 1980 s as an innovative way to manage public sector elements, New Public Management has affected both the ownership and management of public sector companies, services, and utilities. Minimal research has been undertaken previously, using historic archival sources of public entities, to explore if elements of the concept originated prior to the 1970 s. Design/methodology/approach This research draws on archival records from a publicly-owned electricity company, covering about three decades from 1946, during which a <b>large</b> <b>investment</b> <b>project</b> was undertaken by the company. We draw on key tenets of what is today called New Public Management, examining prior research to ascertain if similar elements were present in the case organisation. Findings When reviewing the progress of the investment project, many of the key elements of New Public Management emerged, even during the early part of the project. Originality/value There is little historical research on the origins of New Public Management, and the findings here suggest it may not be entirely new. While this does not at all invalidate existing research, it suggests New Public Management may be to an extent a repackaging of previously extant techniques. This opens up possibilities for future historic research in terms of how and why it was repackaged, and also what was/was not repackaged...|$|E

40|$|People {{invest in}} {{projects}} {{to make a}} profit. If the cost of investment {{is larger than the}} revenue, a rational person would not invest. Though these two statements may seem trivial, the reality is that {{it is often difficult to}} know what the expected costs and payoffs are. Like with any prediction in the future, there is always a level of uncertainty. The amount of available literature which qualitively deals with risk, greatly outnumbers the available literature on quantitative risk. Through mathematic modelling, we can attempt to quantify this uncertainty and bring it to a minimum. In addition, this allows us to find an optimal investment strategy (Should we invest now? And if so, how much? Or should we invest later or drop the project altogether?). The relevance and importance of such a strategy is obvious to anyone considering investing into a project whether it is in researching a new medicine, planning construction for a new library or producing a new electronics device. Though each mentioned example deals with different types of project-specific problems, it will become apparent that the model we find has a wide range of application. This paper is divided into three parts. First there is a finance part which gives some background information and applies stochastic calculus to derive the main equation for investment opportunities.

40|$|Institutional {{investment}} {{in technology and}} infrastructure {{for the provision of}} new online and self-access language learning opportunities is not always accompanied by the necessary changes in the practices of learners, practitioners and managers in higher education (Wertsch, 2002). As a result, feelings of frustration, helplessness and confusion in individuals can begin to emerge soon after the initial excitement and novelty wear off. A <b>large</b> <b>investment</b> <b>project</b> that has little or no overall impact may give rise to questions about the adequate use of resources and ultimately lead to abandoning, discontinuing or replacing the project. What lies at the root of failures to implement CALL institutionally? How can new practices emerge from existing ones? To explore these questions, in this paper we describe a project {{based on the assumption that}} the proposed CALL triangle consisting of the student, the teacher and the institution should be seen as a triangle of triangles, that is, the combination of three separate triangles, each one representing the specific activity system of the student, the teacher and the institution. The rationale is that these activities have different objects and motives as well as their own inner contradictions manifested in various ways. Building upon activity theory (Leontiev, 1978; Vygotsky 1987; Engeström, 1987) and expansive learning theory (Engeström, 1987) principles, the authors advocate the Change Laboratory methodology developed at CRADLE (University of Helsinki’s Center for Research on Activity, Development and Learning) to bridge gaps between the three activities of the student, the teacher and the institution by finding a shared object, building a common zone of proximal development and creating the necessary tools that could lead to the formation of a new collective activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of infrastructure is a <b>large</b> <b>investment</b> <b>project</b> in society. It is therefore important {{to develop new}} design methods and tools that promote {{the understanding of the}} paradox of human encounters within an efficient transport environment. The prominent spatial dimension regarding the environment for public transport are not sufficiently investigated - to balance the urgent need for sustainable transport infrastructures with an appreciation {{of what it means to}} be a human in such an environment. 	 In The United Nations climate convention, the Kyoto protocol (2005) as well as the Copenhagen protocol (2009) is stated that the greenhouse gases must be reduced in order to prevent global warming. In order to achieve this goal, travelling by public transport supports an eco-effective transport solution. Municipalities, regions and the Swedish state organs collaborate together for the vision K 2020, to double the amount of journeys made by public transport. The architectonic challenge is to upgrade the status of space for public transport. The explorative, empirical research study TOOLBOX aims at developing a methodology for transdisciplinary communication, using one’s own body as a research tool in order to develop new design methods and tools that further the understanding of the paradox of human encounters, the need for intimate, sensorial space, within an efficient transport environment. Phenomenology offers a theoretical base for architectural design practice that considers human movement and sensory experiences (Hopsch & Cesario 2011) as well as ethical dimensions (McCann 2011), addressing issues of security, orientation, climate, and beauty in an environment that could cause alienation. This article outlines the theoretical ideas that the methodology is based on. The TOOLBOX methodology emphasizes how to design for relational space, pointing to social sustainability by designing with (spatial) care. The key concept is how one’s own bodily, sensory, experiences are being turned into a systematic, powerful design tool. Can thus a new phenomenological, architectural and bodily perspective bridge the ethical and spatial paradoxes of efficient public transport? Will we, by such a perspective, be able to implement new design methods and tools for urban planning processes that further the encounter between humans and the built environment with a deeper knowledge of spatial urban form in an embodied context...|$|E
