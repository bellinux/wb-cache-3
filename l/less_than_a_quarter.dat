Furthermore, by inhibiting spin transitions away from the laser intensity null, selective coherent rotation of individual spins is realized. This technique can be extended to subnanometre dimensions, thus enabling applications in diverse areas ranging from quantum information science to bioimaging. ...|$|R

40|$|Although tidally-locked {{habitable}} planets orbiting nearby M-dwarf {{stars are}} among the best astronomical targets to search for extrasolar life, they may also be deficient in volatiles and water. Climate models for this class of planets show atmospheric transport of water from the dayside to the nightside, where it is precipitated as snow and trapped as ice. Since ice only slowly flows back to the dayside upon accumulation, the resulting hydrological cycle can trap a large amount of water in the form of nightside ice. Using ice sheet dynamical and ther-modynamical constraints, I illustrate how planets with <b>less</b> <b>than</b> about <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> the Earth’s oceans could trap most of their surface water on the nightside. This would leave their dayside, where habitable conditions are met, potentially dry. The amount and distribution of residual liquid water on the dayside depend on a variety of geophysical factors, including the efficiency of rock weathering at reg-ulating atmospheric CO 2 as dayside ocean basins dry-up. Water-trapped worlds with dry daysides may offer similar advantages as land planets for habitability, by contrast with worlds where more abundant water freely flows around the globe. 1...|$|R
25|$|Coins {{may be in}} {{circulation}} with fiat values lower than {{the value of their}} component metals, but they are never initially issued with such value, and the shortfall only arises over time due to inflation, as market values for the metal overtake the fiat declared face value of the coin. Examples are the pre-1965 US dime, quarter, half dollar, and dollar (nominally containing slightly <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> tenth, <b>quarter,</b> half, and full ounce of silver, respectively), US nickel, and pre-1982 US penny. As a result of the increase in the value of copper, the United States greatly reduced the amount of copper in each penny. Since mid-1982, United States pennies are made of 97.5% zinc, with the remaining 2.5% being a coating of copper. Extreme differences between fiat values and metal values of coins cause coins to be hoarded or removed from circulation by illicit smelters in order to realise the value of their metal content. This is an example of Gresham's law. The United States Mint, in an attempt to avoid this, implemented new interim rules on December 14, 2006, subject to public comment for 30 days, which criminalized the melting and export of pennies and nickels. Violators can be fined up to $10,000 and/or imprisoned for up to five years.|$|R

40|$|Resonance {{characteristics}} of tidal waves {{in a network}} are investigated with the linearized, one-dimensional shallow water equations. The network comprises a semi-enclosed main channel with an adjacent secondary channel at an arbitrary position. Water motion is forced by a prescribed incoming wave {{at the entrance of}} the main channel. The model is used to compute the ratio of sea surface height amplitude in the presence and absence of the secondary channel. Relevance lies in the possible construction of secondary channels to reduce tidal range in the main channel. When μ= 2 πl∗b/l∗t≳π (l∗b being the length of the main channel, l∗t the tidal wavelength) and friction is weak, it is found that reduction (amplification) of the tidal range occurs for secondary channels located <b>less</b> (more) <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> wavelength from the closed end of the main channel. Furthermore, a minimum is observed halfway between the closed end and the nodal point, and <b>a</b> maximum <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> wavelength further seaward. With increasing friction and/or decreasing length of the main channel, amplitude ratios become less pronounced and depend weakly on the location of the secondary channel. The mechanism responsible for amplification or reduction of the sea surface height in the main channel is identified and explained in terms of the forced wave and waves radiating away from the secondary channel...|$|R
40|$|A {{magnetic}} dynamo {{driven by}} differential rotation generated when stars merge can explain strong fields in certain classes of magnetic stars, including the high field magnetic white dwarfs (HFMWDs). In their case {{the site of}} the differential rotation has been variously proposed to be within a common envelope, the massive hot outer regions of a merged degenerate core or an accretion disc formed by a tidally disrupted companion that is subsequently incorporated into a degenerate core. We synthesize a population of binary systems to investigate the stellar merging hypothesis for observed single HFMWDs. Our calculations provide mass distribution and the fractions of white dwarfs that merge during a common envelope phase or as double degenerate systems in a post common envelope phase. We vary the common envelope efficiency parameter alpha and compare with observations. We find that this hypothesis can explain both the observed incidence of magnetism and the mass distribution of HFMWDs {{for a wide range of}} alpha. In this model, the majority of the HFMWDs are of the Carbon Oxygen type and merge within <b>a</b> common envelope. <b>Less</b> <b>than</b> about <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of <b>a</b> per cent of HFMWDs originate from double degenerate stars that merge after common envelope evolution and these populate the high-mass tail of the HFMWD mass distribution.

40|$|The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) {{equation}} is tested experimentally {{as a model}} for moderate amplitude waves propagating in one direction in relatively shallow water of uniform depth. For a wide range of initial data, comparisons are made between the asymptotic wave forms observed and those predicted by the theory {{in terms of the number}} of solitons that evolve, the amplitude of the leading soliton, the asymptotic shape of the wave and other qualitative features. The KdV {{equation is}} found to predict accurately the number of evolving solitons and their shapes for initial data whose asymptotic characteristics develop in the test section of the wave tank. The accuracy of the leading-soliton amplitudes computed by the KdV equation could not be conclusively tested owing to the viscous decay of the measured wave amplitudes; however, a procedure is presented for estimating the decay in amplitude of the leading wave. Computations suggest that the KdV equation predicts the amplitude of the leading soliton to within the expected error due to viscosity (12 %) when the non-decayed amplitudes are <b>less</b> <b>than</b> about <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of the water depth.
