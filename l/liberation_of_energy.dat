The origin of this rapid variability has been extensively debated(5), but a correlation between optical and radio variations in some sources(6, 7) suggests that both are intrinsic.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{numerical}} simulation of the history and future development of the Pleiades. This study builds on our previous one that established statistically the present-day structure of this system. Our simulation begins just after molecular cloud gas has been expelled by the embedded stars. We then follow, using an N body code, the stellar dynamical evolution of the cluster to the present and beyond. Our initial state is that which evolves, over the 125 Myr age of the cluster, to a configuration most closely matching the current one. We find that the original cluster, newly stripped of gas, already had a virial radius of 4 pc. This configuration was larger than most observed, embedded clusters. Over time, the cluster expanded further and the central surface density fell by about a factor of two. We attribute both effects to the <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> from tightening binaries of short period. Indeed, the original binary fraction was close to unity. The ancient Pleiades also had significant mass segregation, which persists in the cluster today. In the future, the central density of the Pleiades will continue to fall. For the first few hundred Myr, the cluster as a whole will expand because of dynamical heating by binaries. The expansion process is aided by mass loss through stellar evolution, which weakens the system's gravitational binding. At later times, the Galactic tidal field begins to heavily deplete the cluster mass. It is believed that most open clusters are eventually destroyed by close passage of a giant molecular cloud. Barring that eventuality, the density falloff will continue for as long as 1 Gyr, by which time most of the cluster mass will have been tidally stripped away by the Galactic field.

40|$|Stress {{is defined}} as the {{behavioral}} and physiological responses generated in the face of, or in anticipation of, a perceived threat. The stress response involves activation of the sympathetic nervous system and recruitment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. When an organism encounters a stressor (social, physical, etc.), these endogenous stress systems are stimulated in order to generate a fight-or-flight response, and manage the stressful situation. As such, an organism is forced to liberate energy resources in attempt to meet the energetic demands posed by the stressor. A change in the energy homeostatic balance is thus required to exploit an appropriate resource and deliver useable energy to the target muscles and tissues involved in the stress response. Acutely, this change in energy homeostasis and the <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> is considered advantageous, as it is required for the survival of the organism. However, when an organism is subjected to a prolonged stressor, as is the case during chronic stress, a continuous irregularity in energy homeostasis is considered detrimental and may lead to the development of metabolic disturbances such as cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes mellitus and obesity. This concept has been studied extensively using animal models, and the neurobiological underpinnings of stress induced metabolic disorders are beginning to surface. However, different animal models of stress continue to produce divergent metabolic phenotypes wherein some animals become anorexic and loose body mass while others increase food intake and body mass and become vulnerable to the development of metabolic disturbances. It remains unclear exactly what factors associated with stress models can be used to predict the metabolic outcome of the organism. This review will explore a variety of rodent stress models and discuss the elements that influence the metabolic outcome in order to further our understanding of stress-induced obesity...|$|E

Thus, the hydrolysis of a nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) to nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) {{with the release of}} free orthophosphate results in a <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> In addition, proteins that work as switches or gates in order to ensure fidelity and directionality to many synthetic and signal transduction processes also use NTP hydrolysis. This thesis describes the studies of the mechanisms involved in controlling the GTP and ATP binding and hydrolysis by the Ffh and FtsY proteins from the bacterial Signal Recognition Particle, SRP, and the origin binding protein, OBP, or UL 9 from the Herpes simplex virus type 1 replication machinery. The Ffh and FtsY proteins from Mycoplasma mycoides are unusual GTPases because they act as GAPs for each other. We show that the reciprocal GTPase stimulation occurs when the G-domains of the proteins are combined in vitro. This finding indicates that important elements of the basic GTPase activation mechanism reside in the G-domains as such and that the other domains of Ffh and FtsY only serve to modulate the activation. We also show that binding of GTP to Ffh results in significant conformational changes of the protein. In particular, a region near the C-terminus of the G-domain becomes more ordered as a result of nucleotide binding. This region is close to sites where the G-domain interacts with other domains of the protein. Therefore, the structural changes that we observe may be part of a mechanism where GTP binding induces conformational changes in other domains of Ffh. OBP acts as the initiator for replication of the HSV- 1 genome. It acts by converting the double-stranded origin of DNA replication oriS to an activated partially single-stranded conformation referred to as oriS*. The reaction requires ATP hydrolysis. We demonstrate genetically that oriS* most likely is formed in vivo. We also show that oriS* is an efficient activator of ATP hydrolysis and that stimulation of ATP hydrolysis requires binding to a hairpin containing the recognition sequence for OBP and position-specific base-contacts with a 3 ' single-stranded tail. Gel retardation experiments indicate furthermore that OBP adopts different conformations in the presence of ATP or ADP. Finally, the diverse roles that RNA and DNA have on regulation of hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Despite being some of {{the most}} {{familiar}} objects observed in the sky, much remains unknown about open clusters. The theory of their formation admits many unanswered questions, and the complex dynamics of their evolution remains an extremely difficult problem to address. In this thesis, I present results that both help to constrain formation theories, as well as to shed new understanding on the many physical processes that drive their evolution. Starting with a photometric catalog of a cluster, I employ a maximum likelihood technique to determine the mass distribution of its members, including single stars and both components of binary systems. This method allows me to determine not just the fraction of systems which are binary, but also the typical degree of correlation between the masses of their components. I also examine the spatial distribution of the cluster members. The issue of mass segregation is also addressed, introducing a new method for quantifying it. After quantifying many different properties of the cluster, N-body simulations are used to find the initial state that evolves to most closely match the current cluster. Although a few similar studies have been done in the past, I use a far larger breadth of parameters to compare with the actual data than any previous work. This results in a fairly confident determination of the properties of very young clusters, which any theory of cluster formation will be required to explain. How the cluster evolves from that initial state to the current day and beyond is also examined in detail. These techniques are used to examine two relatively close and well-known examples of open clusters: the Pleiades and the Alpha Persei cluster. In the case of the former, I find in particular that the overall binary fraction is as high as 76 %, significantly higher than the accepted field-star result. The primary and secondary masses within binaries are found to be correlated, in the sense that their ratios are closer to unity than under the hypothesis of random pairing. I also find unambiguous evidence of mass segregation within the cluster. Building on these results, I find the original cluster, newly stripped of gas, to have already had a virial radius of 4 pc. This configuration was larger than most observed, embedded clusters. Over time, the cluster expanded further and the central surface density fell by about a factor of two. I attribute both effects to the <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> from tightening binaries of short period. Indeed, the original binary fraction was close to unity. The ancient Pleiades also had significant mass segregation, which persists in the cluster today. In the future, the central density of the Pleiades will continue to fall. For the first few hundred Myr, the cluster as a whole will expand because of dynamical heating by binaries. The expansion process is aided by mass loss through stellar evolution, which weakens the system's gravitational binding. At later times, the Galactic tidal field begins to heavily deplete the cluster mass. Barring destruction by close passage of a giant molecular cloud, the density falloff will continue for as long as 1 Gyr, by which time most of the cluster mass will have been tidally stripped away by the Galactic field. This same analysis is also applied to Alpha Persei. Here I fist compile the most complete photometric catalog of the system to date. The stellar mass function is found to be weighted more heavily toward higher-mass stars than in the Pleiades. Also in contrast with the Pleiades, I find there to be essentially no mass segregation in the cluster, either today or in its initial state. The binary fraction, however, is found to be quite similar between the two clusters, as high as 70 % in Alpha Persei. Once more the initial state is found to be quite large compared to embedded systems. The results of these two clusters together argue strongly the young clusters experience a period of significant expansion associated with the loss of their natal gas. Over time, Alpha Persei will globally expanded {{as a result of the}} Galactic tidal field. Dynamical heating by binaries, along with mass loss through stellar evolution, will also inflate the cluster into the future. I predict that Alpha Persei will completely dissolve within the next 300 Myr. Utilizing a series of N-body simulations, I go on to argue that gravitationally bound stellar clusters of modest population evolve very differently from the picture presented by classical dynamical relaxation theory. The system's most massive stars rapidly sink towards the center and form binary systems. These binaries efficiently heat the cluster, reversing any incipient core contraction and driving a subsequent phase of global expansion. Most previous theoretical studies demonstrating deep and persistent dynamical relaxation have either conflated the process with mass segregation, ignored three-body interactions, or else adopted the artificial assumption that all cluster members are single stars of identical mass. In such a uniform-mass cluster, binary formation is greatly delayed, as we confirm here both numerically and analytically. The relative duration of core contraction and global expansion is effected by stellar evolution, which causes the most massive stars to die out before they form binaries. In clusters of higher N, the epoch of dynamical relaxation lasts for progressively longer periods. By extrapolating our results to much larger populations we can understand, at least qualitatively, why some globular clusters reach the point of true core collapse...|$|E
40|$|Cataclysmic {{variables}} (classical novae and dwarf novae) are {{binary star}} systems {{in which a}} red dwarf transfers hydrogen-rich matter, by way of an accretion disk, to its white dwarf companion 1. In dwarf novae, an instability is believed to episodically dump much of the accretion disk onto the white dwarf. The <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> gravitational potential <b>energy</b> then brightens these systems by up to 100 -fold every few weeks or months. Thermonuclear-powered eruptions thousands of times more luminous occur in classical novae 5, accompanied by significant mass ejection 6 and formation of clearly visible shells from the ejected material. Theory predicts that the white dwarfs in all dwarf novae must eventually accrete enough mass to undergo classical nova eruptions 9. Here we report a shell, {{an order of magnitude}} more extended than those detected around many classical novae, surrounding the prototypical dwarf nova Z Camelopardalis. The derived shell mass matches that of classical novae, and is inconsistent with the mass expected from a dwarf nova wind or a planetary nebula. The shell observationally links the prototypical dwarf nova Z Camelopardalis with an ancient nova eruption and the classical nova process...|$|R

Can the <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> the spirit be fully achieved without concern for the <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> the body from political oppression? This brief essay will explore the tension between these two definitions <b>of</b> <b>liberation</b> and the tension between advocacy for the <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> the spirit from {{the body and the}} <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> the body from political oppression. I will argue that the fierce power of our compassion, as instruments of the compassion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, must be better directed at those peoples and living beings who are oppressed and marginalized in our contemporary world because of distinct political and socio-economic conditions. I will attempt to frame a discussion and argument which bridges the unnecessary dualistic divide between the <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> the spirit and the <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> the body, in order to help strengthen our commitment to our ultimate concern as devotees and followers of Caitanya Vaishnavism...|$|R
