5|$|Number {{names are}} {{rendered}} {{in the language}} of the country, but are similar everywhere due to shared etymology. Some languages, particularly in East Asia and South Asia, have large number naming systems that are different from both the <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>short</b> scales, for example the Indian numbering system.|$|E
5|$|The <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>short</b> {{scales are}} two of several large-number naming systems for integer powers of ten that use the same words with {{different}} meanings. The long scale is based on powers of one million, whereas the short scale is based on powers of one thousand.|$|E
5|$|To avoid {{confusion}} which {{result of}} coexistence of {{short and long}} term in any language, the SI recommend to use the Metric prefix which keep the same meaning regardless of the country and the language. <b>Long</b> <b>and</b> <b>short</b> scales remains used de facto for counting money.|$|E

5|$|T.chatareus can be {{distinguished}} by their sooty colour, {{as opposed to the}} typical silver of most other archerfish. They have five dorsal spines, whereas T.jaculatrix have four. The markings on their flanks are also alternating <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>short</b> spots rather than bands. T.chatareus also have six or seven markings on its sides, whilst banded archerfish have four to five. T.chatareus has 29–30 lateral line scales, compared to 33–35 in T. jaculatrix. T.chatareus are also less common upstream than T.microlepis.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{wide range}} of names for other types of feet, right up to a choriamb, a four {{syllable}} metric foot with a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables and closing with a stressed syllable. The choriamb is derived from some ancient Greek and Latin poetry. Languages which utilize vowel length or intonation rather than or in addition to syllabic accents in determining meter, such as Ottoman Turkish or Vedic, often have concepts similar to the iamb and dactyl to describe common combinations of <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>short</b> sounds.|$|E
5|$|Vowel length. The {{pronunciation}} of <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>short</b> vowels {{depends on}} the syllable's position in the word. In word-initial syllables there is a phonemic contrast in length. A long vowel has about 208% {{the length of a}} short vowel. In word-medial and word-final syllables, formerly long vowels are now only 127% as long as short vowels in initial syllables, but they are still distinct from initial-syllable short vowels. Short vowels in noninitial syllables differ from short vowels in initial syllables by being only 71% as long and by being centralized in articulation. As they are nonphonemic, their position is determined according to phonotactic requirements.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, the Somali Film Agency (SFA), the nation's film {{regulatory}} body, was established. An {{adjunct to}} the federal Ministry of Information and National Guidance, it {{grew out of the}} Ministry's visual aids arm. The SFA's duties included overseeing the importation, distribution and censorship of movies in the country. It later also oversaw the production of both <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>short</b> films. Most of the imported films were brought in from Egypt, Italy, the Soviet Union and East Germany. To facilitate processing and post-production, the SFA also forged a working partnership with British Films LTD, a British movie company. From 1979 to 1983, the Somali film producer and director Ali Said Hassan served as the SFA's representative in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Nablus costume {{was of a}} {{distinctive}} style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics. Due to its position as important trade center with a flourishing souk ("market"), in late 19th century, {{there was a large}} choice of fabrics available in the city, from Damascus and Aleppo silk to Manchester cottons and calicos. Similar in construction to the garments worn in the Galilee, both <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>short</b> Turkish style jackets were worn over the thob ("robe"). For daily wear, thobs were often made of white cotton or linen, with a preference for winged sleeves. In the summer, costumes often incorporated interwoven striped bands of red, green and yellow on the front and back, with appliqué and braidwork popularly decorating the qabbeh ("square chest piece").|$|E
5|$|At the December 2010 FINA Short Course World Swimming Championships in Dubai, Cielo, {{along with}} Nicholas Santos, Nicolas Oliveira and Marcelo Chierighini, won the bronze {{medal in the}} 4×100-metre freestyle, {{with a time of}} 3:05.74, setting a South American record and leaving behind the US team. In the 50-metre freestyle, Cielo twice broke the Americas record, earning 20.61 seconds in the heats, and winning the gold medal with a time of 20.51 seconds, a new Americas and Championship record, just 0.21 seconds slower than Roland Schoeman's world record. (Schoeman broke the world record using super-suit {{technology}} in 2009, when it was still allowed, while Cielo made his time without a super-suit.) His time became the third fastest of any ever achieved in the event, and a world textile best. In the 100-metre freestyle, Cielo also won the gold with a time of 45.74 seconds, a South American and championship record. With that, Cielo, at 23 years old, managed to unify the world titles of the two events: the 50-metre and the 100-metre freestyle in both the <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>short</b> courses. Completing his participation in the Short Course Worlds, Cielo led the Brazilian 4×100-metre medley relay team of Guilherme Guido, Felipe França Silva and Kaio de Almeida to win the bronze medal. The team broke the South American record with a time of 3:23.12.|$|E

5|$|Since 1788, English {{has been}} spoken in Oceania, and Australian English has {{developed}} as a first language {{of the vast majority}} of the inhabitants of the Australian continent, its standard accent being General Australian. The English of neighbouring New Zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language. Australian and New Zealand English are each other's closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics, followed by South African English and the English of southeastern England, all of which have similarly non-rhotic accents, aside from some accents in the South Island of New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand English stand out for their innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>short</b> vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar aligns closely to British and American English; like American English, collective plural subjects take on a singular verb (as in the government is rather than are). New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English.|$|E
