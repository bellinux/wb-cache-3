5|$|The <b>limpkin</b> {{is an odd}} {{bird that}} looks like a large rail, but is skeletally closer to the cranes. It is found in marshes with some trees or scrub in the Caribbean, South America and {{southern}} Florida.|$|E
5|$|The <b>limpkin</b> {{is a large}} bird in a {{monotypic}} family. It {{is similar}} in appearance to the rails, but skeletally it {{is closer to the}} cranes. It is found in marshes and gets its common name from its appearance of limping as it walks.|$|E
40|$|Cranes {{and their}} {{relatives}} the <b>limpkins</b> and trumpeters are fairly closely related members {{of the order of}} birds (Gruiformes) that also includes rails, gallinules, coots, and other marsh-adapted birds. Cranes, <b>limpkins,</b> and trumpeters are usually included within a superfamily, Gruoidea, although at least one recent authority (Cracraft, 1973) has suggested that the three groups all be included within a single family, Gruidae. However, traditionally only the cranes have been included within the Gruidae, and only the cranes will be dealt with in detail in this book. Nevertheless, the <b>limpkins</b> and trumpeters must be considered if the evolution of cranes is to be discussed, and thus it is perhaps desirable to define each of these three groups in a semiformal way, so that their similarities and differences are at once apparent...|$|R
25|$|<b>Limpkins</b> are {{reported}} to be attacked and eaten by American alligators. There are also reports of adults with serious foot and leg injuries, suggesting {{that they may have}} been attacked by turtles while standing on floating vegetation. Their nests are apparently predated by snakes, raccoons, crows and muskrats. Foraging adults may in times of drought be victims of kleptoparasitism by snail kites, and the attempted theft of apple snails caught by <b>limpkins</b> has also been observed in boat-tailed grackles.|$|R
50|$|Park {{wildlife}} includes manatees, alligators, white-tailed deer, turtles and otters. Among {{the birds}} {{that can be}} seen are anhingas, egrets, hawks, <b>limpkins,</b> ospreys, vultures, American bald eagles, American white ibis, belted kingfishers, American coots and great blue herons.|$|R
5|$|Puerto Rico's {{avifauna}} {{has diminished}} due to extinction and extirpation, either by natural forces or human intervention. For example, fossil evidence was discovered for {{a species of}} swift, Tachornis uranoceles, dated to the late Pleistocene (between 17,000 and 21,000 years ago). The species {{is believed to have}} become extinct as a result of habitat alteration after the Wisconsin glaciation. At least six endemic species have become extinct in the last millennia: Puerto Rican barn owl (Tyto cavatica), Puerto Rican caracara (Polyborus latebrosus), Puerto Rican conure (Aratinga chloroptera maugei), Puerto Rican woodcock (Scolopax anthonyi), Puerto Rican quail-dove (Geotrygon larva), and the Antillean cave rail (Nesotrochis debooyi). With a population of 13 individuals in 1975, the Puerto Rican parrot almost became the seventh, but conservation efforts helped save the species from extinction. However, it {{is still one of the}} ten most critically endangered birds in the world. Four Puerto Rican birds, the Hispaniolan parakeet, the white-necked crow, the Cuban crow, and the <b>limpkin,</b> became extirpated after Puerto Rico's population expansion in the latter half of the nineteenth century and three more species, the black-bellied whistling duck, the black rail, and the American flamingo, no longer breed in the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|The <b>limpkin</b> {{is placed}} in its own {{monotypic}} family, Aramidae, which is in turn placed within the crane and rail order Gruiformes. It had been suggested that the <b>limpkin</b> {{was close to the}} ibis and spoonbill family Threskiornithidae, based upon shared bird lice. The Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy of birds, based upon DNA–DNA hybridization, suggested that the limpkin's closest relatives were the Heliornithidae finfoots, and Sibley and Monroe even placed the species in that family in 1990. More recent studies have found little support for this relationship. More recent DNA studies have confirmed a close relationship with particularly the cranes, with the <b>limpkin</b> remaining as a family close to the cranes and the two being sister taxa to the trumpeters.|$|E
25|$|Many of the limpkin's names {{across its}} range are onomatopoeic and reflect the bird's call; for example carau in Argentina, carrao in Venezuela and guareáo in Cuba. The species {{also has a}} range of common names that refer to its call, for example lamenting bird, or to its {{supposed}} gait, crippled bird. The <b>limpkin</b> does not feature much in folklore, although in the Amazon people believe that when the <b>limpkin</b> starts to call the river will not rise anymore.|$|E
25|$|<b>Limpkins</b> may {{be either}} monogamous, with females joining a male's territory, or {{serially}} polyandrous, {{with two or}} more females joining a male. With the monogamous pairs, banding {{studies have shown that}} a small number of pairs will reform the following year (4 out of 18 pairs).|$|R
50|$|The Lake Woodruff Wilderness Area {{is part of}} the refuge, and {{consists}} of 1066 acre or 4.9% of the Refuge's total area. Alligators, bald eagles, and <b>limpkins</b> are among the wildlife that {{can be found in the}} area. Deer hunting is allowed, but the hunting is managed.|$|R
2500|$|It inhabits {{freshwater}} {{marshes and}} swamps, often with tall reeds, {{as well as}} mangroves. In the Caribbean, it also inhabits dry brushland. In Mexico and northern Central America, it occurs at altitudes up to [...] In Florida the distribution of apple snails is {{the best predictor of}} where <b>limpkins</b> can be found.|$|R
25|$|<b>Limpkin</b> {{continued}} {{this pattern}} of service, perfecting the dangerous art of mine warfare in operations along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean until late 1968.|$|E
25|$|<b>Limpkin</b> was {{transferred}} to Indonesia in 1971, and renamed Pulau Anjer (M-719). She was struck from the Naval Register, 1 May 1976; and disposed of for scrap through the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service on 1 September 1976.|$|E
25|$|Transferred to Mine Division 41 on New Year's Day, during 1956, <b>Limpkin</b> {{worked with}} the Mine Evaluation Depot, Key West; spent a gruelling month {{undergoing}} refresher training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and participated in a minesweeping exercise with the Atlantic Fleet.|$|E
25|$|<b>Limpkins</b> {{are active}} {{during the day}} but will also forage at night. Where they are not persecuted they are also very tame and approachable. Even so, they are usually found near cover. They are not {{aggressive}} for the most part, being unconcerned by other species and rarely fighting with {{members of their own}} species.|$|R
50|$|The Wacissa is {{well known}} for its large {{concentration}} of aquatic birds, including egrets, herons, ibis, osprey, wood storks, <b>limpkins,</b> anhingas, kingfishers, barred owls and bald eagles. Aquatic animals are also abundant, including alligators, river otters, turtles, water snakes, and crayfish. The main species of fish are bass, mullet, catfish, red-breasted sunfish, stumpknocker and gar, although the warmouth perch, speckled perch, flier bream, and shellcracker may also found in the Wacissa.|$|R
25|$|<b>Limpkins</b> in Florida were {{examined}} for parasites, which included trematodes, nematodes and biting lice. Two biting lice species were found, Laemobothrion cubense and Rallicola funebris. The trematode Prionosoma serratum {{was found in}} the intestines of some birds, this species may enter the bird after first infecting apple snails (this {{has been shown to be}} the route of infection for a closely related trematode to infect snail kites). Nematodes Amidostomum acutum and Strongyloides sp. are also ingested and live in the gut.|$|R
25|$|The <b>limpkin</b> occurs from peninsular Florida (and {{formerly}} the Okefenokee Swamp in southern Georgia) and southern Mexico through the Caribbean and Central America to northern Argentina. In South America it occurs widely {{east of the}} Andes; west of them its range extends only to the Equator.|$|E
25|$|The second ship to {{be named}} <b>Limpkin</b> by the Navy was laid down 17 April 1953, as AMS-195, by Broward Marine, Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Florida; {{launched}} 22 May 1954; sponsored by Mrs. Edward Applegate; reclassified MSC-195 on 7 February 1955; and commissioned 10 April 1955, Lieutenant Thomas E. Vines in command.|$|E
25|$|The diet of the <b>limpkin</b> is {{dominated}} by apple snails (Ampullariidae) of the genus Pomacea. The availability of this one mollusk has {{a significant effect on}} the local distribution of the <b>limpkin.</b> Freshwater mussels, including Anodonta cowperiana, Villosa vibex, Elliptio strigosus, E. jayensis, and Uniomerus obesus, as well as other kinds of snails, are a secondary food sources. Less important prey items are insects, frogs, lizards, crustaceans and worms. These prey items may be important in periods of drought or flooding when birds may be pushed into less than optimal foraging areas. In one site in Florida, moon snails and mussels were the most important prey items. Two studies, both in Florida, have looked at the percentage composition of the diet of limpkins. One, looking at stomach contents, found 70% Pomacea apple snails, 3% Campeloma and 27% unidentified mollusc, probably Pomacea.|$|E
50|$|The {{expanse of}} Aucilla WMA and its {{diversity}} of habitats provides {{a home to}} a large diversity of animal species. Mammals range from Florida black bears and bobcats to North American river otters and white-tailed deer. The property {{is part of the}} Great Florida Birding and Wildlife Trail due to its abundance of warblers, <b>limpkins</b> and wood storks, along with many other migratory and resident bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are represented by species such as eastern diamondback rattlesnakes, gopher tortoises and American alligator s.|$|R
2500|$|Males have {{exclusive}} territories, {{which can}} vary {{in size from}} [...] In large uniform swamps, nesting territories can often be clumped together, {{in the form of}} large colonies. These are vigorously defended, with males flying to the territory edges to challenge intruders and passing <b>limpkins</b> being chased out of the territory. Territorial displays between males at boundaries include ritualized charging and wing-flapping. Females may also participate in territorial defence but usually only against other females or juveniles. Territories may be maintained year-round or abandoned temporarily during the non-breeding season, usually due to lack of food.|$|R
50|$|Eogruidae (also spelled Eogruiidae in some publications) is {{a family}} of large, flightless birds that {{occurred}} across Eurasia from the Eocene to Pliocene epochs. Related to modern cranes, <b>limpkins</b> and trumpeters, these birds converged strongly with ostriches due to similar speciations to cursoriality, even reducing their number of toes to two in some taxa. It {{has been suggested that}} competition from true ostriches has caused the extinction of these birds, though this has never been formally tested and several ostrich taxa do occur in the late Cenozoic of Asia and some species do occur in areas where ostrich fossils have also been found.|$|R
25|$|After {{reporting}} to Mine Division 45 at Charleston, South Carolina, 15 April 1955, the new coastal minesweeper proceeded to Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, for shakedown. Returning to Charleston on 19 June, <b>Limpkin</b> trained with the Fleet Sonar School, Key West, Florida, 20 July to 3 August, then returned home for operations off South Carolina and a post shake down overhaul.|$|E
25|$|The <b>limpkin</b> (Aramus guarauna), {{also called}} carrao, courlan, and crying bird, is {{a bird that}} looks like a large rail but is skeletally closer to cranes. It is the only extant species in the genus Aramus and the family Aramidae. It is found mostly in {{wetlands}} in warm parts of the Americas, from Florida to northern Argentina. It feeds on molluscs, with the diet dominated by apple snails of the genus Pomacea. Its name derives from its seeming limp when it walks.|$|E
25|$|Between 1856 and 1934 the <b>limpkin</b> {{was treated}} as two species, one in South America (Aramus guarauna) and the other found in Central America, the Caribbean and Florida (Aramus pictus). Today it is treated as a single species with four subspecies. Along with the {{nominate}} subspecies A. g. guarauna there is A. g. dolosus and A. g. elucus (both J. L. Peters, 1925) and A. g. pictus (F. A. A. Meyer, 1794). The difference between the subspecies are related to slight differences in size and plumage.|$|E
50|$|Males have {{exclusive}} territories, {{which can}} vary {{in size from}} 0.15 to 4 ha. In large uniform swamps, nesting territories can often be clumped together, {{in the form of}} large colonies. These are vigorously defended, with males flying to the territory edges to challenge intruders and passing <b>limpkins</b> being chased out of the territory. Territorial displays between males at boundaries include ritualized charging and wing-flapping. Females may also participate in territorial defence but usually only against other females or juveniles. Territories may be maintained year-round or abandoned temporarily during the non-breeding season, usually due to lack of food.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Limpkins</b> forage {{primarily}} {{in shallow water}} and on floating vegetation such as water hyacinth and water lettuce. When wading they seldom go deeper than having half the body underwater, and never are submerged up to the back. They walk slowly with a gait described as [...] "slightly undulating" [...] and [...] "giving the impression of lameness or limping", [...] "high-stepping", or [...] "strolling", looking for food if the water is clear or probing with the bill. They do not associate with other birds in mixed-species feeding flocks, as do some other wading birds, but may forage in small groups with others of their species.|$|R
50|$|<b>Limpkins</b> may {{be either}} monogamous, with females joining a male's territory, or {{serially}} polyandrous, {{with two or}} more females joining a male. With the monogamous pairs, banding {{studies have shown that}} a small number of pairs will reform the following year (4 out of 18 pairs).Nests may be built {{in a wide variety of}} places - on the ground, in dense floating vegetation, in bushes, or at any height in trees. They are bulky structures of rushes, sticks or other materials. Nest building is undertaken by the male initially, who will construct the nest in his territory prior to pair-bond formation. Unpaired females will visit a number of territories before settling on a male to breed with. Males may initially challenge and fight off prospective mates, and may not accept first-year females as mates. Pair-bond formation may take a few weeks. Courtship feeding is part of the bonding process, where males catch and process a snail and then feed it to the female.|$|R
25|$|Although the <b>limpkin</b> is {{the only}} extant species in the family today, there are several fossils of extinct Aramidae known from across the Americas. The {{earliest}} known species in the genus Aramus, Aramus paludigrus is dated to the middle Miocene, while the oldest supposed members of the family, Aminornis and Loncornis, {{have been found in}} early Oligocene deposits in Argentina, although it is not certain that these are indeed related – in fact Loncornis seems to be a misidentified mammal bone. Another Oligocene fossil from Europe, Parvigrus pohli (family Parvigruidae), {{has been described as a}} mosaic of the features shared by the limpkins and the cranes. It shares many morphological features with the cranes and limpkins, but also was much smaller than either group, and was more rail-like in its proportions. In the paper describing the fossil Gerald Mayr suggested that it was similar to the stem species of the grues (the cranes and limpkins), and that the limpkins evolved massively long bills as a result of the specialisation to feeding on snails. In contrast, the cranes evolved into long-legged forms to walk and probe on open grasslands.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Limpkin</b> {{is a large}} bird in a {{monotypic}} family. It {{is similar}} in appearance to the rails, but skeletally it {{is closer to the}} cranes. It is found in marshes and gets its common name from its appearance of limping as it walks.|$|E
500|$|Aramidopsis [...] {{derives from}} the genus name of the <b>limpkin,</b> Aramus and the Greek suffix opsis, [...] "resembling". Although the rail shares the origin of its name with the South American Aramides species, its {{distinctive}} bill, thick legs and barred lower belly distinguish it from that group. The species name [...] plateni commemorates Carl Constantin Platen, a German doctor who collected birds and butterflies in the Malay Archipelago and gave Blasius his specimen of the rail. The common name refers to the rail's distinctive call, and {{was given to the}} bird as der Vogel Schnarch (the snoring bird) by German entomologist Gerd Heinrich when he rediscovered the species in 1932.|$|E

40|$|Canals {{surrounding}} the Everglades carry enriched and polluted water high in minerals and nutrients. These enriched waters impact adjacent marsh habitats, altering {{flora and fauna}} species and abundance. Multiple studies have found gradients in nutrient levels {{as a function of}} distance from canals and emphasize the sensitivity of some organisms to these changes in water chemistry. Florida apple snails, Pomacea paludosa Say, are just one of many Everglades species sensitive to changes in water chemistry. They serve as an important staple in the diets of many Everglades predators including turtles, crayfish, <b>limpkins</b> and most importantly the endangered snail kite, Rostrahamus sociabilis which feeds almost exclusively on the apple snail. To examine potential effects of water chemistry on apple snail breeding patterns, we observed snail egg size, egg number per clutch, and carbon and nitrogen contents along water chemistry gradients and among snail breeding months at the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Egg number per clutch and egg diameters were greatest in the most impacted zones and lowest in the pristine, interior zone. Carbon contents of eggs were highest in the interior and east side of the Refuge and lowest in the west side. Nitrogen contents of eggs were highest in the interior and west side of the Refuge, and lowest in the east side. Significant, albeit weak, positive trends were found between N content and egg diameter, C content and egg diameter, and between egg number per clutch and egg diameter, but only among specific zones and months. Results from this study suggest that snails in areas of the Refuge that are influenced by canal-water may produce greater numbers of apple snail offspring with greater egg diameters than those in less impacted areas. However, we do not know if this translates into higher hatchling success and survival...|$|R
