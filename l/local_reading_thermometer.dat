40|$|We {{investigated}} the acoustical information {{present in the}} field of arbitrary sound sources which may provide direction and distance to the source from a <b>local</b> <b>reading</b> of the sound field parameters. If the effects of reflections are negligible, the particle acceleration is directed radially at the instant of sound pressure nulls. The spectral relation between the radial component of the particle aceleration and the sound pressure is characterized by a critical frequency where a sharp transition occurs in the amplitude ratio and the phase relation of these variables. The critical frequency depends on the distance to the source and depends little on the source type (mono-, di- or quadrupole). Thus, a <b>local</b> <b>reading</b> of the particle acceleration and the sound pressure is in principle sufficient to localize the sound source in three dimensions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} quorum leases, a {{new technique}} that al-lows Paxos-based systems to perform reads with high through-put and low latency. Quorum leases do not sacrifice consis-tency and have only a small impact on system availability and write latency. Quorum leases allow a majority of replicas to perform strongly consistent <b>local</b> <b>reads,</b> which substantially reduces read latency at those replicas (e. g., by two orders of magnitude in wide-area scenarios). Previous techniques for performing <b>local</b> <b>reads</b> in Paxos systems either (a) sacrifice consistency; (b) allow only one replica to read locally; or (c) decrease {{the availability of the}} system and increase the latency of all updates by requiring all replicas to be notified synchronously.

40|$|Hypothermia in newborn babies is {{a problem}} in {{tropical}} countries despite warm environmental conditions and it contributes to neonatal morbidity and mortality. This cohort study was done in the Neonatal Care unit, Muhimbili Medical Centre to determine the prevalence of hypothermia on admission, associated factors and neonatal outcome in terms of morbidity, weight loss, duration of stay in the neonatal unit and mortality. The study was conducted from July to October 1996 and the study population included all neonates admitted to the Neonatal Care Unit during the said period. The prevalence of hypothermia on admission was found to be 22. 4 % and hypothermia was not recorded or reported to be a reason for admission in any of the neonates in this study, despite that 13. 1 % of the hypothermic neonates had severe hypothermia on admission. There was no low <b>reading</b> <b>thermometer</b> in the unit. Hypothermia on admission was significantly associated with maternal intrapartum medications (P = 0. 04), delivery by doctor (P = 0. 000), delivery at Muhimbili Medical Centre Obstetrics Theatre (P = 0. 000) or delivery in other hospitals(p = 0. 00), delivery by lower segment Caesarian section (P = 0. 000) or by low cavity vaccum extraction (P = 0. 01), low birth weight (P = 0. 002), prematurity (P = 0. 001), longer duration of transfer from place of delivery to the Neonatal Care Unit (P = 0. 000) and inadequate clothing ofthe baby after delivery (P = 0. 000). It was also iii found that hypothermic neonates stayed longer in the Neonatal Care Unit than normothermic ones, they had more postnatal weight loss and increased risk of both morbidity and mortality. It is concluded that hypothermia {{is a problem}} in the Neonatal Care Unit, Muhimbili Medical Centre and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Efforts should be made to raise awareness among health providers with more emphasis on prevention.

40|$|Models of {{competent}} writing {{indicate the}} importance of reading the developing text {{as a part of}} composing (e. g. Hayes, 1996), yet we know little about the role reading plays in adolescent writing. Hayes (1996) proposed that reading "the text so far" influences cognitive processes such as text production, reflection, and text interpretation as the writer composes Empirical work has shown that reading during writing can serve text generation processes and contribute to text quality (Breetvelt et al., 1996; van den Bergh & Rijlaarsdam, 1999), but only when time is taken into account. For example, reading that occurs {{at the beginning of a}} writing session (reading the assignment/prompt) may serve different purposes and have different effects upon writer's plans than reading to evaluate previously written sentences or paragraphs. This study uses eye tracking technology to examine adolescent students' reading processes while composing two texts, and explores relationships between reading during writing, gender, and text quality. Two groups of students (boys and girls) composed narratives and persuasive essays while their eye movements were recorded. Reading patterns were coded according to the location of eye fixations upon the text: reading at the point of inscription (rereading the most recently composed 1 - 3 words); <b>local</b> <b>reading</b> (rereading the recently composed sentence); global reading (reading previously composed text, not including the most recent sentence); and prompt (reading the writing prompt). Using HLM to analyze relationships between reading patterns, time, and text quality, we found that those who wrote higher quality texts engaged in more local and point of inscription, reading processes, while global reading patterns were not significantly related to text quality. Girls wrote higher quality texts and demonstrated more <b>local</b> <b>reading</b> than boys. <b>Local</b> <b>reading</b> and reading at the point of inscription may serve text quality by facilitating sentence-level and clause-level text generation processe...|$|R
