40|$|Mixed integer {{programming}} (MIP) {{has been used}} for optimizing production schedules of mines since the 1960 s. The major problem in. the long-term production scheduling for an entire orebody is that the number of integer variables needed to formulate an MIP model is too large to solve the formulation. This number may reach well over one hundred thousand. To overcome this difficulty, this paper presents two new algorithms {{to reduce the size of}} the problem. These algorithms assign an earliest and latest possible start date for each machine placement, eliminating the integer variables that correspond to machine placement before its early start date and after its <b>late</b> <b>start</b> <b>date.</b> A case study based on Kiruna Mine, the second largest underground mine in the world, is summarized in the paper. it shows substantial improvement in the solution time required using the new algorithms.

40|$|Rift Valley fever (RVF) {{is a major}} vector-borne {{zoonosis}} first {{identified on}} the African continent in the early 1900 s. In 2000, RVF was reported {{for the first time}} in Yemen. In this study, we provide a descriptive analysis of the period 1999 - 2007 in Yemen, taking into account the environmental and socioeconomic factors likely to have been involved in the emergence of RVF in the country. We characterize each year in the study period by the environmental conditions (linked to vegetation indexes), the festival calendar, and economic data. We then use a principal component analysis to synthesize the different variables, assess whether the year 2000 was atypical compared with other years in the study period, and, if that was the case, in what respect. Our results show that 2000 presented above-normal vegetation index values, which reflect important precipitation, for both the two rainy seasons (the first between March and May; the second between July and October). These environmental conditions, ones favorable to mosquito vector populations, coincided that year with a <b>late</b> (March) <b>starting</b> <b>date</b> of the Eid al-Kabeer festival, which corresponds to a period with high host (cattle, sheep, goats) densities. According to these criteria, 2000 was an atypical year.

40|$|Background: Antipsychotic therapy {{can reduce}} severe {{symptoms}} of psychiatric disorders, however, data on school performance among children on such treatment are lacking. The {{objective was to}} explore school performance among children using antipsychotic drugs {{at the end of}} primary education. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using the University Groningen pharmacy database linked to academic achievement scores at the end of primary school (Dutch Cito-test) obtained from Statistics Netherlands. Mean Cito-test scores and standard deviations were obtained for children on antipsychotic therapy and reference children, and statistically compared using analyses of covariance. In addition, differences in subgroups as boys versus girls, ethnicity, household income, and <b>late</b> starters (<b>start</b> <b>date</b> within 12 months of the Cito-test) versus early starters (<b>start</b> <b>date</b> > 12 months before the Cito-test) were tested. Results: In all, data from 7994 children could be linked to Cito-test scores. At the time of the Cito-test, 45 (0. 6 %) were on treatment with antipsychotics. Children using antipsychotics scored on average 3. 6 points lower than the reference peer group (534. 5 +/- 9. 5). Scores were different across gender and levels of household income (p < 0. 05). Scores of early starters were significantly higher than starters within 12 months (533. 7 +/- 1. 7 vs. 524. 1 +/- 2. 6). Conclusion: This first exploration showed that children on antipsychotic treatment have lower school performance compared to the reference peer group at the end of primary school. This was most noticeable for girls, but early starters were less affected than later starters. Due to the observational cross-sectional nature of this study, no causality can be inferred, but the results indicate that school performance should be closely monitored and causes of underperformance despite treatment warrants more research...|$|R

However {{it is one of}} the most difficult aspects of alfalfa production, in part because of the difficulty in monitoring and evaluating irrigation practices. The soil moisture content of several alfalfa fields was monitored over the last four years for the duration of the irrigation season using Watermark ® resistance blocks. Soil moisture content fluctuated considerably during the season; the driest periods corresponded with alfalfa harvests. Soil moisture content also varied greatly between growers reflecting differences in soil type and irrigation practices between farms.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} jobs that any manager can take on in the management of a large scale project that requires coordinating numerous activities throughout the organization. A myriad of details must be considered in planning how to coordinate all these activities, in developing a realistic schedule, and then in monitoring the progress of the project. Fortunately, two closely related operations research techniques, PERT (program evaluation and review techniques) and CPM (critical path method) were developed in the 50 's, within different contexts: the CPM was developed for planning and control of DuPont engineering projects and the PERT was developed for the management of the production cycle of the Polaris missile. They share the same objectives such as defining the project duration and the critical task.

40|$|Abstract Background Much {{remains unknown}} {{about the effect}} of timing and {{prioritization}} of vaccination against pandemic (pH 1 N 1) 2009 virus on health outcomes. We adapted a city-level contact network model to study different campaigns on influenza morbidity and mortality. Methods We modeled different distribution strategies initiated between July and November 2009 using a compartmental epidemic model that includes age structure and transmission network dynamics. The model represents the Greater Vancouver Regional District, a major North American city and surrounding suburbs with a population of 2 million, and is parameterized using data from the British Columbia Ministry of Health, published studies, and expert opinion. Outcomes are expressed as the number of infections and deaths averted due to vaccination. Results The model output was consistent with provincial surveillance data. Assuming a basic reproduction number = 1. 4, an 8 -week vaccination campaign initiated 2 weeks before the epidemic onset reduced morbidity and mortality by 79 - 91 % and 80 - 87 %, respectively, compared to no vaccination. Prioritizing children and parents for vaccination may have reduced transmission compared to actual practice, but the mortality benefit of this strategy appears highly sensitive to campaign timing. Modeling the actual <b>late</b> October <b>start</b> <b>date</b> resulted in modest reductions in morbidity and mortality (13 - 25 % and 16 - 20 %, respectively) with little variation by prioritization scheme. Conclusion Delays in vaccine production due to technological or logistical barriers may reduce potential benefits of vaccination for pandemic influenza, and these temporal effects can outweigh any additional theoretical benefits from population targeting. Careful modeling may provide decision makers with estimates of these effects before the epidemic peak to guide production goals and inform policy. Integration of real-time surveillance data with mathematical models holds the promise of enabling public health planners to optimize the community benefits from proposed interventions before the pandemic peak. </p...|$|R
