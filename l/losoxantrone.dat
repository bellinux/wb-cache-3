50|$|<b>Losoxantrone</b> (biantrazole) is a anthroquinone anthrapyrazole antineoplastic {{agent and}} analog of mitoxantrone. It is also {{sometimes}} known as DuP 941.|$|E
40|$|<b>Losoxantrone</b> is a DNA {{intercalator}} {{that was}} developed {{with the potential to}} replace anthracyclines. The recommended single agent dose of <b>losoxantrone</b> is 50 [*]mg[*]m− 2 every 3 weeks. We conducted a phase I study of <b>losoxantrone</b> and a fixed dose of cyclophosphamide on a q 3 weekly schedule. Forty-nine patients were enrolled, of which 46 were evaluable for toxicity. The dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia at the maximum tolerable <b>losoxantrone</b> dose of 45 [*]mg[*]m− 2. With granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support, significant further dose escalation of <b>losoxantrone</b> was achieved. Cardiotoxicity was seen with cumulative dosing. Pharmacokinetics of <b>losoxantrone</b> revealed linear kinetics and triphasic clearance, with significant interpatient variability. No objective responses were seen in this study. Neutropenia was dose-limiting in this combination with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support. The recommended dose for further testing is cyclophosphamide 500 [*]mg[*]m− 2 followed by <b>losoxantrone</b> 95 [*]mg[*]m− 2 with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Systematic {{investigation}} of a novel series of intercalating agents, 9 -aza-anthrapyrazoles, {{has led to the}} identification of a promising analogue, BBR 3438. This study describes the antitumour efficacy of the novel compound in human prostate carcinoma models and the molecular/cellular basis of its activity. Methods and Results: The novel 9 -aza-anthrapyrazole BBR 3438 was significantly more effective than doxorubicin and <b>losoxantrone</b> (DuP- 941) in two of the three tested prostate carcinoma models. The superior activity was more evident in PC 3 tumour, since BBR 3438 produced an appreciable rate of complete tumour regressions. Under these conditions, the drug-induced antiproliferative activity paralleled delayed apoptosis. Tumour response to in vivo drug treatment was associated with an early down-regulation of Bcl- 2, which was somewhat more marked for the aza compound. In fact, the 9 -aza-anthrapyrazole induced DNA cleavage in vitro with isolated DNA topoisomerase II (isoform ·) and DNA strand breaks in prostatic carcinoma cells. Although the molecular effects of <b>losoxantrone</b> and the 9 -aza analogue on the enzyme target were comparable, the cytotoxic effects of BBR 3438 could be enhanced by long-term exposure as a consequence of favourable cellular accumulation and prominent DNA-binding affinity. In addition, a lower reduction potential of the 9 -aza-anthrapyrazole in comparison with classical anthrapyrazoles suggests an increased ability of the drug to induce oxidative stress following free radical production, which may be a contributing factor in determining the long-term response (i. e. delayed cell death) to genotoxic damage. Conclusions: BBR 3438 exhibited a unique profile of preclinical activity with a superior efficacy against prostatic carcinoma models compared to reference compounds (doxorubicin and <b>losoxantrone).</b> The antitumour efficacy of BBR 3438 against prostatic carcinoma could be the result of a combination of favourable events, including enhanced intracellular accumulation and an increased DNA-binding affinity favouring the accumulation of multiple sublethal or lethal damage. In spite of its enhanced cytotoxic potency, the 9 -aza compound was better tolerated in vivo than <b>losoxantrone,</b> thus improving the therapeutic index. The preclinical profile of efficacy against prostatic carcinoma, a tumour resistant to conventional antitumour drugs, makes the novel 9 -aza-anthrapyrazole BBR 3438 a promising candidate for clinical evaluation...|$|E

40|$|The {{physicochemical}} and DNA-binding {{properties of}} anticancer 9 -aza-anthrapyrazoles (9 -aza-APs) were investigated and {{compared with the}} carbocyclic analogs <b>losoxantrone</b> (LX) and mitoxantrone (MX). Unlike their carbocyclic counterparts, the tested 9 -aza-APs do not undergo self-aggregation phenomena. The pyridine nitrogen at position 9, missing in the carbocyclic derivatives, is involved in protonation equilibria at physiological pH. In addition, 9 -aza-APs are electrochemically reduced at a potential intermediate between LX and MX. These data fully agree with quantum mechanical calculations. Binding to nucleic acids was examined by spectroscopic, chiroptical, and DNase I footprinting techniques {{as a function of}} ionic strength and base composition. The 9 -aza-APs exhibit prominent affinity for DNA, with an important electrostatic contribution to the binding free energy. A very remarkable sequence preference pattern dramatically favors GC steps in double-helical DNA, whereas the carbocyclic reference compounds show a substantially lower selectivity for GC. A common DNA complexation geometry, considerably differing from that of MX, characterizes all anthrapyrazoles. Hence, bioisosteric substitution and ring-hydroxy deletion {{play an important role in}} defining the physicochemical properties and in modulating the affinity of anthrapyrazoles for the nucleic acid, the geometry of the intercalation complex, and the sequence specific contacts along the DNA chain. Drug stimulation of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage is remarkably attenuated in the aza-bioisosteric derivatives, suggesting that other non-enzyme-mediated cytotoxic mechanism(s), possibly connected with free radical production, are responsible for efficient cell killing. The biophysical and biochemical properties exhibited by 9 -aza-APs contribute to clarifying the peculiar pharmacological profile of this family of compound...|$|E
