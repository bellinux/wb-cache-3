50|$|Hycanthone is the schistosomicide {{approved}} by the FDA in 1975. It is a metabolite of <b>lucanthone.</b> Hycanthone interferes with parasite nerve function, resulting in paralysis and death.

50|$|Known inhibitors of APE1 include 7-nitroindole-2-carboxylic acid (NCA) and <b>lucanthone.</b> Both {{of these}} {{structures}} possess rings attached to short chains, which appear {{similar to the}} deoxyribose sugar ring without a base attached and phosphodiester bond in DNA. Both also contain lots of H-bond acceptors which may interact with the H-bond donors in the active site of APE1, causing these inhibitors to stick in the active site and preventing the enzyme from catalyzing other reactions.|$|E
40|$|Addition of <b>lucanthone</b> (1 - 5 mug/ml) to {{cultures}} of Tetrahymena {{results in a}} preferential inhibition of the synthesis of ribosomal RNA. Transcriptional studies with isolated nucleoli from Tetrahymena demonstrate that the endogenous RNA polymerases of the r-chromatin (chromatin form of rDNA) do not recognize the normal termination and move into the spacer region distal to the terminator {{in the presence of}} <b>lucanthone.</b> This is shown by hybridization of the transcript synthesized {{in the presence of the}} drug to restriction fragments of rDNA. <b>Lucanthone</b> seems specific in its action on termination as it does not inhibit the elongation process on the chromatin. Among various DNA-binding drugs tested only <b>lucanthone</b> and proflavine are found to cause repression of the termination. The data obtained suggest that the reduced synthesis of rRNA in lucanthone-treated eukaryotic cells is due to lack of reinitiating RNA polymerases possibly caused by improper termination...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lucanthone</b> and {{hycanthone}} are thioxanthenone DNA intercalators {{used in the}} 1980 s as antitumor agents. <b>Lucanthone</b> is in Phase I clinical trial, whereas hycanthone {{was pulled}} out of Phase II trials. Their potential mechanism of action includes DNA intercalation, inhibition of nucleic acid biosyntheses, and inhibition of enzymes like topoisomerases and the dual function base excision repair enzyme apurinic endonuclease 1 (APE 1). <b>Lucanthone</b> inhibits the endonuclease activity of APE 1, without affecting its redox activity. Our goal was to decipher the precise mechanism of APE 1 inhibition as a prerequisite towards development of improved therapeutics that can counteract higher APE 1 activity often seen in tumors. The IC 50 values for inhibition of APE 1 incision of depurinated plasmid DNA by <b>lucanthone</b> and hycanthone were 5 mM and 80 nM, respectively.

40|$|Cellular stress {{induced by}} {{nutrient}} deprivation, hypoxia, {{and exposure to}} many chemotherapeutic agents activates an evolutionarily conserved cell survival pathway termed autophagy. This pathway enables cancer cells to undergo self-digestion to generate ATP and other essential biosynthetic molecules to temporarily avoid cell death. Therefore, disruption of autophagy may sensitize cancer cells to cell death and augment chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Chloroquine and its analog hydroxychloroquine are the only clinically relevant autophagy inhibitors. Because both of these agents induce ocular toxicity, novel inhibitors of autophagy with a better therapeutic index are needed. Here we demonstrate that the small molecule <b>lucanthone</b> inhibits autophagy, induces lysosomal membrane permeabilization, and possesses significantly more potent activity in breast cancer models compared with chloroquine. Exposure to <b>lucanthone</b> resulted in processing and recruitment of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC 3) to autophagosomes, but impaired autophagic degradation as revealed by transmission electron microscopy and the accumulation of p 62 /SQSTM 1. Microarray analysis, qRT-PCR, and immunoblotting determined that <b>lucanthone</b> stimulated a large induction in cathepsin D, which correlated with cell death. Accordingly, knockdown of cathepsin D reduced lucanthone-mediated apoptosis. Subsequent studies using p 53 +/+ and p 53 −/− HCT 116 cells established that <b>lucanthone</b> induced cathepsin D expression and reduced cancer cell viability independently of p 53 status. In addition, <b>lucanthone</b> enhanced the anticancer activity of the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat. Collectively, our results demonstrate that <b>lucanthone</b> is a novel autophagic inhibitor that induces apoptosis via cathepsin D accumulation and enhances vorinostat-mediated cell death in breast cancer models...|$|E

The IC 50 values for inhibition of APE 1 incision of depurinated plasmid DNA by <b>lucanthone</b> and hycanthone were 5 µM and 80 nM, respectively. The KD values (affinity constants) for APE 1, as determined by BIACORE binding studies, were 89 nM for lucanthone/ 10 nM for hycanthone. APE 1 structures reveal a hydrophobic pocket where hydrophobic small molecules like thioxanthenones can bind, and our modeling studies confirmed such docking. Circular dichroism spectra uncovered change in the helical structure of APE 1 {{in the presence of}} lucanthone/hycanthone, and notably, this effect was decreased (Phe 266 Ala or Phe 266 Cys or Trp 280 Leu) or abolished (Phe 266 Ala/Trp 280 Ala) when hydrophobic site mutants were employed. Reduced inhibition by <b>lucanthone</b> of the diminished endonuclease activity of hydrophobic mutant proteins (as compared to wild type APE 1) supports that binding of <b>lucanthone</b> to the hydrophobic pocket dictates APE 1 inhibition. The DNA binding capacity of APE 1 was marginally inhibited by <b>lucanthone,</b> and not at all by hycanthone, supporting our hypothesis that thioxanthenones inhibit APE 1, predominantly, by direct interaction. Finally, lucanthone-induced degradation was drastically reduced in the presence of short and long lived free radical scavengers, e. g., TRIS and DMSO, suggesting that the mechanism of APE 1 breakdown may involve free radical-induced peptide bond cleavage...|$|E
40|$|Whole broth cultures, washed mycelia and non-germinating spores of 13 aspergilli scored {{from among}} 91 moulds {{isolated}} from soil and air transformed <b>lucanthone</b> (I) into {{three to five}} products with increased polarity. Biotransformations brought about by actively growing cultures were also performed by washed mycelia and non-germinating spores of the same strains. <b>Lucanthone</b> (I) was oxidized by growing cultures, washed mycelia and spore suspensions of an Aspergillus species (no. 2) into: hycanthone (11) as the main product, its aldehyde analogue (111) and its carboxylic acid derivative (IV). The pathway of <b>lucanthone</b> (I) oxidation by this strain involved hydroxylation of the 4 -methyl group (to give hycanthone, 11) followed by dehydrogenation of the resulting primary alcohol (to give the aldehyde, 111). The aldehyde 111 was finally slowly oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acid analogue IV. Evidence is presented to show that mycelial and spore enzymes effecting these oxidative reactions are intracellular and non-inducible in nature. Spore-mediated transformations were found not to require a source of energy and could be conducted in distilled water {{over a wide range}} of incubation temperature (from 4 to 37 "C). Use of the spores in successive transformations did not affect <b>lucanthone</b> (I) hydroxylation into hycanthone (11) or the dehydrogenation of the latter into the aldehyde analogue (111) but the ability of the spores to oxidize the aldehyde (111) to the carboxylic acid (IV) was lost...|$|E

The author stresses the importance of obtaining a high concentration of <b>lucanthone</b> in the body fluids. He suggests that better results might be obtained if the total dose were given in two days or even as a single, massive dose. This method might also reduce the side effects, which do not appear, as a rule, until the second or third day...|$|E
40|$|The {{induction}} of viral enzymes, {{the synthesis}} of DNA, {{and the production of}} progeny phage during infection of by bacteriophage PBS 2 are all unaffected by the presence of rifampicin. Rifampicin, rifamycin SV, streptovaricin, and streptolydigin (all of which inhibit. RNA synthesis by binding to DNA-dependent RNA polymerase) have no effect on PBS 2 infection. However, actinomycin D and <b>Lucanthone</b> (which inhibit DNA-dependent RNA synthesis by binding to DNA) both prevent PBS 2 replication. Therefore, PBS 2 phage may utilize a rifampicin-resistant RNA polymerase to transcribe its uracil-containing DNA during phage infection...|$|E

40|$|Several N-(ω-p-aminophenoxyalkyl) amides {{were active}} against Schistosoma mansoni in mice. One {{of the most}} effective, N-(5 -p-aminophenoxypentyl) benzamide (M&B 3002), acted more rapidly than <b>lucanthone</b> on adult worms but less rapidly than {{antimony}} potassium tartrate. It was inactive against immature worms. This compound and M&B 2948 A (N-(5 -p-aminophenoxypentyl) phthalimide) were both active against S. mansoni in hamsters. In monkeys M&B 2948 A was inactive, whilst M&B 3002 was not tested for therapeutic activity. Several of the compounds were examined {{for the production of}} visual impairment in cats. Although this property was not entirely absent, its incidence was very much lower in this amide series than among other ω-p-aminophenoxyalkyl derivatives not containing an amide group. M&B 3002 and M&B 2948 A produced impairment of vision in only a small proportion of the large number of cats tested. The general toxicology of the two drugs was studied in several species, and also their absorption and excretion in mice and rats; this was to provide information for a clinical trial...|$|E
40|$|Pretreatment {{of human}} leukemia THP- 1 cells with {{heat shock protein}} Hsp 70 (Hsp 70) {{protected}} them from the cell-lethal effects of the topoisomerase II inhibitor, <b>lucanthone</b> and from ionizing radiation. Cell viability was scored in clonogenic assays of single cells grown in liquid medium containing 0. 5 % methyl cellulose. Colonies were observed and rapidly scored after staining with the tetrazolium salt, 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide. The frequency of abasic sites in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of THP- 1 cells was reduced when these cells were treated with Hsp 70. Hsp 70 is presumed to have protected the cells by promoting repair of cell DNA, in agreement with previous studies that showed that Hsp 70 enhanced base excision repair by purified enzymes. The shoulders of radiation dose-response curves were enhanced by pretreatment of cells with Hsp 70 and, importantly, were reduced when cells were transfected with ribonucleic acid designed to silence Hsp 70.

Activation of autophagy may {{function as a}} tumor suppressor by degrading defective organelles and other cellular components. However, this pathway may also be exploited by cancer cells to generate nutrients and energy during periods of starvation, hypoxia, and stress induced by chemotherapy. Therefore, induction of autophagy {{has emerged as a}} drug resistance mechanism that promotes cancer cell survival via self-digestion. Numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy enhances the activity of a broad array of anticancer agents. Thus, targeting autophagy may be a global anticancer strategy that may improve the efficacy of many standard of care agents. These results have led to multiple clinical trials to evaluate autophagy inhibition in combination with conventional chemotherapy. In this review, we summarize the anticancer agents that have been reported to modulate autophagy and discuss new developments in autophagy inhibition as an anticancer strategy.

40|$|Hycanthone methanesulfonate (HCT) {{was shown}} to induce "forward" and "reverse" {{mutations}} in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Mutational effects of HCT on S. tyhhimurium TA 1532 were concentration and time dependent. A comparison of mutagenic potency for TA 1532 was made between HCT and the frame-shift mutagens quinacrine and ICR- 191. An investigation of structure-activity relationships revealed the substituent in the 4 -position of ring A to be critical for mutagenicity. Activity was found when this group was a hydroxymethyl (i. e., HCT) or an aldehyde (Win 25, 315), but the analogues having a carboxyl group (Win 25, 850) or methyl group (<b>lucanthone)</b> in this positionwere inactive. Removal of a single ethyl group from the side chain did not affect mutagenic activity inasmuch as the potency of desethyl HCT (Win 27, 262) equaled that of HCT on a molar basis. A marginal activity was found {{with a sample of}} HCT sulfoxide (win 27, 266), but this sample was found to contain traces of HCT.

40|$|Since {{radiation}} therapy remains a primary treatment modality for gliomas, the radioresistance of glioma cells and targets {{to modify their}} radiation tolerance are of significant interest. Human apurinic endonuclease 1 (Ape 1, Ref- 1, APEX, HAP 1, AP endo) is a multifunctional protein involved in base exci-sion repair of DNA and a redox-dependent transcriptional co-activator. This study investigated {{whether there is a}} direct relationship between Ape 1 and radioresistance in glioma cells, employing the human U 87 and U 251 cell lines. U 87 is intrinsically more radioresistant than U 251, which is partly attributable to more cycling U 251 cells found in G 2 /M, the most radiosensitive cell stage, while more U 87 cells are found in S and G 1, the more radioresistant cell stages. But observed radioresistance is also related to Ape 1 activity. U 87 has higher levels of Ape 1 than does U 251, as assessed by Western blot and enzyme activity assays (~ 1. 5 – 2 fold higher in cycling cells, and ~ 10 fold higher at G 2 /M). A direct relationship was seen in cells transfected with CMV-Ape 1 constructs; there was a dose-dependent relationship between increas-ing Ape 1 overexpression and increasing radioresistance. Conversely, knock down by siRNA or by phar-macological down regulation of Ape 1 resulted in decreased radioresistance. The inhibitors <b>lucanthone</b> and CRT 004876 were employed, the former a thioxanthene previously under clinical evaluation as a radiosen-sitizer for brain tumors and the latter a more specific Ape 1 inhibitor. These data suggest that Ape 1 may be a useful target for modifying radiation tolerance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Each of two Desert Sheep was {{infected}} with 1500 cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni of Northern Sudan. Signs of infection were anorexia, soft faeces, progressive weakness {{and loss of}} wool. The sheep were killed 254 and 269 days after infection. The findings were heavy infiltration of the lamina propria with inflammatory cells, numerous ova in the submucosa, hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue, oedema of the mesenteric lymph nodes, and focal pulmonary oedema and congestion. There were egg granulomas, focal necrosis, schistosomal pigment, fatty change, depletion of glycogen and reduction in the activity of adenosine triphosphatase, succinic tetrazolium reductase and glucose- 6 -phos-phatase in the liver. In one sheep I 330 cercariae penetrated and 700 matured to produce males and females in a 5 : 2 ratio. In the other sheep, about {{one third of the}} cercariae penetrated and matured. The ratio of males to females was 3 : 1. Studies of albino mice infected with a Sudan strain of Schistosoma mansoni showed that the infection caused severe liver damage and could be treated successfully with <b>lucanthone</b> hydrochloride. The studies also show that the degree of infection and pathogenicity of S. mansoni of Southern Sudan was greater than those of the North [4 - 61. Nubian goats are susceptible to infection with S. mansoni of Northern Sudan and develop diarrhoea accompanied by gradual deterioration of health, nervous signs and lesions in the alimentary tract, liver and lung [2]. There are no other studies on the effects of experimentally infected domestic animals with the Sudan strain of S. mansoni. This paper suggests the possibility of Sudanese Desert Sheep as hosts of S. mansoni, thus spreading infection in rural areas where there are contacts between man and animal...|$|E
40|$|Schistosomiasis, a {{grave and}} {{debilitating}} disease of socioeconomic importance, is increasing in incidence despite concerted {{efforts to control}} and contain the disease in all the endemic areas. While a multipronged method of control using health education, sanitation and snail control has been used, chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis play {{the most important and}} crucial role in containing/preventing the transmission of the disease. Schistosomicides such as antimonials were introduced, as early as the 1990 s as the drugs of choice and continued to be used until the early 1960 s. The antimonials were administered intravenously, and produced severe side effects; the various variables that determined their effects at the site of action made their application difficult and adversely affected their use in large scale chemotherapy. The antimonials were then replaced by hycanthone and <b>lucanthone</b> which were administered intramuscularly. These drugs produced immediate side effects such as hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal disturbances, and were consequently withdrawn. It was then decided that the alternative was to produce synthetic drugs that could be administered orally. Niridazole, oxamniquine, and metrifonate were introduced as schistosomicidal agents, with drugs like oltipraz and amoscanate still at clinical trial phase. Therapeutic doses of drugs like hycanthone, niridazole and amoscanate have been found to cause many major side effects. A significant advance in the control of schistosomiasis chemotherapy is the introduction of a relatively safe, effective, broad spectrum oral helminthic agent, praziquantel. Studies have also shown that oxamniquine is as effective as praziquantel in eliminating intestinal S. mansoni infection, and metrifonate is as effective as praziquantel in eliminating urinary S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections. Praziquantel {{has been found to be}} effective in treating S. haematobium infections compared with metrifonate and more effective in treating S. mansoni infection when compared with oxamniquine. Because the drug is effective even when treating advanced hepatosplenic schistosomiasis, with few side effects, praziquantel is currently the drug of choice for the treatment of any kind of schistosomiasis. The only limitation is the cost which restricts its use in many developing countries. While effective, safe drugs for mass chemotherapy are being developed, the problem of therapeutic failure and drug resistance is being reported from certain developing countries. Under these circumstances, alternative drugs must be resorted to. Mass treatment, a crucial goal in the eventual control of schistosomiasis, awaits a well-tolerated and nontoxic drug that will ultimately prove to be effective where cure is definite. Until such a time, while eradication of the disease is a near impossibility, reducing the intensity of infection can ultimately reduce morbidity and even mortality.
