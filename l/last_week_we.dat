But after that, I think we're looking to do some shows {{starting}} in March. Maybe local around here, maybe even some Mardi Gras gigs. But yeah, <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>we</b> sat around and they played me some new stuff they're working on, and it sounds good. Sounds like it's got a lot of promise, and really they just need me in the fuckin' practice room. So all {{this is going to happen}} this year. It has to happen. I know there's a responsibility here. Down has a fanbase and they are very very very loyal. So I don't want to let those people down. They deserve some new music, we have it. We've demoed other songs, there's songs that haven't even been released that people have never heard, so there's always Down there. For all you people out there, don't you stress. We got the Down coming." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Immortality" [...] was {{watched by}} about 3.7 million viewers, drawing a 1.4/4 ratings share on its initial broadcast, down 12.5 {{percent from the}} {{previous}} episode's viewership. During the first half hour, the episode placed second in its timeslot, but dropped to fourth for its second half. Its lead-in, Kitchen Nightmares, also dropped 12 percent, as did all other network shows for that night. Time shifting viewing added 57 percent to the episode's ratings for three days out, and 64 percent for a week following the first airing. This was the greatest DVR gain yet for the series in that timeslot. Despite this, Joshua Jackson urged fans to watch the series live {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly a week after [...] "Immortality" [...] aired. He explained [...] "I'm a positive person in general, but we really need our Fringe fans to tune in and watch us on Fridays. We did good when we first moved, but <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>we</b> did not have a good week, ratings wise. It is going to take the people that like the show to watch the show and start the campaign and show their support if they want to see us stick around for another season." ...|$|E
500|$|Television critics {{reacted with}} mixed {{reaction}} toward the episode, with one critic calling the storyline [...] "pretty dull." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of American Dad!, The Simpsons and Bob's Burgers that preceded the show, and the episode of The Cleveland Show that followed it, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I don't {{have much to say}} about tonight's Family Guy. <b>Last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>we</b> had some comments about how Family Guy seems to be willing to play with its format this season. That didn't happen this week at all." [...] Kaiser went on to criticize the flashback involving Lois and Joyce in high school, stating, [...] "Having a previously unknown flashback as the big reveal feels like cheating, if you're inclined to view Family Guy as consistent." [...] He concluded his review by praising [...] "the burning bush" [...] joke, and ultimately gave the episode a C- rating, the worst rating of the night. It was beaten by the American Dad! episode [...] "Fart-Break Hotel", The Cleveland Show episode [...] "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Roberta?", The Simpsons episode [...] "Flaming Moe", and the Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Crawl Space". In a slightly more positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode for some of its [...] "silly side jokes," [...] but felt disappointed by the ending to the show, commenting, [...] "it didn't follow any real logic [...] It was an easy way out, as if they'd written themselves into a corner." [...] Hughes also criticized the episode for its dependence on cutaway gags, writing, [...] "at least there were some funnier moments in this one. Unfortunately, a lot of those came in the cutaways. And I thought we were starting to move away from a dependence on them." [...] Hughes went on to comment that he felt confused by Stewie possibly being fathered by a porn star, adding that [...] "it would be far more likely that Chris or Meg was fathered by the porn star." ...|$|E

2500|$|Long {{considered}} [...] "married to his job", Boucher {{announced his}} engagement at age 59 to Amy Hauslohner, {{an editor of}} the Galax Gazette in Galax, Virginia. Said Boucher of the engagement [...] "We have decided since I will be 60 in August and she just turned 50 <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>we</b> probably are mature enough to handle marriage." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2015 Wheaton College {{suspended}} tenured {{professor of}} political science Larycia Hawkins, who wore hijab in solidarity with Muslims and wrote [...] "I stand in religious solidarity with Muslims because they, like me, a Christian, are people of the book. And as Pope Francis stated <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>we</b> worship the same God". In explaining the decision to place Dr. Hawkins on administrative leave the college referred to “significant questions regarding the theological implications” of her comments. The two officially parted ways in February 2016.|$|E

40|$|The present {{debate on}} the new {{definition}} has an advocacy taste on top of its scientific interest. Looking at the media messages reported worldwide over the <b>last</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>we</b> realized that the terms TDR tuberculosis and XXDR tuberculosis were used to generate interest in the average news reader—as well as probably anxiety or panic. The tuberculosis control community needs clear definitions, which reflect clinical and operational facts and support the laboratory, clinical, and public health efforts to prevent the emergence of drug resistance and to cure the resistant cases we have already produced...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not often enough," [...] she declared. [...] "I {{just love}} getting about. <b>Last</b> <b>week</b> <b>we</b> had a {{perfectly}} horrible trip, though. We started off for Belfast quite unexpectedly, and I hated {{every minute of}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What, you're Wigsby's nephew, are you?" [...] {{said the}} peer. [...] "I beg your pardon, we always call him Wigsby." [...] Pen blushed {{to hear his}} venerable uncle called by such a {{familiar}} name. [...] "We balloted you in <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> didn't <b>we?</b> Yes, <b>last</b> Wednesday night. Your uncle wasn't there." ...|$|R

I dare say it's {{only a few}} fags. Your house is so beastly slack, though." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kennedy {{verbally}} condenses {{human history}} to fifty years, in which “only <b>last</b> <b>week</b> did <b>we</b> develop penicillin and television and nuclear power, and now if America's new spacecraft succeeds in reaching Venus, {{we will have}} literally reached the stars before midnight tonight.” [...] With this extended metaphor, Kennedy sought to imbue {{a sense of urgency}} and change in his audience.|$|R
60|$|During the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>we</b> {{have had}} three stoves put up, and {{henceforth}} no {{light of a}} cheerful fire will gladden us at eventide. Stoves are detestable in every respect, except that they keep us perfectly comfortable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] said he, [...] "we only {{touched upon}} {{a few points}} <b>last</b> <b>week.</b> <b>We</b> ought to thrash it out. Various aspects of the matter have {{occurred}} to me which I ought to call to your attention." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I entirely {{disagree}} with you," [...] said the Chief Lady Guest, speaking very severely.

6000|$|... "People {{are getting}} to be so luxurious that one can't live up to them at all," [...] said Mrs. Toogood.

"That is {{more than}} I can tell you, miss, for, though some eight or ten of us have done little else than try to {{discover}} his name for the <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>we</b> have not got even {{as far as that}} one fact.

[...] "You must have known about the flirtation; if you haven't, you're the only one." [...] His vanity in the fact betrayed itself in his voice. [...] "It came to a crisis <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> and <b>we</b> tried to make each other believe {{that we were in}} earnest. But there won't be any real love lost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We have a {{beautiful}} garden," [...] said Jessie: [...] "papa is very particular about it, and we always get the prize for our flowers. We had the first prizes for hyacinths and forced roses <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> and <b>we</b> should have had the first for forced cucumbers if the gardener at Belforest {{had not had a}} spite against Spencer, because he left him for us.

6000|$|... "We shall march all {{the better}} for it to-morrow, O'Grady. It has been hard work, certainly, but not harder than it was marching down to Cork; {{and we should have}} a good many stragglers to-morrow {{if it had not been}} for the <b>last</b> <b>week's</b> work. <b>We</b> have got half a dozen footsore men in my company alone, and you would have fifty to-morrow night if the men had not had all this marching to get them fit." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{have been}} up to the Diego Ramirez Rocks twice {{in the past ten}} days. At the present moment, by vague dead reckoning, we are two hundred miles east of them. We have been hove down to our hatches three times in the <b>last</b> <b>week.</b> <b>We</b> have had six stout sails, of the {{heaviest}} canvas, furled and double-gasketed, torn loose and stripped from the yards. Sometimes, so weak are our men, not {{more than half of them}} can respond to the call for all hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite fresh enough, Mister Edgar, but the {{pressure}} when we go deep--say ten or fifteen fathoms--is severe on a man if long continued, so that he needs a little relief now and then. Some need more and some less relief, accordin' to their strength. Maxwell has only gone down fifteen feet, so that he wouldn't {{need to come up}} at all durin' a spell of work. We're goin' to blast a big rock that has bin' troublesome to us at low water. The hole was driven in it <b>last</b> <b>week.</b> <b>We</b> moored a raft over it and kep' men at work with a long iron jumper that reached from the rock {{to the surface of the}} sea. It was finished last night, and now he's gone to fix the charge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Spugg," [...] said a quiet looking, neatly dressed {{man whom}} I {{knew to be}} the {{president}} of an insurance company and who reached out and shook the speaker by the hand, [...] "this is a fine thing you're doing, a big thing. But we mustn't let you do it alone. Let our company take a hand in it. We're making a special rate now on chauffeurs, footmen, and house-servants sent to the war, quite below the rate that actuarial figures justify. It is our little war contribution," [...] he added modestly. [...] "We like to feel that we're doing our bit, too. We had a chauffeur killed <b>last</b> <b>week.</b> <b>We</b> paid for him right off without demur,--waived all question of who killed him. I never signed a check (as I took occasion to say in a little note I wrote to his people) with greater pleasure." ...|$|E
500|$|On 23 August 2014, it was {{reported}} that Delhi Dynamos, an Indian side that was set to play in the inaugural Indian Super League season, was in talks with Del Piero.

5000|$|After Sepp Blatter's sudden {{departure}} at Fifa on 2 June 2015, when Blatter {{claimed he}} was resigning for honourable reasons and to allow Fifa to move on, Dyke said," [...] I don't believe a word of this. If he believes that, why not step down <b>last</b> <b>week</b> when <b>we</b> asked him to? He was cock-a-hoop {{when he won the}} election and terribly arrogant. Clearly there is a smoking gun. This is nothing to do with Mr Blatter being honourable; he hasn't been honourable for years".|$|R
5000|$|Diana Steenbergen from IGN {{rated the}} episode with 8.5/10 saying: [...] "The twist ending this episode is {{completely}} unexpected {{as we learn}} that the two storylines of Mason looking for the moonstone and Katherine returning to Mystic Falls are connected. There was a hint of this <b>last</b> <b>week</b> when <b>we</b> saw Katherine in a flashback with the moonstone, but the revelation that she is pulling the strings on Mason is a surprise, and a good one. Devious as she is, we {{see that she was}} even the reason behind him becoming a werewolf." ...|$|R
