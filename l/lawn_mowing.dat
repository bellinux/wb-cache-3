He'd made some token appearances in the past—most notably in season one's 'Call of the Simpsons'—but 'Dead Putting Society' much more clearly defined the Ned we'd come to know and love. It also featured scads of good little bits and gags and seemed like a solid program." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, commented that apart from [...] "the memorable <b>lawn</b> <b>mowing</b> sequence at the end, this episode is notable for our first viewing of the gaudy, gadget-filled, God-fearing splendour that is the Flanderses' home." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2013 the Chicago Department of Aviation {{appropriated}} a $19,500 {{two-year contract}} to use livestock, specifically goats, sheep, llamas, and burros, for grounds maintenance. This plan resulted from difficulties in reaching certain {{areas around the}} runways with traditional <b>lawn</b> <b>mowing</b> machines due to rocky or sloped terrain. About 25 animals were recruited chiefly to clear growing vegetation around the approximately [...] space around the runways. A secondary reason for {{the introduction of the}} animals, especially the llamas and burros, was to reduce interference from wildlife such as coyotes and birds that may come when smaller prey settle in unmaintained, grassy areas.|$|E

When he was 16, he drove almost [...] to help a flight instructor whose airplane {{had been forced to}} make an emergency landing. Conrad repaired the plane single-handedly.

40|$|To analyse {{the effects}} of reduced green space {{management}} in urban areas on the biodiversity of insects, we compared intensely <b>mowed</b> <b>lawns</b> (<b>mowed</b> 12 times per year) with meadows under reduced maintenance (mowed only twice per year) {{in the city of}} Tübingen (Baden-Württemberg, Germany). Over the entire field season, 177 wild bee individuals representing 43 species were caught using sweep nets. Areas with reduced maintenance showed significantly higher total species numbers and biodiversity indices. Our research supports the initiative "Bunte Wiese (Colourful Meadow) - Species Diversity in Public Greenspaces" of the University of Tübingen, which is campaigning for the enhancement of species diversity in public urban greenland areas by reorganising intensive mowing into a "twice a year" programme...|$|R

50|$|In {{tapestry}} <b>lawns</b> <b>mowing</b> {{not only}} operates {{to maintain a}} low lawn-like aspect but it also repeatedly modulates the light environment and intentionally creates physical stress. The relatively taller plant species used gradually take {{more and more of}} the light as they grow, creating internal shade within the lawn and stressing the lower growing plants. When mowing is applied it removes the tall growth. This allows light to reach the light starved low growing plants and stresses the tall plants by reducing their size and photosynthetic area. The tall plants stop growing and use reserves of carbohydrates to repair the damage. Once the damage has been repaired, they begin to regrow from a reduced size plant. The low growing plants take advantage of the post-mowing window of opportunity to access light. In this way both low growing prostrate plants and the somewhat taller plants can be grown together.|$|R

The parents contact Detective Candy Bliss who pops in to offer wise, albeit often cryptic and conflicting, advice to Beth. It is learned that at the reunion in Chicago, the celebrity alumna Cecil Lockhart kidnapped Ben, renamed him Sam, and raised him as her own child until she was committed to a mental hospital, leaving Sam to be raised in a house only two blocks from the Cappadoras, by his adoptive father, the sensitive and intellectual George Karras.|$|R

40|$|Within-population genetic {{diversity}} influences many ecological processes, but {{few studies have}} examined how environmental conditions may impact these short-term diversity effects. Over four growing seasons, we followed experimental populations of a clonal, ubiquitous weed, Taraxacum officinale, with different numbers of genotypes in relatively favorable fallow field and unfavorable <b>mowed</b> <b>lawn</b> environmental treatments. Population performance (measured as total leaf area, seed production or biomass) clearly and consistently increased with diversity, and this effect became stronger {{over the course of the}} experiment. Diversity effects were stronger, and with different underlying mechanisms, in the fallow field versus the <b>mowed</b> <b>lawn.</b> Large genotypes dominated in the fallow field driving overyielding (via positive selection effects), whereas in the <b>mowed</b> <b>lawn,</b> where performance was limited by regular disturbance, there was evidence for complementarity among genotypes (with one compact genotype in particular performing better in mixture than monoculture). Hence, we predict stronger genotypic diversity effects in environments where intense intraspecific competition enhances genotypic differences. Our four-year field experiment plus seedling establishment trials indicate that genotypic diversity effects have far-reaching and context-dependent consequences across generations...|$|R
