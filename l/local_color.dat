Thirteen episodes were initially ordered, and were completed by April 2001, so that production would not be halted by a potential strike from the Writers Guild of America. Balcer was the show runner, executive producer and head writer on the first season of Law & Order: Criminal Intent. Wolf was also credited as an executive producer, as with all other Law & Order series. The first season gave co-executive producers credits to Peter Jankowski, Fred Berner, Geoffrey Neigher, and Arthur W. Forney. John L. Roman, Roz Weinman, and Eric Overmyer were named producers, with Michael Kewley a co-producer. Theresa Rebeck and Marlane Meyer were consulting producers. Twelve people directed, and nine people wrote the twenty-two episodes; Constantine Makris directed four episodes, and Balcer wrote or co-wrote ten episodes.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow loris has dark rings {{around its}} large eyes, a white nose with a whitish strip that {{extends to the}} {{forehead}} and a dark stripe that stretches {{from the back of}} the head along the spine. Its soft, thick, woolly fur ranges from light brown to deep reddish brown, with a lighter underside. The species is distinct from the Bengal slow loris due to the dark inverse teardrop markings around the eyes which meet the dark dorsal stripe on the back of the head. It tends to have a much more distinct white stripe between the eyes, more distinct dark coloring around the eyes, and a browner coat than the Bengal slow loris which is larger, grayer, and shows less contrast. The Sunda slow loris has less white facial coloring than the much smaller pygmy slow loris. <b>Local</b> <b>color</b> variations are known to occur.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA <b>local</b> <b>coloring</b> of a graph G is a {{function}} c:V(G) →N having the property that for each set S⊆V(G) with 2 ≤|S|≤ 3, there exist vertices u,v∈S such that |c(u) −c(v) |≥mS, where mS {{is the number of}} edges of the induced subgraph 〈S〉. The maximum color assigned by a <b>local</b> <b>coloring</b> c to a vertex of G is called the value of c and is denoted by χℓ(c). The local chromatic number of G is χℓ(G) =min{χℓ(c) }, where the minimum is taken over all local colorings c of G. The <b>local</b> <b>coloring</b> of graphs was introduced by Chartrand et al. [G.

40|$|AbstractFor a set A let [A]k {{denote the}} family of all k-element subsets of A.

In the paper we find the smallest cardinal γ such that there exists a <b>local</b> <b>coloring</b> of [A]k containing no colorful flower of size γ. As a consequence we answer a question raised by Pelant, Holický and Kalenda. We also discuss a few results and conjectures concerning a generalization of this problem...|$|R

500|$|The {{landscape}} {{paintings of}} Dutch painter Johan Barthold Jongkind (18191891) influenced both Boudin and Monet {{and contributed to}} the development of early Impressionism. After meeting Jongkind in Sainte-Adresse in 1862, Monet began to cultivate an interest in Jongkind's perspective on the changing conditions of the landscape. From Jongkind, Monet learned to substitute optical color for <b>local</b> <b>color.</b> [...] "Complementing the teaching I received from Boudin, Jongkind was from that moment my true master," [...] Monet later reminisced. [...] "It was he who completed the education of my eye". This new way of seeing, a shift from a conceptual to a perceptual approach, formed the basis for Monet's Haystacks (1890-1891), a series of 25 works showing the effects of dynamic atmospheric conditions over time on a single haystack motif.|$|E

500|$|Adding <b>local</b> <b>color</b> to the Klingon {{bridge was}} a ragged doglike {{creature}} the effects team derisively called [...] "Fifi Rebozo". Ken Ralston thought that giving the Klingon captain a pet would add atmosphere, and sculpted a reptilian dog worked into the script as Kruge's mascot. The animal's hair {{was made from}} cheap wig clippings; creature supervisor David Sosalla sprayed the material with adhesive and laid clumps of the distressed fur onto the painted puppet body to make the animal appear [...] "beat-up and moth-eaten". During filming, Sosalla and crew sprinkled the creature with water {{to make it look}} more unpleasant. The animal was a hand puppet; Ralston operated the head and body by placing his arm into an opening on the creature's side while hidden inside Kruge's command chair. Three helpers operated cables that opened the animal's eyes and made it snarl; the creature's head was large enough for Ralston to fit his hand inside the spring-loaded jaw to operate it. Many of the animal's intended movements were minimized; the crew did not move its ears because it made the supposedly repulsive creature [...] "cute". For the animal's demise during the Klingons' fight with the Enterprise, an additional [...] "dead" [...] puppet was created, but Ralston used the [...] "live" [...] one for the scene instead.|$|E
