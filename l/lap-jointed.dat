50|$|The {{boiler barrel}} was {{built up in}} three rings, {{arranged}} telescopically, with the smallest diameter at the firebox end. The rings were <b>lap-jointed</b> and double riveted on longitudinal seams. These boilers had a long life and required little expense in repairs. Five cross-stays were fitted in the steam space above the firebox. The safety valves were arranged above the firebox inside the cab, while a steam escape pipe was fitted above the valves and passed through the roof.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} is to predict the dynamic {{behaviour}} of single <b>lap-jointed</b> cantilevered beams theoretically and to validate the predictions via experimental tests. The ABAQUS finite element analysis (FEA) software was used to predict the natural frequencies, mode shapes and frequency response functions (FRFs) of <b>lap-jointed</b> beams. The LMS (Leuven Measurement System) CADA-X dynamic test software and the LMS-DIFA Scadas II 48 channel data acquisition hardware were used in experimental measurement of the dynamic response of the <b>lap-jointed</b> beams. It is shown that the natural frequencies of the single <b>lap-jointed</b> cantilevered beams from experiment are lower than those predicted using FEA. It is also found that the measued FRFs are close to the predicted FRFs for the first two modes of vibration of the single <b>lap-jointed</b> cantilevered beam. Above the second mode of vibration, there is considerable discrepancy between the measured and predicted FRFs...|$|E
40|$|Self-piercing {{riveting}} (SPR) {{has drawn}} more attention {{in recent years}} because it can join some advanced materials {{that are hard to}} weld, such as aluminum alloy sheets. In this paper, the free torsional vibration characteristics of single. <b>lap-jointed</b> encastre SPR beam are investigated in detail. The focus of the analysis is to reveal the influence on the torsional natural frequencies and mode shapes of the single <b>lap-jointed</b> encastre SPR beam of different characteristics of sheets to be jointed. Numerical examples show that the torsional natural frequencies increase significantly as the Young's modulus of the sheets increase, but almost no change corresponding to the change in Poisson's ratio of the sheets to be joint. The mode shapes show that there are different deformations in the jointed section of SPR beam compared with the reference encastre beam without joint. These different deformations may cause different natural frequency values and different stress distributions. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model {{to study the}} flexural vibration of a bonded lap joint system is described in this paper. First, equations of motion at the joint region are derived using a differential element approach. The transverse displacements of {{the upper and lower}} beam are considered to be different. The adhesive is assumed to be linearly viscoelastic and the widely used Kelvin-Voight model is used to represent the viscoelastic behavior of the adhesive. The shear force at the interface between the adhesive and the beam is obtained from the simple bending motion equations of the two beams. The resulting equations of motion are combined with the equations of transverse vibration of the beams in the unjointed regions. These are later solved as a boundary value problem to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system. The model can be used to predict the natural frequencies, modal damping ratios, and mode shapes of the system for free vibration. Good agreement between numerical and experimental results was obtained for a system of graphite epoxy beams <b>lap-jointed</b> by an epoxy adhesive...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Self-pierce {{riveting}} (SPR) is nowadays {{widely used}} in the car manufacturing industry where aluminium alloys are used for body construction. For the design of mechanical structures, formed by the joining of component parts, {{a knowledge of the}} vibration characteristics of different joint types (adhesive bonding, spot welding, SPR etc) is essential. The free transverse vibration characteristics of single <b>lap-jointed</b> encastre SPR beams are investigated theoretically in this paper using the three dimensional finite element method (FEM). Numerical examples are provided to show the influence on the natural frequencies, natural frequency ratios and mode shapes of these beams caused by variations in the material properties (E and υ) of the sheet material. It is shown that the transverse natural frequencies of single lap jointed encastre SPR beams increases significantly as the Young’s Modulus of the sheets increases, but only slight changes are encountered for variations of Poisson’s Ratio. It is found that an exponential curve gives an acceptable fit to the relationship between natural frequency and Young’s Modulus. As expected, odd modes shapes were found to be symmetrical about the mid-length position and even modes were anti-symmetrical...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} recent {{results on}} simulating full-scale pressure tests of wide body, <b>lap-jointed</b> fuselage panels with multiple site damage (MSD). The crack tip opening angle (CTOA) fracture criterion and the FRANC 3 D/STAGS software program {{were used to}} analyze stable crack growth under conditions of general yielding. The link-up of multiple cracks and residual strength of damaged structures were predicted. Elastic-plastic finite element analysis based on the von Mises yield criterion and incremental flow theory with small strain assumption was used. A global-local modeling procedure was employed in the numerical analyses. Stress distributions from the numerical simulations are compared with strain gage measurements. Analysis results show that accurate representation of the load transfer through the rivets is crucial for the model to predict the stress distribution accurately. Predicted crack growth and residual strength are compared with test data. Observed and predicted results both indicate that the occurrence of small MSD cracks substantially reduces the residual strength. Modeling fatigue closure is essential to capture the fracture behavior during the early stable crack growth. Breakage of a tear strap can have {{a major influence on}} residual strength prediction...|$|E

40|$|The damping {{capacity}} of graphite epoxy materials and structural joints was evaluated. The damping ratio of different composite specimens and bonded joints were systematically evaluated under normal atmospheric conditions {{and in a}} vacuum environment. Free and forced vibration test methods were employed for measuring the damping ratios. The effect of edge support conditions on the damping value of a composite tube specimen was studied by using a series of experiments performed on the specimen with different edge supports. It was found that simulating a free-free boundary conditions by having no constraints at the ends gives the lowest value of the material damping of the composite. The accuracy of the estimation of the damping ratio value was improved by using a curve-fitting technique on the response data obtained through measurement. The effect of outgassing (moisture desorption) on the {{damping capacity}} was determined by measuring the damping ratio of the tube specimen in a vacuum environment before and after outgassing had occurred. The effects {{of high and low}} temperatures on the damping was also investigated by using a series of experiments on tube and beam specimens. An analytical model to study the vibrations of a bonded lap joint system was formulated. Numerical results were generated for different overlap ratios of the system. These were compared with experimental results. In order to determine the influence of bonded joints on the material damping capacity, experiments were conducted on bonded <b>lap-jointed</b> and double-butt-jointed specimens. These experimental results were compared with simple beam specimens with no joints...|$|E

A new packaging method for microfluidic devices is proposed of polymer over-molding to form a fluidic manifold integrated with the device in a single step. The anticipated advantages of the proposed method of packaging are ease of assembly and low part count, making it suitable for low cost and high volume manufacturing. This paper reports the results of a preliminary investigation into this concept. Glass and silicon inserts of 25 times 20 mm in size, used to represent microfluidic devices, were over-molded in an injection molding process with a range of polymers. The inserts were found to survive the molding process intact. The adhesion between overmold and insert was investigated by subjecting the interface between the overmold and insert surface to a hydrostatic pressure of up to 100 lbf/in 2 (6. 9 bar). The durability of the interfacial adhesion to hydrolysis was investigated by immersion in water at 50 degC for 24 h before testing. Direct measurements of adhesion strength between polymer and glass were also attempted by tensile tests on <b>lap-jointed</b> samples. The best and most durable adhesion for glass and silicon inserts was found for polyamide (PA) 12, which is a low hygroscopicity PA. The ranking of polymers by their performances in the pressurization tests was consistent with the ranking by the calculated work-of-adhesion values for polymer/glass and polymer/silicon joints...|$|E
