However, Hamm regarded Don's fear as [...] "genuine" [...] when he is unsure of Megan's whereabouts. The flashback scene between Don and Megan in the car was actually shot for the fourth season finale, [...] "Tomorrowland", written and directed by Weiner, but was cut. Weiner decided to reinsert this scene into the episode as a flashback.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2013, guitarist John Petrucci {{began writing}} {{a story for}} a concept album, {{presenting}} it {{to the rest of}} Dream Theater about a year later. The band and the record label were receptive to the idea, with Petrucci recalling, [...] "Everybody had the 'go for it' mentality. And from the very first meeting that we had with Dave Rath at Roadrunner, when I presented this and even just said the title, he was 100 percent on board. The involvement of everybody at Roadrunner has been absolutely unbelievable, so supportive. It kind of ignited the secret nerd in all of us that <b>loves</b> <b>this</b> sort of stuff, because it's fun, it's different." [...] From its conception, Petrucci envisioned the story as eventually being re-worked into a film, play, or video game.|$|E

Gregory Adams of Exclaim! praised Alsina's [...] "velvety" [...] vocal {{delivery}} on the song. Brandon Soderberg from Spin called it [...] "one of the more mazy and rewarding radio R songs in quite some time", but was unimpressed with the Songz and Brown remix's shift from partying to sexual intercourse, particularly the rewriting of the hook as [...] "She <b>loves</b> <b>this</b> shit" [...] or [...] "You love this shit". A panel of writers for Complex placed [...] "I Luv This Shit" [...] at number thirty-three on its list of the 50 Best Songs of 2013; Claire Lobenfeld disapproved of James' verse but lauded the [...] "quivering beauty" [...] of Alsina's voice.

500|$|Just prior of {{the casting}} call and video shoot, Stansberry {{expressed}} his views to MTV News {{on the concept}} for the video – originality. [...] "Originality, being you. This song is about being who you want. It's about letting loose. There's no explanation. This is this underground video, this underground party." [...] During the video shoot, MTV interviewed Lopez about the concepts for the video. Lopez described some of the characters she played, telling MTV that in one scene [...] "I play one character where she kind of runs this party, acts like she's kind of over it, {{but at the same}} time loves it and <b>loves</b> <b>this</b> kind of underground kind of party dance culture,... So I got to be wild and crazy, and at the same time I got to be sexy and sweet too." [...] The video makes use of product placement, including BMW, Swarovski and Crown Royal, according to Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly. Stransky also noted the [...] "unintentional placement" [...] of fake eyelashes and wigs, weaves, and other hair-extending products.|$|E

The film {{includes}} the themes of bullying, youth crime, domestic violence, unwanted pregnancy, and teenage angst. For Blakeman, April's [...] "heartbreaking journey in searching for her real mum is also about being brave enough to let love in." [...] Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, spoke {{of the limits of}} taboo themes in family dramas, and said the film's [...] "account of a life lived in care couldn't have had swearing, or casual drug use, and when a shadow fell over a child's bed at night, it wasn't the care-home manager coming to exercise some horrible , as it might have been in an adult drama". The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer [...] "a unique take" [...] on the role. Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that [...] "At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she <b>loves</b> <b>this</b> girl. And that is an amazing liberation when you discover someone more important to you than you are. That is what is incredible about becoming a parent – you care about your child more than you care about yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|California Chrome {{shipped to}} New York on May 20 in a {{semi-trailer}} horse van together with Ride On Curlin. They had a police escort through New York City from the Throgs Neck Bridge to Belmont Park. The [...] press reported that Art Sherman believed the misspelled saddle cloths at the Derby and Preakness {{were a good}} luck charm, and that he specifically asked Belmont Park for another misspelled cloth along with a properly spelled version. The first week California Chrome spent at the Belmont track was generally uneventful, other than galloping past an opossum that wandered onto the track the morning of May 23. The horse {{paid little attention to}} it, but the press pounced on the story; the animal was labeled [...] "Dumb-Ass Possum", and someone created a Twitter account for the creature. Delgado commented, [...] "I can tell you he <b>loves</b> <b>this</b> track, and I don't see him (having) any problem getting a mile and a half." [...] On May 31, Espinoza arrived to give the colt a short workout known as a [...] "breeze".

500|$|In the Los Angeles Times, Chris Willman {{wrote that}} Carey [...] "attempts {{her share of}} girl-group pop amid the quasi-gospel melisma, though still not evidencing as much {{personality}} as talent in either style". New York Times journalist Jon Pareles was more critical in his review. [...] "Regardless of backup, Ms. Carey oversings, glutting songs with her vocal tics—like sliding down from the note above the melody note—and turning expressions of devotion into narcissistic displays." [...] Chris Dickinson from the Chicago Tribune called the singer a [...] "trilling songbird" [...] and [...] "over-the-top irritant" [...] throughout the album, particularly on [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", where she [...] "sounds like a bush-league Petula Clark". The newspaper later named it the seventh worst Christmas album ever. J. D. Considine was more enthusiastic in The Baltimore Sun. In his opinion, Merry Christmas [...] "may look like just another attempt {{to cash in on}} Christmas cheer, but is actually the work of someone who genuinely <b>loves</b> <b>this</b> music". Considine said while Carey's gospel and soul-inflected vocal exercises worked well with the traditional songs, [...] "the album's real strength is the conviction she brings to otherwise corny fare like 'Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town', while the way she augments 'Joy to the World' with a bit of the Three Dog Night hit is pure genius." [...] Steve Morse from The Boston Globe argued that it was perhaps Carey's best record, on which she abandoned the overly polished sound of her previous albums and [...] "cut loose with unbridled soul".|$|E
2500|$|Foggerty's Fairy, subtitled [...] "An Entirely Original Fairy Farce", is a three-act farce by W.S.

The story concerns a man who, {{with the help of a}} fairy, changes a small event in his past to try to save his engagement to the girl he <b>loves.</b> <b>This</b> leads to profound changes in his present, and he finds that matters are even worse than before.|$|E

2500|$|For Mordecai Kaplan, {{the founder}} of Reconstructionist Judaism, God is not a person, but rather a force within the {{universe}} that is experienced; in fact, anytime something worthwhile is experienced, that is God. God {{is the sum of}} all natural processes that allow people to be self-fulfilling, the power that makes for salvation. Thus, Kaplan’s God is abstract, not carnate, and intangible. It is important to note that, in this model, God exists within this universe; for Kaplan, there is nothing supernatural or otherworldly. One <b>loves</b> <b>this</b> God by seeking out truth and goodness. Kaplan does not view God as a person but acknowledges that using personal God-language can help people feel connected to their heritage and can act as “an affirmation that life has value.” ...|$|E
