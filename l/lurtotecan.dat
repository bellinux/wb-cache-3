40|$|An {{additional}} chromatographic peak {{was observed}} in plasma samples of patients receiving NX 211, a liposomal formulation of the topoisomerase I inhibitor <b>lurtotecan.</b> We have isolated and purified this product by sequential solid-phase extractions, and we report its structure and cytotoxicity relative to <b>lurtotecan</b> and related agents. Nuclear magnetic resonance data indicate that cleavage of the piperazino moiety occurred at the N-C bond of the B-ring, yielding 7 -methyl- 10, 11 -ethylenedioxy- 20 (S) -camptothecin (MEC). Tests of the growth inhibition potential of MEC in seven human tumor cell lines showed that the compound was approximately 2 - 18 -fold more cytotoxic than <b>lurtotecan,</b> topotecan, and 7 -ethyl- 10 -hydroxy- 20 (S) -camptothecin (SN- 38). Subsequently, we found that MEC {{was the product of}} rapid photolysis of <b>lurtotecan,</b> with the rate of degradation inversely proportional to NX 211 concentrations, and greatly depends on light intensity. Furthermore, MEC concentrations were found to increase significantly in plasma samples exposed to laboratory light but not in blood. MEC was not produced from NX 211 in the presence of human liver microsomes, suggesting {{that it is not a}} product of cytochrome P- 450 metabolism. Using a validated analytical method, trace levels of MEC were quantitated in blood samples of two patients. These observations confirm that the precautions for protection from light currently specified for preparation and administration of NX 211 dose solutions are critical. Procedures to minimize formation of MEC, by the use of amber vials for NX 211 and by preparation of dilutions immediately before clinical use in a fashion completely protected from light, are now being routinely implemented...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the maximum-tolerated and recommended dose, toxicity profile, and pharmacokinetics of the liposomal topoisomerase 1 inhibitor <b>lurtotecan</b> (NX 211) administered as a 30 -minute intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks in cancer patients. Patients and Methods: NX 211 was administered by peripheral infusion. Dose escalation decisions {{were based on}} all toxicities during the first cycle as well as pharmacokinetic parameters. Serial plasma, whole blood, and urine samples were collected for up to 96 hours {{after the end of}} infusion, and drug levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: Twenty-nine patients (16 women; median age, 56 years; range, 39 to 74 years) received 77 courses of NX 211 at dose levels of 0. 4 (n = 3), 0. 8 (n = 6), 1. 6 (n = 3), 3. 2 (n = 6), 3. 8 (n = 6), and 4. 3 mg/m(2) (n = 5). Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were the dose-limiting toxicities and were not cumulative. Other toxicities were mild to moderate. Nine patients had stable disease while undergoing treatment. The systemic clearance of <b>lurtotecan</b> in plasma and whole blood was 0. 82 +/- 0. 78 L/h/m(2) and 1. 15 +/- 0. 96 L/h/ m(2), respectively. Urinary recovery (Fu) of <b>lurtotecan</b> was 10. 1 +/- 4. 05 % (range, 4. 9 % to 18. 9 %). In contrast to systemic exposure measures, the dose excreted in urine (ie, dose x Fu) was significantly related to the percent decrease in neutrophil and platelet counts at nadir (P <. 00001). Conclusion: The dose-limiting toxicities of NX 211 are neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The recommended dose for phase II studies is 3. 8 mg/m 2 once every 3 weeks. Pharmacologic data suggest a relationship between exposure to <b>lurtotecan</b> and NX 211 -induced clinical effects. (C) 2002 by American Society of Clinical Oncology...|$|E

40|$|Population pharmacokinetic-dynamic {{analysis}} was prospectively integrated {{in a broad}} phase II program of <b>lurtotecan</b> (GI 147211), a novel camptothecin derived topoisomerase I inhibitor, to determine the population pharmacokinetic profile in a larger population, to estimate individual pharmacokinetic parameters and to investigate relationships with clinical outcome. A sparse sampling method was applied during course one, which involved two sampling time-points. A Bayesian algorithm was used to estimate individual pharmacokinetic parameters, in particular total plasma clearance (CL) and volume of distribution. In total, samples were collected of 109 (63 %) of 173 patients. Pharmacokinetic-dynamic evaluation could be carried out successfully in 85 (78 %) of the sampled patients. CL of <b>lurtotecan</b> showed substantial variability (mean 87 +/- 28 L/h) and was of the same magnitude as in the phase I studies where full pharmacokinetic curves were used. Residual variability in the population estimate of CL was 9. 9 %. No significant relationships were observed between exposure parameters and toxicity nor likelihood of tumor response, however the latter relationship {{may well have been}} obscured by the heterogeneity of the studied population. Prospective implementation of large scale population pharmacokinetic-dynamic analysis is feasible and important to establish whether interpatient variability in drug exposure is a major determinant of toxicity or activity. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Pre-{{clinical}} {{and clinical}} phannacokinetics {{plays an important}} rote {{in the development of}} new anticancer agents and in the refinement of already existing therapies. In clinical studies, phannacokinetic parameters, including area under the plasma concentration-time curve and/or time above a certain threshold concentration, have previously been shown {{to be related to the}} phannacodynamic outcomes, such as myelosuppression or anti-tumor response. In order to obtain reliable phannacokinetic parameters, analytical methodologies have to be developed and validated, enabling accurate detennination of concentrations of anticancer dmgs in biological matrices. These methodologies have to be validated in terms of selectivity, precision, accuracy and sensitivity, to obtain meaningful phannacokinetic results. During the last decade several analogues of the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin have entered clinical practice. Topoisomerase I is a nuclear enzyme involved in the replication of DNA, by fonning a cleavable complex, i. e. the covalent interaction between DNA and the enzyme. The cleavable complex results in a single strand break of the DNA, resulting in relaxation, followed by replication and resealing of the break. The camptothecin topoisomerase I inhibitors reversibly stabilize the cleavable complex, resulting in single·strand DNA breaks and thus termination of DNA replication, subsequently followed by cell death. The camptothecin analogues share a pH-dependent reversible conversion between their pharmacologically active lactone form, which is able to diffuse across cell membranes, and their inactive ring·opened carboxylate form. The existence of the two forms of the camptothecin analogues requires quick sample handling at the site of the patient in order to acquire real·time pharmacokinetic data. In chapter 1, an overview of methodologies for the determination of camptothecin analogues is described and their applicability for pharmacokinetic analysis is discussed. In this thesis, methodologies for the quantitative determination of the topoisomerase I inhibitors topotecan, 9 -aminocamptothecin and <b>lurtotecan</b> are described. The applicability of these assays is shown in both clinical pharmacokinetic and in vitro studies...|$|E
