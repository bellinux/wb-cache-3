25|$|The {{capacity}} of a roundabout varies based on entry angle, <b>lane</b> <b>width,</b> {{and the number of}} entry and circulating lanes. As with other types of junctions, operational performance depends heavily on the flow volumes from various approaches. A single-lane roundabout can handle approximately 20,000–26,000 vehicles per day, while a two-lane design supports 40,000 to 50,000.|$|E

2500|$|The {{selection}} of <b>lane</b> <b>width</b> affects {{the cost and}} performance of a highway. Typical lane widths range from [...] to [...] Wider lanes and shoulders are usually used on roads with higher speed and higher volume traffic, and significant numbers of trucks and other large vehicles. Narrower lanes may be used on roads with lower speed or lower volume traffic.|$|E

5000|$|One {{advantage}} of barrier systems over other lane management treatments (i.e. traffic cones or overhead directional lights) {{is that a}} solid, positive barrier prevents vehicle collisions due to motorists crossing over into opposing traffic flow. [...] A disadvantage is that <b>lane</b> <b>widths</b> can be slightly reduced.|$|R
2500|$|CFI {{argues for}} a marked <b>lane</b> <b>width</b> of [...] On {{undivided}} roads, width provides cyclists with adequate clearance from passing HGVs while being narrow enough to deter drivers from [...] "doubling up" [...] to form two lanes. This [...] "doubling up" [...] effect {{may be related}} to junctions. At non-junction locations, greater width might be preferable if this effect can be avoided. The European Commission specifically endorses wide lanes in its policy document on cycling promotion, Cycling: the way ahead for towns and cities.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1960s the Grace Memorial Bridge {{had become}} insufficient, with its two narrow 10-foot (3 m) lanes built for Ford Model As and its steep grades {{of up to}} 6 percent. Later changes to the side rail and curb reduced the <b>lane</b> <b>width</b> further. A new bridge was {{constructed}} alongside and parallel to it. Named for the then-South Carolina Highway Commissioner, the Silas N. Pearman Bridge opened in 1966 at cost of $15 million. Its three lanes, at a modern 12-foot (3.7 m) width, opened to northbound traffic while its older counterpart carried the southbound traffic into downtown Charleston. One lane was reversible on the Pearman bridge, which led to signs warning [...] "Use lanes with green arrow" [...] and [...] "Do not use red X lane" [...] on the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|One {{method for}} {{reducing}} potential friction between cyclists and motorized vehicles {{is to provide}} [...] "wide kerb", or [...] "nearside", lanes (UK terminology) or [...] "wide outside through lane" [...] (U.S. terminology). These extra-wide lanes increase the probability that motorists pass cyclists {{at a safe distance}} without having to change lanes. This is held to be particularly important on routes with a high proportion of wide vehicles such as buses or heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). They also provide more room for cyclists to filter past queues of cars in congested conditions and to safely overtake each other. Due to the tendency of all vehicle users to stay in the center of their lane, it would be necessary to sub-divide the cycle lane with a broken white line to facilitate safe overtaking. Overtaking is indispensable for cyclists, as speeds are not dependent on the legal speed limit, but on the rider's capability.The use of such lanes is specifically endorsed by Cycling: the way ahead for towns and cities, the European Commission policy document on cycle promotion. The UK Cyclists Touring Club argues for a marked <b>lane</b> <b>width</b> of 4.25m (14ft). It is argued that, on undivided roads, this width provides cyclists with adequate clearance from passing wide vehicles while being sufficiently narrow to deter motorists from attempting to [...] "double up" [...] and form two lanes. This [...] "doubling up" [...] effect may be related to junctions. At non-junction locations, greater width might be preferable if this effect can be avoided.|$|E

5000|$|The bridge {{had been}} {{recently}} evaluated as safe {{and in good}} condition despite being 58 years old; it was not listed as structurally deficient. The bridge was classified as functionally obsolete, {{in this case because}} the bridge does not meet current design standards for <b>lane</b> <b>widths</b> and vertical clearance in new highway bridges. [...] The bridge was not a candidate for any significant upgrades or replacement and was well-maintained.|$|R

40|$|Semarang - Kendal Road {{section is}} a {{connector}} between {{the central city}} of Semarang and Kendal. Traffic flows and accident rates through this street is quite high, especially accidents involving motorcycles. For that, the solution is the implementation of motorcycle lanes. From the analysis results DS in Siliwangi Road Sections is 0, 75 and 0, 78 in Walisongo Roads with low average speed is 27, 58 km /h in Jalan Siliwangi. Analysis results obtained Siliwangi Road motorcycle accident is 70 % and 66 % on Walisongo Road. The proportion of motorcycle on Siliwangi road is 25. 25 % - 41. 66 % and 18. 86 % - 41. 43 % on Walisongo Road. Volume motorcycle in Siliwangi Road 1, 687 pcu/hour and Walisongo Road 1, 231 pcu/hour. Siliwangi Road DS is 0. 75 and 0. 78 on Walisongo Road. From solutions then selected by the best alternative with DS. Siliwangi road is divided into 4 segments, Segment I {{is to make the}} motorcycle <b>lane</b> with a <b>width</b> of 4 m and the other vehicle <b>lane</b> with a <b>width</b> of 8 m. Segment II is to make the motorcycle <b>lane</b> with a <b>width</b> of 4, 25 m and the other vehicle <b>lane</b> with a <b>width</b> of 9, 75 m. Segment III, this does not allow the roads to be made motorcycle lane because the road has a length of less than 100 m. Segment IV is to make the motorcycle <b>lane</b> with a <b>width</b> of 4 m and the other vehicle <b>lane</b> with a <b>width</b> of 7 m. In the Walisongo roads solution is to makes the motorcycle <b>lane</b> with a <b>width</b> of 4 m, and the other vehicle <b>lane</b> with a <b>width</b> of 7 m. Based on those motorcycle lanes parameters, can be concluded that the Semarang - Kendal Road section required motorcycle lanes with lane separators are markers...|$|R
50|$|A bicycle-only route {{intended}} for cycling longer distances for practical reasons such as commuting or for {{sport and exercise}} can either be called a snelfietsroute (fast bike route) or a fietssnelweg (cycle highway). Some characteristics of these cycling routes mentioned by governments (both national and local) and traffic experts are: bi-directional paths with recommended uni-directional <b>lane</b> <b>widths</b> of 2 metres and minimum widths of 1.5 metres; very level and straight stretches (i.e. few ups and downs, curves or turns); the absence of traffic lights and level crossings with motorised traffic; and superior pavement quality.|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{the quality}} of the Dukes Highway is of a high standard, with the entire road having wide <b>lane</b> <b>widths</b> and sealed {{shoulders}} with at least five (and usually six) metres clear beyond the edge line. The final 17 km of the highway after Bordertown, was originally built on unstable ground but was re-constructed in 2005. There are a total of 16 rest areas or parking bays along the Dukes Highway, at approximately 15km intervals. Each one provides sealed parking space for at least four B-double trucks, with bins, tables, shelter and lighting.|$|R
50|$|The widths {{of vehicle}} lanes {{typically}} vary from 9 to 15 ft. Lane widths are commonly narrower on low volume roads and wider on higher volume roads. The <b>lane</b> <b>width</b> {{depends on the}} assumed maximum vehicle width with an additional space to allow for lateral motion of the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Cyclists ideally have a {{protected}} bike lane on {{the approach to}} the intersection, separated by a concrete median with splay curbs if possible, and have {{a protected}} bike <b>lane</b> <b>width</b> of at least 2 metres if possible (one way). In the Netherlands, most one way cycle paths are at least 2.5 metres wide.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lane</b> <b>width</b> {{should be}} at least 3.5 m on {{straight}} sections of road. This guarantees adequate clearance for any vehicle having a superstructure of width 2.50 m which is the maximum specified width in Directive 2002/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council which recognize some specific tolerances for some specific countries.|$|E
50|$|In North America, {{and some}} other {{countries}} with large sparsely populated areas, opposing lanes of traffic may be separated by several hundred meters of fields or forests outside of heavily populated areas (an extreme example being the Trans-Canada Highway near Ernfold, Saskatchewan, Canada, where eastbound and westbound lanes {{go as far as}} 5 km apart from each other), but converge to a <b>lane's</b> <b>width</b> of separation in suburban areas and cities. In urban areas, concrete barriers (such as Jersey barriers) and guard rails (or guide rails) are used.|$|R
50|$|SR 95 {{begins at}} US 411 (SR 33), in Greenback, and goes {{northwest}} predominantly along Lenoir City Road. Curving through the Red Knobs, {{it passes through}} the communities of Centersville and Glendale, before reaching US 321 (SR 73). This section of SR 95 is two-lane throughout, with no shoulders and minimum allowable <b>lane</b> <b>widths.</b> The next 12.8 mi, SR 95 is a hidden overlap of US 321, as it traverses through Lenoir City, intersecting US 11 (SR 2), I-75, and then US 70 (SR 1) in that city.|$|R
50|$|X58 board {{manufacturers}} {{can build}} SLI-compatible Intel chipset boards by submitting their designs to nVidia for validation. However, users wishing to run {{more than two}} Nvidia video cards in PCIe ×16 will still need to purchase motherboards equipped {{with one or more}} nVidia nForce chipsets. It is still possible to run more than two video cards in an SLI-configuration at fewer PCIe <b>lane</b> <b>widths.</b> The X58 chipset itself supports up to 36 PCI-Express 2.0 lanes, so it is possible to have two PCIe ×16 slots and one PCIe ×4 slot on the same motherboard.|$|R
