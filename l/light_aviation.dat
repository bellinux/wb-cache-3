25|$|Portugal was {{the fifth}} nation to join the {{programme}} with an order for ten transport NH90 in June 2001; it was intended for these to equip the Portuguese Army <b>Light</b> <b>Aviation</b> Unit. However, in July 2012, fiscal consequences of the Great Recession led Portugal to cancel the order, despite having already spent €87m on the project, {{in order to save}} another €420m in acquisition and running costs to 2020.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, laser and bright <b>light</b> <b>aviation</b> {{incidents}} were sporadic. In the U.S., NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System showed {{only one or}} two incidents per year. The SAE G-10T subcommittee began meeting around 1993 as the number of incidents grew. Almost all of the incidents were known or suspected to be due to outdoor laser displays. Almost all of the concern was over potential eye damage; at the time visual effects were felt to be a minor consequence.|$|E
25|$|In {{service with}} the French Army <b>Light</b> <b>Aviation</b> (ALAT), the Gazelle is used {{primarily}} as an anti-tank gunship (SA 342M) armed with Euromissile HOT missiles. A light support version (SA 341F) {{equipped with a}} 20mm cannon is used as well as anti-air variants carrying the Mistral air-to-air missile (Gazelle Celtic based on the SA 341F, Gazelle Mistral based on the SA 342M). The latest anti-tank and reconnaissance versions carry the Viviane thermal imagery system and so are called Gazelle Viviane. The Gazelle is being replaced in frontline duties by the Eurocopter Tiger, but {{will continue to be}} used for light transport and liaison roles.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{included}} during the original production run, numerous operators of Pumas have installed additional features and modern equipment over the aircraft's service life. The RAF have equipped their Puma fleet with Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation equipment, {{along with an}} assortment of self-defense measures including infrared jammers and automatic flares/chaff dispensers, and night vision goggles for night-time flights. The French Army <b>Light</b> <b>Aviation</b> have modernised their Pumas to meet International Civil Aviation Organization standards, this involved additional digital systems to the aircraft, this has included new mission command and control systems, such as the Sitalat data link. Third party companies such as South Africa's Thunder City have provided life extension and modernisation programmes for the Puma, some operators have chosen to refurbish their fleets with glass cockpits.|$|E

25|$|A {{licensed}} {{pilot and}} President of the British <b>Light</b> <b>Aviation</b> Centre, Prince William owned several aircraft and competed in amateur air show races. In August 1972, he was {{competing in the}} Goodyear International Air Trophy at Halfpenny Green, near Wolverhampton, with Vyrell Mitchell—a pilot with whom the prince had often raced—listed as a passenger. Shortly after their takeoff and at a very low altitude, the Piper Cherokee banked abruptly to port, with an extreme increase {{in the rate of}} turn and corresponding loss of altitude; the wing hit a tree and sheared off, and the out-of-control plane flipped over and crashed into an earthen bank, bursting into flames. Prince William and Mitchell were killed. The crash happened before 30,000 spectators, the fire took two hours to control, and the bodies were identified at inquest the next day from dental records.|$|E
25|$|On 3 November 2014, the French Army <b>Light</b> <b>Aviation</b> {{deployed}} {{two of its}} NH90s to Mali; both helicopters {{had been}} fitted with three additional fuel tanks to fly the four-day ferry flight to the region. In June 2015, {{it was announced that}} plans for French special forces to operate NH90s had been accelerated, and that the 4th Special Forces Helicopter Regiment were to assist in defining the need for customisations to the type for undertaking special operations. In January 2016, it was reported that Australia and France were studying a potential joint requirement for a dedicated variant of the NH90 special forces; these are to replace French Navy Eurocopter EC725s in this capacity. According to Vincent Dubrule, president of the NHI consortium, the special forces variant concept has, in addition to Australia and France, drawn interest from Germany, Italy and New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} Army transformation, it was re-organized in 1993. The {{division}} of the territory in military regions and zones was kept, with {{the reduction of the}} number of regions, but with the raising of the Airborne Troops Command (using the structure of the previous Air Force's Paratroopers Command) and the Santa Margarida Military Camp as two special territorial commands. The regiments of the Army became again designed by numbers and not anymore by the place where they were based. The assigned numbers were not consecutive, as in previous organizations, but were the historical numbers previously used by each unit or by its predecessor in the same garrison place. The old 1950's plans to equip the Army with <b>light</b> <b>aviation</b> assets were resumed, with the raising of a <b>Light</b> <b>Aviation</b> Unit that was intended to operate helicopters. However, the reception of the planned helicopters was delayed successively until being finally canceled and the unit disbanded. The military regions and zones continued to be responsible for keeping territorial defense brigades and battle groups, mostly maintained only in cadre strength in time of peace. The Army now would have an increased permanent operational force with three brigades: the Independent Airborne Brigade (BAI), the Independent Mechanized Brigade (BMI) and the Light Intervention Brigade (BLI). The BAI resulted from the old Air Force's Light Paratrooper Brigade, also absorbing the parachute qualified members of the disbanded Commando Regiment. The BMI resulted from the fully mechanization of the previous 1st Composite Brigade. The BLI would be a completely newly raised motorized infantry brigade, although inheriting part of the disbanded Special Forces Brigade. Operationally, each of the three brigades had a similar organization that included three maneuver (infantry / armoured) and one field artillery battalion, engineering, signals and services companies, an armored reconnaissance squadron and an anti-aircraft battery. Administratively however each of the brigades had completely different organizations, with the BAI being entirely maintained by the Airborne Troops Command in several of its regiments and other units spread across the country, with the BMI being entirely maintained by the Santa Margarida Military Camp concentrated in a single place and with the BLI being maintained by the several military regions in their several regiments spread across the country.|$|E

25|$|In 1949, Portugal {{was one of}} the {{founding}} members of NATO. In the peak of the Cold War, the Portuguese Army focused on the preparation for a conventional or even nuclear warfare in Europe, during the 1950s. As part of this preparation, the Portuguese Army increasingly aligned with the doctrine, organization, training and equipment model of the United States Army. In 1950, the Portuguese Armed Forces were created as an integrated organization, with the operational command responsibilities of the Army and the Navy being increasingly transferred to unified bodies of command. The Colonial Military Forces are finally merged with the Metropolitan Army, with a single common Army existing since then, both in the Metropolis (European Portugal) and in the Overseas territories. In 1952, the Military Aeronautics arm is completely separated from the Army - at the same time absorbing the Portuguese Naval Aviation - and becomes the autonomous Portuguese Air Force. However, at the same time, the Army activated a small <b>light</b> <b>aviation</b> service for artillery observation and maintained it until 1955, when it was disbanded and its aircraft transferred to the Air Force.|$|E
25|$|Rapid Reaction Brigade (BriRR) - this is {{a special}} forces brigade. It was {{originally}} a fully airborne brigade, with most of its personnel being paratrooper-qualified (including the members of combat support and service support units). It has no longer that feature, now including other types of units beyond those of paratroopers, including the two other special forces of the Army (Commandos and Special Operations). It also used to include the Army <b>Light</b> <b>Aviation</b> Unit, until its disbandment due to the cancelation of the planned acquisition of helicopters to the Army. Its operational units presently include the 1st Paratrooper Infantry Battalion, the 2nd Paratrooper Infantry Battalion, the Commando Battalion, the Special Operations Force, the BriRR Field Artillery Group (L118 Light Gun), the BriRR Reconnaissance Squadron (Panhard VBL), the BriRR Anti-Aircraft Battery (FIM-92 Stinger), the Air-Land Operational Battalion, the BriRR Engineering Company, the BriRR Signal Company and the BriRR Support Unit. Its operational units are barracked in several regiments and other base units across the country (in São Jacinto, Leiria, Tomar, Tancos, Belas, Queluz and Estremoz), with most of these being administratively {{under the control of the}} brigade.|$|E

The rules for 1924 and 1926 required two-seat, dual-control aircraft. Aircraft that entered production after competing at the <b>Light</b> <b>Aviation</b> Trials include the Avro Avian, Blackburn Bluebird and Westland Widgeon, although these had larger engines. The 1924 competition was won by the Beardmore WB XXIV Wee Bee powered by a Bristol Cherub engine. The 1926 competition was won by a Hawker Cygnet.|$|E

500|$|Most {{aerodromes}} {{used for}} public transport operations {{are required to}} be licensed by the CAA. To be granted a licence an aerodrome operator must satisfy the CAA that: the physical conditions at the aerodrome, and its environs, are acceptable; the scale of equipment, and facilities provided, are adequate for the flying activities which are expected to take place; an effective safety management system is in place; and that staff are competent and, where necessary, suitably qualified. Aerodromes classified as developed GA airfields or larger by the GASAR study are, with few exceptions, licensed. Only two basic GA airfields, Silverstone and Duxford, are licensed, and all airstrips are unlicensed. The <b>Light</b> <b>Aviation</b> Airports Study Group, a joint CAA-industry initiative, was established in 2005 to review the regulation of <b>light</b> <b>aviation</b> aerodromes. A particular focus of this group was {{a review of the}} restrictions placed on unlicensed aerodromes. The group concluded that the requirement for public transport operations to be conducted only from licensed aerodromes should be further reviewed in the context of corresponding international and European requirements. It also recommended that restrictions on flight training at unlicensed aerodromes should be lifted, and this was permitted from April 2010 ...|$|E
500|$|The first aerodrome in the UK was {{established}} by the Aero Club at Muswell Manor on the Isle of Sheppey, and in May 1909 it was the venue of the first flight conducted in the country by a British pilot, John Moore-Brabazon. In 1910 the Aero Club was granted the Royal prefix, took responsibility for controlling all private flying in the UK, and started issuing the first British pilot licences. The introduction of the de Havilland DH.60 Moth in 1925 revolutionised <b>light</b> <b>aviation,</b> and the Royal Aero Club, recognising the [...] "vital necessity of promoting civil flying", formed the Light Aeroplane Club scheme. Between 1925 and 1939 around 60 flying clubs were started, and more than 5,000 pilots were trained.|$|E
500|$|Liaison planes {{rose from}} the {{division}} strip every hour to observe the North Korean progress and to locate US 2nd Infantry Division front-line units. Communication from division and regimental headquarters to nearly all the forward units was broken. Beginning at 09:30 and continuing {{throughout the rest of}} the day, the <b>light</b> <b>aviation</b> section of the division artillery located front-line units cut off by the North Koreans, and made fourteen airdrops of ammunition, food, water, and medical supplies. As information slowly built up at division headquarters it became apparent that the North Koreans had punched a hole [...] wide and [...] deep in the middle of the division line and made less severe penetrations elsewhere. The front-line battalions of the US 9th and 23rd Regiments were in various states of disorganization and some companies had virtually disappeared. Keiser hoped he could organize a defense along the Changnyong-Yongsan road east of the Naktong River, and prevent North Korean access to the passes eastward leading to Miryang and Ch'ongdo.|$|E
