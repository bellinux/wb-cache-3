2500|$|<b>Low-fat</b> <b>diets</b> {{involve the}} {{reduction}} of the percentage of fat in one's diet. Calorie consumption is reduced because less fat is consumed. Diets of this type include NCEP Step I and II.

25|$|There is {{evidence}} that prediabetes is a curable disease state. Intensive weight loss and lifestyle intervention, if sustained, may improve glucose tolerance substantially and prevent progression from IGT to type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study found a 16% reduction in diabetes risk for every kilogram of weight loss. Reducing weight by 7% through a <b>low-fat</b> <b>diet</b> and performing 150 minutes of exercise a week is the goal. In observational studies, individuals following vegetarian diets are about half as likely to develop diabetes, compared with non-vegetarians. The ADA guidelines recommend modest weight loss (5-10% body weight), moderate-intensity exercise (30 minutes daily), and smoking cessation.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} focused on diets that reduce {{calories}} via a low-carbohydrate (Atkins diet, Scarsdale diet, Zone diet) diet versus a <b>low-fat</b> <b>diet</b> (LEARN diet, Ornish diet). The Nurses' Health Study, an observational cohort study, found that low carbohydrate diets based on vegetable sources of fat and protein are associated with less coronary heart disease. The same study also found no correlation (with multivariate adjustment) between animal fat intake and coronary heart disease (table 4). A long term study that monitored 43,396 Swedish women however suggests that a low carbohydrate-high protein diet, used on a regular basis and without consideration of the nature of carbohydrates or the source of proteins, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|After observing in {{southern}} Italy the highest concentration of centenarians in the world, Keys hypothesized that a Mediterranean-style diet low in animal fat protected {{against heart disease}} and that a diet high in animal fats led to heart disease. The results of what later {{became known as the}} Seven Countries Study appeared to show that serum cholesterol was strongly related to coronary heart disease mortality both at the population and at the individual level. As a result, in 1956 representatives of the American Heart Association appeared on television to inform people that a diet which included large amounts of butter, lard, eggs, and beef would lead to coronary heart disease. This resulted in the American government recommending that people adopt a <b>low-fat</b> <b>diet</b> in order to prevent heart disease.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: There is {{a wealth}} of {{evidence}} {{from a number of}} sources that body weight and the proportion of energy from dietary fat are directly related. However, some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of <b>low-fat</b> <b>diets</b> versus other types of low-energy diets have found no difference in weight loss between treatment groups. Thus, the overall aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the effectiveness of <b>low-fat</b> <b>diets</b> as a means of achieving sustained weight loss, using all available randomized clinical trials. Methods: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS and bibliographies will be systematically searched for relevant studies. Key journals will be hand searched and experts approached for additional studies. Interim results: The interim meta-analyses suggest that, in overweight and/or obese clients, ad libitum <b>low-fat</b> <b>diets</b> are not more efficacious than other types of low-energy diets in terms of weight loss, and also that, in the same population, low-energy <b>low-fat</b> <b>diets</b> are not more efficacious than low-energy diets which are not low in fat, in terms of weight loss. However, the studies included in the two interim meta-analyses revealed significant heterogeneity which will be examined in greater detail in the final meta-analysis. Conclusion: From our interim analyses of the data, we conclude that <b>low-fat</b> <b>diets</b> are as efficacious as other types of low-energy diets in promoting weight loss in the overweight and obese. Updates and the final report of this systematic review will be published in the Cochrane Library...|$|R

50|$|A 2013 {{meta-analysis}} of randomized controlled trials of low- and high-fat <b>diets</b> showed <b>low-fat</b> <b>diets</b> decreased total cholesterol and LDL, but these decreases {{were not found}} when only considering low-calorie diets. It also showed HDL increases and triglyceride decreases in high-fat diets. Furthermore, lower total cholesterol was associated with lower intake of saturated fat and higher intake of polyunsaturated fat, HDL increases were associated with high monounsaturated fat intake and triglycerides associated with high carbohydrate intake. Decrease in saturated fat intake was only marginally related to decrease in LDL cholesterol. The meta-analysis concluded that neither high-fat nor <b>low-fat</b> <b>diets</b> could be unequivocally recommended.|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{the intake}} of {{saturated}} fatty acids {{reduces the risk of}} coronary disease. This paper reviews the merits of two types of diets reduced in saturated fat. <b>Low-fat,</b> high-carbohydrate <b>diets</b> lower plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) but also lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations and raise plasma very-low-density lipoprotein. The predicted net effect on coronary risk is zero. Weight loss with <b>low-fat</b> <b>diets</b> is modest and insufficient to offset the fall in HDL. Evidence for other beneficial effects of <b>low-fat</b> <b>diets</b> in incomplete. In contrast, diets low in saturated fat but high in unsaturated oils improve the ratio of HDL to LDL in plasma and thus reduce the predicted coronary risk. Recommendations to reduce total fat intake are therefore too imprecise; guidelines should aim specifically at saturated and probably also at trans fatty acids, whereas recommendations for restriction of cis-un{{saturated fatty acids}} are not supported by firm scientific evidence...|$|R

40|$|Background: Systems to {{calculate}} metabolizable energy (ME) in foods and diets are {{often based on}} Atwater factors. The accuracy of these factors with <b>low-fat</b> <b>diets</b> high in fiber is unknown when food intake is reduced spontaneously. Objective: The objective was to evaluate the accuracy of Atwater factors and other systems for calculating ME available from <b>low-fat,</b> high-fiber <b>diets</b> when food intake was reduced spontaneously. Design: The ME contents of a high-fat, low-fiber <b>diet</b> and 2 <b>low-fat</b> <b>diets,</b> one high in fruit and vegetable fiber and the other high in cereal fiber, were determined in a randomized parallel study in humans (n = 3 D 27) and compared with various factorial and empirical models for calculating ME. Results: Food intakes decreased with both the high fruit and vegetable fiber and cereal fiber diets. The difference between ME calculated by using Atwater and similar factors and determined ME values was up to 4 % for the refined diet and up to 11 % for the <b>low-fat,</b> high-fiber <b>diets.</b> Various factorial and empirical systems for calculating food energy failed to reflect {{the results of the}} direct determinations. Conclusion: Atwater factors were inaccurate with <b>low-fat,</b> high-fiber <b>diets.</b> Although modified Atwater factors may be accurate under standardized conditions of zero-nitrogen and zero-energy balance, they overestimate energy availability from high-fiber fruit and vegetable and cereal diets when food intake is reduced spontaneously in addition to when intake is reduced voluntarily...|$|R
