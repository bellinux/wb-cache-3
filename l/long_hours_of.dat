5|$|As {{detected}} by the British, repairs to Tirpitz following Operation Tungsten progressed quickly. Work on repairing the battleship began in late April, and 157 shipyard workers and special equipment were transported from Kiel in Germany to Kaafjord {{to accelerate the}} project. Assisted by the <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> daylight at Kaafjord's latitude during summer, three shifts of personnel worked on Tirpitz each day. The battleship was capable of moving under her own power by 2 June, and ready to begin gunnery exercises {{at the end of}} that month. The repair works concluded in mid-July, though the battleship's starboard propeller shaft could only be used to drive her forwards. Captain Wolf Junge assumed command of the battleship in May 1944, replacing Captain Hans Meyer who had been wounded during Operation Tungsten.|$|E
5|$|During the Tudor {{conversion}} of the abbey to a private house the south range was extensively rebuilt, and only the north wall of the medieval structure remains, which makes tracing the monastic layout difficult. Going east to west, first came the day stair, then the warming house where the communal fire burned constantly to allow the monks to warm themselves after <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> study in the unheated cloister. The room was probably vaulted and had its great fireplace on the west wall to allow heat {{to rise to the}} refectory or dining hall next door. It is likely that, as at the great Cistercian house Fountains Abbey, the chamber above the warming house was the muniment room, where the abbey's charters, records and title deeds, {{as well as those of}} local lords, were kept.|$|E

25|$|Fluorescent lamps {{can be used}} to give {{artificial}} daylight. Different snails {{respond to}} day length in different ways.

25|$|Through {{diligence}} and <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> {{study that}} may have compromised his health, Madison graduated in 1771.

After graduation, Madison remained at Princeton to study Hebrew, in which he became quite fluent, and political philosophy under the university president, John Witherspoon, before returning to Montpelier in the spring of 1772. Madison studied law from his interest in public policy rather than the intent to practice law.|$|E
25|$|In 1890, Remington and {{his wife}} moved to New Rochelle, New York {{in order to have}} both more living space and {{extensive}} studio facilities, and also with the hope of gaining more exercise.

25|$|For {{nearly a}} decade prior to 1903, an {{industrial}} union called the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) had been increasing in power, militancy, and radicalism in response to dangerous working conditions, the imposition of <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> work, and what members perceived as an imperious attitude {{on the part of}} employers. In particular, members of the WFM had been outraged by employers' use of labor spies in organizing efforts such as Coeur d'Alene. The miners' frustrations had occasionally exploded in anger and violence, although they had also tried peaceful change. For example, after winning a referendum vote for the eight-hour day with support from 72 percent of Colorado's electorate, the WFM's goal of an eight-hour law was still defeated by employers and politicians.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Human Relations and the definitive published version is available at [URL] <b>long</b> working <b>hours,</b> over-employment and under-employment associated with a reduction in subjective well-being (SWB) ? If they are, is the association long or short-lasting? This paper answers these questions through within-person analysis of a nationally representative longitudinal survey from the United Kingdom. The results suggest that <b>long</b> working <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> work do not directly affect SWB, but in line with theories of person-environment fit, both over-employment and under-employment are associated with lower SWB. However, over-employment is more likely for those who work the <b>longest</b> <b>hours.</b> The duration <b>of</b> the SWB penalty associated with over-employment and under-employment is typically short, but SWB levels tend to remain depressed for those who remain over-employed for two years or more.

25|$|Modern {{stirrups}} {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of styles, sizes and materials and are attached to most saddles by means of adjustable stirrup leathers, which can be altered in length to fit both the size of the rider and the need to remain over the horse's optimal center of balance for a given equestrianism discipline. There are safety concerns associated with the use of stirrups, including a risk that a fallen rider may get their foot caught in the stirrup and be dragged by the horse, or that <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> use without rest may cause problems in the human foot's Peroneus Tertius tendon. Stirrups are safer to use when riding boots are worn, and proper sizing and placement of the foot on the stirrup increases both safety and usability.|$|E
25|$|The Nauruan exiles {{had been}} {{relocated}} to Tarik, Tol, Fefan, and other {{islands in the}} Truk archipelago (modern Chuuk in the Federated States of Micronesia). As on Nauru, they {{had been forced to}} work for the Japanese, and had faced food shortages as Truk was in turn bombed and cut off by the Americans. Despite the best efforts of Timothy Detudamo, Father Kayser, Father Clivaz, and others, conditions were made worse in Truk by complete lack of medical care and the Nauruans' status as aliens. The native Chuukese resented having to share scarce resources with the interlopers, while the Japanese treated them much more harshly than on Nauru. Many of the exiles suffered beatings, and many women were sexually assaulted. All were forced into <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> heavy labor, mainly excavating defensive positions and growing food for the Japanese garrison.|$|E
25|$|There is {{not much}} vintage {{variation}} due to the reliability of favorable weather with little risk of summer time frost or harvest time rains. The main exception, again, is Casablanca {{due in part to}} its proximity to the Pacific. For the Chilean wine regions in the Valle Central, the Andes and Coastal Ranges create a rain shadow effect which traps the warm arid air in the region. At night, cool air comes into the area from the Andes which dramatically drops the temperature. This help maintain high levels of acidity to go with the ripe fruit that grapes develop with the <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> uninterrupted sunshine that they get during the day. The result is a unique profile of flavonoids in the wine which some Chilean wineries claim make Chilean wines higher in resveratrol and antioxidants. Harvest typically begins at the end of February for varieties like Chardonnay with some red wine varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon being picked in April and Carmenère sometimes staying on the vine into May.|$|E
