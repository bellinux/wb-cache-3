5|$|The most {{important}} lesson <b>learned</b> <b>is</b> {{that a number of}} ecosystems, including the one that contains Yellowstone, are specially adapted to large and intense wildfires. This was widely thought to be the case well before 1988, and the wildfires of that year drove the conclusion home. While large destructive fires are unacceptable in regions with extensive encroachment by communities, they are mandatory in a region such as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{if it is to be}} maintained in a natural manner.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{proposes a}} {{holistic}} online course design framework that {{is drawn from}} theory and empirical research-based principles. This framework is aimed at assuring pedagogical consistency in course design at higher education level and facilitation that maximises the potential of contemporary technology for student <b>learning.</b> It <b>is</b> organised into complementary and often overlapping principles about <b>learning</b> that <b>are</b> drawn from published research. The principles discussed in this chapter included: learning occuring within a community of practice; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> learner-centred; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> flexible and based on individual needs; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> resource-based, and technology-mediated; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> both individual, and networked; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> demonstrated when new, and valued knowledge <b>is</b> created; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> cognitive, affective, social and sensory-motor; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> best supported through constructive alignment of assessment, curriculum and pedagogy; and <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> best when activities are purposeful and aligned with assessment...|$|R

25|$|In {{learning}} to ski, {{one of the}} first skills <b>learned</b> <b>is</b> getting {{into and out of the}} ski, and how to position the body in the ski in order to maintain balance. The skier then learns how to fall and to get up. The skier then works with the instructor on {{learning to}} ski on flat terrain, with the purpose of this exercise being to learn how to use the outriggers. The skier next learns how to get into and out of a chairlift. After this, the skier learns how to make basic turns, edging, medium radius turns and advance skiing techniques.|$|E
25|$|One of the para-Alpine skiing {{techniques}} used by this class {{is called the}} three track method, and was developed {{as part of the}} American Training System. One of the first skills learned using this technique is how to walk with the ski so the skier can learn how to flex the ankle, knee and hip. This allows the skier to determine their centre of gravity. The skier is then taught how hop turn in order to understand arm and leg coordination while on skis. This technique is only used while stationary and is not a competition skill. The skier next learns how to fall down and get back up again. The next skill <b>learned</b> <b>is</b> climbing gentle terrain, followed by learning to go down a straight run and learning to stop. After this, the skier learns how to get on and off a ski lift. This is followed by learning how to traverse the fall line, which teaches the skier how to maintain the ski edge. Other skills are then taught including the Uphill Christie, beginning turns, parallel turns, short swings and moguls.|$|E
25|$|Master of Magic splits spells {{into six}} schools of magic: Life Magic, which heals and protects; its antithesis Death Magic, which drains life and creates undead; Chaos Magic, which warps targets and spews {{destructive}} energies; Nature Magic, which controls {{the weather and}} turns it against the enemy; Sorcery, which manipulates the air and subverts {{the effects of the}} other schools; and Arcane Magic, which is a general school and free for all. Players select spellbooks from desired schools, allowing them to research and cast spells from those schools. The number of spells a wizard could learn from each school was dependent upon the number of books taken for that school. Additionally, the player could select traits instead of additional spellbooks. These traits would provide a special bonus throughout the game. There are global spells that can affect targets all across the world. Unit or city enhancement spells can boost the potential of its target, such as increasing the movement and attack speed of units, enabling them to regenerate wounds, and increasing the power of their attacks. Wizards can summon fantastic creatures related to their schools. The player can research combat spells, which include direct attacks, debuffs and traps. The final spell <b>learned</b> <b>is</b> the Arcane Spell of Mastery, which takes enormous resources to research and cast but instantly wins the game for the casting player.|$|E

500|$|Scenes showing Kristy McNichol innocently burying {{her hands}} in the dog's fur and his normal loving {{behavior}} when alone with her provides a stark image of [...] "how hatred can be familiar, reassuringly close." [...] J. Hoberman argues that the film [...] "naturalizes racism in an unnatural way" [...] in the contrasting depictions of white characters horrified by the dog's behavior, and black characters who grimly accept it as a fact of life. The film's ending has been argued to emphasize Fuller's own view that racism is something that is learned, but that once <b>learned</b> <b>is</b> a [...] "poison" [...] that can never truly [...] "be banished from those it infects." [...] But on the other hand, the dog is actually cured of attacking blacks, but not cured of his own hatred since the last thing he does is to attack a white man, and without being provoked into doing so at that. The ending implies therefore that it is hatred (and not racism) that cannot be banished from those it infects.|$|E

[...] And so it all began to make sense to me." [...] He said Scientology would be [...] "an especially interesting topic for a theater piece" [...] because of its criticism of psychiatry, relative newness compared to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, and practice of requiring [...] "that the follower take courses which cost significant amounts of money." ...|$|E
