5|$|Another rare {{complication}} {{that may}} occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is purple toe syndrome. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking <b>loose</b> <b>and</b> causing embolisms in {{blood vessels in the}} skin of the feet, which causes a blueish purple colour and may be painful.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah usually {{grows in}} open, grassy clearings on old land slips and flat ridge tops, {{particularly}} {{in areas of}} seeping ground water, where the soil is <b>loose</b> <b>and</b> permanently moist. Although these sites can receive very high rainfall, excess water drains away quickly, preventing the soil from becoming waterlogged. N. rajah can often be found growing in grassy undergrowth, especially among sedges.|$|E
5|$|As a song full of {{gospel and}} soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear <b>loose</b> <b>and</b> show {{what she could}} do – which in reality was {{far more than the}} vocal {{gymnastics}} that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of the tune built. The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E

5|$|Cases of {{sick and}} dying trees of C.australis were first {{reported}} {{in the northern part}} of the North Island in 1987. The syndrome, eventually called Sudden Decline, soon reached epidemic proportions in Northland and Auckland. Affected trees usually suffer total defoliation within 2 to 12 months. The foliage turns yellow, and the oldest leaves wither and fall off. Growth of leaves ceases, and eventually all the leaves fall, leaving dead branches, often with the dried-out flowering panicles still attached. At the same time, the bark on the trunk becomes <b>loose</b> <b>and</b> detaches easily. The greatest number of dead trees (18 to 26 percent) was recorded around Auckland.|$|E
5|$|Joe and Bonnie host a {{backyard}} barbecue, where Joe's baby daughter, Susie, {{gets into a}} fight with Stewie over a doll and attacks him. Upset by this, Peter takes Stewie to train at the local gymnasium. A trainer notices Stewie struggling with barbells and offers steroids. Peter injects the drugs into Stewie, who becomes incredibly buff and develops an aggressive personality, much to the horror of his family. Stewie becomes tormenting towards Brian. As time passes, Stewie's drugs gradually wear off, much to his shock. His skin becomes incredibly <b>loose</b> <b>and</b> flabby. Stewie jumps out of his bedroom window to avoid Brian's wrath, only to have his loosened skin help him glide to safety.|$|E

Around her neck is a light veil, and she {{is shown in the}} act of nursing. Her dress is a centrepiece of the panel, composed of a variety of blues overlaid with lead white and deep blue lapis lazuli highlights. The inner parts of her robe contain violet coloured fabrics, lined with greyish blues and purples.|$|E

5|$|Pacer was {{released}} in October 1995. The group toured the United States, Europe, and Australia, with bands including the Foo Fighters, Sonic Youth, and Guided by Voices. Critics commented on the <b>loose</b> <b>and</b> rough quality of these performances. The Amps continued as a group until 1996, when Deal changed their name back to the Breeders. By 2000, Macpherson, Lerma, and Farley had left the band; they were all at times involved in various projects with Guided by Voices' Robert Pollard. Deal's next album, the Breeders' Title TK, {{was released}} seven years after Pacer.|$|E
5|$|The Queens Hall {{opened in}} 1957, it was {{originally}} Victoria Road Weslyan Methodist Chapel. It was in use as a theatre and concert hall until the opening of The Brindley in Runcorn in 2004. The Queens Hall was demolished (December 2011 – February 2012). Adjacent to the hall, in Lacey Street, is the Queen's Hall Studio, originally built as a Sunday School in 1879. It was a venue for music and live performance but closed in 2004. After years of campaigning by the volunteer group <b>Loose,</b> <b>and</b> {{with the support of}} the Community Assets Fund/Big Lottery Fund and WREN and other donors, it re-opened on 17 April 2010.|$|E
5|$|The third {{storm of}} the season was first {{observed}} in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on September20. Strengthening while heading northeastward, the system made landfall near Boca Grande, Florida with winds of 70mph (110km/h) early on the following day. Heavy rainfall in Tampa caused the streets and sideways to become inundated, leaving portions of the city impassable, especially areas adjacent to the DeSoto Hotel. Two fire stations were severely damaged. On {{the east coast of}} Florida, the worst impact occurred in Cocoa, where some buildings were destroyed and others were deroofed. Further north in Fernandina Beach, ships in the harbor broke <b>loose</b> <b>and</b> tossed about, leaving considerable damage.|$|E

5|$|Vettel {{continued}} {{to open his}} lead on Kovalainen; by lapeight it stood at 6.3seconds. Both Räikkönen and Hamilton passed Fisichella in separate manoeuvres over the next twolaps. Hamilton took 11thposition from Räikkönen on lap11, outbraking the Ferrari at turnfour. Fisichella collided with Coulthard twolaps later. As {{a result of the}} contact, the Force India's front wing broke <b>loose</b> <b>and</b> lodged under the car. Consequently, Fisichella lost control at turnnine, spinning into the gravel trap and retiring. Massa overtook Rosberg for fourth on the same lap, beginning a close fight where both drivers repeatedly exchanged positions over the next threelaps. Massa eventually consolidated fourth position on lap15. Hamilton passed Heidfeld, Glock, Kubica and Alonso in separate manoeuvres, to sit in seventh by lap19.|$|E
5|$|While Tszyu {{celebrated in}} his corner, Judah was in disbelief of what just {{happened}} and became infuriated. Judah picked up his stool and hurled it towards center ring. While being restrained by his father and trainer, Yoel Judah, he broke <b>loose</b> <b>and</b> walked up to Nady and stuck his gloved fist into his neck {{and had to be}} pulled off by cornermen.

5|$|A {{manuscript}} {{of the first}} quarter of the ninth century, Vatican Pal. lat. 899 (Codex Palatinus), known as P, and its direct and indirect copies. P was written at Lorsch in Caroline minuscule. The text in this manuscript has several lacunae marked with dots indicating the missing letters, a confusion in the order of the biographies between Verus and Alexander, and the transposition of several passages: two long ones which correspond to a quire of the original which became <b>loose</b> <b>and</b> was then inserted in a wrong place, and a similar transposition in Carus. P is also distinguished by a succession of six centuries of editorial corrections, beginning with the original scribe, and includes such worthies as Petrarch and Poggio Bracciolini; none of these editors betray any knowledge of any other witness.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, Chelsea Bridge was in poor condition. It {{was unable to}} carry the {{increasing}} volume of traffic caused by the growth of London and the increasing popularity of the automobile; between 1914 and 1929 use of the bridge almost doubled from 6,500 to 12,600 vehicles per day. In addition, parts of its structure were beginning to work <b>loose,</b> <b>and</b> in 1922 the gilded finials on the towers {{had to be removed}} because of concerns that they would fall off. Architectural opinion had turned heavily against Victorian styles and Chelsea Bridge was now deeply unpopular with architects; former President of the Royal Institute of British Architects Reginald Blomfield spoke vehemently against its design in 1921, and there were few people supporting the preservation of the old bridge. In 1926 the Royal Commission on Cross-river Traffic recommended that Chelsea Bridge be rebuilt or replaced.|$|E
5|$|Changes in the grazing {{habits of}} Ethiopia's {{indigenous}} peoples following the recent trend of settling in permanent villages have negatively impacted the Stresemann's bushcrow. While previously grazers left the soil <b>loose</b> <b>and</b> covered in dung {{to support the}} bushcrow's prey, this new lifestyle has resulted in overgrazing and soil compaction in some areas. The idea of private land ownership has also led to intensive planting of cash crops such as maize. The rich soil that the species needs to forage is also prime farming land. In the Yabello Wildlife Sanctuary, acacia trees are being collected for firewood, removing the bushcrow's nesting site. While protected under law, this sanctuary has difficulties enforcing the law. It is believed that between 1999 and 2003 {{the population of the}} bushcrow declined by 80%.|$|E
5|$|Chhinnamasta {{may have}} a lolling tongue. Her hair is <b>loose</b> <b>and</b> dishevelled and {{sometimes}} decorated with flowers. Alternately, in some images, her hair is tied. Additionally, she is described as having a third eye on her forehead and a jewel on her forehead, which is tied to a snake or a crown on the severed head. The crescent moon may also adorn her head. Chhinnamasta is depicted wearing a serpent as the sacred thread and a mundamala (garland of skulls or severed heads and bones), along with other various gold or pearl ornaments around her neck. Bangles and waist-belt ornaments may be also depicted. She may also wear a snake {{around her neck and}} serpentine earrings. Three streams of blood spring from her neck, one entering her own mouth, while the others are drunk by her female yogini companions, who flank her.|$|E
