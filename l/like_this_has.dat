Finn Jones, who was cast concurrently in the leading role for the upcoming television series Marvel's Iron Fist, spoke about his departure saying, [...] "I had been on Thrones for six years. It was yearly employment. Now I was at a crossroads and I had {{to think of what}} the future is. I was very blessed that something <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> come along at the right moment," [...] referring to Iron Fist. Eugene Simon also spoke about his learning of his departure, saying that the showrunners promised a [...] "huge scene" [...] for his character in the season finale, with Simon responding, [...] "for everything that you've done for the last six years, thank you. This is a wonderful way to go. I really, really appreciate it, and I look forward to doing it for you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before Jesus, {{exorcism}} {{had been}} {{conducted by a}} trained practitioner who offered a diagnosis and administered a ritual usually employing spoken formularies, amulets or other objects, or compounds of substances resembling pharmacological recipes of the time. Jesus's approach seemed radical because it depended on spiritual authority alone. Jesus casts out the pneuma alalon {{in front of a}} crowd who exclaim [...] "Nothing <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> ever happened in Israel!" [...] The Pharisees, also witnesses, counter that [...] "the leader of the demons gives him power to force out demons." [...] This accusation leads to the [...] "Beelzebub controversy." [...] warns that attributing the power of the Holy Spirit to possession by an [...] "unclean spirit" [...] is a sin that cannot be forgiven. The theological concept is difficult and subject to varying interpretations.|$|E

Entire families perished and the death rate is extremely high. This is unacceptable, terrible and very grave. Once upon a time Tibet lived through a dark age of barbaric feudalism, but there were never any such shortages of food, especially after the rise of Buddhism. In the Tibetan regions, the masses are living in such poverty that the elderly and children are dying of starvation or are so weak that {{they are unable to}} fight off diseases and they die. Never anything <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> ever happened before in the entire history of Tibet. No one could imagine such terrible famines, not even in your worst dreams. In some areas, if someone gets a cold, they inevitably contaminate hundreds of other people and the majority die." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sound the Alarm is {{the first}} album in a trilogy with the theme of self-discovery. It was {{followed}} by Under the Boards (2007) and Daybreak (2011). Conley said that Sound the Alarm was [...] "an expression of discontent. Under the Boards is reflection and remorse. Daybreak is acceptance." [...] He {{also said that the}} three-album concept was: [...] "just a bit of a therapeutic experiment". I felt like all twisted up and broken inside and just angry and confused and depressed and sad and I couldnâ€™t really deal with the world or myself. So I was just <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> got to end, I have to at least try and get a grip on the world and on myself. So I dove into the depths of my mind and brought out what I was finding, so the first album was filled with all the anger, the surface pain, and all the paranoid delusional thoughts that were there.|$|E
2500|$|A {{connection}} to Tiamat {{has been suggested}} with parallels to her description as [...] "Ummu-Hubur". Hubur is also {{referred to in the}} Enuma Elish as [...] "mother sea Hubur, who fashions all things". The river Euphrates has been identified with Hubur as the source of fertility in Sumer. This Babylonian [...] "river of creation" [...] has been linked to the Hebrew [...] "river of paradise". [...] Gunkel and Zimmern suggested resemblance in expressions and a possible connection between the Sumerian river and that found in later literary tradition in the Book of Ezekiel (...) likely influencing imagery of the [...] "River of Water of Life" [...] in the Apocalypse (...) [...] They also noted a connection between the [...] "Water of Life" [...] in the legend of Adapa and a myth translated by A.H. Sayce called [...] "An address to the river of creation". Delitzch has suggested the similar Sumerian word Habur probably meant [...] "mighty water source", [...] "source of fertility" [...] or the <b>like.</b> <b>This</b> <b>has</b> suggested the meaning of Hubur to be [...] "river of fertility in the underworld". Linda Foubister has suggested [...] the river of creation was linked with the importance of rivers and rain in the fertile crescent and suggested it was related to the underworld as rivers resemble snakes. Samuel Eugene Balentine suggested that the [...] "pit" [...] (sahar) and [...] "river" [...] or [...] "channel" [...] (salah) in the Book of Job (...) were referencing the Hubur. The god Marduk was praised for restoration or saving individuals from death when he drew them out of the waters of the Hubur, a later reference to this theme is made in Psalm 18 (...) [...]|$|E
