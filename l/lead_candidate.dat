5|$|At the Red Electoral Alliance's city {{convention}} Folkvord {{was elected}} their <b>lead</b> <b>candidate</b> in Oslo for the 2005 election. Folkvord, along with Torstein Dahle, {{were the only}} representatives from the party who had a chance of gaining a seat in parliament. Jens Stoltenberg, leader of the Labour Party, was negative towards {{the idea of having}} any representatives from the Red Electoral Alliance in parliament, saying that the voters should do anything in their power to stop them from earning a seat in parliament. When the votes were counted Folkvord did not gain a seat in parliament.|$|E
5|$|On 27 February 2007 Folkvord {{announced}} he would seek another term in the City Council. Folkvord was re-elected <b>lead</b> <b>candidate</b> for the municipal election at the party convention. In March 2007 the Red Electoral Alliance and the Workers' Communist Party merged and established Red. By 3 September, six {{days before the election}} day, Red earned its best showing ever in Oslo earning 4.4% in an opinion poll — an increase of 0.3% from the previous election. When the votes for the municipality of Oslo were counted the party had managed to gain three seats on the City Council, with Folkvord's position secure. At national level Red had received 1.9% and 2.1% for the municipal and county elections respectively.|$|E
5|$|While {{political}} maneuvering {{was continuing}} in Minnesota, by early April {{it was reported}} that Nashville had become the favored place for relocation over New Orleans. The Nashville offer became the preferred option as it included $80 million for the franchise from Gaylord Entertainment and an additional $20 million to be paid to the city of Minneapolis to pay down debt at the Target Center. New Orleans later reemerged as the <b>lead</b> <b>candidate</b> for relocation by the end of April when Top Rank announced a purchase price of $152.5 million. By early May, the Minnesota state legislature approved a bill that would use public funds to purchase the Target Center for $48 million. The purchase by the state was contingent on ownership agreeing to keep the franchise in the arena for 30 years. However, ownership could not find a local suitor willing to pay what Top Rank had offered for the franchise setting the stage for relocation.|$|E

500|$|Folkvord {{was elected}} the Red Electoral Alliance's Oslo <b>lead</b> <b>candidate</b> in June 1992. The {{decision}} was made based on party leader Aksel Nærstad's belief that Folkvord could easily win a seat since {{he had become a}} [...] "national celebrity" [...] of sorts and due to the support Folkvord enjoyed during the 1989 parliamentary election. Folkvord needed 14,000 votes to earn a seat in parliament. In January 1993, at the national convention, several long-standing members discussed the best way to organise Folkvord's Oslo electoral campaign. There was optimism among these members believed, along with Nærstad, and they believed before hand that Folkvord would be elected to parliament. The Red Electoral Alliance used a total of [...] for their nationwide 1993 election campaign, two thirds of it being used to support Folkvords campaign in Oslo. When announcing the results the party managed to become the biggest party in six different constituencies: Grünerløkka, Ankertorget, Tøyen, Kampen, Vålerenga and Gamlebyen. Various analysists, and Folkvord himself, believed the Red Electoral Alliance achieved good results in Oslo because of the Socialist Left Party's bad election results in the municipality.|$|E

Retrospective VS on GPCR/ligand co-crystal structures revealed stark differences in the ability of different structures to identify known ligands, despite being co-crystallized with the same ligand. When using the OpenEye toolkit and the ICM modeling package, we identify criteria associated with the predictive power of binding pockets in VS that consists of a combination of ligand/receptor interaction pattern and predicted ligand/receptor interaction strength. These findings can guide the selection and refinement of GPCR binding pockets for use in SBDD programs and may also provide a potential framework for evaluating the ability of computational GPCR binding pocket refinement tools in improving the predictive power of binding pockets...|$|R
