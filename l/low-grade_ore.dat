25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1870s, Thomas Edison became {{interested}} and involved with mining. High-grade iron ore was scarce {{on the east coast}} of the United States and Edison tried to mine <b>low-grade</b> <b>ore.</b> Edison developed a process using rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons. The dust was then sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust. Despite the failure of his mining company, the Edison Ore Milling Company, Edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWith {{increasing}} {{global demand}} of iron ores {{due to the}} huge requirement of steel all over the world, important iron ore producing countries have increased their production by initiating steps to utilize the <b>low-grade</b> iron <b>ores,</b> fines and slimes. The main difficulty in processing and utilization of <b>low-grade</b> iron <b>ores</b> primarily stems from their mineralogical characteristics {{as well as the}} soft nature of some ores and their high silica content. Thus, beneficiating the <b>low-grade</b> iron <b>ores</b> to remove the gangue minerals and enhancing their grade is an attractive proposition today. Among the known iron deposits in Karnataka, many are of low-grade which require beneficiation to produce an acceptable feed for steel making plants...|$|R
500|$|After the {{completion}} of the Alaska Railroad, it became economically feasible to bring in heavy equipment and build gold dredges to work the large amount of <b>low-grade</b> <b>ore</b> that remained after the Fairbanks Gold Rush. The best example of this is the construction of Davidson Ditch, a [...] aqueduct built between 1924 and 1929 to provide water for gold dredging. Fairbanks Exploration Company (FE Co.), a division of the United States Smelting, Refining and Mining Company, built both the aqueduct and many of the dredges that used its water to process ore. Large-scale dredging began in 1928, and FE Co. became the town's biggest employer. It built the biggest power plant in Alaska to provide electricity for the dredges, and it built pumping stations to provide them with water from the Chena and other rivers.|$|E

2500|$|Dunn's {{intestinal}} fortitude {{is responsible}} for his claim to at least two significant innovations in the industry. Hematite ore was {{the foundation of the}} steel industry in 1935, and it was indeed exploited by Algoma. Next to a hematite deposit owned by Algoma was a mountain more than 1,000 feet high but it contained a <b>low-grade</b> <b>ore</b> called siderite. The experts unanimously declared that Dunn, who wanted to exploit this mountain of siderite, was mad. Nowhere else in the world was an ore of this grade in commercial use. In the early months of 1939, a pilot process seemed to indicate success, but in order to be ascertained it would require full production. [...] Dunn carried the investment through to the end and a positive result was his reward. The next innovation which Dunn developed into production at Algoma was then known as the [...] "Sink-Float process". The need for innovation was due to the exhaustion of ore supplies at the Helen mine. [...] The process, which had been established at Broken Hill Proprietary by Guillaume Daniel Delprat {{at the turn of the}} century because of a similar exhaustion, had been tried once or twice in the US but on ore quite different from that at the Victoria. No Canadian mines had developed this technique; no large-scale equipment was available for experimentation and so the pilot plant would be uncertain and expensive. The gamble was a success, and Dunn pioneered again. The Victoria mine was able for a time from 1945 to supplant the Helen mine, while the latter changed from an open-pit to, in 1949, an underground operation.|$|E
