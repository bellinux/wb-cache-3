5|$|Oganesson has {{the highest}} atomic number and highest atomic mass of all known elements. The {{radioactive}} oganesson atom is very unstable, and since 2005, only five (possibly six) atoms of the isotope 294Og have been detected. Although this allowed very little experimental characterization of its properties and possible compounds, theoretical calculations have resulted in many predictions, including some surprising ones. For example, although oganesson {{is a member of}} group18 – the first synthetic element to be so – it may be significantly reactive, unlike all the other elements of that group (the noble gases). It was formerly thought to be a gas under normal conditions but is now predicted to be a solid due to relativistic effects. On the periodic table of the elements it is a p-block element and the <b>last</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the 7th period.|$|E

The Hokies punted after going three and out, but the ball bounced off Alabama kick {{returner}} Alvin Richard. The loose ball was recovered by Virginia Tech's Cory Bird, and the Hokies' offense returned to the field with 35 seconds remaining in the quarter. From the Alabama 19-yard line, Clark scrambled for a one-yard gain. The play was the <b>last</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the third quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 247.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe {{was formed}} in 1947, and their first major act to improve {{transportation}} was the joint UN declaration numbered 1264. Signed in Geneva on September 16, 1950, it was named the Declaration on the Construction of Main International Traffic Arteries, which defined the first E-road network. This declaration was amended several times before November 15, 1975, when it {{was replaced by the}} European Agreement on Main International Traffic Arteries (AGR), which established a route-numbering system and improved standards for roads on the list. The AGR went through several changes, the <b>last</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> which, as of 2011, occurred 2008.

5|$|Juan Martín del Potro and Roger Federer {{have played}} 24 times with Federer leading 18–6. They have met seven times in Grand Slam tournaments with Federer leading 5–2. Their two most famous Grand Slam tournament {{meetings}} came in 2009. The first {{was in the}} French Open semifinals, when Federer survived a five-set clash {{when he was on}} his way to the only French title of his career. The second was in the final of the US Open, where del Potro stunned five-time defending champion Federer in five sets, ending his 20-match winning streak at Grand Slams. Another high-profile match was in the semifinals of the 2012 London Olympics, where Federer prevailed 19–17 in the final set to secure the Olympic silver medal. They also met in the finals of the Swiss Indoors in 2012, 2013 and 2017, with del Potro prevailing on first two occasions, and Federer on <b>last</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them in tight three-set matches. In the 2017 U.S. Open quarterfinals, in a rematch of the 2009 US Open final, Del Potro again stunned Federer in four sets to end his unbeaten streak in grand slams that year. With this win, Del Potro also denied the first Federer-Nadal match at US Open, as in 2009 where he crushed Nadal in straight sets in the semifinals. Federer, however avenged this loss at the Shanghai Masters semifinals, where he beat del Potro in three sets after coming from a set down.|$|E

25|$|Jules Jeanneney and Edouard Herriot, Presidents {{respectively}} of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, urged Lebrun to reappoint Reynaud as Prime Minister (all {{four men}} {{wanted to continue}} the war from North Africa). Lebrun felt he {{had little choice but}} to appoint Pétain, who already had a ministerial team ready, as Prime Minister. Pétain became the leader of the new government (the <b>last</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Third Republic), and signed the armistice on 22 June. De Gaulle had returned to Bordeaux at around 10pm on 16 June. He visited Reynaud, who still hoped to go to North Africa and declined to come to London. Reynaud still had control of secret government funds until the handover of power the next day, and made money available to de Gaulle. De Gaulle flew to London with Edward Spears at 9 am on 17 June, and the next day made his famous broadcast announcing that he would fight on. It has been suggested that Reynaud had ordered de Gaulle to go to London, but no written evidence has ever been found to confirm this.|$|E
25|$|Season 5 follows two {{timeline}}s. The first timeline {{takes place}} on the island where the survivors who were left behind erratically jump forward and backward through time. In one of these time periods, John speaks with Richard Alpert, one of the Others, who says that to save the island, he must bring everyone back. John goes to the same underground station Ben went to. After moving the wheel himself, John is transported to the Sahara in 2007, as the time shifts on the island stop and the survivors are stranded with the Dharma Initiative in 1974. In 2007, John contacts the Oceanic Six, but {{no one wants to}} return. The <b>last</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Oceanic Six he finds is a depressed Jack. John tells Jack his father is alive on the island. This seriously affects Jack, and he begins taking flights, hoping to crash on the island again. Ben finds John and kills him. After John's death, the Oceanic Six are told to board the Ajira Airways Flight 316 to return to the island and in order to go back, they have to take John Locke's body in the plane. They take the flight, but some land in 1977, in which they meet with the other survivors who are now part of the Dharma Initiative, and others land in 2007. The survivors in 1977 are told by Daniel Faraday that if they detonate a nuclear bomb at the hatch's construction site, the electromagnetic energy below it will be negated, and, thus, the hatch would never be built and, thus, their future could be changed. In 2007, John Locke apparently comes back to life. He instructs Richard Alpert to speak with a time-traveling John and tell him that he must bring everyone back to the island. After this, he goes to speak with Jacob. The season finale reveals that John Locke is still dead and another entity has taken over his form just to make Ben kill Jacob. In 1977, Juliet detonates the fission core taken from the hydrogen bomb.|$|E

No grotesque make-up, no funny clothes, just Red." [...] He added that Skelton also [...] "plays a dramatic scene about as effectively as any of the dramatic actors." [...] In late 1965 ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, reminiscing about the entertainment business, singled out Skelton for high praise. [...] "It's all so very different today.
