5|$|At present, all Singapore lines {{run with}} fixed length trains {{between three and}} six cars, with the future Thomson-East Coast Line using four cars. Since the system's {{conception}} in 1987, all train <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> powered by the 750 volt DC third rail, {{with the exception of}} the North East Line which is powered by 1500 volt DC overhead lines. The North South and East West lines uses an automatic train operation system that is similar to London Underground's Victoria line.|$|E
5|$|The breed has a {{reputation}} for being healthy with a long lifespan. Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct in-line breeding has been prevented. Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> noted for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes. These issues can include hereditary cataracts, ectopia lentis, congenital deafness, patellar luxation, ataxia, myasthenia gravis, Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, and von Willebrand disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} of Thera and volcanic fallout may have inspired the myths of the Titanomachy in Hesiod's Theogony. The Titanomachy could {{have picked up}} elements of western Anatolian folk memory, as the tale spread westward. Hesiod's <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> compared with volcanic activity, citing Zeus's thunderbolts as volcanic lightning, the boiling earth and sea as a breach of the magma chamber, immense flame and heat as evidence of phreatic explosions, among many other descriptions.|$|E

5|$|Gyromancer is {{a puzzle}} and {{role-playing}} video game developed by PopCap Games {{in collaboration with}} Square Enix. In the game, the player moves through a map of an enchanted forest, battling monsters using their own summoned monsters through a puzzle-game battle based on PopCap's Bejeweled Twist. In these battles, the player rotates groups of four in a grid of gems to line up three or more jewels of the same color; when enough <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> created damage is dealt to the enemy. Between battles, a story is told {{through a series of}} cutscenes, while the player and the summoned monsters gain experience and power using role-playing game elements.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural factors, much has been done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear and dark and help keep them that way. Within the park, former overhead electrical <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> buried so they do not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and all white lights have been converted to red, which has the least effect on night vision and astrophotography. Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen berms covered with grass, or shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's Dark Sky Fund has paid {{for many of these}} improvements since 1999.|$|E

5|$|The Marshlink Action Group is a {{volunteer}} group {{set up in}} 2003 {{in the interests of}} passengers using the line. The group are concerned about its facilities, particularly the use of Class 171 DMUs when all connecting <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> electrified. They have reported a high proportion of children and the elderly use the line compared to others in the south east, and that trains are now at capacity but there is no additional stock because of its state as an isolated non-electric line. In 2016, Rudd chaired a working group to look at short and long-term plans for upgrading the Marshlink line, including the potential accommodation of Class 395 rolling stock.|$|E
5|$|The Premetro was {{originally}} intended to include a number of feeder lines to the Underground network, including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina's transition to democracy from the military junta and then the privatisation of the railways, which was a difficult time economically for the country, and only Line E2 was built. New Premetro feeder <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proposed in recent years, however, {{the role of the}} network has given way to the new Metrobus network which covers many of the same routes originally intended for the Premetro.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the new line is to allow {{regional}} and express trains to run directly between Asker Station, Sandvika Station and Lysaker Station, without being slowed and delayed by commuter trains that make frequent stops at intermediate stations. The Asker Line will improve regularity, and capacity will increase from 12 to 26 trains per hour in each direction. Travel time from Asker to Skøyen Station will be reduced from 20 to 13 minutes. The line has received criticism for not being a true high-speed line, and for Lysaker Station not being in compliance with accessibility requirements. Similar parallel, high-speed <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> or will be built northeast and southeast of Oslo.|$|E

5|$|Today, the {{architectural}} and historical value of Malta's fortifications is widely acknowledged, and many {{also serve as}} tourist attractions. All fortifications were included on the Antiquities List of 1925, and virtually all surviving Hospitaller fortifications are now listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands, Malta's national heritage register. The fortified city of Valletta has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO since 1980. The other fortifications around Malta's harbour area, the fortified cities of Mdina and the Cittadella, {{as well as the}} Victoria <b>Lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> on the tentative list of World Heritage Sites since 1998.|$|E
5|$|A {{few other}} <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> tried, {{with the outcome}} varying from an {{immediate}} equality to a clear advantage for Black. The cooling 4.e6 avoids complications and heads for an equal endgame with 4...dxe6 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8, Black's loss {{of the right to}} castle being of no great importance since queens have been traded. If Black wants to avoid this early endgame, he can try 4...Bb4+ 5.Nc3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 dxe6 and now the exchange of queens would give a plus to Black, as the white queenside pawns are isolated and doubled. The greedy 4.f4 is weak because White neglects his development and weakens the a7–g1 diagonal. Black can immediately exploit this with 4...Bc5, which threatens a fork on f2 and forbids White's castling; Black may later push d7–d6 to open the centre, e.g. 5.Nh3 0-0 6.Nc3 d6 7.exd6 cxd6 when Black has good squares for its pieces while White's castling is delayed.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Government manages {{those parts}} of the British railway network within Wales. Cardiff Central is Wales' busiest railway station, with over four times as much {{passenger}} traffic as any other station in Wales. The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network. Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland. Services between north and south Wales operate through the English towns of Chester and Shrewsbury along the Welsh Marches Line. All trains in Wales are diesel-powered, since no <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> electrified. However, the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff and Swansea, is undergoing electrification.|$|E

5|$|The character's {{physical}} appearance {{has gone through}} many transformations, with various special makeup effects artists making their mark on the character's design, including makeup artist Stan Winston. Tom Savini's initial design has been the basis {{for many of the}} later incarnations. The trademark hockey goalie mask did not appear until Friday the 13th PartIII. Since , filmmakers have given Jason superhuman strength, regenerative powers, and near invulnerability. He has been seen as a sympathetic character, whose motivation for killing has been cited as being driven by the immoral actions of his victims and his own rage over having drowned as a child. Jason Voorhees has been featured in various humor magazines, referenced in feature films, parodied in television shows, and was the inspiration for a horror punk band. Several toy <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> released based on various versions of the character from the Friday the 13th films. Jason Voorhees's hockey mask is a widely recognized image in popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Further {{expansion}} {{has been}} proposed, contingent upon {{the allocation of}} funding. This includes {{the second phase of}} the Silicon Valley extension, which would bring the system to downtown San Jose and Santa Clara. Plans have long been floated for an extension from Dublin to Livermore, which would cost approximately $1.2 billion and run 5.5 miles (8.9 km) along interstate 580 to Isabel Avenue. The BART board could vote in spring 2018 on this project, which would be completed in 2026. Other plans have included an extension to Hercules, a line along the Interstate Highway 680 corridor, and a fourth set of rail tracks through Oakland. At least four infill stations such as Irvington and Calaveras on existing <b>lines</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proposed. With the Transbay Tube nearing capacity, long-range plans included a new four-bore Transbay Tube beneath San Francisco Bay that would run parallel and south of the existing tunnel and emerge at the Transbay Transit Terminal to connect to Caltrain and the future California High Speed Rail system. The four-bore tunnel would provide two tunnels for BART and two tunnels for conventional/high-speed rail. The BART system and conventional U.S. rail use different and incompatible rail gauges and different loading gauges.|$|E
