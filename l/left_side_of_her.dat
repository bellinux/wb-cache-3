5|$|On 11 January 2006, Venerable Ho died peacefully in {{her sleep}} at the Man Fut Tong Nursing Home, at about 9:30pm, just one month before turning 98. Until being {{hospital}}ised in November 2005, she had cooked for and looked after herself and played {{an active role in}} running both the temple and the nursing home. During her hospital stay, she suffered a stroke, which affected her speech and paralysed the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body. Discharged in December 2005, she was recuperating well at the nursing home until she developed a chest infection and breathing difficulties a few days before she died.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{her arrival}} to Ramsay Street, Bridget makes friends with Zeke Kinski (Matthew Werkmeister) {{and she joins}} his {{football}} team, despite opposition from bully Justin Hunter (Chris Toohey). Bridget joins Declan Napier when he begins joyriding. During a race with Justin, they are pursued by the police. They return home thinking they escaped, {{only to find the}} police waiting for them. Bridget is banned from seeing Declan, but she sneaks out to meet him at the park, where they argue. On her way home, Bridget trips and falls into the road in front of a car being driven by Susan Kennedy. Susan blacks out, a result of suffering from multiple sclerosis, and hits Bridget. She drives off, unaware of what she has done. Bridget is found and rushed to the hospital, where she undergoes emergency surgery for a bleed on her brain. She remains unconscious, until Rachel Kinski (Caitlin Stasey) visits and pleads with her to wake up. Bridget's hand moves and she awakes the next day. However, she cannot feel anything down the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body and she is told that she could be permanently disabled. Susan realises that she caused the accident and comes forward. She is arrested and put on trial. Bridget remembers that she fell into the road and that the accident was not Susan's fault, and she tells the court. During a rehabilitation class at the swimming pool, Bridget meets Josh Taylor (Liam Hemsworth). Following a disastrous date with Declan, where Bridget is given the impression that Declan cannot handle her disability, Bridget begins dating Josh. Following a roof collapse at an illegal dance party, Bridget and Josh are both trapped in rubble. Declan carries Josh out before coming back for Bridget. Another collapse traps Declan and Bridget together and Declan tells her that he does not have a problem with her disability. Shortly after, Bridget begins to walk without her walking aid and her mobility returns.|$|E

25|$|Tea Time is an oil {{painting}} on cardboard with dimensions 75.9 x 70.2cm (29.9 x 27.6 in), signed Metzinger and dated 1911 lower right. The painting represents a barely draped (nude) woman holding a spoon, {{seated at a}} table with a cup of tea. In the 'background', the upper left quadrant, stands a vase on a commode, table or shelf. A square or cubic shape, a chair or painting behind the model, espouses the shape of the stretcher. The painting is practically square, like the side of a cube. The woman's head is highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves (the forehead, nose, cheeks, hair). The source of light appears to be off to her right, with some reflected light on the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face. Reflected light, consistently, can be seen on other parts of her body (breast, shoulder, arm). Her breast is composed of a triangle and a sphere. The faceting of the rest of her body, to some extent, coincides with actual muscular and skeletal features (collar bone, ribcage, pectorals, deltoids, neck tissue). Both of here shoulders are coupled with elements of the background, superimposed, gradational and transparent to varying degrees. Unidentified elements are composed of alternating angular structures, The colors employed by Metzinger are subdued, mixed (either on a palette of directly on the surface), with an overall natural allure. The brushwork is reminiscent of Metzinger's Divisionist period (ca. 1903–1907), described by the critic (Louis Vauxcelles) in 1907 as large, mosaic-like 'cubes', used to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.|$|E
25|$|Assembling the {{suspects}} together along with Carla, Poirot makes his denouement about the murder. Although Phillip's hostility to Caroline {{was due to}} her rejection of his love for her, and Meredith's sympathy was due to his weariness for his long affection for her, leading him to form an attachment to Elsa that was unreciprocated, both brothers' emotions were merely red herrings. In putting together the case, he reveals that Caroline had been innocent, but did not defend herself in court, because she believed that Angela had committed the murder; the evidence Poirot had uncovered showed that her younger sister had been angry with Amyas and had put salt in his glass as a prank. She {{had the opportunity to}} steal the poison from Meredith {{on the morning of the}} crime, and was seen fiddling with the bottle of beer that Caroline would take down to him. However, Caroline did not wish her sister to be charged for the crime, having felt a deep guilt for injuring her sister in a fit of jealous rage many years ago, which had left Angela blinded in one eye and with a permanent scar on the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face. Therefore, she took steps to take the blame for her crime in order to earn redemption, which explained why she did not claim she was innocent in the letter she sent Angela but believed Angela knew Caroline was. However, Poirot reveals that Caroline's actions had actually proved her innocence, as she had wiped the fingerprints off the bottle because she believed that the poison had been put in it rather than in the glass, and that she would have no need to remove her own--thus, she was removing those of a third party. Furthermore, he reveals that Angela was not the killer, as she had been at Meredith's lab in order to steal valerian from him in preparation for playing another prank on Amyas, but never carried out the act because of the murder, deducing this from the way that she spoke of the theft in the future tense to Poirot.|$|E

40|$|Morphea, or {{localized}} scleroderma, is {{an inflammatory}} disease {{that leads to}} sclerosis of the skin and underlying tissues due to excessive collagen deposition. Oral involvement is unusual and it may produce white linear fibrotic areas with a scar-like appearance, atrophy of tongue papillae, gingival recession and alveolar bone resorption.

40|$|A case of {{parathyroid}} carcinoma is presented. A 46 -year-old female {{was admitted}} to our hospital for fractures of both femurs on July 29, 1983. Laboratory data revealed a serum calcium level of 15. 2 mg/dl, serum phosphate level of 1. 2 mg/dl, serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone 9. 35 ng/ml (less than 0. 5), and % tubular reabsorption of phosphate of 57 %. X-ray examination showed marked osteitis fibrosa cystica. The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism was made. A hard tumor was palpable on the <b>left</b> anterior <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck. Neck exploration was carried out on August 10. The tumor {{was found to be}} localized in contact with the left lower lobe of the thyroid gland. Parathyroid carcinoma was strongly suspected, because the tumor severely adhered to surrounding tissues, thus the tumor was resected en bloc. The histopathological diagnosis was typical parathyroid carcinoma. Postoperative course and the treatment of the fractures were uneventful, and she was discharged able to walk five months after the operation. No evidence of recurrence or metastasis has been seen during the eighteen months since the operation. This is the 80 th case in the Japanese literature to our knowledge and the clinical features of these 80 cases revealed an average age of 41. 5 years old; male/female ratio of 32 / 48; average weight of tumor of 8. 65 g, palpable neck mass in 72 %, bone disease in 64 %, and renal disease in 34 %...|$|R
50|$|The Octoroon Girl {{features}} {{a woman who}} is one-eighth black. In the image a graceful young woman with dark hair, dark eyes and light skin sits on a sofa while leaning against a warm red wall. She wears a black velvet dress with red satin trim, a dark brown hat and a small gold chain with a pendant. In her right hand, she holds a pair of leather gloves. The woman stares directly at the viewer with a soft, but composed gaze. Her face is serene.

2500|$|Juri's {{shirt was}} modeled after a spider, and <b>left</b> the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> breasts exposed at Ono's suggestion. Her pants were {{designed}} to give a [...] "silhouette {{that looks like a}} taekwondo uniform." [...] The black trim on her pants was added to set her apart from other Street Fighter characters who wear similar uniforms. Her colour scheme was originally plain. However, when lined up with other characters, she didn't stand out; as a result, they employed hot pink, a colour not used in any other female character in the game. They added black details to her outfit to make it less [...] "frivolous." [...] A pink crystal, known as the Feng Shui Engine, was added as a replacement inside her left eye after deciding to align her with Seth, in order to more closely tie her character to the organization. The crystal was originally in her stomach, similar to Seth. Other ideas were considered, including having it in one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> palms, one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> legs, or one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> ankles. They eventually settled on putting it in her eye, with design director Kamei commenting that a [...] "big globe in the stomach of a female character wasn't going to look very attractive." [...] He also commented that an eye is a logical place to have an artificial replacement, as well as already being spherical. Initially, Juri was designed to be chubbier and cuter. Gradually the design was made slimmer, though the team noted at some point they had realized they had overdone it and reversed the changes slightly. She was given full legs, and a slender upper body in order to show the contrast. Kamei wanted to make her even more slender, but decided that if she was too small, her kicks would lack impact. Several designs were considered for her face, going through about seven versions before settling on her current appearance, though time constraints played a part in the decision.|$|R

2500|$|The Younger Lady has {{a gaping}} {{wound in the}} <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face. Julian Heath {{suggests}} that the wound was likely {{the result of an}} axe blow. Below her left breast there is another gaping wound, likely {{to be the result of}} a stab wound. In 2003, a scientific team from York University, working under Joann Fletcher, examined the mummy. A member of the team realized that the face wound could have been a premortem wound, and not a postmortem wound as previously assumed. Instead of the Younger Lady's remains simply being mutilated after her death by tomb robbers motivated by malice, it seemed likely the Lady had been injured while still alive. The conclusion was considered uncertain. At a later point, Ashraf Selim lend support to this theory. He noted that if the Younger Lady's had been damaged following the embalming process, then bits of dried bone and flesh could be located in the mummy's wounds. Since no such findings occurred, he was certain that this was a premortem wound. Further, Selim viewed the wound as too violent to be the result of an accident. The Lady had been injured in an act of deliberate violence. The Egyptian Mummy Project which used a CT scan to examine the mummy, located [...] "very few pieces of the relevant broken bones" [...] in the sinus cavity. They concluded that the Young Lady's face had been damaged before the embalming process, and likely prior to her death. Indeed, the face wound was determined to be a probable cause of death for the Lady.|$|E
