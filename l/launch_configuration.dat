25|$|Following the MGVT {{program and}} with the {{decision}} to not use Enterprise for orbital missions, it was ferried on April 10, 1979, to KSC. By June 1979, it was again mated with an external tank and solid rocket boosters (known as a boilerplate configuration) and tested in a <b>launch</b> <b>configuration</b> at Kennedy Space Center Launch Pad 39A {{for a series of}} fit checks of the facilities there.|$|E
500|$|The {{heaviest}} configuration uses {{a single}} booster with an asymmetrically mounted, large, expendable cryogenic stage designated H-185. It was proposed {{as a future}} variant of the Ariane 5 core stage (H158), eventually meant to phase out the main stage in a standard <b>launch</b> <b>configuration</b> with LFBB. H-185 would use a new Vulcain3 main engine, with increased vacuum thrust. When launched with a single booster, both stages would be operated in parallel, and be delivered to a [...] orbit before separation. The remaining upper stage composite would weigh , with a [...] payload performance to SSO. When launching to Low Earth orbit, payload mass can be increased to over [...]|$|E
2500|$|First in March 1978 at the Marshall Space Flight Center {{and then}} again in June 1979, the Space Shuttle Enterprise was fitted {{together}} with an external tank and two inert solid rocket motors in a test-bed or boilerplate configuration. [...] The STS-1 preliminary mission test program consisted of vibration tests in a horizontal mode at the Marshall Center, {{and then in a}} vertical <b>launch</b> <b>configuration</b> on Launch Pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. [...] In 1985, the boilerplate configuration was used to test the Air Force shuttle facilities at Vandenberg Air Force Base, including a full mating on the SLC-6 launch pad.|$|E

2500|$|Cassidy and Marshburn started EVA 5 at 11:33 UTC {{when they}} {{switched}} their suit power to internal battery. For this spacewalk, the [...] absorbent {{system in the}} suits were changed from Lithium Hydroxide to METOX due to problems with Cassidy's usage. Cassidy completed the reconfiguring of power channels in the Zenith 1 patch panel which are used for the control moment gyroscopes. Before the rewiring, two of the gyroscopes were fed by the same power channel. Since {{a failure of the}} channel can knock down two gyros and put the station in a degraded position the reconfiguration was made necessary. This rewiring made the two gyros to operate from separate power channels. Meanwhile, Marshburn secured some multi-layered insulation on the Dextre. Later both the spacewalkers installed video cameras on the front and back of the Japanese exposed facility which will be used in dockings of the Japanese cargo crafts and normal operation. The cameras flew up in <b>launch</b> <b>configuration</b> and now have been installed in an operational configuration, thus completing the JEF assembly. Meanwhile, due to Cassidy's METOX limitation, the deployment of the PAS was deferred to a future spacewalk. Instead some get ahead tasks were completed which included installation of handrails and a portable foot restraint.|$|E

40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to determine the static aerodynamic characteristics of a single-stage-to-orbit space shuttle model at Mach numbers of 2. 60, 3. 85, and 4. 64. Test parameters included various payloads for the <b>launch</b> <b>configurations</b> and various corner radii for the entry configurations. The test results for the <b>launch</b> <b>configurations</b> generally indicated that a decrease in payload size resulted in a marked increase in axial force. Decreasing the corner radii of the entry configuration led to large increases in axial force. The results also indicated {{that the presence of}} an engine door on the entry configuration caused a measurable positive increment in pitching moment. Changing the entry configuration afterbody geometry from a biconic shape to a conic shape increased the normal-force and stability level...|$|R
40|$|Communications {{subsystem}} tradeoffs were {{undertaken to}} establish a low cost and low weight design consistent with the mission requirements. Because of the weight constraint of the Thor/Delta <b>launched</b> <b>configuration,</b> minimum weight was emphasized in determining the Thor/Delta design. In contrast, because of the greatly relaxed weight constraint of the Atlas/Centaur <b>launched</b> <b>configuration,</b> minimum cost and off the shelf hardware were emphasized and the attendant weight penalities accepted. Communication subsystem hardware elements identified for study included probe and bus antennas (CM- 6, CM- 17), power amplifiers (CM- 10), and the large probe transponder and small probe stable oscillator required for doppler tracking (CM- 11, CM- 16). In addition, particular hardware {{problems associated with the}} probe high temperature and high-g environment were investigated (CM- 7) ...|$|R
