25|$|On 18 February 1985, {{the station}} {{changed its name}} to SBS and began daytime transmissions. In June, SBS {{expanded}} to Brisbane, Adelaide, Newcastle, Wollongong and the Gold Coast. On 5 January 1986 SBS ceased broadcasting on the VHF0 frequency. Although many Australians at the time did not have UHF antennas, SBS's VHF license had already been extended by a year at this stage and not all antennas had worked well with the low-frequency Channel 0 either. Following this, on 16 March 1986, SBS commenced transmission in Perth and Hobart. Darwin was the last capital city to receive the channel, with a <b>local</b> <b>signal</b> launched on 20 May 1994.|$|E

Specifically, we first investigate why <b>local</b> <b>signals</b> {{of the conventional}} schemes are applicable to either sine or cosine-phased BOC signals, and then, design <b>local</b> <b>signals</b> applicable to both sine and cosine-phased BOC signals. Finally, we obtain two partial correlations and propose a correlation function with no side-peak via {{a combination of the}} partial correlations. From numerical results, we demonstrate that the designed <b>local</b> <b>signals</b> are applicable to both sine and cosine-phased BOC signals and can remove side-peaks completely...|$|R
40|$|Receptor-triggered {{signaling}} processes exhibit complex cross-talk {{and feedback}} interactions, with many signal-ing proteins and second messengers acting locally within the cell. The {{flow of information}} in this input– output system can only be understood by tracking where and when <b>local</b> <b>signaling</b> activities are induced. Systematic strategies are therefore needed to measure the localization and translocation of all signaling pro-teins, and to develop fluorescent biosensors that can track <b>local</b> <b>signaling</b> activities in individual cells. Such a biosensor tool chest can be based on two types of green fluorescent protein constructs that either trans-locate or undergo fluorescence-resonance-energy trans-fer when <b>local</b> <b>signaling</b> occurs.

50|$|Communicating {{through direct}} contact is {{one form of}} <b>local</b> <b>signaling</b> for {{eukaryotic}} cells. Plant and animal cells possess junctions that connect the cytoplasm of cells adjacent to one another. These connections allow for signaling substances that were dissolved in the cytosol to easily pass between the cells that are connected. Animal cells contain gap junctions and can communicate through these junctions in a process called cell-cell recognition. Plant cells are connected through plasmodesmata. Embryonic development and the immune response rely heavily on this type of <b>local</b> <b>signaling.</b> In other types of <b>local</b> <b>signaling,</b> the signaling cell secretes messenger molecules that only travel short distances. These local regulators influence cells in the vicinity and can stimulate nearby target cells to perform an action. A number of cells can receive messages and respond to another molecule within their vicinity at the same time. This process of <b>local</b> <b>signaling</b> within animal cells is known as paracrine signaling.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the lowest}} sweep speed, the system also {{produced}} a <b>local</b> <b>signal</b> that was {{fed into the}} display and produced a sharply defined [...] "pedestal", a rectangular shape displayed along the two traces. The amplified signal from the stations would also appear on the display, highly compressed in time so that it displayed as a series sharp spikes (blips). As the signal was repeating, these spikes appeared many times across {{the width of the}} display. Because the display was set to sweep at the pulse repetition rate of the selected station pair, other stations in the area, at different repetition rates, would move across the display while the selected one would remain stationary.|$|E

40|$|<b>Local</b> <b>signals</b> {{obtained}} from BOLD fMRI are generally confounded by global effects. In this paper, we make an essential distinction between global effects {{and the global}} signal. Global effects have a similar influence on <b>local</b> <b>signals</b> from {{a large proportion of}} cerebral voxels. They may reflect diffuse physiological processes or variations in scanner sensitivity and are difficult to measure directly. Global effects are often estimated from the global signal, which is the spatial average of <b>local</b> <b>signals</b> from all cerebral voxels. If the global signal is strongly correlated with experimental manipulations, meaningfully different results may be obtained whether or not global effects are modeled (G. K. Aguirre et al., 1998, NeuroImage, 8, 302 – 306). In particular, if <b>local</b> BOLD <b>signals</b> make a significant contribution to the global signal, analyses using ANCOVA or proportional scaling models may yield artifactual deactivations. In this paper, we present a modification to the proportional scaling model that accounts for the contribution of <b>local</b> BOLD <b>signals</b> to the global signal. An event-related oddball stimulus paradigm and a block design working memory task were used to illustrate the efficacy of our model. © 2001 Academic Pres...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} cooperation between learning situated agents. We present an agent’s architecture based on a satisfaction measure that ensures altruistic behaviors in the system. Initially these cooperative behaviors are obtained by reaction to <b>local</b> <b>signals</b> emitted by the agents following their satisfaction. Then, we introduce into this architecture a reinforcement learning module {{in order to improve}} individual and collective behaviors. The satisfaction model and the <b>local</b> <b>signals</b> are used to define a compact representation of agents’ interactions and to compute the rewards of the behaviors. Thus agents learn to select behaviors that are well adapted to their neighbor’s activities. Finally, simulations of heterogeneous robots working on a foraging problem demonstrate the interest of the approach. 1...|$|R
