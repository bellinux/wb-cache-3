5|$|The {{authorized}} <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>enclosure</b> to {{use with}} a console organ was the Hammond Tone Cabinet, which housed an external amplifier and speaker in a cabinet. The cabinet carried a balanced mono signal along with the necessary mains power directly from the organ, using a six-pin cable. Spinet organs contained a built-in power amplifier and loudspeakers, so did not require a tone cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofers use speaker drivers (woofers) {{typically}} between 8-inch (20cm) and 21-inch (53cm) in diameter. Some uncommon subwoofers use larger drivers, {{and single}} prototype subwoofers {{as large as}} 60-inch (152cm) have been fabricated. On the smaller end of the spectrum, subwoofer drivers as small as 4-inch (10cm) may be used. Small subwoofer drivers in the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home theatre subwoofer cabinets. The size of the driver and number of drivers in a cabinet depends {{on the design of}} the <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>enclosure,</b> the size of the cabinet, the desired sound pressure level, the lowest frequency targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common subwoofer driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25cm, 30cm, 38cm, and 45cm respectively). The largest available sound reinforcement subwoofers, 21-inch (53cm) drivers, are less commonly seen.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} technical {{disclosure of}} the Columbia LP by Peter C. Goldmark, Rene' Snepvangers and William S. Bachman in 1949 {{made it possible for}} a great variety of record companies to get into the business of making long playing records. The business grew quickly and interest spread in high fidelity sound and the do-it-yourself market for pickups, turntables, amplifier kits, <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>enclosure</b> plans, and AM/FM radio tuners. The LP record for longer works, 45rpm for pop music, and FM radio became high fidelity program sources in demand. Radio listeners heard recordings broadcast and this in turn generated more record sales. The industry flourished.|$|E

25|$|A {{mid-range}} {{speaker is}} a loudspeaker driver that reproduces {{a band of}} frequencies generally between 1–6kHz, otherwise known as the 'mid' frequencies (between the woofer and tweeter). Mid-range driver diaphragms can be made of paper or composite materials, and can be direct radiation drivers (rather like smaller woofers) or they can be compression drivers (rather like some tweeter designs). If the mid-range driver is a direct radiator, it can be mounted on the front baffle of a <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>enclosure,</b> or, if a compression driver, mounted at the {{throat of a horn}} for added output level and control of radiation pattern.|$|E

2500|$|A horn {{loudspeaker}} is a loudspeaker or loudspeaker element which uses an acoustic horn {{to increase the}} overall efficiency of the driving element(s). A common form (right) consists of a compression driver which produces sound waves with a small metal diaphragm vibrated by an electromagnet, attached to a horn, a flaring duct to conduct the sound waves to the open air. Another type is a woofer driver mounted in a <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>enclosure</b> which is divided by internal partitions to form a zigzag flaring duct which functions as a horn; this type is called a folded horn speaker. The horn serves to improve the coupling efficiency between the speaker driver and the air. The horn {{can be thought of}} as an [...] "acoustic transformer" [...] that provides impedance matching between the relatively dense diaphragm material and the less-dense air. The result is greater acoustic output power from a given driver.|$|E
2500|$|Most home hi-fi {{loudspeakers}} use two wiring {{points to}} connect {{to the source of}} the signal (for example, to the audio amplifier or receiver). To accept the wire connection, the <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>enclosure</b> may have binding posts, spring clips, or a panel-mount jack. If the wires for a pair of speakers are not connected with respect to the proper electrical polarity (the + and − connections on the speaker and amplifier should be connected + to + and − to −; [...] speaker cable is almost always marked so that one conductor of a pair can be distinguished from the other, even if it has run under or behind things in its run from amplifier to speaker location), the loudspeakers are said to be [...] "out of phase" [...] or more properly [...] "out of polarity". Given identical signals, motion in one cone is in the opposite direction of the other. This typically causes monophonic material in a stereo recording to be canceled out, reduced in level, and made more difficult to localize, all due to destructive interference of the sound waves. The cancellation effect is most noticeable at frequencies where the loudspeakers are separated by a quarter wavelength or less; low frequencies are affected the most. This type of miswiring error does not damage speakers, but is not optimal for listening.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Ralph D. Heinz of Renkus-Heinz {{received}} a patent for a multiple entry horn which incorporated multiple drivers for two bandpasses, high and mid, whose sound waves all exited {{into a single}} horn but at differing distances depending on the bandpass. It was marketed as the [...] "CoEntrant" [...] horn. The mid- and high-frequency drivers in the Renkus-Heinz ST/STX product line both exited through a [...] "Complex Conic" [...] waveguide. In the late 1990s, Thomas J. [...] "Tom" [...] Danley of Sound Physics Labs (also known as [...] "Servodrive") began working on a three-way multiple entry horn, bringing the SPL-td1 to market in 2000. The design used seven drivers, with one high frequency driver at the horn's throat, four mid-frequency drivers near the throat and two low frequency drivers ported closer to the horn mouth. In 2001, Tom Danley began developing the [...] "Unity" [...] horn for Yorkville Sound, patenting the improvement in 2002. Following the 2003 release of Yorkville's Unity line, Danley formed Danley Sound Labs and developed a significant improvement over the SPL-td1 called the [...] "Synergy" [...] horn, yielding substantially better phase and magnitude response along with smoother polar pattern. The synergy horn design promises greater power output achieved from a smaller <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>enclosure.</b> Because the design retains pattern control through its crossover regions and over a large range of its total bandwidth, and because the acoustic center of the design is near {{the rear of the}} enclosure, it is more easily combined in arrays for public address applications.|$|E

50|$|Rudy Bozak was not {{in favor}} of using ports or vents to tune <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>enclosures</b> for greater low-frequency output from a smaller box.

By the late 1970s, this stance was considered old fashioned; the greater majority of home and professional loudspeakers were using ported designs. As the first ported loudspeaker model was being prototyped at his former company, Rudy Bozak remained skeptical but was willing to stand back and observe the results achieved using the new scientific design methods.|$|R

50|$|A powered speaker usually weighs {{more than}} an {{equivalent}} passive speaker because the internal amplifier circuitry usually outweighs a speaker-level passive crossover. A loudspeaker associated with an integrated active system is even lighter because it has no internal crossover. A lightweight loudspeaker can be more easily carried and it {{is less of a}} load in rigging (flying). However, active speakers using lightweight Class-D amplifiers have narrowed the difference. Trucking for a sound system involves transporting all of the various components including amplifier racks, speaker cabling and <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>enclosures.</b> Overall shipping weight for an active loudspeaker system may be less than for a passive system because heavy passive speaker cable bundles are replaced by lighter AC cables and small diameter signal cables. Truck space and weight is reduced by eliminating amplifier racks.|$|R

50|$|The {{cabinet of}} the {{loudspeaker}} {{is known as}} the enclosure.

5|$|The main {{speakers}} may be 'flown' {{from the}} ceiling of a venue on chain hoists, and 'flying points' (i.e., attachment points) are built into many professional <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>enclosures.</b> Subwoofers can be flown or stacked on the ground near the stage. There can be more than 50 double-18-inch (45cm) cabinets in a typical concert system. Just as consumer subwoofer enclosures can be made of Medium-density fibreboard (MDF), Oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, plastic or other dense material, professional subwoofer enclosures can be built from the same materials. MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern. Other permanent installation subwoofers have used very thick plywood: the Altec 8182 (1981) used 7-ply 28mm birch-faced oak plywood. Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18–20mm thick void-free Baltic birch (Betula pendula or Betula pubescens) plywood from Finland, Estonia or Russia; such plywood affords greater strength for frequently transported enclosures. Not naturally weatherproof, Baltic birch is coated with carpet, thick paint or spray-on truck bedliner to give the subwoofer enclosures greater durability.|$|R
50|$|The {{bones in}} the middle ear provide {{impedance}} matching between the eardrum (which is acted upon by vibrations in air) and the fluid-filled inner ear. Horns are used like transformers, matching the impedance of the transducer to the impedance of the air. This principle is used in both horn loudspeakers and musical instruments. Most loudspeaker systems contain impedance matching mechanisms, especially for low frequencies. Because most driver impedances which are poorly matched to the impedance of free air at low frequencies (and because of out-of-phase cancellations between output from {{the front and rear}} of a speaker cone), <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>enclosures</b> both match impedances and prevent interference. Sound, coupling with air, from a loudspeaker is related to the ratio of the diameter of the speaker to the wavelength of the sound being reproduced. That is, larger speakers can produce lower frequencies at a higher level than smaller speakers for this reason. Elliptical speakers are a complex case, acting like large speakers lengthwise and small speakers crosswise. Acoustic impedance matching (or the lack of it) affects the operation of a megaphone, an echo and soundproofing.|$|R
