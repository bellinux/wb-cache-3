40|$|This book {{chapter is}} closed access. The {{internal}} combustion engine produces a fluctuating torque due to combustion as well as induced inertial imbalance in the reciprocating motion of pistons. When the clutch is engaged, the resulting torsional oscillations of the crankshaft are transmitted to the transmission. In the transmission the fixed driving gears (pinions) transfer the motion to the driven unselected <b>gears</b> (<b>loose</b> <b>gears)</b> through impacting teeth pairs in close proximity due to the compact nature of modern transmission systems. The driven gears in turn rotate freely on their bearings, as they are unselected (referred to as <b>loose</b> <b>gears).</b> As a result, the idle (<b>loose)</b> <b>gears</b> oscillate within their backlash limits, leading to impacts with the driving gears. The vibrations caused by these impacts are transferred through the transmission shafts and their support bearings to the transmission bell housing, and is mostly radiated as sound that resembles the noise produced when a marble rolls inside a metallic can. This sound is onomatopoeically referred to as rattle...|$|R

The definitive version is available at: [URL] transmission gear rattle is an NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness) concern in the automotive industry. It is induced by repetitive impacts on <b>loose</b> (unselected) <b>gear</b> wheel teeth by their corresponding driving pinions. This phenomenon occurs under various loading conditions and is classified accordingly, including ‘idle rattle’ when the transmission is in neutral and ‘creep and drive rattle’ when the transmission is in a gear with a widely open or a partially open throttle. The phenomenon is also present from drive to coast conditions, referred to as overrun rattle. Engine order fluctuations on the input shaft are considered to be the underlying cause for rattle of <b>loose</b> <b>gears.</b> However, the mechanism of transmission of vibration through lubricated contacts is not fundamentally understood. It is surmised that changes in lubricated contact conditions at different bulk oil temperatures may play a key role and, therefore, offer an opportunity to deal with rattle by a root-cause fundamental solution. This means that a detailed multi-physics approach (including dynamics, vibration, and tribology) is needed. This article provides detailed analytical models of lubricated conjunctions in a multi-body dynamics model of a transaxle seven-speed transmission system under creep rattle conditions. The results show the important role of the regime of lubrication in lightly loaded conjunctions, increasing the propensity to rattle at higher temperatures. It is also revealed that the effect of engine order vibration as an initiating source for rattle becomes significant with reduced hydrodynamic contact stiffness at rising temperatures...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science [© IMECHE]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] paper investigates automotive transmission gear rattle. Specifically, idle gear rattle, where the repetitive impacts of teeth are subject to light loads is investigated. Hydrodynamic regime of lubrication prevails in lightly loaded impact of teeth pairs. Formation of a lubricant film is due to the combined entraining motion of the lubricant and squeeze film effect. A lumped parameter inertial dynamic model, comprising hydrodynamic impact and flank friction for pairs of simultaneous teeth pairs of loose gears is developed. The overall dynamic model includes seven <b>loose</b> <b>gear</b> pairs and rigid body lateral motions of input and output transmission shafts. Therefore, the influence of fluid film behaviour on idle gear rattle is determined, which has hitherto not attracted sufficient research studies. Gear rattle is manifested by a vibration signature, which corresponds to the bands of frequencies due to torsional engine oscillations, meshing frequencies, and impact characteristics of lubricated conjunctions. The spectral contributions are affected by lubricant rheology, specifically its bulk viscosity variation with temperature. It has been found that spectral disposition tends towards lower frequency contributions with reducing lubricant viscosity because of rising temperatures and lowering lubricant stiffness. The findings conform with the experimental results, also reported in the paper. It has also been shown that squeeze film motion plays {{a significant role in the}} propensity of transmission system to rattle...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Automotive transmission rattle is the noise generated due to impacts between manual transmissions meshing gear teeth {{in the presence of}} backlash. It {{is considered to be a}} Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) phenomenon and is originated due to combustion irregularities (engine order vibrations), especially in diesel vehicles. This thesis focuses in the case of creep rattle for the MMT 6 Ford Getrag transmission (six speeds plus reverse) with a DW 10 b, 4 -cylinder, 4 -stroke, 2. 0 litres diesel engine. This particular rattle condition is fundamentally similar to any other where an engaged gear is pertained (drive, over-run or float), with the 1 st or 2 nd gear engaged at a very low engine speed. The numerical models include an initial single degree of freedom (DoF) simulation. It comprises either of the engaged gear pair under Hertzian contact conditions or of a <b>loose</b> <b>gear</b> pair under hydrodynamic regime of lubrication. Once the validity of this model is established and correlated with the results obtained from a single gear pair test rig, simulations of increasing complexity can be envisaged. A 7 DoF numerical model is, therefore, developed. The Hertzian contact model still prevails for the engaged gear pair, whereas an analytical hydrodynamic solution is implemented for the remaining 6 <b>loose</b> <b>gear</b> wheels and Petrov s law is applied to the needle bearings retaining the gear wheels. With the aim of accommodating a fully lubricated model of all the tribological conjunctions, an analytical elastohydrodynamic (EHL) Grubin type algorithm is employed. Also, the energy equation is analytically solved for hydrodynamic and elastohydrodynamic conjunctions, based on the assumptions dictated by the Peclet number. Therefore, under hydrodynamic conditions, the energy equation is governed by viscous heating and convective cooling, whereas in the EHL conjunctions the governing terms are viscous and compressive heating, together with conductive cooling. The retaining needle bearings follow the same heat generation mechanism as journal bearings. The effective viscosity, as obtained from the Houpert s equation accounting for pressure and thermal effects, is fundamental for the study of the friction in the contact. The hydrodynamic contacts are only governed by viscous friction, whereas EHL conjunctions exhibit asperity iv interactions as well as viscous effects. The results obtained from this new 7 DoF model are then compared to the experimental measurements taken from the vehicle tests and various purpose-built drivetrain rigs. A metric named Impulsion Ratio is hereby introduced, aiming to shed some light into the predictions obtained by the various models presented. This metric is the ratio of driving over resistive forces acting on each individual gear wheel. Its use is tested to predict single or double-sided rattle scenarios and, therefore, ascertaining higher and lower rattle levels. The 13 DoF model from which these conclusions were obtained includes shafts planar translation and rocking moments. The rolling element bearings supporting the shafts are, therefore, modelled to capture the inherent frequencies arising from their motion. The final model introduces the effects of transient thermo-elastohydrodynamics. This 7 DoF dynamic model accounts for a numerical solution of Reynolds equation with Elrod s cavitation algorithm for simultaneous teeth in mesh. The results obtained validate the previously used Grubin assumption by comparing the predicted central film thickness along the full mesh of one tooth. Also, the effect of starved input conditions and thermal and isothermal solutions are studied...|$|E
