30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} HF concentration on the period and height of Si nanostructures produced by MaCE, a number of structures within a unit area and average height were roughly estimated from SEM images. With increasing HF concentration, the counted number of structures decreased, {{which means that the}} period of the fabricated Si nanostructures increased. This is primarily due to the enhancement of <b>lateral</b> <b>etching</b> of Si MaCE because the <b>lateral</b> <b>etching</b> of Si can be enhanced by increasing HF concentration, when the oxidant is sufficient for providing extra positive holes (h+) from the etching front (i.e., metal/silicon interface) {{to the side of the}} already formed Si nanostructures [11, 15]. Hence, the nanostructures can disappear without distinguishable structure formation, leading to the period increases, if the <b>lateral</b> <b>etching</b> is larger than the radius of the nanostructures [11]. The average height of the Si nanostructures increased from 308 ± 22 to 1, 085 ± 147 nm as the HF concentration increased. This is due to the fact that the overall etching rate was influenced by the removal of oxidized Si by HF when the oxidant was sufficient for generating oxidized Si [15]. For this reason, the measured hemispherical reflectance decreases as the HF concentration increases. It is worth noting that the calculated SWR increased from 5.20 % to 7.62 % as the HF concentration increased from 8 % to 14 % even though the height of the Si nanostructures much increased. This is mainly because the main energy density region of the solar energy spectrum is located in the short-wavelength region (around 500 nm). This indicates that the HF concentration is crucial for obtaining Si nanostructures with desirable distribution for practical solar cell applications.|$|E

30|$|As {{discussed}} earlier, in wet {{anisotropic etching}} the circular mask openings on { 111 } surface take the hexagonal shape with sharp corners. Figure  5 shows the optical images of mask pattern in oxide layer and the etched profile with 3  µm depth after wet anisotropic etching. As Si{ 111 } is a slowest etch rate plane in wet anisotropic etching, {{there is an}} obvious question about the formation of hexagon pattern {{on the surface of}} Si{ 111 } wafer if only wet anisotropic etching is used. In other words, how does hexagonal shape develop on wet etching of a circular pattern on Si{ 111 } surface? There are two ways to explain the formation of hexagon pattern on the etching of a circular pattern. First explanation is based on the off-axis cut of silicon surface. It is not possible to get the wafer surface perfectly parallel to the crystal orientation. Commercial standard wafers usually are cut[*]±[*] 0.5 off-axis. Although the wafers of more precise orientation can be ordered, these can never be cut perfectly parallel to crystal orientation at the atomic scale. So when the circular pattern is etched in wet anisotropic etchant, crystal planes other than { 111 } orientation expose at the mask edges that lead to <b>lateral</b> <b>etching</b> under the mask layer and proceed till it finds the 〈 110 〉 directions where { 111 } planes appear. The lateral undercutting under the mask layer of circular pattern results in hexagon shape pattern. In the second case, if the surface of silicon wafer is perfectly parallel to { 111 } crystal orientation, how will hexagon shape form on the etching of circular mask pattern? In this situation, removal of the first layer of surface atoms will expose non-{ 111 } planes at the mask edge of the circle that will result in <b>lateral</b> <b>etching.</b> The <b>lateral</b> <b>etching</b> will end up when it encounters { 111 } planes which appear at 〈 110 〉 directions and these directions form hexagon shape on { 111 } surface.|$|E

The long-range order and variability of nanoscale patterning offered in this approach cannot be achieved by self-organized methods of nanopatterning such as AAO templating, nanosphere lithography, and block copolymer self-assembly. Versatility in nanoimprint mould patterns allows this combinatory method to overcome the shortcomings of interference lithography and yet produce nanoscale features, previously limited to research-scale E-beam lithography or deep UV photolithography, on a wafer scale. The Si nanostructures produced in our approach show a high degree of fidelity as the user-defined SRNIL patterns, and retain non-porous top surfaces due to the substrate adherent, and chemically resistant SRNIL resin mask. This method is capable of producing high aspect ratio structures through a simple inexpensive wet <b>etching</b> setup. Minor <b>lateral</b> sidewall <b>etching</b> which arises from prolonged immersion in the etching solution reduces the dimensions of the Si nanostructures and should be taken into account in the design and fabrication process.

The microprobes can be efficiently released using a silicon-loss tech-nique with a <b>lateral</b> underneath <b>etching.</b> The measured material properties of the electroplated nickel and the Sn–Ag solder bump are promising for IC testing applications. Mechanical tests have verified that the microprobes can withstand a 65 -mN probing force, while the tip displacement is 25 μm, and can reliably work for more than 100 000 touchdowns. The electric test shows that the probe array can provide a low contact resistance of below 1 Ω, while the current leakage is only 150 pA at 3. 3 V for adjacent probes.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of laser cooling a semiconductor is its typically high index of refraction (greater than 3), which limits efficient light output of the upconverted photon. This issue is addressed with a novel concept of coupling the photon out via a thin, thermally insulating vacuum gap that allows light to pass efficiently by frustrated internal reflection. Although silicon technology is mature and inexpensive, the indirect nature of the bandgap of silicon makes it unsuitable for laser cooling. The material of choice is the binary compound semiconductor GaAs, which can be fabricated with high quality necessary for laser cooling experiments. Moreover, process technology exists that enables a relatively simple fabrication of a thin vacuum gap in this material system. This paper will present an investigation of heat transport and light transmission across a “nanogap ” consisting of a thin epitaxial film supported over a substrate by an array of nanometer-sized posts. The structure is manufactured by crystal growth of a sacrificial Al 0. 98 Ga 0. 02 As layer on a single crystal GaAs substrate. After lithographically defining holes in the Al 0. 98 Ga 0. 02 As layer, the holes are filled with GaAs and a top GaAs layer is deposited. <b>Lateral</b> selective <b>etching</b> of the Al 0. 98 Ga 0. 02 As will create a nanogap between two GaAs layers separated by GaAs posts. We are demonstrating the successful fabrication of various size nanogaps in this material system, {{as well as their}} properties with respect to reduced heat transfer across the gap. We are also presenting data supporting that the interface quality is high enough to allow evanescent tunneling of light at angles otherwise forbidden by total internal reflection. The implications for semiconductor laser cooling will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{technologies}} for 3 D packaging is forming the Through Silicon Vias (TSV) using plasma etching. For the 3 D packaging of active devices such as CMOS sensors, which exhibit low to moderate I/O counts, it was shown in recent years, that costs for TSV interconnects can be reduced by producing tapered via features, which ease subsequent process steps such as deposition of dielectrics, metal layers and photo resists. For different applications the adjustment of dedicated via profiles is desirable. For the practical use the process engineer is confronted {{with a variety of}} different process parameters, which exhibit strong interactions between each other and therefore make an extensive testing necessary when a new process needs to be developed. The knowledge of these interactions is therefore needed. The etching of tapered TSVs using fluorine based chemistry is discussed in this paper. The influence of the governing process parameters such as pressure, gas flow ratio and power is discussed in order to produce profiles with continuous tangent and minimal surface roughness of the structures. Emerging structures with etching effects such as micro masking or the appearance of profiles with gradient taper are shown in order to reveal guidelines in which direction the process needs to be adjusted to stay in the process window. A model is presented and discussed which is able to predict the profile angle {{as a function of the}} process parameters. This gives the ability to produce tapered profiles from 65 degrees to 85 degrees without the burden of an enormous experimental effort. Interrelated etching performance such as photoresist selectivity, etching rate and the occurrence of <b>lateral</b> under <b>etching</b> is presented as well so that design rules can be derived for the specific process...|$|R
