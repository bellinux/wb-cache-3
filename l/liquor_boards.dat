50|$|Even {{after that}} era, {{the sale of}} {{beverage}} alcohol products remained heavily controlled by <b>liquor</b> <b>boards</b> and publicly owned stores {{in each of the}} provinces.

Opimian is a quietly influential national wine-buying club that has aided in sophisticating the adult-drink trade in Canada.|$|E

50|$|In Canada, liquor {{laws are}} {{the domain of}} the provincial governments.

However, in Saskatchewan and Quebec, one can purchase any liquor available in the world upon the purchase of a maximum of one case, usually 12 750-ml bottles or 9 L. The individual <b>liquor</b> <b>boards</b> must approve each product before it may be sold on shelves.|$|E
5000|$|In 1994, Lauzon {{released}} a report arguing that privatizing provincial <b>liquor</b> <b>boards</b> would result in increased levels of alcoholism, higher prices, and more smuggling. He concluded that privatization would compromise government efforts to combat alcoholism. In another study issued the same year, he accused cigarette makers of investing record windfall profits outside of Canada as their domestic clientele died. Saying there was [...] "no worse corporate citizen" [...] than the tobacco industry, he called for higher tobacco taxes in both Canada and the United States of America. Imperial Tobacco responded to Lauzon's report with its own study; one of its conclusions was that the premature death of some smokers yielded savings to the Canadian health sector. Not surprisingly, this statement was widely criticized.|$|E
5000|$|An earlier 1994 {{report from}} York University, created {{on behalf of}} the Ontario <b>Liquor</b> <b>Boards</b> Employees' Union, {{concluded}} there to be little governmental or public support for privatization. [...] There may be political motivations to keep alcohol sales public as well, as the LCBO is an excellent source of sinecures for the sitting government. Current LCBO Board Chair, Philip J. Olsson, a long-time Liberal supporter, was appointed by the Liberal government shortly after they took power. The previous Chair, Andy Brandt, was appointed by NDP Premier Bob Rae in 1991, even though Brandt had been a Conservative Member of Provincial Parliament for a number of years. In 2007, LCBO separated the Board Chair and President/CEO functions, making the Board Chair position part-time. Olsson receives a per-diem for his work as Board Chair, which he donates to the United Way.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to estimate the}} public and private rates of return that have been enjoyed as a result of jointly funded research in Canada between 1951 and 1981 to develop new varieties of malting barley. The malting barley sector {{was one of the few}} sectors in the Canadian agricultural economy that received private investment funds to develop higher quality, higher yielding varieties. This was all the more remarkable since the new varieties that were developed could neither be patented nor copyrighted by the Canadian malting and brewing companies who made these private funds available. Over the years, the portion of total malting barley research funded by private firms declined significantly as the public (i. e., government) sector increased its expenditures in this area. Benefits of the resultant new malting barley varieties were estimated using the concept of economic surplus. Under this framework, the newly developed varieties shifted the aggregate malting barley supply rightward. This shift caused a change in producers' and consumers' surplus in both the malt barley and feed barley sectors. In addition, the new varieties may have created downward shifts in the supply curves of Canadian malsters and brewers. The extent of the downward shifts of the malsters' and brewers' supply curves depended a great deal on the market power they exerted vis-a-vis the Canadian Wheat Board and the provincial <b>liquor</b> <b>boards.</b> Because the actual degree of market power could not be documented, several different scenarios were presented to depict the various possible levels of private market power. These resulted in a range of possible private benefits and consequently a range of possible private rates of return. The "true" returns actually enjoyed by these private firms should definitely lie within this range. The results revealed that society has benefited substantially from malt barley breeding and, more particularly, from the resultant greater quantities of barley sold in the feed sector. Using the base case assumptions, the average internal rate of return to public investment was 50 percent and, to private investment the average internal rate of return was 33 percent or less. Analyses of the distribution of the social benefits revealed that producers received about 68 percent of the social benefits (coming almost entirely from the feed sector), while consumers received the remaining 32 percent (largely from the malt sector). However, the distribution of these returns was somewhat sensitive to changes in demand and supply elasticity assumptions. In order of magnitude, it appeared that malsters and brewers have enjoyed private benefits in the form of lower malting barley prices, higher extract yields and faster germination time. It was important to note that the historical benefits enjoyed by the private and public sectors have been a result of the combined investments of both the private and public sectors. Had either sector not funded malting barley research, the other sector would probably not have enjoyed such a high rate of return. This implies that in certain circumstances it maybe possible to supplement public research funding with private funding (or vice versa) in a non-patentable product and still produce research results that make both sectors better off...|$|E
