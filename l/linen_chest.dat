"Do you think, Diggory Beggs," [...] she asked, indignantly, [...] "that {{after all}} these years I do not know you as well as I do the {{contents}} of my <b>linen</b> <b>chest?</b> I have never before known you open your purse strings one inch wider than was necessary. Have I not always had to ask, until I am verily ashamed, before I can get a new gown for myself, or a decent cloak for the girls? You have ever been hard fisted with your money, and never disposed to spend a groat, save on good occasion. There is not the wife of a trader of your standing in Plymouth but makes a braver show than I do, when we walk on the hoe on holidays or feast days.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} two days Mrs. Robarts did not make much of her sister-in-law. Lucy, indeed, was not demonstrative: and she was, moreover, one of those few persons--for they are very few--who are {{contented}} to go on with their existence without making themselves the centre of any special outward circle. To the ordinary run of minds it is impossible not to do this. A man's own dinner is to himself so important that he cannot bring himself to believe that it is a matter utterly indifferent to every one else. A lady's collection of baby-clothes, in early years, and of house linen and curtain-fringes in later life, is so very interesting to her own eyes, that she cannot believe but what other people will rejoice to behold it. I would not, however, be held as regarding this tendency as evil. It leads to conversation of some sort among people, and perhaps to a kind of sympathy. Mrs. Jones will look at Mrs. White's <b>linen</b> <b>chest,</b> hoping that Mrs. White may be induced to look at hers. One can only pour out of a jug that which is in it. For the most of us, if we do not talk of ourselves, or at any rate of the individual circles of which we are the centres, we can talk of nothing. I cannot hold with those who wish to put down the insignificant chatter of the world. As for myself, I am always happy to look at Mrs. Jones's linen, and never omit an opportunity of giving her the details of my own dinners. But Lucy Robarts had not this gift. She had come there as a stranger into her sister-in-law's house, and at first seemed as though she would be contented in simply having her corner in the drawing-room and her place at the parlour-table. She did not seem to need the comforts of condolence and open-hearted talking. I do not mean to say that she was moody, that she did not answer when she was spoken to, or that she took no notice of the children; but she did not at once throw herself and all her hopes and sorrows into Fanny's heart, as Fanny would have had her do.|$|E

50|$|The first larnakes {{appeared}} in Minoan {{times during the}} Aegean Bronze Age, when they {{took the form of}} ceramic coffers designed to imitate wooden chests, perhaps on the pattern of Egyptian <b>linen</b> <b>chests.</b> They were richly decorated with abstract patterns, octopuses and scenes of hunting and cult rituals.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Tulliver {{was seated}} there {{with all her}} laid-up treasures. One of the <b>linen</b> <b>chests</b> was open; the silver teapot was {{unwrapped}} from its many folds of paper, and the best china was {{laid out on the}} top of the closed linen-chest; spoons and skewers and ladles were spread in rows on the shelves; and the poor woman was shaking her head and weeping, with a bitter tension of the mouth, over the mark, [...] "Elizabeth Dodson," [...] on the corner of some tablecloths she held in her lap.|$|R

50|$|A Loyalist {{who is very}} self-centered and untrustworthy. His {{commitment}} to being a Loyalist is shown by his various attempts to get the rebels to join the British side; one of the attempts was to bribe them and hiding the money in his wife's <b>linen</b> <b>chest</b> to discourage suspicion.This attempt, however, was discovered thanks to Isabel's report on her spying tasks. He also had a plan to assassinate President George Washington along {{with a group of}} Loyalists; unfortunately their plan was also discovered by Isabel. At home, he is very abusive towards his wife, and he demands to be obeyed by everybody in the house.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{the folk}} {{tradition}} recorded by Jón Árnason, the great serpent in Lagarfljót {{grew out of}} a small [...] "lingworm" [...] or heath-dragon; a girl was given a gold ring by her mother, and asked how she might best derive profit from the gold, was told to place it under a lingworm. She did so, {{and put it in the}} top of her <b>linen</b> <b>chest</b> for a few days, but then found that the little dragon had grown so large, it had broken open the chest. Frightened, she threw both it and the gold into the lake, where the serpent continued to grow and terrorized the countryside, spitting poison and killing people and animals. Two Finns called in to destroy it and retrieve the gold said that they had managed to tie its head and tail to the bottom of the lake but it was impossible to kill it because there was a still larger dragon underneath.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} also acts as {{a reflection}} of the living conditions for those who were employed at the ironworks. The first and most obvious feature of the cottage is the restored living room, which acted as the heart of Victorian households. Not only was it a living area, but it was also where domestic activities such as cooking, washing and ironing took place. Typical features of the living room include the stove, which contained a bread oven; it was this that was used for cooking, providing heat for the cottage and for heating the iron in order to perform domestic tasks. The living room also contains a dining table along with basic kitchen utensils such as a kettle and cutlery. A traditional longcase clock is also located at the centre of the room, although now out of use it was a common aesthetic in the 19th century. Also located on the ground floor is the bedroom in which Joseph Parry was born, also restored; it contains an old-fashioned wooden cradle and also a <b>linen</b> <b>chest.</b> Outdoors features included the outdoor toilet in the garden. This was a common sanitary feature of contemporary time; inevitably contributing to the spread of disease in the area.|$|E
