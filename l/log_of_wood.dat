5|$|On 23 June 2013, Shakira {{released}} a teaser {{of the commercial}} for the fragrance along with a photo of her posing with two cheetahs. A full version of the commercial was released later. It begins with Shakira, dressed in a dark burgundy gown, coming across a pair of cheetahs in an arid desert region. The two animals, alarmed, commence running towards her {{in an effort to}} attack her. Shakira responds by raising her hand, which prompts the cheetahs to abruptly stop in their tracks. They are later seen prowling around her while she is standing atop a rock and a bottle of Wild Elixir is then shown placed on a <b>log</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> The official website of the perfume also features a game made to promote the fragrance and Shakira's Barefoot Foundation.|$|E
25|$|The Ranfurly Shield, {{also known}} as the <b>Log</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wood,</b> has been competed for on a {{challenge}} basis by provincial teams since 1904. The holding union must defend the Shield in challenge matches, and if a challenger defeats them, they become the new holder of the Shield. The Shield was first presented by the Governor of New Zealand, the Earl of Ranfurly. The current holders are Waikato since 2015.|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{undermining}} a structure, some besiegers used borers {{to drill}} holes in the outer walls {{in an effort to}} destroy them; such methods were more effective than rams on brick walls (which tended to absorb the shocks from the ram). [...] Borers differed in size and mechanism, but a typical machine was made from a <b>log</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> tipped with iron and supported and driven by windlasses or ropes. [...] Once a series of holes had been bored along the length of a wall, the holes were typically filled with rods of dry wood, saturated with sulfur or pitch and then ignited. [...] Bellows could be used to encourage a blaze.|$|E

[...] 'By 1933, 'n between times of clearing lantana and carrying out the preliminary surveys for the draining of swamps, the Rovers and Men Scouts [...] have been busy on the erection of a gate of typically Scouty design {{at the entrance of}} their section of Eprapah.

2500|$|Brutality by {{the guards}} was {{another factor that}} damaged the health {{of many of the}} prisoners. Hilda Bates {{described}} the guards' treatment of the male prisoners: [...] "Their favourite methods of punishment are either kicking below the waist with their heavy army boots, face slapping or striking the head with a rifle butt". Failure to bow properly to a guard was a common cause of a beating. Hilda Bates wrote of [...] "One male internee [...] was paralysed for a week following Japanese brutality, simply because he had not made his bow in what the Japs considered a proper manner". E. R. Pepler recorded that [...] "a favourite punishment was to make the offender stand in the blazing sun with his arms above his head holding a <b>log</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> If the prisoner or his arms sagged, he was punched or kicked. This treatment usually lasted until the prisoner completely collapsed".|$|E
2500|$|On 8 July 1788, {{he became}} colonel of the 2nd Regiment of Life Guards and on 30 August 1788 he was created Baron Amherst (this {{time with the}} {{territorial}} designation of Montreal in the County of Kent) with a special provision that would allow this title to pass to his nephew (as Amherst was childless, the Holmesdale title became extinct upon his death). With {{the advent of the}} French Revolutionary Wars, Amherst was recalled as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in January 1793: however is generally criticised for allowing the armed forces to slide into acute decline, a direct cause of the failure of the early campaigns in the Low Countries: Pitt the Younger said of him [...] "his age, and perhaps his natural temper, are little suited to the activity and the energy which the present moment calls for". Horace Walpole called him [...] "that <b>log</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> whose stupidity and incapacity are past belief". [...] "He allowed innumerable abuses to grow up in the army… He kept his command, though almost in his dotage, with a tenacity that cannot be too much censured". He retired from that post in February 1795, to be replaced by the Duke of York, and was promoted to the rank of field marshal on 30 July 1796. He retired to his home at Montreal Park and died on 3 August 1797. He was buried in the Parish Church at Sevenoaks.|$|E

60|$|A great {{vessel that}} they had taken with the town of Maracaibo was {{converted}} into a fire ship, manned with <b>logs</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> in montera caps and sailor jackets, and filled with brimstone, pitch, and palm leaves soaked in oil. Then out of the lake the pirates sailed to meet the Spaniards, the fire ship leading the way, and bearing down directly upon the admiral's vessel. At the helm stood volunteers, the most desperate and the bravest of all the pirate gang, and at the ports stood the <b>logs</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> in montera caps.
