Optimization of the internal parameters used experimental gas-phase geometries, vibrational spectra, and torsional energy surfaces supplemented with ab initio results. The peptide backbone bonding parameters were optimized with respect to data for N-methylacetamide and the alanine dipeptide.

Identical symptoms were observed at 15 °C and 4 °C, but with a longer development period at 4 °C.

The oxygen 130 nm triplet is optically thick in those atmospheres and is resonant with sun radiations. The instruments SPICAV and SPICAM are able to measure the intensity of this triplet without any spectral resolution. The Hubble space telescope with the STIS instrument is able to get enough spectral resolution to see the lines profile. In previous simulations, the overlapping between this triplet and lines of the CO fourth positive band has never been taken into account. We present new simulations calculating the oxygen 130 nm triplet intensity and line profile {{taking into account the}} overlapping problem with a partial redistribution. Due to the structure of the triplet, we had to develop a new expression of the RII redistribution function. The effects of the CO lines modified strongly the O 130 nm line parameters, intensity and line profile. These effects depend strongly of the geometry of the line of sight. We show that it is essential to take this problem into account in both the martian and venusian cases and that this could be a very useful way to get strong information on both the CO and the O states in these atmosphere for various geometrical conditions.
