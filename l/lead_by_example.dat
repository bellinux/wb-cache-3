The results show that only follower but not leader behavior is affected by the introduction of intergroup competition. The change in follower behavior is best described as an increase in cooperation which is not conditional on the leader's decision. When groups interact repeatedly, we do not find that leading <b>by</b> <b>example</b> is able to foster cooperation by itself.

The military, backed by a resurgent U.S. wartime economy, begins the three-year-long process of retaking the contiguous United States from both the undead as well as groups of hostile human survivors. Prewar military tactics and equipment are mentioned as being employed to deal with sometimes well-armed and organized human opposition.|$|E

Original All Black Ernie Booth wrote of Gallaher: [...] "To us All Blacks his words would often be, 'Give nothing away; take no chance.'

500|$|Cox {{resigned}} {{the club}} captaincy {{at the end}} of the 2002 season, and Burns was named as his replacement; Wisden described him as a [...] "dedicated, down-to-earth cricketer who hopes to <b>lead</b> <b>by</b> <b>example</b> from high in the order." [...] In a preview of the 2003 season for the BBC, Simon Mann wrote that Somerset had the talent to improve and he predicted that an immediate promotion back to the first division of the County Championship was [...] "a strong possibility." [...] The season began in positive fashion for Burns; in a first-class match against Loughborough University he scored 83 runs in the first innings and was 118 not out in the second. He continued to score runs regularly, if not spectacularly, throughout the season, and passed 1,000 first-class runs for the second consecutive year. Ian Blackwell and Cox both reached the milestone as well for Somerset, but despite these individual achievements, the county struggled. Eight losses were suffered on the way to finishing third from bottom of the second division of the County Championship, and after one such result, a two-day loss against Northamptonshire in July, the club's chief executive sent a letter to ten members of the team warning them that they could be sacked. A few days later, against Durham, a second-innings total of 56 was the county's lowest score in a first-class match since 1970. Although Burns had a relatively successful season statistically—his 1,133 first-class runs were the most he scored in any season of his career, and his first-class average was just under 40—he offered to step down as Somerset captain, but when a suitable alternative could not be found, he continued in the position for 2004.|$|E
