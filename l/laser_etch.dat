40|$|Laser etched 300 series Stainless Steel Burst Disks (SSBD) ranging between 0. 178 mm (0. 007 -in.) and 0. 508 mm (0. 020 -in.) thick were {{designed}} {{for use in a}} 17 -caliber two-stage light gas launcher. First, a disk manufacturing method was selected using a combination of wire electrical discharge machining (EDM) to form the blank disks and laser etching to define the pedaling fracture pattern. Second, a replaceable insert was designed to go between the SSDB and the barrel. This insert reduced the stress concentration between the SSBD and the barrel, providing a place for the petals of the SSDB to open, and protecting the rifling {{on the inside of the}} barrel. Thereafter, a design of experiments was implemented to test and characterize the burst characteristics of SSBDs. Extensive hydrostatic burst testing of the SSBDs was performed to complete the design of experiments study with one-hundred and seven burst tests. The experiment simultaneously tested the effects of the following: two SSBD material states (full hard, annealed); five SSBD thicknesses 0. 178, 0. 254, 0. 305, 0. 381 mm (0. 007, 0. 010, 0. 012, 0. 015, 0. 020 -in.); two grain directions relative); number of times the <b>laser</b> <b>etch</b> pattern was repeated (varies between 5 - 200 times); two heat sink configurations (with and without heat sink); and, two barrel configurations (with and without insert). These tests resulted in the quantification of the relationship between SSBD thickness, <b>laser</b> <b>etch</b> parameters, and desired burst pressure. Of the factors investigated only thickness and number of laser etches were needed to develop a mathematical relationship predicting hydrostatic burst pressure of disks using the same barrel configuration. The fracture surfaces of two representative SSBD bursts were then investigated with a scanning electron microscope, one burst hydrostatically in a fixture and another dynamically in the launcher. The fracture analysis verified that both burst conditions resulted in a ductile overload failure indicated by transgranular microvoid coalescence, non-fragmenting rupture and mixed tensile and shear failure modes, regardless of the material states tested.

40|$|Introduction : The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} and compare the shear bond strength between the bracket and acid etched enamel, enamel treated with self-etch primer and laser irradiated enamel and to analyze the interface of the enamel bracket bond. Materials and methods : Around 60 noncarious human premolars were divided randomly into three groups of 20 each and etched using 37 % phosphoric acid, self-etch primer and Er:YAG laser. Stainless steel brackets were then bonded using Transbond XT following which all the samples were stored in distilled water at room temperature for 24 hours. Shear bond strength was tested using a chisel edge, mounted on the crosshead of Universal Testing Machine. After debonding, the teeth were examined under 10 Χ magnification with a stereomicroscope and ARI score determined. Shear bond strengths of the three groups were then compared using ANOVA test (multiple comparisons, Tukey′s correction). Comparison of the ARI scores was done using Chi-square test. Result : The acid etched group yielded the highest mean debonding force (13. 34 Mpa) followed by self-etch group (12. 15 Mpa) and <b>laser</b> <b>etch</b> group (12. 10 Mpa). No significant difference was found between the three groups. On comparison of the ARI scores, it was found that the adhesive left on the enamel surface after debonding was significantly higher in the acid etched group than the self-etch group (p = 0. 009). There was no significant difference in the ARI scores between the other two groups. Conclusion : These results indicate that the shear bond strength of all the three groups was clinically acceptable with no significant difference between them but more adhesive was left on enamel treated with acid and laser as compared to self-etch primer treated enamel...|$|E
40|$|Debris {{control and}} surface quality are {{potential}} major benefits of sample liquid immersion when laser micromachining; however, {{the use of}} an immersion technique potentially modifies the ablation mechanism when compared to an ambient air interaction. To investigate the machining characteristics, bisphenol A polycarbonate has been laser machined in air and under a controllable open liquid film. To provide quantitative analysis, ablation threshold, ablation rate and the attenuation coefficient of the immersing DI water fluid were measured. In ambient air the threshold fluence was measured to be 37 mJ. cm- 2. Thin film immersion displayed two trends: threshold fluences of 58. 6 mJcm- 2 and 83. 9 mJcm- 2. The attenuation of DI water was found to be negligible; thus, the change in ablation rate resulted from increased confinement of the vapour plume by the liquid medium, generating higher Bremsstrahlung attenuation of the beam, lowering the <b>laser</b> <b>etch</b> rate. Simultaneously, splashing motivated by the confined ablation plume allowed release of plume pressure before plume etching commenced. This contributed to the loss of total etching efficiency. Two interaction scenarios were obsereved as a result of splashing: (i) intermediate threshold fluence, where splashing occured after every pulse in a mode that interrupted the flow entirely, leaving an ambient air interaction for the following pulse; (ii) high threshold fluence, where splashing occured for every pulse in a mode that allowed the flow to recommence over the image before the next pulse causing every pulse to experience Bremsstrahlung attenuation.

40|$|Metal organic {{vapor phase}} epitaxy (MOVPE) growth and laser {{lift-off}} (LLO) process of UVC material systems for in use of fabrication of III-nitride vertical UVC LEDs are studied. This study demonstrates that LLO can be achieved using GaN/AlXGa 1 -XN based strained superlattice layers to enable fabrication of vertical UVC LEDs in the future. As part of this study, a review of current work on DUV LLO, UVC LLO processing and challenges, and MOVPE growth of UVC material systems are discussed. Experimental results demonstrating full 2 ” wafer LLO are presented in detail. Growth of III-V nitride UVC material systems is quite challenging, making growth optimizations necessary starting with tool and growth method selection. Comparing several types of reactors, a horizontal flow reactor with low rotation speed demonstrated the best thickness uniformity of 8. 2 %. Pulsed growth at 1100 ºC and 10 kPa with high V/III ratio was selected, due to demonstrating the highest growth rate and crystal quality. FWHMs of (0002) and (10 - 12) are 309. 6 and 617 arcsec, respectively, in this growth. <b>Laser</b> <b>etch</b> rate, using a 248 nm KrF laser dosage of 1 J/cm 2 and 38 ns pulse width, {{was determined to be}} 10 nm per burst on GaN. A 20 pair GaN/Al 0. 7 Ga 0. 3 N (2 / 5 nm) strained layer superlattice was employed to absorb the UV laser during the LLO process and suppress the dislocations from climbing to the UVC LED epitaxial structure. 2 nm thick GaN layers were grown and sandwiched between Al 0. 7 Ga 0. 3 N to try to compensate for strain to match the lattice parameters of the n-Al 0. 7 Ga 0. 3 N. No crystal degradation occurred {{as a result of the}} introduction of the SLS into various epitaxial structures as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Furthermore, there is no evidence of cracking or damage observed as a result of LLO processing, as confirmed by SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Lateral LED devices using wafers grown with the SLS exhibited 252, 258 and 266 nm emission, confirming that the superlattice will not inhibit the ability to grow UVC LEDs. Vertical device emission was not observed and may be caused by the heating at the metal interface causing delamination or copper migration shorting the LED device as shown by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) analysis. If the n-layers are increased to approximately 2 μm, catastrophic heating could be avoided. Side wall passivation could be employed to prevent migration and shorting caused by the copper. Successful growth of UVC LED structure and LLO of a 2 ” sapphire substrate was accomplished without any cracking or use of UVC incompatible materials. Growth of a highquality UVC LED epitaxy was confirmed by x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. TEM also revealed a single pair of the GaN/ Al 0. 7 Ga 0. 3 N SLS was sufficient to allow LLO without damage to the MQW. These achievements represent a significant step in the volume of knowledge to help achieve vertical UVC LEDs fabrication it is an early work capable of demonstrating full wafer LLO of a UVC based material system. 電気通信大学 201...|$|E
