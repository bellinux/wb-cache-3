5|$|A thick-line {{version of}} the map, {{released}} as part of Metro's Rush Plus plan, showed the Silver Line spurring off the Orange <b>Line</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Ballston and East Falls Church stations in a northwesterly direction, with five unlabeled stops (the Phase I stations). The final map released for the Silver Line's Phase I opening features the stations shared by the three lines as normal stations, with the dots signifying stations located on the colored line {{in the center and}} small white stubs extending from the center dots into the adjoining colored lines.|$|E

5|$|Blue Line trains share {{a single}} tunnel with Orange Line and Silver Line trains {{to cross the}} Potomac River. The current tunnel limits service in each direction, {{creating}} a choke point. A 2001 proposal would have rerouted the Blue <b>Line</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Rosslyn and Stadium–Armory stations by building a bridge or tunnel from Virginia to a new station in Georgetown. The proposal was later rejected due to cost, but Metro again started considering a similar scenario in 2011.|$|E
5|$|By 16 December, the British 5th Division had {{completed}} its {{move into the}} <b>line</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand and the Indian divisions. There followed a period of hostile patrolling and skirmishing on the XIII Corps front. The main burden of the fighting was therefore assumed by V Corps as the Canadians pushed for Ortona with the Indian Division on their left flank attacking toward Villa Grande and Tollo.|$|E
5|$|Facing the Wehrmacht {{were three}} Soviet fronts forming a {{defensive}} <b>line</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> cities of Vyazma and Bryansk, which barred {{the way to}} Moscow. The armies comprising these fronts had also been involved in heavy fighting. Still, it was a formidable concentration consisting of 1,250,000 men, 1,000 tanks and 7,600 guns. The Soviet Air Force (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily, VVS) had suffered appalling losses of some 7,500 to 21,200 aircraft. Extraordinary industrial achievements had begun to replace these, and {{at the outset of}} Typhoon the VVS could muster 936 aircraft, 578 of which were bombers.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, Schweppes {{acquired}} from the Burrow family, Pewtress Spring in Colwall, {{on the western}} side of the Herefordshire Beacon, approximately two miles from Colwall village. The source emerges at the fault <b>line</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Silurian thrust and the Precambrian diorite and granite above it. The spring was renamed Primeswell Spring, and in 1929 Schweppes commenced bottling. The factory employed 25 people who bottled 26 million bottles annually. It was operated by Coca-Cola Enterprises Ltd., and the water was sold under the Schweppes brand name.|$|E
5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial {{battles between}} male Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing {{the chance of}} being detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path to remain on a <b>line</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> rival {{and the start of}} his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E
5|$|In mid-May, Operation Trio was {{followed}} by the joint Italian-Chetnik offensive against Partisan detachments within the Italian zone of occupation in eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro, with similar effects: the Partisans lost almost all of the liberated territory in these areas. This offensive is also considered part of the Third Enemy Offensive in Yugoslav historiography. After Operation Trio, NDH forces remained south of the demarcation <b>line</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> German and Italian zones of occupation, in spite of protests from the Italians.|$|E

5|$|Nixon's {{career was}} {{frequently}} dogged by his persona and the public's perception of it. Editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms, {{to the point}} where the <b>line</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> human and the caricature became increasingly blurred. He was often portrayed with unshaven jowls, slumped shoulders, and a furrowed, sweaty brow.|$|E
5|$|The {{early history}} of Marylebone is tied into the Great Central Railway (GCR)'s Great Central Main Line (GCML) {{extension}} into London. When Sir Edward Watkin became chairman of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS) in 1864, the line was not particularly lucrative as it had no direct connection to London. Watkin was unhappy about transferring traffic to the Great Northern Railway, and when he became chairman of the Metropolitan Railway in 1872, he decided to build a dedicated <b>line</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> MS and Central London.|$|E
5|$|The first local elections, {{based on}} {{universal}} suffrage in Finland were held during 17–28 December 1918 {{and the first}} free Parliamentary election after the Civil War on 3 March 1919. The United States and the United Kingdom recognised Finnish sovereignty on 6–7 May 1919. The Western powers demanded establishment of democratic republics in post-war Europe in order to calm down the widespread revolutionary movements in Europe. The Finnish-Russian Treaty of Tartu signed on 14 October 1920 aimed to stabilize the political relations and settle the border <b>line</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> former Grand Duchy and its mainland.|$|E

5|$|The road {{has long}} {{served as a}} de facto {{cultural}} dividing <b>line</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> predominantly poor black city and its wealthier, predominantly white northern suburbs. The perception of 8Mile as the chief dividing line between racial groups and classes persists, {{in part because the}} suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb remain, on the whole, significantly whiter and more prosperous than the city of Detroit. However, in recent years increasing numbers of whites have moved into Detroit, especially around the downtown area, and other neighborhoods in the region have become more ethnically diverse as well.|$|E
5|$|There are {{types of}} planets {{that do not}} exist in the Solar System: super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, which could be rocky like Earth or a mixture of {{volatiles}} and gas like Neptune—a radius of 1.75 times that of Earth is a possible dividing <b>line</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two types of planet. There are hot Jupiters that orbit very close to their star and may evaporate to become chthonian planets, which are the leftover cores. Another possible type of planet is carbon planets, which form in systems with a higher proportion of carbon than in the Solar System.|$|E
