5000|$|In {{linguistics}} and {{the philosophy}} of mind, a <b>locutionary</b> <b>act</b> is the performance of an utterance, and hence of a speech act. The term equally refers to the surface meaning of an utterance because, according to J. L. Austin's posthumous [...] "How To Do Things With Words", a speech act should be analysed as a <b>locutionary</b> <b>act</b> (i.e. the actual utterance and its ostensible meaning, comprising phonetic, phatic and rhetic acts corresponding to the verbal, syntactic and semantic aspects of any meaningful utterance), {{as well as an}} illocutionary act (the semantic 'illocutionary force' of the utterance, thus its real, intended meaning), and in certain cases a further perlocutionary act (i.e. its actual effect, whether intended or not).|$|E
40|$|J. L. Austin's three-prong {{distinction}} between locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary acts {{is discussed in}} terms of D. Davidson's theory of action. Perlocutionary acts refer to the relation between the utterance and its causal effects on the addressee. In contrast, illocutionary and <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts</b> are alternative descriptions of the utterance. The possibility of conceiving of <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts</b> as expressing propositions under a certain mode of presentation is discussed. Different ways to define illocutionary acts without encroaching on the locutionary or perlocutionary territory are considered. © 2008 The Authors Journal Compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

In this research, An Illocutionary acts study as {{performed}} on the <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts</b> in Gilmore Girls TV Series, the writer makes an analysis on the utterance meaning of the characters from their grammatical form. The writer is curious {{to know about the}} illocutionary acts of the conversation on Gilmore Girls TV Series and also the dominant illocutionary acts that {{can be found on the}} <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts</b> of the data. The scope of this study is the utterances of all the characters on Gilmore Girls TV series episode five ?Cinnamon Wake? and the limitation of this study is on pragmatics. She uses some theories on speech acts as put forward by Langacker and Traugott and Pratt. The writer also uses internet World Wide Web in searching the transcript of Gilmore Girls as her data. The writer uses some steps to make the analysis of this research. First, she divided the data on a scene based on the transcription to make the analysis of the data easier. Second, she analyzed the data based on the <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts</b> to find out the illocutionary <b>acts</b> from the <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts</b> that maybe found. And finally, she put the result on the table so it can easily be interpreted. From the research, the writer found out that most of the characters used imperative sentences in their conversation and the most frequently used illocutionary acts from the imperative sentences are directives illocutionary acts. The second most dominant are declarative sentences with the commisives illocutionary acts performed. The last dominant are interrogatives sentences that performed directives illocutionary acts. Moreover, the writer found that the most important things in finding the correct speech <b>acts</b> (<b>locutionary</b> <b>acts</b> and illocutionary acts) understand what the topic is, who the participant is and the last is where the conversation takes place...|$|R
50|$|The term metalocutionary act {{originated}} as metalocution (Gibbon 1976, 1983) in functional {{descriptions of}} intonation in English and German, by analogy with locution (<b>locutionary</b> <b>act),</b> illocution (illocutionary act) and perlocution (perlocutionary act) in speech act theory. The term metalocutionary act {{has developed a}} more general meaning and may include, for example, quotation acts and comments on preceding speech acts.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{the notion}} of illocutionary act, which {{describes}} the linguistic function of an utterance, a perlocutionary effect is in some sense external to the performance. It may be thought of, in a sense, as {{the effect of the}} illocutionary act via the <b>locutionary</b> <b>act.</b> Therefore, when examining perlocutionary acts, the effect on the hearer or reader is emphasized.|$|E
5000|$|For example, {{the phrase}} [...] "Don't {{go into the}} water" [...] (a <b>locutionary</b> <b>act</b> with {{distinct}} phonetic, syntactic and semantic features) counts as warning to the listener not {{to go into the}} water (an illocutionary act). If the listener heeds the warning the speech-act has been successful in persuading the listener not to go into the water (a perlocutionary act). This taxonomy of speech acts was inherited by John R. Searle, Austin's pupil at Oxford and subsequently an influential exponent of speech act theory.|$|E

Pragmatics concerns with how people use language and consider how the speakers use the language in the social interaction with others. In pragmatics, there is a discussion of speech act theory basically focused on how meaning and action are related to language in communities. The researcher analyzes the types of <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts</b> and illocutionary acts based on utterances of main character in the Robin Hood (2010) movie. In this research study, there are two problems: (1) What are the <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts</b> found in the utterances of the main character in the Robin Hood 2010 movie, (2) What are the illocutionary acts performed in the utterances of the main character in Robin Hood 2010 movie. This study used qualitative approach to identify and examine the Robin Hood movie containing material that consists of types of speech act. The data used in this research were the main character utterances. The steps of analyzing data were classifying and determining the data, analyzing and describing the data, making a table and drawing conclusion. The results show 27 utterances contained speech act in scene 59 until 68 that the mostly produced was declarative sentence by 16 times while, the interrogative used 10 times and the imperative used for eight times for the type of <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts.</b> For illocutionary acts exercitives used for 16 times, expositives used for 10 times, verdictives used for four times, behabitives used for three times and commissives used only once.

It helps to get further information about the importance of understanding the speech act theory and also the next researchers may analyze the objects were not only in the movie but also the other objects...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the research are (1) to identify the types of speech acts in terms of <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts,</b> illocutionary acts and perlocutionary acts found in the three African American women characters and two white women characters’ utterances in Tate Taylor’s The Help and (2) to describe African American women’s obstacles in 1960 s through the speech acts of the three African American women characters and two white women characters portrayed in the film. This research employed the descriptive qualitative method. The data were {{in the form of}} scenes and each scene has a dialogue and context. The source of the data is The Help directed by Tate Taylor and its script. The data were collected by watching the film, reading and checking the script, selecting the data, and recording them into the data sheet. Some steps in analyzing the data were identifying the speech acts, classifying the speech acts based on Austin’s and Searle’s theories, classifying the obstacles faced by the African American women characters based on the speech acts which potentially portrayed the obstacles, applying the data trustworthiness, analyzing the data, and drawing conclusions. The research reveals two findings. The first is that all the three types of speech acts are found in the characters’ utterances. They are <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts,</b> illocutionary acts, and perlocutionary acts. In terms of <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts,</b> the characters employ the phatic acts which deal with grammar, phonological, and syntactic analysis of utterance, phonetic acts which deal with certain sounds or noises, and rhetic acts which are related to the use of sense and reference. In terms of illocutionary acts, the five types of the acts are all found in the characters’ utterances. They are representative, directive, commissive, expressive, and declaration. In terms of perlocutionary acts, the twelve effects are all found in the characters’ utterances and/or facial expressions. The second findings are the obstacles faced by the African American women characters which {{can be found in the}} use of the characters’ speech acts. The obstacles faced by the African American women characters who live in Mississippi, one of the regions in the United States of America, are economic issue, educational issue, racial discrimination, racial segregation, family disruption, and political issue...|$|R
40|$|A psychologically {{plausible}} {{analysis of}} the way we assign illocutionary forces to utterances is formulated using a 'contextualist' analysis of what is said. The account offered makes use of J. L. Austin's distinction between phatic <b>acts</b> (sentence meaning), <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts</b> (contextually determined what is said), illocutionary acts, and perolocutionary acts. In order to avoid the conflation between illocutionary and perlocutionary levels, assertive, directive and commissive illocutionary forces are defined in terms of inferential potential with respect to the common ground. Illocutionary forces are conceived as automatic but optional components of the process of interpretation. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. SCOPUS: ar. jFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} illocutionary acts was {{introduced}} into linguistics by the philosopher John L. Austin in his {{investigation of the}} various aspects of speech acts. In Austin's framework, locution is what was said, illocution is what was meant, and perlocution is what happened as a result. For example, when somebody says [...] "Is there any salt?" [...] at the dinner table, the illocutionary act (the meaning conveyed) is effectively [...] "please give me some salt" [...] even though the <b>locutionary</b> <b>act</b> (the literal sentence) was {{to ask a question}} about the presence of salt. The perlocutionary act (the actual effect), was to cause somebody to offer salt.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{define the}} term [...] "illocutionary act" [...] with {{reference}} to examples, saying for example that any speech act (like stating, asking, commanding, promising, and so on) is an illocutionary act. This approach has generally failed to give any useful hints about what traits and elements make up an illocutionary act; that is, what defines such an act. It is also often emphasised that Austin introduced the illocutionary act {{by means of a}} contrast with other kinds of acts or aspects of acting: the illocutionary act, he says, is an act performed in saying something, as contrasted with a <b>locutionary</b> <b>act,</b> the act of saying something, and also contrasted with a perlocutionary act, an act performed by saying something. Austin, however, eventually abandoned the [...] "in saying" [...] / [...] "by saying" [...] test (1975, 123).|$|E
5000|$|In his paper, Content Ex Machina Bach argues against over-interpreting what he labels the [...] "contextualist platitude" [...] {{which he}} defines as: “Generally what a speaker means in uttering a {{sentence}}, {{even if the}} sentence is devoid of ambiguity, vagueness, or indexicality, goes beyond what the sentence means.” [...] Bach asserts that context does not establish meaning but is merely one of several conversational principles. He states that “context does not determine (in the sense of constitute), but merely enables the hearer to determine (in the sense of ascertain) what the speaker means.” [...] Context provides constraints on what a speaker can reasonably mean and on what a hearer can reasonably interpret a speaker to mean. “contextualist platitude” does not preclude the “older picture of language and communication” and “a fairly standard semantic-pragmatic distinction.” Pragmatic considerations and context do {{not contribute to the}} content of what is said. Bach admits that there is meaning in utterances beyond the semantic content of a sentence, but he maintains that context does not determine speaker meaning but rather constrains how a speaker can expect to be understood and helps the hearer understand what is said. “We need the level of <b>locutionary</b> <b>act</b> and, correlatively, a strict, semantic notion of what is said in order to account for (the content of) what a speaker does in uttering a sentence independently of whatever communicative intention (if any) he has in uttering it and regardless of how the content of that intention may depart from the semantic content of the sentence.” ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} describing the types of speech acts in terms of <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts,</b> illocutionary acts, and perlocutionary acts employed by the main character in a movie entitled State of Play. This research applied a descriptive qualitative method. The existence of quantitative data was used to perform the number of occurrences of each type of speech acts. The primary source {{of this research was}} State of Play movie. Meanwhile books and articles were the secondary sources. The data were in the form of spoken language in scenes and the context of the data was dialogue of the main character and several supporting characters. The researcher was the main instrument and the data sheets were the supporting instrument. Furthermore, simak dan catat (listening, reading and note taking) technique was employed to collect the data. Content analysis was applied as the type of analysis. In increasing the credibility to maintain the data trustworthiness, investigator triangulation was applied. The research reveals three findings. First, the <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts</b> employed by the main character, Cal McAffrey, are declarative, interrogative, and imperative. He employs the declarative form in almost all types and functions of illocutionary acts to deliver, to assert, and to make the information clear related to fact or his opinion for his team or his interviewee. Second, Cal McAffrey employs four types of illocutionary acts. There are representative with 14 functions, directive with 7 functions, commissive with 4 functions, and expressive with 11 functions. He mostly employs the representative to states some facts related to what actually happens when he is working in a newsroom, going out to investigate the case, or interviewing the source. Third, there are twelve types of perlocutionary acts obtained as the effect of what Cal McAffrey has uttered. There are hearer knows something, hearer thinks of something, hearer is doing something, hearer is convinced, hearer feels irritated, hearer feels frightened, hearer is amused, hearer is inspired, hearer is impressed, hearer is attracted, hearer relieves tension, and hearer gives answer. The hearer knows something and the hearer gives answer are the most dominant types. He often reports his investigation, states his opinion, or explains his objective. Thus, the hearer knows and realizes the information in mind. Furthermore, the hearer usually answers him as a reaction to a question or situation in an interview or discussion...|$|R

In pragmatics the study related to the meaning called speech acts because speech acts covers people 2 ̆ 7 s problem to understand the meaning behind the utterance. There are three different levels of speech acts however the writer focus on analyzing the utterance that contain <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts</b> and illocutionary acts in Doraemon comic the 1 st volume because connected with the intended meaning that do not realize by the reader when they read the comic. There are two problems of this study: (1) What are the types of <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts</b> produced by the main character in Doraemon Comic the 1 st Volume? (2) What are the types of illocutionary acts produced by the main character?. This study is a qualitative research analysing the data that are related to the text of Doraemon Comic the 1 st Volume. The writer analyzed the utterances that contain <b>locutionary</b> and illocutionary <b>acts</b> based on Searle 2 ̆ 7 s theory (1976). The writer limited the data collection only chapters 1 - 4 of the comic because the data have been saturated which means the utterances show the same characteristic. Based on the result, there are 48 utterances containing speech acts from chapter one to chapter four (All the Way from a Future World, Prognosis of Doraemon, Transforming Biscuit and Spy Set). The writer found 17 utterances containing illocutionary acts in form of representative, 8 utterances containing commisive, 21 utterances containing directive and 2 utterances containing expressive. In addition, the writer also found 29 declarative sentences used to express gratitude, statement and advice, 7 imperative sentences to express order or request, and 12 interrogative sentences to express question. Meanwhile, the writer does not find the types of illocutionary acts containing declaration. In this study, the most frequent types of illocutionary acts is directives because the speaker wants the listener to do some actions intended by the speaker. In addition, the writer would like to give some suggestions for the future researchers that they use the newest theory to improve their studies. In addition, the writer hopes that the future researchers can use other media, such as: novels, movies, newspapers or advertisements...|$|R
40|$|Indexicals — {{words like}} ‘I’, ‘here’, ‘now’, etc. — are {{expressions}} whose semantic value systematically {{depends upon the}} context of the speech act: ‘I ’ refers to the agent of the speech act (the speaker), ‘here ’ to the place of the speech act, etc. There is, however, something misleading in the definite description ‘the speech act’, which implies unicity. We know, since Austin, that a number of distinct acts are jointly performed in speaking: the phonetic act, the phatic act, the rhetic act, the <b>locutionary</b> <b>act</b> which includes them all, and the illocutionary act one additionally performs in performing the <b>locutionary</b> <b>act.</b> It is true that Austin also speaks of ‘the total speech act’, but if that is what we mean by ‘the speech act’, then it is misleading to talk of ‘{{the context of the}} speech act’, for there may be distinct contexts corresponding to the ‘ancillary acts ’ one can distinguish within the total speech act. In this chapter, I will argue that the notion of ‘context ’ that has {{to be used in the}} study of indexicals is far from univocal. A first distinction has to be made between the real context of speech and the context in which the speech act is supposed to take place — only the latter notion being relevant when it comes to determining the semantic values of indexicals. Second, we need to draw a distinction between the context of the <b>locutionary</b> <b>act</b> and the context of the illocutionary act: contrary to a standard assumption of speech act theory, they can diverge, and their possible divergence explains a number of puzzling phenomena involving indexicals...|$|E

40|$|Language is a {{universal}} human activity. People use language {{in order to be}} able to communicate with one another in everyday life. Therefore, language is said to be a means of communication in the society. People may speak different languages to express their ideas depending on the contents in which they are involved. Since people may speak many languages differently in different social context, we need to understand the pattern of communication. One way to understand the pattern of communication is by analyzing speech acts. In this thesis the writer discusses speech acts in literary work and the literary work which is discussed here is a play. The writer chooses a play because she has some reasons. First, in reading a play, the writer has to be a creative reader to understand the dialogue between the characters. By being creative, she will be able to dig up the content of the play to get as much information as she can. The second, it is not enough to read a play as simply as sequence of statement made by newspaper in the hot-line or statement in the cover of magazines. The reader has to imagine what the dialogue between the characters look like on the stage. The play which is being discussed here is Ile. Ile is considered by some critics as one of the most powerful tragedies yet written in the one-act form. This one-act play was about the journey of Captain Keeney, his wife, and his crew in searching for whale's oil. During his journey, some conflicts happened and at the end of the story the captain's wife lost her mind. Although Ile is only one-act play, it has all elements of a drama and it is well-performed and became O'Neill's first successful play. The author, Eugene O'Neill is known as one of the American greatest playwrights who takes care much about human problems. Based on the above reasons, the writer wants to analyze Eugene O'Neill successful play 'Ile' in order to find out the speech act elements which are used there. As we know, speech acts can be categorized into three parts, they are <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts,</b> illocutionary acts, and perlocutionary acts. Here, the writer wants to find out the three elements above in 'Ile'. To make this study easier, the writer divided the play into three parts: dialogues between minor characters, dialogues between minor and main characters, and dialogues between main characters. The writer applied the elements into each dialogue. <b>Locutionary</b> <b>acts</b> is known as the physical acts of producing an utterance or the acts themselves and in De it is appeared in every dialogue. Illocutionary acts is the acts which are comrnited by producing the utterance and can be divided into severaltypes. Here, the writer used classification of illocutionary acts by Elizabeth C. Traugott and Mary Louis Pratt. There are seven types of illocutionary acts, they are representative, expressive, verdictive, directive, commisive, declarative, and phatic function. All types of illocutionary acts occur in Ile. Representative mostly occured in the dialogue between minor and main characters (69. 88...|$|R
30|$|One of the {{landmarks}} in {{the emergence}} of pragmatic theory, as we know it today, is Austin’s (1962) proposal on certain sentences, which he called performatives. They contrast with other sentences in that a performative utterance (the utterance of a linguistic performative expression) is associated to or intrinsically constitutes the performance of an action. There are three acts related to an utterance and Austin suggests that a speaker can simultaneously perform three acts in issuing an utterance: the <b>locutionary</b> <b>act</b> is the act of saying something meaningful (to which a truth value can be ascribed); the illocutionary act is the act performed in saying something, essentially the performative utterance (the act identified by an explicit performative verb); and the perlocutionary act or effect, which is the act performed by, or the effect emerged as a consequence of saying something.|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} a semantics analysis on speech act used in bemo (Kupang’s public transportation). The {{aim of this}} study are to find out the types and functions of speech act used in bemo. To obtain the data, the writer did observation and took picture to find the speech act used in Kupang’s public transportation. Then the data are analyzed using descriptive qualitative analysis. The result showed that there are three types and six functions of speech act used in bemo. The types of speech act are <b>locutionary</b> <b>act,</b> illocutionary act and perlocutionary act. The example of expression is: santai tapi enak (relax but pleasant). The <b>locutionary</b> <b>act</b> of this expression is used to tell somebody’s feeling in his or her life. The illocutionary act is this expression is used to ask people to enjoy their life. The perlocutionary act of this expression is used to ask people to agree with this expression and enjoy their life too. There are six functions of speech act used in Kupang’s public transportation (bemo), they are representatives, declaratives, commisives, directives, expressives and rogatives functions. One example for the function of speech act used in bemo is nona b cinta lu kuat – kuat (Girl I love you so much). This expression is functioned as a representative speech act because it is used to represent the fact of a man’s feeling to his girlfriend and it is showed the true feeling of a man. Another example is Mantan pacar di larang numpang (Ex girlfriend is prohibited to get into the bemo). The expression is directive because it’s functioned as a warning. The example of commissives is berani komen jantung stop (Dare to comment, heart stop beating). This speech act is used to make a threat against somebody. Based on the result, the writer concluded that there are three types and six functions of speech act used in Bemo (Kupang’s public transportation). ...|$|E
40|$|Speech acts can {{be studied}} in any media, {{including}} TV series. Speech actshave several types. They are locutionary, illocutionary and also perlocutionaryacts. <b>Locutionary</b> <b>act</b> means the exact meaning of the peformed utterance. On the other hand, <b>locutionary</b> <b>act</b> {{can be part of}} illocutionary act if it forces the hearer to understand the hidden meaning or intention of the speaker. Perlocutionary act is the effect of the illocutionary act occured. However, Searle (1969) adds one more act that he argues is also important. That is a propositional act. It is an act of referring and predicating. For academic purposes, the writer is intrigued to study speech acts phenomena through TV series. This study has three problems to solve namely, 1) What are propositional acts found in the utterances of the selected episodes of Glee season 2 ? 2) What are illocutionary acts found in the utterances of the selected episodes of Glee season 2 ? 3) What are perlocutionary acts found in the utterances of the selected episodes of Glee season 2 ? The writer uses a qualitative research method in terms of content analysis.

40|$|ISSN 1476 - 2986 Summary The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop explanation presentation mechanisms for knowledge based systems which enable them to define domain terminology and concepts, narrate events, elucidate plans, processes, or propositions and argue to support a claim or advocate action. This requires the development of devices which select, structure, order and then linguistically realize explanation content as coherent and cohesive English text. With the goal of identifying generic explanation presentation strategies, a wide range of naturally occurring texts were analyzed with respect to their communicative sttucture, function, content and intended effects on the reader. This motivated an integrated theory of communicative acts which characterizes text at the level of rhetorical acts (e. g., describe, define, narrate), illocutionary acts (e. g., inform, request), and <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts</b> (e. g., ask, command). Taken as a whole, the identified communicative acts characterize the structure, content and intended effects of four types of text: description, narration, exposition, argument. These text types have distinct effects such as getting the reader to know about entities, to know about events, to understand plans, processes, or propositions, or to believe propositions or want to perform actions. In addition to identifying the communicative function and effect of text at multiple level...|$|R

By communication people can build a good relationship. In order to make a good communication, they have to understand well what the speaker says. In this case, learning speech act theory is important to cover this problems. Speech acts is an act which can be performed through utterance. In this study, the writer examines the speech act theory in the speech ‘Ganyang Malaysia 2 ̆ 7 which is uttered by Soekarno. There are two research problems of the study, namely: (1) What locutionary and the type of illocutionary acts are produced in Soekarno 2 ̆ 7 s speech ‘Ganyang Malaysia 2 ̆ 7 ?, (2) How are those acts syntactically realized in the speech ‘Ganyang Malaysia 2 ̆ 7 ?. This study was aimed to find out the locutionary, types of illoutionary act, and how those acts are realized in the speech ‘Ganyang Malaysia 2 ̆ 7. This study uses a qualitative approach. It is the descriptive study in textual analysis to analyze the components of speech <b>acts</b> covering the <b>locutionary,</b> illocutionary <b>acts,</b> and how those acts are realized in the speech ‘Ganyang Malaysia 2 ̆ 7 based on Levinson 2 ̆ 7 s theory (1983), Yule 2 ̆ 7 s theory (1996), and Langacker 2 ̆ 7 s theory (1972) in the speech ‘Ganyang Malaysia 2 ̆ 7 which is uttered by Soekarno. This study reveals that two speech <b>acts</b> classification <b>locutionary</b> and types of illocutionary which are declarations, representatives, directives, expressives, commissives and types of sentence which are declarative and imperative are usedin the speech ‘Ganyang Malaysia. 2 ̆ 7 The illocutionary acts is frequently occured inspeech ‘Ganyang Malaysia 2 ̆ 7 is directive because the speaker tries to request thelisteners to do something. Moreover, illocutionary act frequently realized in thedeclarative because the speaker tries to inform something to the listeners throughthe speech. The writer suggests that the next researchers or writers observe perlocutionary act to make the deeper analysis in speech act and find another research object to be analyzed to show that speech act theory can be impelemented in many kinds of media. The writer also suggests the students of Study Program of English apply speech act in real life situation in order to understand well the context of the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s utterances and they should be aware when they talk because every utterance has its own act which can affect the listeners...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the coming out process for transgendered individuals using {{the framework of}} Austin's speech act: the locutionary force, the illocutionary force, and the perlocutionary force. A grounded theory analysis of 43 letters in two different Internet databases revealed similarities and differences in the coming out process for transgendered individuals, compared to {{what we know about}} the process for gay and lesbian people. Similarities were found in all three acts: labels and scripts are used in the locutionary act; confession, education, affirmation and remorse are used as framing strategies in the illocutionary act; and rejection and acknowledgement are addressed in the perlocutionary act. Unique aspects of the coming out process for transgendered individuals include the importance of and reliance on labels in the <b>locutionary</b> <b>act,</b> education in the illocutionary act, and the visualization and cooperation of others in the perlocutionary act. These findings have a number of important practical and theoretical implications for interpersonal relationships and scholarship. Department of Communication StudiesThesis (M. A. ...|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to know what meaning is in the act of "narrative" in {{clinical}} psychology. I then referred to "drama" and traction" to understand it. I defined a modern action that required independence of subject and role as "Action as role taking" and distinguished it from an action in the former modern age and the post modern drama based on mimesis. I named the latter "Action as performance/acting", "Action as performance/acting" is the managing of creating "I" of the fiction by using the word and the gesture that is besides "I" when "I" becomes an unnamed subject by a natural attitude of "I" being ruined. In doing so, many dynamic "I" are rediscovered or generated from the difference between "I" of the fiction and "I" of unnamed subject. One of the conclusions of this paper is that the act of "narrative" is related to "Action as performance/acting" that generates "I" of the dynamic subject and the self...|$|E
40|$|In diesem Aufsatz werden Diskursmarker als Operatoren definiert, die Skopus über Sprechakte nehmen, d. h. Sprechakte modifizieren oder miteinander verknüpfen. Als Sprechakte in diesem Sinne kommen neben perlokutionären und illokutionären auch lokutionäre Akte in Betracht. Die Operation eines Diskursmarkers wird als Zuordnung thematischer Rollen konzeptualisiert. Dafür muss der Diskursmarker zu seinem Operanden im syntaktischen Verhältnis eines Kopfes zu seinem Komplement oder eines Adjunktes zu seinem Wirt stehen, oder er muss ein syntaktisch unabhängiger referentieller Ausdruck sein, der seinen Operanden als Verweisziel nimmt. Linear stehen Diskursmarker typischerweise peripher zu ihren Operanden. In satzförmigen Operanden können adverbiale Diskursmarker auch Binnenstellungen einnehmen. This paper defines {{discourse}} markers as operators {{that take}} scope over speech acts, modifying them or connecting them with each other. Speech acts can be perlocutionary, illocutionary or <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts.</b> The {{operation of a}} discourse marker is conceptualized as the assignment of thematic roles. To make this possible, the discourse marker must stand in a specific syntactic relation to its operand. The marker can be the head and the operand its complement, the marker an adjunct and the operand its host, or the marker can be a syntactically independent referential expression linked to its operand by reference. In linear syntax, discourse markers typically occupy positions at the periphery of their operands. An adverbial discourse marker can also {{be placed in the}} interior of a sentential operand...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims at (1) {{identifying and}} describing {{the types of}} speech acts {{in terms of the}} <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts,</b> the illocutionary acts and the perlocutionary acts delivered by the main character in Ryan Fleck’s Half Nelson outside and inside the school and (2) describing the way the main character copes with the life outside and inside the school. This research employed a descriptive qualitative method. The existence of number was used to reveal the frequencies of the types of speech act. The object of this research was the main character’s utterances in Ryan Fleck’s Half Nelson. The data were in the form of scenes that were analyzed based on Austin’s classification of types of speech act and Searle’s classification of illocutionary acts, and Holmes’s theory of context. The researcher was the primary instrument in this research. The secondary instrument was the data sheet. The data analyses of this research were based on the types of speech acts outside and inside the school. The results show that: first, related to the types of speech act, in terms of <b>locutionary</b> <b>acts,</b> there are three kinds of form, i. e. declarative, interrogative, and imperative. Declarative is the most dominant form used outside and inside the school. It is used in almost all functions of illocutionary act types. Regarding with the illocutionary acts, the main character, Dan, employs four types of act outside the school, i. e. assertive, directive, expressive, and commissive. Assertive holds the highest frequency. In the daily life, he feels that the condition around him is not in line with his opinion. Therefore, he uses his utterances to assert what he believes to be the case. Declaration is not performed by him outside the school since he is as a common person, who has no institutional position. On the other hand, inside the school, directive, assertive, expressive, commissive, and declaration are found. Directive is in the highest frequency because he is a teacher and a basketball coach who performs questioning, requesting, commanding, encouraging, suggesting, etc. Concerning the perlocutionary acts, there are four types of act found outside the school, i. e. get h to know, get h to do something, to express feeling, and get h to expect something. The most-dominant act is get h to know. He often expresses what he believes to others, so that they recognize it. Further, there are five kinds of perlocutionary act found inside the school, i. e. to get h to do something, get h to know, express feeling, praise, and get h to expect something. As a teacher, he employs the acts aimed to get h to do something most, such as questioning, requesting, commanding, etc. Second, he cannot completely split between both lives, outside and inside the school because of the effects of cocaine on his brain. However, he can be honest to tell what he thinks and feels about his life to people he likes or considers them as his ‘friends’ everywhere...|$|R
