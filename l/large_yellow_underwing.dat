25|$|Slugs and snails {{are serious}} pests {{in some parts}} of the world, {{particularly}} in spring when new growth is emerging through the soil. Earwigs can also disfigure the blooms. The other main pests likely to be encountered are aphids (usually on young stems and immature flower buds), red spider mite (causing foliage mottling and discolouration, worse in hot and dry conditions) and capsid bugs (resulting in contortion and holes at growing tips). Diseases affecting dahlias include powdery mildew, grey mould (Botrytis cinerea), verticillium wilt, dahlia smut (Entyloma calendulae f. dahliae), phytophthora and some plant viruses. Dahlias are a source of food for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades, common swift, ghost moth and <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing.</b>|$|E

It was {{introduced}} into British Columbia in about 1982 and has spread southward in the Pacific Northwest. It has recently been reported from Ontario (Crolla 2008). Full synonymy given in Lafontaine. It is a common species but not as abundant as its larger relative <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> (Noctua pronuba).|$|E
5000|$|The genus is {{represented}} by about 60 extant species. Among species found in the wild, those most commonly used in cooking are the garden rhubarb (R. rhabarbarum) and the so-called false rhubarb (R. rhaponticum), which is actually a true rhubarb. [...] The many varieties of cultivated rhubarb more usually grown for eating are recognised as Rheum x hybridum in the Royal Horticultural Society's list of recognised plant names.Rheum species have been recorded as larval food plants for some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail, buff ermine, cabbage moth, <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> and nutmeg moth.|$|E
50|$|This species {{generally}} has {{the appearance of}} a smaller (wingspan 38-48 mm) version of the <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> Noctua pronuba. The forewings are equally variable in pattern and colour, from pale clay to reddish clay, light brown to almost black. The stigmata are dark and outlined with pale yellow. The crosslines are weak. The wavy line flows on to the front edge as a no more than dark brown (never black) stain, which is sometimes extended down the enire wavy line. The hindwings are orange-yellow with a broad black sub-terminal band and central discal lunule (usually absent in Noctua pronuba). It is also similar to the lunar yellow underwing Noctua orbona. In the overall impression a broad-winged species.|$|E
50|$|The foliage is {{sometimes}} eaten by the larvae of Lepidoptera, including emperor moth, willow beauty, white-pinion spotted, common emerald, November moth, pale November moth, mottled pug, green pug, brimstone moth, feathered thorn, brown-tail, yellow-tail, short-cloaked moth, lesser <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> lesser broad-bordered <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> double square-spot, black and brown hairstreaks, hawthorn moth (Scythropia crataegella) and the case-bearer moth Coleophora anatipennella. Dead blackthorn wood provides {{food for the}} caterpillars of the concealer moth Esperia oliviella.|$|R

50|$|It {{is smaller}} in size, with clearer plumage pattern: no {{scalloping}} on breast, underparts brighter <b>yellow,</b> <b>underwing</b> lighter. The {{base of the}} maxilla is dark.|$|R

5000|$|Some insects, notably some Noctuid moths (such as the <b>Large</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>Underwing)</b> {{and some}} tiger moths (such as the Garden Tiger), were {{originally}} theorized {{to defend themselves}} against predation by echolocating bats, both by passively absorbing sound with soft, fur-like body coverings and by actively creating sounds to mimic echoes from other locations or objects (a [...] "phantom echo" [...] that might therefore represent [...] "auditory crypsis"), with alternative theories about interfering with the bats' echolocation ("jamming"). Subsequent research has provided evidence for only two functions of moth sounds, neither of which involve [...] "auditory crypsis:" [...] tiger moth species appear to cluster into two distinct groups: one type produces sounds as acoustic aposematism (warning the bats that the moths are unpalatable) or are acoustic mimics of unpalatable moths, and another type that uses sonar jamming. In the latter type of moth, detailed analyses failed to support a [...] "phantom echo" [...] mechanism underlying sonar jamming but instead pointed towards echo interference.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inflorescence}} is 5 - 25 cm {{long and}} it is composed of flowers gathered in dense cylindrical spikes (up to 50 flowers per spike). These inflorescences are scented and genes underlying eugenol (a volatile scent compound) production {{have been identified in}} Gymnadenia conopsea, Gymnadenia odoratissima and Gymnadenia densiflora [...] The flowers are petiolated, placed in the axils of long bracts and reach on average 8 - 14 cm. They have a distinctive three lobed lip and long spurs. Their light scent is similar to cloves. Their colors vary from white and pink to pink-purple, more rarely white. These flowers bloom in the Summer, from June to July. They are hermaphrodite and pollinated by insects (entomophily), including moths. The species is almost exclusively pollinated by moths (Lepidoptera). The most common pollinators are the small elephant hawk-moth (Deilephila porcellus), hummingbird hawk-moth (Macroglossum stellatarum), silver Y (Autographa gamma), burnished brass (Diachrysia chrysitis) and <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> (Noctua pronuba). Fruit set is high with an average of 73%. The seeds germination is conditioned by the presence of specific fungi.|$|E
50|$|Larvae of the {{foxglove}} pug, a moth, {{consume the}} flowers {{of the common}} foxglove for food. Other species of Lepidoptera eat the leaves, including the lesser <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Noctua janthe, {{the lesser}} broad-bordered <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing,</b> is a moth {{of the family}} Noctuoidea. Some authors {{consider}} Noctua janthe and Noctua janthina {{to be the same}} species. It is found in Europe and North Africa.|$|R
