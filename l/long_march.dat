5|$|After Operation Trio and {{the joint}} Italian-Chetnik offensive, the Partisans formed three more Proletarian Brigades, {{consisting}} mainly of Montenegrins. Operation Trio contributed to {{the decision of the}} Partisan Supreme Headquarters to withdraw to western Bosnia in the Partisan <b>Long</b> <b>March,</b> which commenced in late June 1942.|$|E
5|$|Darah dan Doa was {{released}} in 1950 and distributed by Spectra Film Exchange. It was given the English title The <b>Long</b> <b>March,</b> which the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests is {{a reference to the}} Chinese <b>Long</b> <b>March</b> of 1934. Not long after the film's release, a two-pronged controversy grew around it, which resulted in the film being banned in parts of the country. Members of other military divisions considered the film to put too much emphasis on Siliwangi's role, while members of the general public had difficulty believing that Darul Islam could have betrayed the national cause. Ultimately the film required President Sukarno's permission to be re-released in September 1950, after he received a private screening at the Presidential Palace in mid-1950. However, several scenes had to be cut.|$|E

5|$|After Loetoeng Kasaroeng was released, {{numerous}} domestic {{films were}} made. The second domestic production, Eulis Atjih (1927), {{was directed by}} Krugers and received a wider release. With the release of Lily van Java (Lily of Java) in 1928, ethnic Chinese {{became involved in the}} industry; by 1940 native directors had become common. However, the first truly Indonesian film is considered to be Usmar Ismail's Darah dan Doa (The <b>Long</b> <b>March)</b> in 1950, released after the Dutch recognised Indonesia's independence in 1949.|$|E
5|$|In October 1933 Chiang Kai-shek took {{command of}} nearly 800,000 soldiers, leading the Fifth Encirclement Campaign against the Red Army's force of 150,000 men. By September 1934 the Fifth Encirclement Campaign was largely successful, and Peng's own units {{suffered}} heavy casualties defending the Soviet, shrinking from 35,000 to around 20,000 men. On October 20, 1934 the communists {{broke out of}} Chiang's encirclement and began the <b>Long</b> <b>March.</b> Of the 18,000 men under Peng's command when the March began, only about 3,000 remained when Peng's forces reached their eventual destination in Shaanxi on October 20, 1935.|$|E

Heuveldorp released Loetoeng Kasaroeng, the colony's first domestically produced film, and 1949, when the Dutch formally recognised Indonesia's sovereignty after a four-year revolution, leaving the Dutch East Indies defunct. Thirteen directors active in the Indies continued to direct films after 1950, including Usmar Ismail: his 1950 film Darah dan Doa (The <b>Long</b> <b>March)</b> is generally considered the first truly Indonesian film.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>Long</b> <b>March</b> Zhu and Zhou Enlai {{organized}} certain {{battles in}} tandem. There were few positive effects since {{the real power}} was {{in the hands of}} Bo Gu and Otto Braun. In the Zunyi Conference, Zhu supported Mao Zedong’s criticisms of Bo and Braun. After the conference, Zhu cooperated with Mao and Zhou on military affairs. In July 1935 Zhu and Liu Bocheng were with the Fourth Red Army while Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai with the First Red Army. When separation between the two divisions occurred, Zhu was forced by Zhang Guotao, the leader of Fourth Red Army, to go south. The Fourth Red Army barely survived the retreat through Sichuan Province. Arriving in Yan'an, Zhu directed the reconstruction of the Red Army under the political guidance of Mao.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 Zhu and Mao {{were forced}} to flee Jinggangshan to Ruijin {{following}} Kuomintang military pressure. Here they formed the Jiangxi Soviet, which would eventually grow to cover some 30,000 square kilometers (11,584 square miles) and include some three million people. In 1931 Zhu was appointed leader of the Red Army in Ruijin by the CPC leadership. He successfully led a conventional military force against the Kuomintang in the lead-up to the Fourth Counter Encirclement Campaign; However, {{he was not able}} to do the same during the Fifth Counter Encirclement Campaign and the CPC fled. Zhu helped form the 1934 break-out that began the <b>Long</b> <b>March.</b>|$|E

5|$|NigComSat-1, a Nigerian {{satellite}} {{built in}} 2004, was Nigeria's third satellite and Africa's first communication satellite. It was launched on 13 May 2007, aboard a Chinese <b>Long</b> <b>March</b> 3B carrier rocket, from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China. The spacecraft was operated by NigComSat and the Nigerian Space Agency, NASRDA. On 11 November 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after {{running out of}} power because of an anomaly in its solar array. It {{was based on the}} Chinese DFH-4 satellite bus, and carries a variety of transponders: 4 C-band; 14 Ku-band; 8 Ka-band; and 2 L-band. It was designed to provide coverage to many parts of Africa, and the Ka-band transponders would also cover Italy.|$|E
5|$|The <b>long</b> <b>march</b> from Seminary Ridge {{had left}} {{some of the}} Southern units disorganized, and their commanders paused {{momentarily}} at Plum Run to reorganize. Hancock led the II Corps brigade of Col. George L. Willard to meet Barksdale's brigade as it moved toward the ridge. Willard's New Yorkers drove the Mississippians back to Emmitsburg Road. Barksdale was wounded in his left knee, followed by a cannonball to his left foot, and finally was hit by another bullet to his chest, knocking him off his horse. His troops were forced to leave him for dead on the field, and he died the next morning in a Union field hospital. Willard was also killed, and Confederate guns drove back Willard's men in turn.|$|E
5|$|As a {{personal}} cavalry escort, Constantius provided Julian with 200 scholares, a regiment of cataphractarii (heavily armoured cavalry) and some mounted archers (in total 360 men). En route to Gaul from Milan, at Taurini (Turin), {{he received the}} calamitous news that Cologne, Rome's most important city and military fortress on the Rhine, had fallen to the Franks. He spent the winter of 355/356 with his escorting troops at Vienna (Vienne), not far South of Lugdunum (Lyons). For the 356 campaigning season, Julian's first task was to link up with the main Gaul comitatus, which had wintered at Remi (Reims) {{under the command of}} the magister equitum, Ursicinus' recently appointed successor, Marcellus. This involved a <b>long</b> <b>march</b> through country swarming with Alamanni raiding bands, many of which were as large or larger than Julian's own escort and expert at ambuscades. On the way, Julian surprised and drove off a large barbarian force that had surrounded Augustodunum (Autun) and defeated a raiding band in the Morvan wilderness.|$|E

5|$|Harold's defeat was {{probably}} due to several circumstances. One was the need to defend against two almost simultaneous invasions. The fact that Harold had dismissed his forces in southern England on 8 September {{also contributed to the}} defeat. Many historians fault Harold for hurrying south and not gathering more forces before confronting William at Hastings, although {{it is not clear that}} the English forces were insufficient to deal with William's forces. Against these arguments for an exhausted English army, the length of the battle, which lasted an entire day, shows that the English forces were not tired by their <b>long</b> <b>march.</b> Tied in with the speed of Harold's advance to Hastings is the possibility Harold may not have trusted Earls Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria once their enemy Tostig had been defeated, and declined to bring them and their forces south. Modern historians have pointed out that one reason for Harold's rush to battle was to contain William's depredations and keep him from breaking free of his beachhead.|$|E
5|$|Operation Trio {{coincided with}} {{and contributed to}} the {{polarisation}} of the almost exclusively Serb rebels in eastern Bosnia into two groups: the Serb-chauvinist Chetniks and the multi-ethnic and communist-led Partisans. Encouraged by Chetnik propaganda against Croats and Bosnian Muslims and repelled by the sectarian left-wing policies and actions of the communists, many Serb peasant fighters were swayed to the Chetnik cause. Violent coups occurred against the communist leadership of {{all but one of the}} Partisan detachments in eastern Bosnia, and these detachments effectively defected to the Chetniks. Most of the surviving communist fighters from these detachments rejoined the Partisan forces, and many withdrew with Tito to western Bosnia during the Partisan <b>Long</b> <b>March.</b> Within a few weeks of the end of Operation Trio only 600 Partisan fighters were left in eastern Bosnia, comprising the Group of Shock Battalions and the Birač Partisan Detachment. All these forces sought refuge in the Birač region. The Chetnik movement in eastern Bosnia, at best a confederacy of local warlords, was strengthened by mass defections from the Partisans. For a time they ruled large parts of the region, after making accommodations with the Ustaše regime in May and June 1942.|$|E
5|$|The weaker {{members of}} the party—Arnold Spencer-Smith and Mackintosh himself—were by this time showing signs of {{physical}} breakdown, as the <b>long</b> <b>march</b> south began from Bluff Depot towards Mount Hope at 83°30S, where the final depot was to be laid. The party was reduced to six when three men were forced to turn back because of a Primus stove failure. With Mackintosh and Joyce in the final party were Spencer-Smith, Ernest Wild (younger brother of Frank), Dick Richards and Victor Hayward. With four dogs they trekked southward, increasingly afflicted by frostbite, snow blindness and, eventually, scurvy. Spencer-Smith collapsed, and thereafter had to be carried on the sledge. Mackintosh, barely able to walk, fought on until the final depot was laid at Mount Hope. On the homeward journey the effective leadership of the party fell increasingly to Joyce, as Mackintosh's condition deteriorated until, like Spencer-Smith, {{he had to be}} carried on the sledge. The journey became a protracted struggle which eventually cost the life of Spencer-Smith and took the others to the limits of their endurance. Mackintosh suffered further physical and mental collapse, and had to be left in the tent while Joyce, himself suffering from severe snow blindness, led the rest to the safety of Hut Point. He and Ernest Wild then returned for Mackintosh, and the five survivors were all back at Hut Point on 18 March 1916.|$|E

60|$|The British {{army had}} {{suffered}} but slight loss in battle, but the <b>long</b> <b>marches,</b> the terribly wet weather, {{and the effect}} of climate told heavily upon them, and upwards of 4,000 men were, in a short time, in hospital.|$|R
5|$|They reached Laodicea on the Lycus {{early in}} January 1148, {{around the same}} time Otto of Freising's army had been {{destroyed}} in the same area. Resuming the march, the vanguard under Amadeus of Savoy became separated {{from the rest of the}} army at Mount Cadmus, and Louis’ troops suffered heavy losses from the Turks. Louis himself, according to Odo of Deuil, climbed a rock and was ignored by the Turks, who did not recognize him. The Turks did not bother to attack further and the French marched on to Adalia, continually harassed from afar by the Turks, who had also burned the land to prevent the French from replenishing their food, both for themselves and their horses. Louis no longer wanted to continue by land, and it was decided to gather a fleet at Adalia and sail for Antioch. After being delayed for a month by storms, most of the promised ships did not arrive at all. Louis and his associates claimed the ships for themselves, while the rest of the army had to resume the <b>long</b> <b>march</b> to Antioch. The army was almost entirely destroyed, either by the Turks or by sickness.|$|E
5|$|Peng {{was one of}} {{the most}} senior generals who defended the Jiangxi Soviet from Chiang's {{attempts}} to capture it, and his successes were rivaled only by Lin Biao. Peng participated in the <b>Long</b> <b>March,</b> and supported Mao Zedong at the Zunyi Conference, which was critical to Mao's rise to power. During the 1937–1945 Second Sino-Japanese War, Peng {{was one of the}} strongest supporters of pursuing a ceasefire with the Kuomintang in order to concentrate China's collective resources on resisting the Japanese Empire. Peng was the senior commander in the combined Kuomintang-Communist efforts to resist the Japanese occupation of Shanxi in 1937; and, by 1938, was in command of 2/3 of the Eighth Route Army. In 1940, Peng conducted the Hundred Regiments Offensive, a massive Communist effort to disrupt Japanese logistical networks across northern China. The Hundred Regiments Offensive was modestly successful, but political disputes within the Communist Party led to Peng being recalled to Yan'an, and he spent the rest of the war without an active command. After the Japanese surrendered, in 1945, Peng was given command of Communist forces in Northwest China. He was the most senior commander responsible for defending the Communist leadership in Shaanxi from Kuomintang forces, saving Mao from being captured at least once. Peng eventually defeated the Kuomintang in Northwest China, captured huge amounts of military supplies, and actively incorporated the huge area, including Xinjiang, into the People's Republic of China.|$|E
25|$|Hu {{was one of}} the {{youngest}} veterans of the <b>Long</b> <b>March.</b> Once Mao was removed from power, shortly before the beginning of the Fourth Encirclement Campaign, Mao's supporters were persecuted, and Hu Yaobang was sentenced to death. Just before the beginning of the <b>Long</b> <b>March,</b> he and others {{were on their way to}} be beheaded. However, a powerful local communist commander named Tan Yubao (谭余保, 1899 – 10 January 1980) intervened at the last minute, saving Hu's life. Because of Hu's support of Mao, he was deemed unreliable and ordered to join the <b>Long</b> <b>March</b> so that he could be placed under surveillance.|$|E
