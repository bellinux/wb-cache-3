5|$|Quintilian {{provides}} the most extensive theory of primary education in Latin literature. According to Quintilian, each child has in-born ingenium, a talent for <b>learning</b> <b>or</b> linguistic intelligence that {{is ready to be}} cultivated and sharpened, as evidenced by the young child's ability to memorize and imitate. The child incapable of learning was rare. To Quintilian, ingenium represented a potential best realized in the social setting of school, and he argued against homeschooling. He also recognized the importance of play in child development, and disapproved of corporal punishment because it discouraged love of learning—in contrast to the practice in most Roman primary schools of routinely striking children with a cane (ferula) or birch rod for being slow or disruptive.|$|E
25|$|Jensen claimed, on {{the basis}} of his research, that general {{cognitive}} ability is essentially an inherited trait, determined predominantly by genetic factors rather than by environmental conditions. He also contended that while associative <b>learning,</b> <b>or</b> memorizing ability, is equally distributed among the races, conceptual <b>learning,</b> <b>or</b> synthesizing ability, occurs with significantly greater frequency in whites than in non-whites.|$|E

To combat high youth unemployment and poor outcomes for those {{with lower levels of}} education, the Australian government introduced the <b>Learn</b> <b>or</b> Earn program. Under <b>Learn</b> <b>or</b> Earn, young people who have not finished Year 12 must be in education or training to receive income support payments. This study highlights the human impact and common experience of the <b>Learn</b> <b>or</b> Earn initiative and lets young people themselves tell their own experience of <b>Learn</b> <b>or</b> Earn...|$|R

25|$|To fully engage and {{challenge}} the learner, {{the task and}} learning environment should reflect {{the complexity of the}} environment that the learner should be able to function in at the end of learning.

25|$|Although these {{findings}} {{have contributed to}} understanding how sexual arousal can differentiate between genders and sexual orientations, {{it is still a}} matter of debate whether these results reflect differences which are the result of social <b>learning</b> <b>or</b> genetic or biological factors. Further studies are needed to clarify how much of people's reactions to sexual stimuli of their preferred gender are due to learned or innate factors.|$|E
25|$|Models {{that make}} use of these {{probabilistic}} methods {{have been able to}} merge the previously dichotomous language acquisition perspectives of social theories that emphasize the importance of learning speaker intentions and statistical and associative theories that rely on cross-situational contexts into a single joint-inference problem. This approach has led to important results in explaining acquisition phenomena such as mutual exclusivity, one-trial <b>learning</b> <b>or</b> fast mapping, and the use of social intentions.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{education}} in India is often criticised for being based on rote learning rather than problem solving.

BusinessWeek criticises the Indian curriculum, saying it revolves around rote learning and ExpressIndia suggests that students are focused on cramming.|$|E

25|$|Macroeconomic cost {{estimates}} made by Fisher et al.

According to Fisher et al. (2007), relaxation of {{some or all}} these assumptions would lead to an appreciable increase in {{cost estimates}}. On the other hand, IPCC (2007b:8) noted that cost estimates could be reduced by allowing for accelerated technological <b>learning,</b> <b>or</b> the possible use of carbon tax/emission permit revenues to reform national tax systems.|$|E
25|$|Selecting a {{different}} test usually identifies {{a different}} list of significant genes since each test operates under a {{specific set of}} assumptions, and places a different emphasis on certain features in the data. Many tests begin with the assumption of a normal distribution in the data, because that seems like a sensible starting point and often produces results that appear more significant. Some tests consider the joint distribution of all gene observations to estimate general variability in measurements, while others look at each gene in isolation. Many modern microarray analysis techniques involve bootstrapping (statistics), machine <b>learning</b> <b>or</b> Monte Carlo methods.|$|E
25|$|Organizational memory {{can only}} be applied {{if it can be}} accessed. To make use of it, {{organizations}} must have effective retrieval systems for their archives and good memory recall among the individuals that make up the organization. Its importance to an organization depends upon how well individuals can apply it, a discipline known as experiential <b>learning</b> <b>or</b> evidence-based practice. In the case of individuals' memories, organizational memory's veracity is invariably compromised by the inherent limitations of human memory. Individuals' reluctance to admit to mistakes and difficulties compounds the problem. The actively encouraged flexible labor market has imposed an Alzheimer's-like corporate amnesia on organizations that creates an inability to benefit from hindsight.|$|E
