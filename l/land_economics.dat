The system is meant to redistribute unearned economic rent to the public and improve land use.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{integrated}} framework to analyze jointly two key issues: {{the emergence of}} global imbalances and the precautionary motive for accumulating reserves. Standard models of general equilibrium would predict modest current account surpluses in the emerging markets if they face higher risk than the US itself. But, with pronounced Loss Aversion in emerging markets, their precautionary savings can generate substantial global imbalances, especially {{if there is an}} inefficient supply of global insurance. In principle, lower real interest rates will ensure that aggregate demand equals supply at a global level (though the required real interest may be negative). While a precautionary savings glut appears to be a temporary phenomenon, a process of correction triggered by a Sudden Stop in capital flows to the United States might lead to a hard <b>landing.</b> <b>Economics,</b> WP- 593; D 51, D 52, E 12, E 13, E 21, E 44, F 32. stochastic dynamic general equilibrium, loss aversion, liquidity trap...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} address the total and capital return {{performance}} of a major agricultural area and compare these returns {{on the basis of}} both location of land and land use. The comparison will be used to determine if location or actual land use has a greater influence on rural property capital returns. This performance analysis is based on over 35, 000 rural sales transactions. These transactions cover all market based rural property transactions in New South Wales, Australia for the period January 1990 to December 2008. Correlation analysis and investment performance analysis has also been carried out to determine the possible relationships between location and land use and subsequent changes in rural land capital values.
