However, the significant cost of the instruments is a disincentive for their wide application in food control laboratories. Therefore, a low-cost alternative optical biosensor (Spreeta¿, Texas Instruments, Attleboro, MA) was built into an affordable liquid handling system. Using this prototype biosensor, an inhibition immunoassay for bovine ¿-casein was evaluated for the detection of cow's milk in ewe's and goat's milk and for the detection of <b>bovine</b> <b>rennet</b> whey powder in milk powder. Comparable sensitivities were obtained for both adulterants in the Spreeta-based prototype biosensor and a Biacore 3000 instrument. The limit of detection for cow's milk was 0. 17 % (v/v) and <b>bovine</b> <b>rennet</b> whey powder could be detected in milk powder above 1 % (w/w).

40|$|Extracts of milk coagulating enzymes were obtained, {{adult bovine}} from the abomasums of pasture fed cattle and lamb rennet from the abomasums of {{partially}} milk fed lambs slaughtered {{between three and}} six months of age. Both rennets were, {{in the presence of}} sodium chloride, most stable at 10 °C or lower at pH 4. 7 for adult bovine and pH 4. 1 for lamb. Heat treatment in a sodium chlorine solution (200 mg/ml) at 68 °C for 60 minutes destroyed less than 35 % of the activity of each rennet. Under the same conditions calf rennet was completely inactivated. The cheesemaking properties of adult <b>bovine</b> and lamb <b>rennets</b> were compared with calf <b>rennet.</b> Adult <b>bovine</b> and calf <b>rennets</b> responded similarly to changes of pH however lamb rennet appeared less active than calf rennet at higher pH's when measured in caseinate solution but appeared more active than calf rennet when measured in milk by a curd tension method. The optimum temperature for milk coagulating activity was 40 °C for adult <b>bovine</b> and calf <b>rennets</b> but only 30 °C for lamb rennet when measured in caseinate solution. The curd tension of milk coagulated with the three rennets increased with time but both adult <b>bovine</b> and lamb <b>rennets</b> appeared more sensitive to milk calcium levels than calf rennet. Whole casein, αs-, β- and k-caseins were hydrolysed in a similar manner by the three <b>rennets.</b> Adult <b>bovine</b> <b>rennet</b> was the most proteolytic on whole and β- caseins while calf rennet hydrolysed αs- and k-caseins more rapidly than the other rennets. Two pepsins, of similar amino acid compositions, were isolated, one from adult <b>bovine</b> <b>rennet</b> and one from lamb rennet which also contained a rennin. All three enzymes were purified so that lamb rennin and pepsin each produced only a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but the adult bovine pepsin produced two bands and appeared to be heterogeneous. Cheese made with adult bovine, lamb or a 50 / 50 mixture of calf-adult <b>bovine</b> <b>rennets</b> were compared with cheese made with calf rennet and found to be similar in manufacturing characteristics, flavour and body after three and six months storage at 6 or 13 °C. Polyacrylaride gel electrophoretograms of these cheese after one to twelve months storage at 6 °C showed that the milk coagulant had no effect on the casein degradation products produced in the cheese although the rate of degradation varied slightly. Perchloric acid was found to be a good protein precipitant for quenching casein-rennet reactions and was utilize in a ethod which was developed for assaying milk coagulating activity. Rennet was added to sodium caseinate solution and one minute later the reaction quenched with perchloric acid. The quantity of peptides hydrolysed from the casein was measured at 217 nm and was directly proportional to rennet activity over a limited range of activity. A method for removing mucoproteins, the major impurity in rennet, was developed and a commercial scale plant commissioned. A diethylaminoethyl cellulose based resin, equilibrated with a citrate buffer, retained the rennet enzymes while the mucoproteins passed through uninhibited. The enzymes were eluted with the same buffer made 1. 0 M with sodium chloride. The eluent was more active than the original rennet, was crystal clear in appearance and remained so during twelve months storage when normally mucoproteins would have precipitated out of solution to form a cloud in the rennet...|$|R

It does not coagulate easily and <b>bovine</b> <b>rennet</b> fails to coagulate the milk effectively. In camel herding communities camel milk cheeses use spontaneous fermentation, or lactic fermentation to achieve a sour curd. In camel farms in Sudan, the Rashaida tribe use this method to store surplus milk in the rainy season, pulverising the dried curds and adding water for consumption in the dry season. In Mongolia camel milk is consumed as a product at various stages of the curd-making process. Recent advances in cheese making technology have made it possible to coagulate camel milk with a vegetable rennet and camel rennet.|$|R

The fractionated enzymes were Sephadex G- 100 fractions {{of the commercial}} enzymes. Milk clotting activity of each fraction was tested using Berridge substrate. All fractions from each preparation which had milk clotting activity as measured with the Formagraph were collected and pooled. These samples and the original enzyme preparations were used to coagulate milk. Percent of protein lost in whey was determined by Kjeldahl. Coagulation was followed using a spectrophotometer monitoring changes in apparent absorbance at 600 nm. Curd protein yields using the five original enzyme preparations were compared with each other. Also, protein lost in whey from the five original preparations were compared with those using the isolated fraction. There {{was a significant difference}} among the original enzymes in protein lost in whey. There were also significant differences between some of the commercial enzyme preparations and their fractionated preparations. Gel filtration through Sephadex G- 100 improved <b>bovine</b> <b>rennet</b> and calf rennet/porcine pepsin mixture more than the other three enzyme preparations.

25|$|Rennet is {{a mixture}} of enzymes used to {{coagulate}} milk into cheese. Originally it was available only from the fourth stomach of calves, and was scarce and expensive, or was available from microbial sources, which often produced unpleasant tastes. Genetic engineering made it possible to extract rennet-producing genes from animal stomachs and insert them into bacteria, fungi or yeasts to make them produce chymosin, the key enzyme. The modified microorganism is killed after fermentation. Chymosin is isolated from the fermentation broth, so that the Fermentation-Produced Chymosin (FPC) used by cheese producers has an amino acid sequence that is identical to <b>bovine</b> <b>rennet.</b> The majority of the applied chymosin is retained in the whey.

The results obtained indicated {{that the use of}} rennet paste caused greater lipolysis and increased, mostly, the short-chain free fatty acid (FFA) content. The model systems made with whole goat's milk using rennet paste and commercial rennet mixture exhibited a higher FFA content than did the rennet paste-free controls (31, 600 vs. 25, 600 μmol/kg cheese). For the pilot cheeses made with <b>bovine</b> <b>rennet</b> and rennet paste mixture, the increase in FFA level after 45 days of ripening compared with the cheeses prepared only with commercial rennet was as much as 6600 (μmol/kg cheese) and the increase in the butyric acid content was also 1650 (μmol/kg cheese). Moreover, after 15 days of ripening, industrially prepared cheeses made with rennet paste exhibited greater levels of FFA than did the cheeses made with commercial rennet (11, 500 μmol/kg at 45 days of ripening). Their flavour was stronger and the organoleptic characteristics were better accepted, which implies less ripening time for commercial cheese manufacture. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of the use of saline water on morphophysiological responses and sensory analysis of ‘Boa noite’ plants (Catharanthus roseus) in soil fertilized with bovine biofertilizer. A completely randomized design was used in the split plot arrangement, the plots being formed by the five irrigation water salinity levels (0. 5, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10 dS m- 1), and the subplots by two frequencies of application of the 150 mL pot- 1 of <b>liquid</b> <b>bovine</b> biofertilizer (divided into one and five times), with five replicates. The analysed variables were: leaf gas exchange relative chlorophyll index, biometry, dry matter (leaf, stems, flowers and roots) and sensory analysis (general appearance and buyers’ preference). Quantitative (growth and physiological) and qualitative (sensory analysis) responses show that Catharanthus roseus plants can be produced using saline water at the level of 2. 5 dS m- 1, and the plants of this treatment were preferred by the judges in sensory analysis. Biofertilizer application frequency did not attenuate the effects of salinity. Therefore, the <b>liquid</b> <b>bovine</b> biofertilizer can be applied all at once, reducing costs...|$|R
40|$|A chromatographic study, {{based on}} reversed-phase, size {{exclusion}} and hydrophobic interaction chromatography, {{was performed to}} evaluate the influence of weight of the cheese and type of rennet used {{on the evolution of}} soluble nitrogen in "Canestrato Pugliese", a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) hard cheese produced in Southern Italy from sheep milk. The weight of the cheese had only a quantitative influence, with higher amounts of soluble nitrogen in the smaller cheeses. The influence of the rennet was both quantitative and qualitative, probably due to the different chymosin/pepsin ratios. More soluble nitrogen was found in cheeses obtained with lamb rennet and significant differences were observed among the chromatographic profiles. Size exclusion chromatography revealed a significant accumulation of medium- molecular-weight peptides during ripening in the lamb rennet cheeses, whereas a faster formation of low-molecular-weight peptides was found in those produced with <b>bovine</b> <b>rennet.</b> The most distinctive peptide fraction (about 4 KD), recovered and analysed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, revealed the presence of further qualitative differences, which were confirmed by reversed phase chromatography and free amino acid analysis.

40|$|Enzymic milk {{coagulation}} was {{monitored by measuring}} changes in curd firmness and apparent absorbance of undiluted milk. Detection of coagulation, visually or rheologically, occurred after the milk changes from a system of aggregating particles to an extended space network. This change was observed as a shoulder in apparent absorbance plots and coagulation time {{was defined as the}} critical point in the aggregation process analogously to non-linear condensation polymerization reactions. It corresponds to the inflexion point during the period when apparent absorbance was rapidly increasing and can be calculated by fitting curd firmness data to an exponential equation. Addition of calcium chloride to milk reduced coagulation time with a minimum occurring at. 05 M calcium. Also, curd firmness increased with a maximum at. 02 M calcium. It appears that calcium affects all stages of coagulation: proteolysis, micelle aggregation, and gelation. When bulk culture media was added to milk, the pH of the media had a greater effect on coagulation time than did presence of phosphate in the media. Non-specific proteolytic activity of milk coagulants affects the initial rate of curd firming but not the maximum firmness. The more proteolytic the enzyme the slower the curd firming rate. This can be used to rapidly assay for pepsin content of <b>bovine</b> <b>rennets...</b>|$|R

The experiment was performed in the Department of Soil and Rural Agricultural Engineering of the Center of Agricultural Sciences (CCA), Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB), from August to October 2008. The experimental design was that of randomized blocks in split plots, where the plots were the levels of liquid biofertilizer at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % by volume of 10 % of the total substratum volume (250 mL), the subplots were the five plant evaluation periods (45, 60, 75, 90 and 105 days after the sowing); the experiment was performed in quadruplicate. The application of biofertilizer was made 30 days before sowing, followed by a washing of the soil (two days after of biofertilizer application); a second application of the biofertilizer was made 48 hours before sowing, followed by a soil washing similar to that of the first application. Non-saline water was used for irrigation, adding the water equivalent to the evapotranspiration rate per 24 hours, based on weighing the pots. The increased level of organic matter input provided greater plant height and stem diameter, as well as greater leaf number, foliar area and total dry matter, surpassing the control by 134. 78; 114. 72; 127. 35; 416. 54 and 107. 97 %, respectively...|$|R

Purification to homogeneity of the proteinase was performed by carboxymethyl cellulose, CM Sephadex G- 50, and Sephacryl S- 200 column chromatographies. The purified enzyme was a chymotrypsinlike serine proteinase, {{as indicated by the}} strong inhibitory activities of diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, L- 1 -tosylamido- 2 -phenylethylchloromethyl ketone, and chymostatin and good kinetic constants for a synthetic substrate, Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-MCA. The enzyme had a pI of 8. 4, a pH optimum of 9. 0, and a molecular weight of 34, 000. Skin constituents such as stratum corneum and nail, but not hair, were easily digested by this enzyme.

The pH was adjusted to 5. 9 with. lN hydrochloric acid. Proteases derived from Mucor pusillus var Lindt, Mucor Miehei and Endothia parasitica, as well as <b>rennet,</b> procine and <b>bovine</b> pepsins were used at recommended levels to set milk for Cheddar cheese manufacture. Whey samples from each lot were taken at draining and adjusted to pH 5. 2, 5. 6, 6. 0, 6. 2, 6. 6 and 7. 0 prior to being heated to 68. 3 C, 71. 1 C and 73. 9 C for. 25,. 5, 1, 5, and 10 minutes. Enzyme activities were assayed before and after heating. Mucor miehei protease was the most heat stable at all pH values followed by Mucor pusillus protease, <b>rennet,</b> <b>bovine</b> pepsin, E. parasitica protease and porcine pepsin. The heat stability of all enzymes except E. parasitica protease decreased with increasing pH, E. parasitica protease decreased with decreasing pH.

40|$|Hebeloma crustuliniforme {{produced}} an extracellular acid proteinase in a <b>liquid</b> medium containing <b>bovine</b> serum albumin {{as the sole}} nitrogen source. The proteinase was purified 26 -fold with 20 % activity recovery and was shown to have a molecular weight of 37, 800 (as indicated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and an isoelectric point of 4. 8 ± 0. 2. The enzyme was most active at 50 °C and pH 2. 5 against bovine serum albumin and was stable {{in the absence of}} substrates at temperatures up to 45 °C and pHs between 2. 0 and 5. 0. Pepstatin A, diazoacetyl-dl-norleucine methylester, metallic ions Fe 2 + and Fe 3 +, and phenolic acids severely inhibited the enzyme activity, while antipain, leupeptin, N-α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and trypsin inhibitor inhibited the activity moderately.

40|$|In {{response}} to various extracellular signals, the morphology {{of the human}} fungal pathogen Candida albicans switches from yeast to hypha form. Here, we report that GPR 1 encoding a putative G-protein-coupled receptor and GPA 2 encoding a Gα subunit are required for hypha formation and morphogenesis in C. albicans. Mutants lacking Gpr 1 (gpr 1 /gpr 1) or Gpa 2 (gpa 2 /gpa 2) are defective in hypha formation and morphogenesis on solid hypha-inducing media. These phenotypic defects in solid cultures are suppressed by exogenously added dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (dibutyryl-cAMP). Biochemical studies also reveal that GPR 1 and GPA 2 are required for a glucose-dependent increase in cellular cAMP. An epistasis analysis indicates that Gpr 1 functions upstream of Gpa 2 in the same signaling pathway, and a two-hybrid assay reveals that the carboxyl-terminal tail of Gpr 1 interacts with Gpa 2. Moreover, expression levels of HWP 1 and ECE 1, which are cAMP-dependent hypha-specific genes, are reduced in both mutant strains. These findings support a model that Gpr 1, as well as Gpa 2, regulates hypha formation and morphogenesis in a cAMP-dependent manner. In contrast, GPR 1 and GPA 2 are not required for hypha formation in <b>liquid</b> fetal <b>bovine</b> serum (FBS) medium. Furthermore, the gpr 1 and the gpa 2 mutant strains are fully virulent in a mouse infection. These findings suggest that Gpr 1 and Gpa 2 {{are involved in the}} glucose-sensing machinery that regulates morphogenesis and hypha formation in solid media via a cAMP-dependent mechanism, but they are not required for hypha formation in liquid medium or during invasive candidiasis...|$|R

The development of nanoscale ultrasound contrast agents can enter small capillaries of tissues and {{aid in the}} detection of diseased states. However, current nano-formulations are flushed from the body over {{a short period of}} time. We developed a nanoscale ultrasound contrast agent with increased circulation time to allow for better detection of diseased states in the microvasculature of the body. Characterization (zeta potential, size, echogenicity and stability) and pharmacokinetic analysis were conducted on three nanoscale formulations: 1) <b>Liquid</b> based <b>Bovine</b> Serum Albumin (BSA) - Perfluropentane (PFP), 2) Gas based Lipid -L 61 Pluronic, and 3) Gas based L 61 -Pluronic with Polyethylene Glycol (PEG). Characterization was conducted using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA). Echogenicity testing was performed using ultrasound imaging (Vevo 2100) in vitro with a tissue phantom. The concentration, frequency response, and bubble stability were evaluated. The BSA-PFP, L 61, and PEG L 61 formulations had mean sizes of approximately 300 nm, 250 nm, and 330 nm respectively (n = 6). Images taken on the high frequency ultrasound system revealed that the L 61 nanobubbles had higher signal intensity. Stability of the different formulations was measured over 2 hours. Nanobubble intensities decreased overtime, except the BSA-PFP bubbles, most likely due to being liquid-derived. Future in vivo studies will be conducted for circulation times in an animal model. Utilization of these formulations could lead to targeting of proteins in the body through modified nanobubble formulations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The study {{deals with}} the direct {{manufacturing}} of hydroxyapatite scaffolds using selective polymerization of the slurry <b>liquid</b> phase. The <b>bovine</b> hydroxyapatite has great similarity with the human bone structure, making it able for a direct connection with the bone tissues. This study aims to obtain scaffolds using a new technique of rapid prototyping, obtained by polymerization of acrylic resin (liquid phase of slurry) by ultraviolet light present {{in a range of}} the band spectrum emitted by the blue laser light. Sub-micrometer hydroxyapatite was obtained by the calcination and grinding of bovine bone in a vibratory mill. Mixtures of hydroxyapatite and resin were prototyped in three-dimensional pieces and sintered afterword and subjected to blue laser emission path directed in a CNC equipment. Grounded particles obtained in the grinding vibratory mill, with equivalent diameter of 0. 35 microns, were reactive enough to compensate the low green densification bellow 50 vol%. Polymerization tests realized indicated that the incidence of the laser with fluency of 170 mW. s/mm 2 promoted the curing of the 0. 5 mm diameter pieces in depth about 0. 5 mm, which allowed the prototyping of the scaffolds with sufficient mechanical strength for handling...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe cryoloop is a {{technique}} where a thin nylon loop is used to suspend a film of cryoprotectant containing the oocytes and directly immersing them in <b>liquid</b> nitrogen. 508 <b>bovine</b> oocytes were collected, of these 351 were cryopreserved by slow freezing using standard straws or a new vitrification method using our self-constructed cryoloops and the remainder were controls. After thawing, the oocytes were inseminated by ICSI or standard IVF. The cryoloop vitrification method yielded a survival rate of 90. 5 % and the slow freezing technique a rate of 54. 4 % ($p < 0. 0001 $). When ICSI was performed, cryopreservation by the cryoloop vitrification method resulted in very similar cleavage rate to controls (16. 0 % vs. 17. 3 %) but slow freezing produced a slightly lower rate (9. 4 %). Cleavage rates after IVF in fresh oocytes was higher than the cryopreservation groups (49. 5 % vs. 15. 4 % and 25. 8 %), whereas after ICSI the rates were similar in all groups (17. 3 % vs. 9. 4 % and 16 %).

40|$|The {{ability of}} three {{isolates}} each of seven pathogenic Candida species {{to grow in}} a <b>liquid</b> medium containing <b>bovine</b> serum albumin (BSA) as a nitrogen source was determined. All three strains of C. albicans, two strains of C. guilliermondii and one strain of C tropicalis grew well. At any time proteinase activity was detected in the culture filtrates o only the most virulent species [...] C albicans, C tropicalis and C. parapsilosis and this observation was related to complete hydrolysis of BSA. SerologicaUy, cross reactions were demonstrated between anti-proteinase antiserum and C. albicans and C. tropicalis culture filtrates. These results further emphasise {{the role of the}} inducible proteinase of Candida in the pathogenesis of candidosis. An inducible proteinase secreted by Candida albicans {{is likely to be a}} virulence factor of this fungus. Antibodies to the purified enzyme are found commonly in serum samples from patients with systemic candidosis but not in samples from normal individuals [3] and proteinase-deficient strains of C. albicans are less pathogenic for mice than proteinase secretors [5, 14].

This study investigated early ex vivo expansion kinetics of UCB AC 133 + cells (2 - 4 x 10 (4) /ml), mononuclear cells (MNC, 1 - 2 x 10 (6) /ml) and AC 133 negative cells (AC 133 (neg), 2 - 4 x 10 (4) /ml) in stroma-free 8 d <b>liquid</b> culture (fetal <b>bovine</b> serum-supplemented Iscove's-modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) with either 'K 36 EG'[c-Kit ligand, interleukin 3 (IL- 3), IL- 6, erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor] or 'TPOFL' (thrombopoietin, Flt- 3 ligand). Cell enumeration, apoptosis assay and AC 133 /CD 34 /CD 38 antigen immunophenotyping were performed at d 0, 3, 5 and 8.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the agronomic value of animal manure, we quantified {{the effects of}} pedo-climatic, crop and management factors on crop productivity, N use efficiency, and soil organic matter, described with simple indicators that compare manures with mineral fertilizers. We selected 80 European long-term field experiments that used bovine farmyard manure or <b>bovine</b> <b>liquid</b> slurry, alone (FYM and SLU) or combined with mineral fertilizers (FYMm and SLUm), and compared them to mineral fertilizer only reference treatments. We collected 5570 measurements from 107 papers. FYM produced slightly lower crop yields (− 9. 5 %) when used alone and higher (+ 11. 3 %) yields when used in combination with N fertilizer (FYMm), compared to those obtained using mineral fertilizers only. Conditions promoting manure-N mineralization (lighter soil texture, warmer temperature, longer growing season, and shallower incorporation depth) significantly increased the effect of FYM/FYMm on crop yield and yield N. The production efficiency of FYM (yield:N applied ratio) was slightly {{lower than that of}} mineral fertilizers (- 1. 6 %). The apparent N recoveries of FYM and FYMm were 59. 3 % and 78. 7 %, respectively, of mineral fertilizers. Manured soils had significantly higher C (+ 32. 9 % on average for FYM and FYMm) and N (+ 21. 5 %) concentrations. Compared to mineral fertilizers, yield was reduced by 9. 1 % with SLU, but not with SLUm. Influencing factors were similar to those of FYM/FYMm. Efficiency indicators indicated SLU (but not SLUm) was less effective than mineral fertilizers. Slurry significantly increased SOC (on average for SLU and SLUm by + 17. 4 %) and soil N (+ 15. 7 %) concentrations. In conclusion, compared to mineral N fertilizers, bovine farmyard manure and slurry were slightly less effective on the crop, but determined marked increases to SOC and soil N, and thus, to long-term soil fertility maintenance. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Medical {{laboratories}} {{are required}} to participate in interlaboratory comparisons of the analyses they perform. The materials used in these comparisons need to be of sufficient quality so that the comparison provides {{a picture of the}} performances. One of the main characteristics of the testing material is commutability, which is the ability of a material to yield the same numerical relationships between results of measurements as those relationships obtained when the same procedures are applied to patient samples. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the commutability of 3 different matrices for the preparation of proficiency testing material (PTM) for the analysis of carbamazepine and valproic acid. Methods: Patient samples and PTM containing various concentrations of carbamazepine and valproic acid were collected, prepared, and shipped to different laboratories for analysis. Reported results for patient samples from each laboratory were plotted against results for patient samples of each of the other laboratories, and the corresponding regression line was calculated. The distance of results from PTM to the regression line is a measure for commutability. The distance is expressed as a multiple of the SDwl (average within-laboratory SD as calculated from external quality assessment scheme results) and referred to as relative residual. A commutability decision limit of 2 SDwl was set. Results: For carbamazepine and valproic acid, a total of 78 and 105 laboratory couples respectively could be formed. The number of relative residuals for liquid human serum outside the commutability decision limit was 1, 4, and 0 for low, medium, and high concentrations of carbamazepine, respectively and 3, 1, and 0 for low, medium, and high concentrations of valproic acid, respectively. In both <b>liquid</b> and lyophilized <b>bovine</b> sera, the number of relative residuals outside the commutability decision limit was between 2 and 15 and between 6 and 21 for carbamazepine and valproic acid, respectively. Conclusions: Although not all results for PTM with carbamazepine and valproic acid are within the commutability decision limits, a preference for human serum can be seen...|$|R
