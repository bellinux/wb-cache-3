40|$|Chemical group 6 {{consists}} of aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic saturated and unsaturated tertiary alcohols and esters with esters containing tertiary alcohols ethers, of which 13 are currently authorised {{for use as}} flavours in food. The high use level proposed by the applicant for linalool (25 mg/kg complete feed) is safe for salmonids, veal calves, cattle for fattening and pets (excluding cats) without a margin of safety {{with the exception of}} dogs (SF = 1. 4). The safe use level for pigs and dairy cows is 20, for piglets 12 and for poultry 10 mg/kg complete feed. The high use level of 5 mg/kg complete feed for linalyl acetate, linalyl butyrate, <b>linalyl</b> <b>formate,</b> linalyl propionate, linalyl isobutyrate, terpineol, Î±-terpineol and terpineol acetate and 4 -terpinenol is safe for all species with a margin of safety of 1. 2 to 12. For nerolidol, 2 -methyl- 1 -phenylpropan- 2 -ol and 2 -(4 -methylphenyl) propan- 2 -ol, the maximum safe concentration is 1 mg/kg complete feed for pigs and poultry and 1. 5 mg/kg complete feed for all other species. The absence of a margin of safety would not allow the simultaneous administration in feed and water for drinking of the following compounds: linalool, nerolidol, 2 -methyl- 1 -phenylpropan- 2 -ol and 2 -(4 methylphenyl) propan- 2 -ol. No safety concern would arise for the consumer from the use of compounds belonging to CG 6 up to the highest safe level in feedingstuffs for all animal species. All compounds should be considered as irritants to skin, eyes and respiratory tract, and as skin sensitisers. All compounds of CG 6 are predicted to be safe to the soil compartment when used at levels safe to the target species. Using predictions based on chemical structure, 2 -methyl- 1 -phenylpropan- 2 -ol and 2 -(4 -methylphenyl) propan- 2 -ol were estimated to be safe to aquatic compartments. In the absence of experimental data, safety to aquatic compartments could not be established for linalyl butyrate, linalyl isobutyrate, terpineol acetate, 4 -terpinenol, <b>linalyl</b> <b>formate</b> and linalyl propionate. Since all 13 compounds are used in food as flavourings, no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary...|$|E
