The case study of the industrial sector is based on a constant heat demand of a dairy firm, while in the tertiary and residential sectors the options to serve a concentrated heat demand (hospital) and a community housing by a district heating network are explored. The further option of coupling an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) for CHP is explored. The relevance of the research relies on the assessment of the main key factors towards the development of biomass-ESCO operations.

The analysis of initial contact focused on the position of the ankle, knee, and hip in the sagittal plane and step length. The analysis of the loading response included double support percent, peak braking force, peak hip flexion moment, peak knee flexion moment, knee flexion excursion and <b>load</b> <b>rate.</b> We used a two-way, x i repeated measures analysis of variance to check for differences within groups, within conditions, and interaction effects. We found significant differences for hip flexion angle at initial contact, double support percent, and <b>load</b> <b>rate.</b> Follow-up t-tests revealed subjects with knee OA had a larger double support percent and hip flexion angle at initial contact and a decreased <b>load</b> <b>rate</b> compared to unweighted, healthy, older adults. Also, both groups increased their double support percent in response to the challenging weighted walking task, but only the healthy, older adults increased their hip flexion angle at initial contact and decreased their <b>load</b> <b>rate.</b> Correlation and regression analysis of the significant findings found that unweighted, knee OA subjects had a significant relationship between the hip flexion angle at initial contact and double support that did not exist in the healthy, older adults and did not remain when they were weighted. The relationship between <b>load</b> <b>rate</b> and double support in the knee OA group got stronger during the weighted condition, but did not persist in the healthy, older subjects. It appears that during the weighted condition the knee OA group places priority on decreasing loads, secondarily increasing weight-bearing stability, while the healthy, older adults make weight-bearing stability a priority, secondarily decreasing <b>load</b> <b>rate.</b> M.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} first study on the {{mechanical}} behavior of lithium metasilicate glass-ceramic using nanoindentation and in situ scanning probe imaging techniques. Indentation contact hardness, H-c, and Young's modulus, E, were measured at 10 mN peak load and 0. 1 - 2 mN/s <b>loading</b> <b>rates</b> to understand the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> effect on its properties. Indentation imprints were analysed with the in situ scanning probe imaging to understand indentation mechanisms. The average contact hardness increased by 112 % with the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> (ANOVA, p 0. 05). A strain rate sensitivity model was applied to determine the intrinsic contact hardness. Extensive discontinuities and largest maximum, contact and final depths were also observed at the lowest <b>loading</b> <b>rate.</b> These phenomena corresponded to inhomogeneous shear-band flow and densification leading to the material strain softening. The in situ scanning probe images of indentation imprints showed plastic deformation at all <b>loading</b> <b>rates</b> and shear band-induced pileups at the lowest <b>loading</b> <b>rate.</b> With the increase in <b>loading</b> <b>rate,</b> the induced pile-ups decreased. The continuum model predicted the largest densified shear zone at the lowest <b>loading</b> <b>rate.</b> Finally, these results provide scientific insights into the abrasive machining responses of lithium metasilicate glass-ceramic during dental CAD/CAM processes using sharp diamond abrasives...|$|R
40|$|The {{indentation}} {{properties of}} pure aluminum (99. 9 %, 3 N aluminum) and high purity aluminum (99. 999 %, 5 N aluminum) {{with respect to}} the strain rate dependence of strength are experimentally investigated in order to clarify the effect of strain rate on the micro-indentation test. A micro-indentation test using a Berkovich indenter was performed at <b>loading</b> <b>rates</b> of 0. 7, 7, and 70 mN/s. In all of the specimens, the indenter was loaded to a maximum value of 1200 mN, and then was maintained for 30 s. In the 3 N specimen, the dependence of the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> on the <b>load</b> was slight at <b>loading</b> <b>rates</b> of 0. 7 and 7 mN/s, whereas the load at the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> of 70 mN/s was higher than the <b>loads</b> at <b>loading</b> <b>rates</b> of 0. 7 and 7 mN/s. On the other hand, the load for the 5 N specimen increased with the increasing <b>loading</b> <b>rate.</b> Thus, the effect of the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> on the load-displacement curve for the 3 N and 5 N specimens was similar to the strain rate dependence of strength for theses metals. In addition, the micro-indentation test was demonstrated to be strongly affected by high strain <b>rate</b> at a <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> of 70 mN/s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the dynamic shear failure behavior of RC beams under rapid loading through an experimental study and also to set up a strut-and-tie model with <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> effect to predict the dynamic shear resistance of RC beams. Thus, rapid loading test with 24 RC beams with a shear span-to-deep ratio of 1. 9 was performed, in which shear reinforcement ratio and <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> were variable. All of the RC beams exhibited shear compression failure. Although the shear resistance increases with increasing <b>loading</b> <b>rate,</b> the influence of <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> on the shear resistance clearly depends on shear reinforcement ratio. The strut-and-tie model with <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> effect was finally developed, in which the thickness of the compression strut was formulated to be increased with an increase in <b>loading</b> <b>rate.</b> The developed strut-and-tie model was good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R
