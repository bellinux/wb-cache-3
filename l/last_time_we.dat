Wood said of her casting at the time, [...] "I didn't think of her particularly for the continuity announcer, but she came in and could do it, just like that. I'd love to cast her in a song-and-dance number – I feel so sorry for her always having to wear those terrible blouses". When As Seen On TV ended Blake said [...] "I'm very sad that this is the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> will all work together but I understand why Vic wanted to stop.

500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend focused {{primarily}} on the series finale in her review but referred to this episode as containing a solid case-of-the-week. “Overall {{it was a good}} mystery-of-the-week but seeing as it was the second to last episode, the only thing I cared about was that we finally got more Weevil!” Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review, stating that the case-of-the-week was an oversimplification of the overall themes of Veronica Mars. The reviewer enjoyed the potential for Logan and Dick’s character development, although he felt that it was blunted by the knowledge that the series was about to end. “As fun as this episode is, the lack of the fourth season stops me from fully enjoying it. [...] But the knowledge that this might be the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> see them puts a damper on things. Still, better to go out with good episodes than bad.” ...|$|E

500|$|In July 1941, deHavilland was {{reunited with}} Flynn for their eighth movie together, Raoul Walsh's epic They Died with Their Boots On. The film is {{loosely based on}} the {{courtship}} and marriage of George Armstrong Custer and Elizabeth [...] "Libbie" [...] Bacon. Flynn and deHavilland had a falling out the previous yearmainly over the roles she was being givenand she {{did not intend to}} work with him again. Even Flynn acknowledged, [...] "She was sick to death of playing 'the girl' and badly wanted a few good roles to show herself and the world that she was a fine actress." [...] After she learned from Warner that Flynn had come to his office saying he needed her in the film, deHavilland accepted. Screenwriter Lenore Coffee was brought in to add several romantic scenes, and improve the overall dialogue. The result is a film that includes some of their finest work together. Their last appearance on screen is Custer's farewell to his wife. [...] "Errol was quite sensitive," [...] deHavilland would later remember, [...] "I think he knew it would be the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> worked together." [...] Flynn's final line in that scene would hold special meaning for her: [...] "Walking through life with you, ma'am, has been a very gracious thing." [...] They Died with Their Boots On was released on November 21, 1941, and while some reviewers criticized the film's historical inaccuracies, most applauded the action sequences, cinematography, and acting. Thomas M. Pryor of The New York Times found deHavilland [...] "altogether captivating". The film went on to earn $2,550,000 (...) , Warner Bros' second-biggest money-maker of that year.|$|E
500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E
500|$|Tim Sendra of Allmusic {{gave the}} album {{three out of}} five stars review, and said the album had the [...] "cheesy drum machines, samples, and off-kilter lyric {{approach}} that make [...] "Jerk" [...] so good", [...] "the duo stick to the template , considering {{the uniqueness of the}} sound they've created and also the fact that it's a debut record made by teenagers, and an impressive and unfailingly fun debut at that." [...] The review goes on to point out that [...] "the reliance on the [...] "Jerk" [...] sound can be a little monotonous, there are enough variations along the way to keep things interesting." [...] He also says [...] "The duo's flow is not incredible but they spit convincingly. If you were looking for undisputedly pop-rap with a fresh sound and a light lyrical touch, the New Boyz debut is a fine destination." [...] XXL said that the album delivered [...] "unexpected lyrical talent" [...] but that it lacked [...] "sonic variety". The review also {{goes on to say that}} the album [...] "is no hip-hop classic, but rather the breath of fresh air rap needs." [...] Jeff Weiss of The Los Angeles Times gave the album three stars, commenting that the album [...] "is a catchy and charismatic debut that should engender pleasant teen nostalgia in anyone old enough to vote and help explain why for the last six months, the kids have been saying out with the old, in with the New Boyz.". The review also said that the album [...] "successfully strikes a balance between introducing a new sound (the minimalist bass-heavy bounce of jerk music) and style (skinny jeans, Vans and [...] "colors that ain’t even on the rainbow"), with traditional teenage themes (girls, the desire for self-expression, adults who don’t understand, girls). The result is a West Coast antidote to the South’s veritable monopoly on homeroom rap—a relentlessly breezy and fun ride through the lives of a pair of class clowns bent on enjoying the face cards that fate dealt." [...] The Selby Times said that the album [...] "is about as happening as it gets for teenage music with an attitude, even if it makes adults' eyes roll in disgust." [...] Wendy Roby of BBC said that, [...] "But overall their sheer chutzpah wins you over – and with its day-glo tongue wedged so very firmly in its cheek, Skinny Jeanz and a Mic is hard to resist." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the album [...] "one of the year’s most charming rap debuts, and certainly the least expected." [...] In a separate review, he named the album the sixth best album of the year, commenting, [...] "Emerging from Southern California’s jerk scene, this teenage duo made an album that’s appealingly young, simultaneously wide-eyed and knowingly lewd." [...] DJBooth.net's Nathan Slavik was less positive, predicting that the album would be [...] "the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> hear from the New Boyz." ...|$|E
