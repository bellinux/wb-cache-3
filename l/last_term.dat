5|$|During {{the period}} in which the populares party {{controlled}} the city, they flouted convention by re-electing Marius consul several times without observing the customary ten-year interval between offices. They also transgressed the established oligarchy by advancing unelected individuals to magisterial office, and by substituting magisterial edicts for popular legislation. Sulla soon made peace with Mithridates. In 83 BC, he returned to Rome, overcame all resistance, and recaptured the city. Sulla and his supporters then slaughtered most of Marius' supporters. Sulla, having observed the violent results of radical popular reforms, was naturally conservative. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and by extension the senate. Sulla made himself dictator, passed a series of constitutional reforms, resigned the dictatorship, and served one <b>last</b> <b>term</b> as consul. He died in 78 BC.|$|E

Johansson replaced him once more in 1927, but Landgren took over more permanently a year later. Landgren's <b>last</b> <b>term</b> as chairman lasted until 1934, when he was suspended {{along with the rest of}} the club's board of directors and several of its players, soon after the side was found to have breached the ban on professional players then active in Swedish football.

Indira {{was sworn in as}} Prime Minister by Reddy for what would become her <b>last</b> <b>term</b> in office in January 1980. Between 1980 and 1982 President Reddy led seven state visits abroad, visiting the USSR, Bulgaria, Kenya, Zambia, the UK, Ireland, Indonesia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Ireland and Yugoslavia.

5|$|As {{the crisis}} unfolded, {{tensions}} were {{high in the}} U.S.; less so in the Soviet Union, where Khrushchev made several public appearances, {{and went to the}} Bolshoi Theatre to hear American opera singer Jerome Hines, who was then performing in Moscow. By 25 October, with the Soviets unclear about Kennedy's full intentions, Khrushchev decided that the missiles would have to be withdrawn from Cuba. Two days later, he offered Kennedy terms for the withdrawal. Khrushchev agreed to withdraw the missiles in exchange for a U.S. promise not to invade Cuba and a secret promise that the U.S. would withdraw missiles from Turkey, near the Soviet heartland. As the <b>last</b> <b>term</b> was not publicly announced {{at the request of the}} U.S., and was not known until just before Khrushchev's death in 1971, the resolution was seen as a great defeat for the Soviets, and contributed to Khrushchev's fall less than two years later. Castro had urged Khrushchev to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on the U.S. in the event of any invasion of Cuba, and was angered by the outcome, referring to Khrushchev in profane terms.|$|E
