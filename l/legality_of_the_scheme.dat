50|$|In February 2007, Meijer was {{involved}} {{in an effort to}} recall the elected officials of Acme Township in Grand Traverse County, because of the officials' reluctance to allow a new store along M-72 within the rural township. Meijer retained Seyferth, Spaulding and Tennyson, a Grand Rapids public relations firm, to help orchestrate the recall effort. In January 2008, a criminal investigation was launched by the Michigan State Police into the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheme.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In March 2007 Gazprom City {{was renamed}} Okhta Center. Simultaneously, {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{pressure}} from opposition groups, financial scheme was changed: now Gazprom was supposed to provide 51% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> construction, city would have covered the remaining 49% and received capital stocks in exchange. However, {{according to the federal}} law about joint stock companies, shareholders do not become owners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> property. Thus, Gazprom would have still been a full owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Okhta Center real estate. As a result <b>of</b> contention around <b>the</b> construction, it became apparent that Valentina Matviyenko, <b>the</b> governor <b>of</b> Saint Petersburg, included funding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> construction in the city budget in <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> feasibility studies and land agreement. Yabloko initiated a court case questioning <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financing <b>scheme.</b> Saint Petersburg City Court denied the case ...|$|R
40|$|This note {{discusses}} the recent decision by <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Lords in R v Durham Police and another, ex parte R. 1 This case concerns <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reprimand <b>scheme</b> introduced by <b>the</b> Crime and Disorder Act 19982 which replaced the previous informal and formal system <b>of</b> cautions. <b>The</b> principal {{issue in this}} case was whether it was necessary for an offender to consent to a reprimand being issued or whether one can be imposed on a youth offender. Consent was a pre-requisite for formal cautions, and continues to be so for adult offenders yet the statute is silent as to <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> consent in <b>the</b> reprimand system. <b>The</b> House <b>of</b> Lords, in this case, decided that consent was not required before the police could issue a reprimand and it is contended in this article that this has significant implications for <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> juvenile offenders to due process. The case is important but also quite unusual in that it is one of these rare situations when the decision is de jure unanimous but de facto a majority decision, with Lady Hale and Lord Steyn strenuously objecting to the decision but without actually dissenting. The objection takes <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> an examination of International law although Lady Hale concludes that its place within the European Convention on Human Rights remains questionable and thus the temptation to proceed to Strasbourg for a definitive ruling may well be compelling...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> was {{indirectly}} {{challenged in}} the case Caitlin Reilly and Jamieson Wilson v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. The High Court partially found in the claimants' favour; they then appealed to the Court of Appeal, which ruled in February 2013 that the 2011 Regulations 'were unlawful and that the Secretary of State had acted beyond the powers {{given to him by}} Parliament by failing to provide any detail about the various [...] "Back to Work" [...] schemes in the Regulations'.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{airlines}} agreed {{to set up}} a clearing house to manage debt and credit accounts among themselves. Each airline in the group owed multiple and changing debts to one another, so to make settlements easier, participants were not meant to claim against one another, but simply enter their transactions in the clearing house, and then settle the balance {{at the end of each}} month. The clearing house fell under the authority of the International Air Transport Association, or IATA. British Eagle went into liquidation, and owed money to the clearing house overall, but was a creditor to Air France. The liquidator attempted to recover the money from Air France and Air France argued it was bound by the clearing house scheme, and could only collect money after netting out the claims of creditors of British Eagle in IATA. So the liquidator challenged the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheme,</b> as it purported to sidestep the mandatory rules on pari passu distribution.|$|E
40|$|The single level lot-sizing problem arises {{whenever}} a manufacturing com-pany wishes to translate an aggregate plan for production of an end item into a detailed planning of its production. Although {{this problem is}} widely studied in the literature, only laborious dynamic programming approaches are known to guarantee global minimum. Thus, stochastically-based heuristics that have the mechanism to escape from local minimum are needed. Two implementations of stochastic local search techniques for solving single level lot-sizing problems are proposed {{and the results of}} applying them to example problems are discussed. In the first implementation, simulated annealing is used to examine the neighborhoods of the replenishment points of an initial schedule obtained by following the standard Silver-Meal criterion. This provides a way of escaping local minimum in the total relevant costs per unit time for the current replenishment and thus improves the initial lot-sizing schedule. In the second implementation, a lot-sizing population-generating heuristic is used to feed chromosomes to a genetic algorithm which will try to find the optimal lot-sizing scheme without going through the process of examining the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> for every generation. The application of the heuristic to generate an initial population results in a faster convergence in finding the optimal lot-sizing scheme. The result of this research shows that for uncapacitated lot-sizing problems using the sample of data, simu-lated annealing outperforms genetic algorithm in terms of run time and convergence rate. However, genetic algorithm outperforms simulated anneal-ing in terms of a lower total production cost for problems with production penalties...|$|E
