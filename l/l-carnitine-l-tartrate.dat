40|$|The Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VKM) has, at {{the request}} of the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA), {{assessed}} the risk of 1500 mg/day of L-carnitine and 2250 mg/day of <b>L-carnitine-L-tartrate</b> in food supplements. L-carnitine occurs naturally in foods and is endogenously synthesised. <b>L-carnitine-L-tartrate</b> is synthesised commercially, and it dissociates into L-carnitine and tartaric acid in the gastrointestinal tract. Based on the included literature there was no evidence indicating that age affects sensitivity towards L-carnitine, <b>L-carnitine-L-tartrate</b> or tartaric acid. Therefore, in this risk characterisation the same tolerance level as for adults was assumed for children and adolescents (adjusted for body weight). VKM concludes that a dose of 1500 mg of L-carnitine per day, which is equivalent to a dose of 2250 mg of <b>L-carnitine-L-tartrate</b> per day, is unlikely to cause adverse health effects in adolescents (14 to < 18 years), whereas intake at this level in children (10 to < 14 years) may represent a risk of adverse health effects. The tartaric acid exposure from this dose of <b>L-carnitine-L-tartrate</b> is unlikely to cause adverse health effects...|$|E
40|$|Carbohydrate-protein–based multi-ingredient {{supplements}} {{have been}} proposed as an effective strategy for limiting the deleterious effects of exercise-induced muscle damage. This study compares {{the effects of a}} commercially available carbohydrate–protein supplement enriched with l-glutamine and <b>l-carnitine-l-tartrate</b> to carbohydrate alone or placebo on sprint performance, muscle damage markers, and recovery from intermittent exercise. On 3 occasions, 10 recreationally trained males ingested a multi-ingredient, a carbohydrate supplement, or a placebo before, during, and immediately after a 90 -min intermittent repeated sprint test. Fifteen-metre sprint times, creatine kinase, myoglobin, and interleukin- 6 were assessed before (pre), immediately after (post), 1 h after (1 h), and 24 h after (24 h) exercise. Total sprint time measured during the intermittent protocol was not different between conditions. Fifteen-metre sprint time was slower (p 0. 05). Creatine kinase at 24 h was lower (p < 0. 05) in the multi-ingredient (461. 8 ± 271. 8 U·L) compared with both carbohydrate and placebo (606 ± 314. 5 U·L and 636 ± 344. 6 U·L, respectively). Myoglobin increased (p < 0. 05) in all 3 conditions at post and 1 h compared with pre, showing lower values at 1 h (p < 0. 05) for the carbohydrate and a trend (p = 0. 060) for multi-ingredient compared with the placebo condition (211. 4 ± 127. 2 ng·mL− 1 and 239. 4 ± 103. 8 ng·mL− 1 vs. 484. 6 ± 200. 0 ng·mL− 1, respectively). Interleukin- 6 increased at both post and 1 h compared with pre (p < 0. 05) with no differences between conditions. In conclusion, ingesting a multi-ingredient supplement before, during, and immediately after a 90 -min intermittent sprint test resulted in no effects on performance and fatigue while the accumulation of some biomarkers of muscle damage could be attenuated...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} ingesting a multi-ingredient (53 g carbohydrate, 14. 5 g whey protein, 5 g glutamine, 1. 5 g <b>L-carnitine-L-tartrate)</b> supplement, carbohydrate only, or placebo on intermittent performance, perception of fatigue, immunity, and functional and metabolic markers of recovery. Sixteen amateur soccer players ingested their respective treatments before, during and after performing a 90 -min intermittent repeated sprint test. Primary outcomes included time for a 90 -min intermittent repeated sprint test (IRS) followed by eleven 15 m sprints. Measurements included creatine kinase, myoglobin, interleukine- 6, Neutrophil; Lymphocytes and Monocyte before (pre), immediately after (post), 1 h and 24 h after exercise testing period. Overall, time for the IRS and 15 m sprints was not different between treatments. However, the perception of fatigue was attenuated (P< 0. 001) for the multi-ingredient (15. 9 ± 1. 4) vs. placebo (17. 8 ± 1. 4) {{but not for the}} carbohydrate (17. 0 ± 1. 9) condition. Several changes in immune/inflammatory indices were noted as creatine kinase peaked at 24 h while Interleukin- 6 and myoglobin increased both immediately after and at 1 h compared with baseline (P< 0. 05) for all three conditions. However, Myoglobin (P< 0. 05) was lower 1 h post-exercise for the multi-ingredient (241. 8 ± 142. 6 ng·ml- 1) and CHO (265. 4 ± 187. 8 ng·ml- 1) vs. placebo (518. 6 ± 255. 2 ng·ml- 1). Carbohydrate also elicited lower neutrophil concentrations vs. multi-ingredient (3. 9 ± 1. 5 109 /L vs. 4. 9 ± 1. 8 109 /L, P = 0. 016) and a reduced (P< 0. 05) monocytes count (0. 36 ± 0. 09 109 /L) compared to both multi-ingredient (0. 42 ± 0. 09 109 /L) and placebo (0. 42 ± 0. 12 109 /L). In conclusion, multi-ingredient and carbohydrate supplements did not improve intermittent performance, inflammatory or immune function. However, both treatments did attenuate serum myoglobin, while only carbohydrate blunted post-exercise leukocytosis...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that insulin increases muscle total carnitine (TC) content during acute i. v. l-carnitine infusion. Here we determined {{the effects of}} chronic l-carnitine and carbohydrate (CHO; to elevate serum insulin) ingestion on muscle TC content and exercise metabolism and performance in humans. On three visits, each separated by 12 weeks, 14 healthy male volunteers (age 25. 9 ± 2. 1 years, BMI 23. 0 ± 0. 8 kg m− 2) performed an exercise test comprising 30 min cycling at 50 %, 30 min at 80 %, then a 30 min work output performance trial. Muscle biopsies were obtained at rest and after exercise at 50 % and 80 % on each occasion. Following visit one, volunteers ingested either 80 g of CHO (Control) or 2 g of <b>l-carnitine-l-tartrate</b> and 80 g of CHO (Carnitine) twice daily for 24 weeks in a randomised, double blind manner. All significant effects reported occurred after 24 weeks. Muscle TC increased from basal by 21 % in Carnitine (P < 0. 05), and was unchanged in Control. At 50 %, the Carnitine group utilised 55 % less muscle glycogen compared to Control (P < 0. 05) and 31 % less pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activation compared to before supplementation (P < 0. 05). Conversely, at 80 %, muscle PDC activation was 38 % higher (P < 0. 05), acetylcarnitine content showed a trend to be 16 % greater (P < 0. 10), muscle lactate content was 44 % lower (P < 0. 05) and the muscle PCr/ATP ratio was better maintained (P < 0. 05) in Carnitine compared to Control. The Carnitine group increased work output 11 % from baseline in the performance trial, while Control showed no change. This is the first demonstration that human muscle TC can be increased by dietary means and results in muscle glycogen sparing during low intensity exercise (consistent {{with an increase in}} lipid utilisation) and a better matching of glycolytic, PDC and mitochondrial flux during high intensity exercise, thereby reducing muscle anaerobic ATP production. Furthermore, these changes were associated with an improvement in exercise performance...|$|E
