40|$|Abstract: At {{events on}} School Cartography in Brazil, local school atlases {{have been one}} of the {{subjects}} most frequently presented. However, further research is necessary to elucidate how these materials can be used in teachers practices. To this end, a collaborative research was conducted involving fifteen teachers, to investigate the production of knowledge about space based on a <b>local</b> <b>atlas.</b> This article discusses the findings from 4 th grade classes (10 -year-olds) engaged in school activities about the schools surroundings. We found that, by drawing the route from home to school, the students attempted to graphically shape what they observed and experienced along this route, thus establishing a strong identity between their pictures and the route. The teachers, on the other hand, had expected the pictures to reflect shapes resembling those found on maps. It is interesting to note the different meanings the legends took on in this process. School Cartography emerged quite recently on the Brazilian educational scene, where production in this line of investigation was incipient up to the 1990 s. Colloquiums on Cartography for Children, held biennially since 1995, stimulated the increase of publications and brought together a growing number of people interested in the subject. In the opening conference of the 1 st Iberian-American Symposium on Cartography for Children (ALMEIDA, 2002), we noted the almost total absence of papers about the importance of cartographic knowledge in teachers education. This is therefore an important field of research, since it involves Licentiate courses and the actions aimed at continued teacher training relevant actions for the inclusion of Cartography teaching in the school curriculum.

40|$|Purpose: The authors {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} shape-based averaging (SBA) technique for whole-body bone segmentation from MRI {{in the context of}} MRI-guided attenuation correction (MRAC) in hybrid PET/MRI. To enhance the performance of the SBA scheme, the authors propose to combine it with statistical atlas fusion techniques. Moreover, a fast and efficient shape comparison-based atlas selection scheme was developed and incorporated into the SBA method. Methods: Clinical studies consisting of PET/CT and MR images of 21 patients were used to assess the performance of the SBA method. In addition, the authors assessed the performance of simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) and the selective and iterative method for performance level estimation (SIMPLE) combined with SBA. In addition, a local shape comparison scheme (L-Shp) was proposed to improve the performance of SBA. The SIMPLE method was applied globally (G-SIMPLE) while STAPLE method was employed at both global (G-STAPLE) and local (L-STAPLE) levels. The evaluation was performed based on the accuracy of extracted whole-body bones, fragmentation, and computation time achieved by the different methods. The majority voting (MV) atlas fusion scheme was also evaluated as a conventional and commonly used method. MRI-guided attenuation maps were generated using the different segmentation methods. Thereafter, quantitative analysis of PET attenuation correction was performed using CT-based attenuation correction as reference. Results: The SBA and MV methods resulted in considerable underestimation of bone identification (Dice approximate to 0. 62) and high factious fragmentation error of contiguous structures. Applying global atlas selection or regularization (G-STAPLE and G-SIMPLE) to the SBA method enhanced bone segmentation accuracy up to a Dice = 0. 66. The best results were achieved when applying the L-STAPLE method with a Dice of 0. 76 and the L-Shp method with a Dice of 0. 75. However, L-STAPLE required up to five-fold increased computation time compared to the L-Shp method. Moreover, both L-STAPLE and L-Shp methods resulted in less than 3 % SUV mean relative error and 6 % SUV mean absolute error in bony structures owing to superior bone identification accuracy. The quantitative analysis using joint histograms revealed good correlation between PET-MRAC images using the proposed L-Shp algorithm and the corresponding reference PET-CT images. Conclusions: The performance of SBA was enhanced through application of <b>local</b> <b>atlas</b> weighting or regularization schemes (L-STAPLE and L-Shp). Bone recognition, fragmentation of the contiguous structures, and quantitative PET uptake recovery improved dramatically using these methods while the proposed L-Shp method significantly reduced the computation time.

Using a <b>local</b> school <b>atlas</b> as the source of information, a Web-based prototype of the School Atlas of Rio Claro (SP) was developed in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). SVG is a vector-based standard for publishing interactive graphics on the Web validated by the Web Consortium. This prototype was tested with a group of Brazilian primary school teachers. The test was conducted with fourteen teachers, all of them were familiar with the paper version of the School Atlas. During weekly meetings, the participants took notes to discuss and reflect about the practices held in school with loca l maps. The main test carried out with teachers was to prepare a paper activity based on the atlas content. The idea behind this activity was to foster teachers to leave a passive role as mere users and interact with the product in a more active fashion. In order to enable them {{to take full advantage of}} simple digital tools they were briefly trained to capture screen, use image editing software (they were instructed on the use of Paint, an image editing application available in Windows), and to copy text from the atlas. The results demonstrated that the teachers were keen to interact with the product and, although reproducing some common practices of paper atlas use, they revealed a deep interest on the use of the Internet as a medium for education and the prototype itself. A second test was carried out with a group of atlas developers. They were given a time frame of two weeks to develop an SVG-based atlas using the methodology proposed in this research. They completed the task within the time frame propose d however they indicated that more specific training should be desirable; this finding indicates the need to introduce digital map publishing as a subject to be taught in geosciences undergraduate courses in Brazil.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} whole-body bone extraction from whole-body MR images using a number of atlas-based segmentation methods. The motivation behind this work {{is to find the}} most promising approach for the purpose of MRI-guided derivation of PET attenuation maps in whole-body PET/MRI. To this end, a variety of atlas-based segmentation strategies commonly used in medical image segmentation and pseudo-CT generation were implemented and evaluated in terms of whole-body bone segmentation accuracy. Bone segmentation was performed on 23 whole-body CT/MR image pairs via leave-one-out cross validation procedure. The evaluated segmentation techniques include: (i) intensity averaging (IA), (ii) majority voting (MV), (iii) global and (iv) <b>local</b> (voxel-wise) weighting <b>atlas</b> fusion frameworks implemented utilizing normalized mutual information (NMI), normalized cross-correlation (NCC) and mean square distance (MSD) as image similarity measures for calculating the weighting factors, along with other atlas-dependent algorithms, such as (v) shape-based averaging (SBA) and (vi) Hofmann's pseudo-CT generation method. The performance evaluation of the different segmentation techniques was carried out in terms of estimating bone extraction accuracy from whole-body MRI using standard metrics, such as Dice similarity (DSC) and relative volume difference (RVD) considering bony structures obtained from intensity thresholding of the reference CT images as the ground truth. Considering the Dice criterion, global weighting atlas fusion methods provided moderate improvement of whole-body bone segmentation (DSC=[*] 0. 65 [*]±[*] 0. 05) compared to non-weighted IA (DSC=[*] 0. 60 [*]±[*] 0. 02). The <b>local</b> weighed <b>atlas</b> fusion approach using the MSD similarity measure outperformed the other strategies by achieving a DSC of 0. 81 [*]±[*] 0. 03 while using the NCC and NMI measures resulted in a DSC of 0. 78 [*]±[*] 0. 05 and 0. 75 [*]±[*] 0. 04, respectively. Despite very long computation time, the extracted bone obtained from both SBA (DSC=[*] 0. 56 [*]±[*] 0. 05) and Hofmann's methods (DSC=[*] 0. 60 [*]±[*] 0. 02) exhibited no improvement compared to non-weighted IA. Finding the optimum parameters for implementation of the atlas fusion approach, such as weighting factors and image similarity patch size, have great impact on the performance of atlas-based segmentation approaches. The voxel-wise atlas fusion approach exhibited excellent performance in terms of cancelling out the non-systematic registration errors leading to accurate and reliable segmentation results.

40|$|International audiencePurpose:To {{present a}} method to enrich atlases for atlas based segmentation. Such enriched atlases can then {{be used as a}} single atlas or within a multiatlas framework. Methods:In this paper, machine {{learning}} techniques have been used to enhance the atlas based segmentation approach. The enhanced atlas defined in this work is a pair composed of a gray level image alongside an image of multiclass classifiers with one classifier per voxel. Each classifier embeds local information from the whole training dataset that allows for the correction of some systematic errors in the segmentation and accounts for the possible local registration errors. The authors also propose to use these images of classifiers within a multiatlas framework: results produced by a set of such <b>local</b> classifier <b>atlases</b> can be combined using a label fusion method. Results:Experiments have been made on the in vivoimages of the IBSR dataset and a comparison has been made with several state-of-the-art methods such as FreeSurfer and the multiatlas nonlocal patch based method of Coupé or Rousseau. These experiments show that their method is competitive with state-of-the-art methods while having a low computational cost. Further enhancement has also been obtained with a multiatlas version of their method. It is also shown that, in this case, nonlocal fusion is unnecessary. The multiatlas fusion can therefore be done efficiently. Conclusions:The single atlas version has similar quality as state-of-the-arts multiatlas methods but with the computational cost of a naive single atlas segmentation. The multiatlas version offers a improvement in quality and can be done efficiently without a nonlocal strategy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Quantification {{of brain}} {{development}} {{as well as}} disease-induced pathologies in neonates often requires precise delineation of white matter, grey matter and cerebrospinal fluid. Unlike adults, tissue segmentation in neonates is significantly more challenging due to the inherently lower tissue contrast. Most existing methods take a voxel-based approach and are limited to working with images from a single time-point, even though longitudinal scans are available. We take a different approach {{by taking advantage of}} the fact that the pattern of the major sulci and gyri are already present in the neonates and generally preserved but fine-tuned during brain development. That is, the segmentation of latetime-point image can be used to guide the segmentation of neonatal image. Accordingly, we propose a novel longitudinally guided level-sets method for consistent neonatal image segmentation by combining <b>local</b> intensity information, <b>atlas</b> spatial prior, cortical thickness constraint, and longitudinal information into a variational framework. The minimization of the proposed energy functional is strictly derived from a variational principle. Validation performed on both simulated and in vivo neonata...|$|R

Preliminary tests demonstrate that the atlas building shows excellent robustness and a very good convergence, i. e. atlases start to stabilize after 5 images only and do not show significant changes when including more than 10 volumetric images taken from the same population. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Richmond {{is one of}} only {{a handful}} of {{municipalities}} in Rhode Island in which there is no postal code in at least a section of town used with the town's name. Instead, Richmond consists of seven different zip codes that are used with villages: Carolina, a village of Richmond (02812); Hope Valley, a village of Hopkinton (02832); Kenyon, a village of Richmond (02836); Shannock, a village of Richmond (02875); West Kingston, a village of South Kingstown (02892); Wood River Junction, a village of Richmond (02894) and Wyoming, a village of Richmond (02898). This leads to Richmond being a rather unknown town, and appearances of the town name on even <b>local</b> maps and <b>atlases</b> are rare. Due to this scenario most residents of Richmond identify themselves with their village instead of the town itself. However, USPS recognizes [...] "Richmond" [...] as an acceptable alternative for mailing for 6 of Richmond's 7 zip codes, the exception being 02894 (Wood River Junction). Other municipalities in Rhode Island that also have this situation include Burrillville, Glocester, New Shoreham, Scituate and South Kingstown.|$|R
30|$|In Morocco, {{trees and}} forests {{have been and}} still are the pillar of several {{traditional}} farming systems. The most spectacular example concerns the multiple uses of the emblematic argan tree (Argania spinosa), widely known because of the famous cosmetic oil it produces, and {{also because of the}} very popular tourist attraction of goats climbing onto the top of the trees. This system has seen a very long historic trajectory of co-evolution between trees and livestock (Bourbouze and El Aïch 2005; McGregor et al. 2009). In the mountains of the High <b>Atlas,</b> <b>local</b> populations have developed highly sophisticated practices in order to manage forest resources for combined fodder and timber production (Genin and Simenel 2011). An undocumented example is given here concerning the multipurpose management of a native ash tree (Fraxinus dimorpha), which is pollarded and pruned for the production of poles and beams, but also mainly for the feeding of small ruminant flocks. As far as we know, F. dimorpha has not been documented in terms of its forage interest and management. In particular, no information is available on its nutritive value, or on traditional management practices.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a bicategory (Red Orb) of reduced orbifolds {{in the framework}} of classical differential geometry (i. e. without any explicit reference to notions of Lie groupoids or differentiable stacks, but only using orbifold <b>atlases,</b> <b>local</b> lifts and changes of charts). In order to construct such a bicategory, we first define a 2 -category (Red Atl) whose objects are reduced orbifold atlases (on any paracompact, second countable, Hausdorff topological space). The definition of morphisms is obtained as a slight modification of a definition by A. Pohl, while the definitions of 2 -morphisms and compositions of them is new in this setup. Using the bicalculus of fractions described by D. Pronk, we are able to construct the bicategory (Red Orb) from the 2 -category (Red Atl). We prove that (Red Orb) is equivalent to the bicategory of reduced orbifolds described in terms of proper, effective, étale Lie groupoids by D. Pronk and I. Moerdijk and to the 2 -category of reduced orbifolds described by several authors in the past in terms of a suitable class of differentiable Deligne-Mumford stacks. Comment: An essential part of the proof has been generalized and is now contained in a series of separated papers about bicategories of fractions. The description of the homotopy category has also been moved to a separated pape...|$|R
