5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E
25|$|A dog {{walks on}} its toes <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> does; a dog's pastern and paws are {{analogous}} {{to the back of}} a human's hand and fingers, respectively. The pasterns slope very slightly, but are not weak. Feet are round and compact with well-arched toes; the feet turn neither in nor out.|$|E

25|$|Jie {{was also}} a known alcoholic, {{but he did not}} drink regular wine. He drank a type of pure alcohol wine (清醇). The people working for him who could not supply this drink were killed. Many people died because of this. And while he was {{drinking}} wine it was required that he ride on someone’s back <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{suggestion}} is that the unicorn {{is based on the}} extinct rhinocerus species Elasmotherium, a huge Eurasian mammal native to the steppes, south of the range of the woolly rhinoceros of Ice Age Europe. Elasmotherium looked little <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse,</b> but it had a large single horn in its forehead. It became extinct {{about the same time as}} the rest of the glacial age megafauna.|$|E
25|$|In one {{incident}} Jie was riding {{the back of}} a top chancellor <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse.</b> After a while the chancellor was tired to the point that he could no longer crawl or move. He asked King Jie to spare him. Jie immediately dragged him out to be executed. Another chancellor, Guan Longfeng (關龍逢), told the king that he was losing the trust of his people along with the Xia dynasty’s rivers and mountains (江山). After yelling at Guan, he too was dragged out to be killed.|$|E

25|$|Various {{theories}} of Elasmothere morphology, nutrition and habits {{have been the}} cause of wide variation in reconstruction. Some show the beast trotting <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> with a horn; others hunched over with head to the ground, like a bison, and still others immersed in swamps like a hippopotamus. The use of the horn {{and whether or not}} there was one, and how large, have been popular topics. The statistical correlations of modern palaeontology have taken much of the speculation out of the subject, although some details remain undetermined.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} the visual interest of his show, Emerson would abuse his Hammond L-100 organ by, among other things, hitting it, beating {{it with a}} whip, pushing it over, riding it across the stage <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse,</b> playing with it lying on top of him, and wedging knives into the keyboard. Some of these actions also produced musical sound effects: hitting the organ caused it to make explosion-like sounds, turning it over made it feed back, and the knives held down keys, thus sustaining notes. Emerson's show with the Nice has been cited as having a strong influence on heavy metal musicians.|$|E
25|$|Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack) — Trigger, {{apparently}} {{so called}} because he looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse,</b> {{was the principal}} supporting character earlier in the show's run, although his importance lessened as the series progressed. Lloyd Pack was cast by pure chance: Ray Butt, who hired him to portray Trigger after seeing him in a stage play, had only attended that play to observe potential Del Boy actor Billy Murray. A daft road sweeper most frequently seen in the Nag's Head, Trigger was initially portrayed as a small-time thief, supplying Del with dubious goods. In later episodes he came to adopt the 'village idiot' role, and believes that Rodney's real name is Dave.|$|E

50|$|The sea trow (Trowis) of Stronsay, {{according}} to Jo Bens Description of the Orkney Islands (1529), was a maritime monster resembling a colt whose entire body was cloaked in seaweed, with a coiled or matted coat of hair, sexual organs <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>horses,</b> and known to copulate {{with the women}} of the island.|$|R
25|$|The Baby Race {{started in}} series 4 and {{continued}} through to series 5. In the game, six babies {{and their parents}} were brought into the studio. Each parent sat {{at one end of}} a mat and the first baby to get from one parent to the other was the winner. Usually the parent on the far side held an object or toy that the baby liked, or found interesting. The race was treated much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> race (to get points the Bungalow Heads had to bet on which baby they thought would win) up to and including the humorous commentary where other 'race tracks' are referred to as if baby racing was a popular sport.|$|E
25|$|With the Renaissance there {{began to}} be a reinterpretation {{of what it was}} that changed the men, if it was not simply magic. For Socrates, in Classical times, it had been gluttony {{overcoming}} their self-control. But for the influential emblematist Andrea Alciato, it was unchastity. In the second edition of his Emblemata (1546), therefore, Circe became the type of the prostitute. His Emblem 76 is titled Cavendum a meretricibus; its accompanying Latin verses mention Picus, Scylla and the companions of Ulysses, and concludes that ‘Circe with her famous name indicates a whore and any who loves such a one loses his reason’. His English imitator Geoffrey Whitney used a variation of Alciato's illustration in his own Choice of Emblemes (1586) but gave it the new title of Homines voluptatibus transformantur, men are transformed by their passions. This explains her appearance in the Nighttown section named after her in James Joyce's novel Ulysses. Written {{in the form of a}} stage script, it makes of Circe the brothel madam, Bella Cohen. Bloom, the book’s protagonist, fantasizes that she turns into a cruel man-tamer named Mr Bello who makes him get down on all fours and rides him <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|E
500|$|The duplicates {{idea was}} shelved once {{more as the}} {{producers}} felt it would undermine the impact when the real Voyager returned home. A second idea was proposed based on the Starfleet communication the ship received in [...] "". It would have seen Janeway work out a means to decode the transmission herself, which revealed it to be plans for a [...] "slipstream" [...] drive. Seven was to be wary as the technology had resulted {{in the destruction of}} Borg vessels.

500|$|The quagga is {{believed}} to have been [...] long and [...] tall at the shoulder. Its coat pattern was unique among equids: zebra-like in the front but more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> in the rear. It had brown and white stripes on the head and neck, brown upper parts and a white belly, tail and legs. The stripes were boldest on the head and neck and became gradually fainter further down the body, blending with the reddish brown of the back and flanks, until disappearing along the back. It appears to have had a high degree of polymorphism, with some individuals having almost no stripes and others having patterns similar to the extinct southern population of Burchell's zebra, where the stripes covered most of the body except for the hind parts, legs and belly. It also had a broad dark dorsal stripe on its back. It had a standing mane with brown and white stripes.|$|E

He chooses, among several other prizes, one week of free maid service. When his maid Joan arrives, Peter has her pull items out of his belly button (including, among other things, a ColecoVision set and a carton of Parliament Cigarettes to the shock of Peter, who says he hasn't smoked in ten years), and rides on her back, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse,</b> to the store. Peter decides to over-work Joan on her last night by giving Meg a watermelon filled with chocolate pudding and firecrackers, which explodes in her face. After being introduced to her by Peter, Quagmire {{falls in love with}} her. After dating Joan, Quagmire proposes marriage to her, which she accepts and the couple prepare their marriage ceremony. Lois, Peter and their neighbors visit Quagmire's house, finding that he has changed his personality significantly. Peter still believes this to be a prank and shows Quagmire porn magazines in an attempt to change him back to his former ways. Meanwhile, Lois begins to question whether she should keep breastfeeding Stewie, as he's hurting her when feeding.|$|E
500|$|An {{ensemble}} of 20 actors {{make up the}} bulk of the series' cast. Hawley found ensembles enticing because they presented [...] "a lot of really good moving pieces". At Paleyfest 2015, the Fargo creator commented: [...] "It's sort of <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> race in a way, especially when you know that everyone is on this collision course. It's like, 'Who's going to make it?' And you can put people together in unexpected pairings." [...] Offerman played Karl Weathers, an alcoholic and the only lawyer in Luverne, and Cristin Milioti was assigned the part of Betsy Solverson, Lou's terminally ill wife. Hawley felt that Milioti was the right choice because her personality was similar to her character's. Garrett portrays Joe Bulo, and Bokeem Woodbine appears as Mike Milligan, a role he was offered two days after auditioning. For the role of Hanzee Dent, Hawley hired Zahn McClarnon two weeks after his audition. Six others play members of the Gerhardts: Kieran Culkin as Rye, Rachel Keller as Simone, Michael Hogan as Otto, Allan Dobescu as Charlie, Angus Sampson as Bear, and Jeffrey Donovan as Dodd. When asked about his decision to cast Donovan, Hawley told the actor, [...] "I don't know. You just come off with a sense of power. I think Dodd comes off with a sense of power, and I thought that you have the chops to find the humor in it." [...] Donovan gained 30 pounds in preparation for his role. Other major supporting roles in Fargo second season include: Bruce Campbell as Ronald Reagan, Keir O'Donnell as Ben Schmidt, and Elizabeth Marvel as Constance Heck.|$|E

2500|$|On June 16, 1928, Dewey married Frances Eileen Hutt. A {{native of}} Sherman, Texas, {{she was a}} stage actress; after their {{marriage}} she dropped her acting career. They had two sons, Thomas E. Dewey Jr. and John Martin Dewey. Although Dewey served as a prosecutor and District Attorney in New York City for many years, his home from 1939 until his death was a large farm, called [...] "Dapplemere," [...] located {{near the town of}} Pawling some [...] north of New York City. According to biographer Richard Norton Smith, Dewey [...] "loved Dapplemere as [...] no other place", and Dewey was once quoted as saying that [...] "I work <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> five days and five nights a week for the privilege of getting to the country on the weekend." [...] In 1945, Dewey told a reporter that [...] "my farm is my roots... the heart of this nation is the rural small town." [...] Dapplemere was part of a tight-knit rural community called Quaker Hill, which was known as a haven for the prominent and well-to-do. Among Dewey's neighbors on Quaker Hill were the famous reporter and radio broadcaster Lowell Thomas, the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale, and the legendary CBS News journalist Edward R. Murrow. During his twelve years as governor, Dewey also kept a New York City residence and office in Suite 1527 of the Roosevelt Hotel. Dewey was an active, lifelong member of the Episcopal Church.|$|E
