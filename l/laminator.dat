25|$|The {{ingredients}} to make dried pasta usually include water and semolina flour; egg for colour and richness (in {{some types of}} pasta), and possibly vegetable juice (such as spinach, beet, tomato, carrot), herbs or spices for colour and flavour. After mixing semolina flour with warm water the dough is kneaded mechanically until it becomes firm and dry. If pasta is to be flavoured, eggs, vegetable juices, and herbs are added at this stage. The dough is then passed into the <b>laminator</b> to be flattened into sheets, then compressed by a vacuum mixer-machine to clear out air bubbles and excess water from the dough until the moisture content is reduced to 12%. Next, the dough is processed in a steamer to kill any bacteria it may contain.|$|E

50|$|Many pouch {{laminators}} {{require the}} use of a carrier. A carrier holds the pouch as it is run through the <b>laminator.</b> This helps prevent the hot glue, some of which leaks from the sides of the pouches during the process, from gumming up the rollers. The carrier prevents the rollers from getting sticky, which helps to prevent the lamination pouch from wrapping around the rollers inside the <b>laminator.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pouch {{laminators}} {{are designed}} for moderate use in the office or home. For continuous, large-volume lamination projects, a roll <b>laminator</b> performs more efficiently.|$|E

50|$|Whether {{small office}} or {{industrial}} machines their primary {{function is to}} embellish or protect printed works. Such <b>laminators</b> are used to apply varying thicknesses of lamination film onto substrates such as paper or fabrics. The main advantage {{to the use of}} heated roll <b>laminators</b> is that of speed. Heated <b>laminators</b> use heated rollers or heated shoes to melt the glue which is applied to lamination film. The process of heating the glue prior to applying the film to a substrate allows for a faster application of the film. The laminates and adhesives used are generally cheaper to manufacture than cold roll laminates, often as much as half the cost depending on the comparison made. As the materials are non-adhesive until exposed to heat, they are much easier to handle. The glue is solid at room temperature, so lamination of this type is less likely to shift or warp after its application than pressure activated laminates, which rely on a highly viscous, adhesive fluid.|$|R
50|$|Printers or print {{finishers}} {{often use}} industrial heated roll <b>laminators</b> to laminate {{such things as}} paperback book covers, magazine covers, posters, cards and postcards, in-shop displays {{as well as other}} applications.|$|R

50|$|A pouch <b>laminator</b> uses a {{lamination}} pouch that {{is usually}} sealed on one side. The inside of the lamination pouch is coated with a heat-activated film that adheres to the product being laminated as it runs through the <b>laminator.</b> The substrate side of the board contains a heat-activated adhesive that bonds the print to the substrate. This can be any {{of a number of}} board products or another sheet of laminate. The pouch containing the print, laminate, and substrate is passed through a set of heated rollers under pressure, ensuring that all adhesive layers bond to one another.|$|E
50|$|Cold roll <b>laminators</b> use {{a plastic}} film which is coated with an {{adhesive}} and glossy backing {{which does not}} adhere to the glue. When the glossy backing is removed, the adhesive is exposed, which then sticks directly onto the item which needs to be laminated. This method, apart from having the obvious benefit of not requiring expensive equipment, is also suitable for those items which would be damaged by heat. Cold <b>laminators</b> range from simple two roller, hand crank machines up to large and complex motor driven machines with high precision rollers, adjustable roller pressure and other advanced features.|$|R
50|$|Soma Engineering (officially Soma spol. s r.o.) is flexographic {{printing}} press and converting equipment manufacturer based in Lanškroun, Czech Republic. Company's key products are flexographic presses, slitter rewinders, <b>laminators,</b> plate mounters, sheeters and die cutters.|$|R
50|$|Roll <b>laminators</b> {{typically}} use two {{rolls to}} complete the lamination process, with one roll being on top and the other roll on the bottom. These rolls slide onto metal bars, known as mandrels, which are then placed in the machine and feed through it. In the United States, the most common core size found on lamination film is one inch (25- to 27-inch-wide film). Larger format <b>laminators</b> use a larger core, often 2 to 3 inches in diameter. Film is usually available in 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 10 mil thicknesses. The higher the number, the thicker the film. A mil is one thousandth of an inch (.001").|$|R

50|$|More complex ID {{cards are}} now being created by {{printing}} on a material called Teslin or Artisyn, which are paper-like materials that are actually micro-porous plastic sheets.

50|$|A heated roll <b>laminator</b> uses heated rollers to {{melt glue}} {{extruded}} onto lamination film.

The primary purpose of laminating with such a machine is to embellish or protect printed documents or images. Heated roll laminators can vary in size from office based pouch laminators to industrial sized machines. Such industrial machines are primarily used for high quantity/quality output by printers or print finishers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Purpose of the study: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{effectiveness}} of several types of personal respiratory protection equipment at styrene exposed <b>laminators</b> under real work place conditions. Subjects and method: 99 male styrene exposed workers were examined. During their lamination activities the average styrene concentrations in air ranged between 30 to 60 ppm (maximum: 205 ppm). The <b>laminators</b> were followed during an usual workweek from Monday to Thursday. The external styrene exposure was measured by means of passive active carbon badges. The excretion of mandelic acid (MA) and phenyl glyoxylic acid (PGA) in endof-shift urine samples was used to quantify the internal styrene load. During the work shift some <b>laminators</b> did not use respiratory protection masks. The majority used either a half face mask with active carbon filter or an air purifying respirator. Results: The respiratory masks were worn during an average between 31 % and 72 % of the work time. The styrene concentrations of the ambient air were-depending on the activity- in the range of 30 to 60 ppm. The end-ofshift concentrations of MA and PGA in urine samples varied considerably, their means range from 153 to 606 mg/g creatinine. The comparison shows that workers with air purifying respirators experience the lowest internal styrene body burden in spite of high external exposures...|$|R

50|$|Bill Tritt had a keen {{interest}} in boats and cars. Before the World War II, he studied marine architecture and boat building. He worked for Douglas Aircraft's Production Planning and Illustration Departments during World War II, and by 1945 had built a number of catamaran sailboats. In 1947, John Green, a yachtsman friend, paid Tritt to design and build a racing sailboat in the twenty foot range. Fiberglass seemed the logical construction material, and Otto Bayer of Wizard Boats was enlisted as <b>laminator.</b> The boat was named the Green Dolphin, and four were built. This was Tritt's introduction to fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP). By 1947 he was building small fiberglass boats, and built the first ever fiberglass masts and spars for sailboats. This company became the Glasspar Company and moved to larger quarters in Santa Ana, California, in the early 1950s. By the mid-1950s, Glasspar was producing 15 to 20 percent of all fiberglass boats sold in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|The larger Phantom is a Bermudan rigged sloop, a cruiser racer {{designed}} by Nick Shein and built by Phantom Yachts in Sydney, Australia. Production commenced in 1979, ending {{in the mid}} 90's. Around about 100 phantoms were made, mostly 32 feet in length, however there were 33's 34's and around 6 40's made. The first four 32 foot hulls were manufactured by a spray gun <b>laminator.</b> Subsequent hulls were hand laid under the direct supervision of Nick Shein. Around 1989 the mould was altered to 33 feet in length, the 33 had slightly more beam, a sugar scoop stern and a wider aft quarter berth. The hulls were all manufactured to exceed standards laid down by Lloyds and USL code for GRP yachts. Phantom 32's had single or double inline spreaders, depending on customers preference. Draft was 1.6 Metres with a displacement of 4.25 t. The phantoms are capable of cicumnavigating (Mr Walker, a Phantom 32 did so in the late 80's) and can be sailed short handed.|$|E
