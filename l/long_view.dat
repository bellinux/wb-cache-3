Everybody received autographed copies of the album and Wonder gave interviews. Critical reception was positive. The album {{was viewed as a}} guided tour through a wide range of musical styles and the life and feelings of the artist. It included recollections of childhood, of first love and lost love. It contained songs about faith and love among all peoples and songs about social justice for the poor and downtrodden.|$|E
500|$|By March 1991, No Depression {{had sold}} an {{estimated}} 15,000 copies, and {{was featured in}} a Rolling Stone article about rising stars. However, Rockville Records refused to pay the band any royalties for the album, a theme that would continue {{for the remainder of}} the band's contract. Over seventeen days the band recorded a second album at <b>Long</b> <b>View</b> Farm in rural North Brookfield, Massachusetts. Still Feel Gone, with a more layered sound, was also produced by Kolderie and Slade, with contributions by Slade, Henneman, Rich Gilbert, Chris Bess of Enormous Richard, and Gary Louris of The Jayhawks. The band was disappointed with the production of the album and decided to discontinue working with Kolderie and Slade. Soon afterward, Uncle Tupelo recorded [...] "Shaking Hands (Soldier's Joy)" [...] on Michelle Shocked's album Arkansas Traveler and joined her on the accompanying tour with Taj Mahal and The Band. However, the tour only lasted for a few shows because of managerial problems between Shocked and The Band.|$|E

Roger Silvestre Ramírez and Wendy Pedersen provided additional background vocals on the song, while Andrés Saavedra and Isaías García {{served as the}} recording engineers. It is considered by Arjona as an autobiographical song, commenting that it [...] "contains a good dose {{of the life of}} my old mand", as a reference to his father, who died in 2011. In an interview, music video director Joaquín Cambre commented that [...] "'Vida' is a sweet song, exciting and bitter nonetheless."

500|$|Just {{over two}} weeks after the convention, it was {{revealed}} that Eagleton had been hospitalized and received electroshock therapy for [...] "nervous exhaustion" [...] and [...] "depression" [...] several times during the early to mid-1960s (years later, Eagleton's diagnosis was refined to bipolar II disorder). McGovern initially supported Eagleton, in part because he saw parallels with his daughter Terry's battles with mental illness, and on the following day, July 26, stated publicly, [...] "I am 1,000percent for Tom Eagleton and have no intention of dropping him from the ticket." [...] Though many people still supported Eagleton's candidacy, an increasing number of influential politicians and newspapers questioned his ability to handle the office of vice president and, potentially, president or questioned the McGovern campaign's ability to survive the distraction. The resulting negative attention – combined with McGovern's consultation with preeminent psychiatrists, including Karl Menninger, as well as doctors who had treated Eagleton – prompted McGovern to accept, and announce on August 1, Eagleton's offer to withdraw from the ticket. It remains the only time a major party vice-presidential nominee has been forced off the ticket. Five prominent Democrats then publicly turned down McGovern's offer of the vice presidential slot: in sequence, Kennedy again, Abraham Ribicoff, Humphrey, Reubin Askew, and Muskie (Larry O'Brien was also approached but no offer made). Finally, he named United States Ambassador to France Sargent Shriver, a brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy. McGovern's 1,000 percent statement and subsequent reneging made him look both indecisive and an opportunist, and has since been considered one of the worst gaffes in presidential campaign history. McGovern himself would <b>long</b> <b>view</b> the Eagleton affair as having been [...] "catastrophic" [...] for his campaign.|$|E
