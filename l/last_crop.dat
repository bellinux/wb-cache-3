Love Me True is a half-sister to Shuailaan (Winter Hill Stakes), Madison's Charm (Comely Stakes) and Bite The Bullet (Sanford Stakes), and, as a granddaughter of Lassie Dear, is closely related to Summer Squall, A.

2500|$|Camarine {{was a dark}} {{chestnut}} mare with a white blaze {{and four}} white socks bred near Brandon in Suffolk by Robert Wilson, 9th Baron Berners. She was sired by Wilson's horse Juniper, a [...] "useful" [...] stallion, {{best known as the}} damsire of Velocipede although he may have been the sire of the 1000 Guineas winner Catgut. Camarine came from Juniper's <b>last</b> <b>crop</b> of foals and was said to bear a striking resemblance to her sire. In early 1831, Camarine entered the ownership of Sir Mark Wood, 2nd Baronet, whose other good horses included Lucetta (Ascot Gold Cup) and Galantine (1000 Guineas).|$|E

2500|$|The Zafimaniry {{primarily}} grow maize {{and beans}} {{and have been}} traditionally reliant on tavy (slash-and-burn agriculture). The average Zafimaniry man spends 22 days a year on clearing agricultural land through tavy, while {{the remainder of his}} time can be dedicated to other income earning activities like wood carving or migrating to find seasonal work elsewhere. Maize, which was probably adopted by the Zafimaniry around 200 years ago, is now their staple crop. Fields are burned each year {{at the start of the}} planting season, and are cultivated for four to ten years before their fertility is depleted and they are left fallow for around five years before being planted again. As a field becomes less fertile, maize and bean cultivation is abandoned in favor of potatoes and sweet potatoes. Cassava is the <b>last</b> <b>crop</b> to be grown in a field before it is allowed to go fallow During the fallow period, the Zafimaniry use the fields for other purposes, such as for grazing cattle, growing medicinal plants, and growing non-food plants, bushes and trees for fibers and construction material. After seventy years of this fertile-fallow cycle, the Zafimaniry stop cultivating the land plot entirely and allow it to become permanently fallow pasture land. [...] They supplement their corn, taro and beans with wild products gathered in the surrounding forests, particularly including honey and crayfish.|$|E
60|$|For {{the next}} week or two there was {{quietness}} at the Grange. The dry weather held, and boisterous winds swept the sunburned plain. The sod cracked, the wheat was shriveling, and although in public men and women made a brave pretense of cheerfulness, in private they brooded over the ruin that threatened them. To make things worse, three or four days a week, heavy clouds that raced across the sky all morning gathered in solid banks at noon, and then, as if in mockery, broke up and drove away. Few of the settlers had much reserve capital, and the low prices obtained for the <b>last</b> <b>crop</b> had strained their finances; but Harding was, perhaps, threatened most.|$|E
60|$|It {{is obvious}} that the {{insecurity}} of the Lancastrian usurper, largely because he was a usurper, is the clue to many things, some of which we should now call good, some bad, all of which we should probably call good or bad with the excessive facility with which we dismiss distant things. It led the Lancastrian House to lean on Parliament, which was the mixed matter we have already seen. It may have been in some ways good for the monarchy, to be checked and challenged by an institution which at least kept something of the old freshness and freedom of speech. It was almost certainly bad for the parliament, making it yet more the ally of the mere ambitious noble, of which we shall see much later. It also led the Lancastrian House to lean on patriotism, which was perhaps more popular; to make English the tongue of the court for the first time, and to reopen the French wars with the fine flag-waving of Agincourt. It led it again to lean on the Church, or rather, perhaps, on the higher clergy, and that in the least worthy aspect of clericalism. A certain morbidity which more and more darkened the end of mediævalism showed itself in new and more careful cruelties against the <b>last</b> <b>crop</b> of heresies. A slight knowledge of the philosophy of these heresies will lend little support to the notion that they were in themselves prophetic of the Reformation. It {{is hard to see how}} anybody can call Wycliffe a Protestant unless he calls Palagius or Arius a Protestant; and if John Ball was a Reformer, Latimer was not a Reformer. But though the new heresies did not even hint at the beginning of English Protestantism, they did, perhaps, hint at the end of English Catholicism. Cobham did not light a candle to be handed on to Nonconformist chapels; but Arundel did light a torch, and put it to his own church. Such real unpopularity as did in time attach to the old religious system, and which afterwards became a true national tradition against Mary, was doubtless started by the diseased energy of these fifteenth-century bishops. Persecution can be a philosophy, and a defensible philosophy, but with some of these men persecution was rather a perversion. Across the channel, one of them was presiding at the trial of Joan of Arc.|$|E

30|$|Constraints to sweetpotato {{production}} {{were identified}} by asking farmers to mention all the constraints they had experienced, and ranking them in order of importance of each constraint (for instance most destructive, occurs frequently) in the <b>last</b> <b>cropping</b> season. Farmers were shown colored photographs and/or vials of insects (larval and adult stages) in alcohol to ensure they made the correct identification of the pest. Farmers’ compared the perceived field resistance (level of damage) of their presently cultivated local varieties to damage by the most important insect pests.|$|R
40|$|OBJECT: Improved {{precision}} fertilization {{by introducing}} sensors and remote control to secure fruit yield and reduce nutrient leaching in soil culture. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We broadcasted before bedding and mulching 50  g m– 2 of a multi-mineral fertilizer. Beds had two plant rows 20  cm apart, with plant distance of 25  cm. Experimental design was split plot with three replications and three treatments. Treatments: fertigation in large plots, cultivar in small plots and year. RESULTS: Plant {{development in the}} establishing year had no benefit of fertigation in addition to fertilizer given before bedding. When the yield is 3  kg m– 2 a nutrient solution of 6  g N m– 2 gave highest yield, using 4  g m– 2 from two weeks before harvest and during harvest. ‘Florence’ and ‘Sonata’ developed well; however, ‘Florence’ had mildew on fruits in the <b>last</b> <b>cropping</b> year. ‘Korona’ presented well the first cropping year, but grew small fruits heavily infested by mildew in the <b>last</b> <b>cropping</b> year. CONCLUSION: Fertilization had effect on fruit yield. It is discussed how a fertilization schedule for the establishment year and cropping years {{can be adapted to}} plant development stages. Mildew infestation on fruits was dependent of cultivar and fertilization. Introducing sensors for recording of growth factors and in situ ion-levels of soil water nutrients, proved valuable...|$|R

Milligram was the fourth foal of One In A Million, the winner of the 1979 1000 Guineas, whose other foals included Someone Special, the dam of One So Wonderful. As a descendant of the broodmare Mitrailleuse, Milligram came from the same branch of Thoroughbred family 16-h which produced the St Leger winner Commanche Run and the Irish Oaks winner Swiftfoot.|$|R
