25|$|Foulois' first {{aviation}} {{assignment was}} duty with the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps, where he operated the first dirigible balloon of the U.S. Government. The {{crash of the}} Wright Military Flyer, procured {{at the same time}} by the Army on its final test flight, September 17, 1908, claimed the first US military airplane fatality, 1st Lt. Thomas E. Selfridge, and also injured Orville Wright. After one year, Foulois had concluded through his experience, understanding of military dirigibles in Europe, and talks with Tom Baldwin, that there was no military future for <b>lighter-than-air</b> <b>aircraft.</b> In expressing this opinion to the Army General Staff, Foulois recommended no more purchases of dirigibles, the first of many disagreements with the military establishment.|$|E

50|$|Key West's {{aviation}} history {{began in}} 1913, with {{a flight to}} Cuba by Augustin Parla. In 1928, Pan American Airways began scheduled flights from Key West. The main runway at Meacham Field was pressed into U.S. Army use after the Pearl Harbor attack, and into U.S. Navy use later in World War II {{as an alternative to}} the Trumbo Point seaplane base and the main Naval Air Station for fixed-wing and <b>lighter-than-air</b> (i.e., blimp) <b>aircraft</b> on Boca Chica Key. After the war, the city took over what became Key West Municipal Airport. In January 1953, the city gave Monroe County the title to Meacham Field, allowing the county to apply for Federal Aviation Administration grants. Around the same time, the airport became Key West International Airport.|$|R
40|$|Airships are <b>lighter-than-air</b> (LTA) <b>aircraft</b> {{that have}} {{historically}} been used for passenger and cargo services. However, {{since the advent of}} the Hindenburg Disaster in 1937, their use in civil aviation has been markedly limited. Airships have a number of characteristics that are unique from other aircraft and arguably may generate consumer interest for certain applications. This thesis illustrates that one potentially viable application of airships within civil aviation is scenic flights for touristic purposes. To examine consumer interest in scenic airship services, a mixed-methods approach was employed using Queenstown, New Zealand as a case study. Focus groups were used to explore broad consumer opinions relating to airships, including preferences and concerns. These opinions were quantified using a questionnaire. The focus groups and questionnaire results revealed consumer preferences with regard to activities (e. g. food and drink), airship design (e. g. facilities) {{and the nature of the}} experience (e. g. novelty), as well as concerns (e. g. safety). To present a business case, these preferences were used to design two options for a scenic airship service, both using a conceptual airship design called the Aether Concept. The first option was a 3 1 / 2 hour sightseeing tour that incorporated a meal and a drink, while the second option was an all-inclusive overnight service. A market evaluation using these two options revealed significant interest (in terms of pricing and demand) from consumers towards both options as well as the idea of performing adventure activities as part of either option. Consumer justifications for pricing and purchase decisions in the market evaluation were incorporated with the preferences and concerns from the focus groups and questionnaire to form a descriptive model that shows the motivational factors (relaxation, adventure, nature, novelty, quality, enjoyment and education) and mediating factors (location, duration, on-board activities, airship design, risk perception and price perception) that contribute towards consumer interest in scenic airship services. In addition, a new methodology for developing and testing new discontinuous products is presented and demonstrated in this thesis...|$|R

50|$|An airship or {{dirigible}} balloon {{is a type}} of aerostat or <b>lighter-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{that can}} navigate through the air under its own power. Aerostats gain their lift from large gas bags filled with a lifting gas that is less dense than the surrounding air.|$|E
50|$|A police {{aircraft}} is an rotary-wing aircraft, fixed-wing aircraft, nonrigid-wing aircraft or <b>lighter-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> used {{in police}} operations. They {{are commonly used}} for traffic control, ground support, search and rescue, high-speed car pursuits, observation, air patrol and riot control. In major cities in the United States, police helicopters are also used as air transportation for SWAT personnel.|$|E
50|$|BALÓNY KUBÍČEK {{was founded}} in 1991 by Aleš Kubíček, the {{designer}} of first modern Czech hot-air balloon, made in 1983 in Aviatik club in Brno. Before founding his own company Aleš Kubíček made several balloons under wings of the company Aerotechnik Kunovice. Straight after the Velvet revolution, with plenty of experience of manufacturing balloons, he started his own private company to manufacture <b>lighter-than-air</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first {{military}} uses {{of aviation}} involved lighter-than-air balloons. During the Battle of Fleurus in 1794, the French observation balloon l'Entreprenant {{was used to}} monitor Austrian troop movements. The use of <b>lighter-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> in warfare became prevalent in the 19th century, including regular use in the American Civil War. Lighter-than-air military aviation persisted until shortly after World War II, gradually being withdrawn from various roles as heavier-than-air aircraft improved.|$|E

50|$|Police {{aviation}} {{is the use}} of rotary-wing aircraft, fixed-wing aircraft, nonrigid-wing aircraft or <b>lighter-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{in police}} operations. Police services commonly use aircraft for traffic control, ground support, search and rescue, high-speed car pursuits, observation, air patrol and control of large-scale public events and/or public order incidents. In some major cities, police rotary-wing aircraft are also used as air transportation for personnel belonging to SWAT-style units. In large, sparsely populated areas, fixed-wing aircraft are sometimes used to transport personnel and equipment.|$|E
50|$|All {{individuals}} desiring {{flight instructor}} privileges must pass two additional written exams (fundamentals of instruction, or FOI; and a knowledge test {{specific to the}} category of aircraft in which instructional privileges are desired, such as fixed-wing) {{as well as a}} practical test.Flight instructors must be at least 18 years of age to be eligible.Those airmen who hold commercial privileges in <b>lighter-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> (balloons and airships) have flight instructor privileges in those category and classes they have on their pilot certificate. Lighter-than-air flight instructor privileges do not get placed on a flight instructor certificate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{remaining}} steel hangar {{was used}} by several manufacturing firms following the base's decommissioning in 1957, including Westinghouse and IXL Cabinetry. In 1996, an airship manufacturing company, TCOM, relocated to Elizabeth City, conducting temporary operations in a former Kmart while the hangar was refurbished and eventually returned to active service once again as a manufacturing and test facility. [...] Today, TCOM is corporately headquartered in Columbia, Maryland, while the former NAS Weeksville site {{is now known as}} the TCOM Manufacturing, Production and Test Facility for airships and aerostats and an active airfield for <b>lighter-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> operations.|$|E

50|$|From the New York Navy Yard, Wright sailed for the Philadelphia Navy Yard {{and reached}} there on 22 February 1922. After {{installation}} of her armament, the <b>lighter-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> tender departed Philadelphia on 2 March, touching at Hampton Roads, Virginia and Charleston, South Carolina {{en route to}} the Florida coast. Arriving at Key West on 11 March, Wright reported for special duty with the first division of Scouting Squadron 1 - a unit that included the seaplane NC-10 piloted by Lieutenant Clifton A. F. Sprague and a half-dozen F5L seaplanes. Three days later, the tender put to sea for operations with Scouting Division 1 out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. There, she was later joined by the six planes of Division 2 and two planes of Division 3.|$|E
50|$|Hitchcock Naval Air Station was a Naval Air Station {{built by}} the United States Navy during World War II to {{accommodate}} <b>lighter-than-air</b> <b>aircraft,</b> more commonly known as blimps. It was located {{in the small town}} of Hitchcock, Texas, about fifteen miles (24 km) northwest of Galveston. Construction began in 1942 and the base was commissioned on May 22, 1943. The most prominent feature of the base was the 1000 ft long, 200 ft tall largely wooden blimp hangar. The blimp hangar, which held six aircraft was built at a cost of $10 million. The purpose of the base and its aircraft was to search for Axis power submarines in the Gulf of Mexico. Beside the hangar there were auxiliary buildings including barracks, warehouses, a mess hall, gymnasium, auditorium and an Olympic-size swimming pool which was used to teach swimming and water-rescue.|$|E
5000|$|Different {{types of}} private {{licences}} are issued {{for the major}} categories of aircraft. It is possible to obtain a category/class rating for rotorcraft or <b>lighter-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> without ever obtaining a rating on fixed-wing aircraft. Some category/class ratings may include limitations placed on the certificate. For example, a glider pilot who has trained and tested using aerotow-, ground- or self-launch techniques will have a limitation placed on his glider rating [...] "______-launch only" [...] until he has completed additional training and a practical exam using the additional launch method(s). In similar fashion, a lighter-than-air pilot with a balloon class-rating will have the limitation [...] "limited to hot air balloons with airborne heater" [...] or [...] "limited to gas balloons" [...] unless he has logged flight training and completed a practical exam on both types of balloon. Other limitations may occasionally be issued, however these are not commonly encountered. The classes listed on the certificate define which aircraft categories its holder is qualified to operate.|$|E
5000|$|The Federal Aviation Regulations, or FARs, {{are rules}} {{prescribed}} by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) governing all aviation {{activities in the}} United States. The FARs are part of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). A wide variety of activities are regulated, such as aircraft design and maintenance, typical airline flights, pilot training activities, hot-air ballooning, <b>lighter-than-air</b> <b>aircraft,</b> man-made structure heights, obstruction lighting and marking, and even model rocket launches, model aircraft operation, sUAS & Drone operation, and kite flying. The rules are designed to promote safe aviation, protecting pilots, flight attendants, passengers {{and the general public}} from unnecessary risk. Since 1958, these rules have typically been referred to as [...] "FARs", short for Federal Aviation Regulations. However, another set of regulations (Title 48) is titled [...] "Federal Acquisitions Regulations", and this has led to confusion {{with the use of the}} acronym [...] "FAR". Therefore, the FAA began to refer to specific regulations by the term [...] "14 CFR part XX".|$|E
50|$|In 1912 the {{requirements}} and rank of Military Aviator were created for heavier-than-air aircraft pilots; {{the rank of}} Military Aeronaut was for <b>lighter-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> pilots. (Previous to this all American military pilots were certified by civilian aviation bodies). The first 24 certified pilots awarded this distinction (and the accompanying Signals Corps Military Aviator badge) were listed in War Department General Order No. 39 (May 27, 1913). This was later split in 1914 {{into the ranks of}} Student Pilot (which granted a 25% increase in pay), Junior Military Aviator (for certified Enlisted Pilots and Lieutenants, granting a 50% increase in pay) and Military Aviator (for Captains and above; granting a 75% increase in pay but also requiring 3 years of flight experience). Junior Military Aviators who participated in regular and full-time flight would be paid at the next pay grade (e.g., Flight 2nd Lieutenants would be paid the same as a 1st Lieutenant). Reserve Military Aviators had a commission in the Army Reserves; this meant they had fewer billets, a slower career progression, and less job security than Regular Army pilots.|$|E

40|$|An airship is a <b>lighter-than-air</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{that can}} be {{controlled}} and propelled through the air. The airship has been widely used today whether for commercial purposes, experimental purposes, or individual leisure pursuit purpose. The factor of low cost and easy in fabrication made it a popular airmobile unit. A team in Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) has developed an airship with 8 meters length. The team is developing the structure, envelope, gondola, fins, powerplant, flight control, navigation, telemetry, and video monitoring systems of the airship. This paper presents the research {{on the development of}} the navigation system especially the tracking system for the airship. At the first stage of the development, the airship will be steered through a radio control. Since the airship can moves around freely in the air, it is appropriate for it to have a tracking system so that the position of the airship can be monitored or even recorded at anytime or anywhere. The prototype of a GPS based navigation system for the airship has been developed. The GPS receiver chosen is Lassen iQ by Trimble. A pair of RF circuits is included to provide wireless data transmission from the GPS receiver to the ground station. An interface circuit is created to connect the RF receiver to a computer. Software is also written to parse the GPS data so that relevant information can be extracted. A visual display of the position of the airship has also being implemented in the user interface software. The system has been successfully tested and able to provide and update position data continuously...|$|E
