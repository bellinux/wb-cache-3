5|$|Soon {{after his}} birth, in {{accordance}} with the traditions of the Quraysh, Khalid was sent to a Bedouin tribe in the desert, where a foster mother nursed him and brought him up in the clear, dry and unpolluted air of the desert. At the age of five or six, he returned to his parents in Mecca. During his childhood Khalid suffered a mild attack of smallpox, which he survived, but it left some pockmarks on his <b>left</b> <b>cheek.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cleburne {{served at}} the Battle of Shiloh and the Battle of Richmond (Kentucky), where he {{was wounded in the}} face when a minie ball pierced his <b>left</b> <b>cheek,</b> smashed several teeth, and exited through his mouth, {{recovering}} in time to participate in the Battle of Perryville. After the Army of Tennessee retreated to its namesake state in late 1862, Cleburne was promoted to division command and {{served at the}} Battle of Stones River, where his division advanced three miles as it routed the Union right wing and drove it back to the Nashville Pike and its final line of defense. He was promoted to major general on December 13.|$|E
25|$|She {{had some}} {{distinctive}} markings on her body. A 2- to 6-inch scar was visible above {{one of her}} heels. Two moles on her face, one above her left eye and one on her <b>left</b> <b>cheek,</b> may have developed during her pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|In most South European countries, kissing is {{initiated}} by leaning {{to the left}} side and joining the right cheeks and if there's a second kiss, changing to the <b>left</b> <b>cheeks.</b> In some cases (e.g. some parts of Italy) the process is the opposite, you first lean to the right, join the <b>left</b> <b>cheeks</b> and then switch to the right cheeks.|$|R

25|$|On 24 March 1895, while {{negotiating}} with Japan's Prime Minister Ito Hirobumi and Foreign Affairs Minister Mutsu Munemitsu in Shimonoseki, Li {{was attacked by}} an assassin, Koyama Toyotarō (小山豐太郎), who {{shot him in the}} <b>left</b> <b>cheek.</b> Koyama was arrested by Japanese police later and he claimed that he desired for the war to continue.|$|E
25|$|Tiny {{pieces of}} fabric, known as patches, in {{the shapes of}} dots, hearts, stars, etc. were applied to the face with adhesive. The fashion {{is thought to have}} {{originated}} as a way of disguising pox scars and other blemishes, but gradually developed coded meanings. A patch near the mouth signified flirtatiousness; one on the right cheek denoted marriage; one on the <b>left</b> <b>cheek</b> announced engagement; one {{at the corner of the}} eye signified a mistress.|$|E
25|$|The {{left side}} of the lower face {{includes}} a large defect. The defect involves the Lady's <b>left</b> <b>cheek,</b> her left maxillary sinus, her alveolar process, and part of her left mandible. There are sharp edges in this bony defect, with no evidence of attempted healing or sclerosis. Fragments of the broken lateral wall of the left maxillary sinus were located within the antral cavity. Fragments for most of the Lady's fractured bones are missing, and were apparently not placed in her tomb.|$|E

25|$|The {{owner of}} the {{property}} {{said it was not}} uncommon for people to hunt there without permission. One of the men who found the remains said he saw a large bucket in the woods, which he upturned. Details of the contents have not been released. He then spotted Bobo's remains spread on the ground behind him. Investigators recovered her skull, teeth, several ribs, and one shoulder blade. Her skull had a bullet hole in the back of it on the right with the trajectory going left, fracturing her <b>left</b> <b>cheek</b> bone when it exited.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a number}} of famous life stories showing the same causal connection. For example, P. Gage was a well-respected, well-liked, and {{responsible}} gentleman. In 1848 because of a construction accident he suffered a serious damage to his brain when a metal rod propelled by an explosive entered his lower <b>left</b> <b>cheek</b> and exited from the top-middle part of his head. Gage healed quickly. After that accident, however, he became erratic, disrespectful, and vulgar. Gage had been transformed from a well-controlled, well-respected person to an individual with psychopathic traits.|$|E
25|$|González {{had a long}} scar {{across his}} <b>left</b> <b>cheek</b> that, {{according}} to his autobiography, {{some members of the}} mass media of the 1940s attributed to his being a Mexican-American pachuco and hence involved in knife fights. This was one more slur that embittered González towards the media in general. The scar was actually the result of a prosaic street accident in 1935 when he was seven years old: pushing a scooter too fast, he ran into a passing car and had his cheek gashed open by its door handle. He spent two weeks in the hospital as a result.|$|E

25|$|Cheek kissing in the Arab {{world is}} {{relatively}} common, between friends and relatives. Cheek kissing between males is very common. However, cheek kissing between {{a male and}} female is usually considered inappropriate, unless within the same family; e.g. brother and sister, or if they are a married couple. Some exceptions to this are liberal areas within cities {{in some of the}} more liberal Arab countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Tunisia, where cheek kissing is a common greeting between unrelated males and females in most communities. The Lebanese custom has become the norm for non-Lebanese in Lebanese-dominated communities of the Arab diaspora. Normally in Lebanon, the typical number of kisses is three: one on the <b>left</b> <b>cheek,</b> then right, and then left between relatives. In other countries, it is typically two kisses with one on each cheek.|$|E
25|$|In New Nightmare, Freddy's {{appearance}} is updated considerably, {{giving him a}} green fedora that matched his sweater stripes, skin-tight leather pants, knee-high black boots, a turtleneck version of his trademark sweater, a dark blue trench coat, and a fifth claw on his glove, which also has a far more organic appearance, resembling the exposed muscle tissue of an actual hand. Freddy also has fewer burns on his face, though these are more severe, with his muscle tissue exposed in numerous places. Compared to his other incarnations, this Freddy's injuries are more like those of an actual burn victim. For the 2010 remake, Freddy is returned to his iconic attire, but the burns on his face are intensified with further bleaching of the skin and exposed facial tissue on the <b>left</b> <b>cheek,</b> more reminiscent of actual third degree burns than in the original series.|$|E
500|$|Francis Albert Sinatra {{was born}} on December 12, 1915, in an upstairs {{tenement}} at 415 Monroe Street in Hoboken, New Jersey. He was {{the only child of}} Italian immigrants Antonino Martino [...] "Marty" [...] Sinatra and Natalina [...] "Dolly" [...] Garaventa. Sinatra weighed [...] at birth and had to be [...] with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his <b>left</b> <b>cheek,</b> neck, and ear, and perforated his ear drum, damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. A childhood operation on his mastoid bone left major scarring on his neck, and during adolescence he suffered from cystic acne that scarred his face and neck. Sinatra was raised Roman Catholic.|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} cut down on {{both the left and}} right sides. It was damaged in the fire that destroyed the Alcázar in 1734, and was restored by court painter Juan García de Miranda (1677–1749). The <b>left</b> <b>cheek</b> of the Infanta was almost completely repainted to compensate for a substantial loss of pigment. After its rescue from the fire, the painting was inventoried as part of the royal collection in 1747–48, and the Infanta was misidentified as Maria Theresa, Margaret Theresa's older half-sister, an error that was repeated when the painting was inventoried at the new Madrid Royal Palace in 1772. A 1794 inventory reverted to a version of the earlier title, The Family of PhilipIV, which was repeated in the [...] records of 1814. The painting entered the collection of the Museo del Prado on its foundation in 1819. In 1843, the Prado catalogue listed the work {{for the first time as}} Las Meninas.|$|E
500|$|The video premiered on October 22, 2008. It is set by a pool, {{as well as}} in a mansion. It {{begins with}} Gaga {{emerging}} from the pool wearing a mirror masquerade mask and a black sleeveless latex bodysuit with a jagged shoulder pad, with two Great Danes beside her. She throws the mask aside and the song begins with a facial shot of Gaga singing it. Gaga wears a metallic sticker on her <b>left</b> <b>cheek</b> in this shot. Featured in the video are scenes of Gaga in a mansion and dancing poolside with her dancers in a turquoise leotard. Gaga attends a wild party where every man and woman tries their luck on a strip poker game. The party gets wilder when all the party's guests strip down to their underwear, dance around, and share kisses with each other. The video also features several white mannequins on her swimming pool deck. During the musical interlude before the [...] "I won't tell you that I love you" [...] hook, Gaga is shown in her trademark [...] "Pop Music Will Never Be Low Brow" [...] sunglasses while sitting beside the pool. The video ends with the head shot of Gaga singing the Mum-mum-mum-ma hook.|$|E
500|$|Between 1927 and 1929, Hubbard {{traveled}} to Japan, China, the Philippines, and Guam. What is Scientology and other Scientology texts present this era {{as a time}} when he sought, and was freely offered, ancient Eastern wisdom but found it lacking, as he had earlier with Western science. A biographical account in Hubbard's 1982 novel Battlefield Earth says that, [...] "he worked... aboard a coastal trader which plied the seas between Japan and Java. He came to know old Shanghai, Beijing and the Western Hills at a time when few Westerners could enter China." [...] He is said to have spent weeks questioning Buddhist lamas and watching them meditate. He also recounted meeting Old Mayo, supposedly the last Chinese magician in a line that stretched back to the Court of Kublai Khan. According to the Church of Scientology, these travels were funded by his [...] "wealthy grandfather". Hubbard is described not as a tourist but as a gifted student, intensely curious for answers to human suffering and warmly received everywhere because he was perceived as special. He is purported to have faced many dangers in the company of [...] "Major Ian Macbean of the British Secret Service", including an [...] "encounter with Cantonese pirates, the engineering of a jungle road across Guam's denser corner, and the evening he decked an Italian swordsman named Giovinni. (Although not before he took a saber cut across the <b>left</b> <b>cheek,</b> and Macbean nearly lost a hand)." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also {{during the}} 1960s, a local Bostonian named Tony Conigliaro slugged 24 home runs as an 18-year-old rookie in 1964. [...] "Tony C" [...] became the {{youngest}} player in Major League Baseball to hit his 100th home run, a record that stands today. [...] However, he was struck just above the <b>left</b> <b>cheek</b> bone by a fastball thrown by Jack Hamilton in August 1967. Conigliaro sat out the entire next season with headaches and blurred vision and although {{he did have a}} productive season in 1970, he was never the same.|$|E
2500|$|... was {{a former}} Furniture of Iason, and Iason's {{right-hand}} man in the black market. A computer genius, he almost uncovered {{what he calls the}} [...] "Secrets of Tanagura" [...] during time as Iason's Furniture, but was caught in the act by Iason, who punished him by slashing his <b>left</b> <b>cheek,</b> which earned him a scar that he usually covers with his hair. Although he respects Riki, he is willing to take part in Iason's plans to make Riki return to Iason by manipulating Kirie. Despite his cool, seemingly uncaring nature, he cares for both Iason and Riki deeply and tries his best to look after both of them. In the audio book, he is voiced by Hōchū Ōtsuka. In the 1990s OVAs, he is voiced by Hideyuki Tanaka. In the later drama CDs and remake OVAs, he is voiced by Shin-ichiro Miki.|$|E
2500|$|Assigned by General Lee to {{hold the}} vital sunken road, or [...] "Bloody Lane", during the Battle of Antietam, Gordon's {{propensity}} for being wounded reached new heights. First, a Minié ball passed through his calf. Then, a second ball hit him higher in the same leg. A third ball went through his left arm. He continued to lead his men {{despite the fact that}} the muscles and tendons in his arm were mangled and a small artery was severed. A fourth ball hit him in his shoulder. Despite pleas that he go to the rear, he continued to lead his men. He was finally stopped by a ball that hit him in the face, passing through his <b>left</b> <b>cheek</b> and out his jaw. He fell with his face in his cap and might have drowned in his own blood if it had not drained out through a bullet hole in the cap. A Confederate surgeon thought he would not survive but after he was returned to Virginia, he was nursed back to health by his wife.|$|E
40|$|Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis are {{obligatory}} parasites {{that live}} in sebaceous glands and follicles. When immune system becomes suppressed by any reason, patients become vulnerable to obligatory parasites like D. folliculorum and D. brevis. Immune system becomes suppressed in cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy, {{and as a result}} these patients become vulnerable to infestations. In our case, a 45 year-old female has been admitted to oncology clinic for a medical treatment of breast cancer. Her systematic physical examination was normal, except redness on her cheeks and forehead. There was no abnormality in biochemical and haematological laboratory values. We have decided to apply chemotherapy of Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and 5 -fluorouracil. Due to the itchy redness on her cheeks and forehead, we had performed an examination for demodex before chemotherapy; and we have identified 20 mites/cm 2 on her right and <b>left</b> <b>cheeks,</b> and 15 mites/cm 2 on her forehead. When our patient had came our clinic with increasing complaint of itchy rash, after the first course of chemotherapy we have reexamined demodex. The result of microscopic examination revealed large amount of demodex of 50 mites/cm 2 on her right and <b>left</b> <b>cheeks</b> and 30 mites/cm 2 on her forehead, which were nearly 2. 5 -times higher than the previous examination. This increase probably was associated with immune suppression of chemotherapy...|$|R

The drops, which had at first hit their <b>left</b> <b>cheeks</b> like the pellets of a popgun, soon assumed {{the character of a}} raking fusillade from the bank adjoining, one shot of which was sufficiently smart to go through Jocelyn's sleeve.
