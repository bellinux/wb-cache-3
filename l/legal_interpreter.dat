40|$|The corpus we want {{to examine}} is a very {{specific}} and rather exceptional one: it is an authentic video recording of a court case in Belgium (Flanders). More specifically, it concerns a hearing of a witness via videoconferencing (VC). The hearing took place between Brussels (Belgium) and Innsbruck (Austria). The interpreter is a <b>legal</b> <b>interpreter</b> for Dutch, based in Austria, sitting in a courtroom equipped with VC equipment, while the witness is in Brussels accompanied by a prosecutor, a police officer and a technician. The case was a supposedly simple testimony in an assault case during a skiing holiday in the Austrian Alps. The technical conditions were tested the day before so that everything was prepared to make the hearing run smoothly. Nevertheless, this routine hearing {{turned out to be}} a failure with a lot of frustration and anger on both sides because of the bad quality of the interaction, and the lack of professionalism of both the <b>legal</b> <b>interpreter</b> and the legal professionals. The actual length of the hearing exceeded the estimated length (i. e. 20 minutes) and took almost 5 times as long. This timing clearly points at a low degree of efficiency. In our chapter, we would like to present a transcription of (part of) the interaction. We will focus on the main reasons for this failing interaction. -We will present a quantitative analysis of the number of interpreting errors (to be defined as omissions, additions and problems with accuracy) but also of linguistic problems and problematic paralinguistic items like turn-taking and overlap. We also want to analyze the audio-visual parameters (e. g. both technical and visual (gaze)). Finally, we will pay attention to the behavior of the legal professionals (ethical code and professionalism). A striking example shows that the Austrian legal professionals tried to behave during the VC session as if it were a face-to-face setting, without realizing that - except for the magistrate and the <b>legal</b> <b>interpreter</b> - nobody was visible for the participants on the Belgian side. Our ultimate aim is to compare our findings based on this real case with the results of the Avidicus 1 & 2 project. We would like to compare the simulated role-plays of Avidicus 1 & 2 with our real case. In the Avidicus roleplay, the interpreter and the legal professional are in the same place while the witness is at a remote location. It would be interesting to find out whether the results will be similar or rather divergent. In the end, we will discuss methodological issues (simulations and experiments vs. real life case studies) but we will also try to formulate recommendations for both legal professionals and legal interpreters on how to handle VC hearings, based on the case study.

40|$|The {{training}} of <b>legal</b> <b>interpreters</b> and translators at the KULeuven Campus Antwerp already exists for 16 years.

The initiative for this joint training – the lecturers are {{representatives from the}} court, police, bar association, and professors of translation- and interpreting studies - {{was taken by the}} court of Antwerp which formulated the need for high-quality <b>legal</b> translators and <b>interpreters.</b> In our presentation we will on the one hand stress the unique form of cooperation between the two types of the stakeholders e. g. academics and professionals, and explain the training as such. On the other hand we want to give an example of which kind of challenges we are facing when we have to train a candidate with an ‘exotic language’. The research project TraiLLD (Training in Languages of Lesser Diffusion) (JUST/ 2013 /JPEN/AG/ 4594, funded by the European Commission, Directorate-General for Justice) focuses on the {{training of}} <b>legal</b> <b>interpreters,</b> and particularly on those <b>legal</b> <b>interpreters</b> who speak an ‘exotic’ language. The rationale is twofold. Firstly, the project team mapped the current situation regarding the different methodological training frameworks covered by the different project partners. In our presentation we will give an overview of these different methodological frameworks. Secondly, based on a collection of best practices of these different methodological frameworks, we developed a new training methodology and strategy to enable speakers of a Language of Lesser Diffusion (LLD) to become <b>legal</b> <b>interpreters</b> after a short, intense period of training. This new training method is now in the pilot phase. In our presentation, we will discuss the example of joint training sessions for Mongolian-Dutch (set up by KU Leuven and SIGV), which are on the one hand an excellent illustration of international cooperation and cross-border training {{and on the other hand}} a decent model for combining a traditional face-to-face course with the usage of new technologies such as e-learning and internet-based training for legal interpreting students. We will address the difficulties and challenges, which we were faced with during the start-up of the training course and the entrance exam. How do you for instance find an assessor for Mongolian in Europe? How can you offer exercises in this particular language, if there are no peers in the group with the same language combination? How can we provide enough training material for the Mongolian students? In our presentation, we will offer possible solutions for this kind of problems. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates legal interpreters’ {{perception}} of their roles in the British judicial system through three steps. The exploration began with legal interpreters’ role, which is the vital foundation of legal interpreting. Then, the definition, constitution, and approaches of <b>legal</b> <b>interpreter’s</b> main role, providing accurate and faithful renditions of original utterances, were explored. The investigation ended with the most prominent moral dilemmas and practical difficulties obstructing legal interpreters’ effective delivery of their role. Data is collected through a mixed methods approach using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with qualified interpreters on the National Register of Public Service Interpreters (NRPSI) and written interviews with six legal practitioners. Findings reveal that communication facilitator and faithful renderer of original utterances were the best descriptions of the <b>legal</b> <b>interpreter’s</b> role, {{according to their own}} perceptions. However, understanding of this aspect and the establishment of a clear professional status of interpreters have not been achieved across the British judicial system. Interpreters in this study were in general agreement on the concept of accurate interpretation and faithful reflection of the main linguistic content as well as the original pragmatic strength in the target language rendition. However, they reported divided views regarding the treatment of each pragmatic element of speech. Reflections on difficulties fall into five main areas of insufficient contextual information, linguistic challenges, complicated legal procedure, lack of understanding of the interpreting profession and emotional challenges. However, various parties in the current legal context have not recognised these difficulties. Interpreters pointed out the importance of addressing these issues in the training process for both <b>interpreters</b> and <b>legal</b> practitioners and setting up an interpreter support regime. Findings may help to identify gaps in the existing certification process and training courses helping <b>legal</b> <b>interpreters</b> to be equipped with knowledge and solutions to be better prepared for various challenging situations...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} situation of legal interpreting in Italy. The aim is to describe the legislative framework of the linguistic assistance provided in this area in Italy, point out the shortcomings {{in the provision of}} this service, including the difficulties faced by <b>legal</b> <b>interpreters,</b> and investigate whether the Italian legislation on the matter is correctly applied in the city of Arezzo by interviewing people who work with <b>legal</b> <b>interpreters</b> in police stations, courthouses and the prison. Chapter 1 aims to give an overview on the presence of non-Italian speaking people in Italy, such as foreign residents, foreign tourists and migrants. There follows a description of {{the situation of}} foreign-born arrestees. Chapter 2 focuses on the legal framework of the linguistic assistance provided in Italian legal settings. It contains an analysis of the articles of several Codes of Criminal Procedure in force in different historical states of Italy that refer to the position of the interpreter, and {{a detailed description of the}} current legislation. Chapter 3 analyses the most frequent difficulties acknowledged by the interpreters, as well as several problems arising due to an incomplete implementation of the EU directives in Italy’s legislation. Chapter 4 deals with the situation of legal interpreting in Arezzo. Interviews were carried out with people who work frequently with interpreters in the city’s police stations, courthouses and prison. Moreover, the person in charge of the service of cultural mediation in the city was also interviewed. The problems acknowledged by the interviewees are presented. Chapter 5 describes the training projects promoted by the European Union. Two proposals are then made, aimed at improving the linguistic assistance provided in legal settings: to offer specific training courses and to create a national register for <b>legal</b> <b>interpreters...</b>|$|R
40|$|In cross-examination, {{questions}} {{are used by}} counsel strategically to maintain control over witness testimony. In a bilingual courtroom where communication is interpreted, {{it is crucial that}} lawyers' intended questioning strategies be adequately relayed from one language to another. Failure to do so can affect the effectiveness of courtroom questioning and potentially even the outcome of a case. However, achieving such a high level of accuracy is an extremely complex task due to the intricacy of courtroom discourse. Previous studies on the interpretation of courtroom questions have demonstrated interpreters' inadvertent modifications of the pragmatics of courtroom questioning. However, most of these studies are based on English-Spanish courtroom data; interpreters' influence on courtroom questions in other language pairs is rarely investigated. This thesis, therefore, focuses on interpreting cross-examination questions from English to Chinese. More specifically, it investigates the most common pragmalinguistic challenges for achieving accuracy and the role of specialised <b>legal</b> <b>interpreter</b> training in improving accuracy. This thesis, adopting a mixed-methods approach, consists of two components: a discourse analytical study on student interpreters' pragmatic accuracy in a moot court exercise and a quasi-experiment with I&T Master’s students at UNSW. Findings show that it can be challenging to produce pragmatically accurate renditions. Chinese interpreted questions have an overall weakened illocutionary force compared to the original English questions. Declaratives, reported speech declaratives, modal interrogatives, and tag {{questions are}} particularly difficult to interpret into Chinese. Some of the pragmatic shifts are related to the inherent cross-linguistic differences and some occurred despite the similarities between the two languages. Such pragmalinguistic challenges can be addressed by specialised <b>legal</b> <b>interpreter</b> training. Results of the quasi-experiment show that specialised training is conducive to improving interpreters' pragmatic accuracy, that is, interpreters who receive more training tend to perform better on accuracy than those who receive less. This thesis is steeped in a number of research areas: legal interpreting, forensic linguistics, and interpreter training. It not only fills the gap in the knowledge of interpreting courtroom questions from English to Chinese but also has important implications for the education of legal interpreters...|$|E
40|$|For decades, while {{approaching}} the ‘normativism/pragmatism’ divide and discussing {{the legitimacy of}} (and opportunity for) the judge {{to act as a}} ‘social engineer’, socio-legal scholars have tried to ascertain whether the jurist should also consider the impact of his/her activity on society at large, and if so, why and to what extent. The present contribution understands instead the law in terms of a structurally incomplete image (imago veritas falsa) which always needs the decisive intervention of the <b>legal</b> <b>interpreter</b> to exercise its performative instances. In particular, by adopting an unconventional theoretico-philosophical approach that transcends the classic boundaries of foundationalist metaphysics as expressed by the dichotomy of Western logic, this paper argues for the necessity of a tertium comparationis capable of explaining that the real essence of law, legal reasoning, and judging is neither that of normativism, nor of pragmatism, but rather of (post-) Schmittian decisionism...|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to increasing mobility and migration in Europe, the European Directive 2010 / 64 /EU on strengthening {{the rights to}} interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings has highlighted the importance of quality in legal translation and interpreting. At the same time, the economic situation is putting pressure on public services and translation/interpreting service providers alike, jeopardizing quality standards and fair access to justice. With regard to interpreting, the use of videoconference technology is now being widely considered as a potential solution for gaining cost-effective and timely access to qualified <b>legal</b> <b>interpreters.</b> However, this gives rise to many questions, including: how technological mediation through videoconferencing affects the quality of interpreting; how this {{is related to the}} actual videoconference setting and the distribution of participants; and ultimately whether the different forms of video-mediated interpreting are sufficiently reliable for legal communication. It is against this backdrop that the AVIDICUS Project (2008 - 11), co-funded by the European Commission’s Directorate-General Justice, set out to research the quality and viability of video-mediated interpreting in criminal proceedings.

40|$|This paper {{wants to}} {{illustrate}} how research and training, theory and practice go hand in hand. The main goal {{of this paper is}} to describe how the actual LIT (<b>Legal</b> <b>Interpreters</b> and Translators) training programme at the KU Leuven Arts faculty in Antwerp is the result of a number of research programmes that were initiated by prof. dr. Erik Hertog in the late nineties of the last century and took place in collaboration with the European Commission, more specifically DG Justice and several partners in different EU Member States. We will show how the GROTIUS projects (started in 1998) have laid the foundations of the awareness that equal access to Justice is not an evidence, especially when people involved in criminal cases are not speaking the language of the judicial system where they will be heard. The idea that joint efforts and exchanging best practices to assure quality and quality control were the best way to move forward eventually gave shape to the AGIS projects and gave in 2009 birth to EULITA, the European <b>Legal</b> <b>Interpreters</b> and Translators Association. This ever-broadening European view and growing awareness on the professionalization of LITs made that many professionals involved in legal proceedings were not only willing to collaborate, but they also realized that future developments had to be taken in account. Research projects then start(ed) to focus on new technologies or further development and specialization in LITs training.

40|$|A summative test {{at the end}} of {{a course}} is a useful and (very) {{well-known}} tool to test the competences of a would-be professional of any kind. However, in the last decades, much has been written on test design and assessment procedures which makes testing less obvious than it seems. When the testing process becomes more difficult like in interpreting (because of the “fleeting” nature of the process), and even more complex when some of the assessors are not at all used to being involved in assessment procedures, we are talking about assessing legal interpreting by means of a faithful role play where the would-be <b>legal</b> <b>interpreter</b> has to act as an interpreter. The lifelike character (of the role play) lies among other things in one of the role players being a (real) legal actor (police officer, a judge or a lawyer). The other role player (the suspect, witness or victim) is a native speaker of the foreign language, mostly a language teacher or trainer. Recently, the legal interpreting assessment procedure at KU Leuven/Thomas More Antwerp (former Lessius) has been completely reviewed. In our presentation we will discuss and concretely illustrate the following issues: - The validity of the test i. e. the role play: the test design is of utmost importance and the role play has to be a valid tool to decide on the pass or fail for the future legal interpreter: we will explain how the role plays have been designed to test specific competences. - The reliability of the test procedure: once the role play has been written, the whole procedure must be prepared and then assessed in a reliable way by the assessors. In this already complex scenario, we are also confronted with extra challenges such as the fact that – due to budgetary constraints– the role players are assessors at the same time. Moreover, at least one of the assessors does not work in a didactical or pedagogical context (the legal actor). Although the second assessor is, in most cases, a language trainer used to doing assessments and specialized in legal terminology and/or with some legal knowledge, this can’t be fully guaranteed (especially for LLD, languages of lesser diffusion). This means the assessors have to be clearly briefed: we will explain how we deal with this briefing by showing in detail the extensive information assessors receive to fulfill their task properly. After all they have to be able to fairly decide on pass or fail. Since this procedure has been introduced recently, this is work in progress where the research on the assessment procedure itself is in a starting phase only. Although we cannot yet promise strong and quantitatively powerful results, the basic research question we want to answer is whether the new procedure results in more pass or more fail judgments.

This ‘common good’ consists, on the one hand, of those elements of the nine conceptions (or their methodological foundations) which are common, e. g. an assumption that the subject of interpretation is a legal text, or an assumption that a legal text has a normative character, and those other elements of those conceptions which have been sufficiently justified either in science or in the attitudes of <b>legal</b> <b>interpreters,</b> and subsequently reviewed in judicial decisions (e. g. three types of interpretation and the order in which they are applied) ...|$|R

40|$|Because of the {{scarcity}} of training opportunities in legal interpreting, and the non-existence of training in video-mediated legal interpreting per se, both {{from the point of}} view of the <b>legal</b> <b>interpreters</b> themselves, and that of the legal professionals who work with interpreters, the AVIDICUS Project included as one of its core objectives to devise and pilot three training modules on video-mediated interpreting: one for legal practitioners, including the police; one for interpreters working in the legal services; and one for interpreting students. This chapter presents the three training modules, designed and developed by the AVIDICUS Project. Following a discussion of the background context to the need for training and the technological of such training, the module for student interpreters is presented, followed by the legal interpreters’ module, and finally the module aimed at legal practitioners and police officers...|$|R

40|$|As Erika Fischer-Lichte remarked, {{the great}} Polish theatre theorist Jerzy Grotowski redefined {{the notion of}} the body of the actor as an {{embodied}} mind, as a responsive and responding self. Conversely, law abjures the body, its interpreters – lawyers and scholars – inured in practices of rationality, reason and logic, or mindful disembodiment. Travelling through the Danish capital, encountering Danes real and fictitious to illustrate how much we function through our bodies, this essay suggests that we are better and more effective <b>legal</b> <b>interpreters</b> as embodied minds, rather than disembodied minds. But this is not mindless embodiment, a mere reflex or bodily outburst. The embodied mind is self-aware (physically, socially, intellectually) and possesses the same embodied virtuous morality held by Grotowski’s actors. Reminiscent of Kierkegaard’s uniting of the mind-body divide, this connected mind and body challenges the Augustinian negation of the body and associated interpretative assumptions inherited over centuries of legal thought...|$|R
40|$|The most {{elaborate}} and up-to-date research on training interpreters in Languages of Lesser Diffusion is brought {{together in this}} book. The number of foreign language speakers involved in criminal proceedings has quadrupled over the last thirty years. In many of these cases,the person's native language was an LLD (Language of Lesser Diffusion) : a language that has relatively few speakers in one specific location or geographical area {{in relation to the}} population as a whole. These {{people have the right to}} be addressed in their own language. The need for <b>legal</b> <b>interpreters</b> and translators of LLDs is therefore grate, and still rising. Given the particular characteristics of this type of languages, specific methodologies and programmes are required for LLD interpretr training. Existing strategies in organizing training were analyzed by the TraiLLD consortium in order to test their efficiency, to improve them, and to develop alternative approaches. The result is an evidence-based set of practical recommendations, brought together in one volume. nrpages: 224 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Videoconference (VC) {{systems have}} been used in courts in England and Wales for more than fifteen years. However, {{it can be argued that}} {{research}} into how new technologies and <b>interpreters</b> interact in <b>legal</b> settings is still in its infancy. The aim of this article is to analyse whether court interpreters perceive their role differently when they interpret through VC systems, and whether the location (i. e. if they are present in court or in prison) has an impact upon their perception. This article will adopt an innovative approach by using Actor-Network Theory (ANT), and more precisely the sociological construct of Translation. This framework will be applied to three interviews that were conducted with practising <b>legal</b> <b>interpreters</b> in the UK. It will be posited that interpreters create small networks in an interpreted communicative event, in which they Translate only some of the court actors. To do so, they deploy various devices to influence and rally the other actors behind the interpreters’ perceptions of their roles. It will also be argued that although Translation has rarely been applied in Translation and Interpreting Studies, it offers new, innovative avenues for research in Interpreting Studies, especially when new technologies are under scrutiny...|$|R

The Polish Society of Sworn and Specialised Translators TEPISThe curriculum of a post-graduate course at the Adam Mickiewicz University has been prepared after an analysis of translation problems occurring in EU legal translations into Polish. An introduction to civil law, commercial law, civil procedure, penal law and penal procedure has {{been included in the}} curriculum. A Polish language course has also been introduced as the analysis also revealed that many errors result from insufficient knowledge of the mother tongue. The course includes legal translation strategies and methodology, and also solutions for the most frequently occurring grammatical, stylistic and punctuation problems. Students are acquainted with the rules recommended by the Sworn Translators' Code and the macrostructure of legal texts formulated in Polish and foreign languages and also non-legal texts translated for courts, the public prosecution service and the police. The presentation is intended to show methods applied by legal translation teachers of various pairs of languages to overcome the main translation problems with special emphasis placed on avoiding fatal errors. 201424625...|$|R
40|$|In Spain the {{increase}} in minorities who speak different languages and come from different cultures has, on a social level, {{given rise to a}} growing sense of concern with regard to their integration into society, and, at the judicial level, when it comes to regulating their stay in the country. However, in my opinion, there is one aspect that is being overlooked in official circles: the lack of attention to the immigrants' linguistic problems and the need for competent interpreters. First, I will analyze a few examples of legal translation and interpretation taken from court rooms; then, I will explain briefly some programs on community interpreting, and will analyze the role of the interpreter as well, the result of which could wind up causing a different or even the opposite social/psychological effect on the receiver. I will make references, primarily, to United States federal, state, and municipal court cases because it is there that a Spanish-English interpreter is most often needed, for the very fact that Spanish is the most widely spoken language after the official language. All of this is done with the idea of calling attention to the need for the creation of training programs for <b>legal</b> <b>interpreters...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article takes a very {{different}} path through which to explore the challenges affecting and shaping innovation and communications law. It reports on a facet of an empirical pilot study into generational differences in legal interpretation that revealed the porosity and friability of doctrine. The article focuses on one facet of the study apposite to this special issue: a fleeting reference by Finkelstein J to icons of pop culture in an otherwise unremarkable passing off I misleading and deceptive conduct case - Hansen v Bickfords - involving the marketing of an energy drink. As the responses of lawyer and law student participants to these references show, the courts and <b>legal</b> <b>interpreters</b> draw on a reserve of tacit knowledge through which their reading and {{the interpretation of the}} law is filtered. The explicit reference in a judgment to such tacit knowledge (in the form of the pop cultural) allows us to glimpse the ways in which technocratic law is read through a range of filters that are presumed to form no {{part of the process of}} legal interpretation, revealing just how generationally inflected legal interpretation is, showing how much haphazard, everyday misconceptions and trivialities can actively shape the understanding and deployment of law by its practitioners...|$|R
