40|$|The {{mechanism}} of pectin gelation {{depends on the}} degree of methoxylation. High methoxyl pectin gels due to hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding between pectin molecules. Low methoxyl pectin forms gels in the presence of di- and polyvalent cations which cross link and neutralise the negative charges of the pectin molecule. Monovalent cations normally do not <b>lead</b> to <b>gel</b> formation with high methoxyl pectin solutions free of divalent cations, especially Ca. The present study found that alkali (NaOH or KOH) added to high methoxyl pectin <b>leads</b> to <b>gel</b> formation in a concentration-depended manner. It was also found that monovalent cations (Na and K) induce gelation of low methoxyl pectin and the time required for gel formation (setting time) depends on the cation concentration. The results indicate that a combined char-e neutralisation and ionic strength effect is responsible for the monovalent cation-induced gelation of pectin. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|An organogel is a {{class of}} gel {{composed}} of a liquid organic phase within a three-dimensional, cross-linked network. Organogel networks can form in two ways. The first is classic gel network formation via polymerization. This mechanism converts a precursor solution of monomers with various reactive sites into polymeric chains that grow into a single covalently-linked network. At a critical concentration (the gel point), the polymeric network becomes large enough so that on the macroscopic scale, the solution starts to exhibit gel-like physical properties: an extensive continuous solid network, no steady-state flow, and solid-like rheological properties. However, organogels that are “low molecular weight gelators” can also be designed to form gels via self-assembly. Secondary forces, such as van der Waals or hydrogen bonding, cause monomers to cluster into a non-covalently bonded network that retains organic solvent, and as the network grows, it exhibits gel-like physical properties. Both gelation mechanisms <b>lead</b> to <b>gels</b> characterized as organogels.|$|R

A critical concentration for the measured system was observed at 20 wt. % montmorillonite, where a crossover to a gel-like structure was detected. The observed gel has a rubber plateau, which develops further with higher montmorillonite concentration.

The large fraction of air trapped in the bed and the uniform radial spreading of the imbibition front indicate considerable heterogeneity of bed on the microscopic scale, but a homogenous structure on the macroscopic scale.
