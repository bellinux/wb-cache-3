These innovations have provided benefits in terms of reduced environmental impact and increased living standards. Textile production today is largely dominated by cotton, even though this commodity has an extraordinary impact in terms of cultivated yields, pesticide and <b>liquid</b> <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application,</b> water consumption, and pollution. In addition, it has had negative impacts in terms of employmentconditions and labor standards in those countries where cotton is produced and processed. The types and mix of fibers chosen during production are closely related to the environmental impact of the textile and clothing sector in terms of the significant amount of water and land used, as well as the use of pesticides and fertilizers, which contribute to terrestrial eco-toxicity and marine and freshwater eutrophication. In contrast, a substantial majority of human toxicity and freshwater and marine eco-toxicity results from the use of the produced materials...|$|E

Therefore a field study was conducted to evaluate the effects of manure application rate and method of application on soil erosion and P loss with runoff water and sediment. Simulated rainfall was applied to 24 runoff plots to study two variables in triplicate. The first variable was application rate: liquid swine manure was applied at N recommended rate and twice the rate, and inorganic liquid fertilizer with P level that matches the amount of P supplied by manure. The second variable was placement, with manure or fertilizer either surface broadcast or incorporated;Average total runoff flow volume was found to be significantly greater for the broadcast method of manure application in comparison with the incorporated treatment. Average total runoff flow volume was also found to be greater for <b>liquid</b> <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> treatment in comparison with manure treatment. Total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations and mass losses in runoff water were significantly greater for the liquid fertilizer treatment in comparison with manure treatment;Concentrations and total losses of all P forms with runoff water were significantly greater for fertilizer treatment in comparison with manure. These losses were significantly less when manure or fertilizer was incorporated. Concentrations of all P forms were significantly greater for the higher rates of application, but similar effects on mass losses were only found for total phosphorus, particulate phosphorus, and bioavailable phosphorus (BAP). Soil test for P (STP) by agronomic and environmental tests showed that dissolved P (DP) and BAP concentrations in runoff water were best predicted by Bray 1 -P or iron oxide strip-P in soil.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model {{was developed to}} describe in-canopy vertical distribution of ammonia (NH(3)) sources and sinks and vertical fluxes in a fertilized agricultural setting using measured in-canopy mean NH(3) concentration and wind speed profiles. This model was applied to quantify in-canopy air-surface exchange rates and above-canopy NH(3) fluxes in a fertilized corn (Zea mays) field. Modeled air-canopy NH(3) fluxes agreed well with independent above-canopy flux estimates. Based on the model results, the urea fertilized soil surface was a consistent source of NH(3) one month following the <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application,</b> whereas the vegetation canopy was typically a net NH(3) sink with the lower portion of the canopy being a constant sink. The model results suggested that the canopy was a sink for some 70 % of the estimated soil NH(3) emissions. A logical conclusion is that parametrization of within-canopy processes in air quality models are necessary to explore the impact of agricultural field level management practices on regional air quality. Moreover, there are agronomic and environmental benefits to timing <b>liquid</b> <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applications</b> as close to canopy closure as possible. Finally, given the large within-canopy mean NH(3) concentration gradients in such agricultural settings, {{a discussion about the}} suitability of the proposed model is also presented...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decades the {{upcoming}} shortage of mineral oil caused intense public debates and research {{efforts on the}} subject of alternative fuels and the recycling of plastics. The limited availability of environmentally compatible fertilizer for food production purposes attracted much less public interest, but is of equal importance. C. R. O. P. is a sustainable concept for the improvement of organic wastes and wastewaters, which combines microbial trickling filters for waste processing with hydroponic plant cultivation {{on the basis of the}} resulting nutrient containing solutions. Although the trickling filters are designed as waste processing plants for closed environment systems in the first place, they are also suitable for nutrient recycling in modern hydroponic greenhouse culture. Wet composting of plant wastes comprises two steps, the first of which is the liquefaction of the solid parts and the second the mineralization of the organic matter. These processes require the presence of several microbial species with differing environmental demands. To enable the simultaneous growth of the necessary organisms in one filter unit, the filter medium has to provide the corresponding habitats. Therefore, our trickling filters contain porous lava rock as filter medium. The small pores of the lava particles form different habitat zones under the growth of the biofilm in which the outer layers provide oxic habitats for aerobic bacteria and anoxic habitats for anaerobic bacteria. Presently, three full-scale trickling filters of the type described with special adaptations for solids processing located at Campus Klein-Altendorf of the University of Bonn are in operation. Each filter unit consists of a tank that contains 800 l of water and a filter that contains 250 l of lava. The water is constantly circulated through the lava filter. Between 5 to 15 kg of shredded plant wastes were added every fortnight to the water (total amount approx. 120 kg). The waste was carried along in the flow, thus also passing the filter, and was liquefied within days. The process resulted in a clear and almost completely odour-free solution. After determination of mass concentrations of inorganic compounds by ion exchange chromatography the solution is used as stock solution for <b>liquid</b> <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> in growth tests, which are currently in progress. To date we can state that nutrients, especially micronutrients, have to be added when the filter units are solely fed with plant wastes but the consumption of conventional fertilizer is reduced...|$|E

For <b>liquid</b> <b>fertilizers,</b> variable-orifice nozzles are being implemented since they provide a much larger nozzle flow range compared to traditional fixed orifice nozzles. However, understanding the performance of variable-orifice nozzles under different field operating conditions has been limited. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performance of variable orifice nozzles in support of variable-rate application. Two common variable-orifice nozzles offered by different companies were selected for this study. They were tested over three flow ranges (0. 76 to 1. 89 L/min) with all tests replicated three times. A commercially available 18. 6 -m, wet boom sprayer equipped with 37 nozzle bodies was used. Nozzles were numbered but then randomly assigned a position along the boom. To evaluate the performance of an individual nozzle, three random nozzle locations along the spray boom were established for both sets of nozzles. Therefore, 18 tests per replication were required to include the 3 flow rates, 3 different locations, and 2 nozzle types. Once the desired flow rate test was established, tip flow was measured using SpotOn Sprayer Calibrator technology. Tip flows were recorded and statistical analyses performed to evaluate flow uniformity (CV) across the boom but also detect off-rate errors by individual nozzles and locations across the boom. With the exception of a few nozzles, the uniformity across the spray boom, as defined by the CV, was acceptable for both nozzle types over approximately a 2 : 1 flow range. Both nozzle types were less uniform at the low flow rate. There were three nozzles of each type that resulted in unacceptable flow errors in multiple tests. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers...|$|R
