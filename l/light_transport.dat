5|$|Following the {{retirement}} of the Caribou from service in 2009, No. 38 Squadron was re-equipped with eight Beechcraft King Air 350 aircraft. The squadron is currently stationed at RAAF Base Townsville, Queensland, and is responsible for training RAAF pilots to operate King Airs, and performing <b>light</b> <b>transport</b> tasks. It is also believed to have a ground surveillance capability.|$|E
5|$|As of 2011 the police's new {{patrol cars}} are four-wheel drive Volkswagen Passat with {{automatic}} transmission. New transport cars are Mercedes-Benz Vito for <b>light</b> <b>transport</b> and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter for heavy transport. The police force operates two Eurocopter EC135 helicopters, {{which are based}} at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. In addition, the Emergency Response Unit can use the Royal Norwegian Air Force's Bell 412 helicopters.|$|E
5|$|No. 38 Squadron is {{currently}} {{responsible for providing}} conversion training on the King Air and conducting <b>light</b> <b>transport</b> operations. The unit has a strength of 60 RAAF personnel as well as 25 aircraft maintenance contractors from Hawker Pacific. It is organised into two flights; A Flight undertakes transport operations, and B Flight is responsible for delivering training courses. Along with Nos. 33 and 36 Squadrons, No. 38 Squadron forms part of No. 86 Wing.|$|E

5|$|In 1981 the Australian Government {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} a RAAF fighter squadron from Malaysia to Darwin pending {{the completion of}} RAAF Base Tindal near Katherine in the Northern Territory. No.75 Squadron was the unit selected, and it arrived in Darwin in October 1983, becoming the first fighter squadron to be permanently based in the Northern Territory since World War II. The unit began to convert to F/A-18Hornets in May 1988 and moved to Tindal in October that year. No.75 Squadron also became part of No.81 Wing during 1988. Tindal {{was close to the}} RAAF's newly developed Delamere Air Weapons Range and the squadron was assigned two GAF Nomad <b>light</b> <b>transport</b> aircraft between January 1989 and 1993 to fly supplies to the facilities there.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1981, the Indian {{government}} set up {{a committee}} to study its own requirements for a <b>light</b> <b>transport</b> aircraft. Based upon this competition, the Bhutanese government ordered one Dornier 228-200 for delivery in January 1983, with the option for a second aircraft for delivery in late 1983. The first 18-seat Dornier 228-200 landed at Paro Airport on 14 January 1983, the exact time of landing, the number of passengers on board and even the direction the aircraft was parked on the airport apron being predetermined by the high lama of Paro Dzong.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF {{has been}} {{pleased with the}} King Air's {{performance}} in the <b>light</b> <b>transport</b> role, though the aircraft cannot be deployed into combat areas. No. 38 Squadron often operates with the Army's Townsville-based 3rd Brigade, {{as well as the}} 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment, which conducts operational patrols across Far North Queensland during peacetime. The unit is also frequently tasked with transporting senior politicians and other VIPs. The King Airs often operate in Papua New Guinea, as well as other parts of the Asia-Pacific region. The Australian Government ordered 10 Alenia C-27J Spartan battlefield transports in May 2012, and these aircraft will be operated by No. 35 Squadron from 2015. No. 38 Squadron marked its 70th anniversary in 2013, and has the longest period of continual operation of any of the RAAF's flying squadrons.|$|E

5|$|The RAAF used Vengeance {{aircraft}} for {{a variety}} of tasks following their withdrawal from combat roles. The type was operated by Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 Communication Units, which were responsible for <b>light</b> <b>transport</b> and training tasks. No. 1 Air Performance Unit employed Vengeances as target tugs and for trials purposes. No. 7 Operational Training Unit, which was responsible for converting aircrew to Liberator bombers, was issued with Vengeance target tugs. Vengeances were also used in trials of poison gas conducted by the 1st Australian Field Experimental Station, Royal Australian Engineers, near Proserpine, Queensland, during 1944. In May 1944, Vengeances from No. 21 Squadron were used to impersonate German Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers during the production of the movie The Rats of Tobruk. For this task the aircraft were painted with Luftwaffe markings.|$|E
