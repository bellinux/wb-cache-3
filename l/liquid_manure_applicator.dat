In a research project the University of Applied Sciences Zwickau and some other industry partners will develop such a new innovative <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> spreader. The new <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> spreader should use pulsating air to distribute the <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> exactly.

Furthermore it is important to ensure that the substitute fluid is, like <b>liquid</b> <b>manure,</b> a non-Newtonian fluid.
