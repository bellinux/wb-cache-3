5|$|In 2009, 1990 people {{applied for}} 432 {{places at the}} college. From 2010, {{admission}} is administrated through the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service. The college also has a three-year part-time master's degree in police science. As {{the chief of police}} and deputy chief of police are part of the prosecuting authority, they must be a candidate of law to act in such a position. Although there no <b>longer</b> <b>is</b> a formal requirement for such an education, the role as prosecutor effectively hinders others from holding the position.|$|E
5|$|The maximum {{terminal}} hair length {{depends on}} the length of the anagen (period of hair growth) for the individual. Waist-length hair or <b>longer</b> <b>is</b> only possible to reach for people with long anagen. The anagen lasts between 2 and 7 years, for some individuals even longer, and is followed by shorter catagen (transition) and telogen (resting) periods. At any given time, about 85% of hair strands are in anagen. The fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects the hair cycle in mammals including humans; blocking FGF5 in the human scalp (by applying a herbal extract that blocked FGF5) extends the hair cycle, resulting in less hair fall and increased hair growth.|$|E

25|$|In databases, it is {{possible}} for a field not to have a value. It is then said to have a null value. For numeric fields it is not the value zero.

In contrast, use of Berber is relatively common in Morocco, and also in Algeria, and in the remote central Sahara. Berber poetry endures, as well as a traditional Berber literature.|$|E

25|$|A beam {{projector}} is a lensless instrument {{with very}} little beam spread. It uses two reflectors. The primary reflector is a parabolic reflector and the secondary reflector is a spherical reflector. The parabolic reflector directs the light into nearly parallel beams, and the spherical reflector is {{placed in front of}} the lamp to reflect light from the lamp back to the parabolic reflector, which reduces spill. The result is an intense shaft of light that cannot be easily controlled or modified. The beam projector no <b>longer</b> <b>is</b> used {{to the extent that it}} once was, as newer fixtures and PAR lamps have created easier ways to produce the effect.|$|E
25|$|Street length {{influences}} proportionately {{the amount}} of street components {{that have to be}} constructed such as pavement, curbs and sidewalks, storm sewers and drains, light poles, and trees. The street length of a given area of development depends on the frequency at which streets occur which in turn depends on the length and width of a block. The higher the frequency of streets the <b>longer</b> <b>is</b> their total length. The smaller the block dimensions the higher the frequency of the streets. As the frequency of street increases so does the number of intersections. Intersections normally cost more than straight street length because they are labour-intensive and require street and traffic signage.|$|E

However, he could not save her life because doctors had prescribed costly drugs. Later on in 1963, on {{the day when he}} was dropped from the cabinet, he was sitting in his home in the dark, without a light. When asked about the reason, he said as he no <b>longer</b> <b>is</b> a minister, all expenses will have to be paid by himself and that as a MP and minister he didn't earn enough to save for time of need.|$|E

25|$|The {{head and}} body of Euoplocephalus {{were covered with}} bony armor, except for parts of the limbs and {{possibly}} the distal tail. The armor consisted of osteoderms, skin ossifications that {{are not part of}} the skeleton proper. This armor was in 1982 extensively described by Kenneth Carpenter, who however, largely based himself on the very complete specimen NHMUK R5161, the holotype of Scolosaurus, which genus no <b>longer</b> <b>is</b> seen as a synonym of Euoplocephalus. When limited to the certain material of the latter genus, little is known of the exact configuration of the armor, with the exception of the head and the neck. The most informative specimen in this respect would then be ROM 1930, having conserved some osteoderms of the torso in their original position.|$|E
25|$|Much of the municipality's {{economy is}} now {{tied to the}} influx of {{tourists}} and foreigners who come to live, mostly retirees. A Wikipedia sister site Wikivoyage has an entry for San Miguel de Allende. In 2002, 250,000 visitors spent about 8.4 million USD at the town's attractions, but those who live here contribute far more to the economy. Most of this is concentrated {{in the town of}} San Miguel proper. It accounts for over 36% of the municipality's jobs and most of the municipality's income. Tourism accounts for almost all of the municipality's income from outside. This began in the mid 20th century as a cheap place to live; however, despite recent economic downturns, it no <b>longer</b> <b>is.</b> This has not lessened San Miguel's attraction for foreign visitors and retirees as homes and hotels here are still significantly cheaper than in the U.S. or Europe. Despite not having a casino or an airport and being 400 miles from the nearest beach, this small city has been ranked by magazines such as Time and Leisure and Condé Nast Traveler as one of its preferred places to live and visit.|$|E
25|$|When {{the main}} {{electron}} gun writes an image to the screen, the {{energy in the}} main beam is sufficient to create a 'potential relief' on the storage mesh. The areas where this relief is created no longer repel the electrons from the flood gun which now pass through the mesh and illuminate the phosphor screen. Consequently, the image that was briefly traced out by the main gun continues to be displayed after it has occurred. The image can be 'erased' by resupplying the external voltage to the mesh restoring its constant potential. The time for which the image can be displayed was limited because, in practice, the flood gun slowly neutralises the charge on the storage mesh. One way of allowing the image to be retained for <b>longer</b> <b>is</b> temporarily {{to turn off the}} flood gun. It is then possible for the image to be retained for several days. The majority of storage tubes allow for a lower voltage to be applied to the storage mesh which slowly restores the initial charge state. By varying this voltage a variable persistence is obtained. Turning off the flood gun and the voltage supply to the storage mesh allows such a tube to operate as a conventional oscilloscope tube.|$|E
