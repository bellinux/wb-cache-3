5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But {{in the course of}} that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E
25|$|Why did {{the date}} of Benjamin Britten's death – 4 December 1976 – touch such a chord in me? During this time I was {{obviously}} {{at the point where}} I could recognise the magnitude of such a loss. Inexplicable feelings of guilt, more than that even, arose in me. I had just discovered Britten for myself. Just before his death I began to appreciate the unusual purity of his music – I had had the impression of the same kind of purity in the ballads of Guillaume de Machaut. And besides, for a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had wanted to meet Britten personally – and now it would not come to that.|$|E

The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E

25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> put down the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E

500|$|The imposed {{regimen of}} asylum life gave van Gogh a hard-won stability: [...] "I feel happier {{here with my}} work than I could be outside. By staying here a good <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> shall have learned regular habits {{and in the long}} run the result will be more order in my life." [...] While his time at Saint-Rémy forced him to manage his vices, such as coffee, alcohol, poor eating habits and {{periodic}} attempts to consume turpentine and paint, his stay was not ideal. [...] He needed to obtain permission to leave the asylum grounds. The food was poor; he generally ate only bread and soup. [...] His only apparent form of treatment were two-hour baths twice a week. During his year there, van Gogh had periodic attacks, possibly due to a form of epilepsy. By early 1890, when the attacks worsened, he concluded that his stay at the asylum was not helping him to recover, which led him to move to Auvers-sur-Oise just north of Paris in May 1890.|$|E

He moved several times during his youth, including a move to Colorado {{at the age of}} nine, when he was told that his father had died. According to Taylor, he was raised in Florida, where he was abused as a child and became involved in drugs by his teens. Taylor stated that he did not get along with his stepfather, a Vietnam veteran, or his mother: [...] "But she could never control me. My mother had a lot of animosity toward my father. They alienated me for a <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> was the whipping post." [...] At the age of 13, he stabbed his stepfather. According to court records, he repeatedly raped and sodomized his sister Laurie during his teens, and raped, and sodomized other young girls, and was committed to a sex offender program. In 1974, Taylor moved back to Ogden to live with his grandmother, but soon returned to Florida.|$|E

[...] Colfer stated that the opportunity to finally sing the song [...] "really meant the world" [...] to him, and that: [...] "It's absolutely terrifying to watch yourself do something you've dreamed about for such a <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> know I'm definitely not the best singer, but I think the message, the story behind the song about defying limits and borders placed by others, hopefully all that gets across with the performance.

Swanigan was the first Purdue basketball player to be drafted at the sophomore level or lower. During the 2017 NBA Summer League, Swanigan recorded 16.1 points, 10.6 rebounds, 2.25 assists and 1.4 steals per game in all eight games the Trail Blazers played in during the event, including the Summer League Championship game, where they ultimately lost to the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite that, Swanigan would earn All-Summer League First Team honors for leading the Trail Blazers into the Summer League Finals.|$|E

It also showed a neon-style aspect of the video, where Roberts wore Nike Air Max trainers, with neon moving sperm-shaped graffiti moving to the beat of the track. OK! magazine responded well whilst noting her unusually short dress in the video, they said [...] "we can't help but feel upbeat and summery when watching the star bounce about for single Lucky Day." [...] Aaron Spencer-Charles of Metro gave a mixed review, whilst describing the video, he ended with [...] "and that's it really.

[...] Popjustice commented on Nicola's seemingly lack of confidence in the video, stating Nicola, you light up our world like nobody else. But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell, you don't know you're beautiful.

500|$|The top six {{finishers}} in the Interzonal {{would qualify}} for the Candidates Tournament. Most observers doubted that a 15-year-old with no international experience could finish among the six qualifiers at the Interzonal, but Fischer told journalist Miro Radoicic, [...] "I can draw with the grandmasters, and there are half-a-dozen [...] in the tournament I reckon to beat." [...] Despite some {{bumps in the road}} and a problematic start, Fischer succeeded in his plan: after a strong finish, he ended up with 12/20 (+6−2=12) to tie for 5–6th. The Soviet grandmaster Yuri Averbakh observed, In the struggle at the board this youth, almost still a child, showed himself to be a full-fledged fighter, demonstrating amazing composure, precise calculation and devilish resourcefulness. I was especially struck not even by his extensive opening knowledge, but his striving everywhere to seek new paths. In Fischer's play an enormous talent was noticeable, and in addition one sensed an enormous amount of work on the study of chess. Soviet grandmaster David Bronstein said of Fischer's time in Portorož: [...] "It was interesting for me to observe Fischer, but for a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> couldn't understand why this 15-year-old boy played chess so well".

500|$|In February 2006, Stork {{became the}} last {{perpetrator}} sentenced {{in the political}} assassination plot, after ten months of negotiations with Oregon prosecutors. Stork offered to turn herself in {{and return to the}} United States after learning of her son's terminal brain tumor. Prior to sentencing, the court allowed her to travel to Australia to visit her son. In addition to charges of conspiracy to commit murder, Stork also pleaded guilty to the purchase of weapons in violation of federal firearms law. An Oregon judge sentenced her to five years probation, and three months time already served in a German jail. Turner thought she should have received a harsher sentence, and commented [...] "This was a lying-in-wait conspiracy to murder me, a presidential appointee, and for a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> slept with a loaded gun beside my bed." [...] Though Stork could have faced life in prison, U.S. District Judge Judge Malcolm F. Marsh thought she had [...] "seen the error of her ways." [...] A federal prosecutor in the case described Stork as the [...] "MVP" [...] of the conspiracy, and said she was the designated assassin that was set to murder Turner. After her sentencing, Stork stated: [...] "I actually conspired to kill Mr. Turner, it is up to me alone to face this terrible truth ... No person has the right to do what I did. I'm truly sorry."

500|$|The album's {{title track}} was said by band members {{to be the}} {{continuation}} of [...] "Final Six", which was an outtake from their previous album. [...] "Final Six" [...] origins deal with the apocalypse. [...] "Human Strain" [...] deals with apocalyptic origins as well. The track was explained by guitarist Jeff Hanneman to initially be about the human race dying off by a mutative disease. The title of [...] "Public Display of Dismemberment" [...] refers to the consequences that countries outside of the United States give to citizens for crimes. Tom Araya said that [...] "Unit 731" [...] is [...] "very similar to Josef Mengele {{in the sense that}} it was a medical unit in the military, which was a Japanese military unit, actually. They did kind of the same thing; they tested the limits of the human body and recorded it for scientific purposes." [...] "Playing With Dolls" [...] is about a child witnessing a serial killer. [...] "Beauty Through Order" [...] is about Elizabeth Báthory, the most prolific female serial killer. Jeff Hanneman explained: [...] "I've been meaning to write a song about that for a <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> couldn't figure out the angle, I was thinking, 'How does a woman write? I can't write like a woman I'm a guy!' Then I just figured, 'Well, she's evil; she has lots of power and killed people.' So I just started writing and the lyrics and they came out."

500|$|Immediately {{following}} the 1986 season, Weaver retired for good, and Ripken was named {{manager of the}} Orioles. The Orioles were coming off their first last-place finish in Baltimore, but Ripken expressed confidence in the team {{at the beginning of}} the 1987 season, saying, [...] "I know these guys can get the job done. I may be hardheaded, but that's what I believe. We'll be a competitive team." [...] The Orioles got off to a slow start in April 1987, going 9-12 while losing seven of nine games in ones stretch. However, the ballclub would improve in May, moving over [...]500 while setting a May record with 56 home runs. In June, the team fell out of contention, dropping to 28-36, their worst start since 1955. Pitching plagued the club; Harvey Rosenfeld wrote it was [...] "the root cause of the Orioles' problems. In 1987, Ripken became the first—and only—father to manage two sons simultaneously in the majors, as his son Billy was called up at the All-Star break. Ripken managed Cal Jr. and Billy for the first time on July 11, in a 21 loss to the Minnesota Twins. The Havre de Grace Record wrote, [...] "The Ripkens of Aberdeen became the first family of sports." [...] On September 14, during a 173 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays, Ripken substituted Cal Jr. with Ron Washington after the eighth inning, ending Cal Jr.'s major-league record streak of 8,243 consecutive innings played. Senior said after the game, [...] "I've been thinking about it for a <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> wanted to take the monkey off his back. It was my decision, not his."
