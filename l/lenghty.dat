The transaltion is accompanied by an analysis in which I mainly approach the problems related to translating philosophical terms as well rendering names and stylistic peculiarities of the author’s writing from English to Estonian. The introduction consists of some background information about Ayn Rand, her work and philosophy. In this part I have offered a potential genre definition for Atlas Shrugged and stated reasons why I chose to translate this specific piece. In the second part I present an overview of my translation strategy in which I address the goals set forth in the strategy. The section includes a detailed description of my approach to translating philosophical terms — a strategy encompassing my own subjective analysis of the terms and choosing the appropriate equivalent based on fixed equivalents obtained from dictionaries and various philosophical publications. I shall also provide a loose theoretical basis for my strategy designed to achieve a hybid of communicative and semantic translation. The third part offers a concise roundup of difficulties concerning translation of the language of philosophy and shows why translating philosophical terms can be a formidable task. This is also the <b>lenghtiest</b> part of the thesis, including a thorough translation-related analysis of nine philosophical terms that serve as key points of the philosophical speech in Atlas Shrugged as well as of reasons to why some specific terms were chosen over others in certain contexts. Example sentences from both languages are also included in the analysis of each term. The fourth and final analytical section of the thesis involves possible solutions for translating the title of the novel, comparing with each other the existing translations of the title in several languages such as Estonian, English, Russian, German, French and Spanish. I also argue why I chose domestication over foreignisation when names were concerned and how I chose to approach the problems of rendering some stylistic elements of the author’s writing — {{such as the use of}} italics and dashes — into Estonian. 58 The thesis has shed some light on the problems and solutions concerning translation of philosophical terms and on the process of translation when choosing equivalents. In the thesis, several philosophical terms were analysed and potential differences between seemingly identical terms in meaning were offered, hopefully providing a guidepost for future translators to consider...|$|R

In spite of this, the table is <b>lenghty</b> for high quality interpolators. This paper describes how the table size can be significantly lowered {{at a cost of}} slightly increased computation complexity and without quality loss.

However, considering that such models operate only above a lower magnetic field threshold, they do not provide an appropriate magnetic field regeneration process characterizing a self-sustainable dynamo. In this work we consider {{the existence of an}} additional &# 945;-effect to the Babcock-Leighton scenario in a mean-field axisymmetric kinematic numerical model. Both poloidal field regeneration mechanisms are treated with two different strength-limiting factors. Apart from the solar antisymmetric parity behavior, the main solar features are reproduced: cyclic polarity reversals, mid-latitudinal equatorward migration of strong toroidal field, poleward migration of polar surface radial fields, and the quadrature phase shift between both. Long-term variability of the solutions exhibits <b>lenghty</b> periods of minimum activity followed by posterior recovery, akin to the observed Maunder Minimum. Based on the analysis of the residual activity during periods of minimum activity, we suggest that these are caused by a predominance of the &# 945;-effect over the Babcock-Leighton mechanism in regenerating the poloidal field...|$|E

In order to answer that question three themes were investigated: the road into dependency, living as an addict and the road to recovery from dependency and the time that follows. The study followed a qualitative method and the theoretical approach was hermeneutic.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} diploma {{work is the}} {{evaluation}} of the logopaedist program for a student with speech and language disorder. The program was practising 18 months. We evaluated the program efficiency by measuring the student's progress in communication in the following areas: phonetic awareness, vocabulary and narrative. To evaluate the student's progress in communication we used non – standardized techniques of assessing the child's speech devolpment. To evaluate the phonetic awareness we used a non – standardized technique called A test of sound awareness where we evaluated each task numerically. To avluated the vocabulary we useda a non – standardized technique, namely, a description a picture and short test called A test of vocabulary. We evaluated the results by measuring {{the quantity and quality of}} the output. To evaluate the narrative we used a non – standardized technique: narrative with picture. We compared the results, obtained through the first and the second testing, thus identifying the student's progress in communication. In this way we determined the effectiveness of the logopaedist program.

40|$|Our {{objects of}} study are compactified moduli spaces of (1,p) -polarized abelian {{surfaces}} with level structure of canonical type. They are obtained from quotients of Siegel space S 2 {{by a certain}} paramodular group Γ 1,p. The construction of the compactification {{has been described by}} Hulek, Kahn and Weintraub in [HKW 2]. Our aim is to determine invariants of a desingularized model Ã 1,p. This could serve as a test case for similarly constructed moduli spaces. In particular we are interested in numerical invariants of Ã 1,p. To avoid combinatorial complications we will restrict our attention to p ≥ 5 and prime. The aim of this article is twofold. First we want to give a short account of the results obtained in [Z]. These include a geometric description of the canonical divisor of Ã 1,p as well as formulae for its self intersection number and the Euler number of the moduli space. We will give brief indications of proofs. Because computations in the toroidal compactification as in [HKW 2] soon become technical and <b>lenghty,</b> the full arguments cannot be repeated here.

40|$|The {{research}} and development of new or improved energy technologies is a time consuming process. In addition, long capital lock-up periods in the energy sector mean that new, innovative technologies only enter the market very slowly. As a consequence of this, market requirements can only be met after a <b>lenghty</b> delay. In order to reduce the uncertainties associated with these time lags, the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) commissioned the study "Energy Technologies 2050 - Priorities for Research and Development" in summer 2008. The study aims to identify new accents in already existing R&D topics and new R&D topics from the perspective of public funding. The study should make a substantial contribution to directing research policy and setting priorities for non-nuclear energy research in the coming years. It prepares the ground for the new energy research programme and was carried out by a consortium of scientific research institutes and industrial companies. The topics of energy efficiency in industry, commerce, trade, services and households, renewable energy sources, energy storage, fossil-based energy transformation, electrical grids, hydrogen, stationary fuel cells and the methanol economy are being given priority in the project.

The OCGC is a collaborative effort between multiple agencies in order to raise awareness about what data exist and to encourage cooperation for sharing and distributing available data. The clearinghouse is designed to enable easy access and usage for any person wanting or needing to obtain geospatial data or metadata for the Oregon coast. Metadata creation, and development and maintenance of the OCGC are discussed in this paper. One major objective of the project was to increase the visibility and utility of the clearinghouse by contacting potential participants and asking for their contributions of data and metadata. A second goal was to develop methods for assisting these agencies in contributing metadata, through the use of existing metadata-generating tools. Two metadata tools were explored and evaluated: a free, public-domain ArcView metadata collector extension developed by the NOAA Coastal Services Center and a commercial software application called the Spatial Metadata Management System (SMMS).

As these German versions were, after a <b>lenghty</b> translation process, administered {{for the first time to}} native speakers of German, (Jessner, Hofer, Pellegrini, & Pinto 2015), it was particularly significant to test their impact on German-speaking subjects. The pilot studies were conducted in three small centers of South Tyrol (North of Italy) on native speakers of German. Performances were measured by descriptive and inferential statistics indicators, and by comparison with the normative samples of the Italian TAM- 2 and TAM- 3. Results showed that both German pilot samples attained good metalinguistic performances at the implicit level, as measured by the L scores of each test, and in line with the Italian normative samples at the corresponding ages, and also at the explicit level, as measured by the ML scores of these tests, which were even superior to those of the Italian subjects. In either MKT- 2 and MKT- 3, Skewness and Kurtosis values were within range, reliability coefficients ranged from average to high, intercorrelations ranged from moderate to strong, and by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a major component was extracted, that represents the metalinguistic core of the test, as measured by the ML subtests.

40|$|A {{great number}} of {{structures}} are subjected to thermomechanical cyclic loading. For instance, {{it is the case}} of automotive engine: components such as cylinder heads or exhaust manifolds experience cyclic thermal loading. It is also the case of rails: in curve, gauge corners are subjected to high rolling contact stresses inducing cyclic plasticity or even ratchetting. The estimation of the lifetime of such structures under cyclic thermomechanical loading requires, on the one hand, the determination of the response until an asymptotic state is reached, and on the other hand, the use of an appropriate damage criterion. The computation of the whole loading history leads to <b>lenghty</b> and expensive incremental calculations, especially for structures with large number of degrees of freedom. Therefore, it is very useful to develop computational approaches for straightforward calculations of the possible stabilized state under repeated thermomechanical loading. Direct Cyclic Methods offer this alternative. The paper is devoted to Direct Cyclic Methods we propose. These numerical strategies, derived from the Large Time Increment Method are alternative to classical incremental methods or cycle jump techniques. Direct Cyclic Methods permit the direct determination of the asymptotic response of inelastic structures subjected to cyclic thermomechanical loadings. The different versions of the Direct Cyclic Method are presented. They differ from the solution of the global stage which is consuming the most CPU time. The first version of the Direct Cyclic Method uses a classical finite element method to compute the SA and KA response and has been used to studying cyclic response of structures subjected to small oscillatory contact displacements for fretting fatigue applications. The second version uses Fourier expansion in solving the global equations. It is this version which is in Abaqus Sofware. The third version adopts a decomposition in a wavelet basis and the SKA solutions are estimated using only the largest coefficients...|$|E

Nest height and leaf cover(one or many leaves, well or poorly covered) were very variable. Contrary to a previous report, egless jelly capsules we scattered amongst the eggs, with substancial jelly plugs located {{above and below the}} egg clutch. Plugs were composed of capsules embedded in a matrix of somewhat different composition. The upper plug acted as a barrier to water entry. Contrary to previous reports, isolated eggs could develop in aquatic media, the later stage on entry the better: Aeration and salt composition of the water influences this ability. Egg clutches developes equally well whether the covering leaves were alive or dead. Single eggs incubated in water hatched prematurely; when placed in water, eggs near hatching stage hatched within a short time; such eggs on a dry or damp substrate did not hatch till much later. The hatching of any embryo in a group appeared to act as a stimulus to neighbours to hatch. Observations ons nests with the covering leaves replaced by clingfilm showed that emergence is preceded by a <b>lenghty</b> period of hatching behavior, with individuals hatchins, wriggling and stimulating larger and larger groups to hatch, and releasing a frothy fluid wich leads to the dissolution of the lower jelly plug and emergence of the hatchlings. Contrary to a previous report, hatching gland cells were observable on the laterodorsal surface of the head. When hatchings emerged from the nest, they were mostly at Gosner stage 25 with gills fully resorbed. When earlier embryos were induced to hatch, they rapidly shortened their external gills.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{categorize}} the reasons for a prolonged or failed procedure in a series of patients undergoing catheter ablation of an accessory pathway. Background. Radiofrequency ablation of accessory pathways at times requires a lengthy procedure or a second ablation session, or both, and no prior studies have systematically investigated the reasons for this. Methods. In a consecutive series of 619 patients undergoing catheter ablation of an accessory pathway, the mean ablation time ±SD was 68 ± 64 min. The subjects of this study were 14 patients who had an ablation time > 2 SD greater than the mean (> 196 min) and 51 patients who required a second ablation session for a successful outcome. The accessory pathway in the 65 patients in this study was located in the right free wall in 19 patients (29 %), septum in 14 (22 %) and left free wall in 32 (49 %). Results. The primary reasons for a <b>lenghty</b> or failed ablation attempt were 1) inability to position the ablation catheter at the effective target site (16 patients, 25 %); 2) instability of the ablation catheter or inadequate tissue contact at the target site, or both (15 patients, 23 %); 3) mapping error due to an oblique course of the accessory pathway (7 patients, 11 %); 4) failure to recognize a posteroseptal accessory pathway as being left-sided instead of right-sided (4 patients, 6 %); 5) other errors in accessory pathway localization (6 patients, 9 %); 6) epicardial location of the accessory pathway (5 patients, 8 %); 7) recurrent atrial fibrillation (2 patients, 3 %); 8) occurrence of a complication (2 patients, 3 %); 9) unusual right-sided accessory pathway that inserted in the anterior right ventricle, 2 cm away from the lateral tricaspid annulus (1 patient, 1. 5 %); and 10) unexplained factors (7 patients, 11 %). The most common effective strategies employed to achieve a successful outcome in these patients were 1) substitution of a more experienced operator; 2) use of ablation catheters of varying configurations; 3) switching from a retrograde aortic to a transseptal approach; 4) switching from an inferior to a superior vena caval approach; 5) use of a 60 -cm guiding sheath; 6) detailed mapping of the atrial or ventricular insertion of the accessory pathway; and 7) searching within the coronary sinus for a presumed accessory pathway potential. Conclusions. A lengthy or failed attempt at catheter ablation of an accessory pathway may be due to a variety of reasons, the most common of which are problems related to some aspect of catheter manipulation and errors in accessory pathway localization. Knowledge of the most common reasons for a lengthy or ineffective procedure may facilitate successful outcome of accessory pathway ablation...|$|E

The {{main purpose}} of the thesis is to assess whether some kind of {{collective}} security arangement is relevant to the post- cold war security order in Europe. The vast body of recent literature making a case either for or against "collective security" (CS) in post-cold war Europe suggests {{that the concept of}} CS lends itself to different interpretations. By taking a state-centric and military oriented approach to security, chapter 2 presents the classical, universal notion of CS as a conceptual basis for analysis. As the unit of analysis is less than universial, chapter 3 introduces a typology of modified CS systembs. These "systems" are, nevertheless, consistent with the state-centric, "all for one and one for all" approach characterizing the ideal version. The modified versions are dubbed regional CS, concert-based CS, and hybrid CS. Regional CS is essentially a territorially delimited version of the universal model. It is argued that such a system has the potential of being exploited by regional hemons. Concert-based CS shares many of the features of the 19 th century Concert of Europe and is a system that is more consistent with power realities. A hybrid CS system has a dual character as it is a regional CS system as well as a collective self-defence organization. Chapter 4 discusses the main mechanisms of CS, and explores factors that influence their effectiveness when applied within a modifies CS setting. It is argued that the main mechamisms of CS are the deterrent effect of overwhelming military and non-military sanctions, as well as the compulsive effect of collective resistance to aggression. The <b>lenghty</b> discussion in chapter 5 reflects the notion that Europe is undergoing a process of dramatic change whose outcome is impossible to predict. Thus, this thesis has taken an approach towards the "issue of Europe" that opens for several outcomes, and evaluated the relevance of Collective Security to various pøausible post-cold war scenarios. Hence, chapter 5 pulls the strings together and discusses the relevance and feasibility of the CS systems and mechanisms within 5 different interpretations of the "European security complex": 1) Europe as the European Community (basically Western Europe); 2) Europe from Poland to Portugal (non-superpower Europe); 3) Atlanticist Europe (NATO Europe); 4) Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals (Gaullist Europe or Gorbachev's Common European House), and; 5) Europe from Vancouver to Vladivostock (CSCE Europe). The different interpretations are accompanied by judgements about plausible scenarios. Needless to say, the "pictures" of post-cold war Europe are painted with a very wide brush. However, relying on Neoliberal Institutionalist scenarios and propositions concering states' propensity to cooperate, it is argued that Collective Security is relevant with respect to three interpretations of the European security complex (2, 4 and 5). However, (Neo) Realist propositions pertaining to the effects of the uneven distribution of capabilities across states, suggest that CS may not be feasible unless the system respects power realities (as in the concert-based system), or allows for collective balancing against threats stemming from non-members (as in Hybrid CS). Chapter 6 provides concluding remarks. It is asserted that it seems to be common to think that the solution to Europe's quest for å post-cold war security order is a matter of finding the right balance between institutions like the EC, NATO, CSCE, WEU, NACC and so forth. However, as Robert Keohane has argued: "Institutions do not mandate what governments pursue their own interests through cooperation". Thus, the fact that former adversaries now convene in institutions like the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) may have a far greater value than realist scepticicm would suggest...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation was {{to contribute to the}} analysis of the telecomunicatons services industry in Portugal, both from a normative and positive perspective. In 1983 there were three operators, CTT, TLP and Marconi. Each of these had amonopoly, regionally or functionally defined: TLP supplied local telecomunications in Lisbon and Oporto {{in the rest of the}} country and lon-distance and international telephony and Marconi had a monopoly defined over submarine cable and satelite transmition means, which implied that it supplied intercontinental telecomunications as well as telecomunications with North-African countries, through the two other operators. Since 1970 CTT and TLP have been to the same Board of Administration, in spite of remaing two independent firms. In fact, when the government created TLP (at the end of the concession period of local communications in Lisbon and Oporto to APT), it simultaneously decide to merge CTT and TLP into a single operator. The main reason invoked in favor of this solution was the presumptive existence of a natural monopoly in the provision of telecommunications services. The first (and sole) step given in this direction was the submission of TLP to the Board of CTT. Due to several reasons, new restructurings were postponed and the status quo was maintained indefinitely. In the meanwhile, the development of new technologies, in particular radio-based transmition technologgies, had raised the question of the existence of natural monopolies on the provision of telecommunications services in other countries and in particular in the U. S. In simple terms, if ( [...] .) Hence, the discussion of the conditions thst characterize a natural seemed an empirically and theoretical relevant subject. In the late 70 s and early 80 s a vast body of theoretical and empirical literature on these questions emerged. These investigations showed that, in general, the existence of scale economies was neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a natural monopoly to prevail. Instead, this was characterized by a different condition on the technology, subbaditivity. However, this property cannot be empirically tested given the available econometric techniques and data. Investigation turned then to the determination of necessary and/or sufficient conditions of subbaditivity, amenable to empirical testing. Necessary conditions and sets of sufficient conditions were found although no necessary and sufficient conditions were met. At the begining ofthe 80 s some empirical studies on natural monopoly were conducted, for the US and Canadian telecommunications operators. These studies were largely motivated by the process which opposed the american State and AT&T, and which culminated with the dismantling of AT&T in 1983. Broaddly speaking these studies were inconclusive: necessary conditions were acepted but sufficient conditions were rejected in most of them. The {{objective of}} this dissertation was to contribute to clarify these questions, through the empirical estimation of the technology and the test of natural monopoly conditions on the supply of telecomunications by CTT. This work requires the use of large sets of data. As in most empirical work in economics the task of finding and working out these data was a very difficult and <b>lenghty</b> process. Once this process was completed, the underlying technology was estimated, the theoretical conditions on the validity of the empirical work were validated and the commonly used conditions of natural monopoly were tested,. As had happened in other studies, these rests were inconclusive. we decide then to test another set of sufficient conditions of additivity, known in the theiretical literature but which, for some reason, had not been empirically tested before. This attemopt led us to conclude that, in 1970, CTT enjoyed a natural monopoly on the production of telephony, telex and other telecommunications services. ( [...] .)
