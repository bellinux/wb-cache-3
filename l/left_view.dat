25|$|Proletarian internationalism saw {{itself as}} a {{deterrent}} against war, because people with a common interest {{are less likely to}} take up arms against one another, instead focusing on fighting the ruling class. According to Marxist theory, the antonym of proletarian internationalism is bourgeois nationalism. Some Marxists, together with others on the <b>left,</b> <b>view</b> nationalism, racism (including anti-Semitism) and religion as divide and conquer tactics used by the ruling classes to prevent the working class from uniting against them. Left-wing movements therefore have often taken up anti-imperialist positions. Anarchism has developed a critique of nationalism that focuses on nationalism's role in justifying and consolidating state power and domination. Through its unifying goal, nationalism strives for centralization, both in specific territories and in a ruling elite of individuals, while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism, this subject has been treated extensively by Rudolf Rocker in Nationalism and Culture and by the works of Fredy Perlman, such as Against His-Story, Against Leviathan and The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism.|$|E

50|$|Stereoscopic viewing is {{achieved}} at a matching {{distance to the}} glasses. When placing the right view {{on top of a}} (letter/A4 size) paper and the <b>left</b> <b>view</b> below, viewing from arm length distance (ca. 50 cm) creates a stereo experience. Bigger over/under stereo image pairs on either paper or a monitor can be viewed from a proportional greater distance. In general, the prisms achieve a 19° viewing angle.|$|E
50|$|Third-angle {{is as if}} {{the object}} were a box to be unfolded. If we unfold the box so that the front view is {{in the center of the}} two arms, then the top view is above it, the bottom view is below it, the <b>left</b> <b>view</b> is to the left, and the right view is to the right. It is {{standard}} in the USA (ASME Y14.3-2003 specifies it as the default projection system), Japan (JIS B 0001:2010 specifies it as the default projection system), Canada, and Australia.|$|E

50|$|After {{the coup}} the group aimed to {{consolidate}} its cadres and its theoritical base. However in 1982 a division has occurred {{within the group}} between Yalçın Küçük supporters and Metin Çulhaoğlu followers. Yalçın Küçük and his group published Toplumsal Kurtuluş while Metin Çulhaoğlu and his group published Gelenek magazine after his release from jail in 1986. TKP stems from Gelenek magazine organisation. Gelenek defined the left in three categories as; orthodox, revolutionary democratic and new. From this perspective it defended the orthodox <b>left</b> <b>view</b> and critisized the the ongoing glasnost & perestroika processes in the Soviet Union.|$|E
5000|$|In third-angle projection, the {{parallel}} projectors originate as if radiated {{from the far}} side of the object and pass through the 3D object to project a 2D image onto the orthogonal plane in front of it. The views of the 3D object are like the panels of a box that envelopes the object, and the panels pivot as they open up flat into the plane of the drawing. Thus the <b>left</b> <b>view</b> is placed on the left and the top view on the top; and the features closest to the front of the 3D object will appear closest to the front view in the drawing. Third-angle projection is primarily used in the United States and Canada, where it is the default projection system according to ASME standard ASME Y14.3M.|$|E
