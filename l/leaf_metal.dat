Lipid hydroperoxides increased proportionally with increasing leaf Zn concentration after 2 and 8 weeks, while no changes in total glutathione were observed.

Results from the field revealed that increasing <b>leaf</b> <b>metal</b> concentration (Zn, Cu or Pb) produced a proportional increase in GPx activity whereas lipid hydroperoxides and total glutathione were not affected.

Metal hyperaccumulator species attract interest as they represent an extreme end of natural variation of the metal homeostasis network. This might be useful to reveal the global functioning of metal homeostasis networks and uncover key nodes whose alterations can drastically modify metal accumulation and tolerance. In addition, metal hyperaccumulation is a compelling model to study adaptation. In the last few years, major progress has been achieved {{in our understanding of}} the mechanisms underlying metal hyperaccumulation in A. halleri. High rates of metal uptake by roots, root-to-shoot translocation and efficient shoot vacuolar sequestration play central roles in determining hyperaccumulation and hypertolerance. Enhanced functions of several metal transporter-encoding genes result from gene copy number amplification and/or (cis) -regulatory changes. We will describe the function of several transporters in zinc and cadmium hyperaccumulation and hypertolerance, and in the adjustment of nutrient homeostasis in A. halleri. Recent work aiming to determine if selection acted during the evolutionary history of A. halleri on a loci required for metal tolerance and accumulation will be presented...|$|E

Metal homeostasis genes are overrepresented in the systemic transcriptional response of roots to the wounding of leaves in A. halleri, supporting that leaf Cd accumulation is preceded by systemic signaling events. A similar, but quantitatively less pronounced transcriptional response was observed in A. thaliana, suggesting that the systemically regulated modulation of metal homeostasis in response to leaf wounding also occurs in non-hyperaccumulator plants.

Compared to control loci flanking the three tandem HMA 4 gene copies, a gradual depletion of nucleotide sequence diversity and an excess of low-frequency polymorphisms are hallmarks of positive selection in HMA 4 promoter regions, culminating at HMA 4 - 3. The accompanying hard selective sweep is segmentally eclipsed as a consequence of recurrent ectopic gene conversion among HMA 4 protein-coding sequences, resulting in their concerted evolution.

In beech leaves we observed intensive leaching of Ni, whereas downward trends in the Cu concentration of beech leaves, as well as Mn and Zn in beech and oak leaves, were related to weight loss of the leaves.

Metal concentrations in Z capricorni leaves and rhizomes were analyzed for correlations with porewater and sediment concentrations from 7 locations within Lake Illawarra, a 35 km 2 lagoon located south of Wollongong, NSW (Australia). Concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, M n, Pb, and Z n in seagrass tissues collected near to an industrial complex including a steelworks and copper smelter, and adjacent to a former power station, {{were significantly higher than}} concentrations in seagrass collected from the lake entrance. Variations in metal concentrations were also observed between seagrass leaves and rhizomes. The majority of metals was accumulated to higher concentrations in leaves than in rhizomes. Arsenic concentrations were highest in rhizomes. Lead and nickel were not accumulated to high concentrations in most tissue samples from Lake Illawarra, although differences in ambient lead concentrations were reflected in some groups of leaf samples. Manganese concentrations in both leaves and rhizomes exhibited significant correlations with manganese concentrations in Lake Illawarra porewaters. Other metals were below detection limits (ICP-MS) in porewaters. The concentrations of arsenic, copper, nickel, lead and zinc in seagrass tissues exhibited negative or positive correlations with the percentage of silt and clay in sediments, but spatial variations of metals in Z capricorni were more influenced by proximity to industrial sources than by sediment grainsize. Multi-dimensional scaling of all seagrass <b>leaf</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations indicated that seasonal factors may exert a greater influence on the relative uptake of metals by seagrass than do localized factors such as metal sources and sediment grain size.

Urtica dioica grown in hydroponic solutions containing from less than 0. 003 to 5. 7 mg Cd/L or from 0. 02 to 41. 9 mg Zn/L accumulated metals resulting in leaf tissue concentrations {{in the range of}} 0. 10 to 24. 9 mg Cd/kg or 22. 5 to 2, 772. 0 mg Zn/kg. No toxicological effects were apparent except at the highest concentrations tested, suggesting that this species may be an important pathway for transfer of metals to primary plant consumers. Helix aspersa and Lumbricus terrestris were fed the Cd- and Zn-rich leaves of U. dioica for six and four weeks, respectively. Cadmium and Zn body load increased with increasing metal concentration in the leaves (p < 0. 001). Ratios of invertebrate metal concentration to <b>leaf</b> <b>metal</b> concentration were in the range of 1 : 0. 03 to 1 : 1. 4 for Cd and 1 : 0. 2 to 1 : 2. 8 for Zn in H. aspersa and 1 : 0. 002 to 1 : 3. 9 for Cd and 1 : 0. 2 to 1 : 8. 8 for Zn in L. terrestris. Helix aspersa Cd and Zn tissue concentrations (15. 5 and 1, 220. 2 mg/kg, respectively) were approximately threefold those in L. terrestris when both species were fed nettle leaves with concentrations of approximately 23 mg Cd/ kg and 3, 400 mg Zn/kg. Models demonstrate that L. terrestris Cd tissue concentrations (r(2) = 0. 74, p < 0. 001) and H. aspersa Zn tissue concentrations (r(2) = 0. 69, p < 0. 001) can be estimated from concentrations of Cd and Zn within the leaves of U. dioica and suggest that reasonably reproducible results can be obtained using these species for ecotoxicological testing...|$|E

Two levels of each, lead (300 ppm, 600 ppm) and cadmium (3 ppm, 6 ppm) were used to contaminate the soil. The results of analysis of variance for lead and cadmium tolerance revealed significant genotypic differences at P < 0. 01 for leaf, root, shoot and fruit metal contents along-with yield per plant. Significant differences were found for all the traits studied under all levels of lead and cadmium stress. On the basis of fruit metal contents and high yield, thirteen genotypes, eight tolerant (9086, Roma, Sitara TS- 01, Pak 0010990, Picdeneato, CLN- 2123 A, 006231, 7035) and five non tolerant (42 - 07, 17883, BL- 1176 -Riostone- 1 - 1, 17882) were selected. The selected genotypes were crossed in line × tester mating design to assess GCA, SCA and heterotic effects in breeding material. The genotype × metal interaction was found significant for metal contents (leaf, root, shoot, and fruit) and yield per plant indicating that all genotypes responded differently to increasing levels of lead and cadmium. Analysis of variance for F 1 showed highly significant differences among all the genotypes including parents and hybrids for different morpho-physiological and quality traits i. e. days to first picking (DFP), number of clusters per plant (NC/P), number of flowers per cluster (NFL/C), number of fruits per cluster (NF/C), fruit setting percentage (FS%),plant height (PH), fruit yield per plant (Y/Pl), <b>leaf</b> <b>metal</b> contents, root metal contents, shoot metal contents, fruit metal contents, total soluble solids (TSS), ascorbic acid contents (AaC) and lycopene contents (LC). The mean squares or differences among treatments were found significant for all the traits under control and two levels of each lead and cadmium. Under control conditions, variances due to treatments, parents, crosses, testers, parents vs. crosses and line vs. tester were found significant for all the traits under study. On the basis of GCA results the line Picdeneato and tester 17882 were found best general combiners while SCA results indicated that cross combinations Roma × 17883 and Picdeneato × Marmande were found good specific combiners. Variances due to SCA were found more than the variances due to GCA indicating that non additive type of gene action is controlling all the traits in all environments (lead, cadmium & control). Heterosis results indicated that cross combinations Sitara TS- 01 × 17882, 7035 × 17882 and Roma × 17882 performed well for most of the traits under study in terms of significant heterosis. Cross combinations 006231 × 42 - 07 and Roma × 17883 performed well under all metal stress conditions.
