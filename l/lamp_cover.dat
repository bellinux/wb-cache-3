50|$|About {{a century}} ago, the bambooworking was only {{limited to the}} making of living {{materials}} and productive tools such as hats, buckets, food steamers, dustpans, tables and chairs, beds, ridges and so on; when Taiwan was invaded by the Japanese {{at the end of}} the 19th century, the bamboo weaving skills were widely extended from the living and production use to the field of stationery, decoration, and even arts. In the meanwhile, the rough weaving skills were refined to be more delicate. The stationery case and <b>lamp</b> <b>cover,</b> which was woven by the Japanese artist at the Guangxu Times in Qing dynasty in China, was first discovered by Wang Zhenduo. Both these two bamboo products are beautiful in color, discreet in skills, and fashionable in pattern, which makes it too attractive to be released from one’s hands. The stationery case is 30 centimeters in length, 18 centimeters in width, and 8 centimeters in height. Woven by a number of bamboo strips of 0.5 cm in width, the stationery case has such average gaps between every two strips that it seems as if it were produced by the assembly line in the factory rather than made by human hands. Besides, the purplish red bamboo strips, where letter paper and thread-bound books were placed, appear quite simple and historically meaningful. As for the <b>lamp</b> <b>cover,</b> it is 23 centimeters in length, and 5 centimeters in width. Seeing the brown bamboo filament on the lamp and the paper-cut window decoration, one must be reminiscent of a simply-dressed and elegant host of the room.|$|E

50|$|The 'new' S-class {{generation}} development {{began in}} 1966, {{which was only}} {{a year after the}} launch of the W108/09. This was the first Mercedes saloon to feature the brand new corporate styling theme which was to be continued until 1993 when the 190 was discontinued. The design, finalized in December 1969 was a dramatic leap forward, with more masculine lines that combined to create an elegant and sporty character. The basic design concept carried through the themes originally introduced on the R107 SL-Class roadster, especially the front and rear lights. As for the SL, the W116 received the ridged <b>lamp</b> <b>covers</b> which kept dirt accumulation at bay; this was to remain a Mercedes-Benz design theme into the 21st century.

The R:FR ratios, measured with a Skye SKR 100 /SKR 110 radiometer pointed to the light sources (Skye Instruments), were 0. 24 and 0. 68 for +FR and-FR treatments, respectively (Izaguirre et al., 2006). The drop in R:FR caused by FR supplementation was equivalent {{to the effect of}} neighbor proximity in a canopy of leaf-area index = 0. 5.

40|$|We present {{measurement}} results demonstrating that a conducting lead sphere exposed to electromagnetic (e/m) {{waves in the}} infrared (IR) regime, is attracted by e/m waves. The result may seem surprising and against conventional wisdom that electromagnetic wave forcing should lead to a repulsive force. Nonetheless, all our experiments show that the attractive force can be determined quantitatively, {{and that they are}} reproducible. Our experiment setup is a Cavendish torsion-balance experiment with lead spheres, one of the spheres intermittently irradiated by IR light. Because the Cavendish experiment is well known, simple, and readily available, the results can be easily verified or falsified. However, to avoid Bernoulli and other external forcing effects, the entire experimental setup should be placed in a vacuum chamber. In our case the experiments were performed at ≈ 4 · 10 ^- 7 mbar. One of the 20 g lead spheres was intermittently irradiated by infrared radiation from a <b>lamp</b> <b>covered</b> by an aluminium foil. Two independent experiments (V 1 and V 2) are described. Besides showing that wave energy and momentum transfer leads to attraction, we also describe some experimental requirements and constraints. The lamp was powered on during 10 or 12 s, the power changing between 8, 16, and 26 W. All measurements, including those affected by lamp out-gassing, shows that the attracting force on the lead sphere increases with increasing irradiative energy. From the V 2 experiment, preceded by lamp "baking" to eliminate repulsive out-gassing forces, the irradiative energy 8. 7 Ws on the sphere resulted in a total force 2. 9 +/- 0. 5 · 10 ^- 9 (N). From the V 2 experiment we also derive a power law relation between incident radiation energy (W) and the attractive force, corresponding to F= 2. 8 · 10 ^- 10 W^ 1. 1, with R^ 2 = 0. 95.

30|$|As {{aforementioned}} in Section 3, {{the bright}} channel prior works by {{assuming that the}} atmospheric light is of a neutral color and tries to factor this neutral color out by measuring it from the bright channel. Because there {{will be at least}} one pixel, ensure a minimum value in at least one channel in most low illumination patches; this intuitively works. However, when there is a patch entirely containing a bright object, such as lamp light, the estimation will fail. As shown in Fig.  5, the lamp light introduces significant bias in the final result. For regions depicting <b>lamp</b> light <b>cover,</b> the contrast between predominantly saturated dark background and high intensity lamp light introduces artificial transmission variations. Conversely, image regions containing dark objects will tend to yield artificially low values in the bright channel, causing inconsistent transmission orderings that are driven by object/region texture instead of scene nighttime properties.|$|R

Features that differ from those previously mentioned on the Tahoe Limited included the Z71 off-road chassis package (46 mm Bilstein shock absorbers, a standard 3.73 rear gear ratio G80 locking differential), body colored wheel flares, trim, grille and bumpers, inset driving lights built into the center of the front bumper, oversized two row radiator, two tone leather seating surfaces in either a gray or neutral theme, distinctive tail <b>lamp</b> lens <b>covers,</b> black tubular side assist step bars, black brush guard, and distinctive 16 inch Alcoa five spoke 6 bolt polished aluminum wheels.|$|R
50|$|Secondly, {{although}} the carbon arc lamp was bright, and relatively economical for the illumination produced, individual lamps were expensive and complicated, although powerful. This encouraged their use as the {{minimum number of}} large <b>lamps</b> to <b>cover</b> an entire work site.

There was a sudden contrast between the illuminated and shadow areas, especially where a point was only in sight of a single lamp.

The Wells light was specifically contrasted with the point-source of the arc lamp and the relatively shadow-free illumination was cited as an advantage in their adverts.

She told Gilbert Osmond that she had done so, and he replied that, spending many of his summers as well as his winters in Italy, he himself would loiter a little longer in the cool shadow of Saint Peter's. He would not return to Florence for ten days more, and in that time she would have started for Bellaggio. It might be months in this case before he should see her again. This exchange took place in the large decorated sitting-room occupied by our friends at the hotel; {{it was late in the}} evening, and Ralph Touchett was to take his cousin back to Florence on the morrow. Osmond had found the girl alone; Miss Stackpole had contracted a friendship with a delightful American family on the fourth floor and had mounted the interminable staircase to pay them a visit. Henrietta contracted friendships, in travelling, with great freedom, and had formed in railway-carriages several that were among her most valued ties. Ralph was making arrangements for the morrow's journey, and Isabel sat alone in a wilderness of yellow upholstery. The chairs and sofas were orange; the walls and windows were draped in purple and gilt. The mirrors, the pictures had great flamboyant frames; the ceiling was deeply vaulted and painted over with naked muses and cherubs. For Osmond the place was ugly to distress; the false colours, the sham splendour were like vulgar, bragging, lying talk.

Domestic energy poverty is most severe in the rural areas of South Asia, South East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

This situation hampers economic growth and social development and implies severe stress on resources and the environment.
