50|$|Lyctus brunneus is {{a species}} of beetle in the family Bostrichidae. It {{is a member of}} the {{subfamily}} Lyctinae, the powderpost beetles. It is known commonly as the brown powderpost beetle or brown <b>lyctus</b> <b>beetle.</b> Today it is distributed worldwide but it was probably originally native to the Neotropical region. Like other powderpost beetles, this species lives in wood.|$|E
50|$|The Forestry Conference {{had been}} held in 1923. An Empire Forestry Conference {{had been held}} earlier in 1920. There was an Empire Forestry Association. The Forest Products Research Laboratories were set up {{initially}} at the RAE in north-east Hampshire in 1925. In 1927, a new site was built at Princes Risborough. The site cost £80,000, and was officially opened on 31 July 1928. The first Director was Sir Ralph Pearson, who stayed until 1933. The site was conducting research into the <b>Lyctus</b> (<b>beetle),</b> a pest, and dry rot, caused by fungi.|$|E
50|$|Lyctus planicollis is a wood-boring beetle in {{the family}} Bostrichidae (formerly {{in the family}} Lyctidae, which is now a {{subfamily}} of Bostrichidae), {{commonly known as the}} southern <b>lyctus</b> <b>beetle</b> or lyctid powderpost beetle. It is a serious pest of hardwoods including ash, hickory, oak, maple and mahogany and can infest many products in the home including hardwood flooring and structural timbers, plywood, furniture, tool handles, picture frames, baskets and ladders. Timber can be infested in one location and then be transported large distances by ship, after which the beetles can emerge and spread the infestation to new areas.|$|E

30|$|One major {{disadvantage}} of applying X-ray CT to monitor insect activity {{is that the}} obtained data are momentary and discontinuous. In our experiment, the scan intervals were mostly 3  days, and uncertainty remained regarding the activity of larvae between the scans. Therefore, a different approach with higher temporal resolution {{that could be used}} in a continuous, long-term measurement would be desirable. When wood-attacking insects, such as termites [12] and <b>lyctus</b> <b>beetles</b> [13], bite off a wood fragment, elastic waves called acoustic emission (AE) are produced. Because AE is directly related to the feeding activity of insects, AE monitoring may meet these requirements and is expected to be a valuable approach for future analysis.|$|R
50|$|The {{ambrosia beetle}} (Platypus spp. and Xyleborus spp.) and powderpost <b>beetles</b> (<b>Lyctus</b> spp. and Xylobiops basilaris) often cause {{economic}} damage to logs and lumber during storage and air-drying.|$|R
50|$|Severe {{damage to}} hickory lumber and {{manufactured}} hickory products {{is caused by}} powderpost <b>beetles</b> (<b>Lyctus</b> spp. and Polycanon stoutii). Gall insects (Caryomyia spp.) commonly infest leaves. The fruit-tree leafroller (Archips argyrospila) and the hickory leafroller (Argyrotaenia juglandana) {{are the most common}} leaf feeders. The giant bark aphid (Longistigma caryae) is common on hickory bark. This aphid usually feeds on twigs and can cause branch mortality. The European fruit lecanium (Parthnolecanium corni) is common on hickories.|$|R
40|$|<b>Lyctus</b> powder-post <b>beetles</b> are a {{group of}} wood-boring insects which J- attack the sapwood only of certain {{recently}} seasoned hardwoods and have for many years past been causing considerable losses to the hardwood-using industries in Great Britain and other countries. The life-history, habits, and economic importance of these insects, together with recommendations for the prevention and control of their attack, have been described in this country by Altson (i) and Munro (4) and, more recently, {{as a result of}} investigations at the Forest Products Research Laboratory, by Fisher (2, 3) and Parkin (5). Very few hardwood timber firms take active steps to prevent Lyctus damage, but the majority are, at some time, compelled to consider methods of control: sterilization of infected timber in a steam-operated kiln {{is one of the most}} satisfactory. Reference to previous research on kiln-sterilization in relation to Lyctus control reveals that three papers only are of special interest. Snyder (6), in some preliminary experiments, showed that a temperature of 1800 F. in a dr...|$|R
30|$|Historically insect {{damage to}} wooden {{buildings}} has been common in Japan, with termite damage most apparent. However, {{over the last}} 100  years {{a wider range of}} attack has become apparent and recently at Nikkō problems have been especially pronounced. From the late 19 th century advice was available to limit insect attack, but the extensive use of bamboo made protection of this material a focus of studies [21] in the Meiji era (1868 – 1912). There were investigations (1900 – 1907) of the larval attack (possibly by Omphisa fuscidentalis) and damage by the powderpost <b>beetle</b> (<b>Lyctus</b> spp.), which caused damage to bamboo furniture [22].|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of decompression treatment as a non-destructive method to control larvae of the powderpost <b>beetle,</b> <b>Lyctus</b> africanus Lesne, was evaluated {{in the laboratory}} using various combinations of two pressure levels, 1. 1 kPa and 40 kPa, and three temperature levels, 20, 25, and 40 °C. Larval mortality generally depended on weight reduction while decreases in the oxygen level had relatively little effect. The lower pressure, 1. 1 kPa, significantly affected mortality, and no larvae survived after 12 h of this pressure treatment, at 25 °C. The average body weight was reduced with treatment time and temperature, and the reduction rate at 25 °C was higher than that at the lower temperature, 20 °C. Effects on larvae of the higher pressure treatment, 40 kPa, with a CO 2 gas purge, were tested to determine the feasibility of decompression treatment in the manufacturing process. Although higher pressure resulted in low mortality, the body weight was dramatically decreased using the CO 2 purge. These results present important information {{on the possibility of}} using decompression treatment for wood products...|$|R
3000|$|AE is the {{phenomenon}} in which small elastic {{waves in the}} ultrasonic frequency range are generated by {{the release of the}} stored strain energy when microfractures occur in a material. AE also refers to the elastic waves released by this phenomenon. Fujii et al. [5] reported that AE waves were detected from wood specimens attacked by termites, and Matsuoka et al. [6] directly confirmed that AE events were generated by the feeding activity of termites. Such studies {{led to the development of}} AE monitoring as a non-destructive testing technique to detect termite attack in wood and wooden structures [7]. Imamura and Fujii [8] also applied AE monitoring to the investigation of the feeding responses of termites using AE event rate as an index of feeding activity. Some studies, though significantly smaller in number than those on termites, deal with AE generated by wood-boring beetles, such as the powder-post <b>beetle</b> <b>Lyctus</b> brunneus [9, 10], the longhorn beetle species Semanotus japonicus [9, 11] and Hylotrupes bajulus [12], and the anobiid beetle species Anobium punctatum, Xestobium rufovillosum [12], and Oligomerus ptilinoides [13]. These previous reports suggested that the feeding activity of D. m [...]...|$|R
30|$|Figure  6 {{shows the}} {{progression}} of instars of all ten larvae, {{as well as the}} durations of instars, inactivity due to ecdysis, and prepupal and pupal stages. Five larvae underwent seven instars (“ 7 -instar type”) and the other five underwent eight instars (“ 8 -instar type”), suggesting that the number of instars can vary in this species. Although other numbers of instars were not found in this study because of the limitation of the number of AE measurement channels, it is possible that other instar types were present, with low abundance ratios. In related species, for example, variation in the number of larval instars was reported for the brown powderpost <b>beetle</b> <b>Lyctus</b> brunneus (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) [17] and the tobacco beetle Lasioderma serricorne (Coleoptera: Anobiidae) [18]. The larval duration of 8 -instar larvae was significantly longer than that of 7 -instar larvae (Student’s t test, p[*]<[*] 0.01). The adult body length was not significantly different between the instar types (Student’s t test, p[*]>[*] 0.05), although the sample sizes may be too small to discuss differences among instar types. Sexual differences {{may be one of the}} factors causing the difference in the total number of instars. However, the sexes of the employed individuals were not identified in this experiment, limiting further discussion; the clarification of sexual differences in larval development is a subject for future analysis.|$|R
40|$|Changes in ecology, {{climate and}} human {{behaviour}} over recent decades have favoured {{the development and}} increased prevalence of urban pests, including nuisance insects. The potential for nuisance insect species to increase in prevalence in the UK {{as a result of}} climate change is addressed in this report through two key objectives: 1 : To complete a desk top study to determine the current level of knowledge in relation to new and existing species of insect with the potential to cause statutory nuisance in the UK as a result of current and predicted climate change 2 : To investigate the potential for new and existing species of insect to cause statutory nuisance to occur in the UK as a result of current and predicted climate change In the first section of this report we consider the first objective and present an inventory of nuisance insects and discuss the availability of information on these species to Environmental Health Officers (EHOs). We conclude from this section that defining an insect as a statutory nuisance should be on a case-by-case basis; an insect will be a statutory nuisance in some scenarios but not others (particularly in relation to the source and abundance of the insects). In addition, we focus on two subsidiary objectives: 3. To devise a programme or technique for monitoring trends in the insects of most concern 4 To devise a list of strategies that Environmental Health Officers can apply locally and disseminate to residents. We comment on the wealth of literature and information on nuisance insect species but note the lack of a central information source for EHOs and other interested parties. We suggest that a central repository would be a valuable tool for EHO‟s particularly if it included fact sheets (providing relevant biological information for EHO‟s) and distribution maps. We advocate the use of the National Biodiversity Network (NBN) Gateway as a resource for providing distribution data but discuss the current limitations in terms of available data. We have appended example fact sheets for a number of species. In the second section of this report we consider nuisance insects more broadly than encompassed in the statutory nuisance definition, and provide examples of species that have 6 already been recorded in Britain (native and non-native including residents and occasional immigrants) or are potential invaders (non-native new arrivals). The methods used to review the literature on nuisance insects species and the impacts of climate change on their distribution, in a systematic way, are described. We highlight the nuisance insect species that are unlikely to be affected by climate warming Blattella germanica (german cockroach), Cimex lectularius (bed bug), Monomorium pharaonis (Pharaoh‟s ant), Anobium punctatum (woodworm), Ctenocephalides felis (cat fleas), <b>Lyctus</b> brunneus (powderpost <b>beetle),</b> Hylotrupes bajulus (house longhorn), Tineola bisselliella (common clothes moth), Dolichovespula media (media wasp) and Vespa crabro (European hornet). The ten species most likely to increase with climate warming are Tinearia alternata (moth fly), Lasius neglectus (invasive garden ant), Thaumetopoea processionea (oak processionary moth), Linepithema humile (Argentine ant), Reticulitermes grassei (Mediterranean termite), Culex pipiens molestus (urban mosquito), Culex pipiens pipiens (mosquito), Aedes vexans (mosquito – wetland), Ochlerotatus cantans (mosquito – woodland) and Musca domestica (house fly). The ten species most likely to increase with changes in precipitation are the same as for increasing temperature with the exception of Musca domestica and inclusion of Phlebotomus mascittii (sand fly). We provide two detailed case studies illustrating potential modelling approaches: biting midges and mosquitoes. In addition, we highlight the potential for further studies which would enable detailed quantitative analysis, such as demonstrated in the case studies, to be undertaken across taxa...|$|R
