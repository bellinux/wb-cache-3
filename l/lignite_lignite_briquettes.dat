40|$|<b>Lignite</b> and <b>lignite</b> humic acids, {{which are}} used as soil {{amendments}} sometimes, are supposed to improve soil properties such as water holding capacity. The structure of those materials is composed of various organic molecules stabilized mostly byweak interactions.

This accelerates the desiccation and hampers their application as natural hydrogel-like substances. In order to stabilize the structure of <b>lignite</b> humic acids and improve the water holding capacity, we applied formaldehyde cross-linking procedure based on covalent coupling of aromatic humic acids moieties. By combining the 1 H NMR relaxometry and methods of thermal analysis, the kinetics and degree of hydration, water distribution and moisture uptake were investigated. It was found that cross-linking induced a reduction in moisture sorption capacity at lowrelative humidity and an increase at higher relative humidity,which was attributed to the separation of functional groups and decreasing of structural compactness after crosslinking. As a result, the cross-linked humic acids, exhibited faster water uptake and approximately three-fold higher water holding capacity in comparison with the parental sample. The distribution of relaxation times of water protons in swollen humic acids revealed the unification of pore size distribution upon cross-linking.
