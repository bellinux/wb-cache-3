25|$|After the two {{passengers}} {{were placed in}} the patrol car, five white Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers – Stacey Koon, Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind, Theodore Briseno, and Rolando Solano – attempted to subdue King, who came out of the car last. King was tasered, struck with side-handled batons, then tackled to the ground and handcuffed. Sgt. Koon later testified at trial that King resisted arrest, and that he believed King was under the influence of PCP {{at the time of the}} arrest, which caused him to be very aggressive and violent toward the officers. Video footage of the arrest showed that he was attempting to get up each time he was struck, and that the police made no attempt to cuff him until he <b>lay</b> <b>still.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Crandon's [...] "teleplasmic hand" [...] that {{allegedly}} appeared in photographs {{was said to}} resemble animal tissue and trachea, cut and sewn together. Allegations were made by some conjuring historians of Houdini and mediumship that her surgeon husband had altered her genitalia and this was where she concealed her teleplasmic hand. The [...] "hand" [...] did not move after its appearance {{on the table before}} her. It <b>lay</b> <b>still</b> as if it were dead and then supposedly vanished. She refused to wear tights, or to be internally searched, but no proof that Crandon had been surgically altered has ever been published. The [...] "hand" [...] appeared only when Crandon sat next to her husband, who held or controlled her right hand.|$|E
2500|$|The company {{emerged from}} the forest at noon. A page who was drowsy from the sun dropped the king's lance, which clanged loudly against a steel helmet carried by another page. Charles shuddered, drew his sword and yelled [...] "Forward against the traitors! They wish to deliver me to the enemy!" [...] The king spurred his horse and began {{swinging}} his sword at his companions, fighting until one of his chamberlains {{and a group of}} soldiers were able to grab him from his mount and lay him on the ground. He <b>lay</b> <b>still</b> and did not react, but fell into a coma. The king had killed a knight known as [...] "The Bastard of Polignac" [...] and several other men.|$|E

6000|$|Rhoda <b>still</b> <b>lay</b> quite <b>still,</b> and Peter, {{holding on}} with difficulty, for the coach quite rocked {{with the speed}} at which they were going, climbed over to her, and stooped, down. [...] "Shall I help you up, Rhoda?" ...|$|R

2500|$|The Battle of Seven Pines {{began on}} May 31, 1862. [...] Pickett's brigade was not involved, even though much of Longstreet's Division was engaged. [...] At 8:00 AM on June 1, the 19th Virginia formed up and {{prepared}} for action. The regiment stacked its arms and waited for orders, when a volley fired their direction sent them scurrying back into formation. Pickett's Brigade advanced toward {{the direction of the}} shots. The 19th was halted and ordered to lie down and maintain silence when a large body of Federal infantry was found completely behind them, while another body of Federals advanced directly to their front. Assuming themselves surrounded, the 19th <b>lay</b> <b>still</b> and waited until the Federals to their front were nearly on top of them before they stood and delivered a volley that stopped the Federals cold. In less than [...] "eight minutes," [...] as William Wood would later carefully note, the Federal line fell back at a [...] "quick route step." [...] But although victorious in their fight, Wood would write that [...] "on no future occasion was our loss so great in so short a time." ...|$|E

50|$|Points {{can be made}} {{either by}} scoring or by an opponent’s fault. When the ball {{contacts}} the floor (the bottom of the trampoline or the inflatables) within the court boundaries (the outer safety zone is out), the team {{on the opposite side}} of the net is awarded a score. The safety border around the trampolines is a free zone. On this “bossawall” the ball may bounce or roll. When the ball <b>lays</b> <b>still</b> on the bossawall, the point goes to the opponent's team.|$|R
