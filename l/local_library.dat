5|$|Libraries in Denmark {{are also}} {{cultural}} and community centres. They {{play an active}} role in the cultural life and host many events, exhibitions, discussion groups, workshops, educational courses and facilitate everyday cultural activities for and by the citizens. In June 2015, the large central library and cultural centre of Dokk1 opened at the harbour front. Dokk1 also includes civil administrations and services, commercial office rentals and a large underground robotic car park and aims to be a landmark for the city and a public meeting place. The building of Dokk1 and the associated squares and streetscape is also collectively known as Urban Mediaspace Aarhus and it is the largest construction project Aarhus municipality has ever undertaken. Apart from this large main library, some neighbourhoods in Aarhus have a <b>local</b> <b>library</b> engaged in similar cultural and educational activities, but on a more local scale.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} summer Whitman {{worked for}} another printer, Erastus Worthington, in Brooklyn. His family {{moved back to}} West Hills in the spring, but Whitman remained and {{took a job at}} the shop of Alden Spooner, editor of the leading Whig weekly newspaper the Long-Island Star. While at the Star, Whitman became a regular patron of the <b>local</b> <b>library,</b> joined a town debating society, began attending theater performances, and anonymously published some of his earliest poetry in the New-York Mirror. At age 16 in May 1835, Whitman left the Star and Brooklyn. He moved to New York City to work as a compositor though, in later years, Whitman could not remember where. He attempted to find further work but had difficulty, in part due to a severe fire in the printing and publishing district, and in part due to a general collapse in the economy leading up to the Panic of 1837. In May 1836, he rejoined his family, now living in Hempstead, Long Island. Whitman taught intermittently at various schools until the spring of 1838, though he was not satisfied as a teacher.|$|E
5|$|Various architects {{were invited}} by an {{appointed}} War Memorial Board to submit designs for a memorial intended to honor all {{who fought in}} World War I and also to provide meeting places, archives, and offices for the American Legion. The partnership of Walker and Weeks of Cleveland, Ohio was chosen in 1923. Their plan consisted of a main memorial and two auxiliary buildings, an obelisk, a mall, and a cenotaph. Bids for the American Legion building, {{one of the two}} auxiliary buildings, were put out in 1925 and construction by the Craig-Curtiss Company began the same year. In style the structure complimented the nearby <b>local</b> <b>library.</b> The second auxiliary building was not constructed until 1950. When Congress authorized the payment of World War I veterans' bonuses in 1936, the state of Indiana used the money for construction of the memorial plaza, rather than paying it to the veterans. The Neoclassical design incorporated the existing library, federal building, and University Park. One additional building was planned but never built.|$|E

Time-based prospective memory involves remembering to perform an action at a particular point in time. For example, seeing that it is 10:00 PM acts as a cue to watch a favorite television show.|$|E

25|$|Committee {{members from}} the <b>local</b> <b>library,</b> the Athenaeum Society and the {{municipality}} held a meeting on 20 October 1856 {{to appeal to the}} colonial government to accord land to erect a Town Hall, which would accommodate municipal offices, a library, a museum and an athenaeum (place of further learning). A Town Hall was erected in 1858, which secured a home for the Athenaeum Society. Thus the society initially operated out of a space in the Town Hall but, as the library and museum grew and expanded into the space which the Athenaeum Society occupied, the society was forced to cease all activities in that space.|$|E

25|$|A {{defining}} {{incident of}} young Wells's life {{was an accident}} in 1874 that left him bedridden with a broken leg. To pass the time he started reading books from the <b>local</b> <b>library,</b> brought {{to him by his}} father. He soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access; they also stimulated his desire to write. Later that year he entered Thomas Morley's Commercial Academy, a private school founded in 1849 following the bankruptcy of Morley's earlier school. The teaching was erratic, the curriculum mostly focused, Wells later said, on producing copperplate handwriting and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen. Wells continued at Morley's Academy until 1880. In 1877, his father, Joseph Wells, fractured his thigh. The accident effectively put an end to Joseph's career as a cricketer, and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income.|$|E

25|$|On October 30, 1873, the Virginius, a munitions and troop {{transportation}} ship {{supporting the}} Cuban Rebellion and flying the U.S. flag, {{was captured by}} Spanish authorities. After a hasty trial in Santiago, Cuba, Spanish authority executed 53 crew members, including American and British citizens. Although Sumner sympathized with the Cuban rebels {{and those who were}} executed by Spanish Republican authority, he refused to support U.S. military intervention or the annexation of Cuba. On November 17, 1873, when located by a reporter, Sumner stated his views in an interview on the Virginius Affair at a <b>local</b> <b>library</b> in Boston. Sumner believed that although the ship was flying a U.S. flag, the mission of the ship was illegal. Sumner, who opposed the Cuban insurgent neutrality of the Grant Administration, believed that the United States needed to support the First Spanish Republic. On November 28, 1873, Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, who coolly handled the incident amidst national outcries for war, negotiated a peaceful settlement with Spanish President Emilio Castelar, and prevented war with Spain.|$|E
