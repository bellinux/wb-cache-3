40|$|Energy {{performance}} of lighting systems has assumed a signiﬁcant {{role in the}} assessment of buildings’ consumptions and consequently lighting design is aimed to reduce installed power {{but at the same time}} to achieve an excellent lighting quality both for visual and health purposes. Lighting design is nowadays essentially based on illuminance values on visual tasks and surrounding areas, but today designers’ and researchers’ interest is focused on the analysis of luminance maps obtained through video <b>luminance</b> <b>meters</b> or with numeric simulation tools. Luminance maps availability focus the attention on a more accurate study of the light reaching the eyes (luminance), rather than on the light that arrives on surfaces (illuminance). However luminance values, based on photopic sensitivity, do not always adequately describe the quality of a lit environment and how it is perceived; therefore it is necessary to consider parameters like brightness or equivalent luminance. The ﬁrst part of this work describes primary factors that inﬂuence lit environments’ perception along with the main available luminance–brightness relations. Moreover a software for the luminance maps’ analysis is described with the goal of ﬁnding and testing the most signiﬁcant parameters for the lit environment’s description, both for comfort and energy purposes...|$|R
40|$|NIST has {{recently}} established a detectorbased luminous intensity unit (candela, cd), which {{is derived from}} the NIST absolute cryogenic radiometer. Subsequently, the luminous flux unit (lumen, lm) and the luminance unit (cd/m 2) have been established based on the detector-based candela, and now all the NIST photometric units are tied to the cryogenic radiometer. The illuminance unit is realized and maintained on five standard photometers. The large dynamic range of the standard photometers eliminates the need for maintaining many working standard lamps of various wattages. The luminous intensities of lamps are determined from the illuminances measured with these photometers and the distances measured with a linear encoder system. Transfer photometers and illuminance meters are calibrated by direct comparison with the standard photometers with no distance measurements involved. The luminous flux unit is realized using an absolute integrating sphere method newly developed at NIST. The luminance unit is realized on an integrating sphere source, which is used for calibration of other luminance sources and <b>luminance</b> <b>meters.</b> These detector-based methods have made it possible to reduce the uncertainties of photometric calibrations and to provide more varieties of photometric calibration services at NIST.

40|$|The {{range of}} {{calibration}} of illuminance <b>meters</b> and <b>luminance</b> <b>meters</b> has been normally limited to levels {{up to several}} thousand lx and several thousand cd/m 2 using a high-power luminous intensity standard lamp. The calibration of instruments at much higher levels is required in applications such as daylight measurement, evaluation of solar simulators, and testing light sources in imaging devices. A calibration facility and procedures have been developed at NIST utilizing the detector-based method to allow illuminance calibrations at levels up to 100 klx (about the level of direct sun light) and luminance up to 30 kcd/m 2, The calibration source {{is based on a}} commercial solar simulator source using a 1000 W xenon arc lamp with optical feedback control, and it is combined with a set of color glass filters that corrects the spectral power distribution to be close to CIE Illuminant A. The illuminance level can be varied without changing the color temperature significantly and without changing the distance. The developed source was evaluated for stability, spectral distribution, illuminance uniformity, and divergence of the beam. Experiments were also conducted to study the effect of heat by radiation on the glass filters used with the source and various diffuser materials, such as PTFE, opal glass, and acrylic, used to create luminance standards. The linearity and the effect of heat on standard photometers and commercial illuminance meters were also investigated, and appropriate procedures for high illuminance/luminance calibrations have been established...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a study of}} two issues concerning the calibration of high dynamic range (HDR) photography for luminance measurements in indoor daylit spaces: (i) {{the selection of a}} target in a scene for calibration and (ii) the variation of the calibration factor with different daylight levels. Luminance measurements of coloured and grey targets were conducted in a classroom under stable sky conditions using a calibrated <b>luminance</b> <b>meter</b> and HDR photography.

This study affirms the findings of a previous study that grey targets are more suitable for use in the calibration of HDR photography for luminance measurements. Using a grey surface of 18 % reflectance, the ratio between luminances obtained by the two methods, regarded as the calibration factor, was computed.

Following this way, this paper shows the main results in the connection among instruments devoted specifically to illuminance and luminance measurements. Then, it also introduces a comparison to other photometric heads, e. g., sensors {{that are part of}} more complex systems, like an integrating sphere for luminous flux measurement. In this last case, it has no significance to evaluate the difference between the absolute outputs, but it is interesting to compare the response of the two devices considering their linearity and their relative spectral response. A special section devoted to the evaluation of the spectral response presents a new simple but effective method. The application of a detector-based method allows a significant reduction of the uncertainty in the internal calibration of the photometric instruments, granting the continuity of the Photometric Laboratory operation contemporarily...|$|R
40|$|Measuring the {{brightness}} of the night sky has become an increasingly important topic in recent years, as artificial lights and their scattering by the Earths atmosphere continue spreading around the globe. Several instruments and techniques have been developed for this task. We give an overview of these, and discuss their strengths and limitations. The different quantities that can and should be derived when measuring the night sky brightness are discussed, as well as the procedures that have been and still need to be defined in this context. We conclude that in many situations, calibrated consumer digital cameras with fisheye lenses provide the best relation between ease-of-use and wealth of obtainable information on the night sky. While they do not obtain full spectral information, they are able to sample the complete sky in a period of minutes, with colour information in three bands. This is important, as given the current global changes in lamp spectra, changes in sky radiance observed only with single band devices may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding long term changes in sky brightness. The acquisition of all-sky information is desirable, as zenith-only information does not provide an adequate characterization of a site. Nevertheless, zenith-only single-band one-channel devices such as the Sky Quality Meter continue to be a viable option for long-term studies of night sky brightness and for studies conducted from a moving platform. Accurate interpretation of such data requires some understanding of the colour composition of the sky light. We recommend supplementing long-term time series derived with such devices with periodic all-sky sampling by a calibrated camera system and calibrated luxmeters or <b>luminance</b> <b>meters.</b> Comment: 44 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric {{visibility}} distance is a {{property of the}} atmosphere, which can be remotely sensed by computer vision. In this aim, a non-linear mapping function between the atmospheric {{visibility distance}} and the contrast in images must be estimated. The function depends on the scene depth distribution {{as well as on}} the radiometry of the scene. In order to calibrate and deploy such camera-based atmospheric visibility estimations, we present two methods which aim at computing the scene depth distribution and the radiometry of the scene beforehand. The scene depth is recovered by registering a full 3 D model of the environment in the frame of the camera. The radiometry of the scene is partly recovered by looking at the temporal correlation between the variation of pixels intensity and the variation of the sky luminance estimated by a <b>luminance</b> <b>meter</b> oriented toward the North direction. Based on clear-sky models, it is demonstrated that such a process detects a set of pixels, which include pixels belonging to North-oriented Lambertian surfaces. This finding leads to a simplified way of detecting Lambertian surfaces without any additional <b>luminance</b> <b>meter.</b> Good results obtained experimentally prove that such techniques are relevant to estimate the atmospheric visibility distance. 1...|$|E
30|$|In {{one of the}} {{approaches}} that is able to identify image regions containing semantically meaningful information, the luminance plane is subdivided in blocks of equal dimensions. For each block, statistical measures of contrast and focus are computed [1, 14]. It is assumed that well-focused or high-contrast blocks are more relevant compared to the others and {{will be given a}} higher weight accordingly. In certain applications, features like face and skin-tones can also be used for the weight selection [1, 3, 14]. In cases where skin tones are absent in the image, classical average <b>luminance</b> <b>metering</b> is performed. This approach is often used in video applications for mobile phones, or in general, when humans occupy large parts of an HDR image. However, this rarely occurs for standard cameras. Especially in surveillance applications, the complete person's body is of interest, which is much larger than his face. This is why object-based detection and tracking is of high importance. Such background estimation and adaptation system discriminates interesting foreground objects from the uninteresting background by building the background model of the image [15, 16]. The model stores locations of foreground objects in a separate foreground memory that is used to discard background of the image from the luminance measurements. In cases when no objects of interest are detected, again classical average metering is performed [17]. These object detection models are much better than a simple frame-differencing method, since frame differencing can only distinguish parts of moving objects, and when moving objects suddenly become static, the detection completely fails. On the other hand, a background-modeling metering scheme enables much better results than the conventional approaches, since it is insensitive to the position of an object in the image and it maintains a correct exposure of that object of interest.|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} {{focus on}} embracing daylighting for energy efficient lighting purposes and the corporate sector’s indulgence {{in the perception}} of workplace and work practice “transparency” has spurned an increase in highly glazed commercial buildings. This in turn has renewed issues of visual comfort and daylight-derived glare for occupants. In order to ascertain evidence, or predict risk, of these events; appraisals of these complex visual environments require detailed information on the luminances present in an occupant’s field of view. Conventional <b>luminance</b> <b>meters</b> are an expensive and time consuming method of achieving these results. To create a luminance map of an occupant’s visual field using such a meter requires too many individual measurements to be a practical measurement technique. The application of digital cameras as luminance measurement devices has solved this problem. With high dynamic range imaging, a single digital image can be created to provide luminances on a pixel-by-pixel level within the broad field of view afforded by a fish-eye lens: virtually replicating an occupant’s visual field and providing rapid yet detailed luminance information for the entire scene. With proper calibration, relatively inexpensive digital cameras can be successfully applied to the task of luminance measurements, placing them in the realm of tools that any lighting professional should own. This paper discusses how a digital camera can become a luminance measurement device and then presents an analysis of results obtained from post occupancy measurements from building assessments conducted by the Mobile Architecture Built Environment Laboratory (MABEL) project. This discussion leads to the important realisation that the placement of such tools in the hands of lighting professionals internationally will provide new opportunities for the lighting community in terms of research on critical issues in lighting such as daylight glare and visual quality and comfort. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} reflected-light {{exposure meters}} were wide-angle, averaging types, measuring the average scene <b>luminance.</b> Exposure <b>meter</b> calibration {{was chosen to}} result in the “best” exposures for typical outdoor scenes; when measuring a single scene element (such as {{the side of a}} building in open shade), the indicated exposure is in the approximate middle of the film or electronic sensor's exposure range. When measuring a scene with atypical distribution of light and dark elements, or a single element that is lighter or darker than a middle tone, the indicated exposure may not be optimal. For example, a scene with predominantly light tones (e.g., a white horse) often will be underexposed, while a scene with predominantly dark tones (e.g., a black horse) often will be overexposed. That both scenes require the same exposure, regardless of the meter indication, becomes obvious from a scene that includes both a white horse and a black horse. A photographer usually can recognize the difference between a white horse and a black horse; a meter usually cannot. When metering a white horse, a photographer can apply exposure compensation so that the white horse is rendered as white.|$|R

Today, several luminance meters based on commercial CCD cameras are on the market. They are very attractive for the lighting engineer: The availability of {{a high number of}} closely spaced small detectors (pixels) on a single chip permits analyses almost impossible with a traditional <b>luminance</b> <b>meter.</b> These commercial-industrial CCD cameras are sold at prices lower than scientific grade ones. They are factory equipped with a dedicated filter to reach the correct photopic sensitivity V(A), and they are factory calibrated in luminance SI units. The main counterparts in using these cameras are in the difficulties to define the measurement accuracy and the influence of the environment luminance on the measured values of the framed scene, in the low resolution of their A/D converter (usually 8 or 12 bit), and the higher noise level (usually the CCD chip is not cooled). To reach the measurement accuracy required by lighting norms, it is necessary to characterize metrologically a camera and quantify all the possible external influences which could degrade its performances, in real measurement situations, and which could affect the measurement results. A carefully controlled measurement set up and operating procedure could limit the causes of errors and improve the accuracy of measurements obtained in operating conditions. In this way, the measurement uncertainties might be evaluated completely, and considerations on the results could suggest particular operating practices to limit the causes of error due to measurement setup and environmental conditions...|$|E
