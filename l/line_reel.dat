5000|$|The {{original}} 2" [...] Quad {{videotapes of}} all the episodes of the original 1962-65 series were wiped in the late-1960s. However, these episodes mostly survive on film transfers of the original videotapes as 16mm black and white telerecordings. The exception being [...] "My Old Man's a Tory" [...] which only exists as an optical transfer made from a domestic 405 <b>line</b> <b>reel</b> to reel videotape obtained from Galton and Simpson.|$|E
5000|$|In East Asia, an {{ink line}} {{is used in}} {{preference}} to a chalk line. This is a silken cord, stored on a combined reel and inkpot called a [...] in Japanese. Alongside the <b>line</b> <b>reel</b> is a cavity filled with ink-soaked cotton fibres, which the line is drawn through as it is unreeled. These sumitsubo are highly decorated and much-prized by their owners. As with many such tools, they're often made by their users while apprentices.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} {{distance}} line increment for each sweep should allow some overlap of sweeps {{to avoid the}} risk of missing the target between sweeps. If a buddy is involved the most efficient place is alongside the controlling diver on the line, and the extension of distance line for each sweep can be roughly doubled. Depending on the circumstances, control of the pattern may be from the surface, from a diver at the central point, or by the diver {{at the end of}} the search line, who would in that case control the search <b>line</b> <b>reel.</b>|$|E
40|$|A winch system {{provides}} {{a method for}} launch and recovery capabilities for kites and tethered blimps or balloons. Low power consumption is a key objective, as well as low weight for portability. This is accomplished by decoupling the tether-line storage and wind ing/ unwinding functions, and providing tailored and efficient mechanisms for each. The components of this system include rotational power input devices such as electric motors or other apparatus, <b>line</b> winding/unwinding <b>reel(s),</b> <b>line</b> storage <b>reel(s),</b> and independent drive trains. Power {{is applied to the}} wind/unwind reels to transport the tether line. Power is also applied to a <b>line</b> storage <b>reel,</b> from either the wind/unwind power source, the wind/unwind reel itself, or separate power source. The speeds of the two reels are synchronized, but not dependent on each other. This is accomplished via clutch mechanisms, variable transmissions, or independent motor controls. The speed of the storage reel is modulated as the effective diameter of the <b>reel</b> changes with <b>line</b> accumulation...|$|R

50|$|The spool is {{the storage}} {{area for the}} line. It has a hub and two flanges, which prevent the line from falling off {{the sides of the}} hub. The size of the spool and the {{thickness}} of the line together determine the length of <b>line</b> the <b>reel</b> can hold, though this is also affected by how neatly the line is wound onto the spool.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, a 16mm {{kinescope}} {{was discovered}} by a film archivist that contained lost footage fromtwo live CBS television shows. In addition to a nearly complete broadcast of What's My <b>Line?,</b> the <b>reel</b> of film also featured the final six minutes of Celebrity Time. Both shows were broadcast on October 1. 1950. Conrad Nagel and Kitty Carlisle were among the celebrities seen from the B F Goodrich sponsored program.|$|R
50|$|Penetration reels (also {{known as}} primary or lead reels) {{are used to}} run line from a point with {{direct access to the}} surface to the start of a {{permanent}} line. This may be as much as a few hundred feet into the overhead. These reels will usually carry 300 to 500 ft (90 to 150m) of <b>line.</b> These <b>reels</b> are also used for short penetrations where there is no permanent line.|$|R
50|$|Land-based {{shark fishing}} {{is defined as}} {{attempting}} to capture or actually capturing sharks using a rod, <b>reel,</b> <b>line,</b> and hook(s) from the land or anything permanently attached to the land, for example, jetties, piers or bridges.|$|R
50|$|The {{temporary}} entry {{guide line}} should be tied {{off to the}} permanent <b>line</b> and the <b>reel</b> locked. A recommended method is to make two wraps around the permanent line and then clip the reel back to the line.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, the kites were reeled in, the {{regulators}} being so pulled and eased off {{that they were}} kept just fluttering without tugging during the operation. When, however, they passed out of the wind-stratum into the region of calm which still prevailed immediately above the sea, the kites descended in an alarming manner, swaying to and fro with occasional wild swoops, which rendered it necessary to haul in on the <b>lines</b> and <b>reel</b> up with the utmost speed.|$|R
50|$|Finger spools are a simple, compact {{low tech}} {{alternative}} to reels {{best suited to}} relatively short lengths of line. They are simply a pair of circular flanges {{with a hole in}} the middle, connected by a tubular hub, which is suitably sized to use a finger as an axle when unrolling the line. Line is secured by clipping a bolt snap through a hole on one of the flanges and over the line as it leaves the <b>reel.</b> <b>Line</b> is <b>reeled</b> in by holding the spool with one hand and simply winding the line onto the spool by hand. Spools are most suitable for reasonably short lines, up to about 50m, as it becomes tedious to roll up longer lengths. The small, compact size, and low cost make them useful for various purposes where long line is not required.Spools may be made from any material that is strong enough and suitable for underwater service, but engineering thermoplastics are most common.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} form of {{recreational}} fishing is done with a rod, <b>reel,</b> <b>line,</b> hooks and any one {{of a wide range of}} baits. Lures are frequently used in place of bait. Some people make handmade lures, including plastic lures and artificial flies.|$|R
50|$|Gameplay, {{like other}} {{games in the}} fishing {{simulator}} genre consists of casting a line from a fishing pole to reel in fish. In the game, the player casts the <b>line</b> and <b>reels</b> in fish with the touch screen. Whether or not a player can catch a fish usually depends on timing and {{the placement of the}} tackle. The game includes multiple fishing techniques, including bait fishing as well as fly fishing. The game also includes 15 stages, 40 fish, and over 100 pieces of tackle. Players can also keep caught fish in a fish tank for display.|$|R
60|$|Captain Vane {{was very}} {{successful}} in this rather difficult operation. While he hauled in the <b>line</b> Benjy <b>reeled</b> it up with exemplary speed, and the kite was finally made to descend on the boat like a cloud. When secured the locking-cross was removed, the distending-rods were folded inwards, the restraining, or what we may term the waist-band was applied, and the whole affair was changed into a gigantic Mrs Gamp umbrella. Being placed in {{the bow of the}} boat, projecting over the water, it formed a not ungraceful though peculiar bowsprit, and was well out of the way.|$|R
25|$|Another form of ascent {{which may}} be {{considered}} an emergency ascent is a tethered-ascent – where the diver has unintentionally lost full control of buoyancy due {{to a loss of}} ballast weight, and controls ascent rate by use of a ratchet dive reel {{with the end of the}} <b>reel</b> <b>line</b> secured to the bottom.|$|R

50|$|Automatic fly reels use a {{coiled spring}} {{mechanism}} that pulls the <b>line</b> into the <b>reel</b> with the flick of a lever.

Automatic fly reels peaked in popularity during the 1960s, and since that time they have been outsold many times over by manual fly reels.|$|R
50|$|An arbor knot is tied {{by first}} passing the <b>line</b> around the <b>reel</b> arbor. The tag end is then tied in an {{overhand}} knot around the running line. Finally, an overhand knot is tied in the tag end. When tightened, the overhand knot in the tag end jams against the overhand knot tied around the running line.|$|R
