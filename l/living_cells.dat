40|$|BACKGROUND: Imaging the {{behavior}} of RNA in a <b>living</b> <b>cell</b> is a powerful means for understanding RNA functions and acquiring spatiotemporal information in a single cell. For more distinct RNA imaging in a <b>living</b> <b>cell,</b> a more effective chemical method to fluorescently label RNA is now required. In addition, development of the technology labeling with different colors for different RNA {{would make it easier}} to analyze plural RNA strands expressing in a cell. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Tag technology for RNA imaging in a <b>living</b> <b>cell</b> has been developed based on the unique chemical functions of exciton-controlled hybridization-sensitive oligonucleotide (ECHO) probes. Repetitions of selected 18 -nucleotide RNA tags were incorporated into the mRNA 3 '-UTR. Pairs with complementary ECHO probes exhibited hybridization-sensitive fluorescence emission for the mRNA expressed in a <b>living</b> <b>cell.</b> The mRNA in a nucleus was detected clearly as fluorescent puncta, and the images of the expression of two mRNAs were obtained independently and simultaneously with two orthogonal tag-probe pairs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A compact and repeated label has been developed for RNA imaging in a <b>living</b> <b>cell,</b> based on the photochemistry of ECHO probes. The pairs of an 18 -nt RNA tag and the complementary ECHO probes are highly thermostable, sequence-specifically emissive, and orthogonal to each other. The nucleotide length necessary for one tag sequence is much shorter compared with conventional tag technologies, resulting in easy preparation of the tag sequences with a larger number of repeats for more distinct RNA imaging...|$|R

40|$|Architectural beauty attracts many {{travellers}} to Europe. The {{participants of}} this conference were also attracted by architectural beauty, however the focus {{in our case}} was on the architectural beauty of the <b>living</b> <b>cell.</b> The <b>living</b> <b>cell</b> {{is not only an}} architectural masterpiece, but possesses fluidity and dynamism even the most gifted artisans would have found impossible to represent in stone. The architectural beauty of the <b>living</b> <b>cell</b> is created by a complex interplay between lipid bilayer membranes and the proteins that lie underneath them at the cortex. The architecture of the <b>living</b> <b>cell</b> is extraordinarily responsive to changes that occur within cells (intrinsic events) and in the extracellular environment (extrinsic events). Complex and interwoven signalling pathways link the intrinsic and extrinsic events to changes in cell shape and behaviour and those that have been identified and studied probably represent only a minority. What has become apparent, however, is the central and unique role of a group of phospholipid-binding and signalling proteins in these various pathways: the BAR, F-BAR, and I-BAR domain proteins. 2 The founding member of these families was the BAR domain. The BAR domain is a class of phospholipid binding domain that possesses the ability to sense membrane curvature. In conjunctio...|$|R
5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} is {{the design}} and manufacture of artificial nucleic acid structures for technological uses.

5|$|More recently, {{evidence}} for common descent {{has come from}} the study of biochemical similarities between organisms. For example, all <b>living</b> <b>cells</b> use the same basic set of nucleotides and amino acids. The development of molecular genetics has revealed the record of evolution left in organisms' genomes: dating when species diverged through the molecular clock produced by mutations. For example, these DNA sequence comparisons have revealed that humans and chimpanzees share 98% of their genomes and analysing the few areas where they differ helps shed light on when the common ancestor of these species existed.|$|E
5|$|NAD and NADH {{also differ}} in their fluorescence.
