He spoke out {{in opposition to the}} monarchy, declaring in 1971 that [...] "the whole of the royal establishment from the Queen downwards could go, lock stock and barrel tomorrow". He extended his criticism to the hereditary peerage in February 1973. In 1974 he and fellow Labour MP Willie Hamilton took the required oath declaring their allegiance to the Queen, then admitted that they had not meant it. The same year, he criticised the number of Royal servants who appeared on the biannual honours lists, calling instead for [...] "scores of miners" [...] to be honoured as they were just as worthy.|$|E

He scored 14 points on 5 of 12 shooting and grabbed 3 rebounds, but his team lost to the South team 134125. Among his teammates in the Classic was Kentucky signee Sean Woods, who told the Lexington Herald-Leader that he and Farmer had become good friends and that he hoped Farmer would choose {{to play for the}} Wildcats. The paper also reported that Farmer had narrowed his list of potential college choices to three: Western Kentucky, LSU, and Kentucky. Farmer took an official visit to Western Kentucky the weekend of April 9, 1988, but on April 14, {{the second day of the}} April signing period, he held a press conference at his high school gymnasium to announce that he had signed a National Letter of Intent with Kentucky. He told the assembled crowd, [...] " [...] been a dream of mine as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b> Even before kindergarten, I always wanted to play for Kentucky." ...|$|E
500|$|Many critics responded very {{positively}} to Inside No. 9. After the final {{episode of the}} first series, the comedic critic Bruce Dessau said on his website that it had [...] "really set an early benchmark to beat for comedy of the year. It has been consistently compelling as each week we entered an entirely different world." [...] On the same day, David Chater, writing in The Times, said of the series as a whole that [...] "t's hard to know which to admire more – the rich and perverse imaginations of Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith or the extraordinary range of acting talent that has brought this strange and memorable series to life." [...] Chater had previously described [...] "A Quiet Night In", the second episode of Inside No. 9, as [...] "the funniest, cleverest, most imaginative and original television I have seen for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> – one of those fabulous programmes where time stands still and the world around you disappears". Mark Jones (The Guardian) considered the whole series, saying that the Inside No. 9 was [...] "never less-than-captivating", while a review in the Liverpool Echo described every episode as [...] "intriguing and lovingly-crafted", though {{it was felt that}} the first three episodes were stronger than the latter three. In December 2014, Metro television critic Keith Watson named Inside No. 9 the twentieth best television programme of 2014, and in January 2015, Daily Star Sunday columnist Garry Bushell named Inside No. 9 the best comedy TV programme of 2014.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} made {{available}} for streaming at Big Boi's MySpace page. Following leaks of several of its tracks, the album also leaked in its entirety to the Internet on June 29. Prior to its official release, anti-piracy companies had estimated that his tracks were being downloaded approximately 45,000 times a day. On July 1, Big Boi self-released his mixtape Mixtape for Dummies: Guide to Global Greatness as a free download through his website, featuring tracks compiled by DJ X-Rated and DJ Esco from Big Boi's solo recordings and work with OutKast. Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty was released by Big Boi's imprint Purple Ribbons label and Def Jam Recordings on July 5 in the United Kingdom and on July 6 in the US. A deluxe edition of the album was released simultaneously in the US, with the inclusion of two bonus tracks and a second DVD of music videos for several songs. Big Boi's official website store offered limited edition releases of the album, including the deluxe edition's two discs, ivory white vinyl LPs, a limited edition T-shirt, and a custom GoodWood chain. In promotion of the album's release, Converse produced a special limited edition run of Chuck Taylor All-Stars shoes in August 2010. The shoes were designed by Big Boi himself and feature the album title printed around the outer sides of the shoe's heel. On the collaboration, Big Boi {{said in a statement}} [...] "as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> music and Converse have gone hand in hand, so partnering up with them was a no-brainer".|$|E

He has been recording for most of his life, telling Foxy Digitalis that [...] "I've made music as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> - ever since I was a child - and recorded the stuff as long as I've had the technology - I began with a cheap cassette player. So, it's strange to think what it'd be like not to make or record music. It seems unnatural!". When reviewing his 1996 CD Festival, Melody Maker described him as [...] "grand-meister of contemporary British improv, spiritual son of Eddie Prevost and Maddy Prior; gentle manipulator of English hymn-notics and religious incantations; protege, challenger and radicaliser of folk, blues, rock, minimalism and improvisation; translator for the sea and the rain and the sky; ambassador to war and peace, to love and anguish".|$|E
