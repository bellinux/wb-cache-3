5|$|The pouring {{process has}} an {{influence}} on a beer's presentation. The rate of flow from the tap or other serving vessel, tilt of the glass, and position of the pour (in the centre or down the side) into the glass all influence the end result, such as the size and longevity of the head, <b>lacing</b> (the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk), and the release of carbonation.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} <b>lacing</b> method, termed {{criss-cross}} <b>lacing,</b> {{is also one}} of the strongest and most efficient, but is not so well suited to certain dress shoes, such as Oxfords, because the central shoelace crossovers prevent the sides of the shoe from coming together in the middle. For such shoes, methods such as straight <b>lacing</b> are better suited.|$|E
25|$|Corsets {{are held}} {{together}} by <b>lacing,</b> usually (though not always) at the back. Tightening or loosening the <b>lacing</b> produces corresponding changes in the firmness of the corset. Depending on the desired effect and time period, corsets can be laced from the top down, from the bottom up, or both {{up from the bottom}} and down from the top, using two laces that meet in the middle. In the Victorian heyday of corsets, a well-to-do woman's corset laces would be tightened by her maid, and a gentleman's by his valet. However, Victorian corsets also had a buttoned or hooked front opening called a busk. If the corset was worn loosely, it was possible to leave the <b>lacing</b> as adjusted and take the corset on and off using the front opening. (If the corset is worn snugly, this method will damage the busk if the <b>lacing</b> is not significantly loosened beforehand). Self-lacing is very difficult with tightlacing - also called waist training - which strives for the utmost possible reduction of the waist. The type of corset and bodice <b>lacing</b> became a refined mark of class; women who could not afford servants often wore front-laced bodices.|$|E
50|$|Part <b>lace</b> or {{sectional}} <b>lace</b> {{is a way}} {{of making}} bobbin <b>lace.</b> It characterises various styles, such as Honiton <b>lace</b> or Brussels <b>lace.</b>|$|R
50|$|Types of bobbin tape <b>lace</b> include Russian <b>lace,</b> Idrija, Schneeberg, Milanese <b>lace</b> and Hinojosa <b>lace.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Greek <b>lace</b> is {{considered}} one of the earliest forms of all <b>lace.</b> Some types of Greek <b>lace</b> include reticella, Roman <b>lace,</b> cutwork, Venetian guipure, and Greek point <b>lace</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Shoelaces, {{also called}} shoestrings (US English) or bootlaces (UK English), are a system {{commonly}} used to secure shoes, boots and other footwear.They typically consist {{of a pair of}} strings or cords, one for each shoe, finished off at both ends with stiff sections, known as aglets. Each shoelace typically passes through a series of holes, eyelets, loops or hooks {{on either side of the}} shoe. Loosening the <b>lacing</b> allows the shoe to open wide enough for the foot to be inserted or removed. Tightening the <b>lacing</b> and tying off the ends secures the foot within the shoe.|$|E
25|$|As a fitted style emerged under Spanish influence, {{the gown}} was {{made as a}} {{separate}} bodice and skirt; this bodice usually fastened at the side or the side-back with hooks and eyes or <b>lacing.</b>|$|E
25|$|The heading {{course in}} English garden wall bond {{sometimes}} features bricks {{of a different}} colour to its surrounding stretchers. In English chalk districts, flint is substituted for the stretchers, and the headers constitute a <b>lacing</b> course.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{continuous}} <b>lace,</b> {{meaning that it}} was made in one piece on a <b>lace</b> pillow, using the same threads in the pattern as in the ground, or réseau. Antwerp <b>lace</b> {{is very similar to}} Mechlin <b>lace,</b> which was also made in Antwerp. Antwerp <b>lace</b> is heavier and sturdier than Mechlin <b>lace.</b> It has a cordonnet, or a flat thread outlining the pattern, just as Mechlin <b>lace</b> does. The cordonnet was very strong and rather coarse. Antwerp <b>lace</b> was also similar to Binche <b>lace</b> in its cordonnet. The réseau or ground for Antwerp <b>lace</b> varies from the same hexagonal ground as Mechlin <b>lace</b> to a tessellation-pattern featuring a six-pointed star.|$|R
50|$|Genoese <b>lace</b> was a guipure <b>lace.</b> Genoese lacemakers went to Malta {{to found}} {{the style of}} Maltese <b>lace.</b> This later {{inspired}} the style of English <b>lace</b> known as Bedfordshire <b>lace.</b>|$|R
50|$|Battenberg <b>lace</b> {{is a type}} of tape <b>lace.</b> The {{name for}} this American <b>lace</b> was chosen in honour of a wedding of the Battenberg family, which {{occurred}} about the time a patent for making the <b>lace</b> was applied for at Washington. Originally Battenberg <b>lace</b> was heavier than the other machine tape <b>laces</b> such as Princess <b>lace.</b>|$|R
25|$|Elastic laces both {{make the}} <b>lacing</b> more comfortable, {{as well as}} {{allowing}} the shoe to be slipped on and off without tying or untying, which makes them a popular choice for children, the elderly and athletes.|$|E
25|$|The proper {{length of}} a shoelace, fitting it to a shoe, varies {{according}} {{to the type of}} <b>lacing</b> used, as well as the type of lace. However, at a rough reference the following guide can be used.|$|E
25|$|Moderate <b>lacing</b> is not {{incompatible}} with vigorous activity. During {{the second half}} of the 19th century, when corset wearing was common among women, sport corsets were specifically designed for wear while bicycling, playing tennis, or horseback riding, as well as for maternity wear.|$|E
50|$|Some regard Battenberg <b>lace</b> {{as a type}} of Renaissance <b>lace.</b> Others regard Renaissance <b>Lace</b> as a {{different}} type of tape <b>lace.</b>|$|R
50|$|Needle <b>lace</b> (also {{known as}} needlelace or needle-made <b>lace</b> or point <b>lace)</b> {{is a type}} of <b>lace</b> created using a needle and thread to stitch up {{hundreds}} of small stitches to form the <b>lace</b> itself.|$|R
5000|$|Originally crocheted <b>lace</b> was not {{regarded}} as true <b>lace.</b> Crocheting {{was considered an}} easy, and less time-consuming, but otherwise clearly inferior surrogate for [...] "true" [...] <b>lace</b> such as bobbin <b>lace,</b> needle <b>lace</b> or [...] netting. The first examples of crocheted <b>lace</b> try to reproduce the products of other lacemaking techniques as faithfully as possible. Later, the many possibilities and inherent beauty of crocheted <b>lace</b> were appreciated more.|$|R
25|$|This is {{the process}} of running the {{shoelaces}} through the holes, eyelets, loops, or hooks to hold together the sides of the shoe with many common <b>lacing</b> methods. There are, in fact, almost two trillion ways to lace a shoe with six pairs of eyelets.|$|E
25|$|The {{boots were}} made from felt and leather and though heavy would be {{comfortable}} and wide enough to accommodate the trousers tucked in before <b>lacing</b> tightly. They were heelless, though the soles were thick and lined with fur. Worn with felt socks, the feet were unlikely to get cold.|$|E
25|$|As for {{shoelaces}} in {{the sense}} that we know them in modern times, the Museum of London has documented examples of medieval footwear dating from as far back as the 12th century, which clearly show the <b>lacing</b> passing through a series of hooks or eyelets down the front or side of the shoe.|$|E
50|$|The Scranton <b>Lace</b> Company, {{also known}} as the Scranton <b>Lace</b> Curtain Company and Scranton <b>Lace</b> Curtain Manufacturing Company, was an American <b>lace</b> {{manufacturer}} in Scranton, Pennsylvania.|$|R
50|$|The {{very early}} bobbin <b>laces</b> were {{probably}} made freehand, as pins were scarce, coarse, and expensive. At first, the <b>laces</b> were purely utilitarian: “seaming” <b>laces</b> (insertions) joining narrow widths of fabric, and toothed or scalloped <b>laces</b> reinforcing the edges (edgings). Many {{of the later}} freehand <b>laces</b> were also functional, but some areas produced very wide ornamental <b>laces.</b>|$|R
50|$|Arras <b>lace</b> {{refers to}} a form of pure white bobbin <b>lace</b> that was made at Arras, France, from the 17th to 19th centuries. It is similar to, but {{stronger}} than Lille <b>lace.</b> Arras also produced gold <b>lace</b> and a lightweight <b>lace</b> called mignonette.|$|R
25|$|Corsets that {{enhanced}} cleavage {{were introduced}} in the mid-16th century. By the late 18th century, cleavage-enhancing corsets grew more dramatic in pushing the breasts upward. The tight <b>lacing</b> of corsets worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries emphasized both cleavage {{and the size of}} the bust and hips. Especially evening or ball gowns were designed to display and emphasize the décolletage.|$|E
25|$|Cowboy {{boots are}} a {{specific}} style of riding boot which combines function with fashion. They became popular among cowboys {{in the western}} United States during the 19th century. Traditional cowboy boots have a Cuban heel, rounded to pointed toe, high shaft, and, traditionally, no <b>lacing.</b> They are normally made from cowhide leather but may be made from more exotic skins such as ostrich, anaconda, or elephant skins.|$|E
25|$|Despite not forcing {{anything}} {{into the}} mouth, mouth corsets are usually {{very effective in}} gagging the victim. This {{is due to the}} fact that the chin piece prevents the wearer from opening their mouth and dislodging the gag, and the <b>lacing</b> at the back of the corset holds the gag tightly against the mouth, making a very effective seal. In addition, it compresses the wearer's cheeks.|$|E
25|$|Most uppers have a mechanism, such as <b>laces,</b> straps with buckles, zippers, elastic, velcro straps, buttons, or snaps, for {{tightening}} the upper on the foot. Uppers with <b>laces</b> {{usually have a}} tongue that helps seal the <b>laced</b> opening and protect the foot from abrasion by the <b>laces.</b> Uppers with <b>laces</b> also have eyelets or hooks {{to make it easier}} to tighten and loosen the <b>laces</b> and to prevent the <b>lace</b> from tearing through the upper material. An aglet is the protective wrapping on the end of the <b>lace.</b>|$|R
50|$|Torchon <b>lace</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} <b>laces,</b> and is common to many lace-making regions such as Belgium, France, Italy, Saxony, Sweden and Spain. Due to its simplicity, torchon <b>lace</b> is {{generally}} the first <b>lace</b> a lacemaker learns to make, and has been since at least the 19th century. It only requires a few bobbins and uses thicker thread than other <b>laces,</b> which makes it easier to learn on. It is also the simplest of all the grounded <b>laces.</b> Beggar's <b>lace</b> is an alternative term for torchon <b>lace.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the 1870s {{the second}} French empire collapsed, {{concurrently}} fashion changed. The cheaper guipures were affected but the better Brussels <b>laces</b> stayed {{in demand for}} wedding trousseaux. Designs and technique however remained much the same. [...] Individuality of <b>lace</b> types decreased and interest for making <b>lace</b> as a hobby increased. In the 1880s the <b>lace</b> industry revived with imitations of old <b>laces.</b> Aalst developed a <b>lace</b> with a technique based on Duchesse <b>lace.</b> The frequent little roses gave the <b>lace</b> its name: Rosaline. The same name {{has been used for}} a seventeenth century Venetian needle <b>lace</b> with similar design. The Belgian Rosaline was produced until the 1950s and rediscovered in 1980s. The <b>lace</b> is flexible to changing fashion. Worn and unsold pieces could be reassembled.|$|R
25|$|The plant attracts its insect prey with {{secretions}} from extrafloral nectaries {{on the lip}} of {{the pitcher}} leaves, as well as a combination of the leaves' color and scent. Slippery footing at the pitcher's rim, aided in at least one species by a narcotic drug <b>lacing</b> the nectar, causes insects to fall inside, where they die and are digested by the plant with proteases and other enzymes.|$|E
25|$|The first {{mention of}} a women's ice hockey game {{occurred}} in Medicine Hat in 1897. Two years later, the Edmonton Ladies Hockey Team were the first Canadian women's hockey team to endorse a commercial product. In an 1899 team photo, the Ladies Club is pictured <b>lacing</b> up Starr Acme Club skates. In the winter of 1937, intergender matches were contested in Alberta. A ladies club from Nanton, Alberta was formed and they defeated a local men's club by a 3–2 score.|$|E
25|$|The large flat wooden {{ceiling in}} the Church of St Michael, Hildesheim of c. 1200 has {{the space to}} include a complex {{iconographic}} scheme based around the tree, which encompasses Adam and Eve, the Prophets and the Four Evangelists. Panel paintings are rare, but a German example of c. 1470 (Darmstadt) shows a Tree {{on the outside of}} the wings of a triptych. A large Polish baroque oil by Michael Willmann (1678, Kościół Wniebowzięcia NMP, Krzeszów) shows a typically crowded Baroque apotheosis scene, with thin tendrils <b>lacing</b> round the figures, but not supporting them.|$|E
50|$|The Barmen <b>lace</b> machine {{makes perfect}} copies of torchon <b>lace</b> and the simpler hand-made bobbin <b>lace.</b> Its bobbins imitate the {{movements}} of the bobbins of the hand-made <b>lace</b> maker.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a modern}} <b>lace</b> school in Bruges called the Kantcentrum. This {{delivers}} <b>lace</b> courses, runs its own publishing house for books and <b>lace</b> patterns and organises <b>lace</b> workshops.|$|R
