Pulping process is semichemical open caustic soda. Pulp that have been processed then formed. into-MDF with wet process. physical and mechanical <b>lests</b> are done for density, moisture content, water absorption, thickness and volume swelling, tensile strength, modulus of elasticity :Range of pulp yield produced in the experiment was 67 - 82 %. The mixed wood composition of 25 % mangiuin, 28 % sengon, 24 % ampupu and 23 % leda, processed wilh 35 g/l NaOH produced pulp yield in accordance with FAO standard, like wise, mixed wood camposilion of 32 % mangiun, 37 % sengon and 31 % ampupu cooked with 35 and 40 g/l NaOH Physical and mechanical properties for five mixed wood compositions done in the experiment meet FAO standard if processed with 35 g/l NaOH, except for tensile strerigth. The resulis showed that wood chips composition, cooking liquor coecentration of them caused a significant effecl on tensile strength, modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity, but these factors did not influence the density, water absorption and thickness swelling...|$|E

The main aim of this research is to explore effectiveness of artificial neural network (ANN) models for automated recognition of gait changes due to falllng behaviour. Minimum foot clearance (MFC) during contmuous walking on a treadmill was recorded on 10 healthy elderly and 10 elderly with reported balance problem and tripping falls history. MFC histogram characteristic features were used as inputs to a three-layer ANN model with backpropagation error corrections algorithm to build relationships between MFC features and healthy/balance-impaired category. A number of <b>lests</b> were performed to find out optimum architecture of the ANN system i. c., number of hidden layers and neurons. Cross-validation and Jack-knife techniques were utilized for training the models and subsequently, testing model performance of the trained ANN models. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) plots, sensitivity and specificity results as well as accuracy rates were used to evaluate performance of the diagnostic model. Test results indicate that ANN architecture with I hidden layer consisting of 8 neurons would be sufficient for providing optimal performance. The generalization pe. rrornlance of the diagnostic model was found to be > 91. 7...|$|E

40|$|Energy saving, {{emission}} reduction and {{increased use of}} renewables are key strategies to achieve the European 20 - 20 - 20 goals, but they require a novel approach to energy demand and supply, integrated with spatial planning. New sustainable energy technologies as Small and Medium Wind Turbines (SMWT) often have an extensive spatial footprint with a high associated impact on both, space and energy provision. This paper proposes a planning support tool that enables SMWT location assessment via a user-friendly open source web-based GIS platform. The tool has been designed {{with reference to the}} legislative framework on environmental impact assessment of SMWT in Flanders. It {{has the potential to be}} used as strategic spatial-environmental tool - in due time Europe-wide - since it is based on the <b>LESTS</b> assessment (Legal, Economic, Spatial, Technical and Social analysis) and it provides insight at two spatial planning levels. At the regional planning scale the tool provides information on spatial and geographical constraints by generating an environmentally compatible SMWT energy potential map. At a local level the tool indicates the optimal SMWT location by estimating the system's annual energy output and the investment payback time for SMWTs of different technology characteristics and sizes. The paper tests and validates the proposed tool in Flanders, while contributing to the sustainability assessment process of local renewable energy use...|$|E
40|$|The {{so-called}} 20 / 20 / 20 {{goals of}} the European Union are key measures {{in the context of}} the sustainable development policy of the EU. The highest potential for emission reductions is present in the electricity sector. Hitherto, the Flemish government mainly invested in photovoltaic panels and large (mainly offshore) wind turbines. However, studies prove that the use of small and medium size wind turbines may claim a part. Despite their potential, though, the market for wind turbines minus 100 kW is not yet developed. ‘Windkracht 13 ’ is a demonstration and dissemination project in the frame of the New Industrial Policy of the Flemish government and aims at opening the market for small and medium size wind turbines (SMWT) in Flanders. The project studies the current barriers by performing a focused <b>LESTS</b> (Legal, Economic, Spatial, Technical, Social) analysis. Based on this pentagonal mapping, recommendations are made for lowering the thresholds to install SMWT in Flanders. Starting from realistic and pragmatic criteria, new locations are explored. The (re) use of masts and towers is a study focus, as well as the potential of rural and industrial environments. Farm sites and business parks often have a high wind energy profile, combined with specific (renewable) energy requirements, thus offering perspective for SMWT. Active participation of the project stakeholders in the users committee is encouraged, leading to implementation of SMWT at strategic locations. These demonstrations are necessary to increase the social acceptance of SMWT. The project results and recommendations are bundled in a best practices manual for a successful implementation of SMWT in Flanders...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{self renewal}} {{capability}} of limbal epithelial stem (<b>LEST)</b> cells {{is fundamental to}} the maintenance and healing of corneal epithelium. Limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), due to dysfunction or loss of <b>LEST</b> cells, therefore presents as persistent epithelial defects, corneal vascularization, conjunctivalization etc. Stem cell-based therapy, in its simplest form – limbal autograft, has been used successfully {{for more than a}} decade. For bilateral LSCD, similar approaches with limbal allografts have been unsuccessful largely due to strong immune rejection. Therefore, as an alternate strategy for treating bilateral LSCD, ex vivo expansion of the remaining <b>LEST</b> cells or autologous stem cells sourced from other potential sites is being explored. Different culture systems (with and without xenobiotic supplements) using substrates like amniotic membrane or fibrin gels have been used successfully for ex vivo <b>LEST</b> cell maintenance and reproduction by imitating the stem cell niche. This paper is organized into sections reviewing the <b>LEST</b> cells, LSCD and various stem cell-based approaches for treating LSCD and discussing future direction and challenges...|$|R
