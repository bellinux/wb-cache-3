40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceThis {{research}} {{presented a}} novel method for {{transmission and distribution}} <b>lines</b> <b>inspection.</b> Power <b>lines</b> <b>inspection</b> can guarantee the performance of power system stability and increase the lifetime of power lines. An advanced power <b>lines</b> <b>inspection</b> can prevent massive power outages due to line failures, which {{is still one of}} the major challenges in modern power system. Traditiional method is using human squads to perform inspections. Due to the remoted locations of power lines, and various geographical conditions, it is not hte most efficient solution by dispatching human squads. Another popular method is using helicopters to inspect power lines, which is costly and there are limitations due to weather conditions. In this research, a combination of Scale Ivariant Feature Transform algorithm and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) power <b>lines</b> real-time <b>inspection</b> system is presented. SIFT algorithm is widely used in object recognition, and it can help USAVs to reduce the vibration problems due to wind or other weather issues, while videoing power lines. The advantage of SIFT method of being invariant to image translation, scaling and rotation has been fully implemented in the proposed work. The video is processing to ground station and the final inspection analysis is performed frame by frame to locate or to recognize potentioal unhealty power lines...|$|R

30|$|Control of {{electric}} power transmission <b>lines</b> may involve <b>inspection</b> of high voltage insulators and other connecting devices, especially for diagnostic purposes. In the majority of countries, helicopters are used in this context, but they generally cannot stay too close to transmission lines for observation due to noise and disturbance issues [8]. The distance is commonly between 20 and 100  m, depending on the equipment used and at a height of about 10 – 15  m from the ground. Moreover, utilizing helicopter for power transmission <b>lines</b> <b>inspection</b> is always extremely costly and dangerous in some cases. Therefore, using light UAS can be a reliable and inexpensive alternative to previous methods.|$|R
