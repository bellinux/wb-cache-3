5|$|Before the 20th century, and in {{some cases}} as late as the 1940s, historians largely took ancient {{literary}} sources at face value as evidence for the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in the ancient world. In the middle of the 20th century this began to change. Early innovations in the study of women in ancient history began in France, as the Annales School began to take a greater interest in underrepresented groups. Robert Flacelière was an influential early author on women in Greece. Around the same time, feminist philosophy, such as Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex also examined the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in the classical world.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Fries Lummis Ellet (October 18, 1818 – June 3, 1877) was an American writer, {{historian}} and poet. She {{was the first}} writer to record the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> who contributed to the American Revolutionary War.|$|E
5|$|During her training, {{she worked}} with the {{district}} nurses, visiting families in the Melbourne's less affluent suburbs. Her ambition {{was to become a}} doctor who improved the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and children. Women of her own social class did not normally work after they married, so marriage was not something she had intended. In 1919, with the war over, she wrote to Ned urging him to complete his Rhodes Scholarship studies before returning to Australia.|$|E

5|$|Medieval England was {{a patriarchal}} {{society and the}} <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> were heavily {{influenced}} by contemporary beliefs about gender and authority. However, the position of women varied considerably according to various factors, including their social class; whether they were unmarried, married, widowed or remarried; and in which {{part of the country}} they lived. Significant gender inequities persisted throughout the period, as women typically had more limited life-choices, access to employment and trade, and legal rights than men.|$|E
5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} family, Workman was {{educated in the}} finest schools {{available}} to women and traveled in Europe. Her marriage to William Hunter Workman cemented these advantages, and, after being introduced to climbing in New Hampshire, Fanny Workman traveled the world with him. They were able to capitalize on their wealth and connections to voyage around Europe, North Africa, and Asia. The couple had two children, but Fanny Workman was not a motherly type; they left their children in schools and with nurses, and Workman saw herself as a New Woman who could equal any man. The Workmans began their travels with bicycle tours of Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Algeria and India. They cycled thousands of miles, sleeping wherever they could find shelter. They wrote books about each trip and Fanny frequently commented {{on the state of}} the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> that she saw. Their early bicycle tour narratives were better received than their mountaineering books.|$|E
5|$|Historian Nancy Rabinowitz {{argues that}} ancient Greek red vase images portraying women {{with their arms}} around another woman's waist, or leaning on a woman's {{shoulders}} can be construed as expressions of romantic desire. Much of the daily <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in ancient Greece is unknown, specifically their expressions of sexuality. Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage, {{there is no clear}} evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with dildos placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.|$|E

5|$|In the 1840s, {{women in}} America were {{reaching}} out for greater control of their lives. Husbands and fathers directed the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> and many doors were closed to female participation. State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, signing contracts, serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they could expect only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work. In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 {{as an attempt to}} find a way in which men and women could work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.|$|E

25|$|In {{almost every}} country in the world, men are put above women. Although this case is not true for every country, it applies to most of the world.

She also edited a children's magazine Balak and developed Sakhi Samiti as a means for improving the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> She was the author of several books.

Working on excavations until 1935, Walker continued to add artifacts to her new finds of pottery of the Neolithic period. At this point in her career, she had become the foremost expert of the Neolithic Period in Southern Greece.|$|E

25|$|As Erakat depicts {{in these}} anecdotes, the conflations and misconceptions of the west, {{that are a}} product of lack of {{representation}} {{of the reality of}} Arab women’s lives and experiences, as well as biased perspectives of what their cultural expressions actually mean, lead to problematic conclusions for many westerners. It is easy to draw the conclusions that some of Erakat’s peers drew in these stories she tells, because they lack the insight into how the occupation of the Palestinian territories actually impacts the daily <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> living in these areas. By assuming that their limited knowledge is sufficient, it leads to limited understanding of this extremely complex issue.|$|E
25|$|Huysmans {{followed}} {{it with the}} novel, Marthe, Histoire d'une fille (1876). The {{story of a young}} prostitute, it was closer to Naturalism and brought him to the attention of Émile Zola. His next works were similar: sombre, realistic and filled with detailed evocations of Paris, a city Huysmans knew intimately. Les Soeurs Vatard (1879), dedicated to Zola, deals with the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in a bookbindery. En ménage (1881) is an account of a writer's failed marriage. The climax of his early work is the novella À vau-l'eau (1882) (Downstream or With the Flow), the story of a downtrodden clerk, Monsieur Folantin, and his quest for a decent meal.|$|E
25|$|Already an {{established}} writer (The Vagabond had received three {{votes for the}} prestigious Prix Goncourt), the decades of the 1920s and 1930s were Colette's most productive and innovative period. Set mostly in Burgundy or Paris during the Belle Époque, her work treated married life, sexuality, and the problems of a woman's struggle for independence. It was frequently quasi-autobiographical: Chéri (1920) and Le Blé en herbe (1923) both deal with love between an aging woman and a very young man, a situation reflecting her relationship with Bertrand de Jouvenel and even Goudeket, who was sixteen years her junior. La Naissance du Jour (1928) is her explicit criticism of the conventional <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> expressed in a meditation on age and the renunciation of love through the character of her mother, Sido.|$|E
