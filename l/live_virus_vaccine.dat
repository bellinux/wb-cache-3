25|$|For a time, the {{black-footed ferret}} was {{harvested}} for the fur trade, with the American Fur Company having received 86 ferret skins from Pratt, Chouteau, and Company of St. Louis {{in the late}} 1830s. During {{the early years of}} predator control, black-footed ferret carcasses were likely discarded, as their fur was of low value. This likely continued after the passing of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, for fear of reprisals. The large drop in black-footed ferret numbers began during the 1800s through to the 1900s, as prairie dog numbers declined because of control programs and the conversion of prairies to croplands. Sylvatic plague, a disease caused by Yersinia pestis introduced into North America, also contributed to the prairie dog die-off, though ferret numbers declined proportionately more than their prey, thus indicating other factors may have been responsible. Plague was first detected in South Dakota in a coyote in 2004, and then in ~50,000 acres of prairie dogs on Pine Ridge Reservation in 2005. Thereafter 7,000 acres of prairie dog colonies were treated with insecticide (DeltaDust) and 1,000 acres of black-footed ferret habitat were prophylactically dusted in Conata Basin in 2006–2007. Nevertheless, plague was proven in ferrets in May 2008. Since then each year 12,000 acres of their Conata Basin habitat is dusted and about 50–150 ferrets are immunized with plague vaccine. Inbreeding depression may have also contributed, as studies on black-footed ferrets from Meeteetse, Wyoming revealed low levels of genetic variation. Canine distemper devastated the Meeteetse ferret population in 1985. A <b>live</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccine</b> originally made for domestic ferrets killed large numbers of black-footed ferrets, thus indicating that the species is especially susceptible to distemper.|$|E

In Calfs of one and three month of age, the antibodies tittles obtained for the <b>Lives</b> <b>Virus</b> <b>Vaccine</b> were significantly different to be appareance with the antibodies tittles of the dead <b>virus</b> <b>vaccine.</b> In calves of two month of age, both vaccines don 4 t show significant difference.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) to detect low levels of antibody to respiratory syncytial (RS) virus was compared with a tube dilution neutralization test (NEUT) on sera obtained from children who received a parenteral <b>live</b> RS <b>virus</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Among the children who developed antibody in response to <b>live</b> RS <b>virus</b> <b>vaccine.</b> ELISA was as sensitive as NEUT at detecting antibody increases.

50|$|Although no {{specific}} treatment for acute infection with SuHV1 is available, vaccination can alleviate clinical signs in pigs of certain ages. Typically, mass vaccination of all pigs {{on the farm}} with a modified <b>live</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccine</b> is recommended. Intranasal vaccination of sows and neonatal piglets one to seven days old, followed by intramuscular (IM) vaccination of all other swine on the premises, helps reduce viral shedding and improve survival. The modified live virus replicates {{at the site of}} injection and in regional lymph nodes. Vaccine virus is shed in such low levels, mucous transmission to other animals is minimal. In gene-deleted vaccines, the thymidine kinase gene has also been deleted; thus, the virus cannot infect and replicate in neurons. Breeding herds are recommended to be vaccinated quarterly, and finisher pigs should be vaccinated after levels of maternal antibody decrease. Regular vaccination results in excellent control of the disease. Concurrent antibiotic therapy via feed and IM injection is recommended for controlling secondary bacterial pathogens.|$|E

40|$|Approaches {{to improve}} the {{efficacy}} of the current (killed) influenza <b>virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> include the generation of cold-adapted and genetically engineered influenza viruses containing specific attenuat-ing mutations. It is hoped that these genetically altered viruses, in which the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from circulating strains have been incorporated by reassortment, can be used as safe <b>live</b> influenza <b>virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> to induce a long-lasting protective immune response in humans. In addition, genetically engineered influenza viruses may provide a means for expressing foreign antigens. Immunization of mice with recombinant influenza and vaccinia viruses expressing specific antigens of Plasmodium yoelii resulted in a dramatic protective immune response against malaria in this model. Mice immunized with recombinant influenza viruses expressing human immunodefi-ciency virus (HIV) epitopes generated long-lasting HIV-specific serum antibodies and secretory IgA in the secretory nasal, vaginal, and intestinal mucosa. These results suggest that genetically engi-neered influenza viruses may be developed for use as <b>live</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> against influenza as well as other diseases.

Morbidity caused by BRD was 20. 6 %. The average cost to treat each case of BRD was $ 12. 39. Mortality rate of calves diagnosed and treated for BRD was 5. 9 % vs.. 35 % for those not diagnosed with BRD. Average daily gain differed between treated and non-treated steers during the first 28 days on feed but {{did not differ from}} 28 days to harvest. Net profit was $ 57. 48 lower for treated steers. Eighty-two percent of this difference was due to a combination of mortality and treatment costs. Eighteen percent of the net profit difference was due to improved performance and carcass value of the non-treated steers. Data from 496 steers and heifers in nine feedlot tests were used {{to determine the effects of}} age, weaning, and use of modified <b>live</b> <b>virus</b> or killed <b>vaccines</b> prior to the test to predict BRD.
