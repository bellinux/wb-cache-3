5|$|On 8 June the Regent {{appointed}} Lord Liverpool {{to head a}} new Tory administration. Despite their eulogies {{to their}} fallen leader, {{members of the new}} government soon began to distance themselves from his ministry. Many of the changes that Perceval had opposed were gradually introduced: greater press freedom, Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform. The Orders in Council were repealed on 23 June, but too late to avoid the declaration of war on Britain by the United States. Lord Liverpool's government did not maintain Perceval's resolution in acting against the illegal slave trade, which began to flourish as the authorities <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> Linklater estimates that around 40,000 slaves were illegally transported from Africa to the West Indies, because of lax enforcement of the law.|$|E

The illegal cattle operations kept beef prices in the border region lower and provided cheap stock that helped small ranchers get by. Many early Tombstone residents <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> when it was [...] "only Mexicans" [...] being robbed.|$|E
500|$|The fares on {{the branch}} were {{collected}} by the conductor on the train, who had to pull a cord, similar to {{how it was done}} with trolleys. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, which owned the branch, wanted to reduce service on the branch, and eventually abandon it. [...] They purposely <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> when conductors skimmed something off the top, allowing them to show a lower ridership to the Interstate Commerce Commission, and in return improve their chances for abandoning the branch.|$|E

500|$|Bolkovac {{is portrayed}} as imperfect—a [...] "noble but screwed up" [...] individual. In the film (which roughly mirrors her real life), her {{personal}} life is in disarray. She has lost custody of her children to her ex-husband and goes to Bosnia to earn money to move closer to them. While there, she has {{an affair with a}} fellow peacekeeper. Kondracki wanted to promote the idea of an average protagonist who acted against injustice while her peers <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> Her flaws are offset by her determination to fight the sex trade, and reviewers found these aspects instrumental in making her a three-dimensional character.|$|E
500|$|According to John Brousseau, the bad {{publicity}} led to {{reforms of the}} Hole. Its inmates were allowed to sleep in proper beds in the [...] "Berthing" [...] quarters elsewhere in the compound. Brousseau describes their new seven-days-a-week routine starting when [...] "they got up, showered, {{then went to the}} dining hall at 9:30. They had 30 minutes for breakfast. Then they walked up to the Hole. They sat down at desks. I have no clue what work they did. They worked until 12:30 or 1 pm. Then they were marched back to the dining hall and had 30 minutes for lunch. Then they were marched back to the Hole and were there until 6 pm." [...] After a 30-minute dinner, they were taken to the study hall and stayed there [...] "for two and a half hours, until about 9:30. Then they went to the Hole again to wrap up their day. At 11 or midnight, they'd get marched back to Berthing." [...] Some of the restrictions on contacting people outside the Hole were also said to have been eased. However, other Church staff were still encouraged to avoid contact with the inmates: [...] "You didn't talk to them, you <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way,</b> you'd leave the area if you saw them, it's like the black plague." [...] Brousseau commented: [...] "You stayed away from these people. They're considered the worst of the worst." ...|$|E

Congress did pay Russia for the Alaska Purchase in 1867, but otherwise rejected proposals for any major expansions, such as the proposal by President Ulysses Grant to acquire Santo Domingo.|$|E

2500|$|A {{year after}} the massacre, an {{analysis}} by officials at the U.S. Secret Service of 37 premeditated school shootings found that bullying, which some of the shooters described [...] "in terms that approached torment", played the major role in {{more than two-thirds of}} the attacks. A similar theory was expounded by Brooks Brown in his book on the massacre; he noted that teachers commonly <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> when confronted with bullying, and that whenever Klebold and Harris were the recipients of such incidents from the jocks at Columbine, they would make statements such as: [...] "Don't worry, man. It happens all the time!" [...] if anyone expressed shock or surprise.|$|E

2500|$|On 5 March 2014, RT Washington, D.C. bureau anchor Liz Wahl {{resigned}} on air, blaming RT for propaganda.

In response, RT released a statement: [...] "When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position {{of his or her}} organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional. But when someone makes a big public show of a personal decision, it {{is nothing more than a}} self-promotional stunt. We wish Liz the best of luck on her chosen path".

2500|$|Denver's economy before 1870 {{had been}} rooted in mining; it then grew by {{expanding}} {{its role in}} railroads, wholesale trade, manufacturing, food processing, and servicing the growing agricultural and ranching hinterland. Between 1870 and 1890, manufacturing output soared from $600,000 to $40 million, and population grew {{by a factor of}} 20 times to 107,000. Denver had always attracted miners, workers, whores and travelers. Saloons and gambling dens sprung up overnight. The city fathers boasted of its fine theaters, and especially the Tabor Grand Opera House built in 1881. By 1890, Denver had grown to be the 26th largest city in America, and the fifth-largest city west of the Mississippi River. The boom times attracted millionaires and their mansions, as well as hustlers, poverty and crime. Denver gained regional notoriety with its range of bawdy houses, from the sumptuous quarters of renowned madams to the squalid [...] "cribs" [...] located a few blocks away. Business was good; visitors spent lavishly, then left town. As long as madams conducted their business discreetly, and [...] "crib girls" [...] did not advertise their availability too crudely, authorities took their bribes and <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> Occasional cleanups and crack downs satisfied the demands for reform.|$|E
2500|$|In Shanghai, the [...] "Great Way Government" [...] set {{up its own}} {{police force}} to keep public order in the city {{following}} the retreat of the Nationalist Army after the Battle of Shanghai. The first police were established {{under the leadership of}} Zhang Songlin, the former Jiangsu provincial police commander. Taxes were levied on imports and exports to provide the funding for this new force. This new Shanghai police force accepted anyone, including former criminals that had been released by the retreating Nationalists, and thus it was considered totally unreliable by the Japanese. It was recorded of having committed many crimes and was encouraged to rob citizens of their money because they were paid almost nothing. The police often <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> when crimes were being committed by others in return for bribes. Efforts to improve its performance included the setting up of a cadet training course which took in 300 cadets. It grew from an initial strength of 64 men upon its creation in 1938 to 6,125 personnel by February 1939, and had 11 branch bureaus, 5 police stations, and 8 special units, including a training center, river police corps, and a hospital. The Shanghai police continued to function after the creation of Wang Jingwei's government and the dissolution of the Great Way municipal authority, and further increased to 7,501 as of January 1941.|$|E

2500|$|The Washington Post {{reported}} many ‘green on blue’ attacks {{might have}} been prevented if existing security measures had been applied correctly, but according to NATO officials numerous military guidelines were not followed — by Afghans or Americans — because of concerns that they might slow {{the growth of the}} Afghan army and police. Despite that the current process for vetting recruits is effective, a lack of follow-up has allowed Afghan troops who fell under the sway of the insurgency or grew disillusioned with the Afghan government to remain in the force. In other instances the vetting process for Afghan soldiers and police was never properly implemented. NATO officials knew it according to the Washington Post, but they <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way,</b> worried that extensive background checks could hinder the recruitment process. Also ignored were requirements that Afghans display proper credentials while on base. Many Afghans, even those who were vetted, were never issued official badges, making it impossible to tell who was supposed to have access to any particular facility. Measures specifically designed to curtail attacks (American and NATO service members should for example always carry a loaded magazine in their weapons to save precious moments if attacked by Afghan forces) were also inconsistently applied. The [...] "Guardian Angel" [...] program (The programm calls for one or two soldiers to monitor the Afghans during every mission or meeting. These soldiers, [...] "angels" [...] called and whose identities are not disclosed to the Afghans, must be prepared to fire on anyone who tries to kill a coalition service member.) was often seen as a distraction from NATO’s mission. Calls to minimize off-duty time spent with Afghan troops were similarly thought by NATO officials to undermine the goal of relationship-building, but according to a directive from NATO leaders troops are now being advised to stay away from Afghan soldiers and police officers during vulnerable moments, such as when they are sleeping, bathing or exercising. Additional security measures include improved training for counterintelligence agents, a more intense vetting system for new recruits, establishing an anonymous reporting system for soldiers to report suspicious activity; increasing the presence of Afghan counterintelligence teams among Afghan troops; banning the sale of Afghan army and police uniforms to help stop infiltrators posing as soldiers and policemen; and revetting soldiers when they return home from leave.|$|E
