5|$|In the 2015-2016 school year, {{the school}} {{district}} had a total of 50,394 students, starting from early childhood/pre-kindergarten education through grade 12. The class of 2015 included 3,406 graduates with an annual drop-out rate in grades 9-12 of 1.4%. In 2016, the racial makeup of the district was 39.6% Hispanic, 34.4% White, 14.1% African American, 8.6% Asian, 0.4% American Indian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, and 2.8% with two or more races. This results in Klein ISD being named as the 12th most diverse district {{in the state of}} Texas. Additionally, 40.8% of students in the district are economically disadvantaged, and 14.6% of the students are English <b>Language</b> <b>Learners.</b> The Texas Education Agency also deems 40.7% of Klein ISD as at-risk.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{standard}} or official writing system for Ottawa, a widely accepted system is used in a recent dictionary of Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe, a collection of texts, and a descriptive grammar. The same system is taught in programs for Ojibwe language teachers. One of its goals is to promote standardization of Ottawa writing so that <b>language</b> <b>learners</b> are able {{to read and write}} in a consistent way. By comparison, folk phonetic spelling approaches to writing Ottawa based on less systematic adaptations of written English or French are more variable and idiosyncratic, and do not always make consistent use of alphabetic letters. While the modern orthography is used in a number of prominent publications, its acceptance is not universal. Prominent Ottawa author Basil Johnston has explicitly rejected it, preferring to use a form of folk spelling in which the correspondences between sounds and letters are less systematic. Similarly, a lexicon representing Ottawa as spoken in Michigan and another based on Ottawa in Oklahoma, use English-based folk spellings distinct from that employed by Johnson.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This study {{sought to}} explore, through a case study, {{the notion of the}} Good <b>Language</b> <b>Learner</b> in an attempt to {{identify}} the key prerequisites for effective second language learning. Data were gathered from an interview with a successful, polyglot second <b>language</b> <b>learner</b> with the aim of gaining an understanding of the approaches, strategies and activities he adopted and utilised as an effective <b>language</b> <b>learner.</b> Analysis of the interview data showed that the subject of the case study exhibited many of the characteristics of the hypothetical Good <b>Language</b> <b>Learner</b> identified from a review of relevant literature. The conclusion is that when learners accept responsibility for their language learning and actively engage in language learning activities, they have a much greater chance of success in second language acquisition.
