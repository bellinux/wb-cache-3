5|$|On {{the morning}} of 21 April 1916, the 2nd BCS sailed again for the Skagerrak, this time to support efforts to disrupt the {{transport}} of Swedish ore to Germany. The planned destroyer sweep of the Kattegat was cancelled when word came that the High Seas Fleet was mobilising for an operation of their own (later <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> timed {{to coincide with the}} Irish Easter Rising), and the British ships were ordered to a rendezvous point {{in the middle of the}} North Sea, while the rest of the Grand Fleet made for the south-eastern end of the Long Forties. On the afternoon of 22 April, the Battlecruiser Fleet was patrolling to the north-west of Horn Reefs when heavy fog came down. The ships were zigzagging to avoid submarine attack when Australia collided with sister ship New Zealand twice in three minutes. Australia was damaged badly enough to be put out of action for several months, but New Zealand returned to the fleet on 30 May, a day before the start of the Battle of Jutland, relieving Indefatigable as flagship.|$|E

25|$|Often {{times after}} {{internment}} families {{could not be}} reunited. Many mothers were left with children, but no husband. Furthermore, communities were impossible to rebuild. The lack of community lead to an even more intensified gap between the generations. Children had no one with whom to speak Japanese outside the home {{and as a result}} they rarely learned the language fluently. The lack of community also led to a lack of Japanese foundation and many children lost touch with their culture. Mothers had also <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bolder in their own way and were now taking on wage-earning jobs, which meant that they had less time to teach their children about traditional Japanese culture and traditions.

25|$|The Colorado War (1863–1865) was {{an armed}} {{conflict}} between the United States and a loose alliance among the Kiowa, Comanche, Arapaho, and Cheyenne nations of Native Americans (the last two were particularly closely allied). The war was centered on the Eastern Plains of the Colorado Territory and resulted in the removal of these four Native American peoples from present-day Colorado to present-day Oklahoma. The war included a particularly notorious episode in November 1864 known as the Sand Creek Massacre. The battle, initially hailed by the U.S. press as a great victory, was later <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one of genocidal brutality. The resulting hearings in the United States Congress regarding the malfeasance of the U.S. Army commander, John Chivington, were a watershed in the white views of the Indian Wars {{at the close of}} the American Civil War. In 1868 the U.S. Army, led by George Armstrong Custer, renewed the conflict against the Arapaho and Cheyenne at the Battle of Washita River.|$|E

500|$|In A Game of Thrones, Jon Snow is {{introduced}} as the 14-year-old bastard son of Eddard [...] "Ned" [...] Stark, Lord of Winterfell, and half-brother to Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. Jon {{is described as}} having strong Stark features with a lean build, long face, dark brown hair and grey eyes. Jon has the surname [...] "Snow" [...] (customarily used for illegitimate children in the North) and is resented by Ned's wife Catelyn, who views him as {{a constant reminder of}} Ned's infidelity. Jon is the same age as Robb and enjoys a warm relationship with his siblings, particularly the tomboy Arya (who resembles Jon and like him does not feel like she fits in). Ned treats Jon as much like his other children as propriety and his honor will allow. Still, as somewhat of an outsider, Jon has <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> independent and to fend for himself when necessary. Jon idolizes his father, but is wounded by Ned's refusal to tell him about his mother. At the beginning of the story, Jon adopts the albino direwolf that he names Ghost.

500|$|Nina was {{originally}} written {{as a bad}} girl character, but when the writers rewrote the role for Goodrem, she became a painfully shy school student who was described as being the [...] "quintessential girl-next-door". Nina <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> independent {{from an early age}} as she was travelling with her parents all over the world. She has a complicated relationship with her mother, who she sees as an embarrassment to her. In 2004, her personality underwent a change, and she was no longer shy; she had grown up and had become more assured. Goodrem's manager suggested that Nina should be an aspiring singer and Neighbours developed the character to suit her. Goodrem worked with the writers to incorporate her music into the show. One of Nina's longest running storylines was her relationship with Jack Scully (Jay Bunyan). They began their relationship while they were seeing other people and they break up twice. However, Nina realises that she loves Jack and returns from India to tell him. Goodrem believed Nina and Jack were soulmates. Nina was well received, and Goodrem won the Most Popular New Female Talent Logie Award for the role.|$|E
