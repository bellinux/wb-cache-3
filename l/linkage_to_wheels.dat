The first trains had brakes operative on the locomotive tender and on vehicles in the train, where [...] "porters" [...] or, in the United States brakemen, travelling for the purpose on those vehicles operated the brakes. Some railways fitted a special deep-noted brake whistle to locomotives to indicate to the porters the necessity to apply the brakes.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{outcomes}} of <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> TB and HIV care and identify risk factors for poor referral outcomes. Design: Cohort study of TB patients diagnosed at an urban hospital. Methods: <b>Linkage</b> <b>to</b> care was determined by review of clinic files, national death register, and telephone contact, and classified as linked <b>to</b> care, delayed <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> care (. 7 days for TB treatment,. 30 days for HIV care), or failed <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> care. We performed log-binomial regression to identify patient and referral characteristics associated with poor referral outcomes. Results: Among 593 TB patients, 23 % failed <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> TB treatment and 30. 3 % of the 77. 0 % who linked to care arrived late. Among 486 (86. 9 %) HIV-infected TB patients, 38. 3 % failed <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> HIV care, and 32 % of the 61. 7 % who linked to care presented late. One in six HIV-infected patients failed <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> both TB and HIV care. Only 20. 2 % of HIV-infected patients were referred to a single clinic for integrated care. A referral letter was present in 90. 3 %, but only 23. 7 % included HIV status and 18. 8 % CD 4 cell count. Lack of education (RR 1. 85) and low CD 4 count (CD 4 # 50 vs [...] 250 cells/mm 3; RR 1. 66) were associated with failed <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> TB care. Risk factors for failed <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> HIV care were antiretroviral-naı̈ve status (RR 1. 29), and absence of referral letter with HIV or CD 4 cell count (RR 1. 23).

40|$|Background: In the USA, an {{epidemic}} of opioid overdose deaths is occurring, {{many of which are}} from heroin. Combining naloxone distribution with <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> addiction treatment or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention through syringe service programmes has the potential to save lives and be cost-effective. We estimated the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of five alternative strategies: no additional intervention, naloxone distribution, naloxone distribution plus <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> addiction treatment, naloxone distribution plus PrEP, and naloxone distribution plus <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> addiction treatment and PrEP. Methods: We developed a decision analytical Markov model to simulate opioid overdose, HIV incidence, overdose-related deaths, and HIV-related deaths in people who inject drugs in Connecticut, USA. Model input parameters were derived from published sources. We compared each strategy with no intervention, as well as simultaneously considering all strategies. Sensitivity analysis was done for all variables. <b>Linkage</b> <b>to</b> addiction treatment was referral to an opioid treatment programme for methadone. Endpoints were survival, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), number and percentage of overdose deaths averted, number of HIV-related deaths averted, total costs (in 2015 US$) associated with each strategy, and incremental cost per QALY gained. Findings: In the base-case analysis, compared with no additional intervention, the naloxone distribution strategy yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $ 323 per QALY, and naloxone distribution plus <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> addiction treatment was cost saving compared with no additional intervention (greater effectiveness and less expensive). The most efficient strategies (ie, those conferring the greatest health benefit for a particular budget) were naloxone distribution combined with <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> addiction treatment (cost saving), and naloxone distribution combined with PrEP and <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> addiction treatment (ICER $ 95   337 per QALY) at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $ 100   000. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the combination of naloxone distribution, PrEP, and <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> addiction treatment was the optimal strategy in 37 % of iterations and the combination of naloxone distribution and <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> addiction treatment was the optimal strategy in 34 % of iterations. Interpretation: Naloxone distribution through syringe service programmes is cost-effective compared with syringe distribution alone, but when combined with <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> addiction treatment is cost saving compared with no additional services. A strategy that combines naloxone distribution, PrEP, and <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> addiction treatment results in greater health benefits in people who inject drugs and is also cost-effective.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{identify}} the genetic determinants of psoriasis a genome wide screen (GWS) with microsatellites was performed on a collection of multiplex families. Ten microsatellites were identified that generated evidence of <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> psoriasis susceptibility loci. Support of <b>linkage</b> was observed <b>to</b> markers in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and to markers on chromosomes 2, 8 and 20 in an independent collection of families.;These data indicated that the primary genetic determinant for psoriasis was located in the MHC, a region historically observed {{to be associated with}} psoriasis in case/control studies. Fine mapping of this region has produced strong evidence that the susceptibility locus lies within a 285 kb region defined by HLA-C and the microsatellite TN 62.;The three non-MHC linkages were screened in a large collection of ASP families, although none received additional support of linkage. The families were partitioned upon the basis of allele sharing at the MHC. Those families that exhibited <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> the MHC (TN 3 families) generated evidence of <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> chromosome 20, suggesting an interaction between the susceptibility locus in this interval with the major locus in the MHC. A YAC contig was constructed for this region and two candidate genes were excluded from this interval. Two novel microsatellites were cloned from this contig although neither failed to generate evidence of <b>linkage</b> or association <b>to</b> a susceptibility gene.;A secondary GWS was performed upon a large collection of families, although this failed to generate evidence of <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> any novel susceptibility loci or to provide support for previously identified putative loci, except to markers on the MHC.

40|$|Background HIV {{counselling}} {{and testing}} and <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> care are crucial for successful HIV prevention and treatment. Abbreviated counselling could save time; however, its eff ect on HIV risk is uncertain and methods <b>to</b> improve <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> care {{have not been}} studied. Methods We did this factorial randomised controlled study at Mulago Hospital, Uganda. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} abbreviated or traditional HIV counselling and testing; HIV-infected patients were randomly assigned <b>to</b> enhanced <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> care or standard <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> care. All study personnel except counsellors and the data offi cer were masked to study group assignment. Participants had structured interviews, given once every 3 months. We compared sexual risk behaviour by counselling strategy with a 6 · 5 % non-inferiority margin. We used Cox proportional hazards analyses to compare HIV outcomes by <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> care over 1 year and tested for interaction by sex. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT 00648232). Findings We enrolled 3415 participants; 1707 assigned to abbreviated counselling versus 1708 assigned to traditional. Unprotected sex with an HIV discordant or status unknown partner was similar in each group (232 / 823 [27 · 9 %] vs 251 / 890 [28 · 2 %], diff erence – 0 · 3 %, one-sided 95 % CI 3 · 2).

40|$|Degree Project Thesis, Programme in Medicine. TITLE: <b>Linkage</b> <b>to</b> HIV care after {{discharge}} from an academic hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa. Abstract Background: Over {{the past decade}} the development and large-scale distribution of antiretroviral treatment has posed {{a shift in the}} challenges of the global HIV epidemic. Today, one of the biggest issues in the battle against HIV is to retain eligible patients in lifelong care. Most studies conducted in the area focus on <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> care after arrival to a HIV clinic, while very few studies have been conducted on <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> care after hospital discharge. Aim: To assess the proportion of HIV positive, treatment naive patients that link to HIV care and treatment at a primary health care facility after {{discharge from}} Helen Joseph Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa, and to identify risk factors for failed <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> care. Method: Outcome was determined by review of clinic files and by telephone interviews with patients. Patients were categorized as linked to care (no time cut-off), failed <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> care, lost to follow-up or deceased. Results: Among 62 included patients, 69. 4 % were found to link to HIV care after discharge, while only one (1. 6 %) reported failed <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> care. Mortality and lost to follow-up in the group were both 14. 5 %. Median time between hospital discharge and first visit to a clinic for HIV care was 21 days (IQR 13 - 31. 5). A possible correlation between having TB at discharge and better <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> HIV care was observed. Conclusions: Considering the moderate level of <b>linkage</b> <b>to</b> care and the high mortality found in the study, it is recommended that procedures to ensure counselling and a proper referral for this group of severely ill patients are implemented at Helen Joseph Hospital. If routine follow up of HIV patients is to be conducted in the future, {{there is a need for}} a computerized system at the hospital that can be used in the referral and follow-up proces...|$|R
