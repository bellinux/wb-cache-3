50|$|All non-restricted {{shotguns}} {{must have}} an overall length of at least 660 mm. Semi-automatic shotguns must also have a barrel length of more than 469.9 mm and have a capacity of 5 shells or less in the magazine to remain non-restricted. All other shotgun action types (pump/slide, break open, <b>lever,</b> <b>bolt)</b> {{do not have a}} magazine limit restriction or a minimum barrel length provided the overall length of the firearm remains more than 660 mm and the barrel was produced by an approved manufacturer. Shotgun barrels may only be reduced in length to a minimum of 457 mm. Non-restricted shotguns may be possessed with any Possession and Acquisition Licence (PAL) or Possession-Only License (POL) and may be transported throughout the country without special authorization and may be used for hunting certain species at certain times of the year.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{firearms}} can {{be described}} by their caliber (i.e. their bore diameter; this is given in millimeters or inches e.g. 7.5 mm, [...]357 in.) {{or in the case}} of shotguns their gauge (e.g. 12 ga.); by the type of action employed (muzzle, breech, <b>lever,</b> <b>bolt,</b> pump, revolver, semi-automatic, automatic etc.) together with the usual means of deportment (hand-held or mechanical mounting). Further classification may make reference to the type of barrel used (rifled) and to the barrel length (24 inch), to the firing mechanism (e.g. matchlock, wheellock, flintlock, percussion lock), to the design's primary intended use (e.g. hunting rifle), or to the commonly accepted name for a particular variation (e.g. Gatling gun). The word firearms usually is used in a sense restricted to small arms (weapons that can be carried by a single person), whereas the word artillery covers larger gunpowder-fired weapons.|$|E
50|$|Regular clutch hand Shifter - This {{is where}} the shifter is a regular knob either located on the tank, which {{operates}} through a linkage to the transmission (tank shifter) or on a <b>lever</b> <b>bolted</b> directly {{to the top of}} the transmission (jockey shifter or slap shifter depending on the transmission design) and involves the semi-complex task of foot clutch operation and hand shifting. The foot is used to operate the clutch pedal clutch lever and the second hand is used to shift gears.|$|R
5000|$|Gallery Rifle Small Bore (GRSB). Most {{competitors}} use a {{semi automatic}} (self loading) rifle chambered in [...]22 Long Rifle. In some events, however, {{it is possible}} to use pump action, <b>lever</b> action, <b>bolt</b> action or even single shot rifles.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The notches {{in the key}} {{align with}} the obstructions, or wards, {{allowing}} it to rotate freely. In rotating, the key may then activate a <b>lever</b> or sliding <b>bolt</b> to open the lock.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 336 is {{designed}} to be easily disassembled for cleaning. Removal of the lever pivot screw with a flathead screwdriver, allows field stripping of the <b>lever</b> arm, <b>bolt,</b> and ejector for maintenance. [...] Unlike many lever action designs, the Model 336 can be cleaned from the breech, much like a bolt-action rifle. [...] This in turn avoids damage to the muzzle caused by cleaning rods and tools.|$|R
5000|$|The {{operating}} {{principle of the}} straight pull bolt action comprises a bolt [...] "sleeve" [...] to which the <b>bolt</b> <b>lever</b> or handle is attached. The sleeve is hollow and has spiral grooves or [...] "teeth" [...] cut into its inner surface in which slide corresponding projections or [...] "teeth" [...] {{on the outside of}} the bolt head or [...] "body". As the <b>bolt</b> <b>lever</b> and sleeve are moved, the bolt head is forced to rotate through about 90°, locking or unlocking it in the receiver of the rifle. The bolt handle and sleeve thus need only be pushed backwards or forwards to open or close the action of the rifle.|$|R
50|$|The BLR uses a {{detachable}} box magazine. Because of this, the BLR can be chambered for rounds with pointed tip bullets {{that would}} be inappropriate for the tubular magazines more commonly used in lever-action rifles. Another difference is the geared <b>lever</b> and <b>bolt</b> design that can accommodate high-pressure modern magnum rounds. Another notable feature is that the trigger moves with the lever when it is operated, which prevents the shooter's trigger finger from being pinched between the lever and the stock when the lever is closed.|$|R
25|$|The CPW weighs only 1.5kg empty/dry (2kg with a {{fully loaded}} 30-round 9mm magazine) {{and uses a}} unique <b>bolt</b> <b>lever</b> cam recoil {{mitigation}} system to control recoil and muzzle rise to increase target hits. Full-auto cyclic rate of fire is a relatively high 900 to 1100rpm.|$|R
50|$|Another {{characteristic}} that differs RT-20 from other heavy sniper rifles {{is that both}} optics and <b>bolt</b> <b>lever</b> are positioned {{on the left side}} of the rifle itself.It is also important to note that the maximum effective range of the RT-20 depends on the nature of the target.|$|R

Full-auto cyclic rate of fire is a relatively high 900 to 1100 rpm.|$|R
50|$|In locksmithing, a bolt stump is a {{rectangular}} {{part of a}} lock located above the talon, and passes through the slot in the <b>levers</b> as the <b>bolt</b> moves. This part is welded or riveted onto the lathe in some earlier locks. Modern lock manufacture allows this to be machined in. Most are directly cast into the blank and then milled smooth for final use.|$|R
50|$|A three-position, {{firing pin}} {{blocking}} safety <b>lever</b> on the <b>bolt</b> shroud allows the bolt to be manipulated with the safety on. If the weapon is cocked, {{the firing pin}} can be felt {{at the end of}} the bolt action, making it possible in poor visibility to feel whether the weapon is ready to fire. The safety-catch of the weapon is also positioned at the rear, showing white if the safety is on, red if not.|$|R
50|$|Rounds of {{the same}} caliber but with different-shaped meplats {{sometimes}} cannot be loaded into the same firearm. The meplat {{plays an important role}} in the loading of weapons whose ammunition is guided into the chamber by a mechanism (e.g., auto-loading, <b>lever</b> action or <b>bolt</b> action), though this usually is not important in weapons whose rounds are chambered by hand (e.g., single shots, double rifles, drillings and revolvers) rather than by a mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Trains from Hereford {{passed a}} fixed Distant signal (a yellow semaphore) that was bolted, unable to move, to its signal post. This {{protected}} the junction from the branch from Gloucester, Newent and Dymock as this informed drivers to always approach this junction at Ledbury cautiously. When this junction {{was removed from}} this track in 1948, this signal now needed {{to be capable of}} being operated from the signalbox and a new signal and lever were fitted, with no spare space on the frame the new signal <b>lever</b> was <b>bolted</b> onto the outside or the frame, to the left of L1 [...] lever and given the designation [...] "0". As the signal is a yellow distant signal, so the lever is painted yellow. In 1956, a colour-light signal replaced the semaphore arm and this remains today.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} type of lock used in England and Ireland. It is of a {{basic design}} originally {{of a very}} stiff <b>lever</b> and a <b>bolt</b> with wards being the block. As wards were outdated in {{the centre of the}} key, it became normal for them to be placed {{on the sides of the}} bit. Although today these are still produced they are mostly for internal doors and are not used for high security. Older locks could be as large as 40 cm by 25 cm.Most rimlocks used today on exterior doors in the British Isles are nightlatches.|$|R
25|$|The {{addition}} of a bolt accelerator to the Lahti pistol was to ensure {{the performance of the}} pistol in arctic conditions in Finland. Bolt accelerators are more commonly found in machine guns to increase the rate of fire. The bolt accelerator in the Lahti works by having a crank <b>lever</b> strike the <b>bolt</b> of the pistol as it unlocks from firing. This thrusts the bolt mechanically instead of relying on the momentum of firing alone to move the bolt back. The value of the {{addition of}} the bolt accelerator was put into question with a batch of guns made without an accelerator being produced. The immediate recall of the pistols without bolt accelerators is thought to indicate the accelerator is not essential but useful in the operation of the gun.|$|R
50|$|Lever-delayed {{blowback}} utilizes {{leverage to}} delay {{the opening of the}} breech. When the cartridge pushes against the <b>bolt</b> face, the <b>lever</b> moves the <b>bolt</b> carrier rearward at an accelerated rate relative to the light bolt. Leverage can be applied with a dedicated part or through inclined surfaces interacting with each other. This leverage significantly increases resistance and slows the movement of the lightweight bolt. John Pedersen patented the first known design for a lever-delay system. The mechanism was adapted by Hungarian arms designer Pál Király in the 1930s and used in the Danuvia 43M. Other weapons to use this system are the Hogue Avenger and Benelli B76 pistols, the Cristóbal Carbine, the TKB-517 and FAMAS assault rifles, the AVB-7.62 battle rifle, the FNAB-43 submachine gun, and the Sterling 7.62 and AA-52 machine guns.|$|R
50|$|In the Mauser-style turn-bolt action, {{the bolt}} handle must be rotated counter-{{clockwise}}, drawn rearward, pushed forward, and finally rotated clockwise back into lock. In a straight-pull action, the <b>bolt</b> <b>lever</b> can be cycled without rotating it, hence producing a reduced {{range of motion}} by the shooter from four movements to two, {{with the goal of}} increasing the rifle's rate of fire. The Ross and Schmidt-Rubin rifles load via stripper clips, albeit of an unusual paperboard and steel design in the Schmidt-Rubin rifle, while the Mannlicher uses en-bloc clips. The Schmidt-Rubin series, which culminated in the K31, are also known for being among the most accurate military rifles ever made. Yet another variant of the straight-pull bolt action, of which the M1895 Lee Navy is an example, is a camming action in which pulling the bolt handle causes the bolt to rock, freeing a stud from the receiver and unlocking the bolt.|$|R
50|$|The FNAB-43 uses a lever-delayed {{blowback}} system firing from the closed bolt position. The bolt is a two-piece unit with a pivoted <b>lever</b> interposed between <b>bolt</b> head and body. On firing the bolt head retracts {{and begins to}} rotate the lever, the base of which is against a lug in the body. This lever is pivoted to delay the opening movement to allow the bullet to leave the barrel. The breech pressure then drops before the lever has completed its rotation. The movement of the lever then presses the free end against the bolt body and accelerates the bolt's movement to the rear. The base of the lever then pulls clear of the lug and the whole bolt unit continues to recoil as one piece. On returning, the lever again engages the lug and pivots forward {{and in doing so}} removes a coupling which allows the firing pin to move only when the bolt is fully forward. This unusual and complicated system allows the rate of fire to be kept down to very practical 400 rpms without having to use a heavy bolt or strong spring.|$|R
50|$|The bolt {{closes the}} breech {{end of the}} barrel and {{contains}} the firing pin. The bolt is held in place with a lever that fits into a notch. Moving this lever out of the notch will release the restraint on the bolt, allowing it to be drawn back. An extractor removes the spent cartridge, which is then ejected through the lever slot. A spring {{at the bottom of}} the magazine pushes up the reserve rounds, positioning the topmost between the bolt and the chamber at the base of the barrel. Pushing the <b>bolt</b> <b>lever</b> forward chambers this round and pushing the lever into the notch locks the bolt and enables the trigger mechanism. The complete cycle action also resets the firing pin. The Mauser rifle of the late 19th and early 20th centuries is the most famous of the bolt action types, with most similar weapons derived from this pioneering design, such as the M1903 Springfield and the Karabiner 98 Kurz rifle (abbreviated often as Kar98k or simply K98). The Russian Mosin-Nagant rifle, the British Lee-Enfield, and the Norwegian Krag-Jørgensen are examples of alternate bolt-action designs.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{drill and}} working of these guns is magnificent. Nearly [...] {{everything}} in the fore-turret is worked by steam and hydraulic power, [...] so that comparatively few men are required to move the iron monsters. [...] Let {{me ask you to}} imagine the men at their stations. Some are inside [...] the turret, and as guns and turret move in concert the men inside move [...] with them. Those outside the turret stand at its base, and are [...] therefore below the iron deck and protected by the iron sides of the [...] ship. The insiders revolve, aim, and fire the gun; the outsiders [...] load. The first lieutenant, standing {{at the base of the}} tower, close [...] to the hole by which it is entered, so that he may be heard by both [...] out and insiders, shouts, `Close up,' in the voice of a Stentor. At [...] this some men grasp levers, others stand by wheels which let on [...] respectively hydraulic power and steam. The captain of the tower, [...] seated on an elevated position, puts his head through a man-hole in [...] the roof of the turret, which hole is covered with a bullet-proof iron [...] hood, having a narrow opening in front. He surveys the supposed [...] enemy, and his duty is to revolve the tower, take aim, and let go the [...] firing machinery, i.e. pull the trigger. The outsiders stand by the [...] locking <b>bolt,</b> <b>levers,</b> shot-racks, etcetera. Then, in the attitude of [...] ready-for-action, all become motionless attentive statues--a regular [...] tableau-vivant.|$|R
