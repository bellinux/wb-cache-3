50|$|Wheat yellow leaf virus (WYLV) is a wheat (Triticum spp. L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), rye (Secale cereale M.Bieb.), and oat (Avena sativa L.) {{pathogenic}} virus of {{the family}} Closteroviridae. WYLV virions are 1600-1850 nm in length and 10 nm in diameter. The virus, like other members of its genus, is transmitted by aphids. Identified vectors include Rhopalosiphum padi L. and R. maidis Fitch. (Aphididae). The virus has been identified in crop plants in Japan, China, and Italy. Native host plants include Italian ryegrass (<b>Lolium</b> <b>multiflorum</b> <b>Lam.)</b> in Europe and Agropyron tsukushiense var. transiens Ohwi in Japan. The virus proliferates in the phloem of its host plants, interfering with the plant's ability to produce sufficient chlorophyll (Chlorosis), causing the leaves to yellow and the plant to die.|$|E

In California, resistance to glyphosate has become increasingly common. To identify the mechanisms conferring glyphosate resistance in California populations of L. perenne and to gain insights into the evolutionary origins and spread of resistance in the region, we investigated the frequency of target-site mutations conferring resistance to glyphosate combined with the frequency of resistant individuals in 14 populations. A region of 5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase (EPSPS) was sequenced in 401 individuals to assay for target site mutations. Seven unique alleles were detected at codon site 106, four {{of which have been}} previously shown to confer target-site-based resistance to glyphosate. Four different resistance alleles were detected, indicating that resistance to glyphosate has evolved multiple times in the region. In two populations, no EPSPS mutations were detected despite the presence of resistant plants, strongly suggesting that non-target-site-based mechanisms confer resistance to glyphosate in these populations. It is likely that resistance to glyphosate in these 14 California populations of L. perenne derives from at least five evolutionary origins, indicating that adaptive traits can evolve repeatedly over agricultural landscapes...|$|R

In order to calculate concentration ratios (CRs; the concentration of an element in a plant {{in relation to the}} concentration in the soil), soils from the experiments were also analysed to calculate extractable concentrations of Cs and Sr. To test if cultivars have consistently low Cs and Sr concentration ratios, 17 hybrid ryegrass cultivars were sampled from both sites again in summer 2013 and spring and summer 2014. Tall fescue cultivars had lower Cs and Sr CRs than the other species. Three of the selected 17 hybrid ryegrass cultivars had consistently low Cs CRs, two had consistently low Sr CRs and one had consistently low Cs and Sr CRs.
