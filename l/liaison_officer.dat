5|$|In May 1942, Đurišić {{attacked}} and defeated the last significant Partisan detachment in Montenegro. In June 1942, Đurišić {{collaborated with the}} Ustaše in Foča in south-eastern Bosnia. After being forced out of Serbia by the Germans, Mihailović arrived in Montenegro as the Italians and Chetniks were fighting the Partisans. Mihailović was accompanied by his staff and a British Special Operations Executive (SOE) <b>liaison</b> <b>officer.</b> He eventually established his base {{in the village of}} Gornje Lipovo, a few miles from Đurišić's headquarters at Kolašin. Mihailović and his staff had few troops and relied on Đurišić for protection. Soon after Mihailović arrived in Montenegro, Đurišić told Mihailović's SOE <b>liaison</b> <b>officer</b> that he was available to act independently and in defiance of Mihailović. Đurišić and the other Chetnik commanders in Montenegro nominally recognised Mihailović as their supreme commander but they rarely obeyed him.|$|E

The findings show that national interests of Member States remain paramount in posting <b>liaison</b> <b>officers.</b> Practices of <b>liaison</b> <b>officers</b> are largely governed by national regulations and organisational particulars, but also depend on the high level of discretion that <b>liaison</b> <b>officers</b> can exercise. In contrast, the policy instruments are largely driven by a political rationality and little intended effect of these instruments can be detected...|$|R

40|$|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, {{transgender}} and intersex (LGBTI) police liaison {{programs were}} established in Australia from the late 1980 s onwards to ameliorate the historically problematic relationship between LGBTI people and police. Police <b>liaison</b> <b>officers</b> are trained in LGBTI issues and typically available to support LGBTI victims, offenders and even witnesses. Interestingly, although there is considerable awareness of these services among LGBTI people, very few LGBTI people seek support from these officers (Berman & Robinson 2010). This paper outlines {{the results of an}} analysis of interview data exploring why LGBTI people do not seek support from LGBTI police <b>liaison</b> <b>officers</b> in three Australian states (Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia).
