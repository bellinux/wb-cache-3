2500|$|It's {{pretty hard}} {{to say on the}} one hand that we feel very {{strongly}} about Pakistani and Indian nuclear testing {{and on the other hand}} the U.S. Senate won't ratify the ...treaty... The <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> United States wants to see is a resumption of nuclear testing or the proliferation of nuclear weapons – and it is the last thing Australia wants to see. By refusing to ratify this treaty, the United States Senate has done a lot to undermine the arms control agenda that the international community, including Australia, has been working on.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} {{at this time that}} the local press gave Tijerina the {{nickname}} of Don Quixote, belittling his quest to restore the property rights of land grant heirs. [...] By 1964 the Alianza had over 6,000 members; a year later, its membership had increased to 14,000. [...] At its 1966 convention, the Alianza counted 20,000 people in its fold. Nevertheless, the Alianza's activities raised the ire of many influential and powerful New Mexican Hispanics, who saw Tijerina as an outsider who had come to upset the status quo. For example, U.S. Senator Joseph Montoya, spoke out against Tijerina and the Alianza, stating that [...] "the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> Spanish-speaking need is agitation, rabble-rousing, or creation of false hopes," [...] and characterized Tijerina as an [...] "outsider who sparked violence and set back racial relations and an enemy of the United States." ...|$|E
2500|$|At bar 65 {{the first}} violins hit middle C, {{and when they}} do they cease playing the A minor scale and simply play C {{continuously}} {{until the end of the}} piece (i.e., for more than 250 beats). Eleven bars later the second violins hit a low A and play that continuously. Similarly the other voices gradually find the note that they have been seeking and once reached, they play it continuously until the end. The last to lock into place are the contrabasses which alight on a low A in bar 103. At this stage the whole ensemble is playing an A minor chord very very loudly, and this continues for five bars, then on the second beat of the last bar they suddenly stop. At that moment the bell is struck very quietly (pianissimo) so that the striking itself is not heard, but only the reverberations as it dies away. [...] As the final bell toll reverberates, with all other instruments silent, the overtones of the bell become prominently audible – in particular, the fourth overtone (fifth partial), which is the note C-sharp, i.e., the major third of the fundamental pitch (A) of the entire piece. [...] This creates a striking effect, as the entire piece is set in the key of A minor, so that in the dying echoes of the final bell, the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> listener hears is actually an A major chord contained within the overtones of the bell. [...] This evokes the common Renaissance and Baroque technique called the [...] "Picardy third", in which a piece set in a minor mode or key nonetheless ends on a major chord, evoking a ray of light piercing through the clouds, and suggesting hope, resurrection, or redemption. [...] Here, however, the effect is subtle, because it arises solely from the overtones of a single strike of the bell, rather than from separate instruments or voices.|$|E

6000|$|All borrowers are bad; but in this, as {{in other}} crimes, there are degrees. The man who acts as Menage advises, in the aphorism which Garrick used as a motto on his bookplate, the man who reads a book {{instantly}} and promptly returns it, is the most pardonable borrower. But how few people do this! As a rule, the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> borrower thinks of is {{to read the book}} which he has secured. Or rather, that is the last thing but one; the very last idea that enters his mind is the project of returning the volume. It simply [...] "lies about," [...] and gets dusty in his rooms. A very bad borrower is he who makes pencil marks on books. Perhaps he is a little more excusable than the borrower who does not read at all.|$|E
60|$|A {{man who had}} {{appeared}} without a sound stood in the white road, his rigid figure forced up sharp and black against it, and {{it was evident that}} he was peering about him. Then, with a swiftness that had its significance, he slipped back into the shadow, and moved through it, stopping a second or two now and then as though to listen. Appleby could just see him, and felt a little shiver run through him, for he knew the loyalist scout was running a horrible risk. He hoped the man would see nothing, for the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> Sin Verguenza desired was to chance a rifle shot just then. He, however, came on, treading softly and stooping as though to observe the dew‐clogged dust, until he stopped again where a little pathway led in among the aloes.|$|E
60|$|At first Lord Carteret {{considered}} it a thousand pities {{that they should not}} have contrived matters better so as to take Sir Richard alive; but upon reflection he was careful not to exaggerate to himself the loss occasioned by his death, for Sir Richard, after all, was a notoriously stubborn man, not in the least likely to have made any avowals worth having. So that his trial, whilst probably resulting sterile of such results as the government could desire, would have given publicity to the matter of a plot that was hatching; and such publicity at a time of so much unrest was the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> government desired. Where Jacobitism was concerned, Lord Carteret had the wise discretion to proceed with the extremest caution. Publicity might serve to fan the smouldering embers into a blaze, whereas it was his cunning aim quietly to stifle them as he came upon them.|$|E

60|$|This was {{absolutely}} the <b>last</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>the</b> last ceremony of an imperative rite. I was abandoned to myself {{now and it}} was terrible. Generally I used to go out, {{walk down to the}} port, {{take a look at the}} craft I loved with a sentiment that was extremely complex, being mixed up with the image of a woman; perhaps go on board, not because there was anything for me to do there but just for nothing, for happiness, simply as a man will sit contented in the companionship of the beloved object. For lunch I had the choice of two places, one Bohemian, the other select, even aristocratic, where I had still my reserved table in the petit salon, up the white staircase. In both places I had friends who treated my erratic appearances with discretion, in one case tinged with respect, in the other with a certain amused tolerance. I owed this tolerance to the most careless, the most confirmed of those Bohemians (his beard had streaks of grey amongst its many other tints) who, once bringing his heavy hand down on my shoulder, took my defence against the charge of being disloyal and even foreign to that milieu of earnest visions taking beautiful and revolutionary shapes in the smoke of pipes, in the jingle of glasses.|$|E
