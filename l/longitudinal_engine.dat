25|$|Although American Motors' Eagle Premier (and Dodge Monaco) was {{discontinued}} by Chrysler {{after the}} 1992 model year, the new Concorde's packaging {{was derived from}} the Premier, and all the suspension and drivetrain development mules were Premiers. Other design features found their way into the Chrysler LH platform, most notably the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>engine</b> layout, a hallmark of Renault's front-wheel-drive designs. This design allowed Chrysler to lower the hoodline, made maintenance/servicing simpler, and tightened the car's turning diameter.|$|E
25|$|The {{front-wheel drive}} Medallion used the 2.2L I4 engine that also powered the European Renault 25. It was mounted in a {{longitudinal}} (front-back) configuration, driving {{the front wheels}} through either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 3-speed computer-controlled automatic. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>engine</b> placement is unusual for a front-wheel drive car, as the transverse engine layout is typically more space-efficient. It {{was one of a}} few cars with this layout, which helps reduce torque steering. The gearbox is centrally mounted resulting in equal-length axle shafts. In Europe, Renault 21 versions with engine displacements below 2L had transverse engines, just like smaller models such as the Renault 9. Higher-end R 21 versions with engines of 2L or more, retained the longitudinal layout of the previous Renault 20 and 30 series. The longitudinally mounted versions had a shorter wheelbase than the European transverse versions. Product plans also called for a four-wheel drive Medallion to be imported in late-1988.|$|E
2500|$|The Premier's <b>longitudinal</b> <b>engine</b> {{mounting}} layout was inherited, as was {{the front}} suspension geometry, {{and parts of the}} braking system. The chassis itself became a flexible architecture capable of supporting front or rear-wheel drive (designated [...] "LH" [...] and [...] "LX" [...] respectively). The transmission was inspired by the Premier's Audi and ZF automatics. Borrowing heavily from Chrysler's A604 (41TE) [...] "Ultradrive" [...] transversely mounted automatic, it became the A606 (also known as 42LE).|$|E
5000|$|This type {{of motor}} is usually used for rear-wheel drive cars, {{except for some}} Audi and SAAB models {{equipped}} with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>engines</b> in front wheel drive. In front-wheel drive cars a transverse engine is usually used. Trucks often have <b>longitudinal</b> <b>engines</b> with rear-wheel drive.|$|R

2500|$|Crossover (or CUV): A loose {{marketing}} term {{to describe}} a vehicle that blends features of a SUV with features of a car — especially forgoing the body on frame construction of the SUV {{in favor of the}} [...] car's unibody or monocoque construction. Crossovers usually borrow drivetrains and other parts from traditional cars in the same manufacturer's line. Crossovers typically employ an FF layout or an FF-based four-wheel drive layout with a transverse engine, rather than an FR layout or an FR-based 4WD layout with a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>engine</b> as is typically used on traditional truck-based SUVs.|$|E

50|$|Increased engine {{performance}} is a consideration, but also other features associated with luxury vehicles. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>engines</b> are common.

50|$|All Audi {{cars with}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>engines</b> and their 'trademark' quattro four-wheel drive (4WD) system, {{along with their}} related marques from the Volkswagen Group which share the same layout, utilise a transaxle. This is mounted {{immediately}} behind the front-mounted engine (again, longitudinally) and contains the 'gearbox' (manual, automatic, DSG, or CVT), along with both the centre differential, and the front differential and final drive unit.|$|R
50|$|But the {{original}} ancestor was the AR4 transmission, deployed on Renault vehicles with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>engines</b> (4 and 6 cylinders) in the 1980s : R25, R21 and Espace. Two different versions for transverse engines {{were developed in}} the early 1990s : AD4 for 4 cylinders (Renault Clio, Mégane, Laguna, Safrane) and AD8 for 6 cylinders (Renault Laguna, Safrane). Both 096 and 01M VW transmissions {{are similar to the}} AD4, and many parts are interchangeable.|$|R
50|$|The Jatco 3N71 {{transmission}} was {{the first}} 3-speed automatic transmission from Nissan. It was an introduced as a conventional alternative to the then-ubiquitous and popular Borg-Warner Type 35. It was designed for use with rear wheel drive vehicles with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>engines.</b> In 1982, it gained a locking torque converter (L3N71b) for greater efficiency, and gained an overdrive section in 1983 (L4N71b), culminating with preliminary electronic sensors and control functions being added in 1985 (E4N71b).|$|R

5000|$|Many mid- and rear-engined {{vehicles}} use a {{transverse engine}} and transaxle, {{similar to a}} front wheel drive unit. Others use a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>engine</b> and transaxle like Ferrari's 1989 Mondial t which used a [...] "t" [...] arrangement with a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>engine</b> connected to a transverse transaxle, a design the company continues to this day. Front-wheel drive versions of modern Audis, from the A4 upwards, along with their related marques from the Volkswagen Group (which share the same automobile layout) also use a similar layout, but with the transaxle also mounted longitudinally.|$|E

50|$|The 42LE was an {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} 41TE modified for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>engines.</b> It debuted in 1993 on the LH cars. It is strengthened with a reworked final drive unit, barreled axle shafts, and upgraded clutch packs. The major modification to a N-S drivetrain while maintaining front wheel drive was accomplished by adding a differential to the transmission case, which was driven {{by means of a}} transfer chain from the output shaft of the low/reverse clutch assembly {{at the rear of the}} transmission case.|$|R

50|$|Front mounted <b>longitudinal</b> <b>engines</b> with {{rear-wheel drive}} (FR) {{is a common}} layout of luxury cars. European marques like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Jaguar have almost never adopted front mounted engines with front-wheel drive (FF) and {{retained}} a lineup mostly or entirely made up of FR cars. Japanese brands such as Lexus and Infiniti also have predominantly FR lineups. The FR layout, while {{more expensive than the}} FF, has been retained by these luxury manufacturers as it allows for higher performance engines (particularly the straight-6, V8, and other engine configurations with more cylinders), better handling, and a smoother ride.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to the use}} of strut front suspension, the Fox {{platform}} {{was designed}} with a wider engine bay than its Falcon-chassis predecessor. As a result, the chassis was flexible in its use of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>engines,</b> accommodating a wide variety of powertrains, including four-cylinder (naturally-aspirated and turbocharged), inline-6, V6, and V8 engines, ranging from a 2.3L inline-4 to a 5.8L V8 (the most powerful Fox-platform car is the 2003-2004 Mustang SVT Cobra with a 390 hp supercharged 4.6L V8). To further improve the fuel economy of Lincoln Fox-platform vehicles in the 1980s, the platform was adapted for the use of BMW diesel inline-6 engines.|$|R
50|$|The 1294 cc {{iteration}} {{was introduced}} in 1971, replacing the earlier 1204 cc unit used. The bore was increased to 76.7 mm, while the stroke remained 70.0 mm. The engine code was 366 for transversal installations, while <b>longitudinal</b> <b>engines</b> were called type 371. In 1973, Simca changed their system and the engines became 3G (transversal) and 1G (longitudinal) instead. After PSA began to closer combine their operations {{with those of the}} erstwhile Simca corporation, the engine code was changed yet again, to G1A, for use in the 309 and late Horizons. The 1978 only Simca 1000 Rallye III had the most potent unit yet, the 1G4C.|$|R
