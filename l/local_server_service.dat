40|$|Abstract—Distributed servers {{architecture}} offers {{storage and}} streaming scalabilities for video services. In this letter, we propose and analyze an on-demand scheme {{in which the}} <b>local</b> <b>servers</b> store the beginning portion (i. e., the “prefix”) of videos and deliver it by means of unicast streams to the clients. The clients are able to merge onto on-going multicast streams delivered from the repository by means of their set-top buffers. Given a certain limited repository (and thereof multicast) bandwidth, we investigate how {{the total cost of}} the <b>local</b> <b>servers</b> can be minimized. We show that if the local storage is the main cost, the size of the prefixes is likely to increase with the video popularity. On the other hand, if the server cost mainly comes from streaming capacity, the size of the prefixes is likely to decrease asymptotically with the video popularity.

40|$|In an on-demand video system, {{a number}} of {{repository}} servers store all the video contents of interest to a large pool of geographically distributed users. In order to achieve higher streaming capacity and lower long-haul transmission cost, a distributed servers architecture can be used, in which multiple <b>local</b> <b>servers</b> are placed close to the users and cache the video contents dynamically according to their local demands. We consider in this paper that the repository delivers video contents to the <b>local</b> <b>servers</b> using multicasting. Upon {{the arrival of a}} request the <b>local</b> <b>server</b> joins the on-going multicast streams of the movie and caches the data (i. e., "latches" onto the streams), while a transient network stream is allocated to supply the missing (beginning) portion of the movie due to the time-lag between the request and the multicast streams. After a short while, all the streams will "merge" into one stream. Such scheme is hence called "latching and merging. " We study the required nu [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In an on-demand video system, {{the video}} {{repository}} generally has limited streaming capacities {{and may be}} far from the users. In order to achieve higher user capacity and lower network transmission cost, distributed servers architecture can be used, in which multiple <b>local</b> <b>servers</b> are placed close to user pools and, according to their local demands, dynamically cache the contents streamed from the repository. We study in this paper a number of caching schemes as applied in the <b>local</b> <b>servers</b> {{depending on whether the}} repository is able to multicast movie contents to the <b>local</b> <b>servers</b> or not, and whether the <b>local</b> <b>servers</b> can exchange their cached contents among themselves or not. Our caching schemes keep a circular buffer of data for the movie requested, and hence movies are partially cached. By adjusting the size of the buffer, such caching is able to achieve better tradeoff between network channels and local storage as compared to the traditional caching in which a movie is treated as an entity. For each caching scheme, we study the tradeoff between the local storage and the network channels, and address how the total cost of the system can be minimized by appropriately sizing the buffer. As compared to a number of traditional operations (request batching and multicasting, true-VOD, etc.), we show that distributed servers architecture is able to achieve much lower system cost to offer on-demand video services...|$|R
