GnRH analogues work by initially over stimulating the pituitary then rapidly desensitizing it to the effects of GnRH. Over a period of weeks, gonadal androgen production is greatly reduced. There is considerable controversy over the earliest age, and for how long it is clinically, morally and legally safe to do this. The Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association Standards of Care permit from Tanner Stage 2, but do not allow the addition of gender-appropriate hormones until 16, which could be five or more years. The sex steroids do have important other functions. The high cost of GnRH analogues is often a significant factor.|$|E

50|$|In a phase II {{clinical}} trial of 1000 mg/day and 2000 mg/day GTx-758 versus <b>leuprorelin</b> {{for the treatment}} of prostate cancer, GTx-758 suppressed total testosterone levels to a lower extent than <b>leuprorelin</b> but decreased free testosterone and PSA levels to a greater extent, suggesting superior effectiveness. GTx-758 increased median SHBG levels by 495% (at 1000 mg/day) and 583% (at 2000 mg/day), which was considered to account for the greater relative decrease in levels of free testosterone. There was a significantly lesser incidence of estrogen deficiency-associated side effects in the GTx-758 group. For instance, there was a more than 4-fold lower incidence of hot flashes for GTx-758, C-terminal telopeptide (CTX) and bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) levels (markers of bone turnover) increased in the <b>leuprorelin</b> group but decreased in the GTx-758 group (indicating a beneficial bone-sparing effect for GTx-758), and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels (which are positively associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome as well as progression of prostate cancer) increased in the <b>leuprorelin</b> group but decreased in the GTx-758 group. Incidence of gynecomastia was not reported with GTx-758. However, a higher incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) was observed with GTx-78 (4.1%) relative to <b>leuprorelin</b> (0.0%), and this led to early termination of the {{clinical trial}}. The drug was said to be well-tolerated aside from VTE. Studies are underway with lower doses of GTx-758 as secondary hormonal therapy in prostate cancer to see if such doses minimize the incidence of VTE.|$|E

5000|$|A 2005 paper {{suggested}} <b>leuprorelin</b> as {{a possible}} treatment for autism, the hypothetical method of action being the now defunct hypothesis that autism is caused by mercury, with the additional unfounded assumption that mercury binds irreversibly to testosterone and therefore <b>leuprorelin</b> can help cure autism by lowering the testosterone levels and thereby mercury levels. However there is no scientifically valid or reliable research to show its effectiveness in treating autism. This use has been termed the [...] "Lupron protocol" [...] and Mark Geier, the proponent of the hypothesis, has frequently been barred from testifying in vaccine-autism related cases {{on the grounds of}} not being sufficiently expert in that particular issue and has had his medical license revoked. [...] Medical experts have referred to Geier's claims as [...] "junk science".|$|E
50|$|In 2001, the US Department of Justice, states {{attorneys}} general, and TAP Pharmaceutical Products settled {{criminal and}} civil charges against TAP related to federal and state medicare fraud and illegal marketing of the drug <b>leuprorelin.</b> TAP paid a total of $875 million, which was a record high at the time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leuprorelin</b> is marketed by Bayer AG {{under the}} brand name Viadur, by Tolmar under {{the brand name}} Eligard, and by TAP Pharmaceuticals (1985-2008), by Varian Darou Pajooh under the brand name Leupromer and Abbott Laboratories (2008-current) under the brand name Lupron. It is {{available}} as a slow-release implant or subcutaneous/intramuscular injection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leuprorelin</b> {{acts as an}} agonist at {{pituitary}} GnRH receptors. By interrupting {{the normal}} pulsatile stimulation of, and thus desensitizing, the GnRH receptors, it indirectly downregulates the secretion of gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to hypogonadism and thus a dramatic reduction in estradiol and testosterone levels in both sexes.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, a {{subcutaneous}} implant, or subcutaneous pellet, is an implant that is surgically delivered {{under the}} skin into the subcutaneous tissue and is used to deliver a drug {{for a long period}} of time. Examples of drugs that can be administered in this way include <b>leuprorelin</b> and the sex steroids estradiol and testosterone.|$|E
5000|$|Antigonadotropins: {{drugs that}} {{suppress}} the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced release of gonadotropins and consequent activation of gonadal androgen production. Examples include GnRH analogues like <b>leuprorelin</b> and cetrorelix, progestogens like chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, osaterone acetate (veterinary), and oxendolone, and estrogens like estradiol, estradiol esters, ethinylestradiol, conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin), diethylstilbestrol, and bifluranol.|$|E
50|$|The {{injections}} are <b>leuprorelin</b> made intramuscularly by {{a health}} professional. The patient may need it monthly (Lupron Depot, Lupron Depot-PED) or each 3, 4 or 6 months (Lupron Depot-3 month, Lupron Depot-PED-3 month, Lupron Depot-4 month, Lupron Depot-6 Month). Depot Lupron can cost from $700 to $1,500 a month {{depending on the}} country where it is practiced.|$|E
5000|$|Suppression of {{spontaneous}} ovulation {{as part of}} controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, which is an essential component in in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Typically, after GnRH agonists have induced a state of hypoestrogenism, exogenous FSH is given to stimulate ovarian follicle, followed by human chorionic gonadotropins (hCG) to trigger oocyte release. GnRH agonists routinely {{used for this purpose}} are: buserelin, <b>leuprorelin,</b> nafarelin, and triptorelin.|$|E
5000|$|Castration {{consists}} of either medical castration with a [...] analogue or surgical castration via orchiectomy. [...] analogues include [...] agonists like <b>leuprorelin</b> or goserelin and [...] antagonists like cetrorelix. They are powerful antigonadotropins and work by abolishing the -induced secretion of gonadotropins, in turn ceasing gonadal production of sex hormones. Medical and surgical castration achieve {{essentially the same}} effect, decreasing circulating testosterone levels by approximately 95%.|$|E
50|$|Examples of GnRH {{agonists}} include <b>leuprorelin</b> (leuprolide) and goserelin, {{while an}} example of a GnRH antagonist is cetrorelix. Estrogens that are or that have been used as antigonadotropins include estradiol, estradiol esters like estradiol valerate, estradiol undecylate, and polyestradiol phosphate, conjugated equine estrogens, ethinylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol (no longer widely used), and bifluranol. Progestogens that are used as antigonadotropins include chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and oxendolone.|$|E
5000|$|TAP Pharmaceuticals {{was formed}} in 1977 as {{a joint venture between}} the two global {{pharmaceutical}} companies, Abbott Laboratories and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. and was dissolved in 2008; its two most successful products were proton-pump inhibitor lansoprazole (Prevacid) and the prostate cancer drug, <b>leuprorelin</b> ((Lupron). [...] The intention of the joint venture was to get products that Takeda had discovered developed, approved, and marketed in the US and Canada.|$|E
50|$|Maximum or maximal {{androgen}} blockade (MAB) or complete or combined {{androgen blockade}} (CAB) {{is a medical}} treatment involving the combination of both androgen receptor (AR) antagonism and inhibition or suppression of androgen production to attain maximal effectiveness in androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). An example of MAB is the combination of bicalutamide, an AR antagonist, with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue such as <b>leuprorelin</b> or cetrorelix. MAB was developed for and is employed {{in the treatment of}} prostate cancer.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} of Lupron Injection include redness/burning/stinging/pain/bruising at the {{injection}} site, hot flashes (flushing), increased sweating, night sweats, tiredness, headache, upset stomach, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, breast swelling or tenderness, acne, joint/muscle aches or pain, trouble sleeping (insomnia), reduced sexual interest, vaginal discomfort/dryness/itching/discharge, vaginal bleeding, swelling of the ankles/feet, increased urination at night, dizziness, breakthrough bleeding in a female child during the first 2 months of <b>leuprorelin</b> treatment, weakness, chills, clammy skin, skin redness, itching, or scaling, testicle pain, impotence, depression, or memory problems.|$|E
50|$|Like other NSAAs such as {{flutamide}} and bicalutamide, nilutamide, without concomitant GnRH analogue therapy, increases serum androgen (by two-fold in {{the case}} of testosterone), estrogen, and prolactin levels due to inhibition of AR-mediated suppression of steroidogenesis via negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. As such, though nilutamide is still effective as an antiandrogen as a monotherapy, it is given in combination with a GnRH analogue such as <b>leuprorelin</b> in prostate cancer to suppress androgen concentrations to castrate levels in order to attain maximal androgen blockade (MAB).|$|E
50|$|Analogs of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{can be used}} {{to induce}} a {{chemical}} castration, that is, complete suppression of the production of estrogen and progesterone from the female ovaries, or complete suppression of testosterone production from the male testes. This is due to a negative feedback effect of continuous stimulation of the pituitary gland by these hormones. <b>Leuprorelin</b> and goserelin are GnRH analogs which are used primarily for the treatment of hormone-responsive prostate cancer. Because the initial endocrine response to GnRH analogs is actually hypersecretion of gonadal steroids, hormone receptor antagonists such as flutamide are typically used to prevent a transient boost in tumor growth.|$|E
50|$|Another phase III trial {{known as}} PREVAIL is {{investigating}} the effectiveness of enzalutamide with patients {{who have not yet}} received chemotherapy. On October 22, 2013, Medivation and Astellas announced that the PREVAIL trial met both co-primary endpoints of overall survival, with a 30% reduction in the risk of death compared with placebo (hazard ratio = 0.7; 95% confidence interval, range of 0.59-0.83), and radiographic progression-free survival, with an 81% reduction in risk of radiographic progression or death compared with placebo (hazard ratio = 0.19); 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.23). In addition, a phase II trial began in March 2011 comparing enzalutamide with bicalutamide in prostate cancer patients who have progressed while on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue therapy (e.g., <b>leuprorelin)</b> or surgical castration.|$|E
5000|$|Abbott and Takeda {{agreed to}} end the {{partnership}} in 2008, with Abbott keeping the rights to <b>leuprorelin,</b> which had sales in 2007 of $600 million and a patent expiring in 2015 and the approximately 300 employees {{who worked on the}} product, and Takeda keeping the rights to lansoprazole, which had sales of $2.3 billion in 2007 but was facing imminent generic competition, along with 800 employees in the U.S. and all the drugs in the TAP pipeline. [...] Takeda was also obligated to pay Abbott about $1.5 billion over several years. [...] By 2008, Takeda's own sales in the US outside of TAP had grown to $3 billion, mostly from sales of pioglitazone which by then was the best-selling diabetes drug in the world.|$|E
50|$|A GnRH modulator, or GnRH {{receptor}} modulator, {{is a type}} of drug which modulates the GnRH receptor, {{the biological}} target of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). They include GnRH agonists and GnRH antagonists. These drugs may be GnRH analogues like <b>leuprorelin</b> and cetrorelix - peptides that are structurally related to GnRH - or small-molecules like relugolix, which are structurally distinct. GnRH modulators affect the secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which in turn affects the gonads, influencing their function and hence fertility as well as the production of sex steroids, including that of estradiol and progesterone in women and of testosterone in men. As such, GnRH modulators can also be described as progonadotropins or antigonadotropins, depending on whether they serve to increase or decrease gonadotropin levels.|$|E
50|$|DHT, {{and to a}} {{significantly}} smaller extent, testosterone, stimulate prostate cancer cells to grow. Therefore, blocking these androgens can provide powerful treatment for prostate cancer, especially metastatic disease. Normally administered are GnRH analogues, such as <b>leuprorelin</b> or cetrorelix. Although GnRH agonists stimulate the same receptors that GnRH does, since they are present continuously {{and not in a}} pulsatile manner, they serve to inhibit the pituitary gland and therefore block the whole chain. However, they initially cause a surge in activity; this is not solely a theoretical risk but may cause the cancer to flare. Flutamide was initially used at the beginning of GnRH agonist therapy to block this surge, and it and other NSAAs continue in this use. In contrast to GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists don't cause an initial androgen surge, and are gradually replacing GnRH agonists in clinical use.|$|E
