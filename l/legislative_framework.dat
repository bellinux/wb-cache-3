5|$|The county number, {{extent and}} {{authority}} have varied significantly, reflecting: {{changes in the}} monarchial and noble relative influences; Ottoman conquest and Croatian recapture of various territories; and societal and political changes through several centuries. In the 13th and 14th century, the Croatian nobility grew stronger and the counties defined by the king were reduced to a <b>legislative</b> <b>framework,</b> while military and financial power was concentrated in the feudal lords. Other forms of administration that overlapped with county administration in this period included the Roman Catholic Church and the free royal cities, and separately the cities of Dalmatia. After Croatia became a crown land of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1527, the importance of counties faded even further, but was gradually restored after 1760.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the IPT {{ruled that}} the <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> in the United Kingdom does not permit mass {{surveillance}} and that while GCHQ collects and analyses data in bulk, it does not practice mass surveillance. This complements independent reports by the Interception of Communications Commissioner, and a special report made by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament; although several shortcomings and potential improvements to both oversight and the <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> were highlighted.|$|E

25|$|The cabinet has {{no formal}} {{statutory}} basis {{and is not}} established by any legislative act: it exists purely by constitutional convention. This convention carries sufficient weight for many official declarations and regulations {{to refer to the}} cabinet, and a government department—the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet—is responsibile for supporting it. Although cabinet lacks any direct <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> for its existence, the Cabinet Manual has become the official document which governs its functions, and on which its convention rests.|$|E
25|$|In January 1953, in {{response}} to increasing pressure from the commercial lobby, the Menzies government amended the Broadcasting Act 1948 {{to allow for the}} granting of commercial licences, thus providing the <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> for a dual system of TV ownership. This structure was directly modeled on the long-established two-tiered structure of Australian broadcast radio—one tier being the stations in a new national, government-funded TV network run by the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC), and the other tier being privately owned commercial stations that drew their income from advertising revenue.|$|E

40|$|Forensic {{procedures}} and DNA profiling {{are commonly used}} policing techniques employed to solve crimes and prosecute offenders. In more recent times, {{there has been a}} focus on the implications of these processes with alleged young offenders. This paper discusses the broader human rights issues for young offenders around these {{procedures and}} processes in relation to a specific case study: <b>legislative</b> <b>frameworks</b> in Queensland, Australia. First, the paper overviews what forensic procedures and DNA databases are defined generally and the types of information that can be gleaned from DNA collected through forensic procedures and subsequently databased. Second, the paper analyses Queensland <b>legislative</b> <b>frameworks</b> in terms of human rights issues raised by conducting forensic procedures and DNA databasing with alleged young offenders. The paper concludes by considering possible future directions around forensic procedures and DNA databasing with alleged young offenders with reference to existing <b>legislative</b> <b>frameworks...</b>|$|R

25|$|Negotiations, {{in which}} Usery {{played a key}} role, {{resolved}} the postal strike in just two weeks. Postal unions, Nixon administration officials and Congressional aides not only negotiated a contract which gave the unions most of what they wanted, but which also established a <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> {{which led to the}} Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. Under the act, postal unions won the right to negotiate on wages, benefits and working conditions. On July 1, 1971, five federal postal unions merged to form the American Postal Workers Union, the largest postal workers union in the world.|$|E
25|$|Canada adopted {{its first}} Official Languages Act in 1969, in {{response}} to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. The current Official Languages Act was adopted in 1988 to improve the 1969 law's efforts to address two basic policy objectives: (1) to specify the powers, duties and functions of federal institutions relevant to official languages; (2) to support the development of linguistic minority communities. As well, following the adoption in 1982 of the Charter of Rights, it was necessary to create a <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> within which the Government of Canada could respect its new constitutional obligations regarding the official languages.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to the {{development}} of most schools, All Hallows' School, as the first Catholic secondary school in Queensland, sought to serve those less fortunate in colonial society while operating under the same <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> as the more affluent grammar schools. Serving poorer, often Irish, Roman Catholic, immigrant women in the area of Fortitude Valley, the School did not raise the required subscription for government aid and, in a time of bitter sectarianism within Queensland, the school maintained fierce independence in curriculum from what was seen by many within the Catholic community as attempts by a hostile secular government at interference.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{some of the}} emerging mecha-nisms related to transboundary water management. It presents ideas for conflict resolution on trans-boundary waters, addressing some of the principal driving forces for conflicts, mainly the insufficiency of available water resources, {{and the lack of}} effec-tive <b>legislative</b> <b>frameworks</b> for sharing transbound-ary waters. The article highlights the importance of “green ” wa-ter assessment, and the importance of adapting the <b>legislative</b> <b>frameworks</b> to consider all forms of avail-able water resources at the transboundary river basin level and at the national level to reduce chances of conflicts in transboundary river basins. It also em-phasizes the notion of "no-harm " and protection of pri-or appropriation of water rights in transboundary wa-ter management...|$|R

25|$|Most of the {{original}} societies were fully terminating, {{where they would be}} dissolved when all members had a house: the last of them, First Salisbury and District Perfect Thrift Building Society, was wound up in March 1980. In the 1830s and 1840s a new development took place with the permanent building society, where the society continued on a rolling basis, continually taking in new members as earlier ones completed purchases, such as Leek United Building Society. The main <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> for the building society was the Building Societies Act 1874, with subsequent amending legislation in 1894, 1939 (see Coney Hall), and 1960.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution gives {{each state}} {{legislature}} {{the power to}} decide how its state's electors are chosen {{and it can be}} easier and cheaper for a state legislature to simply appoint a slate of electors than to create a <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> for holding elections to determine the electors. As noted above, the two situations in which legislative choice has been used since the Civil War have both been because there was not enough time or money to prepare for an election. However, appointment by state legislature can have negative consequences: bicameral legislatures can deadlock more easily than the electorate. This is precisely what happened to New York in 1789 when the legislature failed to appoint any electors.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{under the}} new <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> of the Species At Risk Act , COSEWIC placed the Newfoundland and Labrador {{fisheries}} cod on {{the endangered species list}} and Fisheries Minister Robert Thibault announced an indefinite closure in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and off Newfoundland's northeast coast. In a 2004 report, the WWF agreed the Barents Sea cod fishery appeared to be healthy, but that the situation may not last due to illegal fishing, industrial development, and high quotas. In 2005, the WWF—Canada accused both foreign and Canadian fishing vessels of deliberate, large-scale violations of the restrictions on the Grand Banks, in the form of bycatch. WWF also claimed poor enforcement by NAFO, an intergovernmental organization with a mandate to provide scientific fishery advice and management in the northwestern Atlantic.|$|E

25|$|In May 1946, Ion Antonescu was prosecuted at {{the first}} in a series of People's Tribunals, on charges of war crimes, crimes against the peace and treason. The tribunals had first been {{proposed}} by the PNȚ, and was compatible with the Nuremberg Trials in Allied-occupied Germany. The Romanian <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> was drafted by coup participant Pătrășcanu, a PCR member who had been granted leadership of the Justice Ministry. Despite the idea having earned support from several sides of the political spectrum, the procedures were politicized in a sense favorable to the PCR and the Soviet Union, and posed a legal problem for being based on ex post facto decisions. The first such local trial took place in 1945, resulting in the sentencing of Iosif Iacobici, Nicolae Macici, Constantin Trestioreanu and other military commanders directly involved in planning or carrying out the Odessa massacre.|$|E
25|$|After his {{resignation}} in May 2013, Kumar was elected as a Congress Party {{member of the}} Public Accounts Committee of Parliament.

Kumar addressed a session of the United Nations General Assembly and United Nations Security Council in October 2013 as member of the Indian Parliamentary Delegation to United Nations General Assembly. In September 2014, Dr. Kumar was appointed Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science, Technology, Environment and Forests, which also concerns itself with <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> for Atomic Energy and Space, as a Congress party nominee.

25|$|In federal legislation, the key planks for {{the right}} to a useful and remunerative job {{included}} the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. After the war was the Employment Act of 1946, which created an objective for the government to eliminate unemployment, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited unjustified discrimination in the workplace and in access to public and private services. They remained some of the key elements of US labor law. The rights to food and fair agricultural wages was assured by numerous Acts on agriculture in the United States and by the Food Stamp Act of 1964. The right to freedom from unfair competition was primarily seen to be achievable through the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice's enforcement of both the Sherman Act of 1890 and the Clayton Act of 1914, with some minor later amendments. The most significant program of change occurred through Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. The right to housing was developed through a policy of subsidies and government building under the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965. The right to health care was partly improved by the Social Security Act of 1965 and, more recently, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The Social Security Act of 1935 had laid the groundwork for protection from fear of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment. The right to a decent education was shaped heavily by Supreme Court jurisprudence, and the administration of education was left to the states, particularly with Brown v. Board of Education. A <b>legislative</b> <b>framework</b> developed through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and in higher education, a measure of improvement began with federal assistance and regulation in the Higher Education Act of 1965.|$|E
