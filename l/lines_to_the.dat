5|$|By 1860, Houston {{had emerged}} as a {{commercial}} and railroad hub for the export of cotton. Railroad spurs from the Texas inland converged in Houston, where they met rail <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ports of Galveston and Beaumont. During the American Civil War, Houston served as a headquarters for General John Bankhead Magruder, who used the city as an organization point for the Battle of Galveston. After the Civil War, Houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the city's extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between downtown and the nearby port of Galveston. By 1890, Houston was the railroad center of Texas.|$|E
5|$|During the 1959 revolt in Lhasa, Sera monastery {{suffered}} severe damage, {{with its}} colleges destroyed {{and hundreds of}} monks killed. After the Dalai Lama took asylum in India, many of the monks of Sera who survived the attack moved to Bylakuppe in Mysore, India. After initial tribulations, they established a parallel Sera Monastery with Sera Me and Sera Je colleges and a Great Assembly Hall on similar <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original monastery, {{with help from the}} Government of India. There are now 3000 or more monks living in Sera, India and this community has also spread its missionary activities to several countries by establishing Dharma centres, propagating knowledge of Buddhism.|$|E

5|$|Four {{different}} long-term expansion {{proposals were}} put forward between 1964 and 1991 which all proposed adding numerous <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> network {{as well as}} extending the existing ones. Given the political instability characteristic of Argentina during this time, none of these proposals came to fruition, though aspects {{of them have been}} incorporated into contemporary expansion plans. One additional proposal put forward in 1973 saw the unification of the city's commuter rail lines through underground tunnels and incorporated into the Buenos Aires Underground, and while this was also shelved, it has been adapted into the current Red de Expresos Regionales proposal.|$|E
5|$|In Trondheim, the {{existing}} railway station for the Trondhjem–Støren Line was {{built as a}} cul-de-sac station at Kalvskinnet. This could not serve the Meråker Line and the station was thus moved to Brattøra, an artificial peninsula immediately {{north of the city}} center. Thus the station became located next to the new port facility. With the construction of the Røros Line, it was decided to connect both <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same station. The cost of the new station was 1.4 million kroner. Trondheim Station did not open until 1882.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the assault}} of the 2nd New Zealand Division had drawn in both 15 and 21 Panzer Divisions, {{with the result}} that there was a wide gap in the Axis <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south west. Through this gap Montgomery pushed the {{remainder}} of his armour, breaking the Afrika Korps line and pushing westwards into its rear areas and supply lines. By 4 November, the battle was won and Montgomery was entertaining the captured Afrika Korps commander, von Thoma, to dinner in his caravan.|$|E

5|$|Since 1992, {{the city}} has {{undergone}} several boundary expansions. One expansion incorporated undeveloped land in the southeast for an industrial park and a Louisiana-Pacific Canada veneer factory. The city extended sewer and water <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> location; however, the area was not developed and with the factory only half-built, L-P Canada abandoned its plans. A business making manufactured homes bought the factory and completed its development in 2005. Another expansion incorporated the existing oriented strand board factory in {{the northwest corner of}} the city, while further incorporations have included undeveloped land to the south and north.|$|E
5|$|The Premetro was {{originally}} intended to include a number of feeder <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Underground network, including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina's transition to democracy from the military junta and then the privatisation of the railways, which was a difficult time economically for the country, and only Line E2 was built. New Premetro feeder lines have been proposed in recent years, however, {{the role of the}} network has given way to the new Metrobus network which covers many of the same routes originally intended for the Premetro.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} was organized along similar <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British and American {{armed forces of}} the time, in which a small standing army could quickly augment its strength during emergencies from a reserve militia force (in Brazil, the National Guard). Brazil's first line of defense relied upon a large and powerful navy to protect against foreign attack. As a matter of policy, the {{military was}} to be completely obedient to civilian governmental control and to remain at arm's length from involvement in political decisions.|$|E
5|$|Wellesley's {{understanding}} of logistics was to prove valuable in leading an expeditionary force against the French invasion of Portugal and Spain. He was adept at planning long marches through unknown territory, understanding {{that he not}} only had thousands of men to manage efficiently, but that {{a huge amount of}} supplies were required to adequately feed and sustain his army. Secure supply <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese coast were of vital importance if he was to maintain his ability to fight the French.|$|E

5|$|Apollonius' {{problem has}} other applications. In Book 1, Proposition 21 in his Principia, Isaac Newton used his {{solution}} of Apollonius' problem {{to construct an}} orbit in celestial mechanics {{from the center of}} attraction and observations of tangent <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> orbit corresponding to instantaneous velocity. The special case of the problem of Apollonius when all three circles are tangent is used in the Hardy–Littlewood circle method of analytic number theory to construct Hans Rademacher's contour for complex integration, given by the boundaries of an infinite set of Ford circles each of which touches several others. Finally, Apollonius' problem has been applied to some types of packing problems, which arise in disparate fields such as the error-correcting codes used on DVDs and the design of pharmaceuticals that bind in a particular enzyme of a pathogenic bacterium.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were then}} made to {{establish}} batteries {{to the west}} and north of the city, but these efforts were hampered by heavy rain, delaying the construction of defensive earthworks which allowed the garrison to maintain a constant fire on the work parties, which suffered consequent casualties. Fire was especially heavy against the siege <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of the city, which were easily targeted by the French gunners on 12 August. Operations to establish batteries on this front continued for several days even as losses mounted; on 15 August, Lieutenant Colonel George Maule, Braithwaite's chief engineer, was killed by cannon fire while returning from a night inspection of the trenches. On the night of 21 August the main battery, known as the Royal Battery, came under heavy shellfire and was damaged, but repairs were successful and on the morning of 22 August its 24-pounder long guns opened return fire on the city.|$|E
5|$|Control of the Adriatic brought {{numerous}} {{advantages to}} the French Navy, allowing rapid transit of troops from Italy to the Balkans and Austria for campaigning {{in the east}} and giving France possession of numerous shipbuilding facilities, particularly the large naval yards of Venice. From 1807, when the Treaty of Tilsit precipitated a Russian withdrawal from the Septinsular Republic, the French Navy held naval supremacy in the region. The Treaty of Tilsit also contained a secret clause that guaranteed French assistance in any war fought between the Russians and the Ottoman Empire. To fulfil this clause, Napoleon would have to secure his supply <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east by developing the French armies in Illyria. This required control of the Adriatic against increasingly aggressive British raiders. The Royal Navy determined to stop these troop convoys from reaching Illyria and sought to break French hegemony in the region, resulting in a six-year naval campaign.|$|E
