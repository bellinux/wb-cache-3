25|$|Although some sugarcanes produce seeds, modern stem cutting {{has become}} the most common {{reproduction}} method. Each cutting must contain at least one bud, and the cuttings are sometimes hand-planted. In more technologically advanced countries like the United States and Australia, billet planting is common. Billets harvested from a mechanical harvester are planted by a machine that opens and recloses the ground. Once planted, a stand can be harvested several times; after each harvest, the cane sends up new stalks, called ratoons. Successive harvests give decreasing yields, eventually justifying replanting. Two to 10 harvests are usually made {{depending on the type of}} culture. In a country with a mechanical agriculture looking for a high production of large fields, like in North America, sugar canes are replanted after two or three harvests to avoid a <b>lowering</b> <b>in</b> yields. In countries with a more traditional type of agriculture with smaller fields and hand harvesting, like in the French island la Réunion, sugar canes are often harvested up to 10 years before replanting.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Objective: This study {{investigated}} {{the changes in the}} anterior pituitary hormones of patients who were admitted to an emergency service and diagnosed with acute meningitis. Methods: A total of 21 patients who were admitted to an emergency service between 01 January and 31 October 2012, and diagnosed with meningitis, were included. Blood samples were collected from the patients within an initial 24 hours of admission and at month 6, in order to measure thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), growth hormone (GH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels. The results were analyzed using SSPS- 18 software. Results: Of the patients, 47. 6 % were male, and 52. 4 % were female. At month 6, TSH, LH, and ACTH levels were higher than those measured on admission. This difference was meaningful for TSH, but insignificant for LH and ACTH. At month 6, mean GH, FSH, and PRL levels were lower than admission levels. At the time of admission, FSH was at lower than normal levels in seven patients, LH was <b>lower</b> <b>in</b> six patients, TSH was <b>lower</b> <b>in</b> four patients, GH was <b>lower</b> <b>in</b> four patients, and ACTH <b>in</b> was <b>lower</b> <b>in</b> three patients. At month 6, FSH was <b>lower</b> <b>in</b> five patients, LH was <b>lower</b> <b>in</b> four patients, TSH was <b>lower</b> <b>in</b> one patient, GH was <b>lower</b> <b>in</b> six patients, and ACTH was <b>lower</b> <b>in</b> five patients. Conclusion: The differences between hormone levels at admission and at month 6 show that meningitis causes changes in anterior pituitary hormones...|$|R

500|$|Based on the Aufbau principle, {{one would}} expect the 5g {{subshell}} to begin filling at unbiunium. However, the f-block is theoretically expected to begin at lanthanum and actinium, but neither element shows any f-orbital involvement. It is predicted that a similar situation of delayed [...] "radial" [...] collapse might happen for unbiunium, so that the 5g orbitals do not start filling until around element 125. This {{is similar to the}} situation with lanthanum, where the 4f shell has not yet undergone the sudden contraction and <b>lowering</b> <b>in</b> energy to the level it will have in the lanthanide series; even in the next element, cerium, this contraction is not yet complete enough to avoid occupation of the 5d orbital. The delay in the contraction of the 5g orbitals is expected to be so large that occupation of the 6f, 7d, and 8p1/2 subshells cannot be avoided in any superactinide. Because of the lack of radial nodes in the 5g orbitals, analogous to the 4f but not the 5f orbitals, the position of unbiunium in the periodic table is expected to be more akin to that of lanthanum than that of actinium among its congeners, and some have proposed to rename the superactinides as [...] "superlanthanides" [...] for that reason. The lack of radial nodes in the 4f orbitals contribute to their core-like behaviour in the lanthanide series, unlike the more valence-like 5f orbitals in the actinides; however, the relativistic expansion and destabilisation of the 5g orbitals should partially compensate for their lack of radial nodes and hence smaller extent.|$|E

2500|$|To {{lower the}} larynx is to {{increase}} the length of the vocal tract, in turn lowering formant frequencies so that the voice sounds [...] "deeper"nbsp&— giving an impression of greater size. John Ohala argues that the function of the lowered larynx in humans, especially males, is probably to enhance threat displays rather than speech itself. Ohala points out that if the lowered larynx were an adaptation for speech, we would expect adult human males to be better adapted in this respect than adult females, whose larynx is considerably less low. In fact, females invariably outperform males in verbal tests, falsifying this whole line of reasoning. W. Tecumseh Fitch likewise argues that this was the original selective advantage of laryngeal <b>lowering</b> <b>in</b> our species. Although (according to Fitch) the initial lowering of the larynx in humans {{had nothing to do with}} speech, the increased range of possible formant patterns was subsequently co-opted for speech. Size exaggeration remains the sole function of the extreme laryngeal descent observed in male deer. Consistent with the size exaggeration hypothesis, a second descent of the larynx occurs at puberty in humans, although only in males. In response to the objection that the larynx is descended in human females, Fitch suggests that mothers vocalising to protect their infants would also have benefited from this ability.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1815 the Regents Canal Company built {{a double}} caisson lock [...] (or [...] "hydro-pneumatic lock") {{at the site}} of the [...] present-day Hampstead Road Lock, north London. The {{designer}} was military engineer William Congreve. Here the motivation was, principally, water supply problems but also to effect a quicker passage of vessels, as those going in opposite directions could pass in the lock. The caissons—always submerged, as at Coombe Hay—were without bottoms and were arranged so that their sides dropped into deep underwater channels formed by [...] "minor walls" [...] inside the main walls. The vertical movement of the two caissons was effected by a balance pipe ("the channel of communication") passing under the lock floor between the two caisson chambers (but with a slight upturn to reach above the water levels), so that causing an increase of water level in one caisson ("the water of compression") displaced air through the pipe, thus forcing a corresponding decrease in the water level in the other. This increased the buoyancy of the latter caisson, which accordingly rose as the first sank. A connecting underwater chain passing through rollers, while not in itself doing any work, controlled the relative positions. Boats were admitted through double gates; the inside ones on the caisson [...] "adjusted to fit close [...] to those of the outer". Congreve's patent then envisaged that having achieved [...] "absolute equipoise" [...] (neutral buoyancy) a rack-and-pinion, removable weights or a small winch could overcome inertia [...] and move the caissons. In a practical demonstration at Hampstead Road Congreve later elected to deploy an air compressor releasing into one caisson, estimating that one man could achieve raising and <b>lowering</b> <b>in</b> three minutes—the company's enabling act did not permit the installation of stationary steam engines. However it was found the fastest overall time was six minutes and that the effort required rendered the operator [...] "incapable of further exertion". Furthermore, as the operation of the device depended upon air pressure inside the caissons (whether the means of moving them was by varying this air pressure or otherwise) when contractor Henry Maudslay delivered them and they were found to leak air, the scheme failed. [...] In 1818, after many unsuccessful repair attempts, the company substituted conventional locks.|$|E
