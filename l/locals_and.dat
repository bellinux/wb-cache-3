This Handbook is organized into seven inter-related sections, with an introductory chapter setting out the rationale, aims {{and structure of the}} Handbook. Section one situates <b>local</b> <b>and</b> regional development in its global context. Section two establishes the key issues in understanding the principles and values that help us define what is meant by <b>local</b> <b>and</b> regional development. Section three critically reviews the current diversity and variety of conceptual and theoretical approaches to <b>local</b> <b>and</b> regional development. Section four address questions of government and governance. Section five connects critically with the array of contemporary approaches to <b>local</b> <b>and</b> regional development policy. Section six is an explicitly global review of perspectives on <b>local</b> <b>and</b> regional development from Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America and North America. Section seven provides reflection and discussion of the futures for <b>local</b> <b>and</b> regional development in an international and multidisciplinary context.

Second, the nature, character <b>and</b> forms of <b>local</b> <b>and</b> regional development are examined to reveal its different varieties, principles and values in different places and time periods. Third, the objects, subjects and social welfare dimensions are addressed to explain the often socially uneven and geographically differentiated distribution of who and where benefits and loses from particular forms of <b>local</b> <b>and</b> regional development. Last, a holistic, progressive and sustainable version is outlined and reflections offered upon the limits and political renewal of <b>local</b> <b>and</b> regional development.

40|$|One in {{four people}} suffers from chronic {{musculoskeletal}} pain (CMP). Acupuncture points stimulation is increasingly used for pain relief for CMP. Commonly, {{a combination of}} <b>local</b> <b>and</b> distant points is used. However, {{the difference between the}} effects of <b>local</b> <b>and</b> distant point stimulation is unknown. This systematic review aimed to determine if there was a difference in effects between stimulating <b>local</b> <b>and</b> distant points, and the combination of both when compared with either alone. English and Chinese electronic databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials, where local or distant points were stimulated in adults with CMP. Pain intensity was the primary outcome measure. Nineteen were included in the qualitative analysis and 15 in the meta-analysis. <b>Local</b> <b>and</b> distant point stimulation was more effective than their respective controls in pain reduction immediately after treatment. Three studies directly compared the stimulation of <b>local</b> <b>and</b> distant points and found {{no significant difference between the}} two. No studies compared combined <b>local</b> <b>and</b> distant point stimulation with either alone. Subgroup analyses showed that, local tender point stimulation was more effective than local acupuncture points. <b>Local</b> <b>and</b> distant point stimulation induces similar degree of acupuncture analgesia. The benefit of combining <b>local</b> <b>and</b> distant point stimulation is unknown. However, subgroup analyses suggested that local tender points could be important in the treatment of CMP for short-term pain relief...|$|R
