5000|$|The 1983 Tube stock owed {{much to the}} sub-surface D Stock in design. Like D Stock, the 1983 Tube Stock had single <b>leaf</b> <b>doors,</b> {{a similar}} orange {{interior}} and cab design. Unlike the D Stock however, the 1983 Tube Stock proved to be unreliable. Electrical generators for lighting the carriages failed often, as did the motors. Boarding of passengers was slow because of the single <b>leaf</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R

50|$|Stagecoach won {{the tender}} {{to operate the}} service, with the buses chosen being the Olymbus model built by Designline in New Zealand and which had been {{introduced}} into service in Christchurch in 1998. Stagecoach boss Brian Souter had arranged {{the purchase of a}} prototype Olymbus while on a visit to Stagecoach New Zealand. It arrived in October 2004 and toured the country in Stagecoach corporate livery on proving trials until April 2005. A further nine buses followed, with the fleet of ten being allocated to the Walkergate depot, which received the necessary upgrades to accommodate them. They were substantially modified for operation in the UK, notably using a <b>leaf</b> <b>door</b> design over the plug design. While the buses were double doored, the middle door was only provided for wheelchair access. Prior to launch, all ten buses were pictured on the Quayside with local dignitaries and partner representatives.|$|E
50|$|This simple cottage {{is located}} {{approximately}} twelve to fifteen metres {{from the northern}} end of the house. A narrow concrete path leads between it and the grassed courtyard of the house. The cottage is rectangular in plan and has a gable roof clad in corrugated iron. Timber stumps support the timber floor framing. A verandah approximately one and a half metres wide faces back toward the house and is accessed via a short flight of timber stairs. The cottage roof is supported at the outer verandah edge on simple timber posts. A timber top rail rests on a centred timber baluster. The verandah deck is clad in wide timber boards and the exterior walls are clad with weatherboards. A window on the short eastern facade is sheltered by a curved hood clad in corrugated iron and supported on a largely solid bracket. Two casement windows open onto the verandah and have two lights in each leaf. A single <b>leaf</b> <b>door</b> opens off this verandah. A fenceline composed of timber picket parts, the trunk of a mature tree and a section of posts and rails, runs between the north-east corner of the house and a point approximately two-thirds the way {{along the length of the}} cottage.|$|E
50|$|The {{main entry}} to the {{building}} is from Creek Street by a recently constructed ramp structure that abuts the verandah. A centrally located set of French doors form the main {{entry to the}} school however there are also two single <b>leaf</b> <b>doors</b> located {{either side of the}} main doors providing a secondary entry to the hall and separate entry to the enclosed verandah and area that was once the library. A secondary access to the hall is provided via a timber stair which adjoins the southern enclosed verandah.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} {{retains its}} original partitions, constructed of cement plaster on vertical steel rods and metal lathe. The {{rooms on the}} enclosed front and rear verandahs have walls lined with vertically jointed tongue and groove boards The ceilings throughout {{the core of the}} building are lined with flat sheet and timber cover battens in a simple geometric pattern and on the upper level there are ventilation panels that have been sheeted closed with the grille potentially surviving behind. The ceilings to the enclosed verandah are lined with vertically jointed tongue and groove boards {{with the exception of the}} front ground floor which has a ceiling lined with ripple iron. No original ceiling fittings have been retained with modern light fixtures and ceiling fans found throughout. The cornice is a square, timber cover strip. Internally, windows and doors have distinctive, tapered timber architraves. Generally the doors have 3 panels and are high-waisted, and almost all retain their original hardware including keyhole covers. Those opening onto the now enclosed verandahs are French with low waists and twelve lights in the upper section of each <b>leaf.</b> <b>Door</b> panel mouldings and skirtings differ between the original building and later extension. Windows, where original, are multi-paned, retain original hardware, and most have had their glass painted out. The skirtings are timber and are a simple ogee in the oldest part and a simple splay in the 1938 extension. The floors are linoleum sheets and tiles, or carpet throughout. The original crows ash timber flooring may survive underneath. The central spaces on both levels have chair rails and the first floor waiting area contains a picture rail.|$|E

2500|$|Montreal's Metro {{trains are}} made of {{low-alloy}} high-tensile steel, painted blue with a thick white stripe running lengthwise. Trains are assembled in three-, six- or nine-car lengths.

Each car is [...] wide and has three (MPM-10) or four (MR-63, MR-73) wide bi-parting <b>leaf</b> <b>doors</b> on each side for rapid passenger entry and egress. Design specifications called for station dwell times of typically 8 to 15 seconds. In response to overcrowding on the Orange Line, a redesign of the MR-73 cars removed some seats to provide more standing room. The newest Bombardier MPM-10 trains allow people to move between cars once on board, so that the passenger load is more evenly distributed.|$|R
50|$|The M8s {{have new}} roomier, high-back seats with {{individual}} headrests and curved arm rests for more comfort. For improved safety, {{especially in the}} vestibules, the car have larger windows and better lighting. An additional safety feature is the installation of intercom systems that customers can use to contact the train crew in case of emergency. Other features included curved luggage racks, coat hooks, electrical outlets to charge personal devices, and LED displays that show that next stop and automated announcements. The cars also have external public address speakers, and electronic destination signs. Higher reliability is possible with single <b>leaf</b> <b>doors,</b> which also lessen the susceptibility to snow intrusion. Also, the M8s have sealed alternating current motors that are less susceptible to weather.|$|R

50|$|The Class 92 is {{designed}} for low dwell times and high passenger seating capacity, being built with three double <b>leaf</b> <b>doors</b> per side and having full longitudinal seating at its cab-coaches. Its middle coaches feature a mixture of longitudinal and traverse 2+2 seating. It has wide gang-ways interconnecting each coach, allowing passengers to distribute effectively throughout {{the length of the}} train. However, two middle coaches of the class 92 is designated women's only coaches by its operator KTM. Thus, limiting full interactivity within the train set. Dynamic route maps located above doors details trains position relative to station in real-time. CCTVs and 3-pin power outlets are provided as further features. Since the train is to operate in the tropics, the trains have an over-head air-conditioning systems, to provide ventilation, dehumidification and comfortable temperature control.|$|R

50|$|The {{intercity}} role of Class 93 requires longer station {{dwell times}} {{and a higher}} passenger seating comfort, so they have been designed with single <b>leaf</b> <b>doors</b> at each end and side of each carriage, fitted with end to end traverse 2+2 seating. In addition to this, it also features standard intercity offerings such as luggage racks, a toilet and prayer area within the length of an individual 6-car set. It has gang-ways interconnecting each coach, allowing passengers unrestricted movement throughout {{the entire length of}} the train. CCTV and 3-pin power outlets are provided as further features.
