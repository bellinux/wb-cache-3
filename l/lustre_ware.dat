It was founded in 1955 by Alan Caiger-Smith and was known for its tin-glaze pottery and {{particularly}} its <b>lustre</b> <b>ware.</b> Alan Caiger-Smith worked with almost sixty assistants {{over a period of}} forty years at the Pottery; the first, Geoffrey Eastop, joined him in 1956, a year after the pottery started.|$|E

It was at that moment that I had my first encounter with Islamic ceramics. Just like their woven counterparts these have the same combination of warmth of colour, delicacy and boldness of design. Above all, I admire the <b>lustre</b> <b>ware</b> which to my mind is the greatest gift the Islamic potter has made to mankind." ...|$|E

Chinese wares like eggshell ware, Yeuh and Qingbai porcelains and glazed stoneware were also recovered though in smaller numbers. The ceramics were studied and published by Dr. Rukshana Nanji. The published report is the first volume in the Sanjan Excavation Report Series. The glass was studied by Ms. Rhea Mitra-Dalal. Human remains were studied by Dr Veena Mushrif-Tripathi and published as the second volume in the series.|$|E

Lightbown a detailed contemporary description of the materials and methods of Renaissance maiolica, Cipriano Piccolpasso's I Tre Libre Dell'Arte Del Vasaio (The Three Books of the Potter’s Art) (1980). His history of <b>lustre</b> <b>ware,</b> Lustre Pottery, was published in 1985. Caiger-Smith was Chairman of the British Crafts Centre (1973-1978) and was awarded the MBE in 1988. He ceased employing assistants in 1993 to concentrate on personal work and in 2006 announced his decision to sell the Aldermaston Pottery.|$|E

40|$|The {{surfaces}} of <b>lustre</b> <b>ware</b> ceramics, famously produced at numerous centres {{in the medieval}} world, are commonly decorated with shiny, metallic designs. Other related and contemporary ceramic types, such as polychrome mina’i wares, were embellished with gold leaf producing a similar effect. In today’s museum settings, the display of such objects is problematic because {{it is difficult to}} illustrate one of their most attractive qualities, namely how light interacts with their shiny, golden surfaces. Even with the provision of multiple conventional photographs, it remains virtually impossible to experience fully the light-related properties of lustred or gilded ceramics without handling the objects in person. This paper presents results of a study which used polynomial texture mapping (or PTM) to record the texture, surface reflectance and colour of selected lustre and mina’i wares from the Islamic pottery collection at The Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. In addition, the paper considers how computer graphic techniques will assist such work in the future. Results of the study reveal how, through the creation of surface visualisations using PTM, it is possible to reveal the effects of varying lighting on the {{surfaces of}} lustre and mina’i wares, thus creating an alternative to handling these objects. In the future, through this technique, it will be possible not only to appreciate such ceramics in their modern setting, but also to consider how they may have been experienced by past societies...|$|E
