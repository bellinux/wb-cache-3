5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair <b>length</b> <b>and</b> age, which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair <b>length</b> <b>and</b> hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair <b>length</b> <b>and</b> quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair <b>length</b> <b>and</b> marital status, or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair <b>length</b> <b>and</b> age.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to normal-length spines, {{members of the}} subfamily Opuntioideae have relatively short spines, called glochids, that are barbed along their <b>length</b> <b>and</b> easily shed. These enter the skin and are difficult to remove, causing long-lasting irritation.|$|E

5|$|Subdivision rules give a {{sequence}} of tilings of a surface, and tilings give an idea of distance, <b>length,</b> <b>and</b> area (by letting each tile have <b>length</b> <b>and</b> area 1). In the limit, the distances that come from these tilings may converge in some sense to an analytic structure on the surface. The Combinatorial Riemann Mapping Theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for this to occur.|$|E
