5000|$|The {{completely}} reconstructed Royal Cinema, with 600 seats, {{opened with}} a fanfare of publicity on 17 November 1947. The first film to be shown was Cole Porter's musical Night and Day. Limerick cinema goers enjoyed many films at the Royal over the next 30 years or so. In the early 1980s, {{a number of factors}} began to impact the cinema trade. The growing popularity and availability of videocassette recorders inspired the growing trade of the video rental shops, which in turn accelerated a decline in cinema audiences. A further problem in Ireland was the 23% VAT rate on cinema admissions. Indeed, this was cited as an [...] "intolerable burden" [...] and the reason for the ultimate closure of the cinema. A Limerick <b>Leader</b> <b>article</b> noted that Limerick, which once had 4,600 cinema seats, was now reduced to one cinema, the Carlton. Efforts by Alderman Jim Kemmy, TD, and others to save the cinema, failed. The last film to be screened at the cinema was Police Academy 2, in March 1985.|$|E
5000|$|A {{selection}} from Whitty's parliamentary sketches {{was published}} anonymously in 1854 as the History of the Session 1852-3: a Parliamentary Retrospect.

A series of Whitty's <b>Leader</b> <b>articles</b> was collected in The Governing Classes of Great Britain: Political Portraits (London, 1854; with additions, 1859). The volume {{is said to have}} greatly impressed Montalembert. The phrase [...] "the governing classes" [...] is earlier found in Thomas Carlyle (Cromwell's Letters and Speeches, 1845, ii. 150), but became identified with Whitty's volume; Robert Barnabas Brough dedicated to him in 1855 his Songs of the Governing Classes.|$|R

Montefiore who was President of Anglo-Jewish Association, {{would later be}} brushed aside by Weizmann as irrelevant.

5000|$|The Constitution {{stresses}} the importance of the clergy in government, with Article 4 stating that “all civil, criminal, financial, economic, administrative, cultural, military, political, and all other statutes and regulations (must) be keeping with Islamic measures;…the Islamic legal scholars of the watch council (shura yi nigahban) will keep watch over this.” and the importance of the Supreme <b>Leader.</b> <b>Article</b> 5 states “during the absence of the removed Twelfth Imam (may God hasten his reappearance) government and leadership of the community in the Islamic Republic of Iran belong to the rightful God fearing… legal scholar (Faqih) who is recognized and acknowledged as the Islamic leader by the majority of the population.” Article 107 in the constitution mentions Imam Khomeini by name and praises him as the most learned and talented leader for emulation (marja-i taqlid). The responsibilities of the Supreme Leader are vaguely stated in the constitution, thus any ‘violation’ by the Supreme Leader would be dismissed almost immediately. As the rest of the clergy governed affairs on a daily basis, the Supreme Leader is capable of mandating a new decision as per the concept of Vilayat-e Faqih. (Halm, 120-121) ...|$|E

40|$|There has {{recently}} been much debate about social policy in Britain during the Second World War. This article takes up Jose Harris's suggestion that historians should look not at large-scale forces, but at ‘those minuscule roots of idiosyncratic private culture’. As a way into the complex amalgam that comprised ideas on social policy in the 1940 s, we look in particular at the report on the evacuation of schoolchildren entitled Our towns: a close up, published by the Women's Group on Public Welfare in March 1943. Of course it is undeniable that one report is unrepresentative of all the many surveys that were produced on the evacuation experience. However, the initial wave of evacuation in September 1939 was the most significant, and the Our towns survey, along with a famous <b>leader</b> <b>article</b> in The Economist, has already received some selective attention from historians. Here we subject the survey to a more intensive examination, looking at the backgrounds of its authors, its content, and its reception by various professional groups. The article argues {{that it was the}} apparently contradictory nature of the report that explains its powerful appeal – it echoed interwar debates about behaviour and citizenship, but also reflected the ideas that would shape the welfare state in the post-war years...|$|E
