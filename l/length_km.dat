This study examined associations between objectively-measured environmental characteristics of neighbourhoods and adiposity cross-sectionally and longitudinally {{over three years}} in children and their female carers. Methods Longitudinal study of 140 5 - 6 year-old and 269 10 - 12 year-old children and their female carers (n = 369). At baseline (2001) and follow-up (2004), height and weight were measured among children and self-reported among female carers, and were used to compute BMI z-scores and BMI, respectively. A Geographic Information System determined access to destinations (public open spaces, sports options, walking/cycling tracks), road connectivity (density of cul-de-sacs and intersections, proportion of 4 -way intersections, length of 2 ̆ 7 access 2 ̆ 7 paths (overpasses, access lanes, throughways between buildings)) and traffic exposure (length of 2 ̆ 7 busy 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 local 2 ̆ 7 roads) within 800 m and 2 km of home.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2000 Hydrologic changes {{resulting}} from urban development degrade the biological conditions of stream ecosystems by modifying annual and inter-annual stream flow patterns. In urban streams, discharge {{is less than}} mean annual discharge on more days of the year, discharge exceeds the magnitude of frequent floods for a shorter duration of time, and the peak discharge rate of the annual maximum flood is less variable than in suburban streams. These hydrologic changes may cause increases in the frequency and extent of disturbances in urban streams. Floods and drought are common forms of disturbance in stream ecosystems. The biological effects of these hydrologic disturbances depend on their spatial extent and frequency. The extent of seasonal drought was documented in 59 Puget Lowland stream basins. Streams draining 1. 2 km 2 had a 50 % probability of being dry during summer base flow conditions (ephemeral). The <b>length</b> (<b>km)</b> of perennial streams in a basin varied as a linear function of drainage area (km 2), L = 0. 4 A + 0. 8 with a {{root mean square error}} of 0. 04 km. While urban development did not influence the extent of perennial streams in the basins, it may reduce the period of continuous flow during winter and spring in ephemeral streams. The spatial extent of bed material entrainment during floods was documented at seven gravel bars in three Puget Lowland streams using bed tags, which are metal washers placed in the stream bed. Partial entrainment (PEbar), which is the fraction of a bar's surface disturbed in a flood, was estimated by PEbar = 12. 5 (tau 0 * - 0. 045) with a root means square error of 0. 099, where tau 0 * is the total boundary shear stress applied by the flood divided by the product of the median of the particle-size distribution of the surface material on the gravel bar and its buoyant specific weight. Frequent and extensive flood disturbance is likely in urban and other gravel-bed streams where the magnitudes of floods are greater than the magnitude of longer-duration intermediate flows, represented by the discharge exceeded 5 % of the time, that control the strength of the stream bed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation on the use of forest roads as log transportation infrastructure at two logging companies in Jambi and one logging company in South Kalimantan carried out in 1990. The objective is to find out the information of the intensity of forest roads use as log transportation infrastructure. For that purpose, the data on forest road <b>length</b> (<b>km)</b> and actual log production (m 3) for the period of between three and ten years were collected. The results reveal that: 1. Forest roads at several forest companies in Sumatra and Kalimantan were commonly unpaved, and therefore, can only be used when they are dry. 2. The average lengths of forest roads built by A, B and C companies were 6. 050 km/year with the range of between 2. 000 and 13. 000 km/year; and 12. 733 km/year with the range of between 7. 600 and 19. 800 km/year; 11. 275 km /year with the range of between 2 : 565 and 22. 650 km /year, respectively. 3. Actual log production ranged from 18, 045, 48 to 45, 555. 60 m 3 /year with the average of 27, 249. 88 m 3 /year for A company; from 19, 484. 07 to 41, 526. 29 m 3 /year with the average of 31, 485. 36 m 3 /year for B company; and from 15, 892. 25 to 54, 553. 95 m 3 /year with the average of 36, 745. 30 m 3 /year for C company. 4.

40|$|International audienceWhich {{abiotic factors}} {{influence}} {{the number of}} native plant species on remote atolls is an important question to understand better the spatial pattern of the species observed on these low and vulnerable coral islands. However, this issue is still very poorly documented, often due to human degradation, partial botanical surveys or the difficult geographic access of remote atolls for researchers. The remote atolls of Eastern Polynesia, which {{are among the most}} isolated in the world, are of great interest for studies of native species’ distribution due to their isolation, low human density and urbanisation. In this study, we selected 49 remote atolls of Eastern Polynesia with complete botanical surveys to test the relative influence of eight abiotic factors on native plant species richness (i. e. indigenous and endemic species). Abiotic factors used as potential predictors included atoll area (km 2), shoreline <b>length</b> (<b>km),</b> atoll elevation (m) and index of isolation (UNEP), but also the coastal index of the atoll (Ic), the distance to the nearest similar atoll (km), the distance to the nearest large volcanic island ≥ 1000 km 2 (here, Tahiti as a potential stepping-stone island) and the distance to the nearest raised atoll ≥ 15 m a. s. l. (here, Makatea or Henderson as a potential refugium during sea-level highstands). Spearman’s rank correlation, linear regression analysis and frequency diagrams were used to assess the relative influence of these factors on native species richness. No relationship was found between the species richness and the index of isolation or the distance to the nearest similar atoll. Atoll area and distance to the nearest raised atoll of Makatea explained 47. 1 % and 40 %, respectively, of the native species richness variation observed on the remote atolls. The distance to the volcanic island of Tahiti and the coastal index explained 36. 9 % and 27. 3 % of the variation, while elevation and shoreline length explained 23. 3 % and 18. 4 % of the variation, respectively. Native species richness on the atolls surveyed increased with the increasing atoll area, elevation and shoreline length, but decreased with the increasing distance to the nearest raised atoll of Makatea and the large volcanic island of Tahiti. This supports the view that the spatial pattern of native species richness observed on the remote atolls was strongly influenced by (i) atoll area but also by (ii) the distance to the raised atoll of Makatea, and (iii) the distance to the volcanic island of Tahiti. This finding suggests that the raised atoll may be viewed as a refugium during sea-level highstands while the large volcanic island played the role of stepping-stone island, both islands influencing the dispersal of native species on remote atolls and attenuating the isolation effect in the study area...|$|E
