5|$|Archaeological <b>landscape</b> <b>features</b> include Bronze Age round barrows, {{extensive}} ancient field {{systems and}} Iron Age hill forts. Evidence from Roman times includes silver coins discovered in West Bagborough. The hills {{are now a}} peaceful area popular with walkers, mountain bikers, horse riders and tourists. They explore paths such as the Coleridge Way (the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived in Nether Stowey from 1797 to 1799) or visit places {{of interest in the}} surrounding villages.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{create a}} visual {{impact in the}} same way as do other <b>landscape</b> <b>features</b> and give a sense of {{maturity}} and permanence to park and garden. They are grown for the beauty of their forms, their foliage, flowers, fruit and bark and their siting is of major importance in creating a landscape. They can be grouped informally, often surrounded by plantings of bulbs, laid out in stately avenues or used as specimen trees. As living things, their appearance changes with the season and from year to year.|$|E
5|$|While {{awaiting}} the first delivery of stone, Simson {{noticed that the}} battlefield <b>landscape</b> <b>features</b> were beginning to deteriorate. Seeing an opportunity to not only preserve {{a portion of the}} battlefield but also keep his staff occupied, Simson decided to preserve a short section of trench line and make the Grange Subway more accessible. Labourers rebuilt and preserved sections of sandbagged trench wall, on both the Canadian and German sides of the Grange crater group, in concrete. The workforce also built a new concrete entrance for the Grange Subway and, after excavating a portion of the tunnel system, installed electric lighting.|$|E

50|$|The {{only known}} {{cultural}} {{resources on the}} reservation are the former cabin site and the original chimney still sitting atop the ridge. While {{it is an interesting}} <b>landscape</b> <b>feature,</b> this site has little historical or cultural significance either locally or regionally. To date, there have not been any efforts made to maintain the chimney as a <b>landscape</b> <b>feature.</b>|$|R
5|$|Zion National Park {{includes}} an elevated plateau {{that consists of}} sedimentary formations that dip very gently to the east. This means that the oldest strata are exposed along the Virgin River in the Zion Canyon part of the park, and the youngest are exposed in the Kolob Canyons section. The plateau is bounded on the east by the Sevier Fault Zone, and on the west by the Hurricane Fault Zone. Weathering and erosion along north-trending faults and fractures influence the formation of <b>landscape</b> <b>features,</b> such as canyons, in this region.|$|E
5|$|The Holderness {{landscape}} {{is dominated by}} deposits of till, boulder clays and glacial lake clays. These were deposited during the Devensian glaciation. The glacial deposits form {{a more or less}} continuous lowland plain which has some peat filled depressions (known locally as meres) which mark the presence of former lake beds. There are other glacial <b>landscape</b> <b>features</b> such as drumlin mounds, ridges and kettle holes scattered throughout the area. The well drained glacial deposits provide fertile soils that can support intensive arable cultivation. Fields are generally large and bounded by drainage ditches. There is very little woodland in the area and this leads to a landscape that is essentially rural but very flat and exposed.|$|E
5|$|The grounds {{include a}} gorge {{cut by the}} Hazel Brook through Bristol's limestone. The gorge {{has a number of}} <b>landscape</b> <b>features,</b> {{including}} Goram's Chair, a limestone outcrop often used by climbers, and Lover's Leap and Potter's Point, two panoramic viewing spots. Stratford Mill was moved from West Harptree and re-erected within the gorge after Chew Valley Lake was flooded to form a reservoir. Ongoing renovations started in 2004 of the mill, settling ponds and associated estate pathways. At the gorge's southern end, Hazel Brook joins the River Trym, which continues its flow towards Sea Mills. Other features within the estate include two pools: the Giant's Soapdish and the Penny Well, and two caves: the Robber's Cave and the Butcher's Cave.|$|E
50|$|The {{focus on}} green {{technologies}} {{has resulted in}} another <b>landscape</b> <b>feature,</b> the many windmills dotting the island.|$|R

5|$|The {{prospect}} of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism {{developments in the}} area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects {{have the potential to}} damage <b>landscape</b> <b>features.</b> Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems. It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a direct effect on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat. Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism. Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{legacy of}} the Auld Alliance, and the {{beginnings}} of the grand tour, meant that French styles were particularly important in Scotland, although adapted for the Scottish climate. From the late seventeenth century the gardens at Versailles, with their formal avenues, parterres and fountains that stressed symmetry and order, were a model. After the Glorious Revolution Dutch influences were also significant, with uniform planting and topiary. Gardening books from the continent and England became widely available in this period and the first gardening book published in Scotland, John Reid's, Scots Gard'ner (1683), borrowed from John Evelyn's (1658) translation of Nicholas de Bonnefon's Le Jardinair françois (1651), adapting its ideas for Scottish conditions. In the late seventeenth century William Bruce put Scotland at the forefront of European garden design, lowering garden walls to incorporate the surrounding countryside into the vista. This allowed a focus on significant <b>landscape</b> <b>features</b> such as Bass rock at Balcaskie and Loch Leven Castle at Kinross. Alexander Edward (1651–1708) continued in the tradition established by Bruce, adding landscapes at houses including Hamilton Palace and Kinnaird castle, Angus. Grand schemes in the French tradition included James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry (1662–1711) reworking of the terraces at Drumlanrig Castle, which incorporated the Douglas family crest into the parterres design, and the militaristic earthworks undertaken for Field Marshal John Dalrymple, 2nd Earl of Stair (1679–1747) at Castle Kennedy, Wigtownshire. Earl of Mar's (1675–1732) palace at Alloa was the grandest realisation of the Versailles style gardens in Scotland: it included canals, parterres, statues and ornamental trees.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s PWP and Ricardo Legorreta won a {{competition}} {{to design a}} new facility for a short-term intensified MBA program at the Stanford School of Business. A complex of spaces—including residential rooms, lecture facilities, and kitchen and dining areas—is softened by <b>landscape</b> <b>features</b> including a pool surrounded by willow and fern, a large grassed courtyard planted with dark green conifers, a formal palm court, and an orchard of pear trees.|$|E
25|$|Cave {{painting}} and rock carvings used simple visual elements {{that may have}} aided in recognizing <b>landscape</b> <b>features,</b> such as hills or dwellings. A map-like representation of a mountain, river, valleys and routes around Pavlov in the Czech Republic has been dated to 25,000 BC, and a 14,000 BC polished chunk of sandstone from a cave in Spanish Navarre may represent similar features superimposed on animal etchings, although it may also represent a spiritual landscape, or simple incisings.|$|E
25|$|The Connecticut River {{cuts through}} the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous {{metropolitan}} region centered within the state lies in the Connecticut River Valley. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern Litchfield Hills, it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the <b>landscape</b> <b>features</b> coastal marshes, beaches, and large scale maritime activities.|$|E
