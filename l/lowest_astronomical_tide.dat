50|$|Depths {{which have}} been {{measured}} are indicated by the numbers shown on the chart. Depths on charts published {{in most parts of}} the world use metres.

50|$|A {{different}} {{principle is}} used {{when choosing a}} datum for nautical charts. For safety reasons, a mariner {{must be able to}} know the minimum depth of water that could occur at any point. For this reason, depths and tides on a nautical chart are measured relative to chart datum, which is defined to be a level below which tide rarely falls. Exactly how this is chosen depends on the tidal regime in the area being charted and on the policy of the hydrographic office producing the chart in question; a typical definition is <b>Lowest</b> <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Tide</b> (the lowest tide predictable from the effects of gravity), or Mean Lower Low Water (the average lowest tide of each day), although MSL is sometimes used in waters with very low tidal ranges.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of modern methods of time-series analysis {{to a record}} of sea-level variation at Flint Cliff, Hamelin Pool, between October 1983 and April 1985, shows that <b>astronomical</b> <b>tides</b> account for {{only one of the}} following five key components of the record: a seasonal oceanic cycle; a short-term irregular cycle; the complex astronomical tidal system in the Pool; isolated major events; and less marked variations probably reflecting wind stress, still able to defeat the <b>astronomical</b> <b>tide</b> in the short-term. We have compared the inundation record with precisely surveyed elevation ranges of various microbial communities. The dominance of a seasonal cycle is the fundamental determinant of variation in the duration of immersion and exposure determining the littoral zonation of microbial mats in Hamelin Pool. The <b>astronomical</b> <b>tide</b> is not the major cause of this variation. The microbial communities fall into three zones. In Zone 3, the microbialiteforming colloform mat is virtually never exposed. In Zone 2, smooth, reticulate and mamillate mats colonise the lower littoral environment. Here, many of the exposed microbialites have been stranded by the falling sea level, and are colonised by intermittently submerged microbial communities that modify the stranded lithified microbialites. Zone 1 is inundated only under exceptional circumstances and microbial communities are ephemeral...|$|R
