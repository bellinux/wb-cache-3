5|$|As {{feathers}} grow at variable rates, these variations lead to visible {{dark and}} light bands in the fully formed feather. These so-called growth bars and their widths {{have been used to}} determine the daily nutritional status of birds. Each <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> bar correspond to around 24 hours and the use of this technique has been called ptilochronology (analogous to dendrochronology).|$|E
5|$|The Cassini–Huygens {{spacecraft}} reached Saturn on July 1, 2004, {{and began}} the process of mapping Titan's surface by radar. A joint project of the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, Cassini–Huygens proved a very successful mission. The Cassini probe flew by Titan on October 26, 2004, and took the highest-resolution images ever of Titan's surface, at only , discerning patches of <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> that would be invisible to the human eye.|$|E
5|$|Four bee {{families}} (Andrenidae, Colletidae, Halictidae, and Apidae) {{contain some}} {{species that are}} crepuscular. Most are tropical or subtropical, {{but there are some}} which live in arid regions at higher latitudes. These bees have greatly enlarged ocelli, which are extremely sensitive to <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark,</b> though incapable of forming images. Some have refracting superposition compound eyes: these combine the output of many elements of their compound eyes to provide enough light for each retinal photoreceptor. Their ability to fly by night enables them to avoid many predators, and to exploit flowers that produce nectar only or also at night.|$|E

5|$|Grasshoppers {{have the}} typical insect body plan of head, thorax and abdomen. The head is held {{vertically}} {{at an angle}} to the body, with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of compound eyes which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark,</b> and a pair of thread-like antennae that are sensitive to touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|Most insects, except {{some species}} of cave crickets, {{are able to}} {{perceive}} <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark.</b> Many species have acute vision capable of detecting minute movements. The eyes may include simple eyes or ocelli as well as compound eyes of varying sizes. Many species are able to detect light in the infrared, ultraviolet and the visible light wavelengths. Color vision has been demonstrated in many species and phylogenetic analysis suggests that UV-green-blue trichromacy existed from at least the Devonian period between 416 and 359 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} moth exists in both <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> colours in Great Britain, {{but during the}} industrial revolution, many of the trees on which the moths rested became blackened by soot, giving the dark-coloured moths an advantage in hiding from predators. This gave dark-coloured moths {{a better chance of}} surviving to produce dark-coloured offspring, and in just fifty years from the first dark moth being caught, nearly all of the moths in industrial Manchester were dark. The balance was reversed by the effect of the Clean Air Act 1956, and the dark moths became rare again, demonstrating the influence of natural selection on {{peppered moth}} evolution.|$|E

5|$|There are benches in {{the main}} aisle and confessionals in the side aisles. The confessionals {{contained}} benches until {{the closure of the}} church in 1938. After its reconstruction, the left side was reserved for women, and the right for men. Both side aisles are separated from the main aisle by pillar files, consisting of four columns and two half columns. The columns and the roof are painted in white, and the walls in cream. The floor is constructed from <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> grey marble slabs in a chequered pattern.|$|E
5|$|When {{suffering}} from sleep deprivation, active immunizations {{may have a}} diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production, and a lower immune response, than would be noted in a well-rested individual. Additionally, proteins such as NFIL3, which {{have been shown to}} be closely intertwined with both T-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms, can be affected through the disturbance of natural <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> cycles through instances of sleep deprivation, shift work, etc. As a result, these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{beliefs are}} one {{possible}} source {{for understanding the}} symbolism in the mysteries of Isis. J. Gwyn Griffiths, an Egyptologist and classical scholar, extensively studied Book 11 of Metamorphoses and its possible Egyptian background. He pointed out similarities between the first initiation in Metamorphoses and Egyptian afterlife beliefs, saying that the initiate took {{on the role of}} Osiris by undergoing symbolic death. In his view, the imagery of the initiation refers to the Egyptian underworld, the Duat. Griffiths argued that the sun {{in the middle of the}} night, in Lucius' account of the initiation, might have been influenced by the contrasts of <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> in other mystery rites, but it derived mainly from the depictions of the underworld in ancient Egyptian funerary texts. According to these texts, the sun god Ra passes through the underworld each night and unites with Osiris to emerge renewed, just as deceased souls do.|$|E

5|$|Link {{can travel}} from the Dark World to the Light World {{at almost any}} outside {{location}} by using the Magic Mirror, and can travel back to the Dark World again from the same location using a temporary portal left behind on the map {{at the point where}} he reappears in the Light World. Otherwise, Link must use hidden warp locations throughout the Light World to travel from the Light World to the Dark World. Travel between worlds allows for puzzles in A Link to the Past that exploit structural differences between the <b>Light</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dark</b> Worlds, as Link may travel to otherwise inaccessible areas in one world by warping from parallel but accessible locations in the other world.|$|E
5|$|One {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events in the game, on a floating continent hovering high above the surface of an unnamed planet, a technologically advanced civilization sought to harness the power of the four elemental crystals of light. They did not realize that they could not control such fundamental forces of nature. This power of light would have consumed the world itself had the light crystals not had their natural counterparts: the four dark elemental crystals. Disturbed by the sudden interruption of the careful balance between <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark,</b> four warriors were granted the power of the dark crystals to recapture the power of the light crystals. These so-called Dark Warriors succeeded in their quest, and restored harmony to the world. But their victory came too late to save the doomed civilization, whose culture was reduced to ruin, though their floating continent remained. On that continent, the circle of Gulgans, a race of blind soothsayers and fortune-tellers, predicted that these events will ultimately repeat.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata {{does not}} stalk at all {{species of the}} ant-mimic jumping spider genus Myrmarachne, and uses cryptic {{stalking}} only about 20% of the time against other ant-mimicking salticids and against beetle-mimicking salticids. P. fimbriata also sometimes does not use cryptic stalking against females of the salticid subfamily Lyssomaninae. These females are unusually translucent, and the translucent cuticle makes the anterior-median eyes (front-and-center) show <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> regions that flicker in and out when viewed head on. Lyssomanine males are not translucent and do not produce this flickering, and P. fimbriata uses cryptic stalking consistently against the males. This suggests that the flickering anterior-median eyes of lyssomanine females may reduce the ability of P. fimbriata to identify these females as jumping spiders.|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} of outer lip flare has sixteen low transverse ridges. The exterior {{surface of the}} shell varies between cream to pale yellowish-brown, with irregular, narrow <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>darker</b> bands. The body of these sea snails are brownish with black spots.|$|R
5|$|The Noronha skink {{is covered}} with <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> spots above, but there is {{substantial}} variation in the precise colors. There are no longitudinal stripes. The scales on the underparts are yellowish or grayish. The eyelids are white to yellow. It has a small head with small nostrils, which are placed far to the front {{at the sides of}} the head. The mouth contains small and conical teeth and a thin but well-developed tongue. The eyes are small and placed laterally and contain dark, rounded irises. There are three to five well-developed auricular lobules (small projections) in front of the ears; these lobules are absent in true Mabuya. The hindlimbs are longer and stronger than the forelimbs, which are small. The tail is longer than the body and is muscular but very brittle. It is nearly cylindrical in form and tapers towards the end.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} and pelvic fins are {{broad and}} rounded and are thickly muscled. The two similarly-sized dorsal fins are placed well {{back on the}} body. The anal fin is low and positioned {{just in front of}} the caudal fin. The caudal fin has only an upper lobe, which contains a prominent ventral notch near the tip and is angled almost horizontally relative to the body. Adult epaulette sharks are beige to brownish above with many widely spaced brown spots and subtle darker bands. There is a very large black spot ringed in white located behind each pectoral fin; this pair of spots are the origin of this shark's common name. Juveniles have alternating <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> bands over their body and fins, which break up as they mature. Epaulette sharks are typically 7090cm (2735 in) long; the maximum reported length is 107cm (42in).|$|E
5|$|The primary uniform (jersey, {{shorts and}} socks) is red with {{alternating}} lighter and darker horizontal bands, black sleeves with red trim, and a vertical black band below each sleeve extending {{the full length}} of the jersey. The secondary uniform includes white jerseys with a large red horizontal band below a smaller blue band across the chest with blue and red trim, white socks with blue trim, and with either red or blue shorts (the choice of which is subject to the opponent uniform). In its first three seasons, Toronto FC's secondary uniform colours were <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> grey. In the following four seasons the team wore white secondary uniforms, whereas in 2014, the secondary uniforms were changed to onyx. As with all MLS teams, the uniforms are produced by Adidas. In 2013 and 2014, a shadow-print maple leaf was featured on Toronto FC's primary jerseys.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} types of Force powers; light, dark and neutral. Light Force powers provide nonviolent {{advantages}} such as being able to restore health or persuade enemies to ignore the player. Dark Force powers are violent and give the ability to throw objects or choke enemies. Neutral powers enhance athletic abilities such as being able to jump higher or run faster. There are fourteen powers in total, four of each type and a bonus power in each <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> if the Jedi stays true to that path. Players earn stars to allocate toward Force powers by completing specific levels. By finding all the secrets in a level, players can also gain one bonus star to use. Between levels, the player can choose which Force powers to enhance by allocating stars to that power. Stars cannot be reclaimed from powers later on.|$|E
5|$|Time is also {{connected}} {{to the theme of}} <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark.</b> In Shakespeare's day, plays were most often performed at noon or in the afternoon in broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words to create the illusion of day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion. He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to the illusion of its passage.|$|E
5|$|Titan was {{examined}} by both Voyager 1 and 2 in 1980 and 1981, respectively. Voyager 1s trajectory {{was designed to}} provide an optimized Titan flyby, during which the spacecraft was able to determine the density, composition, and temperature of the atmosphere, and obtain a precise measurement of Titan's mass. Atmospheric haze prevented direct imaging of the surface, though in 2004 intensive digital processing of images taken through Voyager 1s orange filter did reveal hints of the <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> features now known as Xanadu and Shangri-la, which had been observed in the infrared by the Hubble Space Telescope. Voyager 2, {{which would have been}} diverted to perform the Titan flyby if Voyager 1 had been unable to, did not pass near Titan and continued on to Uranus and Neptune.|$|E
