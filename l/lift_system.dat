40|$|Abstract. Holding {{the work}} piece for the forging press is the main task of the forging manipulator, and it is {{recognized}} as one of industry’s most arduous tasks. To ensure the safety of the manipulator mechanism, the resistance force exerted on the clamp must be minimized [1]. This paper focuses on the vertical load analysis of <b>lifting</b> <b>systems</b> for the forging manipulator when it works in cooperation with the forging press. First the equivalent stiffness model of {{the work piece}} is presented and the loads of the <b>lifting</b> <b>systems</b> are derived. Then the hydraulic circuits of the front and the rear <b>lifting</b> <b>systems</b> are investigated. Finally, the whole forging process is analyzed to study the relationship between the tracking error of the <b>lifting</b> <b>systems</b> and the resistance force on them. Simulation of one typical forging process shows that the cause of resistance force on the <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> is the displacement tracking error...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT – The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to design the water <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> which is of human operated. In all over the world there are various types of water <b>lifting</b> <b>systems</b> currently in use. Some are electrically operated and some of them are mechanically operated and some are still traditional way of system. In India there are some basic types of water <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> still in use such as Hand Pump, rope well. It can be use in everywhere but it need more manual power. Now electrically water <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> is also in use. But drawback is electricity is costly and hence not efficient to use. Some of manual operated system is use like Traddle Pump and many other types of system using, but the design of this system is more critical and maintainance cost is high. The many water <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> is not portable and does not reach the maximum height and also the rate of discharge is less. Other drawback is it is not easily availability of the spare parts once get damaged. Hence in this preview paper we are considering the all above points and proposed the new design concept of bicycle powered water <b>lifting</b> <b>system.</b> It is in simple in design and portable...|$|R

25|$|The CALF was a DARPA {{program to}} develop a STOVL strike fighter (SSF) for the United States Marine Corps and {{replacement}} for the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The United States Air Force passed over the F-16 Agile Falcon in the late 1980s, essentially an enlarged F-16, and continued to mull other designs. In 1992, the Marine Corps and Air Force agreed to jointly develop the Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter, also known as Advanced Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (ASTOVL). CALF project was chosen after Paul Bevilaqua persuaded the Air Force that his team's concept (if stripped of its <b>lift</b> <b>system)</b> had potential as a complement to the F-22 Raptor.

25|$|The caisson lock can however be powered, and the caisson lifted, by {{buoyancy}} alone. Pumping {{ballast water}} {{in and out}} of the caisson is enough to float it up or down the lock chamber. The weight of ballast water is approximately that of the canal barge being lifted. The boat lift though needs a mechanical <b>lift</b> <b>system.</b> In most vertical lift systems, this must also lift or lower the weight of the caisson and its water contents as well. This is substantially more than the barge alone, and the power to lift it is supplied mechanically. At the time of their development, the steam engine was in its infancy. Steam engines had been developed as water pumps, but not yet for the supply of mechanical power (see rotative steam engine). Given the engineering constraints of the time, lifting an enclosed caisson by buoyancy was more practical than driving a boat lift.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{discovery}} {{was that the}} total amount of air needed to lift the craft was a function of the roughness of the surface it traveled over. On flat surfaces, like pavement, the needed air pressure was so low that hovercraft were able to compete in energy terms with conventional systems like steel wheels. However, as the hovercraft <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> acted as both a lift and very effective suspension, it naturally lent itself to high-speed use where conventional suspension systems were considered too complex. This led to a variety of [...] "hovertrain" [...] proposals during the 1960s, including England's Tracked Hovercraft and France's Aérotrain. In the U.S., Rohr Inc. and Garrett both took out licenses to develop local versions of the Aérotrain. These designs competed with maglev systems in the high-speed arena, where their primary advantage was the very [...] "low tech" [...] tracks they needed. On the downside, the air blowing dirt and trash out from under the trains presented a unique problem in stations, and interest in them waned in the 1970s.|$|E
