40|$|In {{order to}} develop a high spatial {{resolution}} (micron level) thermal neutron detector, a detector assembly composed of cerium doped <b>lithium</b> <b>glass</b> microfibers, each with a diameter of 1 μm, is proposed, where the neutron absorption location is reconstructed from the observed charged particle products that result from neutron absorption. To suppress the cross talk of the scintillation light, each scintillating fiber is surrounded by air-filled glass capillaries with the same diameter as the fiber. This pattern is repeated to form a bulk microfiber detector. On one end, {{the surface of the}} detector is painted with a thin optical reflector to increase the light collection efficiency at the other end. Then the scintillation light emitted by any neutron interaction is transmitted to one end, magnified, and recorded by an intensified CCD camera. A simulation based on the Geant 4 toolkit was developed to model this detector. All the relevant physics processes including neutron interaction, scintillation, and optical boundary behaviors are simulated. This simulation was first validated through measurements of neutron response from <b>lithium</b> <b>glass</b> cylinders. With good expected light collection, an algorithm based upon the features inherent to alpha and triton particle tracks is proposed to reconstruct the neutron reaction position in the glass fiber array. Given a 1 μm fiber diameter and 0. 1 mm detector thickness, the neutron spatial resolution is expected to reach σ∼ 1 μm with a Gaussian fit in each lateral dimension. The detection efficiency was estimated to be 3. 7 % for a glass fiber assembly with thickness of 0. 1 mm.

A new {{effective way to}} enhance the transmission of the ultracold neutrons through guides is demonstrated. This method involves internally coating stainless steel guide tubes with deuterated polystyrene using a spinning method, or with Fomblin oil. Results show that the UCN transmission in one metre is increased from about 37 % for the honed only guide tubes to about 84 % and 88 % when coated internally with deuterated polystyrene or with Fomblin oil respectively. The enhancement in the guide tube surface quality due to the electropolishing process resulted in increasing the UCN transmission rate for the honed tube from 37 % to about 81 %. So coating a honed only tube with deuterated polystyrene or with Fomblin oil gave better transmission rates than electropolishing the tube and not coating it. The transmission measurements are for neutrons with an average axial velocity of about 9. 2 m s"-" 1.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{understanding}} of Li-dynamics in oxide glasses, i. e. the effect of [AlO 4](-) tetrahedra and non-bridging oxygens on the potential landscape, electrical conductivity of seven fully polymerized and partly depolymerized <b>lithium</b> aluminosilicate <b>glasses</b> was investigated using impedance spectroscopy (IS). Lithium is the only mobile particle in these materials. Data derived from IS, i. e. activation energies, preexponential factors and diffusivities for lithium, are interpreted in light of Raman spectroscopic analyses of local structures {{in order to identify}} building units, which are crucial for lithium dynamics and migration. In polymerized glasses (compositional join LiAlSiO 4 -LiAlSi 4 O 10) the direct current (DC) electrical conductivity continuously increases with increasing lithium content while lithium diffusivity is not affected by the Al/ Si ratio in the glasses. Hence, the increase in electrical conductivity can be solely assigned to lithium concentration in the glasses. An excess of Li with respect to Al, i. e. the introduction of non-bridging oxygen into the network, causes a decrease in lithium mobility in the glasses. Activation energies in polymerized glasses (66 to 70 kJ mol(- 1)) are significantly lower than those in depolymerized networks (76 to 78 kJ mol(- 1)) while pre-exponential factors are nearly constant across all compositions. Comparison of the data with results for lithium silicates from the literature indicates a minimum in <b>lithium</b> diffusivity for <b>glasses</b> containing both aluminium tetrahedra and non-bridging oxygens. The findings allow a prediction of DC conductivity for a large variety of <b>lithium</b> aluminosilicate <b>glass</b> compositions. DFG/FOR/ 1277 DFG/FOR/ 127...|$|R
40|$|The Li {{environment}} {{has been determined}} in a <b>Lithium</b> diborate <b>glass</b> by using neutron diffraction with isotopic substitution of Li. In the first difference function, oscillations are discernible up to 20 Å− 1. Li appears in a strongly distorted tetrahedral site, with an average Li–O distance of 1. 99 Å. A second peak at 2. 96 Å is assigned to Li–B correlations and indicates dominant connections by corners between the Li polyhedra and the borate units...|$|R
40|$|Two {{series of}} glasses, (Li 2 O) x(P 2 O 5) 1 -x and (LiCl) y((Li 2 O) 0. 4 (P 2 O 5) 0. 6) 1 -y were {{prepared}} by ordinary melt-quench technique. The range of x is from 0. 1 to 0. 5 with interval of 0. 05 {{and the range}} of y is from 0. 1 to 0. 5 with interval of 0. 1. The ultrasonic velocities for both series of glasses were measured at room temperature by using pulse echo technique at 10 MHz. The velocity data have been used to estimate the elastic modulus and Debye temperature for each composition. The density of Li 2 O-P 2 O 5 glasses increases with the addition of Li 2 O but LiCl-Li 2 O-P 2 O 5 glasses shows the trend of decrement when the mole fraction of LiCl increases. The longitudinal, shear, bulk and Young’s modulus for <b>lithium</b> phosphate <b>glasses</b> are found to increase with the addition of Li 2 O whereas the elastic moduli for <b>lithium</b> chlorophosphate <b>glasses</b> are found to decrease with the concentration of LiCl; these kind of characteristics are due to the variation of ultrasonic waves in different glass structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} between structure and electrical properties of nitrided <b>lithium</b> phosphate <b>glasses</b> (LiPON) used as electrolytes for lithium batteries are key issues for better understanding {{and design of}} these materials. For the first time, the effect of nitrogen introduction {{in the structure of}} <b>lithium</b> phosphorus oxynitride <b>glasses,</b> formulated over a wide range of composition 38 - 55 mol. % of Li 2 O, has been studied through 31 P 1 D/ 2 D MAS NMR experiments. Information obtained from 2 D 31 P/ 31 P correlation maps has been used to deconvolute the 1 D 31 P NMR spectra and allowed establishing the percentage of oxide phosphate groups (PO 4) and phosphorus species with nitrogen (P(O,N) 4) as well as the connectivity scheme of the phosphate network. Finally, it has been demonstrated that the lithium content affects the structural changes induced by the introduction of nitrogen. In particular, the lower the lithium content is, the lower the total percentage of nitrided P(O,N) 4 species is...|$|R
