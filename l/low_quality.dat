5|$|Red Cloud {{decided to}} return to the {{military}} in 1948. He enlisted in the United States Army and was assigned to E Company, 2nd Battalion, 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division. The regiment was part of the Occupation of Japan, and Red Cloud was assigned to Kyushu. During this time, training opportunities were limited, many of the troops were inexperienced and their equipment was of <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> due to budget cuts. On joining the army, Red Cloud was not permitted to retain his sergeant rank from the Marine Corps.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{at the end}} of the 14th century, {{no doubt}} on account of the devastation caused mid-century by the Black Death, there was a general shift towards less {{expensive}} techniques. Many things which would have earlier been completely forbidden by the guilds were now commonplace (using <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> wool, carding, etc.). In the silk industry, the use of water-powered mills grew, and by the 15th century, the loom designed by Jean le Calabrais saw nearly universal use.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced {{each other across the}} Rhine. Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance (Bodensee) to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Overall, almost 36,000residences {{were damaged}} {{as a result}} of Catarina's onslaught; of those, 993 {{collapsed}} completely. The commercial sector fared slightly better, as only 2,274buildings were damaged and 472 collapsed. Finally, 397public buildings were damaged and three were destroyed. These account for 26% of the total buildings in the region, and property damage of $25.6million (2004 USD $ USD). Four-fifths of the damaged houses had some sort of roof failure or collapse. Most of the damage was blamed on the <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> of the construction; brick residences typically lacked plaster, beams, or columns, for example. The areas affected the most were those inhabited by low-income families, usually with annual family salaries of less than $400USD.|$|E

5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Stéphane Sednaoui, brought even more mainstream success {{to the band}} through repeated airplay on MTV. The video debuted in September 1993. It was shot with <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> photographic equipment, which, like several other early Pumpkins videos, was an intentional stylistic decision. Corgan said that {{the plot of the}} video was inspired by a memory he had of an ice cream truck driver who, upon quitting his job, gave out his remaining stock of ice cream to the neighborhood children. This image was then melded with Sednaoui's own sensibilities inspired by the film Zabriskie Point. The video is available on The Smashing Pumpkins – Greatest Hits Video Collection (1991–2000) DVD, released in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} also disproved {{claims that}} some {{deterioration in the}} quality of the gunpowder would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in a heap and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating for the quality of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up {{from the top of the}} barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed double the amount needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the music {{produced}} by the movement and its passage from underground phenomenon to mainstream genre, prompted its main promoter Geoff Barton to declare the NWOBHM finished in 1981. He felt disappointed by the <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> of the new bands and frustrated by {{the ease with which}} record labels exploited enthusiasm for heavy metal. Coincidentally, in the same year, the Bandwagon was closed and the Prince of Wales pub was subsequently demolished to build a restaurant. Although the movement had lost some of its appeal for diehard fans, as evidenced by the increased popularity of American-influenced AOR releases on sales-based national polls, it retained enough vitality to launch a second wave of bands, which rose from the underground and released their first albums in 1982 and 1983.|$|E

5|$|Three major {{problems}} persisted, leading to motion pictures and sound recording largely taking separate paths for a generation. The primary issue was synchronization: pictures and sound were recorded and played back by separate devices, which {{were difficult to}} start and maintain in tandem. Sufficient playback volume was also hard to achieve. While motion picture projectors soon allowed film to be shown to large theater audiences, audio technology before the development of electric amplification could not project satisfactorily to fill large spaces. Finally, there was the challenge of recording fidelity. The primitive systems of the era produced sound of very <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> unless the performers were stationed {{directly in front of}} the cumbersome recording devices (acoustical horns, for the most part), imposing severe limits on the sort of films that could be created with live-recorded sound.|$|E
5|$|Tinne {{acquired}} a significant collection of clothes from shops in Bold Street, Liverpool shops and her local dressmaker. The collection comprised both off-the-rail items and bespoke outfits. She also made some clothes, including special outfits for her children's dance shows. The collection {{is held by}} National Museums Liverpool, donated in three stages by Emily Tinne's daughter, Alexine. Due to {{the sheer volume of}} items, Alexine would put out two tea chests per week, which would be collected by the museum. The collection includes more than 700 items, though many other items could not be accepted due to the <b>low</b> <b>quality.</b> The total collection included over 1000 items. The collection is the largest from an individual owned by a museum in the United Kingdom.|$|E

Though excited at first, Jerry later realizes how intrusive Elaine might become, and that living with her might get annoying. He discusses his problem with George, but the topic of their conversation changes and they eventually talk about wearing a wedding ring to a party, to see how women will react. George dislikes the idea at first, but eventually borrows one from Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) to experiment.|$|E
