5|$|Galerina marginata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, obtaining nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. It {{is known to}} have most of the major classes of secreted enzymes that dissolve plant cell wall polysaccharides, and {{has been used as a}} model saprobe in recent studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Because of its variety of enzymes capable of breaking down wood and other <b>lignocellulosic</b> materials, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is currently sequencing its genome. The fungus is typically reported to grow on or near the wood of conifers, although it has been observed to grow on hardwoods as well. Fruit bodies may grow solitarily, but more typically in groups or small clusters, and appear in the summer to autumn. Sometimes, they may grow on buried wood and thus appear to be growing on soil.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} time {{required}} for anaerobic digestion depends on the chemical complexity of the material. Material rich in easily digestible sugars breaks down quickly where as intact <b>lignocellulosic</b> material rich in cellulose and hemicellulose polymers can take much longer to break down. Anaerobic microorganisms are generally unable to break down lignin, the recalcitrant aromatic component of biomass.|$|E
25|$|THF {{has been}} {{explored}} as a miscible co-solvent {{in aqueous solution}} {{to aid in the}} liquefaction and delignification of plant <b>lignocellulosic</b> biomass for production of renewable platform chemicals and sugars as potential precursors to biofuels. Aqueous THF augments the hydrolysis of glycans from biomass and dissolves the majority of biomass lignin making it a suitable solvent for biomass pretreatment.|$|E
40|$|Agro-based {{resources}}, also referrered to as <b>lignocellulosics,</b> are {{resources that}} contain cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. <b>Lignocellulosics</b> include wood, agricultural residues, water plants, grasses, and other plant substances.

30|$|Among {{the various}} types of biomass, <b>lignocellulosics</b> such as wood account for more than 90  % of the biomass in the world. <b>Lignocellulosics</b> are {{renewable}} and do not compete with food resources. To produce various useful materials from <b>lignocellulosics,</b> methods such as acid hydrolysis [1], enzymatic saccharification [2], pyrolysis [3, 4] and supercritical fluid treatment [5] have been studied. These methods, however, require severe conditions for treatment such as high temperatures and high pressures.|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview options for converting <b>lignocellulosics</b> into fermentable sugars in CELSS. A requirement for pretreatment is shown. Physical-chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis processes for producing fermentable sugars are discussed. At present physical-chemical methods are the simplest and best characterized options, but enzymatic processes will be the likely method of choice in the future. The use of pentose sugars by microorganisms to produce edibles is possible. The use of mycelial food production on pretreated but not hydrolyzed <b>lignocellulosics</b> is also possible. Simple trade-off analyses to regenerate waste <b>lignocellulosics</b> for two pathways are made, {{one of which is}} compared to complete oxidation...|$|R
25|$|Dimethyl ether {{is being}} {{developed}} as a synthetic second generation biofuel (BioDME), which can be manufactured from <b>lignocellulosic</b> biomass. Currently the EU is considering BioDME in its potential biofuel mix in 2030; the Volvo Group is the coordinator for the European Community Seventh Framework Programme project BioDME where Chemrec's BioDME pilot plant based on black liquor gasification is nearing completion in Piteå, Sweden.|$|E
25|$|This {{has both}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages. The advantage is that, unlike with regular food crops, no arable land is used {{solely for the}} production of fuel. The disadvantage is that unlike with regular food crops, it may be rather difficult to extract the fuel. For instance, a series of physical and chemical treatments might be required to convert <b>lignocellulosic</b> biomass to liquid fuels suitable for transportation.|$|E
25|$|In {{industrial}} production, some <b>lignocellulosic</b> residue remains {{after the}} removal of the furfural. This residue is dried and burned to provide steam for the operation of the furfural plant. Newer and more energy efficient plants have excess residue, which is or can be used for co-generation of electricity, cattle feed, activated carbon, mulch/fertiliser, etc. It also {{has been used as a}} glue extender in the North American board industry.|$|E
30|$|In recent times, several {{energy and}} {{environmental}} problems such as fossil resource exhaustion and global warming have become more serious. To overcome such problems, biomass has been focused as an alternative resource because of its reproductivity and carbon neutrality. Among the various biomass types, <b>lignocellulosics</b> are a promising resource because of the huge feedstock available {{and because they are}} unrelated to the food supply. The development of new conversion technologies is indispensable to ensure the effective exploitation of <b>lignocellulosics.</b> Much research has been conducted on various conversions of <b>lignocellulosics</b> such as acid hydrolysis [1], enzymatic saccharification [2], pyrolysis [3, 4], and supercritical fluid treatment [5]. However, efficient methods have not been established yet.|$|R
30|$|In recent times, several {{energy and}} {{environmental}} problems from using fossil resources have been identified. To solve these problems, and establish a sustainable society based on renewable resources, efficient utilization of biomass is indispensable. Among various types of biomass, <b>lignocellulosics</b> are most abundant, and do not compete with food resources. To produce various useful materials from <b>lignocellulosics,</b> some methods such as acid hydrolysis [1], enzymatic saccharification [2], pyrolysis [3, 4] and supercritical fluid treatment [5] have been studied.|$|R
30|$|Zhao et al. [16] studied {{reaction}} systems {{using the}} ionic liquid 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([EMIM]Cl), with chromium (II) chloride (CrCl 2) as a catalyst. This system enabled {{the conversion of}} glucose into 5 -HMF with yields of 70  mol%, and their results have encouraged conversion of disaccharides, cellulose, and <b>lignocellulosics</b> to 5 -HMF in ionic liquids [17 – 22]. These studies suggest that 5 -HMF can be produced from <b>lignocellulosics</b> without requiring preprocessing steps, such as delignification and hydrolysis.|$|R
25|$|Pyrolysis oil {{is another}} type of fuel derived from the <b>lignocellulosic</b> {{fraction}} of biomass. By rapidly heating biomass {{in the absence of}} oxygen (pyrolysis), a liquid crude can be formed that can be further processed into a usable bio-oil. As opposed to other biofuels, pyrolysis oils use the non-edible fraction of biomass and can occur on the order of milliseconds and without the need for large fermentation reactors. This same reaction is known to have come from harvesting unicorn blood (although very hard to find).|$|E
25|$|The primary endosymbionts {{are thought}} to help the host either by {{providing}} nutrients that the host cannot obtain itself or by metabolizing insect waste products into safer forms. For example, the putative primary role of Buchnera is to synthesize essential amino acids that the aphid cannot acquire from its natural diet of plant sap. Likewise, the primary role of Wigglesworthia, it is presumed, is to synthesize vitamins that the tsetse fly does not get from the blood that it eats. In lower termites, the endosymbiotic protists {{play a major role}} in the digestion of <b>lignocellulosic</b> materials that constitute a bulk of the termites' diet.|$|E
25|$|Biomass is {{biological}} material derived from living, or recently living organisms. It most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called <b>lignocellulosic</b> biomass. As an energy source, biomass {{can either be}} used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel. Conversion of biomass to biofuel {{can be achieved by}} different methods which are broadly classified into: thermal, chemical, and biochemical methods. Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today; examples include forest residues – such as dead trees, branches and tree stumps –, yard clippings, wood chips and even municipal solid waste. In the second sense, biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial chemicals, including biofuels. Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants, including miscanthus, switchgrass, hemp, corn, poplar, willow, sorghum, sugarcane, bamboo, and a variety of tree species, ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm (palm oil).|$|E
30|$|The {{liquefaction}} of Japanese beech (Fagus crenata Blume) was {{studied with}} various straight-chain alcohols in subcritical and supercritical states using a batch-type reaction vessel to obtain liquid fuel from <b>lignocellulosics.</b> Under the reaction condition of 270 °C, beech wood was liquefied {{to some extent}} in all alcohols with about 50 %– 65 % insoluble residue left after treatment for 30 min. Under the condition of 350 °C, however, more than 90 % of wood was decomposed and liquefied in all alcohols. Alcohols with longer alkyl chains liquefied <b>lignocellulosics</b> in shorter reaction times. Because many kinds of alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol, can be produced from biomass, 100 % biomass-based liquid fuel can be prepared by supercritical alcohol technology when using such bioalcohols.|$|R
40|$|<b>Lignocellulosics</b> {{represent}} a renewable resource for producing fuels and chemicals {{as an alternative}} to fossil resources. This study utilised an organic acid catalyst and a co-solvent to develop an environmentally friendly processing technology for the production of levulinic acid and furfural from a waste material, sugarcane fibre...|$|R
40|$|The {{energy needs}} are {{increasing}} rapidly throughout the world. To fulfill this need, new {{environmentally friendly energy}} sources must be developed. Production of bio-ethanol from <b>lignocellulosics,</b> a renewable resource, has a favorable life cycle compared to actual fossil fuels or to bio-ethanol from starch. The main difficulty is to obtain the sugars from the rigid cellulose matrix characteristic of <b>lignocellulosics.</b> The sugars would then be fermented into ethanol. Scientists generally follow two approaches to develop the sugar production process from <b>lignocellulosics,</b> (1) acid hydrolysis and (2) enzymatic hydrolysis. Both approaches produce high glucose recoveries; however, both processes have been, so far, economically unattractive and rely, as the corn-linked process, on subsidies. This project attempts to develop improved methods that make the sugar production from <b>lignocellulosics</b> economically attractive. The acid hydrolysis process {{is based on the}} ASTM E 1758 - 95 method, referred to as"Determination of carbohydrates in biomass by HPLC". Our innovation has been to modify the"swelling" and hydrolysis steps inherent in the ASTM method, by using a mediator to produce a more concentrated solution of sugars. The experiment presented in this thesis proves that that proposed innovation is technically feasible. However, the economical feasibility of our innovation hinges upon the recovery and recycling of the acid and mediator. The enzymatic hydrolysis innovation is based on using the substrates produced by steam treatment and evaluating whether or not their enzymatic hydrolysis is preferred (less enzymes and less time) over processes with pre-treated but non-fractionated substrates or in relation to high-purity cellulose as the ultimate standard. Our research shows that time and enzymatic loading are the main factors controlling the hydrolysis. When compared with these two factors, the type of substrate has little effect on enzymatic hydrolysis. From this information, it can be deduced that crystallinity is the key limiting step and barrier to enzymatic activity...|$|R
2500|$|These sugars may be {{obtained}} from hemicellulose present in <b>lignocellulosic</b> biomass, which can be extracted from most terrestrial plants.|$|E
2500|$|Whereas first {{generation}} biofuels {{are made from}} the sugars and vegetable oils found in arable crops, second generation biofuels are made from <b>lignocellulosic</b> biomass or woody crops, agricultural residues or waste plant material (from food crops) ...|$|E
2500|$|Second {{generation}} biofuels use <b>lignocellulosic</b> {{raw material}} such as forest residues (sometimes {{referred to as}} brown waste and black liquor from Kraft process or sulfite process pulp mills). Third generation biofuels (biofuel from algae) use non-edible raw materials sources {{that can be used}} for biodiesel and bioethanol.|$|E
30|$|Enzymatic {{saccharification}} {{is one of}} {{the methods}} to convert mushroom cultural wastes into sugars. It has some merits, such as substrate specificity, lower energy consumption, and environmental safety. However, enzymatic saccharification of <b>lignocellulosics,</b> such as wood meal, is ineffective because lignin surrounding cellulose prevents the enzymes from accessing cellulose.|$|R
40|$|Predicted {{increases}} in greenhouse gas emissions, depleting fossil fuel supplies, global conflicts, and energy security are major factors driving {{the search for}} renewable energy supplies. Based on future energy demand projections, biofuels production is expected to increase. However, this increase represents {{a small fraction of}} this growing demand because the land area required to grow sufficient biofuels crops is unavailable. Hence, fulfilling the growing energy demand after attaining peak fossil fuel production will include using a combination of energy sources such as renewables, wind, geothermal, nuclear, hydroelectric, solar, and coal. Current and potential feedstocks include grains, grasses, root crops, oil seeds, algae, and <b>lignocellulosics.</b> Grains, sugar crops, and <b>lignocellulosics</b> are the main feedstocks used in full-scale first- and second-generation ethanol processes. While first-generation biodiesel is produced mainly from corn, soybeans, canola oil, rapeseed, palm oil, Jatropha, and coconut oil, second-generation fuels are produced from <b>lignocellulosics.</b> Third-generation technology employs several processes to produce a variety of biofuels from algae while fourth-generation technologies, a developing concept, is intended to employ genetically modified terrestrial or aquatic plants. In another concept, fourth-generation technologies can be configured with CO 2 sequestration and storage. First-generation biobutanol is produced from corn or molasses and from sugar beet as well as sugarcane, while second-generation production processes utilize <b>lignocellulosics</b> such as corn stover, rice straw, corn fiber, switchgrass, alfalfa, reed canary grass, sugarcane bagasse, Miscanthus, waste paper, dry distillers grain with solubles (DDGS), and soy molasses. A variety of technologies, based on the enzyme systems, are currently under investigation for producing biohydrogen. Biohydrogen production routes are divided into biophotolysis (direct/indirect), dark fermentation, and photofermentation. Increasing global demand is expected to drive increasing bioethanol and biobutanol production using food and nonfood feedstocks. At the same time, researchers are developing technologies to produce biohydrogen and biodiesel. Biohydrogen and biodiesel production technologies are in their developmental stages; however, with innovation, these technologies are expected to mature into economical processes...|$|R
30|$|This {{study was}} carried out to produce {{bioethanol}} from sugarcane bagasse using bacterial isolates from agro-waste-impacted soils. The bagasse served as substrates for the bacterial cultures used in the fermentation process. Sugarcane bagasse {{is an example of}} <b>lignocellulosics</b> and can be converted to bioethanol following pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation by appropriate microorganisms (Sarkar et al. 2012).|$|R
2500|$|Cellulosic-ethanol {{manufacturing}} plants {{are bound to}} be net exporters of electricity because {{a large portion of the}} <b>lignocellulosic</b> biomass, namely lignin, remains undigested and it must be burned, thus producing electricity for the plant and excess electricity for the grid. [...] As the market grows and this technology becomes more widespread, coupling the liquid fuel and the electricity markets will become more and more difficult.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011–2013, BP {{cut down}} its {{alternative}} energy business. The company announced its {{departure from the}} solar energy market in December 2011 by closing its solar power business, BP Solar. In 2012, BP shut down the BP Biofuels Highlands project which was developed since 2008 to make cellulosic ethanol from emerging energy crops like switchgrass and from biomass. [...] In 2015, BP decided to exit from other <b>lignocellulosic</b> ethanol businesses. [...] It sold its stake in Vivergo to Associated British Foods. [...] BP and DuPont also mothballed their joint biobutanol pilot plant in Saltend.|$|E
2500|$|Mycena cystidiosa is a {{saprobic}} fungus—meaning it obtains nutrients {{by breaking}} down decomposing plant organic matter. Although the mushrooms are usually found on fallen leaves, it also grows on wood, utilising the small branch litter common to eucalypt forests. The species may contain the enzymes necessary for decomposing <b>lignocellulosic</b> biomass. It {{is found in}} New Zealand, southwestern Australia, and Tasmania. Australian mycologist Bruce Fuhrer calls it [...] "possibly our tallest Mycena". The mushrooms generally fruit from April to June. In a study of post-fire succession in a Eucalyptus regnans forest, researchers found that M.cystidiosa appeared in the third of three phases of recolonization, {{more than seven years}} after the burn. Other mycenas often found in this [...] "mature" [...] phase include M.austrofilopes, M.austrororida, and M.interrupta.|$|E
30|$|Bacterial enzymes {{involved}} in degradation of hemicellulases {{have also been}} the focus of several studies. Many bacterial strains like Bacillus circulans, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Clostridium thermocellum, Thermobacillus xylanolyticus, Bacillus subtilis, Dictyoglomus thermophillus, and Streptomyces halstedi are found to be sources of hemicellulases [28]. A glycoside hydrolase family 43 (GH 43) from Clostridium thermocellum showing hemicellulase activity, along with its further use in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process has been described [32]. Commercial development of hemicellulases for enzymatic hydrolysis of <b>lignocellulosics</b> is not as advanced as cellulases because current commercial preparations have been primarily on dilute acid pretreated biomass where hemicellulose is removed before saccharification [34]. However, if the pretreatment is non-acidic, where the hemicellulose fraction remains intact, hemicellulases are required. Current cellulases tend to have weak hemicellulase activity and are not adequate for the complete conversion of hemicellulose fraction of <b>lignocellulosics.</b> Development of low cost, commercial hemicellulases that work synergistically with cellulases is {{one of the goals of}} the current research activities.|$|R
30|$|Recently, much {{attention}} has been paid to ionic liquid treatment as an attractive and novel technology for the conversion of <b>lignocellulosics.</b> Ionic liquids are organic salts having low melting points around ambient temperature. They can be easily modified by changing the structure of the cation and/or anion, which broadens their applications. Because of their negligible vapor pressure, non-flammability, and recyclability, ionic liquids are regarded as “green solvents”. Since Swatloski et al. [6] revealed that some imidazolium-based ionic liquids can dissolve cellulose, there have been many fundamental and applicable studies on various ionic liquid treatments for the chemical conversion of <b>lignocellulosics.</b> Miyafuji et al. [7] reported that 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([C 2 mim][Cl]) penetrated into wood and liquefied the components of the wood by depolymerizing them. It has also been revealed that the reaction atmosphere affects the reaction behavior of wood during [C 2 mim][Cl] treatment [8]. The detailed mechanisms of wood liquefaction in various ionic liquids have also been clarified [9 – 12].|$|R

2500|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that the huge supply of agricultural cellulose, the <b>lignocellulosic</b> material {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "Nature's polymer", would be an ideal source of material for biofuels and many other products. Composed of lignin and monomer sugars such as glucose, fructose, arabinose, galactose, and xylose, these constituents are very valuable in their own right. To this point in history, there are some methods commonly used to coax [...] "recalcitrant" [...] cellulose to separate or hydrolyse into its lignin and sugar parts, treatment with; steam explosion, supercritical water, enzymes, acids and alkalines. All these methods involve heat or chemicals, are expensive, have lower conversion rates and produce waste materials. In recent years the rise of [...] "mechanochemistry" [...] has resulted in the use of ball mills and other mill designs to reduce cellulose to a fine powder {{in the presence of a}} catalyst, a common bentonite or kaolinite clay, that will hydrolyse the cellulose quickly and with low energy input into pure sugar and lignin. Still currently only in pilot stage, this promising technology offers the possibility that any agricultural economy might be able to get rid of its requirement to refine oil for transportation fuels. This would be a major improvement in carbon neutral energy sources and allow the continued use of internal combustion engines on a large scale.|$|E
50|$|Ethanol is {{an alcohol}} {{produced}} from fermenting carbohydrates in plants. Bioethanol {{can be produced}} mainly from three different kinds of raw materials, namely simple sugars, starch, and <b>lignocellulosic</b> biomass. Since the prices of the raw materials are very volatile and can easily change, <b>lignocellulosic</b> biomass has been extensively studied due to its cheap price and abundance in agricultural countries like the Philippines. Some of the top sources of <b>lignocellulosic</b> biomass are forest residues, municipal solid wastes, and agricultural wastes like sugarcane baggase, nipa sap, rice straws, etc.|$|E

30|$|The current higher {{manufacturing}} cost of biofuels production from <b>lignocellulosics</b> hinders the commercial process development.
