Although {{there have been several}} improvements and developments in calibration of the digital frame sensor, only limited progresses has been made in the context of multispectral image calibration. To this end, a specific photogrammetric flight was executed to try to calibrate the geometric parameters of a large format aerial digital camera. This photogrammetric flight was performed in the “Principado de Asturias” and it has been designed with a Ground Sample Distance of 6 cm, formed by two strips perpendicular between each other, with five images each one and a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>overlap</b> of 60 %.

40|$|Purpose Knowledge about {{offenders}} and knowledge about victims {{has traditionally been}} undertaken without formal consideration of the overlap among the two. A small but growing research agenda has examined the extent of this overlap. At the same time, {{there has been a}} minimal amount of research regarding offending and victimization among minority youth, and this is most apparent with respect to Hispanics, who have been increasing in population in the United States. Materials & Methods This study explores the joint, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>overlap</b> between offending and victimization among a sample of Puerto Rican youth from the Bronx, New York. Results Results indicate: (1) an overlap between offending and victimization that persists over time, (2) a considerable overlap in the number, type, direction, and magnitude of the effect of individual, familial, peer, and contextual factors on both offending and victimization, (3) some of the factors related to offending were only relevant at baseline and not for the growth in offending but that several factors were associated with the growth in victimization, and (4) various risk factors could not explain much of the overlap between offending and victimization.

40|$|With the {{participation}} of about 65 % in the total growing stock of conifers, silver fir {{is the most important}} and the best represented conifer species in Croatia. The increasing share of sanitary felling in the annual felling plans demands that special attention be paid to the health status of fir forests and the quantity of unplanned felling. This is the reason why dieback of silver fir in beech-fir forests in the Dinaric Alps is an acute and topical management-ecological problem. In the past 10 years, the share of total unplanned felling in the overall annual felling for fir has amounted to 57 %. Such a high share of unplanned yield (mainly snags) has had a negative effect on sustainable forest management. Determining the spatial distribution of damaged trees and snags, as well as their monitoring is one of the priorities of sustainable management. Hence, it is of utmost importance to detect less healthy stands and apply timely measures for the purpose of maintaining their vitality and productivity at an optimal level. Due to the seriously disturbed stand stability caused by forced canopy opening, which in turn affects the health condition and natural regeneration of the stand, it is necessary not only to detect snags but also determine the causes of dieback. According to the results of past research, increased tree dieback is associated with the impact of different site and stand characteristics (altitude, exposition, slope, soil, structure, etc.), as well as abiotic and biotic factors (fir needle moth, mistletoe); however, the real causes are yet to be discovered. It is difficult to make efficient snag inventories with standard field methods. For large areas, a remote sensing method (the application of CIR aerial photographs) is much more practical, more cost effective and more reliable. All research activities so far have proved that, in terms of accuracy, this method is equal to field working methods, while in terms of speed and objectivity it is far more efficient. Snag inventories by means of CIR aerial photography interpretation and GIS enable efficient enumeration (detection) and spatial distribution (mapping) of snags. The proposed method is highly important not only for the detection and monitoring of the occurrence, distribution and direction of dieback progress, but also for the detection of possible dieback causes, on the basis of which experts will prescribe adequate measures and treatments. The objective of CIR aerial photography interpretation is to determine the current situation and acquire an objective picture of forest condition (database) in as short a period as possible, while mapping on a color infrared digital orthophoto (DOP) is intended to provide the spatial distribution of snags for the surveyed area. An aerial survey of the Lika area with the CIR film (Forest Administration Gospić) was conducted in strips (Fig. 3). The coordinates of the start and finish points of aerial photogrammetric series in the associated zones of the Gauss-Krüger cartographic projection, as well as planned strip lengths, are given in the following survey (Table 1). A total of 88 aerial photographs were taken at an average scale of 1 : 6000 and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>overlap</b> of 60 %, which allows for the interpretation of individual trees in the stereomodel. As the total length of all the three strips amounted to 40, 243 m (40. 24 km), an area of 5, 548 ha was surveyed. Since aerial photography provided an insight into the condition of the stands in the investigated area, and since the results obtained by photointerpretation of CIR aerial photographs indicated acute fir damage (the average damaged tree is 61. 70 %), snag inventory (mapping) was undertaken. In the localities of fir forests, dieback was observed in the form of smaller or bigger groups of trees. Hence, areas of 1 ha (sample plots) were delineated on a random sample in the color infrared DOP (1 : 5000). All visible snags were then mapped in each area (Fig. 1). The central parts of the images were used to construct a DOP. The pixel size of each orthophoto is 0. 5 m. According to the spatial snag distribution, the number of snags (density) per strip ranged between 23 and 105 per ha (Fig. 2). Since the values were not similar for all the plots, all the identified snags were mapped in the color infrared DOP. A total of 17, 445 snags were mapped in the study area (Fig. 4). GIS was used to produce a cartographic presentation of spatial snag distribution along the survey strips. In order to produce a digital orthophoto, it was necessary to construct a digital relief model. Data for the DRM were obtained by vectorizing the contour lines from the associated sheets of the Basic Map of Croatia (BMC) of 1 : 5000 scale and topographic maps (TM 25) at a scale of 1 : 25000. Since individual tree mortality is a stochastic, rare and irregular event (Eid and Tuhus 2001) and since this is a karst terrain, slope variability in the study area is very high; therefore, it is not advisable {{to take into account the}} average slope in an area. As the same was also confirmed by the research of Antonić and Legović (1999), Pernar (1997), and Božić et al. (2004), the layers were generated from the DRM. Raster-GIS modeling provided the layers of slope and exposition. In this way, the values of altitude (Fig. 5), slope (Fig. 6) and exposition (Fig. 7) obtained by means of the DRM were assigned to every snag, in dependence of the location (position in space). An orthophoto and a digital relief model (DRM) were also entered into GIS as one of the layers, which enabled rapid spatial analysis and an efficient access to data (Fig. 8). Next, the obtained results were statistically analyzed and the data of spatial snag distribution and geomorphological features were processed. The most important result ensuing from the presented method of rapid snag inventory is the thematic maps, which present spatial snag distribution for the investigated area. Not only is field work very expensive and long-lasting (Boyle et al., 1998), but it is also extremely difficult in barely accessible terrains or on steep slopes. A method based on remote sensing (aerial or satellite images) considerably contributes to the solution of the afore mentioned problems and provides a more practical, less expensive and more reliable manner of enumerating dry trees and stands over large areas. In combination with GIS technology, the production of a map of spatial snag distribution takes 5 – 10 minutes per hectare of the inventoried area. Such maps provide an insight into the field condition and spatial snag distribution in a very short time. They can also be used as a basis for the calculation of mean snag density and for conducting a variety of analyses intended to predict efficient measures of mitigating dieback effects. Based on the results of statistical analysis, it can be concluded that the spatial distribution of snags is influenced by geomorphological features (terrain orientation, slope and altitude). Variance analysis (F= 278. 79; p< 0. 001) showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the spatial distribution of snags with regard to terrain orientation (exposition) and slope. According to the results, the number of snags increases in accordance with an increase in the slope on the north-eastern and northern exposition (Fig. 9). The Tukey HSD test proved that, in terms of slope, all terrain orientations are clearly differentiated in relation to the occurrence of snags, except the S and SE. This was expected, since {{the participation}} of fir in these expositions is lower. As for terrain orientation, there is also a statistically significant difference in terms of altitude (F= 102. 6; p< 0. 001). The results show that the number of snags in the E and NE exposition rises with an increase in altitude (Fig. 10). The results of statistical analysis should not be used to make one-sided conclusions based on the correlation between fir snag distribution and mezorelief features. Undoubtedly, however, the spatial distribution (location) of each single snag is conditioned by edaphic and micro-relief site characteristics (soil depth, skeletalness), i. e. total soil capacity for water retention in the rhizosphere zone. Pernar (2001) directly associates the productivity of fir stands with soil depth, while Bigler et al. (2004) use the increment of mature fir trees as a predictor of fir dieback. Research by Certini et al. (2000) also confirms soil depth as a direct and indirect (distribution and virulence of pathogenic fungus Heterobasidion annosum (Fries.) Bref.)) factor of fir tree mortality. Taking into account the obtained results, a rapid and economic snag inventory is a must both for the needs of forest management and protection and for the needs of other scientific disciplines. At the Fourth Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, held on 2 October 2003, it was proposed that dry trees should be used as a new indicator of biodiversity, or in other words, that snags should have special ecological significance for biodiversity within forest ecosystems. It is, therefore, predicted that snag inventories will be undertaken with increasing frequency. In accordance with this, the proposed method could become an irreplaceable tool and a complement to standard field method. In addition, it has versatile applications, including national, regional or local forests taxation, certification processes, studies of site quality for animal species which depend on dry trees; classification of older stands, etc. The obtained results not only provided the current forest condition (inventory), but also indicated potential (focal points) and purpose of aerial surveys. Aerial photographs provide a survey of the field condition in a short time period, as well as allow for the possibility of planning efficient measures of mitigating dieback effects and evaluating dieback probability and rate. The results of the analyses enable the study of particular environmental features and their effects on forest dieback, as well as indicate the direction of future multidisciplinary research involving complex analyses of all environmental features. The results of the research are applicable primarily in the field of forest management, protection and harvesting, but they can also provide a basis for interpretations of events occurring in other fields...|$|E

Inventarizacija sušaca interpretacijom infracrvenih kolornih (ICK) aerosnimaka i GIS-a omogućuje učinkovito prebrojavanje (detekciju) i prostornu distribuciju (kartiranje) sušaca. Interpretacijom ICK aerosnimaka može se ustanoviti trenutačno stanje, tj. u kratkom razdoblju dobiti objektivan uvid u stanje šuma (baza podataka), a kartiranjem na digitalnom ortofotu (DOF-u) dobiti prostorna distribucija sušaca za snimljeno područje. Važnost predložene metode ogleda se u ustanovljavanju pojave i praćenju prostiranja te smjera napredovanja sušenja, kao i mogućih uzroka sušenja na temelju kojih će stručnjaci propisati odgovarajuće mjere i zahvate koje je potrebno provesti. Budući da se aerosnimanjem područja Like (UŠP Gospić) dobio pregled stanja sastojina na istraživanom području, a rezultati fotointerpretacije upućuju na izrazitu oštećenost jele (srednje oštećeno stablo iznosi 61, 79 %), pristupilo se inventarizaciji sušaca. Na istraživanom području ukupno je kartirano 17 445 sušaca. Svakomu sušcu, ovisno o lokaciji, pridodane su vrijednosti nagiba, nadmorske visine i izloženosti dobivene raster GIS modeliranjem iz digitalnoga modela reljefa. Najznačajniji su rezultat predstavljene metode brze inventarizacije sušaca tematske karte koje prikazuju prostornu distribuciju sušaca za istraživano područje. U kombinaciji s GIS tehnologijom izrada karte prostornoga rasporeda sušaca traje 5 – 10 minuta po hektaru inventarizirane površine. Na temelju rezultata provedene statističke analize može se zaključiti da geomorfološke značajke (orijentacija terena, nagib i nadmorska visina) utječu na prostornu distribuciju sušaca. Rezultati provedenih analiza omogućuju proučavanje utjecaja pojedinih značajki okoliša na sušenje šuma i ukazuju na pravce budućih multidisciplinarnih istraživanja radi kompleksnih analiza svih značajki okoliša.

Hence, this model was first validated using visual inspection and fundamental diagram (q-ρ [...] a [...]) and then by comparing pair-wise simulated and observed interactions between vehicles types. For estimating interactions, whenever a vehicle was found to be following or overtaking another vehicle, it was considered to be interacting with that vehicle. Therefore, a vehicle in measurement region can have 0, 1, 2 or 3 interactions based on the type of vehicles and the minimum gaps to the sides and front. If one vehicle is followed by another and at the same time overtaken by the third, it would have two interactions. Similarly, if there was only one vehicle in the frame the number of interactions would be zero. Vehicles travelling side by side (with overlap > 50 %) and having different speeds were also considered to be involved in overtaking even if the overtaking manoeuvre could not be completed in the video. These interactions were grouped by vehicle types and expressed as the ratio of the number of vehicles interacting to that observed for that vehicle type. Here, vehicles with gap more than 60  m were not assumed to be following. Similarly, the vehicles with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>overlaps</b> were considered as overtaking or overtaken.|$|R

40|$|Subject of {{this study}} is the {{development}} of a generic method to evaluate the characteristics of future vehicle fleets, which assist in vehicle compatibility research. The ever increasing demands for occupant safety have led to improved crashworthiness of vehicles. However, vehicles have become increasingly stiff over the last decades. In combination with a trend of heavier and higher vehicles this results in more aggressive and incompatible vehicles. Also the trend of smaller and lighter vehicles results in a mismatch of vehicles. Compatibility research focuses on improvement of crashworthiness while taking the safety of a possible crash partner into account with the aim to reduce the injury risks off all crash partners. In this regard it is important to conduct research of behaviour on a fleet wide basis. The generic vehicle modelling procedure developed in FIMCAR was used to generate a set of MADYMO models of various vehicles. Due to the limited available data, only three different car models could be made, the Supermini 2, Small Family Car 2 and SUV 4. The created models are tuned with the test data of Full Width Rigid Barrier (FWRB) and checked with test data of Offset Deformable Barrier (ODB) tests. To compensate the limited amount of vehicles additional simulations were ran with variable masses. The available models are used to run two large sets of simulations with various vehicle parameters, like <b>longitudinal</b> stiffness, <b>overlap</b> and speed. These simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the vehicle fleet. For crash severity evaluations the Vehicle Pulse Index (VPI) is used, in which higher VPI values represent a lower crash performance with higher risk of injury...|$|R
50|$|The D.XV was {{the last}} LFG design to use the Klinkerrumpfe (clinker built fuselage) structure, which {{produced}} a round cross section fuselage with thin, <b>overlapping,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> spruce strips supported by a light wooden frame, used on a succession of fighter types beginning with the D.IV. Its wings had constant chord and blunt tips, mounted with more stagger than on their earlier designs. The D.XV was a cantilevered single bay biplane with a lower wing of shorter span than the upper, so the interplane struts leaned outwards. There were no bracing wires. The second prototype differed in having a broader chord, slightly greater span upper wing and narrower chord lower planes. The larger upper wing had a trailing edge cut-out to enhance vision from the cockpit, a feature absent from the first aircraft. A single I interplane strut on each side, broadly faired to the wings at top and bottom, replaced the earlier pairs. Only the upper wings carried ailerons. Both had a flush mounted radiator {{similar to those used}} in the Albatros D.V fighters mounted within the upper wing ahead of the pilot.|$|R
40|$|Tailored {{plasmonic}} nanoantennas {{are needed}} for diverse applications, among those sensing. Surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy using adapted nanoantenna substrates is an efficient technique for the selective detection of molecules by their vibrational spectra, even in small quantity. Highly doped semiconductors have been proposed as innovative materials for plasmonics, especially for more flexibility concerning the targeted spectral range. Here, we report on rectangular-shaped, highly Si-doped InAsSb nanoantennas sustaining polarization switchable longitudinal and transverse plasmonic resonances in the mid-infrared. For small array periodicities, the highest reflectance intensity is obtained. Large periodicities {{can be used to}} combine localized surface plasmon resonances (SPR) with array resonances, as shown in electromagnetic calculations. The nanoantenna arrays can be efficiently used for broadband SEIRA spectroscopy, exploiting the spectral overlap between the large longitudinal or transverse plasmonic resonances and narrow infrared active absorption features of an analyte molecule. We demonstrate an increase of the vibrational line intensity up to a factor of 5. 7 of infrared-active absorption features of vanillin in the fingerprint spectral region, yielding enhancement factors of three to four orders of magnitude. Moreover, an optimized readout for SPR sensing is proposed based on slightly <b>overlapping</b> <b>longitudinal</b> and transverse localized SPR...|$|R

In this library of compounds the bulkier substituents distort {{the geometry of}} the chromophores and shift the lowest energy absorption band {{as a consequence of}} reduced π–π stacking and inter-chromophore <b>overlap.</b> <b>Longitudinal</b> displacement of the conjugated core is affected by donor–acceptor intermolecular interactions and twisting of the thiophene ring out of the plane of the DPP core, whereas lateral displacement was correlated to distortion of the NLactam–C(R) bond out of the plane of the DPP core. The di-substituted TDPP with hexyl units exhibit high molecular planarity, strong close packing of the conjugated core and significant red shift of the maximum of absorption in the solid, whereas the mono-substituted compounds with hexyl and ethyl acetate units are the least distorted of the series because of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that increases the molecular overlap and planarity of the chromophores. Therefore the family of mono-substituted TDPPs and more specifically the ones with ethyl acetate substituents show good potential for modulating the molecular geometry and optimizing the charge transport in materials for organic electronic applications...|$|R

Sixteen male subjects had a 23 -gauge hypodermic needle microprobe inserted 3 cm deep into the medial aspect of their anesthetized gastrocnemius muscles. Data were gathered on each subject for one of two randomly assigned treatments: a) ultrasound treatment on precooled tissue, or b) ultrasound with no preceding treatment. Each treatment consisted of ultrasound delivered topically at 1. 5 watts/cm 2 in a continuous mode for 10 minutes. Ultrasound was applied in an <b>overlapping</b> <b>longitudinal</b> motion at 4 cm/s, with temperature readings recorded at 30 -second intervals. We discovered a difference between the two treatment methods [t(14) = 16. 26, p <. 0001].

For girls in the United States and boys in both countries, TV violence viewing {{was significantly related to}} concurrent aggression and significantly predicted future changes in aggression. The strength of the relation depended as much on the frequency with which violence was viewed as on the extent of the violence. For boys the effect was exacerbated by {{the degree to which the}} boy identified with TV characters. Path analyses suggested a bidirectional causal effect in which violence viewing engenders aggression, and aggression engenders violence viewing. No evidence was found that those children predisposed to aggression or those with aggressive parents are affected more by TV violence. However, a number of other variables were found to be correlates of aggression and violence viewing. The most plausible model to explain these findings seems to be a multiprocess model in which violence viewing and aggression affect each other and, in turn, are stimulated by related variables. Observational learning undoubtedly plays a role, but its role may be no more important than the attitude changes that TV violence produces, the justification for aggressive behavior that TV violence provides, or the cues for aggressive problem solving that it furnishes. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: With {{comparable}} baseline {{performance on}} executive functions (EF) and memory between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), {{it is currently}} unclear if both diseases can be distinguished longitudinally on these measures reliably. Methods: A total of 111 participants (33 AD, 31 bvFTD, and 47 controls) were followed-up annually over a 4 -year period and tested on measures of EF, memory, and orientation. Linear mixed-effect models were constructed using disease severity as a nuisance variable to examine profiles of neuropsychological performance decline. Results: At baseline, overlap in terms of cognitive impairment between bvFTD and AD on multiple EF, memory, and orientation measures was present. Longitudinally, only disinhibition (Hayling total errors) appeared sensitive to discriminating AD from bvFTD; however, only after the first annual follow-up. Subgroup analyses on smaller samples revealed comparable profiles on EF tasks at baseline and over time between bvFTD and AD who presented with impaired EF at presentation, and on memory and orientation tasks between AD and bvFTD who presented with severe amnesia. Conclusions: Our results replicate previous findings showing only moderate discriminability between AD and bvFTD at clinical presentation on EF and memory measures. More importantly, we also show that <b>longitudinal</b> trajectories strongly <b>overlap</b> for both dementias on these measures.

40|$|Traditional manned {{airborne}} surveys are usually expensive and {{the resolution of}} the acquired images is often limited. The main advantage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system acting as a photogrammetric sensor platform over more traditional manned airborne system is the high flexibility that allows image acquisition from unconventional viewpoints, the low cost in comparison with classical aerial photogrammetry and the high resolution images obtained. Nowadays there is a necessity for surveying small areas and in these cases, it is not economical the use of normal large format aerial or metric cameras to acquire aerial photos, therefore, the use of UAV platforms can be very suitable. Also the large availability of digital cameras has strongly enhanced the capabilities of UAVs. The use of digital non metric cameras together with the UAV could be used for multiple applications such as aerial surveys, GIS, wildfire mapping, stability of landslides, crop monitoring, etc. The aim of this work was to develop a low cost and accurate methodology in the production of orthophotos and Digital Elevation Models (DEM). The study was conducted in the province of Almeria, south of Spain. The photogrammetric flight had an altitude of 50 m over ground, covering an area of 5. 000 m 2 approximately. The UAV used in this work was the md 4 - 200, which is an electronic battery powered quadrocopter UAV developed by Microdrones GmbH, Germany. It had on-board a Pextax Optio A 40 digital non metric camera with 12 Megapixels. It features a 3 x optical zoom lens with a focal range covering angles of view equivalent to those of 37 – 111 mm lens in 35 mm format. The quadrocopter can be programmed to follow a route defined by several waypoints and actions and it has the ability for vertical take off and landing. Proper flight geometry during image acquisition is essential in order to minimize the number of photographs, avoid areas without a good coverage and make the overlaps homogeneous.
