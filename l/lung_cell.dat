40|$|The {{effects of}} {{glucocorticoids}} and agents affecting membrane phospholipid metabolism on $ beta$-adrenergic receptors ($ beta$AR) {{have been studied}} in A 549 cultured human <b>lung</b> tumor <b>cells</b> and in IM- 9 cultured human lymphocytes. Various glucocorticoids increased the density of $ beta$AR in A 549 <b>lung</b> <b>cells</b> but not in IM- 9 lymphocytes, although they did increase insulin receptor density in IM- 9 lymphocytes. In contrast, bee venom phospholipase A$ sb 2 $ (0. 05 - 0. 2 units/ml), but not phospholipases C or D., downregulated $ beta$AR in IM- 9 lymphocytes, but did not affect $ beta$AR in A 549 <b>lung</b> <b>cells.</b> Upregulation of $ beta$AR by glucocorticoids was partially reversed by arachidonic acid (10 $ mu$M) but not by lysophospatidylcholine. These results suggest that glucocorticoids upregulate pulmonary $ beta$AR partly through their inhibition of membrane phospholipase A 2 and the subsequent generation of arachidonic acid and/or its metabolites, which may act by modulating a direct effect of glucocorticoids on the synthesis of $ beta$AR. Coculturing IM- 9 lymphocytes and A 549 <b>lung</b> <b>cells</b> results in a 2 - 3 -fold increase in the density of $ beta$AR in A 549 <b>lung</b> <b>cells.</b> Lymphocyte conditioned medium (LCM) has the same effect, which is moderately sensitive to heat, is retained by ultrafiltration over a 10, 000 m. w. cut-off filter, and is reduced by trypsin treatment or by preincubation of lymphocytes with cycloheximide (1 $ mu$m). Treatment of <b>lung</b> <b>cells</b> with cycloheximide also prevents the effect of LCM. Glucocorticoids, which also increase $ beta$AR density in A 549 <b>lung</b> <b>cells,</b> markedly potentiate the effects of LCM.

40|$|Abstract Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa is {{the major}} {{pathogen}} associated with chronic and ultimately fatal lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). To investigate how P. aeruginosa -derived vesicles may contribute to lung disease, we explored their ability to associate with human <b>lung</b> <b>cells.</b> Results Purified vesicles associated with <b>lung</b> <b>cells</b> and were internalized in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Vesicles from a CF isolate exhibited a 3 - to 4 -fold greater association with <b>lung</b> <b>cells</b> than vesicles from the lab strain PAO 1. Vesicle internalization was temperature-dependent and was inhibited by hypertonic sucrose and cyclodextrins. Surface-bound vesicles rarely colocalized with clathrin. Internalized vesicles colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker, TRAPα, {{as well as with}} ER-localized pools of cholera toxin and transferrin. CF isolates of P. aeruginosa abundantly secrete PaAP (PA 2939), an aminopeptidase that associates with the surface of vesicles. Vesicles from a PaAP knockout strain exhibited a 40 % decrease in cell association. Likewise, vesicles from PAO 1 overexpressing PaAP displayed a significant increase in cell association. Conclusion These data reveal that PaAP promotes the association of vesicles with <b>lung</b> <b>cells.</b> Taken together, these results suggest that P. aeruginosa vesicles can interact with and be internalized by <b>lung</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> and contribute to the inflammatory response during infection. </p...|$|R

The mechanism for organ-specific metastasis is poorly understood, although evidence has suggested that the chemokine stromal derived factor- 1 (CXCL 12) and its cognate receptor CXCR 4 may regulate breast cancer metastasis. We hypothesized that the CXCL 12 -CXCR 4 biological axis is important in mediating non-small <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> cancer metastases. Our results indicate that both non-small <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> cancer tumor specimens resected from patients and non-small <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> cancer <b>cell</b> lines express CXCR 4, but not CXCL 12. Non-small <b>cell</b> <b>lung</b> cancer <b>cell</b> lines undergo chemotaxis in response to CXCL 12.

Here we first present evidence showing that cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) {{has the ability to}} activate the HPV- 16 p 97 promoter by acting on the long control region (LCR) in <b>lung</b> epithelial <b>cells.</b> Interestingly, we observed that CSC-induced p 97 promoter activation occurs in a dose-dependent manner in both tumor A- 549 (lung adenocarcinoma), H- 2170 (bronchial carcinoma), SiHa or Hela (cervical carcinoma) cells but not in non-tumor BEAS- 2 B (bronchial) or NL- 20 (alveolar) <b>lung</b> <b>cells</b> unless they ectopically expressed the HPV- 16 E 6 and E 7 oncogenes.

DNA adducts of B[a]P-metabolites were determined in target cells using 32 P-postlabeling; oxidative DNA damage (7 -hydro- 8 -oxo- 2 '-deoxyguanosine [8 -oxodG]) was evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Increased DNA adducts were observed in <b>lung</b> <b>cells</b> coincubated with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Activation of PMN with PMA, or addition of more activated PMN in relation to the number of <b>lung</b> <b>cells,</b> further increased the number of adducts, the latter in a dose-response manner. Incubation with B[a]P- 4, 5 -diol did not result in any adduct formation, while B[a]P- 7, 8 -diol led to a significant number of adducts.
