These results demonstrate the extensive variability observed in this group of viruses. TheAC 4 ORF is the least conserved among these viruses. In order to further asses the variability in the CLCuDcausing begomoviruses, the region showing minimum similarity in the DNA-A sequence was first determined by a comparison of segments of different lengths of the aligned sequences.

The {{question as to whether}} ChLCB contributes to the development of disease symptoms such as <b>leaf</b> <b>curling</b> and enations remain to be answered. We have previously shown that the expression of βC 1 of CLCuMB develops all symptoms of cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease in Nicotiana benthamiana when expressed from PVX vector. Findings The role of ChLCB in the induction of typical disease symptoms was studied by its expression from PVX vector in N. benthamiana. The expression of βC 1 from PVX vector developed severe <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> symptoms and leaf-like enations that resemble the phenotype induced by βC 1 of CLCuMB.

Results We demonstrate that RaLCD {{is caused by a}} complex of two Old World begomoviruses and their associated betasatellites. Radish <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> virus-Varanasi is identified as a new recombinant species, Radish <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> virus (RaLCV) sharing maximum nucleotide identity of 87. 7 % with Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Bangladesh virus-[Bangladesh: 2] (Accession number AF 188481) while the virus causing radish <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease-Pataudi is an isolate of Croton yellow vein mosaic virus-[India] (CYVMV-IN) (Accession number AJ 507777) sharing 95. 8 % nucleotide identity. Further, RDP analysis revealed that the RaLCV has a hybrid genome, a putative recombinant between Euphorbia <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> virus and Papaya <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> virus. Cloned DNA of either RaLCV or CYVMV induced mild <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> symptoms in radish plants. However, when these clones (RaLCV or CYVMV) were individually co-inoculated with their associated cloned DNA betasatellite, symptom severity and viral DNA levels were increased in radish plants and induced typical RaLCD symptoms. To further extend these studies, we carried out an investigation of the interaction of these radish-infecting begomoviruses and their associated satellite, with two tomato infecting begomoviruses (Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Gujarat virus and Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> New Delhi virus). Both of the tomato-infecting begomoviruses showed a contrasting and differential interaction with DNA satellites, not only in the capacity to interact with these molecules but also in the modulation of symptom phenotypes by the satellites. Conclusion This is the first report and experimental demonstration of Koch's postulate for begomoviruses associated with radish <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease. Further observations also provide direct evidence of lateral movement of weed infecting begomovirus in the cultivated crops and the present study also suggests that the exchange of betasatellites with other begomoviruses would create a new disease complex posing a serious threat to crop production. </p...|$|R

40|$|Begomoviruses are plant-infecting viruses, {{which are}} {{transmitted}} by the whitefly vector Bemisia tabaci. They have a genome of single-stranded DNA {{that consists of}} either a single (monopartite) or two components (bipartite) with a component size of approximately 2. 8 kb. Many monopartite begomoviruses in the Old World {{have been found to}} be associated with betasatellite and alphasatellite molecules, which are about half the size of their helper begomovirus genome. Betasatellites have been shown to be necessary for inducing severe disease symptoms. In Cameroon, B. tabaci has been associated with suspected begomovirus infections in many crop and weed species. Despite their growing importance, only begomoviruses infecting cassava have been studied in Cameroon in any detail. Thus, there was a need for additional information on diversity and distribution of begomoviruses and satellites in vegetable crops and dictyledonous weeds, which likely serve as virus reservoirs. In field studies carried out in this study, a high incidence of okra <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease was found in Cameroon. Sequencing of viral genomes showed that the okra plants were infected by viruses of two previously known begomovirus species (Cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Gezira virus and Okra yellow crinkle virus) as well as a new recombinant begomovirus species (Okra <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Cameroon virus). In addition, a betasatellite (Cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Gezira betasatellite) and two alphasatellites (Okra <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Mali alphasatellite and Okra yellow crinkle Cameroon alphasatellite) were identified. Tomato plants with <b>leaf</b> <b>curling</b> were shown to contain isolates of a new begomovirus, Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Cameroon virus, and an alphasatellite, Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Cameroon alphasatellite (ToLCCMA). To study the potential begomovirus complexes infecting weeds, begomoviruses and satellites in plants of the weed Ageratum conyzoides with <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> symptoms were characterized. Sequence analyses showed that they were infected by isolates of a new begomovirus (Ageratum <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Cameroon virus), two new betasatellites (Ageratum <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Cameroon betasatellite and Ageratum <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Buea betasatellite), an alphasatellite (ToLCCMA) and two types of defective recombinants between a begomovirus and ToLCCMA. Putative recombinations were detected in begomovirus genomes for all three plant species studied, indicating that recombination is an important mechanism for their evolution. A close relationship between the begomoviruses infecting tomato and A. conyzoides, and the detection of the same alphasatellite in them support the idea that weeds are important reservoirs for begomoviruses and their satellites. This study has revealed a huge complexity of begomoviruses and DNA satellites previously largely unknown in West Africa and Central Africa.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundCotton {{is a major}} {{cash crop}} of Pakistan and its {{production}} is mainly hindered by cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease (CLCuD). This disease is caused by monopartite begomovirus associated with two satellites named as betasatellite and alphasatellite. Betasatellites are true satellites entirely dependent on helper begomoviruses and are symptom determinants which are essentially required for the typical symptoms of the disease. Alphasatellites are self-replicating circular ssDNA molecules which are associated with CLCuD complex. The role of alphasatellite is not fully understood. ResultCotton samples showing typical CLCuD symptoms were collected from areas across central Punjab, Pakistan during year 2011 – 12. All samples contained alphasatellites. Mixed-infection of alphasatellites associated with CLCuD complex was documented. Few samples showed the presence {{of more than one}} species of alphasatellite. A total of 45 alphasatellites were cloned and sequenced. The size of these alphasatellite ranges from 1362 to 1378 bp. All alphasatellites showed three conserved features i. e. 1) A stem-loop structure with a nonanucleotide (TAGTATTAC) sequence (2) An ORF encoding a Rep protein of about 36. 6 kDa, having up to 315 amino acids (3) An A-rich region of ~ 200 nt. Based on BLAST results we have found six distinct species of alphasatellites namely; Gossypium darwinii symptomless alphasatellite (GDarSLA), Guar <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> alphasatellite (GrLCuA), Okra <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> alphasatellite (OLCuA), Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Pakistan alphasatellite (ToLCPKA), Cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Multan alphasatellite (CLCuMA), and Cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Burewala alphasatellite (CLCuBuA). This was also confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. By considering the species cut-off limit for alphasatellites (83 %) the isolates fall into 5 species. But the percentage identity between some CLCuBuA and CLCuMA was 83. 3, so they are proposed to be considered as two different species. ConclusionOur data shows that at least six species of alphasatellites are found associated with cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease in Pakistan. Field samples are often associated with multiple species and one sample was found associated with three distinct alphasatellites in a single plant under field conditions. Infection of multiple alphasatellite and their probable role in CLCuD are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} diversity of Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> viruses (ToLCVs), {{from the two}} main tomato growing areas of Jessore and Joydebpur, Bangladesh, was investigated. The viral DNA was amplified from tomato plants exhibiting mild and severe symptoms by polymerase chain reaction, and the complete genomes of the ToLCVs were sequenced. An isolate of the bipartite Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> New Delhi virus-Severe (ToLCNDV-Svr) {{was associated with the}} severe symptom phenotype from Jessore (ToLCNDV-Svr[Jes]). A previously undescribed monopartite virus, designated Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Joydebpur virus-Mild (ToLCJV-Mld), was sequenced from plants showing mild symptoms. ToLCNDV-Svr[Jes] was most closely related to ToLCNDV-[Lucknow] at 95. 7 % nucleotide (nt) identity and Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Gujarat virus-[Varanasi] at 90. 6 % nt identity, based on DNA-A and -B component sequences. ToLCJV-Mld was similar to Pepper <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Bangladesh virus at 87. 1 % DNA-A nt identity. Identification of ToLCNDV-Svr[Jes] and ToLCJV-Mld was in addition to the previously described Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Bangladesh virus, with which they shared 73. 2 and 86. 0 % DNA-A nt identities, thus demonstrating the existence of at least three distinct viruses infecting tomato in Bangladesh. Nucleotide identities and placement in phylogenetic trees suggested that the three ToLCVs may have had different evolutionary pathways. The whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, transmitted the viruses of this study equally efficiently. Four tomato cultivars (TLB 111, TLB 130, TLB 133, and TLB 182) resistant/ tolerant to South Indian ToLCV were screened against the Bangladesh ToLCVs in 2003 - 04. Although challenged by diverse viruses and potentially mixed infections, disease incidence remained low (6 to 45 %) in the resistant cultivars compared with local cultivars (68 to 100 %) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Identification of {{the causal}} agent of yellow <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease on cucumbers.   Yellow <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease has been {{reported}} to cause serious diseases and yield losses on tobacco, chilli pepper, and tomato plants in Java. Similar symptoms were observed recently on cucumber plants from several growing areas in West Java (Bogor), Central Java (Tegal and Sukoharjo), and Yogyakarta (Sleman). Symptom variations  including mosaic, chlorotic spotting, <b>leaf</b> <b>curling,</b> blistering, vein banding, reduction and distortion of leaf and fruit were observed. Serological detection using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) showed infection of several viruses. Antibodies specific to Squash mosaic comovirus (SqMV), Zucchini yellow mosaic potyvirus (ZyMV), dan Cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV) were reacted positively with field samples. No serological reactions were observed with antibodies to Tobacco ringspot potyvirus (TRSV) and Watermelon mosaic potyvirus (WMV). Molecular detection approach based on Polymerase Chain Reaction was undergone using universal primers for Geminivirus, pAL 1 v 1978 and pAR 1 c 715. DNA fragment 1600 bp in size, was successfully amplified from leaf samples originated from Tegal, Sleman, Bogor, and Sukoharjo. Further identification by nucleotide sequencing indicated that virus isolates causing yellow <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease on cucumber have highest homology (95. 7 % to 98. 6 %) with Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> New Delhi virus-[Cucumber:Indonesia] (AB 613825) from Klaten, Central Java, Indonesia...|$|R
40|$|Cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease (CLCuD) is {{the major}} biotic {{constraint}} to cotton production on the Indian subcontinent, and is caused by monopartite begomoviruses accompanied by a specific DNA satellite, Cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Multan betasatellite (CLCuMB). Since the breakdown of resistance against CLCuD in 2001 / 2002, only one virus, the "Burewala" strain of Cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Kokhran virus (CLCuKoV-Bur), and a recombinant form of CLCuMB have consistently been identified in cotton across the major cotton growing areas of Pakistan. Unusually a bipartite isolate of the begomovirus Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> virus was identified in CLCuD-affected cotton recently. In the study described here we isolated the bipartite begomovirus Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) from CLCuD-affected cotton. To assess the frequency and geographic occurrence of ToLCNDV in cotton, CLCuD-symptomatic cotton plants were collected from across the Punjab and Sindh provinces between 2013 and 2015. Analysis of the plants by diagnostic PCR showed the presence of CLCuKoV-Bur in all 31 plants examined and ToLCNDV in 20 of the samples. Additionally, a quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the levels of the two viruses in co-infected plants suggests that coinfection of ToLCNDV with the CLCuKoV-Bur/CLCuMB complex leads {{to an increase in}} the levels of CLCuMB, which encodes the major pathogenicity (symptom) determinant of the complex. The significance of these results are discussed...|$|R
