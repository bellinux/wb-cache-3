40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the case of}} indigenous privatization of the important fodder tree samata (Euphorbia stenoclada) and concurrent <b>legal</b> <b>curtailment</b> <b>of</b> this privatization among the Tanalana people of southwest Madagascar from a long-term perspective. Applying a framework for institutional change to empirical data derived from interviews conducted in 20 villages in the Mahafaly Plateau region, the study explores the process and mechanisms involved in creating and asserting private property rights to this common pool resource on the one hand, and the process <b>of</b> <b>curtailment</b> on the other. Implementation of the curtailing institutions is hampered by (1) the low bargaining power of village communities versus privatizers, which stems from the users’ preference for avoiding open conflicts and laissez faire ideology, (2) the low social acceptance and internalization <b>of</b> new <b>curtailment</b> rules, which are perceived as contradictory to customary resource privatization rights and the ideology of personal freedom restricted only by ancestral rules-in-use, and (3) ineffective self-governance and enforcement mechanisms based on pro-active monitoring of local users. Stressing the interplay between ideology and bargaining power in the context-specific constellation of actors, this paper contributes {{to the understanding of}} the transformation of property rights and institutional change in self-organized, traditional societies...|$|R

40|$|The green {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser medirostris) {{is a highly}} migratory, oceanic, anadromous species with a complex life history that makes it vulnerable to species-wide threats in both freshwater and at sea. Green sturgeon population declines have preceded <b>legal</b> protection and <b>curtailment</b> <b>of</b> activities in marine environments deemed to increase its extinction risk. Yet, its marine habitat is poorly understood. We built a statistical model to characterize {{green sturgeon}} marine habitat using data from a coastal tracking array located along the Siletz Reef near Newport, Oregon, USA that recorded the passage of 37 acoustically tagged green sturgeon. We classified seafloor physical habitat features with high-resolution bathymetric and backscatter data. We then described the distribution of habitat components {{and their relationship to}} green sturgeon presence using ordination and subsequently used generalized linear model selection to identify important habitat components. Finally, we summarized depth and temperature recordings from seven green sturgeon present off the Oregon coast that were fitted with pop-off archival geolocation tags. Our analyses indicated that green sturgeon, on average, spent a longer duration in areas with high seafloor complexity, especially where a greater proportion of the substrate consists of boulders. Green sturgeon in marine habitats are primarily found at depths of 20 - 60 meters and from 9. 5 - 16. 0 °C. Many sturgeon in this study were likely migrating in a northward direction, moving deeper, and may have been using complex seafloor habitat because it coincides with the distribution of benthic prey taxa or provides refuge from predators. Identifying important green sturgeon marine habitat is an essential step towards accurately defining the conditions that are necessary for its survival and will eventually yield range-wide, spatially explicit predictions of green sturgeon distribution...|$|R

40|$|The {{anticipated}} uptake {{of electric}} vehicles (EVs) {{has the potential}} to overload low-voltage power networks where several EVs might be simultaneously recharging on the same electrical substation feeder. The Esprit system is designed to avoid potential power outages and damage to network infrastructure by means <b>of</b> temporary <b>curtailment</b> <b>of</b> EV recharging to reduce the aggregate load on a single feeder. It is important that this intervention does not adversely affect service quality for EV users and other electricity consumers. In a field trial of localized clusters of EVs, the My Electric Avenue project assessed the acceptability <b>of</b> temporary <b>curtailment</b> <b>of</b> charging to EV drivers as well as testing the technical viability of Esprit. Analysis of data gathered through questionnaires, interviews and focus groups with participants in the trial indicates that temporary <b>curtailment</b> <b>of</b> charging by the Esprit technology did not cause significant inconvenience to EV users...|$|R

40|$|Congestion in the {{transmission}} network prevents {{execution of the}} desired market transactions. This results {{in some of the}} market transactions having to be curtailed, which translates into a loss to customers. This paper suggests that the decision to expand transmission facilities will depend on the loss sustained by the customer due to <b>curtailment</b> <b>of</b> market transactions vs. cost of installing new transmission facilities over a planning period. Thus, in a power system, the sum total cost of investment to expand transmission facilities and cost of cumulative loss due to <b>curtailment</b> <b>of</b> transactions to all the customers is set up as a minimization problem, which results in optimal transmission expansion needed over a planning period. With this consideration, the Benders decomposition technique is used for transmission expansion planning by taking investment cost as the master problem and loss due to <b>curtailment</b> <b>of</b> market transactions as the slave problem. The Southern Brazil power system is used as a test case where this methodology has been employed...|$|R
