According to a survey conducted by Amnesty International, political repression, systematic torture, ill treatment or disappearance was still practised in 110 countries. Human rights violations are most frequent during periods of political unrest. Along with repressing individuals and groups, governments may try to exercise control over ideas and information.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{released}} a statement on social media branding the comments about her unborn child as racist, noting that it saddened her that we <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>society</b> where these comments can be made. Năstase then apologised on social media regarding the comments he made about Williams, but made comments about Konta speaking to the umpire which upset him. In a further interview with the BBC, Năstase justified his comments to Konta stating that he only abused her after being ejected from the court and did so as a fan rather than a captain. Năstase additionally added that he regretted his behaviour in the incident. Nastase was not invited to the French Open and Wimbledon following his suspension. The Madrid Open however invited Nastase {{to be part of}} the prize giving ceremony, which ironically was won by Halep (another Romanian player). This was a move that was deemed irresponsible by the WTA who had revoked Nastase's privileges while the ITF carried out its investigation.|$|E
25|$|The {{promulgation}} of law for {{the protection}} of a position held purely on religious grounds cannot therefore be justified. It is irrational, as preferring the subjective over the objective. But it is also divisive, capricious and arbitrary. We do not <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>society</b> where all the people share uniform religious beliefs. The precepts of any one religion – any belief system – cannot, by force of their religious origins, sound any louder in the general law than the precepts of any other. If they did, those out in the cold would be less than citizens; and our constitution would be {{on the way to a}} theocracy, which is of necessity autocratic. The law of a theocracy is dictated without option to the people, not made by their judges and governments. The individual conscience is free to accept such dictated law; but the State, if its people are to be free, has the burdensome duty of thinking for itself.|$|E

25|$|Professor Katarina Sjöberg {{argues in}} The Wall Street Culture {{that within the}} media {{negative}} images of Wall Street are painted {{in terms of the}} district's market falls, money losses and deceitful gains. However, this is not what Wall Street investors are bothered by. Instead, it is the public's words and opinions which they feel mold their image. Sjöberg notes that in the American culture, money making is of utmost importance and knowing how to make money is considered to be respectable. Therefore, Wall Street investors prioritize their work as well as strive to climb the corporate ladder. They also feel obligated to maintain the image the public creates, because it strengthens their position as a Wall Street employee. They value seeing themselves as experts in their field, especially since they <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>society</b> that values wealth. This justifies their acts of greed, and allows them to take part in activities often deemed as criminal because they feel as though it is expected. Moreover, they do not regret their actions because to them, it is part of being an American. Aside from living up to the public's image, Wall Street workers justify their high salaries with an argument pointed out by Karen Ho in Disciplining Investment Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis, the Downsizing of Corporate America. She argues that {{due to the fact that}} the financial market is volatile in conjunction with the existence of job insecurity, Wall Street workers are compensated through their salaries.|$|E

In an interview, Gatlif stated that he wanted the movie to mirror the current times, adding that the times have not changed much, and that while the political extermination has gone, the psychological and political views of Romani have not. He criticised the French law that allows wanderers to stay in one place only for 24 hours. He was also critical of the plight of Romani in Hungary, Romania and Italy. He went on that the state of the Romani now in many places, [...] "with the rows of homeless people waiting for a bowl of soup with a tin can on their hands", is not very different from that in the concentration camps. Gatlif also lashed out against the fact that until 1969, Romani were required to have their papers stamped at a police station or city hall whenever they arrived at or left a French village. Bob Hill at Moving Pictures Network remarked that the movie draws parallels to the fact that [...] "we are once again veering toward a culture in which regimes and wealth determine who has the right to live free — and who has no rights at all", and cited present happenings such as the developments in the Middle East, racial wars and inter-country disputes. It added that the movie makes the audience ask themselves if they <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>society</b> that embraces or condemns diversity.|$|E

This does not have to do with morality. It has to do with legality. As human beings, we have to protect them as they are. It has to do with civil liberty," [...] said Congresswoman Julieta López, who pushed the bill, from the centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), whose 19 members voted for the law. Luis Alberto Mendoza, deputy of the center-right National Action Party (PAN), which opposed the law, said it was an [...] "attack against the family, which is society's natural group and is formed by a man and a woman." [...] Other than that, the PCS drew little opposition. Bishop Raúl Vera, who headed the Catholic Diocese of Saltillo, declined to condemn the law.

Twenty days after the law had passed, the country's first same-sex civil union took place in Saltillo. It was between 29-year-olds Karina Almaguer and Karla Lopez, a lesbian couple from Tamaulipas.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess whether there are any effects on household income changes and poverty reduction in Indonesia from living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> community that has a more democratic system of decision making, or from being a member of <b>a</b> <b>society</b> with <b>a</b> higher degree of cooperation. We constructed a democracy index and a cooperation index and find that a household would have had two percentage points higher income growth from 1993 to 2000 if it had <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>society</b> with <b>a</b> high degree of cooperation compared to living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>society</b> with the lowest degree of cooperation, if our results imply causality. This is substantial, since the average household per capita real income growth in the period 1993 to 2000 was 11 per cent. Moreover, our results suggest that cooperation may be of particular value for the poorest. We find that a poor household would have had six percentage points higher income growth from 1993 to 2000 if it had <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>society</b> with <b>a</b> high degree of cooperation compared to living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>society</b> with the lowest degree of cooperation, even if the total income growth for this group was only around seven per cent during the period.

60|$|I suppose one {{may take}} the popular misuse of the words Morality and Morals as some excuse for certain absurdities which are {{occasional}} fashions in speech and writing--certain old lay-figures, as ugly as the queerest Asiatic idol, which at different periods get propped into loftiness, and attired in magnificent Venetian drapery, so that whether they have a human face or not is of little consequence. One is, {{the notion that there}} is a radical, irreconcilable opposition between intellect and morality. I do not mean the simple statement of fact, which everybody knows, that remarkably able men have had very faulty morals, and have outraged public feeling even at its ordinary standard; but the supposition that the ablest intellect, the highest genius, will see through morality as a sort of twaddle for bibs and tuckers, a doctrine of dulness, a mere incident in human stupidity. We begin to understand the acceptance of this foolishness by considering that we <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>society</b> where we may hear a treacherous monarch, or a malignant and lying politician, or a man who uses either official or literary power as an instrument of his private partiality or hatred, or a manufacturer who devises the falsification of wares, or a trader who deals in virtueless seed-grains, praised or compassionated because of his excellent morals.|$|E
60|$|There is an {{attitude}} for which {{my friends and}} I were {{for a long period}} rebuked and even reviled; and of which at the present period we are less likely than ever to repent. It was always called Anti-Semitism; but it was always much more true to call it Zionism. At any rate it was much nearer {{to the nature of the}} thing to call it Zionism, whether or no it can find its geographical concentration in Zion. The substance of this heresy was exceedingly simple. It consisted entirely in saying that Jews are Jews; and as a logical consequence that they are not Russians or Roumanians or Italians or Frenchmen or Englishmen. During the war the newspapers commonly referred to them as Russians; but the ritual wore so singularly thin that I remember one newspaper paragraph saying that the Russians in the East End complained of the food regulations, because their religion forbade them to eat pork. My own brief contact with the Greek priests of the Orthodox Church in Jerusalem did not permit me to discover any trace of this detail of their discipline; and even the Russian pilgrims were said to be equally negligent in the matter. The point for the moment, however, is that if I was violently opposed to anything, it was not to Jews, but to that sort of remark about Jews; or rather to the silly and craven fear of making it a remark about Jews. But my friends and I had in some general sense a policy in the matter; and it was in substance the desire to give Jews the dignity and status of a separate nation. We desired that in some fashion, and so far as possible, Jews should be represented by Jews, should <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>society</b> of Jews, should be judged by Jews and ruled by Jews. I am an Anti-Semite if that is Anti-Semitism. It would seem more rational to call it Semitism.|$|E
