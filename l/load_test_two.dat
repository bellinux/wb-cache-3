40|$|Evaluating the {{condition}} of existing reinforced concrete structures is generally undertaken if the integrity of a structure is in question or if there is concern regarding the structure meeting the safety requirements.

40|$|The {{air blast}} tunnel (ABT) at MoD Shoeburyness {{is a unique}} testing {{facility}} capable of simulating pressure regimes recorded in long-duration blast events. Long-duration blasts are typically defined by a positive phase duration greater than 100 ms, observed in the far field of large explosions. Due to its highly brittle nature, glass panels require high-speed data capture to provide reliable engineering information about their response to blast loading. The harsh environment of the ABT makes accurate collection of this data very difficult. Current methods of data capture depend on interpretation of high-speed video footage, the accuracy of which is severely affected by shock wave induced camera shake. In a series of five companion static <b>loading</b> <b>tests,</b> <b>two</b> different methods of recording glass failure time were trialled; a circuit of conductive paint {{on the surface of}} the glass and a series of piezo transducers to record the acoustic profile at breakage. High-speed photography provided an independent correlation. Experimental results demonstrate that piezo transducers are a low-cost and comparatively accurate method of determining the time of glass failure and crack location in a static testing environment. In February 2017, a series of eight full-scale trials in the ABT demonstrated that piezo transducers were capable of replicating these results in a long-duration blast environment...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{hydraulic}} hammers are usually equipped with on-board energy measurement devices. Energy measurements {{in the field}} can therefore be taken continuously during entire pile driving processes. This paper outlines a method that directly uses energy measurements from the field for quantitative pile driving process monitoring. The kinetic energy delivered over one meter of pile penetration (KEMP) and the effective transferred energy delivered over one meter of pile penetration (EEMP) against soil resistance are calculated based on field measurements and are used as two indicators for pile driving process monitoring. The relationship between the EEMP and the pile capacity is confirmed by dynamic <b>tests</b> and static <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> on several well-monitored long steel H-piles. The EEMP values compare well with pile capacity predictions from a pile driving analyzer and from static analyses based on standard penetration tests, and with those measured from static <b>load</b> <b>tests.</b> The <b>two</b> energy indicators {{can also be used}} to effectively monitor the integrity of piles during construction.

The implementation of the new distribution factors will result in a less conservative rating of the longitudinal beams in this type of bridge.

To overcome these issues, the authors used a special type of core-aligned block (termed as double H-block) to construct shear wall, and the seismic performance of doubleH-block reinforced masonry shear walls was investigated by lateral cyclic <b>loading</b> <b>test.</b> <b>Two</b> large-sized double H-block reinforced masonry shear walls were designed and fabricated.

The bearing capacity of H-block shear walls decreased with the reduction of axial compression ratio, while the ductility increased. A model was also proposed to predict the shear strength of the grouted double H-block based on mechanical analysis of the internally grouted concrete. The accuracy of the model was verified through 30 H-block specimens under shear tests and it was found the grout ratio had a significant effect on the shear strength of the grouted double H-block. The model proposed by the Chinese masonry code was over conservative when the grout ratio was high. Finally, a modified shear capacity model was proposed and was found to be effective to predict the shear capacity of double H-block reinforced masonry shear wall...|$|R

The patient is asked to flex the elbow while resisting the elbow flexion by the examiner. The test is considered positive if the patient complains of pain during the resisted elbow flexion.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: PKU is a {{metabolic}} disorder {{caused by a}} mutation in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Icelandic neonatal screening for PKU started in 1972. The mutation causes a variable [corrected] dysfunction in PAH, that metabolizes phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine (Tyr) with the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4). Accumulation of Phe causes mental retardation and seizures. Current therapy focuses on Phe-restrictive diet and newer methods like BH 4 in large doses. The primary aim was to collect data about PKU in Iceland and evaluate therapy and screening. Additional focus was on BH 4 therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information was gathered from Landspitali medical charts retrospectively. Serum-Phe (S-Phe) measurements, age at initiation of therapy, PAH mutation types and information on current therapy was collected. Results from BH 4 <b>loading</b> <b>tests</b> were collected. Results: 27 patients {{have been diagnosed with}} PKU in Iceland since 1947. Incidence 1972 - 2008 is 1 / 8400 living births. Classic PKU is the most common presentation in Iceland. Patients diagnosed after screening started have normal intelligence. Age at initiation of therapy and S-Phe average values lower with time. 12 PAH mutation types have been found in Iceland. A novel Icelandic mutation, Y 377 fsdelT, did not respond to BH 4 <b>loading</b> <b>test.</b> <b>Two</b> patients responded to a BH 4 <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> and four other patients are likely to respond to BH 4 <b>loading</b> <b>test.</b> Conclusion: PKU incidence in Iceland is slightly higher than in neighboring countries.

These problems prohibited the steam turbine generator set from reaching full speed. Additional vibration problems were anticipated once the generator was loaded and the steam flows through the turbines increased. The first subsynchronous vibration problem, observed during initial full speed, no-load run attempts, was found to be most severe at the inboard generator bearing and the adjacent turbine bearing. The second problem, uncovered during analysis of the generator vibration problem, was the presence of low-level subsynchronous vibration at a different frequency on both bearings of the high pressure-intermediate pressure (HP-IP) turbine rotor. The concern was that this vibration would be exacerbated once the machine was loaded and additional aerodynamic cross-coupling was introduced by steam flow at seal and wheel locations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{preliminary results}} {{and analysis of}} a cantilever <b>load</b> <b>test</b> on <b>two</b> types hollow-core composite insulators and summarizes {{the response of the}} insulators to different types of loading. The tube of the insulator is a cylindrical shell of fibers-glass in a resin-based matrix with aluminum flange end fittings. The integrity of the tube-flange connection is checked for leaks, slip, damage, and bond degradation. Tests indicate that he actual cantilever load causing failure was much higher than the rated SML provided by the manufacturers. While there were occasionally sounds indicating that something {{was going on in the}} insulator prior to catastrophic failure, there was no change in the force deflection curve of the test. While there were slight changes in the damping and frequency of the insulators as the loading increased, the changes were small and did not indicate degradation of the insulator. Two failure modes were observed: failure of the lower flange and shear failure at the tube-flange connection. In one case the shear failure was in the bond to the flange and in the other it was in the tube adjacent to the bonding material. In the unbonded tube, there was clear friction damping. In bonded tubes, the presence of friction damping needs further investigatio...|$|R

The in-plane (or diaphragm) strength and stiffness {{of the floor}} system are frequently utilized in the lateral load-resisting system design. This paper {{presents the results of}} an experimental research program in which four full size composite diaphragms were vertically loaded to the limit state, under static or dynamic <b>loads.</b> <b>Two</b> <b>test</b> specimens were provided with longitudinal steel-deck ribs, and the other two specimens with cross steel-deck ribs. Typical composite diaphragm limit states are described, and the controlling limit state for each of the full size tests is indicated. The interaction effects between the reinforced concrete slab and the steel girder on the composite slab strength and stiffness were mainly studied...|$|R
