40|$|Figure 1 : Our {{camera and}} flash system offers dazzle-free {{photography}} by hiding the {{flash in the}} non-visible spectrum. A pair of images are captured at a blur-free shutter speed, one using a multi-spectral flash (F), the other using ambient illumination (A) {{which in this case}} is 1 / 100 th of that required for a correct exposure. The pair are combined to give an output image (R) which is of comparable quality to a reference <b>long</b> exposure <b>shot</b> (<b>L).</b> The figures in this paper are best viewed on screen, rather than in print. Camera flashes produce intrusive bursts of light that disturb or daz-zle. We present a prototype camera and flash that uses infra-red and ultra-violet light mostly outside the visible range to capture pictures in low-light conditions. This “dark ” flash is at least two orders of magnitude dimmer than conventional flashes for a comparable exposure. Building on ideas from flash/no-flash photography, we capture a pair of images, one using the dark flash, other using the dim ambient illumination alone. We then exploit the correlations between images recorded at different wavelengths to denoise the ambient image and restore fine details to give a high quality result, even in very weak illumination. The processing techniques {{can also be used to}} denoise images captured with conventional cameras...|$|R

50|$|Extreme <b>long</b> <b>shots</b> {{are usually}} {{done in a}} high angle so the viewer can look down upon a setting or scene. Extreme <b>longs</b> <b>shots</b> are used mainly to open the scene or {{narrative}} and show the viewer the setting. The rest of the shots are most typically done in an eye level or point of view shot although {{it is possible to}} do any shot with any angle.

40|$|This thesis {{wants to}} explore <b>long</b> <b>shots</b> {{alongside}} with stylization in cinema. 	Through three directors are explored possibility and problematic of cinematographic expression through <b>long</b> <b>shots</b> and stylization. Stylisation is connected mainly with mis-en-scène and particular {{aspects of it}} – acting, film decoration/props, film space, film sound, [...] . 	The terms stylisation and <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> (plan-séquence) are analysed and explored on its own and in the films of the chosen directors. 	The main analysed directors are Andrei Tarkovsky, Carl Th. Dreyer and Béla Tarr and their three films (in the same order) - Sacrifice, Gertrud and Satantango. 	The chosen directors are {{from my point of}} view the best example of the use of stylisation and <b>long</b> <b>shots</b> due to their artistic clarity and coherence. 	I try to base this work mostly on my own analysis and thoughts about <b>long</b> <b>shots</b> and stylisation based on the literature, films and my own film works, although I also use quotations from directors/authors and quotations from theoretical works. 	The thesis in its form is closest to the analytic and essay study...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Let T denote a cont inuous {{time horizon}} and {Gt:teT} be a net (generalized sequence) of Bayesian games. We show that: (i) if {xt: te T} is a net of Bayesian Nash Equi l ibr ium (BNE) {{strategies}} for G t, we can extract a subsequence which converges to a l imit full information BNE strategy for a one <b>shot</b> <b>l</b> imit full information Bayesian game. (ii) If {xt:t~T} is a net of approx imate or et-BNE {{strategies for the}} game G t we can still extract a subsequence which converges to the one <b>shot</b> <b>l</b> imit full information equi l ibr ium BNE strategy. (iii) Given a l imit full information BNE strategy of a one <b>shot</b> <b>l</b> imit full information Bayesian game, {{we can find a}} net of et-BNE strategies {xt:t~T} in {Gt:teT} which converges to the limit full information BNE strategy of the one shot game. 1...|$|R
