25|$|Due to {{increases}} in prize funds over the years, this list consists entirely of current players. Two players on the list, Vijay Singh and Davis <b>Love</b> <b>III,</b> are eligible for PGA Tour Champions (having respectively turned 50 in February 2013 and April 2014). Both have lifetime exemptions on the PGA Tour for 20 wins and 15 years on the Tour, and Love has won a tournament on the main PGA Tour since turning 50. The figures are not the players' complete career prize money as they do not include FedEx Cup bonuses, winnings from unofficial money events, or earnings on other tours such as the European Tour. In addition, elite golfers often earn several times as much from endorsements and golf-related business interests as they do from prize money.|$|E

2500|$|Less than a {{week after}} his passing, Palmer's life was also celebrated by both teams at the Ryder Cup at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minnesota, just outside the Twin Cities. The celebration {{included}} a video tribute and a moment of silence during the opening ceremony, which also included tributes from the opposing captains - Davis <b>Love</b> <b>III</b> for Team USA and Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke for Team Europe - and the opposing honorary captains - Nicklaus for Team USA and England's Tony Jacklin for Team Europe. During the matches, the players paid tribute to Palmer, which included wearing a special logo, button and pin. Palmer's bag from the 1975 Ryder Cup was also placed on the first tee as a tribute. Palmer had won more than 22 Ryder Cup matches and had also captained Team USA to two victories, in addition to holding or being tied for the records for youngest captain, most career singles points and most points in a single Ryder Cup.

2500|$|Despite his {{outstanding}} {{success on}} the PGA Tour, Woods had little success in the Ryder Cup early in his career. In his first Ryder Cup in 1997, he earned only 1½ points competing in every match and partnering mostly with Mark O'Meara. Costantino Rocca defeated Woods in his singles match. In 1999, he earned 2 points over every match {{with a variety of}} partners. In 2002, he lost both Friday matches, but, partnered with Davis <b>Love</b> <b>III</b> for both of Saturday's matches, won two points for the Americans, and was slated to anchor the Americans for the singles matches, both squads going into Sunday with 8 points. However, after the Europeans took an early lead, his match with Jesper Parnevik was rendered unimportant and they halved the match. In 2004, he was paired with Phil Mickelson on Friday but lost both matches, and only earned one point on Saturday. With the Americans facing a 5–11 deficit, he won the first singles match, but the team was not able to rally. In 2006, he was paired with Jim Furyk for all of the pairs matches, and they won two of their four matches. Woods won his singles match, one of only three Americans to do so that day. Woods missed the 2008 Ryder Cup competition altogether, as he was recovering from reconstructive surgery on his left knee. Despite Woods' absence, the United States team posted its largest margin of victory in the event since 1981. In 2010, Woods had a successful Ryder Cup going 3-1-0. He played all team matches with Steve Stricker and defeated Francesco Molinari 4&3 in his singles match where he made 9 birdies. However, Europe won in a very close match, 14.5 to 13.5. In 2012, paired again with Stricker, both players struggled going 0-3-0 together for the week. For {{the first time in his}} career, Woods would sit out a session in the Ryder Cup. Himself and Stricker were the only Americans who did not have a point going into the Sunday singles. In his singles match against Francesco Molinari, Woods was 1 up on the 18th fairway. After seeing Martin Kaymer clinch the Ryder Cup for Europe, Woods conceded the hole after missing his par putt. He would halve the match giving Europe the outright victory, and finish his week at 0-3-1.|$|E
