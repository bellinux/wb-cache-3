2500|$|Frontman James Veck-Gilodi {{has spoken}} {{at length about}} the themes of each song on the album, {{describing}} them as 'very personal and each is a small story that depicts {{a part of my}} life'. Much of the album is about nostalgia, underachievement and anxiety, which are all topics which are personal to him as he wrote all the lyrics for the album. The opening track [...] "The Past Six Years", from whose lyrics the album takes its title, is described as 'an ode to... not really achieving as much as we'd have liked'. The lyrics make reference to friends and fellow bands Lower Than Atlantis and Young Guns and how James feels 'a perpetual bitterness and jealousy towards them in terms of their achievements, {{despite the fact that they}} are close friends'. [...] "I'm a Bore, Mostly" [...] also deals with the topic of underachievement, with James explaining that the song is about 'the mundane daily routine I had when I was living in London. ...I couldn't deal with city life, I rarely left the house and found myself sinking into this terrible routine. I didn't really appreciate anything at the time and I had no enthusiasm'. He has claimed he wrote the song [...] "Filthy Rotten Scoundrel" [...] about himself; 'I need to learn to be grateful and appreciate the opportunities that I have been given. It's also about my fear of living, dying and never really achieving anything'. [...] "The World or Nothing" [...] continues this trend, with James describing the theme as 'the vicious cycle of feeling lost and resorting to the aid of alcohol while also feeling lost because of alcohol. It talks about how self-destructive a lot of us are and how we enjoy abusing our bodies'. Of [...] "Nelson's County", Veck-Gilodi has said: 'This song is about the county of Norfolk and how a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> reside there seem to have no real ambition other than working a 9-5, raising a family and living a normal life'.|$|E

Bolland and Gibbons became firm friends. After finishing his college course, Bolland was hit with [...] "the stark reality of unemployment" [...] and {{on the advice of}} Gibbons joined art agency Bardon Press Features. [...] "A few two-page strips" [...] for D.C. Thomson resulted, but Bolland would refer to this period as his [...] "lowest time." [...] Bardon did however produce a client called Pikin which was [...] "planning a bi-weekly comic about an African superhero," [...] Powerman, which was to be sold in Nigeria. Gibbons and Bolland were to draw alternate issues (Bolland's first issue was Powerman No. 2.), and Bolland recalls that [...] "soon Dave had drawn his entire story and I had produced just a few pages." [...] This knowledge – [...] "that Dave could produce a page a day... and that I {{was going to have to}} do the same" [...] – was a shock, but proved to be [...] "the very best kind of training ground." [...] With comics purportedly being new to Nigeria, Bolland recalls this work being created specifically to be [...] "really simple; six panels on a page and [...] the panels had to be numbered." [...] Not only was this work [...] "he best way to learn the simple rules of comic book storytelling," [...] but [...] "better still, it was going someplace where nobody I knew could see it." [...] He [...] "drew around 300 pages of that very straightforward, simple-to-follow work, and I guess the storytelling flowed naturally from that." [...] Even so, he [...] "was always struggling to get the last eight or ten pages finished," [...] and was occasionally helped by friends, both from his [...] "Norwich School of Art days," [...] Gibbons and future-2000 AD and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen artist Kevin O'Neill.|$|E

5000|$|We got Dennis Hopper {{somehow to}} be in it and I think there were {{something}} like 120 speaking parts and only $400,000 to make the film, which was very much in awe of Sam Peckinpah. We made a Western in Australia. And the film got selected for a side-bar event in Cannes; a film festival as usual came to my rescue. So I moved back to Europe having had the hands-on experience of making a film. The budget was made on a piece of paper, just page after page, and that is how the budget was constructed, never having made a film before, and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> worked on the film were complete amateurs.

40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] As {{more and more of}} the world's {{tropical}} rainforests are cut down, environmentalists have come up with a new idea to stop the destruction: marketing non-timber products from the rainforest. They argue that if Western consumers buy forest products such as "Rainforest Crunch" ice cream, cookies, cereal, or cosmetics, the forest will become too valuable for the native people to cut down. Most of the trees, however, are cut down not by native forest dwellers but by commercial loggers and ranchers and the migrants who follow them. Moreover, whenever a forest product becomes valuable in international markets, elites are likely to appropriate it and leave only products of little value to the forest dwellers. Marketing rainforest products is not only trying to protect the trees from the wrong people; it perpetuates the process of leaving to the forest dwellers the resources of least interest to the broader society. The focus on "green shopping" is a dangerous distraction from the political and economic changes that must be made to encourage conservation of the world's tropical forests and improve the <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> live there...|$|E
