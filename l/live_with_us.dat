2500|$|Germany and the Soviet Union {{discussed}} {{entering into}} an economic deal throughout early 1939. During {{spring and summer}} 1939, the Soviets negotiated a political and military pact with France and Britain, {{while at the same}} time talking with German officials about a potential political Soviet–German agreement. [...] On April 7, Soviet diplomat Georgii Astakhov stated to the German Foreign Ministry that there was no point in continuing the German–Soviet ideological struggle and that the two countries could come to an agreement. Ten days later, Soviet ambassador Alexei Merekalov met with German State Secretary Ernst Weizsacker and presented him a note requesting speedy removal of any obstacles for fulfillment of military contracts signed between Czechoslovakia and the USSR before the former was occupied by Germany. According to German accounts, at the end of the discussion the ambassador stated [...] "there exists for Russia no reason why she should not <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> on a normal footing. And from normal the relations might become better and better." [...] Other sources claim that it could be an exaggeration or inaccurate recounting of the ambassador's words. Immediately after the meeting, the Soviet ambassador had been withdrawn to Moscow and never returned to Germany.|$|E
2500|$|In 1948, the U.S. State Department {{published}} {{a collection of}} documents recovered from the Foreign Office of Nazi Germany, that formed a documentary base for studies of Nazi-Soviet relations. This collection contains the German State Secretary's account on a meeting with Soviet ambassador Merekalov. [...] This memorandum reproduces the following ambassador's statement: [...] "'there exists for Russia no reason why she should not <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> on a normal footing. And from normal the relations might become better and better." [...] According to Carr, this document is the first recorded Soviet step in the rapprochement with Germany. The next documentary evidence is the memorandum on the May 17 meeting between the Soviet ambassador and German Foreign Office official, where the ambassador [...] "stated in detail {{that there were no}} conflicts in foreign policy between Germany and Soviet Russia and that therefore {{there was no reason for}} any enmity between the two countries." [...] The third document is the summary of the May 20 meeting between Molotov and German ambassador von der Schulenburg. [...] According to the document, Molotov told the German ambassador that he no longer wanted to discuss only economic matters, and that it was necessary to establish a [...] "political basis", which German officials saw as an [...] "implicit invitation." [...] The last document is the German State Office memorandum on the telephone call made [...] on June 17 by Bulgarian ambassador Draganov. In German accounts of Draganov's report, Astakhov explained that a Soviet deal with Germany better suited the Soviets than one with Britain and France, although from the Bulgarian ambassador it [...] "could not be ascertained whether it had reflected the personal opinions of Herr Astakhov or the opinions of the Soviet Government".|$|E

2500|$|On April 7, a Soviet diplomat {{visited the}} German Foreign Ministry stating {{that there was}} no point in {{continuing}} the German-Soviet ideological struggle and that the countries could conduct a concerted policy. Ten days later, the Soviet ambassador Alexei Merekalov met Ernst von Weizsäcker, the number two man at the Auswärtiges Amt and presented him a note requesting speedy removal of any obstacles for fulfillment of military contracts signed between Czechoslovakia and the USSR before the former was occupied by Germany. According to German accounts, at the end of the discussion, the ambassador stated [...] "'there exists for Russia no reason why she should not <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> on a normal footing. And from normal the relations might become better and better." [...] though other sources admit that it could be an exaggeration or inaccurate recounting of the ambassador's words. Immediately after that, the Soviet ambassador had been withdrawn to Moscow and never returned to Germany. According to Ulam, future conversations on the topic in Berlin were believed to continue with lower level officials working under the cover of a Soviet trade mission. Starting on 14 April 1939 and continuing right up to August 1939, the German embassy in London received anonymously copies of British diplomatic cables to and from Moscow, detailing London's attempts to have the Soviet Union join the anti-German [...] "peace front". The Foreign Office's diplomatic telegrams were selectively edited to make it sound like that Anglo-Soviet relations were far better than they actually were, and that the talks were going much better than what was the case. The German ambassador to the court of St. James, Herbert von Dirksen judged the cables credible and passed them along in his reports to Berlin. As the Germans could not break the Foreign Office's codes nor did the Abwehr have an agent with access to the Foreign Office's codes, these intercepted cables were not the work of German intelligence. In fact, these cables that sent to the German embassy in London were the work of the NKVD, which had broken the British codes, and seeking to pressure the Reich to come to terms with the Soviet Union [...]|$|E
