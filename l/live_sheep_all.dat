40|$|A {{total of}} 59 Pseudomonas {{isolates}} {{was obtained from}} 11 samples of diseased fleece taken from <b>live</b> <b>sheep.</b> <b>All</b> but four of the isolates could be {{assigned to one of}} nine Pseudomonas species, of which P. aeruginosa, P. alcaligenes, P. mendocina, and P. putida were the most common. P. aeruginosa was found in four of the fleece samples and, when present, appeared to predominate. Although several of the isolates of P. aeruginosa lacked the ability to produce pyocyanin (and some produced neither pyocyanin nor fluorescein), nearly all produced several virulence factors. Of the other pseudomonads, many produced proteinase, esterase, and catalase, several were able to grow at 42 degrees C and reduce nitrate, and some also produced lipase and hemolysin and, like P. aeruginosa, might serve to initiate (or sustain) the dermatitis frequently associated with fleece rot in sheep...|$|E

40|$|Sheep {{farming is}} an {{important}} enterprise in the U. S. S. R., Mongolia {{and some of the}} Eastern European countries. The U. S. S. R., in fact, has the largest number of sheep in the world, though production is considerably lower than that of the Oceanic countries, and is generally insufficient to satisfy domestic demand. Trade in sheep products is becoming more important for all the Eastern European countries. The U. S. S. R. has an increasing, though irregular import demand, which consists largely of mutton from N. Z. and Australia. Hungary, Bulgaria and Rumania have growing exports of both <b>live</b> <b>sheep</b> and sheep meats sold mainly to the E. E. C., but with increasing amounts going to the Middle East. Mongolia has a large, stable export trade in <b>live</b> <b>sheep,</b> the majority of which are sold to other East European countries.

40|$|AbstractThe {{livestock}} {{sector of}} Sudan provides livelihood for about 17 % of the population. Sudanese livestock products meet the domestic demand for meat {{in addition to}} a substantial excess for export amounting to about 22 % of total country exports. It contributes about 19 % of GDP. Sheep marketing in Sudan is characterised by traditional operations and is informally organised, although, recently there are great efforts by the formal livestock authorities to organise some secondary and terminal livestock markets. These markets are deficient in basic infrastructures and systematic marketing research. The system as a whole is faced by various complex obstacles and constraints, which decrease the contribution of livestock in general, and sheep in particular, to the national economy, and suppress the optimum exploitation of this resource. These obstacles are represented in the lack of transportation networks that connect the production and consumption centres to break the seasonality of supply that creates shortages and high prices at the consumption centres. This paper employs the policy analysis matrix (PAM) technique to examine the Sudanese <b>live</b> <b>sheep</b> and mutton competitiveness in the international market. The results indicated that the market price was greater than the border price implying a positive incentive as an implicit subsidy to the <b>live</b> <b>sheep</b> exporter. The mutton exporters were found subsidised as well. The international value added (IVA) indicted a positive foreign exchange earnings or savings. Exported <b>live</b> <b>sheep</b> and mutton coefficient of competitiveness (CIC) implied that sheep and mutton exports are profitable and internationally competitive...|$|R
