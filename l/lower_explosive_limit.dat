25|$|Like other hydrocarbons, {{gasoline}} {{burns in}} a limited range of its vapor phase and, coupled with its volatility, this makes leaks highly dangerous when sources of ignition are present. Gasoline has a <b>lower</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> of 1.4% by volume and an upper explosive limit of 7.6%. If the concentration is below 1.4%, the air-gasoline mixture is too lean and does not ignite. If the concentration is above 7.6%, the mixture is too rich and also does not ignite. However, gasoline vapor rapidly mixes and spreads with air, making unconstrained gasoline quickly flammable.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} small energy, often {{as little as}} 0.2–2 millijoules, is needed to ignite a flammable mixture of a fuel and air. For the common industrial hydrocarbon gases and solvents, the minimum ignition energy required for ignition of vapor-air mixture is lowest for the vapor concentration roughly in the middle between the <b>lower</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> and the upper explosive limit, and rapidly increases as the concentration deviates from this optimum to either side. Aerosols of flammable liquids may be ignited well below their flash point. Generally, liquid aerosols with particle sizes below 10 micrometers behave like vapors, particle sizes above 40 micrometers behave more like flammable dusts. Typical minimum flammable concentrations of aerosols lay between 15 and 50 g/m3. Similarly, presence of foam {{on the surface of}} a flammable liquid significantly increases ignitability. Aerosol of flammable dust can be ignited as well, resulting in a dust explosion; the <b>lower</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> usually lies between 50 and 1000 g/m3; finer dusts tend to be more explosive and requiring less spark energy to set off. Simultaneous presence of flammable vapors and flammable dust can significantly decrease the ignition energy; a mere 1 vol.% of propane in air can reduce the required ignition energy of dust by 100 times. Higher than normal oxygen content in atmosphere also significantly lowers the ignition energy.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Lower</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> (LEL): The lowest {{concentration}} (percentage) {{of a gas}} or a vapor in air {{capable of}} producing a flash of fire in presence of an ignition source (arc, flame, heat). The term {{is considered by many}} safety professionals to be the same as the lower flammable limit (LFL). [...] At a concentration in air lower than the LEL, gas mixtures are [...] "too lean" [...] to burn.|$|E
25|$|Dusts {{also have}} {{upper and lower}} {{explosion}} limits, though the upper limits are hard to measure and of little practical importance. <b>Lower</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> for many organic materials {{are in the range}} of 1050g/m³, which is much higher than the limits set for health reasons, as is the case for the LEL of many gases and vapours. Dust clouds of this concentration are hard to see through for more than a short distance, and normally only exist inside process equipment.|$|R
50|$|Explosive atmospheres have {{different}} chemical properties {{that affect the}} likelihood and severity of an explosion. Such properties include flame temperature, minimum ignition energy, upper and <b>lower</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limits,</b> and molecular weight. Empirical testing is done to determine parameters such as the maximum experimental safe gap (MESG), minimum igniting current (MIC) ratio, explosion pressure and time to peak pressure, spontaneous ignition temperature, and maximum rate of pressure rise.

40|$|Theoretical {{models to}} predict the upper/lower <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> of a mixture {{composed}} of hydrocarbon and inert carbon dioxide (CO 2) are proposed in this study. It is found theoretically that there are linear relations between the reciprocal of the upper/lower flammability limits and the reciprocal of the molar fraction of hydrocarbon in the hydrocarbon/inert gas mixture. These theoretical linear relations are examined by existing experimental results reported in the literature, which include the cases of methane. The experiments were performed in a 20 L closed explosion vessel. The mixtures were ignited by using spark permanent wire that placed at {{the centre of the}} vessel. Inthis study, the result shows the <b>lower</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> (LEL) and upper <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> (UEL) is from 5 vol% to 20 vol% of methane (CH 4) and have revealed that the addition of suppression agent as 5 vol% and 10 vol% carbon dioxide (CO 2) in methane extends the lower LEL and UEL initially 9 vol% to 18 vol% and 3 vol% to 16 vol%...|$|R
2500|$|Cars {{can build}} up static charge by driving on dry road surfaces. However many tire {{compounds}} contain enough carbon black {{to provide an}} electrical ground which prevents charge build-up. Newer [...] "high mileage" [...] tires use more silica and can increase the buildup of static. A driver who does not discharge static by contacting a conductive part of the car will carry it to the insulated handle of the nozzle and the static potential will eventually be discharged when this purposely-grounded arrangement is put {{into contact with the}} metallic filler neck of the vehicle. Ordinarily, vapor concentrations in the area of this filling operation are below the <b>lower</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> (LEL) of the product being dispensed, so the static discharge causes no problem. The problem with ungrounded gas cans results from a combination of vehicular static charge, the potential between the container and the vehicle, and the loose fit between the grounded nozzle and the gas can. This last condition causes a rich vapor concentration in the ullage (the unfilled volume) of the gas can, and a discharge from the can to the grounded hanging hardware (the nozzle, hose, swivels and break-a-ways) can thus occur at a most inopportune point. The Petroleum Equipment Institute has recorded incidents of static-related ignition at refueling sites since early 2000.|$|E

Mine rescue guidelines make recommendations about the limits {{in terms of the}} circumstances, lives at risk, no lives at risk and training exercises. These are based upon percentages of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limits.</b> Many factors influence setting limits for safe re-entry. These include: the representativeness of the sampling location(s), the rapidity of getting an underground sample analysed and the rate of change of the atmosphere being monitored. Value judgements based upon these parameters will then influence the setting of a trigger point based upon per cent explosibility. This raises the question of how the percentage of the <b>lower</b> or upper <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> is established. It is easy to define this when the sampling point data sit on the fresh air limit line. However - what value is used when the sample sits somewhere in the body of an explosibility diagram?

5000|$|Whether {{a mixture}} of air and gas is {{combustible}} depends on the air-to-fuel ratio. For each fuel, ignition occurs only within the explosive range (i.e. the <b>Lower</b> and upper <b>explosive</b> <b>limits).</b> For example, for methane and gasoline vapor, the explosive range is 5-15% and 1.3-6.0% gas to air, respectively.|$|R

The gas sensing properties of the SnO 2 films were investigated using liquid petroleum gas (LPG) for various <b>lower</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> (LEL).

40|$|Mter a methane {{explosion}} in a coal mine a pre-determined crisis management procedure is instigated. As the process rapidly evolves the inevitable question arises -are personnel trapped underground, are they alive and {{can they be}} rescued without putting {{the lives of the}} rescue crew at risk? This is a very emotive question with many sub-questions such as; could anybody have survived, is there the potential for a secondary explosion and is there a 2 ̆ 7 window of opportunity 2 ̆ 7 before that secondary explosion occurs? To detemline if that window of opportunity exists two fundamental elements must be in place; a method of determining the atmosphere at key points in the mine and a method of predicting the course of change of that atmosphere with respect to time. The first element can be achieved if the tube bundle system is intact and drawing samples from known points, alternatively boreholes can be drilled from the surface. The second element can be realised by utilising a sequence of computer generated control charts which have a time axis, a percentage combustibles axis, the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> of the cUITent atmosphere and a prediction option which allows the user to look at the potential changes in the atmosphere over a set period of time.

40|$|The Safety Analysis Report for the TRUPACT-II Shipping Package [Transuranic Package Transporter-II (TRUPACT-II) SARP] {{set limits}} for gas {{generation}} rates, wattage limits, and flammable {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) concentrations in transuranic (TRU) waste containers that would be shipped to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Based on existing headspace gas data for drums stored at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) and the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS), over 30 percent of the contact-handled TRU waste drums contain flammable VOC concentrations greater than the limit. Additional requirements may be imposed for emplacement of waste in the WIPP facility. The conditional no-migration determination (NMD) for the test phase of the facility required that flame tests be performed if significant levels of flammable VOCs were present in TRU waste containers. This paper describes an approach for investigating the potential flammability of TRU waste drums, which would increase the allowable concentrations of flammable VOCS. A flammability assessment methodology is presented that will allow more drums to be shipped to WIPP without treatment or repackaging and {{reduce the need for}} flame testing on drums. The approach includes experimental work to determine mixture <b>lower</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> (MLEL) for the types of gas mixtures observed in TRU waste, a model for predicting the MLEL for mixtures of VOCS, hydrogen, and methane, and revised screening limits for total flammable VOCs concentrations and concentrations of hydrogen and methane using existing drum headspace gas data and the model predictions...|$|R
40|$|About 700 remote-handled {{transuranic}} (RH-TRU) {{waste drums}} {{are stored in}} about 144 underground vaults at the Intermediate-Level Transuranic Storage Facility at the Idaho National Environmental and Engineering Laboratory’s (INEEL’s) Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC). These drums were shipped to the INEEL from 1976 through 1996. During recent monitoring, concentrations of hydrogen {{were found to be}} in excess of <b>lower</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>limits.</b> The hydrogen concentration in one vault was detected to be as high as 18 % (by volume). This condition required evaluation of the safety basis for the facility. The INEEL has developed a computer program to estimate the hydrogen gas generation as a function of time and diffusion through a series of layers (volumes), with a maximum five layers plus a sink/environment. The program solves the first-order diffusion equations as a function of time. The current version of the code is more flexible in terms of user input. The program allows the user to estimate hydrogen concentrations in the different layers of a configuration and then change the configuration after a given time; e. g.; installation of a filter on an unvented drum or placed in a vault or in a shipping cask. The code has been used to predict vault concentrations and to identify potential problems during retrieval and aboveground storage. The code has generally predicted higher hydrogen concentrations than the measured values, particularly for the drums older than 20 year, which could be due to uncertainty and conservative assumptions in drum age, heat generation rate, hydrogen generation rate, Geff, and diffusion rates through the layers...|$|R
