40|$|Several {{kinds of}} defects {{that occur in}} bottle {{industry}} will reduce efficiency of bottle production. The defective bottle products are caused by several factors, such as human error, compositions, faults in temperature and machinery setting. From such those errors, faults in temperature and machinery setting often occur during bottle fabrication. This research aims to simulate bottle fabrication by using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) and being used to predict <b>loading</b> <b>mark</b> bottle defect.

40|$|Memory {{operations}} {{remain a}} significant bottleneck in dynamically scheduled pipelined processors, {{due in part}} to the inability to statically determine the existence of memory address dependencies. Hardware memory renaming techniques have been proposed to predict which stores a load might be dependent upon. These prediction techniques can be used to speculatively forward a value from a predicted store dependency to a load through a value prediction table. However, these techniques require large, timeconsuming hardware tables. In this paper we propose a software-guided approach for identifying dependencies between store and load instructions and the <b>Load</b> <b>Marking</b> (LM) architecture to communicate these dependencies to the hardware. Compiler analysis and profiles are used to find important store/load relationships, and these relationships are identified during execution via hints or an n-bit tag. For those loads that are not marked for renaming, we then use additional profiling information [...] ...|$|R

25|$|The keels were wooden boats with {{a pointed}} stern, {{so that the}} bow and stern looked almost the same. They were of shallow draught so that when fully loaded they drew only {{four and a half}} feet. The keels were forty feet long and at least 19 feet wide amidships: a very broad configuration. In 1266 the {{standard}} load of a keel was set at 20 chaldrons (wagonloads) or approximately 17 tons. After 1497 the keel load was frequently increased, until in 1635 it was set at 21.1 tons. A chaldron was a horse-drawn wagon containing 17 cwt of coal. Keels were supposed to be measured by the Kings Commissioners and given a <b>load</b> <b>mark</b> to show when they were full. The keels had a single mast with a square sail attached to a yardarm and two large oars. They had no rudder and so a large sweep was used for steering when the keel was under sail. The oars were used to row when the wind was not favourable. There were also two iron-shod poles for polling the keel through any shallows. The floor of the hold was only two feet below the gunwale to allow for easy loading. The coal was piled high above the top of the hold with wooden boards used to prevent the cargo from sliding. Each keel was manned by a skipper, two crewmen and a boy, known as a ‘pee dee’. The meaning of this title is unknown.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{development}} of new machine tool concepts, gear honing {{has turned out to be}} a competitive process for exclusive machining of hardened gears. In Coroning or gear honing with electroplated diamond tools respectively, very low cutting speeds have to be mentioned as outstanding characteristics. Low thermal and high mechanical loads emerge which lead to high compressive residual stresses in the subsurface of gear flanks. Thermal damage can be avoided with high reliability and under all conditions. In addition, the process has high economic potential as exemplary comparisons of machining costs to reference processes have shown. The properties of the surface and the surface near material have turned out to be almost independent of a variation of process parameters. The specification of diamond tools constitutes one important parameter as an increase of the grain size effects increasing flank roughness. The diamond tools achieve high tool life quantity. Whereas the properties of the surface and the surface near material continuously improve iwth increasing tool wear, increasing tooth form errors and mechanical <b>loads</b> <b>mark</b> the criterions for end of tool life. Among the properties of the surface and the surface near material, the roughness exerts the main influence on pitting formation: With increasing flank roughness, a decrease of pitting life occurs.
