So, but then I thought about it and I said, you know what? James Bond needs to get – needs to get techno so...|$|E

Iona Kirby of Daily Mail praised the documentary-style video, which gives fans {{an opportunity to}} see the life of Rihanna and insight into what she <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> A reviewer from Rap-Up praised the video, commenting that it is a [...] "real blast in a glass!"

[...] Robbie Daw of Idolator commented that the music video looks [...] "like one big, drunken night out." [...] A reviewer from Rolling Stone magazine also commented that the video [...] "finds Rihanna in an appropriately celebratory mood..... it's mostly a lot of shots of her partying backstage with friends and celebrities." [...] Sarah Maloy of Billboard magazine commented [...] "there are no special effects, storylines – and no chance of lawsuits," [...] referring to one of Rihanna's previous music videos, [...] "S", which was faced with two lawsuits. Maloy also noted that the video presents Rihanna's ordinary life just as it is.|$|E

He went ashore in command of the naval brigade and {{distinguished}} himself in the actions which followed. During his time in the Crimea he met and became friends with Frances [...] "Fanny" [...] Duberly, arranging for a hut to be built for her to allow her to live on shore. Fanny Duberly recorded of Lushington that [...] "I like him because he is clever, energetic & resolute and I am not afraid of him when he chooses to say disagreeable personalities which he sometimes <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to shew off his sharpness." [...] Lushington for his part teased her by calling her [...] "wilful and wayward".|$|E
2500|$|The di Marcos {{remained}} {{with the show}} as a unit until 2000, when the new executive producer, John Yorke, decided to cull {{the majority of the}} family. All except Beppe (Michael Greco) and his son Joe (Jake Kyprianou) were written out. They were reportedly [...] "slaughtered because of a shortage of ideas for what to do with them". A source allegedly told The Mirror: [...] "It's always unpleasant having to say goodbye to people who have given loyal service to the show for a number of years. But John Yorke feels it's time to make his mark on the show. Every new producer <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same. John wants to introduce a new family later this year and felt the Di Marcos had nowhere else to go. Their storylines were beginning to feel tired and that's a good time to make such a drastic change...There is a lot of sympathy for actress Louise Jameson because her character was two-dimensional from the start. Nagging, moaning mums are not viewer-friendly. There was nothing sexy or appealing about Rosa through no fault of Louise." ...|$|E

2500|$|State media started {{describing}} Ai as a [...] "deviant and a plagiarist" [...] {{in early}} 2011. The China Daily subsidiary, the Global Times editorial on 6 April 2011 attacked Ai, saying [...] "Ai Weiwei <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something 'others dare not do.' He has {{been close to}} the red line of Chinese law. Objectively speaking, Chinese society does not have much experience in dealing with such persons. However, as long as Ai Weiwei continuously marches forward, he will inevitably touch the red line one day." [...] Two days later, the journal scorned Western media for questioning Ai's charge as a [...] "catch-all crime", and denounced {{the use of his}} political activism as a [...] "legal shield" [...] against everyday crimes. It said [...] "Ai's detention {{is one of the many}} judicial cases handled in China every day. It is pure fantasy to conclude that Ai's case will be handled specially and unfairly." [...] Frank Ching expressed in the South China Morning Post that how the Global Times could radically shift its position from one-day to the next was reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the soundtrack}} to Ring of Fates, Tanioka {{tried to focus}} on [...] "creating a new {{landscape}} containing the same atmosphere". She returned to using instruments in an [...] "ethnic manner" [...] again in composing the soundtrack for Echoes of Time. The piano performances in the Ring of Fates soundtrack were done by Kumi Tanioka. She did the performances herself rather than use an outside performer as most Final Fantasy soundtracks have done primarily because she [...] "likes to play piano", and they were done without any sheet music, as she preferred instead to improvise. She took extensive piano lessons as a child, and lists piano and choral music as the biggest influences on her musical style. She also claims to have been influenced by music {{from a wide variety of}} cultures, like Indonesian, Irish and Balinese music. Tanioka has performed live at several events, including 2011's Final Fantasy XI-themed VanaCon; she <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> live performances as she feels it connects her with the listener's response to her music, unlike when composing where she can only imagine audience's responses to hearing her music.|$|E
