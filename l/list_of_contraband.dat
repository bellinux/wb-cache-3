5000|$|The British—with their {{overwhelming}} sea power—established a naval {{blockade of}} Germany immediately on {{the outbreak of}} war in August 1914, issuing a comprehensive <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> that all but prohibited American trade with the Central powers, and in early November 1914 declared the North Sea to be a War Zone, with any ships entering the North Sea doing so at their own risk. The blockade was unusually restrictive in that even foodstuffs were considered [...] "contraband of war". There were complaints about breaches of international law, however most neutral merchant vessels agreed to dock at British ports to be inspected and then escorted—less any [...] "illegal" [...] cargo destined for Germany—through the British minefields to their destinations.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{treaties}} defining contraband {{have been}} concluded among nations. In time of war, the nations involved have invariably violated the agreements, formulating their own definitions as {{the fortunes of}} war indicated. The Declaration of London, drafted at the London Naval Conference of 1908-1909 and made partly effective {{by most of the}} European maritime nations at the outbreak of World War I, established comprehensive classifications of absolute and conditional contraband. As the war developed, the <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> articles in each category were constantly revised by the various belligerents despite protests by neutral powers engaged in the carrying trade. By 1916, the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> conditional <b>contraband</b> included practically all waterborne cargo. Thereafter, for the duration of World War I, nearly all cargo in transit to an enemy nation was treated as <b>contraband</b> <b>of</b> war by the intercepting belligerent, regardless {{of the nature of the}} cargo. A similar policy was inaugurated by the belligerent powers early in World War II.|$|R
5000|$|The {{day after}} the declaration, the British Admiralty {{announced}} that all merchant vessels were now liable to examination by the naval Contraband Control Service and by the French Blockade Ministry, which put its ships under British command. Because of the terrible suffering and starvation caused by the original use of the strategy, a formal declaration of blockade was deliberately not made, but the communiqué <b>listed</b> the types <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> <b>of</b> war that was liable for confiscation if carried. It included all kinds of foodstuffs, animal feed, forage, and clothing, and articles and materials used in their production. This was known as Conditional <b>Contraband</b> <b>of</b> War.

40|$|Abstract—At {{issue for}} any {{organization}} is the illicit dissemination of sensitive information using file sharing applications within a network, and tracking terrorist cells or criminal {{organizations that are}} covertly communicating using Voice over IP (VoIP) applications. This paper presents a {{field programmable gate array}} (FPGA) -based embedded software tool designed to process file transfers using the BitTorrent peer-to-peer protocol and VoIP phone calls made using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The tool searches a network in real time for selected peer-to-peer control messages using payload analysis and compares the unique identifier of the file being shared or phone number being used against a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> known <b>contraband</b> files or phone numbers. If the identifier is found on the list, the control packet is added to a log file for later forensic analysis. Results show that the FPGA tool processes peer-to-peer packets of interest 92 % faster than a software-only configuration and is 99. 0 % accurate at capturing and processing BitTorrent Handshake messages under a network traffic load of at least 89. 6 Mbps. When SIP is added to the system, the probability of intercept for BitTorrent Handshake messages remains at 99. 0 % and the probability of intercept for SIP control packets is 97. 6 % under a network traffic load of at least 89. 6 Mbps, demonstrating that the tool can be expanded to process additional protocols with minimal impact on overall performance.

40|$|Abstract Background The sale <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> tobacco {{allows for}} tobacco tax evasion, which can {{undermine}} {{the effectiveness of}} tobacco tax policies in {{reducing the number of}} smokers. Estimates of the proportion <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> vary widely as do the methods used to measure the proportion <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> being smoked. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the proportion <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> use in two different jurisdictions. Methods A cross-sectional direct collection of cigarette butts was conducted in Peel and Brantford, Ontario, Canada in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Cigarette butts were collected from a variety of locations within both regions. Cigarette butts were assessed and classified into one of the following categories: contraband, legal Canadian, legal Native, International, unknown, and discards. Results The overall proportion <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> cigarettes in Peel was 5. 3  %, ranging from 2. 8 to 8. 6  % by location. In Brantford, the proportion <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> was 33. 0  %, with a range from 32. 8 to 33. 1  % by location. Conclusions The direct collection of cigarette butts was determined to be a feasible method for a local public health unit in determining the proportion <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> cigarettes. This approach showed that Brantford has a higher proportion <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> consumption compared to Peel, which may be due to geographic location and proximity to the United States (US) -Canada border and Native Reserves. More research is needed to confirm this geographic association with other jurisdictions...|$|R

Once in Alexandria, the contrabands were housed in barracks and hastily assembled shantytowns. In the close quarters with poor sanitation, smallpox and typhoid outbreaks were prevalent and death was common. In February 1864, after hundreds <b>of</b> <b>contrabands</b> and freedmen had perished, {{the commander of}} the Alexandria military district, General John P. Slough, seized a parcel of undeveloped land at the corner of South Washington and Church Streets from a pro-Confederate owner {{to be used as a}} cemetery specifically for burial <b>of</b> <b>contrabands.</b> Burials started in March that year.|$|R

40|$|In Ontario 27 % {{of young}} adults smoke, and annual {{surveillance}} data suggests tobacco use is plateauing after years of decline. The availability <b>of</b> inexpensive <b>contraband</b> tobacco products maybe contributing to this situation. Limited {{research has been conducted}} on the use <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> tobacco and despite the increasing availability <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> 'Native cigarettes', no studies to date have examined their use among young adults. Accordingly, this study examines: (a) what proportion of cigarette butts discarded on post-secondary campuses are contraband; and (b) whether the proportion <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> butts varies between colleges and universities, across seven geographical regions in the province and based on proximity First Nations reserves. In March and April 2009, discarded cigarette butts were collected from the grounds of 25 post-secondary institutions across Ontario. At each school, cigarette butts were collected on a single day from four locations. The collected cigarette butts were reliably sorted into five categories according to their filtertip logos: legal, contraband First NationslNative cigarettes, international and suspected counterfeit cigarettes, unidentifiable and unknown. Contraband use was apparent on all campuses, but varied considerably from school to school. Data suggest that contraband Native cigarettes account for as little as 1 % to as much as 38 % of the total cigarette consumption at a particular school. The highest proportion <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> was found on campuses in the Northern part of the province. Consumption <b>of</b> Native <b>contraband</b> was generally higher on colleges compared to universities. The presence <b>of</b> <b>contraband</b> tobacco on all campuses suggests that strategies to reduce smoking among young adults must respond to this cohort's use of these products...|$|R
