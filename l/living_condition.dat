40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} the spatial distribution of neonatal mortality and <b>living</b> <b>conditions,</b> and to analyze trends in the social inequalities, related to this mortality, in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, 2000 - 2006. Methods: The city's Information Zones, {{the unit of analysis}} used in this study, were grouped into strata reflecting high, intermediate, low and very low <b>living</b> <b>conditions,</b> based on a <b>living</b> <b>conditions</b> index (LCI). Neonatal mortality rates were calculated for each stratum. Spearman's correlation, linear regression and relative risks were used in the data analysis. Results: Neonatal mortality in Salvador was found to be associated with <b>living</b> <b>conditions,</b> with risks of 53, 56 and 59 % greater, respectively, in the intermediate, low and very low strata, when compared to the high <b>living</b> <b>conditions</b> stratum. Only the intermediate <b>living</b> <b>conditions</b> stratum shows a significant decline in neonatal mortality (&# 206;&# 178; = - 0. 93; p = 0. 039). In the stratum of high <b>living</b> <b>conditions,</b> it was observed a stagnation of this mortality. Conclusions: Poorer <b>living</b> <b>conditions</b> were associated to higher risks of neonatal mortality. The slight decline in social inequalities, found in neonatal mortality, was due to a decline in the intermediate <b>living</b> <b>conditions</b> stratum. Although dependent on the access to quality healthcare services and life support technologies, a more consistent reduction in the neonatal mortality and its associated inequalities will only be achieved when broader-reaching public policies are implemented, improving the <b>living</b> <b>conditions,</b> and mainly focusing on priority groups...|$|R

Furthermore, the Internet Addiction Test scores were significantly predicted by the anxiety caused by high -density <b>living</b> <b>conditions</b> (P =  0.000) and self-control (P =  0.000). Among male participants, {{not only were the}} binge eating scores significantly predicted by the anxiety caused by high-density <b>living</b> <b>conditions</b> (P =  0.000) and self-control (P =  0.000), but the frequency of compensatory behaviors was also significantly predicted by the anxiety caused by high-density <b>living</b> <b>conditions</b> (P =  0.000) and self-control (P =  0.01). Furthermore, Internet Addiction Test scores were significantly predicted by anxiety caused by high-density <b>living</b> <b>conditions</b> (P =  0.000) and self-control (P =  0.000). It was further found that for both genders, subjective factors such as self-control, and the anxiety caused by high-density <b>living</b> <b>conditions</b> had a stronger impact on Internet addiction than objective factors, such as the size of the student’s dormitory room. Moreover, self-control was found to act as a moderator in the relationship between anxiety and Internet addiction among male participants.|$|R

40|$|Extended {{version of}} a paper {{presented}} in ACSEG 2000 conference in Paris (dec 2000) International audienceIn the analysis of poverty and social exclusion, indicators of <b>living</b> <b>conditions</b> are some interesting non-monetary complements to the usual measurements in terms of current or annual income. Living conditions depend in fact on longer term factors than income, and provide further information on households' actual resources that allow to compare more accurately between living standards. But in counterpart, a difficulty comes from the qualitative nature of the information, and {{the large number of}} dimensions and items that may be taken into account; in other words, <b>living</b> <b>conditions</b> are difficult to “measure”. A consequence is that very often, the information is either used only partly, or reduced into a global score of (bad) <b>living</b> <b>conditions,</b> that results from counting “negative” items, and the qualitative dimension is lost. In this paper, we propose to use the Kohonen algorithm first to describe how the elements of <b>living</b> <b>conditions</b> are combined, and secondly to classify households according to their <b>living</b> <b>conditions.</b> The main interest of a classification is to make appear not only quantitative differences in the “levels” of <b>living</b> <b>conditions,</b> but also qualitative differences within similar “levels”...|$|R
