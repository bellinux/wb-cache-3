40|$|Expanding on {{techniques}} of concentration of measure, we develop a quantitative framework for modeling liquidity risk using convex risk measures. The fundamental objects of study are curves {{of the form}} (ρ(λ X)) _λ> 0, where ρ is a convex risk measure and X a random variable, and we call such a curve a <b>liquidity</b> risk <b>profile.</b> The shape of a <b>liquidity</b> risk <b>profile</b> is intimately linked with the tail behavior of the underlying X for some notable classes of risk measures, namely shortfall risk measures. We exploit this link to systematically bound <b>liquidity</b> risk <b>profiles</b> from above by other real functions γ, deriving tractable necessary and sufficient conditions for concentration inequalities of the form ρ(λ X) 0. These concentration inequalities admit useful dual representations related to transport inequalities, and this leads to efficient uniform bounds for <b>liquidity</b> risk <b>profiles</b> for large classes of X. On the other hand, some modest new mathematical results emerge from this analysis, including a new characterization of some classical transport-entropy inequalities.

40|$|Recent {{economic}} turmoil {{has forced}} institutional investment firms to place {{more emphasis on}} liquidity. Firms such as banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, endowments, and pension funds all face {{a unique set of}} liquidity risk factors. There are several methods for measuring liquidity risk available to firms. However, these measures are subject to interpretation errors as well as errors in definition. Institutional investment firms need to understand liquidity risk measures as well as the factors that are involved in determining these measures. Firms can only manage their liquidity risk if they understand the risks that they are subject to and how to measure that risk. Liquidity risk management techniques that are viable for certain firms may not pertain to others. Regulatory requirements as well as firm-specific <b>liquidity</b> <b>profiles</b> are also important factors in determining the appropriate methods of quantifying and managing liquidity risk. This paper analyzes the <b>liquidity</b> risk <b>profile</b> of banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, endowments, and pension funds and offers several liquidity measures that can be utilized by firms. I suggest measures that may be more applicable to certain firms. There is also a discussion of the immunization technique for liquidity risk management. While this technique is not always applicable, it is powerful in managing liquidity risk. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} 2009, {{countries}} in the Eurozone began to experience a sudden divergence of bond yields as the perceived prospect of sovereign default risk increased. This paper examines the potential spillovers between the liquidity of the sovereign credit default swap (CDS) market and the liquidity of the sovereign bond market {{for a group of}} Eurozone countries. Empirically, we consider the differential spread on various Eurozone members sovereign bonds over the equivalent German benchmark. Using a unique dataset, constructed from the tick by tick transaction history from the 5 - 10 year maturity of the sovereign bond and CDS markets, we find that for countries such as Portugal, Spain and Ireland, the CDS market reveals a growing influence on bond yields post 2009. We provide substantial evidence that Greek sovereign CDS spreads and debt spreads do not exhibit the same time varying correlative patterns. Furthermore, we suggest that CDS spreads and bond credit spreads for Greek debt have correctly priced the default risk and that the trend patterns observed have not been substantially affected by changes in the <b>liquidity</b> <b>profiles</b> of either market. On a general note, we show that the bond yield liquidity spreads have increased substantially over the 2007 - 2010 period whilst CDS liquidity spreads have fallen dramatically.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a better {{understanding}} of the performance implications for UK DC pension fund investors who choose to combine global listed and UK unlisted real estate in a blended allocation relative to a pure unlisted solution. Design/methodology/approach: Blended listed and unlisted real estate portfolios are constructed. Investor risk and returns are then studied over the full 15 year sample horizon and distinct cyclical phases over this period using a number of risk-return metrics. Performance is then contrasted with that of a pure unlisted solution, as well as UK equity market and bond total returns over the same period. Findings: A UK DC pension fund investor choosing to construct a blended global listed and UK unlisted real estate portfolio would have experienced material return enhancement relative to a pure unlisted solution. The “price” of this enhanced performance and improved <b>liquidity</b> <b>profile</b> is, unsurprisingly, higher portfolio volatility. However, because of the improved returns, the impact upon measured risk adjusted returns is less significant. Practical implications: Relatively liquid blended listed and unlisted real estate portfolios create efficient risk and return outcomes for investors.

40|$|Where an {{enterprise}} {{is able to}} anticipate its payments {{in such a manner}} as to precisely co-ordinate them with expected receipts, its treasury management is conducted in an optimal manner. In effect {{it will be possible to}} reduce costs to a minimum since the enterprise will neither need to hold near-cash assets in its treasury, with their low returns, nor retain an excessive cash balance in order to meet payments. However, the forecasts are of course, uncertain. By attaching to these treasury forecasts a probability, either relating to their timing or to their amount or both, the managers can estimate the risk of technical insolvency and from this deduce a margin of safety. This safety margin is made up of a combination of near-cash instruments and cash balances. The value of the cash balances and the level of receipts are interdependent. An enterprise that finances all of its working capital, after the deduction of operating costs, via long term capital will have less need of liquidity than one that uses short term borrowings, which are assumed to be intrinsically unstable. The choice of the means of financing working capital and the amount of near-cash assets retained are closely connected. According to classical theory the amount of long term funds used to finance working capital dictates the <b>liquidity</b> <b>profile</b> of the enterprise, its cash balances reflecting this. In this scenario, however, the greater the amount of long term funds the lower the profitability of the business, all other thing being equal. Similarly, to the extent that receipts are held in the cash balances the solvency of the enterprise is supported but the return on assets is reduced as a consequence. The objective of the manager is thus to define a compromise between liquidity and yield. Therefore, in order to enhance its safety margin {{an enterprise}} can only increase its net receipts or extend the maturity of its borrowings. These two strategies affect the profitability of the enterprise. This traditional rendition conducts the treasury manager to search for an optimal equilibrium that guarantees solvability. Financial equilibrium on the one hand, between inflows and outflows to the cash balances; monetary equilibrium on the other hand, between all the treasury's inflows and outflows, of which net receipts form the foundation. Actually, the issue in management of a treasury can be construed from a different perspective. Contrary to current opinion, an objective of maximising returns is not in conflict with that of maintaining a measure of liquidity. Optimisation consists of improving both the safety margin and the profitability, even within the context of a given treasury strategy. A treasury strategy reconciles the constraints of security and returns whilst minimising the allocation to cash assets. If an enterprise has net receipts that constantly fluctuate mildly around zero, all other things being equal, then the managers: are optimising liquidity movements, are efficiently allocating cash to profitable uses, understand exactly their financing needs, have optimised their banking relations. Without eradicating it completely, the uncertainty relating to receipts and expenditure can and must be considerably reduced and no longer justifies, in any circumstances, the retention of a “mattress” of liquidity. Awareness of the behaviour of cash flows that an enterprise is subject to, that is to say, fluctuations in the bank balances, is in the first instance, a problem of information. Every firm seeks this information. Emergency bank loans – advances and overdrafts – can be used for a relatively small amount and for a brief time to correct the forecasting errors relating to the synchronisation of the flow of funds. The rational use of such assistance requires specific attention to be paid to its adaptation to the need, taking account of the banking terms. The strategy of the treasury could in addition concern itself with the profitability of the various activities of the enterprise, which is the guarantee of long term liquidity. The activity of the enterprise raises the question of its solvability on a daily basis. Optimisation of the treasury function involves not only the coordination of the variations in the bank balances but also a surveillance of the events that generate the flow of funds: investment and its funding, the generation and application of liquidity, control of the fluctuations in the value of cash holdings. Economic literature accords a priority to the profitability criteria in financial strategy. Solvability appears only as a lower order problem that one attempts to resolve separately. Whereas in fact it is the quest to maintain the liquidity of the capital that is the primary objective and this subsumes that of profitability. This only becomes evident rarely, however, when credit is particularly expensive. Thus, all the financial concerns that derive from the operation of an enterprise are connected to importance of liquidity. The imperative of profitability is based upon the cost of holding capital. Every use implies a retention of funds, borrowed or not, for periods of different durations. However, the retention of funds involves costs: explicit costs every time the enterprise has to remunerate the providers of capital as well as opportunity costs corresponding to what the enterprise could have produced via an alternative usage. The operation of the enterprise is only justified if it extracts a sufficient amount from the employment of its resources in order to cover its costs. In other words, profitability is a prerequisite of the liquidity of the enterprise. Profitability and liquidity evolve in the same direction. Neither the retention of significant liquidity nor a collection of positive cash balances are a guarantee of security. Being solvable implies controlling every aspect of the evolution of the financial situation and involves a simultaneous maximisation of profitability and liquidity. Thus the optimal management of the treasury of an enterprise leads us to a consideration of all the financial problems faced by the firm. This comprehensive vision of the financial activity leads to a systematic approach of the treasury that consists of a dynamic response - to maintain the bank balances as close as possible to zero by optimising the funds flow, as well as a structural response – to control the replenishment of liquidity of the enterprise's capital by optimising liquidity flows. Lorsqu'une entreprise est capable de prévoir ses échéances de manière à les faire correspondre exactement à ses prévisions d'encaissements la gestion de la trésorerie est optimale. En effet, les coûts pourront être réduits au minimum puisqu'elle n'aura ni besoin de détenir des actifs liquides de faible rendement en trésorerie, ni de disposer d'un fonds de roulement pléthorique. Toutefois, les prévisions sont dans la réalité, incertaines. En associant aux prévisions de trésorerie une probabilité, soit en date, soit en montant, ou les deux, les responsables peuvent estimer le risque d'insolvabilité technique et en déduire une marge de sécurité. Cette marge de sécurité se compose d'un volant de liquidités et du fonds de roulement. La valeur du fonds de roulement et le niveau de l'encaisse sont interdépendants. Une entreprise qui finance en totalité ses actifs circulants nets des dettes d'exploitation par des capitaux à long terme aura moins besoin de liquidités que si elle les avait financés avec du crédit à court terme, supposé instable par nature. Le choix des moyens de financement des actifs circulants et la part des actifs liquides à maintenir sont étroitement liés. Selon la conception classique le volume des fonds permanents affectés au financement de l'actif circulant conditionne la liquidité de l'entreprise : le fonds de roulement est l'expression de cette liquidité. Or, plus l'immobilisation de fonds est importante et moins l'affaire est rentable, toutes choses égales par ailleurs. De même, plus l'encaisse détenue est forte plus la sécurité de l'entreprise est assurée, mais le rendement des actifs en est affaibli d'autant. L'objectif du responsable financier est donc de définir un équilibre entre liquidité et rentabilité. Ainsi, pour accroître sa marge de sécurité une entreprise ne peut qu'augmenter la proportion de son encaisse, ou allonger la durée de son endettement. Ces deux actions affectent la rentabilité de l'entreprise. Cette conception traditionnelle aboutit au niveau de la gestion de la trésorerie à rechercher un équilibre optimum gage de solvabilité. Equilibre financier, d'une part, entre les emplois et les ressources dont le fonds de roulement est le critère essentiel d'analyse. Equilibre monétaire, d'autre part, entre les flux d'entrée et de sortie de liquidités dont l'encaisse est la garantie. En fait, le problème de la gestion de la trésorerie se pose en d'autres termes. Contrairement à l'opinion courante l'objectif de rentabilité ne s'oppose pas au maintien de la liquidité. L'optimum réside dans l'amélioration conjointe de la sécurité et du profit, contenu même d'une politique de trésorerie. La politique de trésorerie concilie les contraintes de sécurité et de rentabilité en minimisant le volume de l'actif monétaire. Une entreprise dont l'encaisse fluctue en permanence légèrement autour de zéro indique, toutes choses égales par ailleurs, que les responsables : maîtrisent les flux de liquidités, réaffectent efficacement le cash-flow dans des emplois rentables, apprécient au plus juste leurs besoins de financement, négocient au mieux leurs conditions de banque. Sans disparaître totalement l'incertitude relative aux encaissements et aux décaissements peut et doit être sérieusement réduite et ne justifie plus, en tout état de cause, la détention d'un « matelas » de liquidités. La connaissance du comportement des flux monétaires qui transitent par l'entreprise, c'est-à-dire des variations du solde bancaire, est avant tout un problème d'information. La recherche de cette information est à la portée de toutes les firmes. Les crédits bancaires de « dépannage » - escompte et découverts - viennent éventuellement pour une faible part et un temps très court, corriger les erreurs de prévision relatives à la synchronisation des entrées et des sorties de fonds. L'utilisation rationnelle de ces concours nécessite une attention toute particulière de façon à les adapter aux besoins, compte tenu des conditions de banque. La politique de trésorerie doit en outre se préoccuper de la rentabilité des activités, gage de la liquidité à terme. L'activité de l'entreprise remet quotidiennement en question sa solvabilité. La maîtrise de la trésorerie passe non seulement par le contrôle des variations du solde bancaire mais aussi par la surveillance des faits générateurs des flux monétaires : l'investissement et son financement, la formation et l'affectation des flux de liquidités, le contrôle de la variation de la valeur de la monnaie. La littérature économique donne la place essentielle au critère de rentabilité dans la politique financière. La solvabilité n'apparaît que comme un « sous-problème » que l'on tente de résoudre séparément. Or, la recherche et le maintien de la liquidité du patrimoine est en réalité l'objectif prioritaire qui englobe celui de rentabilité. Cette évidence ne devient véritable contrainte que dans les périodes de rareté et de cherté de l'argent. Ainsi, toutes les préoccupations financières qui découlent elles-mêmes du fonctionnement de l'entreprise se rattachent à la nécessaire « liquidité ». L'impératif de rentabilité a pour origine le coût de détention des capitaux. Tout emploi implique une immobilisation de fonds, propres ou empruntés, pour une durée plus ou moins longue. Or toute immobilisation de fonds entraîne des coûts : coûts explicites chaque fois que l'entreprise doit assurer la rémunération des apporteurs de capitaux et coûts d'opportunité correspondants au produit que l'entreprise aurait pu tirer de l'emploi alternatif. L'activité d'entreprise ne se justifie que si elle dégage de ses emplois des ressources suffisantes pour couvrir ses coûts. Autrement dit, la rentabilité est la condition de la liquidité de l'entreprise. Rentabilité et liquidité varient dans le même sens. Ni la détention de liquidités importantes, ni un fonds de roulement positif ne sont une garantie de sécurité. Etre solvable signifie contrôler dans tous ses aspects l'évolution de la situation financière et se traduit par une maximisation simultanée de la rentabilité et de la liquidité. Ainsi la gestion optimale de la trésorerie des entreprises nous conduit à une synthèse de tous les problèmes financiers qui se posent à la firme. Cette vision globale de l'activité financière conduit à une approche système de la trésorerie qui se décline en une action conjoncturelle, dont l'objectif est de maintenir le solde bancaire le plus proche de zéro par la maîtrise des flux d'entrée et de sortie de fonds et une action structurelle, dont l'objectif est de contrôler le potentiel de reconstitution des liquidités du patrimoine de l'entreprise par la maîtrise de la formation et de l'affectation du flux de liquidité...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{large-scale}} study of commonality in liquidity and resilience across assets in an ultra high-frequency (millisecond-timestamped) Limit Order Book (LOB) dataset from a pan-European electronic equity trading facility. We first show that extant work in quantifying liquidity commonality through {{the degree of}} explanatory power of the dominant modes of variation of liquidity (extracted through Principal Component Analysis) fails to account for heavy tailed features in the data, thus producing potentially misleading results. We employ Independent Component Analysis, which both decorrelates the liquidity measures in the asset cross-section, but also reduces higher-order statistical dependencies. To measure commonality in liquidity resilience, we utilise a novel characterisation as the time required for return to a threshold liquidity level. This reflects a dimension of liquidity that is not captured {{by the majority of}} liquidity measures and has important ramifications for understanding supply and demand pressures for market makers in electronic exchanges, as well as regulators and HFTs. When the metric is mapped out across a range of thresholds, it produces the daily <b>Liquidity</b> Resilience <b>Profile</b> (LRP) for a given asset. This daily summary of liquidity resilience behaviour from the vast LOB dataset is then amenable to a functional data representation. This enables the comparison of liquidity resilience in the asset cross-section via functional linear sub-space decompositions and functional regression. The functional regression results presented here suggest that market factors for liquidity resilience (as extracted through functional principal components analysis) can explain between 10 and 40 % of the variation in liquidity resilience at low liquidity thresholds, but are less explanatory at more extreme levels, where individual asset factors take effect...|$|R
40|$|Liquidity risk is {{a crucial}} and {{inherent}} feature of the business model of banks. While banks and regulators use sophisticated mathematical methods to measure a bank's solvency risk, they use relatively simple tools for a bank's liquidity risk such as coverage ratios, sensitivity analyses, and scenario analyses. In this thesis we present a more rigorous framework {{that allows us to}} measure a bank's liquidity risk within the standard economic capital and RAROC setting. In particular, we introduce the concept of <b>liquidity</b> cost <b>profiles</b> as a quantification of a bank's illiquidity at balance sheet level, which leads subsequently to the concept of liquidity-adjusted risk measures defined on the vector space of balance sheet positions under liquidity call functions. We study the model-free effects of adding, scaling, and mixing balance sheets. In particular, we show that convexity and positive super-homogeneity of the underlying risk measures is preserved in terms of positions under the liquidity adjustment, given certain moderate conditions are met, while coherence is not, reflecting the common idea that size does matter in the face of liquidity risk. We also show that a liquidity-adjustment of the well-known Euler capital allocation principle is possible without losing the soundness property that justifies the principle. However, it is in general not possible to combine soundness with the total allocation property for both the numerator and the denominator in liquidity-adjusted RAROC. Liquidity-adjusted risk measures could be a useful addition to banking regulation and bank management as they capture essential features of a bank's liquidity risk, can be combined with existing risk management systems, possess reasonable properties under portfolio manipulations, and lead to an intuitive risk ranking of banks...|$|R
40|$|Driven by intense {{competition}} for market share, banks {{across the globe}} have allowed credit portfolios to become less diversified (across all dimensions  country, industry, sector and size) and have become willing to accept lesser quality assets on their books. As a result, even well capitalised banks could come under severe solvency pressure when global economic conditions turn. The banking industry has realised {{the need for more}} sophisticated loan origination and credit and capital management practices. To this end the reforms introduced by the Bank of International Settlement through the New Basel Accord (Basel II) aims to include exposure specific credit risk characteristics within the regulatory capital requirement framework, but is still not able to allow diversification and concentration risk to be fully recognised within the credit portfolio. In order to enhance earnings and <b>liquidity</b> <b>profiles,</b> active credit portfolio management is becoming a central part of capital management within the banking industry. If any risk mitigation or value enhancing activity is to be pursued, a credit portfolio manager must be able to identify the interdependencies between exposures in a portfolio and relate macroeconomic credit risk into tangible portfolio effects. The core principle for addressing practical questions in credit portfolio management lies in the ability to link the cyclical or systematic components of firm credit risk with the firm’s own idiosyncratic credit risk as well as the systematic credit risk component of every other exposure in the portfolio. Most structural credit portfolio management approaches have opted to represent the general economy or systematic risk by a single risk factor. The systematic component of all exposures, the process generating asset values and therefore the default thresholds are homogeneous across all firms. Indeed this Asymptotic Single Risk Factor (ASRF) model has been the foundation for Basel II. However the ASRF approach does not allow for enough flexibility when answering real life questions. Commercially available credit portfolio models have made an effort to address this issue by introducing more systematic factors in the asset-value-generating process. From a practitioner’s point of view, however, these models are often a “black-box” which allows little economic meaning or inference to be attributed to systematic factors. The methodology proposed by Pesaran, Schuermann, Treutler and Weiner (PSTW) (2006) has made a significant advance in credit risk modelling because it avoids the usage of proprietary balance sheet and distance to default data, instead focussing on credit ratings which are more freely available. Linking an adjusted structural default model to a structural global econometric (GVAR) model means that credit risk analysis and portfolio management can be done by using a conditional loss distribution estimation and simulation process. The GVAR model used in PSTW (2006) comprises a total of 25 countries and accounts for 80 per cent of world production, but does not include an African component. This thesis proposes a country-specific macroeconometric risk driver engine which is compatible with and could feed into the GVAR model and framework using vector error-correcting (VECM) techniques. This allows conditional loss estimation of a South African-specific credit portfolio and opens the door for credit portfolio modelling on a global scale because such a model can easily be linked into the GVAR model. By using firm-specific asset value functions, the outcomes from the macroeconometric vector error-correcting model (VECM) is translated into default probabilities and used to perform credit risk analysis and scenario analysis on a fictitious portfolio of corporate bank loans within the South African economy. These results can be used in credit portfolio management or standalone credit risk analysis which means that practical credit portfolio management and value enhancing applications can be performed.

40|$|Alongside {{consolidation}} and globalisation of {{the financial}} markets, the increase in values exchanged in payment and settlement systems has been remarkable. The size of intraday liquidity requested to expedite settlement of such values is accordingly very significant, especially compared to overnight or longer term liquidity. The increasing use of risk control arrangements in payment and settlement systems (e. g. real-time gross settlement) is typically associated with higher liquidity needs, which have been balanced by the parallel development of several forms of liquidity saving features in systems. The most remarkable developments have affected the qualitative management of intraday liquidity. A clear trend illustrated by continuous linked settlement (CLS) is the shortening of the time horizon in intraday liquidity management. On the “supply” side, intraday liquidity can be provided by central banks or commercial banks, depending on the settlement asset used by systems. Since most central banks extend credit only against collateral, the type of assets that participants can use {{is an important factor}} in determining the opportunity costs of intra-day liquidity. In the past decade, most central banks have substantially broadened the range of collateral they accept in their provision of liquidity. Furthermore, an interbank intraday liquidity market seems to start emerging in relation with concentration of correspondent banking activities and funding costs related to critical time windows. Developments affecting intraday liquidity management need to be adequately considered from a financial stability perspective. <b>Liquidity</b> risk <b>profile</b> has changed alongside a variety of factors including consolidation which has led to a concentration of intraday liquidity risk and the development of interdependencies in payment and settlement systems. One lesson to be drawn from the recent period is the usefulness for central banks, to have a list of eligible assets that is diversified enough to address an unexpected increase in collateral demand, in order to mitigate the consequences of a financial turmoil. Over the past decade, the relevant actors, including the banking sector, central banks and the banking supervisors have taken various initiatives to better approach the diverse challenges raised by developments in intraday liquidity. Central bank policy responses encompass the provision of new settlement services which allow to optimize intraday liquidity management of banks (e. g. the new TARGET 2 platform), the adaptation of their collateral policy to the new landscape of interdependent payment systems and oversight initiatives to better monitor and address changing risks. ...|$|R
