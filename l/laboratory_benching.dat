50|$|The {{hose barb}} is {{connected}} to a gas nozzle on the <b>laboratory</b> <b>bench</b> with rubber tubing. Most <b>laboratory</b> <b>benches</b> are equipped with multiple gas nozzles connected to a central gas source, as well as vacuum, nitrogen, and steam nozzles. The gas then flows up through the base through a small hole {{at the bottom of}} the barrel and is directed upward. There are open slots in the side of the tube bottom to admit air into the stream using the Venturi effect, and the gas burns at the top of the tube once ignited by a flame or spark. The most common methods of lighting the burner are using a match or a spark lighter.|$|R
30|$|The laboratory-calibrated load-stress {{transitive}} relation {{differs from the}} real load-stress {{transitive relation}}. This difference {{is caused by the}} difference between the constraints on the road and those on the <b>laboratory</b> <b>bench,</b> even if the <b>laboratory</b> <b>bench</b> installs the bogie, including spring, axle box, rod, anti-yaw bracket, and other related accessories, according to actual operating conditions. The most significant influencing factors are rigidity matching and gap issues. Different constraint stiffness values and contact gaps in the same direction may offset or increase the stress caused by different loads. Another cause for such a difference is the effect of the changing wheel-rail contact point on the arm of force. Therefore, from a statistical perspective, the optimized load-stress transitive relation is more reasonable than that calibrated by <b>laboratory</b> <b>bench.</b> The stress calculated by the optimized transfer coefficient still exhibits a certain degree of deviation from the measured signal. Such deviation is mainly caused by partial loads. For example, primary vertical damper loads and secondary horizontal damper loads are not measured in this test. Another reason is that elastic vibration phenomenon exists in the local structure (e.g., motor bracket). Overall, load and stress exhibit a linear relationship under the operating conditions.|$|R
40|$|The {{friction}} and wear characteristics of thin diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings {{have been investigated}} extensively in recent years mostly in <b>laboratory</b> <b>bench</b> tests. These coatings are known to provide significant friction reduction {{in the absence of}} lubricants. In the presence of lubricants, the friction benefits of these coatings are not clearly demonstrated. The current investigation is focused on exploring the friction reduction potential of a DLC coating obtained from a supplier in <b>laboratory</b> <b>bench</b> tests and in a motored valve train test. The DLC coating was deposited on the bucket tappet. In <b>laboratory</b> <b>bench</b> tests, results showed significant friction reduction {{in the absence of any}} lubricant but not in the presence of engine oil. In motored valve train tests a significant reduction in friction torque was observed when compared against a slightly rougher uncoated bucket, but no reduction was observed when compared against uncoated bucket tappet with comparable surface finish. Under boundary lubrication conditions, no lubricantderived surface films were present on the DLC-coated surface. However, under mixed lubrication conditions, evidence of patchy antiwear surface films could be observed on DLCcoated buckets. The antiwear film appears to be primarily composed of calcium phosphate...|$|R

40|$|The {{scientific}} literature {{can be used}} to construct facts or to deconstruct them. The formal journals construct by presenting maximally `demodalized' accounts of experiment. The more popular journals are licensed to present more than this, but usually, where they do provide contingent details of scientists' work, these are details of life away from the <b>laboratory</b> <b>bench.</b> Sometimes, popular journals use their license to present contingent details of work at the <b>laboratory</b> <b>bench,</b> and this has a deconstructing effect on the scientific results presented. This analysis emerges from a consideration {{of the role of the}} literature from an active `construction of scientific knowledge' perspective. The work of the `Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Claims of the Paranormal' and its journal are then analyzed with these themes in mind. The Committee sometimes presents itself as revealing the results of its own experiments, and sometimes uses its journal to deconstruct others' work. The cases of `Remote Viewing' and the astrological `Mars Effect' are discussed. The analysis bears out the `active' view as regards the {{scientific literature}}. Also, members of the Committee are seen to take up the active view as their experience of controversial science grows...|$|R
