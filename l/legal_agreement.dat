5|$|In April 2014 Liverpool F.C. {{signed a}} <b>legal</b> <b>agreement</b> with Liverpool City Council and Your Housing Group to redevelop the {{surrounding}} Anfield area. This {{was seen as}} a significant step towards the renovation of the stadium. The redevelopment was worth around £260 million. On 23 April 2014 Liverpool F.C. revealed plans for an expansion of the Main Stand, increasing its capacity by 8,250 and taking the capacity of the stadium to 54,742 In a second phase the Anfield Road stand's seating is to be increased by 4,825, which would give Anfield a total capacity of 58,000.|$|E
5|$|Waters {{attempted}} {{to subvert the}} Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice. Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured throughout North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. The parties reached a <b>legal</b> <b>agreement</b> on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained {{the right to use}} the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall.|$|E

25|$|Estimates for {{the number}} of people {{displaced}} by the military operations range from at least 100,000 to 250,000. Syrian troops deployed inside Lebanon, some of which were within visual range of the IDF, but did not take part in the fighting. The PLO retreated north of the Litani River, continuing to fire at the Israelis. The IDF used cluster bombs provided by the United States. According to U.S. President Jimmy Carter, this use of the cluster bombs violated the <b>legal</b> <b>agreement</b> between Israel and the U.S. because the weapons had been provided for defensive purposes against an attack on Israel. Israel also transferred American weapons to Saad Haddad's Lebanese militia, a violation of American law. Carter's administration prepared to notify Congress that American weapons were being used illegally, which would have resulted in military aid to Israel being cut off. The American consul in Jerusalem informed the Israeli government of their plans and, according to Carter, Prime Minister Begin said that the operation was over.|$|E
25|$|Under his presidency, the AAPR {{launched}} a heavily pro-Puerto Rican campaign, on occasion crossing political lines {{to support a}} certain cause. One of these instances was joining several multi-sectorial protests against Via Verde, an oleoduct that may damage the natural resources of Puerto Rico's karst region. Santiago also led an activity for the entity in Comerío, where he was joined by other prominent figures such as Luis Gutiérrez, to support {{the release of the}} last Puerto Rican political prisoner, Oscar López. The AAPR also engaged in regular practices. Santiago personally opposed the revocation of a <b>legal</b> <b>agreement</b> reached between all of the municipalities and the Autoridad de Energia Electrica (AEE), which would endanger the availability of the electrical grid to smaller towns. The entity also reclaimed a direct line to guarantee education funds. In his role as spokesman, Santiago was also responsible for denouncing disparity in the assignment of funds between PPD and PNP municipalities. The AAPR decided to boycott official activities under the PNP administration to express their contempt at these actions. Santiago has also directly opposed his antithesis of the PNP's Federación de Alcaldes de Puerto Rico (FAPR), Héctor O'Neill, most notably when a large scale fraud took place in Guaynabo's District 6 primary, which was schemed from within the municipality's government structure.|$|E

Throughout pre-production Fincher negotiated a <b>legal</b> <b>agreement</b> with Carlton, whereby a financial recovery was made for anything they used that was taxpayer-funded.

This led to serious congestion at Finsbury Park as passengers from the expanding suburbs changed from buses and trams to the GN and GNP, and in June 1923 a petition of 30,000 signatures calling for the extension {{of one of the}} underground lines northwards was delivered to the Ministry of Transport.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary {{accounts}} described Henry VI as {{peaceful and}} pious, not {{suited for the}} violent dynastic civil wars, such as the War of the Roses. [...] He had periods of insanity while his inherent benevolence eventually required his wife, Margaret of Anjou, to assume control of his kingdom, which contributed to his own downfall. [...] His ineffectual rule had encouraged the nobles' schemes to establish control over him, and the situation deteriorated into a civil war between the supporters of his house and those of Richard, Duke of York. After the Yorkists captured Henry in 1460, the English parliament passed an Act of Accord to let York and his line succeed Henry as king. Henry's consort, Margaret of Anjou, {{refused to accept the}} dispossession of her son's right to the throne and, along with fellow Lancastrian malcontents, raised an army. Richard of York was killed at the Battle of Wakefield and his titles, including the claim to the throne, passed to his eldest son Edward. Nobles who were previously hesitant to support Richard's claim to the throne considered the Lancastrians to have reneged on the Act — a <b>legal</b> <b>agreement</b> — and Edward found enough backing to denounce Henry and declare himself king. The Battle of Towton was to affirm the victor's right to rule over England through force of arms.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the serious}} issues same-gendered couples living {{in states that}} do not legally {{recognize}} their relationships face, {{this article examines the}} very real need for same-sex couples to use private law, in the form of specific legal documents, to protect their rights.

Clergy, by facilitating the assistance of legal counsel and integrating the execution of <b>legal</b> <b>agreements,</b> will help provide same-sex couples with a level of legal, emotional and financial well-being that may not currently be attainable without private <b>legal</b> <b>agreements.</b> The article begins by examining {{the current state of the}} laws governing same-sex relationships at both the federal and state level.

The paper will then examine four areas of the law where uncertainty for same sex couples lies and the <b>legal</b> <b>agreements</b> that can be effectively utilized to reduce this uncertainty. These areas include: 1) medical/end of life decisions; 2) financial welfare of both parties and distribution of assets upon dissolution of the relationship; 3...|$|R
