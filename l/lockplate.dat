25|$|The upper {{segment of}} the grooved wheel, made of {{hardened}} steel, projects through a slot cut to its precise dimensions {{in the base of}} the priming pan. The wheel is grooved on its outside circumference with three or more V-shaped grooves with transverse cuts at intervals to provide a friction surface for the iron pyrites. The wheel is fixed to a shaft, one end of which projects outside the <b>lockplate.</b> The outside projection is of square section to permit a spanner (wrench) to be engaged for subsequent tensioning of the lock. The other end of the shaft fits {{through a hole in the}} <b>lockplate,</b> and on this end is forged a cam, or eccentric. One end of a short, robust chain (made of three or four flat, parallel links like a short piece of bicycle chain) is fixed to the cam, while the other end of the chain is held in a groove at the end of the longer branch of a large heavy V-spring, which is generally retained by a screw and a headed bracket through upstands inside the <b>lockplate.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{action of}} the Krag–Petersson is, {{as seen in the}} {{photograph}} to the left, simple compared to modern rifles. It consists of eight components: the receiver (A), the hammer (B), the tilting breechblock (C), the firing pin (D), two pins to secure the hammer and breechblock (E and F), a <b>lockplate</b> with a screw to secure the pins (G) and the tubular magazine (not shown in the photograph).|$|E
2500|$|The trigger engages one {{arm of a}} [...] "z"-shaped sear {{pivoting}} in its centre {{between two}} upstanding brackets riveted or brazed {{to the inside of}} the <b>lockplate.</b> The other arm of the sear passes through a hole in the <b>lockplate,</b> and engages in a blind hole on the inner side of the wheel, thus effectively locking it and preventing any rotation but only because of a secondary sear or wedge that is pressed under the rear arm of the sear—that is between the <b>lockplate</b> and the sear—when the forward part of it engages into the recess in the wheel. When the trigger is pulled, the secondary lever is withdrawn from its position and the strong pull of the mainspring pushes the unsupported [...] main sear back into the lock and the wheel is free to rotate. The mechanism may seem overconstructed, but it prevents the trigger mechanism from working against the very powerful mainspring as it is the case with all vertical acting sears in flint and percussion locks or even modern firearms that still have cocks (revolvers).|$|E
50|$|Applies various {{chemical}} processes (browning, bluing, Parkerization, among others) {{to the metal}} parts of guns to develop corrosion resistant surface layers on the steel. They may also apply case hardening to low carbon steel parts. Case hardening is a combined chemical and heat-treatment process which introduces carbon into the surfaces of low steel alloys that does not contain sufficient carbon to allow total ("through") heat treatment. This carbon rich surface is then heat treated resulting in a thin, very hard surface layer with a tough, malleable core. This process can be done solely for the mechanical properties (hardness and toughness) it imparts, or, by packing the parts in bone charcoal and other chemicals and heating in a heat treatment furnace for varying time periods, {{it is possible to}} introduce rich colors into the carbonized surface. This type of case hardening, known as color case hardening, is prized for its rich mottled blues, purples, browns and grey tones. It is possible, with highly skilled craftsmen using highly proprietary processes, to control the hues and patterns so closely that one familiar with high grade custom firearms can usually recognize the maker of another shooter's firearm solely by the colors and patterns on its parts; an important distinction on extremely costly firearms of the highest grade. Typically, its use is usually restricted to receivers, rarely barrels. Although providing corrosion resistance, the colored surface layers are subject to wear and may also fade with time. Antique firearms for sale frequently note the specific percentage of the factory original case coloring remaining on the receiver and <b>lockplates.</b> Renewing this color case hardening to the specific patterns of the firearm when it was new has become an important sub-area of the gunsmithing field.|$|R

5000|$|The Kabyle musket or moukalla (moukhala) [...] was {{a type of}} musket {{widely used}} in North Africa, {{produced}} by many native tribes and nations. Two systems of gunlock prevailed in Kabyle guns, one, which derived from Dutch and English types of snaphance lock, usually with a thicker <b>lockplate.</b> Half cock was provided by a dog catch behind the cock. At full cock, the sear passing through the <b>lockplate</b> engaged the heel of the cock. The other mechanism was the so-called Arab toe-lock, a form of miquelet lock, closely allied to the agujeta lock (which required a back or dog catch for half cock) and the Italian romanlock. The term miquelet is used today to describe {{a particular type of}} snaplock. The miquelet lock, in all varieties, was common for several centuries in the countries surrounding the Mediterranean, particularly in Spain, Italy, the Balkans, and Ottoman domains including the coastal states of North Africa. The type of musket would be described as a Kabyle snaphance or a Kabyle miquelet. (Blair: 1982 pages 281,289) ...|$|E
50|$|Queen Anne pistols are {{a type of}} flintlock pistol {{distinguished}} by the <b>lockplate</b> being forged in one piece with the breech and the trigger plate. They are usually a breech-loading design known as a turn-off pistol. Possibly first made in England, they came in fashion in England {{during the reign of}} Anne, Queen of Great Britain, hence the name. Though made in all sizes up to carbine, they were usually made in the size range known as coat pocket pistols or coat pistols, easy to conceal on one's person. A small version, known as a Toby or muff pistol, was able to be concealed in a smaller pocket or a ladies' hand warmer muff.|$|E
5000|$|The Kerr Revolver {{featured}} a side-mounted hammer on a back-action <b>lockplate.</b> Unlike other revolvers of the day, the lock {{mechanism of the}} Kerr revolver was identical to that of back-action rifle and single shot pistol percussion locks of the time. The simple action {{was designed to be}} easily repairable in the field without requiring model-specific spare parts. The Kerr had a top strap over the cylinder, which is held in place by a pin that runs {{into the back of the}} frame below the hammer. The pistol is 12.25 inches overall with a barrel length of about 5 inches. Nearly all were made in [...]44, or [...] "54 bore", caliber; a few in the smaller [...]36 caliber.|$|E
5000|$|The {{key element}} {{apparently}} added by Marin le Bourgeoys was the vertically acting sear. The sear is a [...] "catch" [...] or [...] "latch" [...] which holds the mechanism {{in a position}} ready to fire; the trigger acts upon, or is part of, the sear, releasing it and allowing a strong spring {{to act on the}} mechanism to fire the gun. Previously the sear, located within the lock, had acted {{through a hole in the}} <b>lockplate</b> to engage the cock on the outside of the plate. The vertically acting sear acted on a piece called the tumbler, on the inside of the lock which was mounted on the same rotating shaft as the cock. This design proved to be the most efficient in terms of cost and reliability.|$|E
5000|$|Wild Bill Hickok, {{the famous}} gunfighter, used {{a variant of}} the Springfield model 1870. The [...] "Hickok rifle" [...] has a 29 5/8 inch barrel, which is longer than the carbine version's barrel and shorter than the rifle version's barrel, and also has a Kentucky rifle style sloped butt. The {{trapdoor}} mechanism is stamped with the year 1870, and the <b>lockplate</b> is stamped with the year 1863, indicating that this rifle was originally produced as a Model 1863 musket and was later converted as part of the model 1870 manufacturing. The name [...] "J. B. Hickok" [...] was carved into the stock using a sharp knife. Hickok was buried with this rifle in 1876. However, when he was reburied in Mount Moriah in 1879, someone removed the rifle from his coffin.|$|E
50|$|A {{grand total}} of 58,450 Remington M1867 were {{delivered}} to the Norwegian Armed Forces from 1867 until 1883, when production was curtailed {{to make room for}} the Jarmann M1884. All production rifles were meant to be manufactured at Kongsberg Våpenfabrik in Norway, but since the factory needed to be upgraded with more modern machinery, 5000 of the first rifles delivered to the Norwegian Army were manufactured by Husqvarna Vapenfabrik in Sweden in 1871-72. The difference is minor; the Norwegian rifles have brass buttplates and head of the cleaning rod, and steel mounting bands, while Swedish rifles have iron furniture. For the first few years the barrels of the M1867 were made of iron, but after 1871, steel became the standardized material. The price for each barrel was slightly higher, but the better design reduced misfire damage and ultimately resulted in cost effectiveness. Additionally, the designers improved the lock by replacing two lockscrews with a <b>lockplate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1777, several {{thousand}} stands of French arms arrived at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and were transported to Fort Ticonderoga/Mount Independence on Lake Champlain where the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments were encamped. These Yankee soldiers must have eagerly exchanged their old hunting fowlers and Committee of Safety muskets which they had used {{for the first two}} years of the conflict for these state of the art French weapons, which today are the only surviving regimentally marked American arms from the Revolutionary War. These handsome guns became popularly known as [...] "Charleville" [...] muskets, for one of the armories where they were made in France; [...] "Charleville" [...] was often inscribed on the <b>lockplate.</b> Once the guns were in American hands in 1777, the barrel of each musket was also stamped with letters [...] "NH" [...] as well as the battalion, and individually numbered. These weapons served the New Hampshire troops well for the remainder of the war. One French Model 1768 musket issued to a man in the 2nd NH is now preserved at the NRA Museum.|$|E
5000|$|The Model 1795 {{retained}} many of {{the characteristics}} of the Charleville on which it was based. It had a 44 inch long [...]69 caliber barrel, a 56 inch stock, and a total length of 60 inches. The original version had the bayonet lug {{on the bottom of the}} barrel but this was later moved to the top. Minor changes were made throughout production inclusive of a shorter barrel length of 42" [...] on the later Harper's Ferry weapons. Barrels of Harper's Ferry 1795s were serial numbered up to some point in 1812: Springfield M1795's were never serial numbered. Springfield began the Model 1812 improvements in 1814, but Harper's Ferry would continue on with the production of the M1795 until at least 1819 (early 1819 examples still used the M1795 <b>lockplate)</b> and never produced the M1812. Eventually, both armories would incorporate improvements into the M1816 flintlock which were after a few years virtually identical. Most, but not all, parts will interchange on the M1816 muskets but the hand-crafted parts, and lack of set standards and patterns on the earlier M1795 weapons often means parts will not interchange easily.|$|E
