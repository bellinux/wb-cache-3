5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses <b>lensing</b> {{effects as}} an important tool to infer properties of the <b>lensing</b> object. Even in cases where that object is not directly visible, {{the shape of a}} lensed image provides information about the mass distribution responsible for the light deflection. In particular, gravitational <b>lensing</b> provides one way to measure the distribution of dark matter, which does not give off light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the <b>lensing</b> masses are spread out over a significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be used to obtain information about the large-scale properties and evolution of our cosmos.|$|E
5|$|With Peter Schneider, Ehlers {{embarked}} on an in-depth study of the foundations of gravitational <b>lensing.</b> One result of this work was a 1992 monograph co-authored with Schneider and Emilio Falco. It was the first systematic exposition of the topic that included both the theoretical foundations and the observational results. From the viewpoint of astronomy, gravitational <b>lensing</b> is often described using a quasi-Newtonian approximation—assuming the gravitational field to be small and the deflection angles to be minute—which is perfectly sufficient for most situations of astrophysical relevance. In contrast, the monograph developed a thorough and complete description of gravitational <b>lensing</b> from a fully relativistic space-time perspective. This feature of the book played a major part in its long-term positive reception. In the following years, Ehlers continued his research on the propagation of bundles of light in arbitrary spacetimes.|$|E
5|$|Experiments and {{observations}} show that Einstein's description of gravitation accounts for several effects that are unexplained by Newton's law, such as minute anomalies in {{the orbits of}} Mercury and other planets. General relativity also predicts novel effects of gravity, such as gravitational waves, gravitational <b>lensing</b> and an effect of gravity on time known as gravitational time dilation. Many of these predictions have been confirmed by experiment or observation, most recently gravitational waves.|$|E

5|$|Since photons {{contribute}} to the stress–energy tensor, they exert a gravitational attraction on other objects, according {{to the theory of}} general relativity. Conversely, photons are themselves affected by gravity; their normally straight trajectories may be bent by warped spacetime, as in gravitational <b>lensing,</b> and their frequencies may be lowered by moving to a higher gravitational potential, as in the Pound–Rebka experiment. However, these effects are not specific to photons; exactly the same effects would be predicted for classical electromagnetic waves.|$|E
5|$|The {{deflection}} {{of light}} by gravity {{is responsible for}} {{a new class of}} astronomical phenomena. If a massive object is situated between the astronomer and a distant target object with appropriate mass and relative distances, the astronomer will see multiple distorted images of the target. Such effects are known as gravitational <b>lensing.</b> Depending on the configuration, scale, and mass distribution, there can be two or more images, a bright ring known as an Einstein ring, or partial rings called arcs.|$|E

Current and upcoming imaging surveys will contain {{thousands of new}} <b>lensed</b> quasars, augmenting the existing sample by at least two orders of magnitude. To find such lens systems, we built a robot, CHITAH, that hunts for <b>lensed</b> quasars by modeling {{the configuration of the}} multiple quasar images. Specifically, given an image of an object that might be a <b>lensed</b> quasar, CHITAH first disentangles the light from the supposed lens galaxy and the light from the multiple quasar images based on color information. A simple rule is designed to categorize the given object as a potential four-image (quad) or two-image (double) <b>lensed</b> quasar system. The configuration of the identified quasar images is subsequently modeled to classify whether the object is a <b>lensed</b> quasar system.

For {{the largest and}} brightest four of these—Abell 1689, 2261, 2142 and 2390—comparisons were made with X-ray and Subaru weak <b>lensing</b> data to study the cluster layout and radial properties, specifically of the mass profiles and baryon content.

50|$|The {{foreground}} galaxy lies {{directly in}} front in our line of sight to a more distant galaxy.

5|$|APM 08279+5255 {{is a very}} distant, broad {{absorption}} line quasar discovered in 1998 and initially considered the most luminous object yet found. It is magnified and split into multiple images by the gravitational <b>lensing</b> effect of a foreground galaxy through which its light passes.

The galaxy possesses large regions of hot dust and molecular gas, as well as regions with starburst activity. It has a cosmological redshift of 3.911. While observing the quasar in 2008, astronomers using ESA's XMM Newton and the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) in Arizona discovered the huge galaxy cluster 2XMM J083026+524133.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} {{gravitational}} <b>lensing</b> {{is found in}} the radio galaxy 3C 324. First thought to be a single overluminous radio galaxy with a redshift of z=1.206, it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies, with the radio galaxy at the aforementioned redshift being lensed by another galaxy at redshift z=0.845. The first example of a multiply-imaged radio galaxy discovered, the source appears to be an elliptical galaxy with a dust lane obscuring our view of the visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus. In even shorter wavelengths, the BL Lac object PG 1553+113 is a heavy emitter of gamma rays. This object is the most distant found to emit photons with energies in the TeV range as of 2007. The spectrum is unique, with hard emission in some ranges of the gamma-ray spectrum in stark contrast to soft emission in others.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{calculate}} {{the age of}} the Universe by assuming that the Lambda-CDM model accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model. This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck. Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational <b>lensing</b> and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present. With the prior that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of {{the age of the}} Universe as of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s and the 1980s, various {{observations}} {{showed that}} there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational <b>lensing</b> studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{theory has}} {{important}} astrophysical implications. For example, it implies {{the existence of}} black holes—regions of space in which space and time are distorted {{in such a way}} that nothing, not even light, can escape—as an end-state for massive stars. There is ample evidence that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes; for example, microquasars and active galactic nuclei result from the presence of stellar black holes and supermassive black holes, respectively. The bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational <b>lensing,</b> in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky. General relativity also predicts the existence of gravitational waves, which have since been observed directly by physics collaboration LIGO. In addition, general relativity is the basis of current cosmological models of a consistently expanding universe.|$|E

5|$|Some {{predictions}} {{of general relativity}} differ significantly from those of classical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light.

The {{predictions of}} general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity {{is not the only}} relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data.

25|$|Historically, <b>lensing</b> {{analyses}} were conducted on galaxy clusters detected via their baryon content (e.g. from optical or X-ray surveys). The sample of galaxy clusters studied with <b>lensing</b> was thus subject to various selection effects; for example, only the most luminous clusters were investigated. In 2006, David Wittman of the University of California at Davis and collaborators published the first sample of galaxy clusters detected via their <b>lensing</b> signals, completely independent of their baryon content. Clusters discovered through <b>lensing</b> are subject to mass selection effects because the more massive clusters produce <b>lensing</b> signals with higher signal-to-noise.|$|E

Selective {{amplification}} of {{the line}} and continuum source by microlensing in a <b>lensed</b> quasar can lead to changes of continuum spectral slopes and line shapes in the spectra of the quasar components. Comparing the spectra of different components of the <b>lensed</b> quasar and the spectra of an image observed in different epochs one can infer the presence of millilensing, microlensing and intrinsic variability. Especially, microlensing can be used for investigation of the unresolved broad line (BLR) and continuum emitting region structure in active galactic nuclei (AGN).

All galaxies have deep rest-frame optical integral-field spectroscopy obtained with the VLT. The unlensed galaxies appear to have a larger ratio of random to bulk motion. Field galaxies also have broader lines than strongly <b>lensed</b> LBGs with rest-optical spectroscopy, where spectra were extracted from regions with similar physical size. To ensure observational success, studies of high-redshift galaxy kinematics often focus on bright and luminous targets, and our comparison suggests that this may lead to a serious bias.

40|$|Foreground {{galaxies that}} amplify {{the light from}} {{background}} quasars may also dim that light if the galaxies contain enough dust. Extinction by dust in lenses could hide {{the large number of}} <b>lensed</b> systems predicted for a flat universe with a large value of the cosmological constant Λ. We look for one signature of dust, namely reddening, by examining optical-infrared colors of gravitationally <b>lensed</b> images of quasars. We find that the <b>lensed</b> systems identified in radio and infrared searches have redder optical-IR colors than optically selected ones. This could be due to a bias against selecting reddened (hence extincted) quasars in the optical surveys, or due to the differences in the intrinsic colors of optical and radio quasars. Comparison of the radio-selected <b>lensed</b> and unlensed quasars shows that the <b>lensed</b> ones have redder colors. We therefore conclude that {{at least part of the}} color difference between the two lens samples is due to dust. From the color difference between <b>lensed</b> and unlensed radio quasars (and assuming Galactic extinction law) we can reconcile a large cosmological constant (Λ = 0. 9) with the number of <b>lensed</b> systems observed in flux limited optical surveys. These results substantially weaken the strongest constraint on cosmological scenarios that invoke a non-zero cosmological constant to explain age discrepancy problems, satisfy predictions of inflationary models of the early universe and play a role in large scale structure formation models. They also raise the prospect of using gravitational lenses to study the interstellar medium in high redshift galaxies...|$|R
