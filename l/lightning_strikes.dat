5|$|Every year, Florida averages 10 {{deaths and}} 30 {{injuries}} from <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes,</b> {{with several of}} these usually occurring in or around Tampa. University of Florida lightning expert Martin A. Uman has calculated that the average resident is within a half-mile of 10 to 15 <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes</b> every year. TECO Energy, the local electric utility, spends over USD $1,000,000 annually to repair transformers and other equipment damaged by <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Harp and Mayer {{conducted}} an experiment using a lesson about <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes.</b> The effect of <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes</b> on airplanes was added as a seductive detail. In {{six out of}} six experiments, learners who studied the base lesson without the seductive details about the strikes on airplanes demonstrated they were {{three times more likely}} to recall the structurally important details. They also performed much better on a problem-solving task than learners whose lessons included the seductive details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when learners are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} produced rough surf, moderate wind gusts, and locally {{heavy rainfall}} during its passage over Hawaii. No damages or deaths were reported. Two {{people were injured}} in the island of Hawaii due to <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes</b> from the storm.|$|E

The {{ratio of the}} spectral energies in each of two frequency bands is used to distinguish between a normal fault and a <b>lightning</b> <b>strike.</b> A higher ratio indicates a fault, a lower ratio a <b>lightning</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Lightning</b> <b>strike</b> {{victims are}} rarely {{presented}} at an emergency department. Burns {{are often the}} primary focus. This case report describes the improvised explosive device like-injury to the thorax due to <b>lightning</b> <b>strike</b> and its treatment, {{which has not been}} described prior in (kerauno) medicine. Penetrating injury due to blast from <b>lightning</b> <b>strike</b> is extremely rare. These shrapnel injuries should however be ruled out in all patients struck by lightning...|$|R
50|$|The {{effects of}} typical {{lightning}} on traditional metal-covered aircraft are well understood and serious damage from a <b>lightning</b> <b>strike</b> {{on an airplane}} is rare. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner of which the exterior is carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer received no damage from a <b>lightning</b> <b>strike</b> during testing.|$|R
5|$|As {{the storm}} arrives, Marty {{returns to the}} clock tower and the <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes</b> on cue, sending Marty back to October 1985. He finds that Doc is not dead, as he had listened to Marty's {{warnings}} and worn a bullet-proof vest. Doc takes Marty home, then departs to 2015.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 2015, Donecle, a Toulouse {{start-up}} company, {{has also}} launched a drone approach which was initially specialized in {{the detection of}} <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes</b> on aeroplanes. Performed by five people equipped with harnesses and platforms, this inspection usually takes about eight hours. The immobilization of the aircraft and the staff are costly for the airlines, estimated at $10 000 per hour. The solution proposed by the start-up lasts twenty minutes.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{was also}} reported in Sinaloa on the Mexican mainland. The remnants of Ignacio produced thunderstorm activity in high terrain areas of central interior California. Over 300 <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes</b> from the remnant moisture {{was recorded in}} a one-hour period. The lightning caused 14 forest fires in Merced County, resulting {{in a loss of}} power to over 3,500 customers in and around the Atwater area.|$|E
40|$|A 48 year-old-female {{was struck}} dead by {{lightning}} on the 24 th October 2010 in Pretoria South Africa. The {{cause of death}} was due to direct <b>lightning</b> <b>strike.</b> Examination showed secondary missile injury on her legs. This secondary missile (shrapnel) injury was caused by the <b>lightning</b> <b>striking</b> the concrete pavement next to her. Small pieces of concrete were located embedded within the shrapnel wounds. This case report represents the first documented case of secondary missile formation (shrapnel injury) due to <b>lightning</b> <b>strike</b> in the literature. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>lightning</b> <b>strike</b> to {{transmission}} and distribution systems are numerous and unfavorable. Just imagine the cost and havoc if a giant telecommunications company is shut down {{for an hour or}} day as a result of devices damage or a petrochemical plant catches fires due to <b>lightning</b> <b>strike.</b> Hence the needs to protect power apparatus from overvoltage surge are imperative. In this study an adaptive risk analysis & management (ARAM) based on artificial neural networks is proposed to analyze and proactively control the overvoltage at power substation due to <b>lightning</b> <b>strike...</b>|$|R
5|$|Alarmed by the FBI's presence, Zero visits Oswald at {{his home}} that night; a drunk and rowdy Oswald dismisses Zero's worries and summons {{lightning}} to strike down nearby cattle. The <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes</b> him instead, but he appears unharmed. The next day, the agents visit the scene and find a melted shoe print in the ground, linking it to Oswald. Meanwhile, Oswald uses his abilities to manipulate local traffic lights, causing a car accident. The agents visit Oswald's home and find a cut-out picture of Sharon Kiveat, Oswald's former high school teacher, inside a porn magazine.|$|E
5|$|Electroporation is {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in bilayer permeability induced by {{the application of a}} large artificial electric field across the membrane. Experimentally, electroporation is used to introduce hydrophilic molecules into cells. It is a particularly useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as DNA, which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core. Because of this, electroporation {{is one of the key}} methods of transfection as well as bacterial transformation. It has even been proposed that electroporation resulting from <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes</b> could be a mechanism of natural horizontal gene transfer.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes,</b> and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with {{the other end of}} the rod placed deep into the ground. The sharp point of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the iron rod instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E

5|$|Most {{end users}} of {{forecasts}} {{are members of}} the general public. Thunderstorms can create strong winds and dangerous <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes</b> that can lead to deaths, power outages, and widespread hail damage. Heavy snow or rain can bring transportation and commerce to a stand-still, as well as cause flooding in low-lying areas. Excessive heat or cold waves can sicken or kill those with inadequate utilities, and droughts can impact water usage and destroy vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Mount Thielsen, or Big Cowhorn (Klamath: hisc’akwaleeʔas), is an extinct {{shield volcano}} in the Oregon High Cascades, near Mount Bailey. Because eruptive {{activity}} ceased 250,000years ago, glaciers have heavily eroded the volcano's structure, creating precipitous slopes and a horn-like peak. The spire-like shape of Thielsen attracts <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes</b> and creates fulgurite, an unusual mineral. The prominent horn forms a centerpiece for the Mount Thielsen Wilderness, a reserve for recreational {{activities such as}} skiing and hiking.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{initially}} moved little, Bret brought prolonged overcast {{conditions to}} much of the northern Bahamas, with most of the activity over the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama. An estimated 3 in (75mm) of precipitation fell in Abaco over the weekend of July 1617. In addition, a weather station on the island reported gale-force gusting of up to 48mph (77km/h) {{at the height of the}} storm. The rain led to the cancellation of a local Little League baseball match. Outer rainbands spawned a waterspout that touched down on eastern Paradise Island, accompanied by <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes</b> and torrents. Nevertheless, locals considered the storm's impact to be generally positive, as its rains aided in alleviating mild drought conditions across the nation.|$|E

5|$|After {{a pair of}} Tiger {{possessions}} {{that ended}} with punts and an Alabama possession that ended with a lost fumble by McCarron, the Crimson Tide started their fourth scoring drive of the afternoon. The drive began with a 22-yard McCarron pass to Christion Jones and finished with a 15-yard Yeldon touchdown run. Immediately after Yeldon scored, the referees stopped the game temporarily and cleared the field due to <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes</b> {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the stadium. After a 40-minute stoppage, the game resumed with a Jeremy Shelley extra point and a Crimson Tide lead of 28–0. Missouri responded on the kickoff that ensued with their only touchdown of the afternoon on a 98-yard Marcus Murphy return that made the halftime score 28–7.|$|E
5|$|Disturbance is {{important}} in the creation of biodiverse habitats. In the absence of disturbance, a climax vegetation cover develops that prevents the establishment of other species. Wildflower meadows are sometimes created by conservationists but most of the flowering plants used are either annuals or biennials and disappear after a few years in the absence of patches of bare ground on which their seedlings can grow. <b>Lightning</b> <b>strikes</b> and toppled trees in tropical forests allow species richness to be maintained as pioneering species move in to fill the gaps created. Similarly coastal habitats can become dominated by kelp until the seabed is disturbed by a storm and the algae swept away, or shifting sediment exposes new areas for colonisation. Another cause of disturbance is when an area may be overwhelmed by an invasive introduced species which is not kept under control by natural enemies in its new habitat.|$|E
5|$|Keith dropped around 3inches (75mm) of {{rainfall}} {{along the northern}} coast of Honduras, and totals of around 10inches (250mm) were reported on offshore islands. As the storm was making landfall on Mexico, a ship just west of Cozumel reported wind gusts of 90mph (149km/h), while a second ship in Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, recorded sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h). Reports from Cozumel indicated torrential rainfall {{and a large number}} of <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes</b> during the period of highest winds. Rainfall peaked at 7.69inches (195mm) just south of Cancún. Still recovering from the effects of Hurricane Gilbert two months prior, the Yucatán Peninsula received only minor damage as a result of Keith. The storm triggered flooding in western Cuba that severely damaged tobacco and vegetable crops. Officials forced 2,500residents to evacuate their homes due to the flooding. The storm also dropped nearly 4inches (100mm) of precipitation in Kingston, Jamaica.|$|E

40|$|The study {{concentrates}} on structural {{damage caused by}} the thermal effects of <b>lightning</b> <b>strike</b> to carbon fibre composites (CFC). The main objectives are to construct {{a model of the}} major physical effects involved, and to understand the correlation between the damage mechanisms and the damage witnessed in modern CFC. Model verification will be done by experimental decoupling of damage mechanisms, e. g. the real Joule heating from a <b>lightning</b> <b>strike</b> is replaced by a high power laser beam acting on composite surface. Outcomes from this study can then be used for further investigations and optimisation of <b>lightning</b> <b>strike</b> protection methods...|$|R

5|$|They are {{alerted to}} {{eyewitness}} accounts {{of a woman}} who, after jumping with another man from a high roof and crashing onto a taxi parked below, simply walked away. As the Fringe team investigates, they are approached by another FBI agent, Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), who identifies the woman as Dana Gray (Paula Malcomson). Dana, who had been struck by lightning twice, was killed eighteen months earlier along with her family during a robbery of their home, but she apparently was able {{to walk away from}} the morgue. Since then, she has appeared to commit suicide with several others, but always managing to walk away. Walter (John Noble) and Bell, in studying Dana's blood samples, find that her body may have been altered by several past <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes,</b> making her incapable of dying.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the known}} {{residents}} of Quahog are invited to a dinner party in his palatial mansion by James Woods, who states {{he has become a}} born-again Christian thanks to his new girlfriend Priscilla, and wishes to repent for all his wrongdoings. Early into the night, as Woods and Priscilla go to the kitchen, Quagmire's new companion, Stephanie, is mysteriously shot when she sits in Woods's seat, leading the guests to believe Woods intends to murder them all. They try to leave, but <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes</b> a tree, causing it to break the bridge. Meanwhile, the main road is flooded due to the storm. Returning amidst accusations, Woods pleads ignorance before he too is murdered in front of the guests by an unseen killer with a knife during a power outage, causing Priscilla to faint. Trapped on the remote estate with no way of contacting anyone due to a thunderstorm, the guests realize that the killer is among them. They also discover that Stephanie's body has disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Remarkably, though {{hundreds}} {{of homes and}} other structures were leveled, no one was killed by tornadoes that day. Tornado damage caused about 140 injuries, mostly minor, and one death and 11 injuries were caused by wind damage. In just five hours, the storms produced more than 12,500 <b>lightning</b> <b>strikes.</b> The airport in Oxford, Connecticut recorded 4.4inches (112mm) of rain in just 30 minutes. While the northeastern United States experiences occasional tornadoes, an event of this scale is especially rare. Typical tornadoes {{in this area are}} short-lived and not particularly damaging. This outbreak featured several long-lived tornadoes, produced by storms which also produced destructive non-tornadic winds over a large area. Since 1950, only six violent tornadoes have occurred in the Northeastern US, two of which were part of this outbreak. It was by far the worst tornado event in the area since May 2, 1983, when six significant tornadoes tore through New York, and maybe the worst since the Worcester Tornado.|$|E
