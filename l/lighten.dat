5|$|In early October the two {{companies}} reached Fort Laramie, Wyoming, where they expected to be restocked with provisions, but no provisions were there for them. The companies had to cut back food rations, hoping that their supplies would last until help could be sent from Utah. To <b>lighten</b> their loads, the Martin Company cut the luggage allowance to 10 pounds (4.5 kg) per person, discarding clothing and blankets that soon would be desperately needed.|$|E
40|$|Through the law no. 28 / 2009, the {{regional}} governments {{are allowed to}} collect {{the regional}} taxes. The tax collection in a region can be adjusted with the potential and the regional policy which is established together with the regional regulation. The target of the income in street <b>lightening</b> taxes that always established every year is always raised by Semarang City government. However, if we see from the achievement, it is always exceed from the target. It indicates that {{the realization of the}} income from the street <b>lightening</b> taxes in Semarang is not suitable with the potential. The aims of this research are to present the potential of street <b>lightening</b> taxes income and the effectiveness of street <b>lightening</b> taxes in Semarang from 2003 until 2009. Beside that, the writer did the identification on the factors that affect the street <b>lightening</b> taxes in Semarang. This research uses the secondary data from 2001 until 2009 period. The method of analysis data used in this research is the descriptive quantitative method with the regression analysis in interpolation data. This research results in finding the number of customers, connected power, and the using of electricity that affect in the income of street <b>lightening</b> taxes significantly and on the whole, the independent variables can explain the income of street <b>lightening</b> taxes in Semarang. The result in counting the potential of street <b>lightening</b> taxes in Semarang showed that the potential in street <b>lightening</b> taxes income in Semarang is still high. The industry groups have the biggest potential in street <b>lightening</b> taxes income. The effectiveness in street <b>lightening</b> taxes shows that the collection and the management of street <b>lightening</b> taxes in Semarang are not effective yet...|$|R

Betelgeuse was then instructed to sail for Whiddy Island, Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish Navy hired two salvage {{companies}} to refloat the battleship, but both declined after they surveyed the wreck. Unable to raise her, the Spanish decided to remove as much weight {{as possible from}} España {{in an attempt to}} <b>lighten</b> her to permit refloating. Her guns were removed and dropped overboard to be picked up later by the salvage vessel Kanguro. The battleship's armor, machinery, and ammunition stores were also removed to <b>lighten</b> her. Her hull was then sealed and partially drained in preparation for raising, but while waiting for the necessary equipment from Italy, several violent storms hit the ship and caused further damage. The battered hull could now no longer be raised, and in November 1924, she broke in half and was abandoned by the Spanish Navy. The 305mm and 102mm guns recovered from España were installed in coastal batteries, some of which remained in service until 1999 before they were retired from service. After the overthrow of King Alfonso XIII, his namesake ship Alfonso XIII, was renamed España in April 1931.|$|E

After he had created significantly more material than would fit on a standard LP, an earthquake struck LA. He decided to head back to New York for some live sessions, with the help of Moogy Klingman, to <b>lighten</b> the mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and this created enough material for a double album.|$|E
5|$|The {{dogs have}} blue, liver or sandy colouration, {{all three of}} which may have tan points. Bedlingtons carry {{what is known as}} the greying gene, a {{dominant}} trait carried on the G locus. This gene causes puppies born with black or dark brown fur to <b>lighten</b> to grey or liver with age. The fur of the Bedlington creates a shape on the top of the dog's head known as a topknot. Although most modern breed standards call for the dog's topknot to be lighter than its body, when the breed was first being formed there was at least one prominent breeder, Mr. Pickett, who believed that the topknot should be darker, not lighter.|$|E

5|$|The ensuing {{confusion}} allowed Belvidera to fire her stern chasers, killing {{six more}} men aboard President. Rodgers {{kept up the}} pursuit, using his bow chasers to severely damage Belvideras rigging, but his two broadsides had little effect. The crew of Belvidera quickly made repairs to the rigging. They cut loose her anchors and boats and pumped drinking water overboard to <b>lighten</b> her load, thereby increasing her speed. Belvidera soon gained enough speed to distance herself from President, and Rodgers abandoned the pursuit. Belvidera sailed to Halifax to deliver the news that war had been declared.|$|E

40|$|It is very {{important}} for electric power transmission line to protect the electric surge due to <b>lightening.</b> It is therefore indespensable to forecast the <b>lightening.</b> The measurement of the electric charge of snow fragments and rain dorops is intended for examining the relations of the electric charge of them, the snow falling and the <b>lightening.</b> It is carried out successively by a simple method which consists of an accumulating metal plate of the snow fragments on the porcelain insulator column and a high sensitive electrometer. It is found from the measurements that snow fragments with both electric polarities fall down alternatively and the almost same charge fall down in one falling period. A simple theory of <b>lightening</b> in winter is proposed based on the charge measurements. 電力送電線にとって雷撃による電気的サージを防ぐことは非常に大切である。それ故，雷撃の予測は不可欠である。降雪の電気量，降雪と雷撃の関係を調べるために，降雪の荷電量の測定を意図した。これは簡単な方法により，成功裡に行われた。この方法は長幹碍子の上に乗せた雪を集める金属板と高感度のエレクトロメータから構成されている。これらの測定から，両方の電気的極性をもつ雪が交互に降って来ることおよび一回の降雪の間にほぼ等量の電荷が降りて来ることが分った。これらの電荷測定にもとずき，冬季雷撃に関する簡単な理論を提案する...|$|R

5|$|There {{are very}} few Arabians {{registered}} as roan, and according to researcher D. Phillip Sponenberg, roaning in purebred Arabians is actually the action of rabicano genetics. Unlike a genetic roan, rabicano is a partial roan-like pattern; the horse does not have intermingled white and solid hairs over the entire body, only on the midsection and flanks, the head and legs are solid-colored. Some people also confuse a young gray horse with a roan because of the intermixed hair colors common to both. However, a roan does not consistently <b>lighten</b> with age, while a gray does.|$|E
5|$|Watney {{begins the}} 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli and the pre-positioned Ares IV MAV. To {{rendezvous}} with Hermes, Watney removes many components from the MAV, including the nose cone, to <b>lighten</b> it, {{replacing it with}} a piece of the Hab's canvas. As the MAV fails to reach the required speed and altitude, Lewis is forced to use maneuvering thrusters to change course and explosive decompression of Hermess internal atmosphere to reduce speed. When even that is not enough, Commander Lewis uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit, but still cannot reach Watney. Watney pierces the glove of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air to propel himself towards Lewis, effectively rescuing him after being alone for 560 Sols on Mars.|$|E
40|$|The {{popularity}} and prevalence {{of the practice}} of skin <b>lightening</b> in South Asian communities is widespread and the ideas behind the practice are deep-rooted. Skin <b>lightening</b> products are promoted using lifestyle advertising and this technique attracts and makes the product more relatable to its target audience. The trend to use skin <b>lightening</b> products and the advertisements promoting them have branched out into Canada as well, however, few consumers realize the harm that is brought on by purchasing and using the skin <b>lightening</b> products that are available in today's market. The framework surrounding the regulation of skin <b>lightening</b> products in Canada is inadequate and there are several gaps that need to be filled in order to better protect consumers. Like skin <b>lightening</b> products, tobacco products were also widely promoted using lifestyle advertising. In addition, the consumption and use of tobacco products also presents significant risks to consumers. Yet, tobacco regulation in Canada has undergone a major overhaul to address some of the same types of gaps that were initially found during its inception. Therefore, given the similarities in the methods of promotion coupled with the potential harm caused to consumers, this paper makes a case for similar frameworks to be put in place to regulate both types of products...|$|R

On 3July they sighted and chased Speedy, and Cochrane ordered the guns, boats, and provisions thrown overboard to <b>lighten</b> the ship. The French caught up nonetheless, and after narrowly avoiding the broadside of Desaix, Cochrane struck his colours. He was taken aboard Desaix, where her captain, Christy-Pallière, recognised Cochrane's accomplishments by refusing to accept his sword. Cochrane was taken along with the fleet and watched the Battle of Algeciras Bay from Desaix. He and the crew of Speedy were later exchanged after the battle. On returning to Gibraltar he was court-martialled for the loss of his ship, and honourably acquitted.|$|E
