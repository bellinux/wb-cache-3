40|$|A new multiobjective dynamic fuzzy genetic {{algorithm}} {{is applied to}} solve a fuzzy mixed-model assembly <b>line</b> <b>sequencing</b> problem in which the primary goals are to minimize the total make-span and minimize the setup number simultaneously. Trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are implemented for variables such as operation and travelling {{time in order to}} generate results with higher accuracy and representative of real-case data. An improved {{genetic algorithm}} called fuzzy adaptive genetic algorithm (FAGA) is proposed in order to solve this optimization model. In establishing the FAGA, five dynamic fuzzy parameter controllers are devised in which fuzzy expert experience controller (FEEC) is integrated with automatic learning dynamic fuzzy controller (ALDFC) technique. The enhanced algorithm dynamically adjusts the population size, number of generations, tournament candidate, crossover rate, and mutation rate compared with using fixed control parameters. The main idea is to improve the performance and effectiveness of existing GAs by dynamic adjustment and control of the five parameters. Verification and validation of the dynamic fuzzy GA are carried out by developing test-beds and testing using a multiobjective fuzzy mixed production assembly <b>line</b> <b>sequencing</b> optimization problem. The simulation results highlight that the performance and efficacy of the proposed novel optimization algorithm are more efficient than the performance of the standard genetic algorithm in mixed assembly <b>line</b> <b>sequencing</b> model...|$|R

Because all the long interspersed nuclear element (<b>LINE)</b> <b>sequences</b> were fragmented and nonfunctional, they were suitable for conducting phylogenetic study and, in particular, for estimating evolutionary time. Our study has revealed that MHC-B and MHC-C duplicated 22. 3 million years (Myr) ago, and the ape MICA and MICB duplicated 14. 1 Myr ago. We then estimated the divergence time of the rhesus monkey by using other orthologous <b>LINE</b> <b>sequences</b> in the class I regions of the three primate species. The result indicates that rhesus monkeys, and possibly the Old World monkeys in general, diverged from humans 27 - 30 Myr ago. Interestingly, rhesus monkeys were found to have not the pair of MHC-B and MHC-C but many repeated genes similar to MHC-B. These results support our inference that MHC-B and MHC-C duplicated after the divergence between apes and Old World monkeys...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAs {{the travel}} time covers a {{substantial}} part of picking processes in warehouses, an appropriate sequencing of picking lines within a batch is crucial to achieve high efficiency. Routing heuristics for line sequencing in order picking batches are well researched, documented and implemented in today's Warehouse Management Systems (WMS). For storage areas in practice where routing heuristics could hardly be applied, an optimisation routine could be an alternative. Based on a digitised network, the <b>Line</b> <b>Sequence</b> Optimisation (LSO) calculates the <b>line</b> <b>sequence</b> for a given batch with the minimum travel time. For a case study at a distributor in the electronic devices business segment, the quantitative evaluation showed an overall improvement potential of 7, 4 %.

The effective design of these lines requires that schedule for assembling the different products is determined. In this paper we tried to fit the sequencing problem with the main characteristics of make to order (MTO) environment. The problem solved in this paper is a multiple objective sequencing problem in mixed model assembly <b>lines</b> <b>sequencing</b> using weighted Sum Method (WSM) using GAMS software for small problem and an effective GA for large scale problems {{because of the nature}} of NP-hardness of our problem and vast time consume to find the optimum solution in large problems. In this problem three practically important objectives are minimizing: total utility work, keeping a constant production rate variation, and minimizing earliness and tardiness cost which consider the priority of each customer and different due date which is a real situation in mixed model {{assembly lines}} and it is the first time we consider different attribute to prioritize the customers which help the company to reduce the cost of earliness and tardiness.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{sequencing}} jobs, each of which is characterized by one {{of a large number of}} possible combinations of customer-specified options, on a paced assembly line. These problems arise frequently in the automotive industry. One job must be launched into the system at equal time intervals, where the time interval (or cycle time) is prespecified. The problem is to sequence the jobs to maximize the total amount of work completed, or equivalently, to minimize the total amount of incomplete work (or work overload). Since there is a large number of option combinations, each job is almost unique. This fact precludes the use of existing mixed model assembly <b>line</b> <b>sequencing</b> techniques. We first consider the sequencing problem for a single station which can perform two different sets of operations.

Unidirectional movement of the objects is assumed which simplifies the optical flow computation and makes it a simple method to implement. The usefullness and performance of the method is shown by an example comprising several vehicles of different speed. The performance evaluation shows good linearity and low error...|$|E

This typically requires the implementation of cost efficient, flexible production systems. Often, so called mixed-model assembly lines are employed, where setup operations are reduced to such an extent that various models of a common base product can be manufactured in intermixed sequences. However, the observed diversity of mixed-model lines makes a thorough sequence planning essential for exploiting the benefits of assembly line production.
