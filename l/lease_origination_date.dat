40|$|SYNOPSIS. Recent phylogenetic {{analyses}} of fossil and living crocodylians {{allow us to}} compare the taxonomic, geographic, and temporal distributions of morpholog-ical features, such as snout shapes. A few basic snout morphotypes—generalized, blunt, slender, deep, and excessively broad (‘‘duck-faced’’) —occur multiple times in distantly-related lineages. Some clades—especially {{those found in the}} Northern Hemisphere or with minimum <b>origination</b> <b>dates</b> in the Cretaceous or lower Ter-tiary—are morphologically uniform, but geographically widespread; crocodylian faunas of the early Tertiary tend to be composite, with sympatric taxa being dis-tantly related, and similar-looking taxa on different continents being close relatives. In contrast, crocodylian faunas of the later Tertiary tend to be more endemic, with local adaptive radiations occurring in Africa and Australia containing members of most basic snout shapes. Endemic radiations in Africa and Australia have largely been replaced by Crocodylus, which can be divided into subclades that may indi-vidually represent endemic adaptive radiations...|$|R

In a second step, the exogenous function is modeled with macroeconomic data or factors representing portfolio management impacts. Stress tests are performed by extrapolating the exogenous function using externally provided scenarios for extreme macroeconomic events. The resulting scenario is combined with the known maturation and quality functions. This process is repeated for each of a key set of rates, such as default rate, exposure at default, and loss given default in the context of Basel II. These key rate forecasts are combined to create total portfolio forecasts and stress tests. This approach is demonstrated in an analysis of the US Mortgage markets...|$|R
40|$|Many {{published}} cladograms report {{measures of}} stratigraphic congruence. Strong congruence between cladistic branching {{order and the}} order of first fossil occurrences is taken to support both the accuracy of cladograms and the fidelity of the record. Poor congruence may reflect inaccurate trees, a misleading fossil record, or both. However, it has been demonstrated that most congruence indices are logically or empirically biased by parameters that are not uniformly distributed across taxa or through time. These include tree size and balance, mean ghost range duration (gap size) and the range and distribution of <b>origination</b> <b>dates.</b> This study used 650 published cladograms to investigate the influence of these variables on the Gap Excess Ratio (GER). In a range of multivariate models, factors other than congruence per se explained up to 74. 5 % of the observed variance in GER amongst trees. Arthropods typically have poorer GER values than other groups, but the residual differences from our models are much less striking. The models also show no clear residual trend in GER through the Phanerozoic. Because the GER is strongly influenced by parameters related to cladogram size, balance and duration, comparisons across trees should be made with caution...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} information and incentive {{problems that can}} exist {{in the market for}} commercial mortgages that are pooled and repackaged as commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs). We find that mortgages that are originated by institutions with large negative stock returns in the quarters prior to the <b>origination</b> <b>date</b> tend to have higher credit spreads and default more than other mortgages with similar observable characteristics. Properties financed with these mortgages also exhibit weaker post-securitization operating performance. In addition, stock price loser institutions are anxious to securitize mortgages they originate more quickly. Finally we find that credit rating agencies require higher levels of subordination for CMBS pools (i. e., view these pools as riskier) that include more mortgages originated by underperforming originators. This evidence is consistent with reputation models in which poorly performing originators have less incentive to carefully evaluate the credit quality of prospective borrowers, thereby letting relatively riskier mortgages pass through their weaker screening standards.

40|$|Through-the-Cycle (TTC) PD is {{the long-run}} {{probability}} of default through a full credit cycle. It is a more suitable risk factor for the capital purpose than Point-in-time (PIT) PD as it is less sensitive to the fluctuations of the economic environment. Accurate forecasting of the TTC PD is an industry challenge for Australian banks {{due to the lack}} of data in sufficient long period of time. Furthermore, low default rates are often observed in the book of small and medium enterprises (SME), which imposes extra difficulty for the TTC PD estimation. To meet these challenges, this research proposes a TTC PD model constructed in a way similar to the Cox Proportional Hazard modeling framework by incorporating the long-term survivors. The variations of the hazard are explained by four components including the non-linear life-cycle effect, credit quality of the portfolio, macro-economic environment and seasonality effect.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of modelling historical data on retail credit portfolio performance, {{with a view to}} forecasting future performance, and facilitating strategic decision making. We consider a situation, common in practice, where accounts with common <b>origination</b> <b>date</b> (typically month) are aggregated into a single vintage for analysis, and the data for analysis consists of a time series of a univariate portfolio performance variable (for example, the proportion of defaulting accounts) for each vintage over successive time periods since origination. An invaluable management tool for understanding portfolio behaviour can be obtained by decomposing the data series nonparametrically into components of exogenous variability (E), maturity (time since origination; M) and vintage (V), referred to as an EMV model. For example, identification of a good macroeconomic model is the key to effective forecasting, particularly in applications such as stress testing, and identification of this can be facilitated by investigation of the macroeconomic component of an EMV decomposition. We show that care needs to be taken with such a decomposition, drawing parallels with the Age-Period-Cohort approach, common in demography, epidemiology and sociology. We develop a practical decomposition strategy, and illustrate our approach using data extracted from a credit card portfolio...|$|R

During his stay in London he observed many political figures and witnessed events at the Court of Star Chamber. It was during this time that he began penning his first extensive work Cardiff MS 5, also known as Phillipps 10823, which featured a collection of prose and poetry based loosely of the late medieval tradition.

40|$|Abstract. Monte Carlo {{simulation}} is {{a common}} method for studying the volatility of market traded instruments. It is less employed in retail lending, because of the inherent nonlinearities in consumer behavior. In this paper, we leverage the approach of Dual-time Dynamics to separate loan performance dynamics into three components: a maturation function of months-on-books, an exogenous function of calendar date, and a quality function of vintage <b>origination</b> <b>date.</b> Of these three, the exogenous function captures the impacts from the macroeconomic environment. As such, we might naturally want to generate scenarios for the possible futures of these environmental impacts. To generate such scenarios, we must go beyond the random walk methods most commonly applied {{in the analysis of}} market-traded instruments. Retail portfolios exhibit autocorrelation structure and variance growth with time that requires more complex modeling than a random walk. This paper describes work using ARMA and ARIMA models for scenario generation, rules for selecting the correct model given the input data, and validation methods on the scenario generation. We find when the goal is capturing the future volatility via Monte Carlo scenario generation, that model selection does not follow the same rules as for forecasting. Instead, test more appropriate to reproducing volatility are proposed, which assure that distributions of scenarios have the proper statistical characteristics. These results are supported by studies of the variance growth properties of macroeconomic variables and theoretical calculations of the variance growth properties of various models. We also provide studies on historical data showing minimum training lengths and differences by macroeconomic epochs. Key words.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{fossil record}} has {{suggested}} that clade growth may differ in marine and terrestrial taxa, supporting equilibrial models in the former and expansionist models in the latter. However, incomplete sampling may bias findings based on fossil data alone. To attempt to correct for such bias, we assemble phylogenetic supertrees {{on one of the}} oldest clades of insects, the Odonatoidea (dragonflies, damselflies and their extinct relatives), using MRP and MRC. We use the trees to determine when, and in what clades, changes in taxonomic richness have occurred. We then test whether equilibrial or expansionist models are supported by fossil data alone, and whether findings differ when phylogenetic information is used to infer gaps in the fossil record. Results There is broad agreement in family-level relationships between both supertrees, though with some uncertainty along the backbone of the tree regarding dragonflies (Anisoptera). "Anisozygoptera" are shown to be paraphyletic when fossil information is taken into account. In both trees, decreases in net diversification are associated with species-poor extant families (Neopetaliidae, Hemiphlebiidae), and an upshift is associated with Calopterygidae + Polythoridae. When ghost ranges are inferred from the fossil record, many families are shown to have much earlier <b>origination</b> <b>dates.</b> In a phylogenetic context, the number of family-level lineages is shown to be up to twice as high as the fossil record alone suggests through the Cretaceous and Cenozoic, and a logistic increase in richness is detected in contrast to an exponential increase indicated by fossils alone. Conclusions Our analysis supports the notion that taxa, which appear to have diversified exponentially using fossil data, may in fact have diversified more logistically. This in turn suggests that one of the major apparent differences between the marine and terrestrial fossil record may simply be an artifact of incomplete sampling. Our results also support previous notions that adult colouration {{plays an important role in}} odonate radiation, and that Anisozygoptera should be grouped in a single inclusive taxon with Anisoptera, separate from Zygoptera. </p...|$|R

From the results, I proposed that in addition to any wolf-mediated changes in elk densities, a recoupling of fire with increased elk predation risk {{in the presence of}} wolves may improve upland clonal aspen recruitment. To examine the potential for a trophic cascade from the perspective of elk, I measured vigilance behavior in female elk throughout the park during both winter and summer seasons. After vigilance behavior was recorded, I noted the distance to, and type of, objects that could have impeded observed female elk escape from predators. From my model selection procedure, I concluded elk foraging behavior appeared to vary with physical features in the landscape. This variation in foraging behavior with risk of predation provides a potential mechanism to explain the patchy release of preferred woody browse species within the Park. Therefore, in addition to density-mediated effects, the results are consistent with a behaviorally-mediated top-down trophic cascade between wolves, elk, and aspen...|$|R

The empirical estimates of the <b>origination</b> and collapse <b>dates</b> suggest an interesting migration mechanism among the financial variables : a bubble first emerged in the equity market during mid- 1995 lasting to the end of 2000, followed by a bubble in the real estate market between January 2001 and July 2007 and in the mortgage market between November 2005 and August 2007.

40|$|How do we collectively {{feel about}} our future? Do {{we look forward}} to it with anxiety or vigor? Are we {{apprehensive}} or optimistic of what the future will bring? Since mood affects performance and well-being, {{the answers to these questions}} matter greatly to anyone concerned with public policy. The web is awash with material indicative of public mood, collective forecasting and personal relics. Several efforts have been undertaken to assess emotional status from online sources such as blogs, emails, web sites (Balog & De Rijke 2006) and search engine queries (see, for example, Google Trends). However, these efforts are limited, by the nature of their source material, to hindsight and near-present observations. The work presented here is concerned with collective speculations about the future. We present a visual analysis of publicly available textual content from futureme. org, a popular web service that allows its users to send themselves emails to be delivered at a later date, up to 30 years in the future. Many of these emails resemble "confessional" time capsules: their content is intended to project the user???s present emotional state at the <b>origination</b> <b>date</b> towards the indicated delivery date. These emails fall into two broad categories of content: a) conjectures about the future and b) mementos regarding the present or the past. By aggregating mood indicators extracted from messages directed to future dates, we can thus assess short and long term shifts in the collective emotional perception toward a particular point in the future. This principle is related to "wisdom of crowd" phenomena as observed in finance and prediction markets (Surowiecki 2004). Numerous psychometric instruments to assess individual mood states and monitor their fluctuations over time exist, the most prominent of which is the 65 item Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire (McNair, Loor, & Droppleman 1971). The 6 dimensional factor analytical structure of the POMS (tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue and confusion) has been validated repeatedly (Norcross, Guadagnoli, & Prochaska 2006) and applied in hundreds of studies since its inception (McNair, Heuchert, & Shilony 2003). To make the POMS questionnaire applicable to the open-ended nature of email content, we extended the POMS set of 65 adjectives by nearly 793 synonyms using WordNet and Roget???s Thesaurus. We calculated the occurrences of extended POMS terms in the content of 30, 000 publicly available "future" emails and mapped them to a normalized six-dimensional mood vector representing levels of tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue and confusion. These mood vectors were grouped according to the delivery date of the original email, resulting in a set of mood state vectors. Statistically significant mood changes were detected especially for depression and vigor indicators. The computation of mood levels was then implemented with a more specific textual analysis of the entire email corpus, aimed at identifying manifestations of conjectures and mementos. The results, presented in this poster, blend two different visual representation of the content analyzed: an "emotional timeline" - a cumulative depiction of mood levels between 2007 and 2036 - and a superimposed topic map of mementos and conjectures - an ontological model of commonly used terms and adjectives illustrating the chains of word association...|$|R

The methods modify a technique proposed in Phillips, Wu and Yu (2010) and provide a technology for identifying bubble behavior and consistent <b>dating</b> of their <b>origination</b> and collapse. The tests also serve as an early warning diagnostic of bubble activity. Seven relevant …nancial series are investigated, including three …nancial assets (the Nasdaq index, home price index and asset-backed commercial paper), two commodities (the crude oil price and platinum price), one bond rate (Baa), and one exchange rate (Pound/USD).

The empirical estimates of the <b>origination</b> and collapse <b>dates</b> suggest an interesting migration mechanism among the …nancial variables: a bubble …rst emerged in the equity market during mid- 1995 lasting to the end of 2000, followed by a bubble in the real estate market between January 2001 and July 2007 and in the mortgage market between November 2005 and August 2007. After the subprime crisis erupted, the phenomenon migrated selectively into the commodity market and the foreign exchange market, creating bubbles which subsequently burst at the end of 2008, just as the e¤ects on the real economy and economi...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} the limit theory of real-time dating algorithms for bubble detection that were suggested in Phillips, Wu, and Yu (PWY; International Economic Review 52 [2011], 201 – 26) {{and in a}} companion paper by the present authors (Phillips, Shi, and Yu, 2015; PSY; International Economic Review 56 [2015 a], 1099 – 1134. Bubbles are modeled using mildly explosive bubble episodes that are embedded within longer periods where the data evolve as a stochastic trend, thereby capturing normal market behavior as well as exuberance and collapse. Both the PWY and PSY estimates rely on recursive right-tailed unit root tests (each with a different recursive algorithm) {{that may be used}} in real time to locate the <b>origination</b> and collapse <b>dates</b> of bubbles. Under certain explicit conditions, the moving window detector of PSY is shown to be a consistent dating algorithm even in the presence of multiple bubbles. The other algorithms are consistent detectors for bubbles early in the sample and, under stronger conditions, for subsequent bubbles in some cases. These asymptotic results and accompanying simulations guide the practical implementation of the procedures. They indicate that the PSY moving window detector is more reliable than the PWY strategy, sequential application of the PWY procedure, and the CUSUM procedure. 55 page(s...|$|R
