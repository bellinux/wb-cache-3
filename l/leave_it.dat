5|$|Experience of Antarctic or Arctic waters {{was almost}} entirely lacking within the 50-strong party {{and there was}} very little special {{training}} in equipment or techniques before the ship set sail. Dogs were taken, as were skis, but the dogs succumbed to disease in the first season. Nevertheless, the dogs' performance impressed Scott, and, despite moral qualms, he implemented the principle of slaughtering dogs for dog-food to increase their range. During an early attempt at ice travel, a blizzard trapped expedition members in their tent and their decision to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> resulted in the death of George Vince, who slipped over a precipice on 11 March 1902.|$|E

5|$|Shelley {{writes of}} her {{overwhelming}} happiness in Italy and her sadness {{at having to}} <b>leave</b> <b>it.</b> At the end of September, her money to return to England fails to arrive, so Percy Florence and his friends return without her. Her funds eventually arrive, and she journeys to England alone. In the letters covering her return journey, she describes the sublime scenery through which she travels, particularly the Simplon Pass and waterfalls in Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|The chicks' {{eyes open}} after about four days and, {{at an age}} of about eight days, the young birds get their first down. If both parents perish, the ensuing {{intensive}} begging sounds of the young often attract replacement parents which feed them until they can sustain themselves. All the young in the nest <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> {{during the same period}} of a few hours. At this stage, they are normally able to fly. They start feeding themselves partly after one or two days, and sustain themselves completely after 7 to 10 days, 14 at the latest.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} edit {{was almost}} three hours long; to hone it to 141 minutes, Eastwood cut {{material from the}} first part of the film to get to Collins' story sooner. To improve the pacing he also cut scenes that focused on Reverend Briegleb. Eastwood deliberately left the ending of the film ambiguous to reflect the uncertain fates of several characters in the history. He said that while some stories aimed to finish at the end of a film, he preferred to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> open-ended.|$|E
5|$|While killing {{raccoons}} {{is legal}} during the hunting season, typically September to February, some hunters merely tree the raccoon and then <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> unharmed. In competitive hunts, where {{the objective is}} to demonstrate the skill of the dog, killing or harming the raccoon will often result in disqualification. Hunting for the sport without killing the raccoon, which is equated to catch and release fishing, or chasing raccoons from crop fields is legal year-round.|$|E

5|$|A third {{milestone}} in Wodehouse's life came {{towards the end}} of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer Guy Bolton, who became Wodehouse's closest friend and a regular collaborator. Bolton and Kern had a musical, Very Good Eddie, running at the Princess Theatre in New York. The show was successful, but they thought the song lyrics weak and invited Wodehouse to join them on its successor. This was Miss Springtime (1916), which ran for 227 performances—a good run {{by the standards of the}} day. The team produced several more successes, including <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> to Jane (1917), Oh, Boy! (1917–18) and Oh, Lady! Lady!! (1918), and Wodehouse and Bolton wrote a few more shows with other composers. In these musicals Wodehouse's lyrics won high praise from critics as well as fellow lyricists such as Ira Gershwin.|$|E
5|$|Among the Pagans {{who use the}} Coldrum Stones {{for their}} ritual activities, there is general {{satisfaction}} with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in {{the centre of the}} monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires {{to do so in the}} same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.|$|E
5|$|At about eleven o'clock, Cox began urging Ashford to leave. When the two did <b>leave,</b> <b>it</b> {{was with}} Thornton, who {{accompanied}} Ashford closely, while Cox walked behind them. Instead {{of returning to}} Erdington, Ashford announced that {{she would go to}} her grandfather's house, stating that it was closer to work. This was true, but ignored the fact {{that she would have to}} return to Erdington to obtain her working clothes in the morning. Cox journeyed to Erdington, while Ashford and Thornton went off together. At about a quarter to three, a labourer saw Thornton leaving a friend's house with a woman, and greeted Thornton, but the woman (undoubtedly Ashford) held her bonnet over her face. Just before 4a.m., Cox was awakened by Ashford, seeking her working clothes. Ashford changed and hurried off, stating that she needed to be home before her uncle left for market. A returning reveller from Tyburn House saw her walking quickly. He was the last person known to see her alive.|$|E

5|$|Barcelona were {{expected}} to line up in a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Ronaldinho, Ludovic Giuly and Deco supporting Samuel Eto'o who would be deployed as the lone striker. They had doubts about the fitness of Lionel Messi going into the final. He had pulled a thigh muscle during the second leg of their match with Chelsea, and had not played since, though he {{was included in the}} 22 man squad for the final. Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard stated he would <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> late before deciding whether to select him. Despite being included in the squad Messi did not feature in the final. Arsenal {{were expected}} to line up in a 4–5–1 formation, with Thierry Henry as the sole striker. There was much discussion about whether José Antonio Reyes would take the place of Robert Pirès on the left of midfield. It had been announced before the match that this would be Pirès' last match as he had agreed to join Villarreal next season.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{feud with}} Rivadavia, who was {{appointed}} President of Argentina, San Martín offered his military services in the War with Brazil, but received no response. He sailed to the country when Rivadavia was deposed and replaced by the federal Manuel Dorrego, and the war ended in the interim. He intended to return anyway, as a federal government would spare him the persecution he would otherwise have received from the unitarians. He was unable to do as he planned. When his ship docked in Río de Janeiro he was informed that the unitarian Juan Lavalle had deposed Dorrego, and when he reached Montevideo he was informed that Lavalle had captured and executed Dorrego and begun a campaign of terror against all federals in the country. The ship arrived in Buenos Aires, but San Martín did not <b>leave</b> <b>it,</b> instead returning to Montevideo. Lavalle was unable {{to put down the}} federal rebellion against him, and offered San Martín the government. San Martín declined and returned to Brussels.|$|E
5|$|During the pouring rain, a {{young boy}} helps {{his mother and father}} leave a heavily chained toy box at the {{doorstep}} of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends with instructions to not be opened. The next day, Frankie has grown outraged about her job as the house caretaker; Mr. Herriman has been giving her endless chores to take care day after day without thanking her for any of it. When Frankie discovers the box left on the doorstep, Herriman instructs her to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> in the attic. In a fit of anger toward Herriman, she intentionally ignores the instructions given in the box and peeks inside it. She falls inside, only to discover it is a vast world filled with anthropomorphic toys and delectable treats. She hears and sympathizes with {{a young boy}}'s voice (Max Burkholder), later revealed to be the imaginary friend named World (given the name by the crew of the show), who has been living alone in the toy chest since his family left the box at Foster's.|$|E
