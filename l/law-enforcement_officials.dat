It was officially described as new to science in 1995 by mycologists Peter R. Johnston and Peter K. Buchanan. In his 1996 book Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World, Paul Stamets noted that the two authors are known to work with <b>law-enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> to assist in prosecuting those who illegally collect psychoactive mushrooms.|$|E

Due to the attention Bishop attracted {{as a result of}} the shooting, previous violent incidents in which she had been involved or implicated were reevaluated. She had drawn the attention of <b>law-enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> in 1986 when she shot and killed her brother in Braintree, Massachusetts, in an incident officially ruled an accident.

25|$|In the United States, racial {{profiling}} of minorities by <b>law-enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> {{has been called}} racial discrimination. Within {{the criminal justice system}} in the United States, minorities are convicted and imprisoned disproportionately when compared to the majority. As early as 1866, the Civil Rights Act and Civil Rights Act of 1871 provided a remedy for intentional racism in employment by private employers and state and local public employers. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 expanded the damages available in Title VII cases and granted Title VII plaintiffs the right to a jury trial.|$|E

50|$|Many {{members of}} the {{sovereign}} citizen movement believe that the United States government is illegitimate. JJ MacNab, who writes for Forbes about anti-government extremism, has described the sovereign citizen movement as consisting of individuals {{who believe that the}} county sheriff is the most powerful law-enforcement officer in the country, with authority superior to that of any federal agent, elected <b>official,</b> or local <b>law-enforcement</b> <b>official.</b> This belief comes from the movement's origins in the white extremist group Posse Comitatus.|$|R

The {{character}} was a Kantō torishimari shitsuyaku (関東取締執役), a <b>law-enforcement</b> <b>official</b> of the Tokugawa shogunate, with broad jurisdiction over the Kantō region surrounding the shogunal capital at Edo. A common alternative name for the post was Hasshū-mawari, alluding to the eight provinces (hasshū) of the region; the title incorporates this name.

An unnamed U.S. <b>law-enforcement</b> <b>official</b> described the investigation: [...] The U.S. government {{is in the process of}} reviewing his past activities in the United States, including his employment as a contract laborer at several U.S. nuclear power plants between 2002 and 2008.

5000|$|In {{the general}} election, Campbell faced former United States Congressman Bill McCollum, the Republican nominee. During the election, Campbell campaigned as a {{moderate}} Democrat, citing his experience in the Republican-dominated State Senate as an example. Both Campbell and McCollum agreed {{on the need to}} toughen laws against sexual predators and to push for additional protections against identity theft. Campbell advocated for a reduction of backlogs in the state's court system by hiring more prosecutors and public defenders and creating rehabilitation and pre-trial diversion programs, while McCollum argued for a limitation on lawsuits. The Terri Schiavo case was a major issue during the campaign, with McCollum attacking Campbell for changing his position on state intervention in the Schiavo case. Campbell said that, as a Catholic and {{as a moderate}} Democrat, he was [...] "desperate to find a way" [...] to intervene in the case, but could not find a constitutional way to do so. He, in turn, attacked McCollum for his record in Congress, where he sponsored legislation that would have removed [...] "whistle-blower protections in Medicaid fraud cases," [...] and for working a lobbyist representing large corporations. Campbell was endorsed by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune once again, which argued that he was [...] "more familiar with state issues than McCollum," [...] and that his [...] "philosophy is representative of mainstream Florida." [...] He was also endorsed by the Tallahassee Democrat, which noted that, although the two candidates were alike, Campbell [...] "deserves to be the state's top <b>law-enforcement</b> <b>official</b> because of his proven ability to foster bipartisanship and his record in private life as a top-flight attorney." [...] Ultimately, however, McCollum narrowly edged out Campbell, winning with 53% of the vote to Campbell's 47%.|$|R
2500|$|The New York Times {{published}} {{two articles}} on the series in mid-October, both written by reporter Tim Golden. One article, dealing mostly with {{the response of the}} Los Angeles black community to the stories, described the series' evidence as [...] "thin." [...] Golden also noted the controversy over Webb's contacts with Ross's lawyer. The other article, citing interviews with current and former intelligence and <b>law-enforcement</b> <b>officials,</b> questioned the importance of the drug dealers discussed in the series, both in the crack cocaine trade and in supporting the Nicaraguan Contras' fight against the Sandinista government.|$|E
2500|$|Since the Chechen {{conflict}} {{began in}} 1994, cases of young veterans returning embittered and traumatized {{to their home}} towns have been reported all across Russia. Psychiatrists, <b>law-enforcement</b> <b>officials,</b> and journalists have started calling the condition of psychologically scarred soldiers [...] "Chechen syndrome" [...] (CS), drawing a parallel with the post-traumatic stress disorders suffered by Soviet soldiers who fought in Afghanistan. According to Yuri Alexandrovsky, {{deputy director of the}} Moscow Serbsky Institute in 2003, at least 70% of the estimated 1.5million Chechnya veterans suffered CS. Many of the veterans came back alcoholic, unemployable and antisocial. Thousands were also physically disabled for life and left with very limited help from the government.|$|E
2500|$|Casolaro's family {{argued that}} he had been murdered; that before he left for Martinsburg, he had {{apparently}} told his brother {{that he had been}} frequently receiving harassing phone calls late at night; that some of them were threatening; and that if something were to happen to him while in Martinsburg, it would not be an accident. They also cited his well-known squeamishness and fear of blood tests, and stated they found it incomprehensible that if he were going to commit suicide, he would do so by cutting his wrists a dozen times [...] A number of <b>law-enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> also argued that his death deserved further scrutiny, and his notes were passed by his family to ABC News and Time Magazine, both of which investigated the case, but no evidence of murder was ever found.|$|E
40|$|Although {{substantive}} {{due process}} {{is one of}} the most confusing and controversial areas of constitutional law, it is well established that the Due Process Clause includes a substantive component that “bars certain arbitrary wrongful government actions ‘regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them. ’” The Court has recognized substantive due process limitations on <b>law-enforcement</b> personnel, publicschool <b>officials,</b> government employers, and those who render decisions that affect our property rights. Government officials who act with intent to harm or with deliberate indifference to our rights have been found to engage in conduct that “shocks the judicial conscience” contrary to the guarantee of substantive due process. A burgeoning body of case law, however, has limited substantive due process as a viable restraint on the conduct of officials in the executive branch of government. Some appellate courts have restricted substantive due process to claims involving deprivation of a fundamental right. Others have rejected all claims where only deprivation of property is at stake, or they have dismissed such claims where state law provides a remedy, thus confounding the treatment of procedural and substantive due process claims. Further, the courts have narrowly defined the concept of a duty of care to immunize raw abuses of executive power. This Article asserts that substantive due process should be recognized as a meaningful limitation on arbitrary abuses of executive power and that victims of such abuse should not be relegated to the vagaries and increasing hurdles imposed by state tort law. The Article summarizes the origins and development of substantive due process in the Supreme Court as a limitation on legislative, judicial, and executive power. It then critiques the positions adopted by federal appellate courts regarding substantive due process as a limitation on executive power. It addresses separation of powers and federalism concerns that have been used to justify a crabbed interpretation of substantive due process. Finally, the Article suggests ways for attorneys litigating on behalf of government employees, arrestees and detainees, students, and landowners to invoke substantive due process as a meaningful restraint against misuse of executive power...|$|R
2500|$|There {{has been}} a number of {{high-profile}} cases of human rights abuses connected to business in Russia. [...] Among other abuses, this most obviously involves abuse of article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These include the case of the former heads of the oil company Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and [...] Platon Lebedev whom [...] Amnesty International declared prisoners of conscience, and the case of the lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, whose efforts to expose a conspiracy of criminals and corrupt <b>law-enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> earned him sustained abuse in prison which led to his death. An analogous case was the death in custody of the businesswoman Vera Trifonova, who was in jail for alleged fraud. Cases such as these have contributed to suspicion in other countries about the Russian justice system, which has manifested itself in the refusal to grant Russian extradition requests for businessmen fleeing abroad. Notable instances of this are the cases of the tycoon Boris Berezovsky and former Yukos vice president Alexander Temerko in the UK, the media magnate Vladimir Gusinsky in Spain and Greece, Leonid Nevzlin in Israel and Ivan Kolesnikov in Cyprus. [...] A case that will test the attitude of the French authorities to this issue is that of the shipping magnate Vitaly Arkhangelsky. The Wikileaks revelations indicated the low level of confidence other governments have in the Russian government on such issues. Cases involving major companies may gain coverage in the world media, but there are many further cases equally worthy of attention: a typical case involves the expropriation of assets, with criminals and corrupt <b>law-enforcement</b> <b>officials</b> collaborating to bring false charges against businesspeople, who are told that they must hand over assets to avoid criminal proceedings against them. [...] A prominent campaigner against such abuses [...] is Yana Yakovleva, herself a victim who set up the group Business Solidarity in the aftermath of her ordeal.|$|E
