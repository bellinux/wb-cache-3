Finding ways to improve the durability of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> will lead to improved service lives and lower life cycle costs. Research and field trials have been directed towards improving joint performance since at least the 1960 s. Most of that work was addressed improving the density at and around the joint. This report summarizes an extensive review of the pertinent literature, a review of state specifications and inspection of several trial projects in Indiana related to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> construction and performance.

40|$|To obtain {{background}} information for code prescriptions for the shear and torsion interaction in hollow core floors, finite element analyses of some basic cases were made. A simplified global model for complete floors developed in Lundgren et al. (2003) was used. A set-up with two simply supported hollow core units connected along a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> {{and support of}} tie beams was modelled. The hollow core units were loaded with a point load situated at the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint.</b> Several parameters were varied; i. e. the section height, the slab length, an assumed gap in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint,</b> stiffness of the tie beams, and the loading position. When the two hollow core units are loaded, they will deflect and rotate equally much, as there is symmetry. Therefore, no shear force will be transferred in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint.</b> Compressive contact forces will appear at the upper edge of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint,</b> while the <b>lower</b> edge of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> will open without any force transfer. The main studied result from the analyses is {{the distribution of the}} contact forces along the upper edge of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint.</b> The results show that the contact forces in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> had typically a peak where the point load was applied. When no gap was assumed in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> and the tie beams were assumed to be infinitely stiff, compressive contact forces appeared towards the supports, almost in triangular shaped blocks. These blocks decreased and vanished when the stiffness of the tie beams decreased, and also when there was a gap in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint.</b> In the analyses where a gap was assumed in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> between the hollow core units, no contact is obtained for low loads. After a certain load, contact is obtained, and the contact forces between the hollow core units start to act. This load can be predicted by hand calculations. As the analyses are non-linear, the results from various load cases can not be super positioned. This was demonstrated in one example. In the studied set-up with only two hollow core units, the deflections in horizontal bending were of the same magnitude as the deformations due to torsional rotations. Therefore, very small reductions in torsional moments were observed. The torsional moments would most likely be more reduced if floors with more hollow core units were studied...|$|R
40|$|In {{conventional}} construction practices, a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> is sawed in a PCC (Portland Cement Concrete) pavement {{to control}} concrete shrinkage cracking between two lanes of traffic. Sawing a joint in hardened concrete {{is an expensive}} and time consuming operation. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> is not a working joint (in comparison to a transverse joint) as it is typically tied with a tie bar at 30 inch spacing. The open joint reservoir, left by the saw blade, typically is filled or sealed with a durable crack sealant to keep incompressibles and water from getting into the joint reservoir. An experimental joint forming knife has been developed. It is installed under the paving machine to form the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> in the wet concrete {{as a part of}} the paving process. Through this research method, forming a very narrow <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> during the paving process, two conventional paving operations can be eliminated. Joint forming eliminates the need of the joint sawing operation in the hard concrete, and as the joint that is formed does not leave a wide-open reservoir, but only a hairline crack, it does not need the joint filling or sealing operation. Therefore, the two conventional <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> sawing and sealing operations are both being eliminated by this innovation. A laboratory scale prototype joint forming knife was built and tested, initially forming joints in small concrete beams. The results were positive so the method was proposed for field testing. Initial field tests were done in the construction season of 2001, limited to one paving contractor. A number of modifications were made to the knife throughout the field tests. About 3000 feet of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> was formed in 2001. Additional testing was done in the 2002 construction season, working with the same contractor. About 150, 000 feet of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> was formed in 2002. Evaluations of the formed joints were done to determine <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> hairline crack development rate and appearance. Additional tests will be done in the next construction season to improve or perfect the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> forming technique...|$|R

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the level of compaction at the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> and determine the effect of segregation on the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> performance. Five paving projects with the use of traditional butt joint, infrared joint heater, edge restraint by milling and modified butt joint with the hot pinch <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> construction techniques were selected in this study. For each project, field density and permeability tests were made and cores from the pavement were obtained for in-lab permeability, air void and indirect tensile strength.

In general, this study finds that the minimum required joint density should be around 90. 0 % of the theoretical maximum density based on the AASHTO T 166 method. The restrained-edge by milling and butt joint with the infrared heat treatment construction methods both create the joint density higher than this 90. 0 % limit.

The premature deterioration of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> occurs {{in the form of}} cracking and/or raveling.

40|$|Low <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> density {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of the major issues relating to poor asphalt pavement performance.

40|$|<b>Longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> are {{the portion}} of the road where two lanes meet and are formed because the lanes are paved at {{different}} times. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> tend to be the weakest portion of the roadway, and yet few regulations exist to control their quality. Currently, Arkansas specifications for asphalt pavement do not include any requirements for the measurement of joint quality. The purpose of this research project is to determine the most effective method for evaluating <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> in hot-mix asphalt (HMA) pavements. Most of the literature concerning <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> focuses on density as the determining factor of quality because density is easy to measure, and denser pavement is less likely to allow air and water to penetrate. Numerous studies have determined that joints with higher densities perform better than those with lower densities. However, measurement of other asphalt properties could provide a good alternative to density testing as a means of quality control. For this project, three field test sites were chosen, one site which was of good quality, one which was of marginal quality, and one which was of poor quality. Several cores were taken from these sites across the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> and analyzed using the following methods: AASHTO T- 166 (SSD), AASHTO T- 331 (CoreLok), Kuss displacement, percent water absorbed, ASTM PS- 129 (permeability), AASHTO T- 30 (gradation), and oven derived percent binder content. The data resulting from the various laboratory tests were visually and statistically analyzed to determine which method of testing yields data having the most direct correlation to the performance of the core and provides the greatest discrimination among the different levels of joint quality.

40|$|Some of the {{problems}} that are observed in Hot-Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavements are related to insufficient compaction of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints,</b> segregation, or low material density. In particular, construction of quality <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> continues {{to be one of the}} most problematic areas for HMA pavement performance and this problem may have a special role in porous asphalt concretes; because of the difficulty in compacting the unconfined edges, lower density zones can occur at the joints and therefore the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> between asphalt mats can deteriorate faster than other areas. This contributes to the ultimate performance, then to pavement life and life cycle cost. Therefore, road agencies are now setting more rigorous compliance standards for joint density, requiring best-practice construction and effective quality control in order to guarantee a 100 % pay factor. These issues influence maintenance and rehabilitation costs and scheduling and there are many consequences for performance-based planning, programming and management. In the light of above facts, a literature review on construction equipments and measurement methods has been performed. The main objective has been confined to the analysis of the reliability of high-speed devices in detecting density non-conformities especially in joints area. In order to pursue the objectives, in-lab and on-site experiments were designed and performed; different measurement methods (vacuum sealing method, portable non-nuclear devices, etc.) have been used.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 31 st Annual Southern African Transport Conference 9 - 12 July 2012 "Getting Southern Africa to Work", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. A major airport in Namibia was recently rehabilitated by first milling off a delaminated asphalt layer and inlay with a continuously graded asphalt layer and placing an ultra-thin proprietary surface friction course on top. The asphalt inlay work included a cross fall correction with asphalt wedge build up on the centre line tapering off to the off keel area of the runway. Construction was interrupted for 6 months due to unnaturally high rainfall. This interruption came after the asphalt inlay work was completed and a short section of the surface friction course on the main runway was placed. At resumption of work and prior to completion of the proprietary surface friction course white deposits were observed on the surface. The white deposit tended to concentrate along the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> of the previously constructed asphalt. The origin of the white deposit was investigated and could be linked to salt leaching from aggregates in the underlying layers. The delaminated asphalt repair {{has led to a}} heightened awareness of durability problems. Previous problems on this airport were linked to stripping, crescent cracking and delamination of the previous asphalt overlay. The subsequent field and laboratory work enabled a clear linkage with the construction quality control of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> in general. Densities, air voids and binder content could be checked against specification tolerances via normal quality control testing. Air and water permeability testing were done as well as wet and dry modified Lottmann tests. Cores were also inspected visually to give indicative values of permeability. This investigation served to emphasise the lack of focus of current specifications used on quality control of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> construction and their longer term durability impact. The investigation provided the basis for improved quality control and specifications for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> of asphalt paving in future.

The surface of the HCU is seldom given proper treatment prior to casting the concrete topping. The texture and surface moisture condition of the HCU just before receiving concrete topping may affect the overall strength of the slabs when the concrete topping and the HCU act compositely during service. This paper presents the experimental study on shear-flexure capacity of composite slabs using HCU and concrete topping. Full scale three point load test are carried out on 14 composite slab specimens with different surface roughness and surface condition of the HCU before casting the concrete topping. The surface roughness considered is smooth and rough, while the moisture conditions are dry, ponded and optimum wet. The effect of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> between the HCU panels is also considered. The experimental results are also compared with predicted values using the available equation in Eurocode 2 and an equation published by a previous researcher.

The optimum HCU surface condition which can produce highest stiffness and shear strength is rough and wet conditions, while the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> between HCU panels reduces the slab shear strength.

40|$|Three {{types of}} {{concrete}} pavements {{are commonly used}} (1) : • Jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP) has transverse joints spaced less than about 5 m apart and no reinforcing steel in the slab. JPCP may, however, contain steel dowel bars across transverse joints and steel tiebars across <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints.</b> • Jointed reinforced concrete pavement (JRCP) has transverse joints spaced about 9 to 12 m apart and contains steel reinforcement in the slab.

40|$|Many bridges on {{the local}} highway system need replacement. Local governments rely on the South Dakota Department of Transportation (SDDOT) to help replace the {{deficient}} bridges. With limited resources, SDDOT can only help replace about 30 bridges statewide each year, causing a backlog of local bridges in need of replacement. The current standard bridge used in these replacements is the double tee precast girder bridge for its relatively low construction cost, outsourced design, and short construction duration. The expected design life of these bridges was 50 to 70 years, but some built less than 40 years ago already need replacement.

Inspection of South Dakota pavements after construction using ground penetrating radar (GPR) has revealed that many bars were misaligned or missing. More bars were reported missing or misaligned when automatic inserters were used. Many states, including South Dakota, have banned the use of automatic inserters based on a lack of confidence regarding the placement of tie bars. The long-term effect on the pavement from misaligned or missing bars is unknown, but it can be assumed that additional maintenance costs and reduced pavement life are both possible. A NCHRP study concluded recently (Khazanovich et al. 2009) developed guidelines for dowel alignment in concrete pavements. The report provided a quite comprehensive summary on state-of-the-art practice and research related to dowel misalignment in concrete pavements. Regardless of the dowel placement method, it is concluded that there will be misalignment issues related to tolerance, material, and placement procedures. The study adopted four major categories for misalignments proposed by Tayabj...|$|R

40|$|<b>Longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> {{are one of}} the {{critical}} factors that cause premature pavement failure. Poor-quality joints are characterized by a low density and high permeability; which generates surface distresses such as ravelling or longitudinal cracking. Density has been traditionally considered as the primary performance indicator of joint construction. Density measurements consist of taking cores in the field and determining their density in the laboratory. Although this technique provides the most accurate measure of joint density, it is destructive and time consuming. Nuclear and non-nuclear gauges have been used to evaluate the condition of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> non-destructively, but did not show good correlation with core density tests. Consequently, agencies are searching for other non-destructive testing (NDT) options for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> evaluation. NDT methods have significantly advanced for the evaluation of pavement structural capacity during the past decade. These methods are based either on deflection or wave velocity measurements. The light weight deflectometer (LWD) is increasingly being used in quality control/quality assurance to provide a rapid determination of the surface modulus. Corresponding backcalculation programs are able to determine the moduli of the different pavement layers; these moduli are input parameters for mechanistic-empirical pavement design. In addition, ultrasonic wave-based methods have been studied for pavement condition evaluation but not developed to the point of practical implementation. The multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW) consists of using ultrasonic transducers to measure surface wave velocities in pavements and invert for the moduli of the different layers. In this study, both LWD and MASW were used in the laboratory and in the field to assess the condition of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints.</b> LWD tests were performed in the field at different distances from the centreline in order to identify variations of the surface modulus. MASW measurements were conducted across the joint to evaluate its effect on wave velocities, frequency content and attenuation parameters. Improved signal processing techniques were used to analyze the data, such as Fourier Transform, windowing, or discrete wavelet transform. Dispersion curves were computed to determine surface wave velocities and identify the nature of the wave modes propagating through the asphalt pavement. Parameters such as peak-to-peak amplitude or the area of the frequency spectrum were used to compute attenuation curves. A self calibrating technique, called Fourier transmission coefficient (FTC), was used to assess the condition of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> while eliminating the variability introduced by the source, receivers and coupling system. A critical component of this project consisted of preparing an asphalt slab with a joint in the middle that would be used for testing in the laboratory. The compaction method was calibrated by preparing fourteen asphalt samples. An exponential correlation was determined between the air void content and the compaction effort applied to the mixture. Using this relationship, an asphalt slab was prepared in two stages to create a joint of medium quality. Nuclear density measurements were performed at different locations on the slab and showed a good agreement with the predicted density gradient across the joint. MASW tests were performed on the asphalt slabs using different coupling systems and receivers. The FTC coefficients showed good consistency from one configuration to another. This result indicates that the undesired variability due to the receivers and the coupling system was reduced by the FTC technique. Therefore, the coefficients were representative of the hot mix asphalt (HMA) condition. A comparison of theoretical and experimental dispersion curves indicated that mainly Lamb waves were generated in the asphalt layer. This new result is in contradiction with the common assumption that the response is governed by surface waves. This result is of critical importance for the analysis of the data since MASW tests have been focusing on the analysis of Rayleigh waves. Deflection measurements in the field with the LWD showed that the surface modulus was mostly affected by the base and subgrade moduli, and could not be used to evaluate the condition of the surface course that contains the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints.</b> The LWDmod software should be used to differentiate the pavement layers and backcalculate the modulus of the asphalt layer. Testing should be performed using different plate sizes and dropping heights in order to generate different stress levels at the pavement surface and optimize the accuracy of the backcalculation. Finally, master curves were computed using a predictive equation based on mix design specifications. Moduli measured at different frequencies of excitation with the two NDT techniques were shifted to a design frequency of 25 Hz. Design moduli measured in the field and in the laboratory with the seismic method were in good agreement (less than 0. 2 % difference). Moreover, a relatively good agreement was found between the moduli measured with the LWD and the MASW method after shifting to the design frequency. In conclusion, LWD and MASW measurements were representative of HMA condition. However, the condition assessment of medium to good quality joints requires better control of {{the critical}} parameters, such as the measurement depth for the LWD, or the frequency content generated by the ultrasonic source and the coupling between the receivers and the asphalt surface for the MASW method...|$|R
