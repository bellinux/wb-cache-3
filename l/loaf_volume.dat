40|$|A {{separation}} {{procedure was}} developed using S-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography under mildly acidic conditions {{to establish the}} effect of 70 % (v/v) ethanol extractable proteins on bread-making quality. The separation of a 70 % (v/v) ethanol extract of gluten was scaled up successfully from 3 mg to 60 g protein. The use of denaturing and dissociating agents, such as urea or guanidine-HCl, was unnecessary. The pilot-scale fractionation yielded five fractions that were bound to, and eluted from, the column. The fractions differed in gliadin composition as evidenced by lactate-PAGE, SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC. The fractions were virtually free of lipid. Isolated fractions were evaluated for their effects on bread-making quality using a pan loaf baking test. The unbound fraction (D) contained lipids, mainly mono- and digalactosyldiacylglycerols, and it increased (cv. Obelisk flour) or decreased (cv. Camp Rémy flour) <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> at additions of up to 0 · 5 % on flour weight. At higher levels of addition it had a strong negative effect on <b>loaf</b> <b>volume.</b> The unfractionated extract (containing some fraction D) or the recombined fractions improved <b>loaf</b> <b>volume.</b> All individual fractions improved <b>loaf</b> <b>volume,</b> but to different extents.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the importance of}} substrate selectivity for xylanase functionality in bread making, the secondary binding site (SBS) of xylanases from Bacillus subtilis (XBS) and Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis was modified. This resulted in two xylanases with increased relative activity toward water-unextractable wheat arabinoxylan (WU-AX) compared to water-extractable wheat arabinoxylan, i. e., an increased substrate selectivity, without changing other biochemical properties. Addition of both modified xylanases in bread making resulted in increased <b>loaf</b> <b>volumes</b> compared to the wild types when using weak flour. Moreover, maximal volume increase was reached at a lower dosage of the mutant compared to wild-type XBS. The modified xylanases were able to solubilize more WU-AX and decreased the average degree of polymerization of soluble arabinoxylan in dough more during fermentation.

40|$|Brown bread was {{produced}} by adding three bran fractions of different sizes (Pollard 0. 75 mm 1. 8 mm), from the same grist, to a common base white flour. The addition of bran caused loaf volumes to be depressed and crumb structures to be coarse. Bran components appeared to affect gluten functionality by changing its physicochemical characteristics through a subtle interplay of chemical and physical effects. Pollard depressed loaf volumes the most, and Digestive bran the least. This could probably be attributed to differences in chemical composition. Pollard had the highest fat content, and therefore probably the highest lipoxygenase and glutathione concentrations, which adversely affected <b>loaf</b> <b>volume.</b> Subjecting the brans to a dry heat-treatment, which inactivated lipase and reduced the total reducing substances of which glutathione is part, increased <b>loaf</b> <b>volume.</b> This suggests that a chemical effect of the bran (probably the lipid metabolising enzymes lipase and lipoxygenase, as well as glutathione) is {{at least in part}} responsible for <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> depression. Heat treatment had the greatest effect on decreasing <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> depression in breads baked with Pollard and the least on breads Baked with Digestive bran, indicating a greater chemical effect in brans with smaller particle size. A similar baking study was conducted with bran from 10 widely differing wheat samples (all of the same nominal particle size range). The different brans caused different levels of <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> depression. In all cases, dry heat-treatment of the brans decreased total reducing substances, inactivated lipase and increased <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> and height. However, the loaves still differed somewhat in volume. It is possible that differences in chemical composition of the different bran sources also accounted for these differences in <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> depression. In addition to the difference in chemical compositions of the different brans, the higher loaf volumes of breads baked with Digestive bran, compared to those baked with Pollard, could also possibly be explained by the large, flaky Digestive bran particles trapping air bubbles in the dough. These air bubbles possibly provided extra nucleation sites for gas cells, as well as oxygen, which improved oxidation of the gluten and functioning of the oxidising agent ascorbic acid. The theory that Digestive bran particles trap air, could also probably explain why at low levels of addition, breads baked with Digestive bran had higher loaf volumes than the white bread controls. However, for large bran particles to be able to increase <b>loaf</b> <b>volume,</b> they have to be free of epicarp hairs. Heat treatment did not result in all the brans producing loaves of the same volume, suggesting that a physical effect of the bran is also responsible for <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> depression. CAT scanning of proofing dough showed a uniform crumb structure in white bread dough in contrast with bubbles in brown bread dough, which were large and irregular. Bubbles became more elongated as proofing progressed. Bran probably ruptured the gas cell walls of the foam structure, leading to coalescence of the bubbles. Coalescence caused larger and irregular bubbles with lower internal pressures, probably resulting in lower loaf volumes. It is concluded that there is a subtle interplay between the chemical and physical effects of bran on brown bread, which determines the extent of <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> depression. The addition of either large, epicarp hair free bran particles, or heat-treated smaller bran particles to white base flour are potential methods of optimising brown bread loaf size.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryJon FaubionWhole {{wheat flour}} {{has become a}} popular {{ingredient}} in baked goods. Consumers are seeking the added benefits of consuming healthy phytochemicals and bioactive compounds. As the demand for wholemeal flour increases {{it is important to}} understand the factors contributing to changes in whole wheat flour breadmaking quality as a function of both wheat and flour age. In wholemeal flour, the lipid composition appears to be a factor causing variable baking quality. Changes that occur in both freshly harvested wheat and milled flour can cause variations in baking quality. Bakers’ attempts to adjust formulations and processes are often unsuccessful. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of aging both new crop wheat and freshly milled flour at 2 different temperatures on baking quality and glycolipid composition. This study aged freshly harvested Overley hard red winter wheat at RT (23 ˚C) and FZ (- 26 ˚C) for 8, 50, and 91 days before milling. Whole wheat flour baking and lipid extraction studies were performed incrementally over 31 days of flour storage after each milling. Glycolipid structure and amounts were measured using automated electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. The glycolipids analyzed in this study were DGDG (digalactosyldiglycerol), MGDG (monogalactosylmonoglycerol), MGMG (monogalactosylmonoglycerol), and DGMG (digalactosylmonoglycerol). Both the wheat and flour stored at - 26 ˚C produced larger mean <b>loaf</b> <b>volumes</b> than did the 23 ˚C treatment for all 3 wheat ages. The FZ and RT DGDG:MGDG ratios were similar over both wheat and flour age so changes to the glycolipid fraction did not appear to be the cause of the significant difference between volumes of bread baked from samples stored at RT and FZ. There was limited change in mean volume over flour age except for an increase at the FZ 91 day point. The DGDG:MGDG ratios were generally unchanged over flour age. <b>Loaf</b> <b>volumes</b> were the same over wheat age except for an unexpected drop during the 50 day wheat study. The corresponding DGDG:MGDG ratios did not show any significant differences over wheat age.

40|$|Addition of 2 % high {{molecular}} weight rye water-soluble pentosans to European bread wheat flour greatly changed its rheological and functional breadmaking properties. When the rye fractions were added as dry powder, {{the changes in the}} mixograph curves were smaller than the changes of the fractions that were presoaked in water and then added. Under the latter conditions, the mixograph peak height and area under the curve were greatly increased. Response surface methodology showed that the <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> of breads obtained from wheat flour is strongly dependent on mixing time and water addition. The addition of the rye components as a fine powder to wheat flour increased the water-absorption level and the range of mixing times for obtaining a bread of constant <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> and crumb quality.

Comparison of untreated bran material with bran material that was either toasted to obtain a lower hydration rate than untreated bran, or presoaked to exclude hydration rate effects showed that a slower hydration rate led to increased mixing time but did not affect baking absorption nor maximum <b>loaf</b> <b>volume.</b> Also the use of milled bran, having a higher hydration rate compared to untreated bran, led to a decreased mixing time compared to when untreated bran was used. Again, water absorption and bread <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> remained unaffected. Results suggest that a high wheat bran hydration rate leads to faster immobilization of the water required for hydration of the bran rich dough system and hence enhances friction and energy input by the mixer in the developing dough.

40|$|The {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide coenzymes [NAD(P) (H) ] {{are strong}} redox agents naturally present in wheat flour, and are indispensable cofactors in many redox reactions. Hence, it is not inconceivable that they affect gluten cross-linking during breadmaking. We investigated the effect of increasing concentrations of NAD(P) (H) on gluten cross-linking, dough properties, and bread volume using two flours of different breadmaking quality. Separate addition of the four nicotinamide coenzymes did not significantly affect mixograph properties. While addition of NAD(+) hardly affected bread volume, supplementation with NADP(H) and NADH significantly decreased <b>loaf</b> <b>volumes</b> of breads made using flour of high breadmaking quality.

The Pegaso bread wheat near-isogenic lines (NILs) included addition, variation and/or deletion of major loci coding for HMW-GS, LMW-GS and gliadins. The waxy wheat lines (Svevo and N 11 set) included wild, partial and complete waxy lines. Triticale translocations include 1 R. 1 D and 1 A. 1 D lines (GDS 7, Trim, Rhino and Rigel sets) with HMW-GS 5 + 10 and 2 + 12. The main goal {{of the study was}} to establish the usefulness of NILs as appropriate materials to investigate the structure-function relationships of wheat proteins and to evaluate the performance of unique triticale translocations and waxy wheat lines. Effect of genetic variation on phytochemical (phenolic acid and policosanol) contents was also studied. Innovative methods like MALLS, Lab-on-a-chip and micro (10 g) baking were utilized along with traditional analytical methods. Results confirmed the potential of using NILs in understanding the effects of certain proteins coded at specific loci that might often be targeted in breeding programs. Removal of expected chain terminators at Gli- 1 /Gli- 2 loci causes a shift in MWD to higher values, reflected in higher UPP and dough strength. Lines with HMW-GS 5 + 10 were clearly separated from 2 + 12 lines in terms of dough strength and UPP. The present study obtained evidence that modified ω-gliadins acts as chain terminators and cause reduction of protein polymer size and thus shifts in MWD. Marked differences in terms of milling characteristics, protein composition and ultimately in end-use functionality were observed with various waxy wheat null lines. <b>Loaf</b> <b>volumes</b> with waxy wheat flour alone were higher than a 50 % blend with commercial wheat; however, breads were unacceptable to consumers in all aspects.

Significant (p < 0. 05) improvements of <b>loaf</b> specific <b>volume</b> (from 2. 24 to 3. 93 mL/g) and crumb firmness (from 9. 14 to 4. 67 N) were achieved by contemporarily including egg white and extra-virgin olive oil in the formulation. Cassava breads containing both these ingredients obtained the best scores from panelists for all the test breads examined and resulted attractive as the wheat bread prepared as reference...|$|R
40|$|In the {{previous}} study, we investigated effect of physical state of nonpolar lipids of gluten-starch model dough. This experiment examined a real wheat flour dough system {{to assess the}} role of fat crystals in the breadmaking processes. These experiments were performed with a baking test and an investigation of wheat flour dough through rheological measurements (both large and small deformations), scanning electron microscopy, and ultracentrifugation. As a result, {{we found that the}} added oil was absorbed in the gluten structure, causing the aggregation of the gluten, which gave rise to more elastic behavior. In contrast, solid fat seemed to be distributed uniformly between the starch granules in the dough, reducing the friction between the starch granules and facilitating thin gluten gel layers. These properties lead to the lower G(prime) value and the increased viscous behavior, which yields an increase in <b>loaf</b> <b>volume.</b> In addition, the supposed mechanism behind the large <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> described in {{the previous}} study was that fat provides a uniform distribution of the dough components, and that the dough can thus expand easily, resulting in a larger <b>loaf</b> <b>volume,</b> which was supported in the wheat flour dough system. In conclusion, we found that thin, expandable gluten films and the uniform dispersion of gluten and starch granules in the dough are prerequisites for attaining better baking performance...|$|E
40|$|Various {{amounts of}} sodium D-erythrobate (D-ErA-Na, sodium D-erythro-ascoibic acid) {{were added to}} a basic baking formula, and effects of the {{additive}} on the bread quality of the wheat flour were investigated by measuring the <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> of the bread, the gelatinization temperature of starch in the dough, change of SH content in gluten, viscoelastic properties of the dough, and by scanning electron microscopic observations. The addition of L-ascorbic acid (L-AsA) (8 ppm) or D-ErA-Na (20 ppm) increased the <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> of the bread baked. With the addition of 50 ppm of the additives, the gelatinization temperature of starch was decreased, to 80 ℃ {{by the addition of}} L-AsA from the 82 ℃ of the control, and to 81 ℃ by D-ErA-Na. By addition of 50 ppm of D-ErA-Na, the mechanical stability of the dough was distinctly improved, compared with the case where D-ErA was added. The computerized image analysis of the distribution of the gas cells showed some good relationships between the size of gas cells and the <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> of the bread baked. The improvement in the physical properties of the dough and the resulting bread would be caused by the formation of SS cross-linkages as a result of mild oxidation of SH groups by addition of D-ErA-Na. The relation between structural changes in the gluten and starch, and the improvement in the quality of the breads are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Optimum {{mixing time}} and water {{absorption}} levels of composite wheat flours {{were evaluated by}} response surface methodology. Water absorption was correlated with <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> in breadmaking where wheat flour was substituted at 0, 15, or 30 % by wheat starch, cassava starch, or cassava flour. The significance of the mixing time was less clear-cut. Baking {{results showed that the}} reduced breadmaking potential of wheat flour with partial substitution is not solely a function of gluten dilution. Indeed, <b>loaf</b> <b>volume</b> data showed that the breadmaking potential of a substituted wheat flour is determined by the degree of substitution as well as the type of substitute. Clear differentiation of the substitutes occurs during baking, not at the fermentation stage of the dough. Differential scanning calorimetry showed no drastic differences in the gelatinization properties of the doughs made from substituted flours. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryEkramul HaqueThe {{effect of}} enzyme in temper water on wheat milling {{performance}} and flour quality was studied. Five independent variables, enzyme concentration, incubation time, incubation temperature, tempered wheat moisture content, and tempering water pH, were studied. An enzyme cocktail consisting of cellulase, xylanase, and pectinase was used at 5 different concentrations. A single pure variety of hard red winter wheat was tempered under defined conditions following an RSM central composite design which required 33 tests including 7 replicates. Each treatment had 5 levels: high, medium high, medium, medium low, and low. After tempering, the physical {{characteristics of the}} wheat kernel were determined by using the Single Kernel Characterization System. An experimental laboratory mill (Ross Mill) was used to mill wheat into flour. Thirteen streams of flour, and additional streams of bran, shorts, red dog, and germ were obtained. Product yield, protein, ash, and flour color were evaluated. The data were analyzed and compared using the software SAS and RSM Plus. The data showed that incubation time was the only significant factor affecting the tempered wheat hardness (p< 0. 05). The treatments affected the flour yield from the break rolls more than that from the reduction rolls. However, a maximum point for flour yield was not found. The relationship between treatments and flour yield was established with a prediction model equation. Also, the enzyme effect on the dough properties and bread making were investigated. The treatments {{did not affect the}} optimum water absorption for the flours. However, enzyme treated flours showed shorter mixing times. Regardless of the differences in mixing times, the specific <b>loaf</b> <b>volumes</b> were not significantly different for the all treatments. Bread baked from the flour milled from enzyme treated wheat did not show a positive effect on bread staling...|$|R
40|$|Kernel texture {{is a major}} {{determinant}} of end-use quality of wheat. Durum wheat is known for its very hard texture, which influences how it is milled and for what products it is well suited. We developed soft kernel durum wheat lines via Ph 1 b-mediated homoeologous recombination with Dr. Leonard Joppa. The Hardness locus from Chinese Spring was successfully transferred to cv. Svevo durum wheat; Svevo was back-crossed 3 times to produce ‘Soft Svevo’ (Morris et al. 2011). Soft Svevo had SKCS kernel hardness, break flour yield, flour starch damage, and flour particle size similar to soft hexaploid wheat (Murray et al. 2016). Compared to Svevo, Soft Svevo had much reduced Solvent Retention Capacity (SRC) -water, -carbonate, and -sucrose; whereas SRC-lactic acid was similar to Svevo. Similarly, Mixograph, Farinograph and Alveograph results indicated much reduced water absorption, but similar gluten strength. Cookie diameter of Soft Svevo was markedly larger and similar to soft wheat (Murray et al. 2017). The energy required to produce flour was dramatically reduced: 624 ± 200 kJ/kg flour for Svevo vs. 146 ± 20 kJ/kg flour for Soft Svevo. When Soft Svevo was crossed to 10 CIMMYT durum parents, half-sib families and full-sib lines within families showed significant differences in SKCS hardness, break flour and total flour yields, starch damage, SRCwater, -carbonate, -sucrose, and -lactic acid, and flour SDS sedimentation volume. Cookie diameters ranged from 8. 68 to 9. 57 cm. Mean bread <b>loaf</b> <b>volumes</b> for families ranged from 680 to 838 cm 3. Results illustrate the significant effect of the Puroindoline genes and the Hardness locus on kernel texture and end-use quality, and demonstrate that soft kernel durum wheat has properties similar to soft hexaploid wheat. Further, the hard durum parent has a significant effect on end-use quality traits by contributing superior alleles for soft wheat milling, flour properties, dough and bread quality...|$|R
40|$|The aims of this {{research}} were {{to determine the effects}} of milk composition (fat, whey protein, lactose and salts) and process (homogenisation) factors on the formation of emulsions and microencapsulated powder particles and to relate these to the properties of the powder, especially susceptibility to fat oxidation. The effect of composition, using sodium caseinate and lactose on the production of high fat powders was also studied. Finally, new developments in microencapsulated milk powders were undertaken in collaboration with industry using sodium caseinate and lactose. Overall, the microencapsulation process should provide a technique to extend the shelf-life of sensitive fats and flavours and to produce high fat powders for a range of end-uses. The major components of the emulsions used to make the microencapsulated powders influenced fat globule diameter and stability, but the minor salt components also affected globule size and stability. Free flowing high fat (70 %) powders with sodium caseinate and lactose as encapsulants were manufactured using a tall-form Niro spray dryer with fluidised beds. A flavoured ingredient using a by-product flavoured fat as the flavour agent was made using the same encapsulants. Microencapsulated powders were incorporated into baked goods as multi-functional ingredients. They increased <b>loaf</b> <b>volumes</b> and improved handling and processability of the dough, thereby extending the product range for fat and other dairy ingredients used for baking. Microencapsulated 80 % fat blends were manufactured for biscuit formulations to overcome the handling problems associated with bulk fats. This sub-project also gave rise to a leading role in a EU FAIR project on the microencapsulation of fish oil for use in functional foods using milk components as the sole encapsulants.
