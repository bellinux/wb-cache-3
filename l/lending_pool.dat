50|$|Mortgage brokers {{can obtain}} loan {{approvals}} from the largest secondary wholesale market lenders in the country. For example, Fannie Mae may {{issue a loan}} approval to a client through its mortgage broker, which can then be assigned to any {{of a number of}} mortgage bankers on the approved list. The broker will often compare rates for that day. The broker will then assign the loan to a designated licensed lender based on their pricing and closing speed. The lender may close the loan and service the loan. They may either fund it permanently or temporarily with a warehouse line of credit prior to selling it into a larger <b>lending</b> <b>pool.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the determinants of}} international financial institutions (IFIs) ?s lending decisions to Pakistan. At the example of three major IFIs, the World Bank, IMF and ADB, this paper suggests that political economic factors, notably bureaucratic interest of international civil servants and major shareholders? economic interest belong to the most relevant determinants of international <b>lending.</b> <b>Pooled</b> Tobit estimation analysis for the period ever since when these institutions established their lending instruments to developing countries, confirm this hypothesis. Recipients? need is shown to have some relevance as well but {{not as strong as}} bureaucratic interest. Further analysis suggests that IDA and ADB lending is more interest oriented than lending by the IBRD and IMF...|$|R
50|$|The {{industry}} is not well publicized and is largely centered in California, several Western states, and New York. Lenders are predominantly small, highly specialized mortgage brokers familiar with commercial real estate lending. The trend in California is towards mortgage funds or mortgage pools, which are structured and operate similar to commercial banks. Private Money Bankers or Real Estate Bankers, are groups, individuals, companies or funds, that pool private money, and then <b>lend</b> those <b>pooled</b> funds for profit.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple {{general equilibrium model}} of financial intermediation, entrepreneurship and economic growth. In this model, the role of financial intermediation is to pool savings and to <b>lend</b> the <b>pooled</b> funds to an entrepreneur, who in turn invests the funds in a new production technology. The adoption of the new production technology improves individual real income. Thus financial intermediation promotes economic growth through affecting individuals’ saving behaviour and enabling {{the adoption of a}} new production technology. financial intermediation, entrepreneurship, economic growth...|$|R

30|$|For Airbnb, {{the initial}} idea of sharing extra {{bedrooms}} is good, {{but the idea}} has been converted to commercial businesses, particularly in big cities like New York and San Francisco. For instance, in New York City, many hosts control multiple listings and over 200 properties in some cases [44]. As mentioned earlier, the academic realm has no consensus on the definition of sharing economy, possibly because of differing interpretations of the act of sharing [10]. Many definitions of sharing economy do not fall into strict concepts of sharing. Some prior conceptualizations (e.g., Belk [20]) assume reciprocity and joint possessions, but these definitions do not truly reflect the practices of sharing economy services such as Airbnb [23]. Belk [20] distinguishes prototypical characteristics of sharing and commodity exchange. Later, Belk [16] identifies commercial car-sharing businesses such as Zipcar and for-profit home-sharing organizations like Airbnb as pseudo-sharing. According to Belk [16], such sharing is not prosocial sharing because “sharing includes voluntary <b>lending,</b> <b>pooling</b> and allocation of resources, and authorized use of public property (sharing), but not contractual renting, leasing, or unauthorized use of property by theft or trespass (pseudo-sharing).” Ozanne and Ballantine [56] argue that sharing behaviors reduce consumption of specific brands or product categories, and thus, they are an alternative to consumption: anti-consumption. Additionally, many of the initial startups that partook in sharing economy have quit operations or changed directions. Many {{of those who have}} stayed have ended the person-to-person narrative as a marketing technique and have begun to compete on price. Thus, the sharing economy has evolved to look less unique and revolutionary, a development which deepens the concerns about its legitimacy.|$|R
40|$|Savings group (SG) {{models are}} praised for {{achieving}} financial inclusion for the poorest {{at a very}} low cost. Promoted by international NGOs, SG models are inspired by indigenous savings and credit associations (ROSCAs). SG models however differ in that they prescribe <b>lending</b> the <b>pooled</b> savings to group members for an interest. The interest rate aims to (1) boost capital accumulation, (2) allocate scarce capital efficiently, and (3) remunerate and incentivize savers. This paper builds on a six-month fieldwork conducted in South Kivu (DR Congo) consisting of direct observations of SG meetings and interviews with SG participants and practitioners. We study the gaps between SG practitioners’ objectives and SG participants’ perceptions and practices related to the interest rate. Our research pays {{particular attention to the}} local context and local norms that interfere with SG practitioners’ objectives. Our analysis highlights three gaps. First, SG participants turn savings into credit for security purposes rather for rapid capital accumulation. Second, credit allocation decisions are guided by fairness and security concerns rather than efficiency. Third, SG participants often regard the accumulated interest as belonging to the group and to active borrowers rather than to passive savers. Our results invite development actors to pay greater attention to the potential risks of the SG approach for its participants. Despite the common appellation “savings groups”, this microfinance innovation builds upon credit and strongly encourages its members to go into debt...|$|R
40|$|The {{nearly equal}} lunar and solar angular sizes as {{subtended}} at the Earth is {{generally regarded as}} a coincidence. This is, however, an incidental consequence of the tidal forces from these bodies being comparable. Comparable magnitudes implies strong temporal modulation, as the forcing frequencies are nearly but not precisely equal. We suggest that {{on the basis of}} paleogeographic reconstructions, in the Devonian period, when the first tetrapods appeared on land, a large tidal range would accompany these modulated tides. This would have been conducive to the formation of a network of isolated tidal <b>pools,</b> <b>lending</b> support to A. S. Romer's classic idea that the evaporation of shallow pools was an evolutionary impetus for the development of chiridian limbs in aquatic tetrapodomorphs. Romer saw this as the reason for the existence of limbs, but strong selection pressure for terrestrial navigation would have been present even if the limbs were aquatic in origin. Since even a modest difference in the Moon's angular size relative to the Sun's would lead to a qualitatively different tidal modulation, the fact that we live on a planet with a Sun and Moon of close apparent size is not entirely coincidental: it may have an anthropic basis.

40|$|Formal social {{protection}} {{in the form of}} cash transfers has been adopted as one of the strategies for addressing child poverty in South Africa. The Child Support Grant (CSG) established in 1998, is the largest social assistance programme in South Africa in terms of coverage and is targeted at poor children through the primary caregiver. Prior to the grant, the majority of poor children in South Africa lacked access to formal {{social protection}} and mostly relied on informal safety nets provided by extended family, neighbours and community members. In view of the critical role that informal safety nets play in the provision of social support to poor children and for the CSG to produce maximum benefits for the recipients, the grant needs to be designed in a way that builds on pre-existing informal safety nets rather than displacing them. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the nature of the interaction between formal social protection, specifically the CSG, and informal safety nets, and to examine whether the grant displaces, ‘crowds out’ or strengthens, ‘crowds in’ the various forms of informal safety nets. The thesis also provides suggestions on how social protection measures might be designed to crowd in more informal support. The thesis is a literature review based study and involves systematic identification, selection and assessment of relevant texts. In terms of the theoretical framework, the study considers exchange versus altruism as motives for provision of informal support. Findings of the study seem to suggest that the grant had both positive and negative effects on the various forms of informal safety nets, albeit mostly modest effects, which might be due to the low value of the grant. The majority of the reviewed texts reported a slight increase in the social status of the grant recipients due to access to the CSG and some improvements in their capacity to borrow, <b>lend</b> and <b>pool</b> resources within the extended family and community. On the other hand, several texts reported a decrease in cash gifts and also father child support as a result of receiving the grant. A few texts in the review discovered modest positive effects on CSG recipients’ membership in stokvels compared to non-recipients of similar socio-economic status. Modest to no effects were also documented for the grant’s effects on child care and living arrangements. Generally, the findings of the review suggest that the effects of the grant, both positive and negative were quite modest to result in significant crowding out or crowding in of informal safety nets in South Africa. The thesis suggests caregiver support and use of conditionalties as possible designs to crowd in informal safety nets. Master in International Social Welfare and Health Polic...|$|R
