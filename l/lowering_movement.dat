There is still great variation between sub-regions in the South (see here for more information) and between {{older and younger}} generations.

Some generalizations include: the conditional merger of [...] and [...] before nasal consonants, the pin-pen merger; the diphthong [...] becomes monophthongized to lax and tense vowels often merge before [...] The South Midland dialect (now considered the upper portion of the Southern U.S. dialect and often not distinguished phonologically) follows the Ohio River in a generally southwesterly direction, moves across Arkansas and some of Oklahoma west of the Mississippi, and peters out in West Texas; it also includes some of North Florida, namely around Jacksonville. It most noticeably has the loss of the diphthong , which becomes [...] It also shows fronting of initial vowel of [...] to [...] (often lengthened and prolonged) yielding nasalization of vowels, esp. diphthongs, before raising of [...] to can't → cain't, etc.; fully rhoticity, unlike classical coastal varieties of older Southern American English, now mostly declined. In the Southern Vowel Shift of the early 1900s up to the present, [...] moves to become a high front vowel, and [...] to become a mid front unrounded vowel.

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{investigate}} the effects of light lower limbs training on physical function for preventing falls. Thirty-five elderly women, of which twenty-four (training group) participated in the training program and an other eleven as control (non-training group) did not, were followed up for six months. The training program consisted of radio gymnastics and about 15 minutes of simple raising and <b>lowering</b> <b>movement</b> of the lower limbs. The training group participated in the program five days a week. Quadriceps femoris knee extension strength (quadriceps strength) and walking speed of five meters (walking speed) were improved after six months but not after three months respectively. For frequencies of standing up from a chair for ten seconds as a dependent variable, walking speed and one foot standing time with opened eyes were significant independent variables but quadriceps strength was not. These results demonstrate that even the present lower limbs training program which was very light was effective in the improvement of muscular strength of lower limbs and walking speed for frail elderly women...|$|E
40|$|Multi-pantograph {{operation}} is a convenient and {{efficient way to}} operate railway rolling stock, but the influence between the pantographs makes the system more sensitive and vulnerable than a single-pantograph system. When a train passes through special sections or in an emergency condition, {{it is necessary to}} lower one or all of the pantographs and then raise them up again. In these circumstances, the motion of the pantographs can introduce a sudden impact to the catenary that may change the pantograph configuration, then disrupting the dynamic stability. To address the dynamic performance during pantograph raising and lowering, a numerical study on multi-pantograph {{operation is}} carried out with help of a 3 D pantograph-catenary finite element (FE) model under the conditions: up to three pantographs, various pantograph raising/lowering orders and different operating positions in a span. The results show that the leading pantograph is little influenced by the raising and <b>lowering</b> <b>movement</b> of any pantograph behind it. However, any trailing pantograph is significantly affected by any operation taking place ahead of it. The dynamic performance of the system depends on the pantograph spacing distance and the operational speed, but is little affected by the operating position in a span. To study auxiliary-pantograph operation where the leading pantograph works as an auxiliary pantograph, this paper shows how an optimal setting of the leading pantograph benefits the trailing pantograph and suggests specifying the speed where the leading pantograph gets into or out of service to avoid disruption.

First, Chomsky (1995 a) proposes the Move F(eature) hypothesis which implies that feature decomposition of a lexical item (or a syntactic object consisting of lexical items) is possible in covert syntax (LF). Assuming that LF Copy is a syntactic operation to construct a phonologically missing element in ellipsis structures, I propose the subset copy principle {{to the effect that}} a (proper) subset of the antecedent features can construct the contents of a phonologically missing element under LF Copy; the feature composition of a copy can be less than the feature composition of the original. I argue that the subset copy principle plays a significant role in LF construction and interpretation of both verbal morphology (Chapter 2) and nominal expressions (Chapter 4) in the elliptic site. A certain asymmetry in verbal morphology construction in VP-ellipsis receives a natural account under the subset copy principle, and a new theory of interpretation of nominal expressions in VP-ellipsis is developed, which gives an account of possible interpretation of VP-ellipsis when a full copy of the original cannot provide an appropriate LF representation. The second part of this work discusses the nature of Selection in the minimalist program. Selection has been stated as a D-structure property (e. g., Chomsky 1965, 1981) but it cannot be stated in such a way in the minimalist framework, since one of the characteristics of the minimalist program is its attempt to eliminate D-structure (and S-structure).

40|$|This project {{predominantly}} {{investigated the}} implications of spatial heterogeneity in the ecological processes of competition and infection. Empirical analysis of spatial heterogeneity was carried out using the lepidopteran species Plodia interpunctella. Using differently viscous food media, {{it was possible to}} alter the movement rate of larvae. Soft Foods allow the movement rate of larvae to be high, so that individuals can disperse through the environment and avoid physical encounters with conspecifics. Harder foods lower the movement rate of larvae, restricting the ability of individuals to disperse away from birth sites and avoid conspecifics encounters. Increasing food viscosity and <b>lowering</b> <b>movement</b> rate therefore has the effect of making uniform distributed larval populations more aggregated and patchy. Different spatial structures changed the nature of intraspecific competition, with patchy populations characterised by individuals experiencing lower growth rates and greater mortality because of the reduced food and space available within densely packed aggregations. At the population scale, the increased competition for food individuals experience in aggregations emerges as longer generational cycles and reduced population densities. Aggregating individuals also altered the outcome of interspecific competition between Plodia and Ephestia cautella. In food media that allowed high movement rates, Plodia had a greater survival rate than Ephestia because the larger movement rate of Plodia allowed it to more effectively avoid intraspecific competition. Also the faster growth rate, and so larger size, of Plodia allowed it to dominate interspecific encounters by either predating or interfering with the feeding of Ephestia. In food that restricts movement, the resulting aggregations cause Plodia to experience more intraspecific encounters relative to interspecific, reducing its competitive advantage and levelling the survival of the two species. Spatial structure also affected the dynamics of a Plodia-granulosis virus interaction and the evolution of virus infectivity. Larval aggregation forced transmission to become limited to within host patches, making the overall prevalence of the virus low. However potentially high rates of cannibalism and multiple infections within overcrowded host aggregations caused virus-induced mortality to be high, as indicated by the low host population density when virus is presented. Also aggregated host populations cause the evolution of lower virus infectivity, where less infective virus strains maintain more susceptible hosts within the aggregation and so possess a greater transmission rate. The pattern of variation in resistance of Plodia interpunctella towards its granulosis virus was found using two forms of graphical analysis. There was a bimodal pattern of variation, with most individuals exhibiting either low or high levels of resistance. This pattern was related to a resistance mechanism that is decreasingly costly to host fitness. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Swallowing problems, and the often-associated {{sequelae}} including pneumonia, malnutrition, and dehydration are common, potentially life-threatening conditions {{suffered by}} many elderly individuals. The combination of cognitive, physical, and sensory impairments commonly seen in individuals with dementia and following stroke {{often results in}} eating needs going unmet, leading to increased morbidity and premature mortality. The functional limitations {{of many of these}} individuals frequently result in decreased mealtime independence and necessitate extensive or total assistance (i. e., dependence) with consuming food and liquids. Despite the implication of increased safety associated with feeding assistance, the influence and potential risk of absent pre-oral cues are unclear, especially in an already taxed system. This study investigated the cooperative relationships between the sequential sensorimotor acts involved in eating and swallowing, focusing on the anticipatory stage, under various sensory-loss conditions. Kinematic data from the lips, jaw, and hand were obtained from 24 healthy younger adults (ages 18 - 30) and 24 healthy older adults (ages 70 - 85) under four different conditions: typical self-feeding, typical assisted feeding (i. e., loss of proprioceptive cues), sensory loss self-feeding (i. e., loss of visual cues and degradation of auditory cues), and sensory loss assisted feeding (i. e., loss/degradation of auditory, proprioceptive, and visual cues). During typical self-feeding, all participants began the mouth opening gesture shortly after the onset of hand movement toward the mouth and prior to the onset of oral sensation. However, differences in the timing of anticipatory onset and offset lip movements were observed between older and younger adults and also {{on the basis of the}} presence/absence of feeding dependency and sensory loss. Older adults initiated <b>lowering</b> <b>movement</b> earlier than younger adults given the availability of proprioceptive and/or visual cues. In addition to demonstrating earlier lip lowering, during both self-feeding conditions older adults more consistently attended to the timing between lip lowering onset and hand movement onset as compared to both the younger adults and other relative timing pairs. Given the absence of proprioceptive cues (i. e., during assisted feeding), the onset of anticipatory lip movement was delayed. Sensory loss (i. e., loss of visual cues, reduction in auditory cues) alone did not negatively impact the onset of lip movement for either group as compared to typical self-feeding. Conversely, the presence of sensory loss more negatively impacted the offset of lip movement as compared to the absence of proprioception (e. g., the offset of lip movement was later given only visual/auditory loss as compared to assisted feeding). The presence of both feeding dependence and sensory loss had the greatest negative impact on the timing of both the onset and offset of anticipatory lip movement. These findings suggest that deglutition should be considered as beginning prior to the onset of oral sensation and highlight the necessity of better understanding the role that pre-oral, or anticipatory, sensorimotor information may play in the overall eating and deglutitory process. As older adults consistently demonstrated a 2 ̆ 2 compensatory advantage 2 ̆ 2 via earlier and less variable movement onset given the availability of proprioceptive and/or visual cues, continued investigation into these age-related differences is important. This study provides a first step in clarifying the relationship between these pre-oral cues and anticipatory oral posturing during eating and swallowing, allowing for a better understanding of the potential for increased risk assisted feeding recommendations may elicit. However, the differences observed between older and younger adults, particularly under conditions of sensory loss, may be further exacerbated in a taxed system, potentially increasing risk for various patient populations...|$|E

This study aimed to study the functional relation between trunk and <b>lower</b> limb <b>movement</b> deficits during gait {{in children with}} spastic diplegia. Therefore, the relationship between trunk control in sitting, and trunk and <b>lower</b> limb <b>movements</b> during gait was explored in 20 children with spastic diplegia (age 9. 2 ± 3 yrs; GMFCS level I n= 10, level II n= 10). Trunk control in sitting was assessed with the Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS), a clinical measure that reflects the presence of an underlying trunk control deficit. Trunk movements during gait were measured with a recently developed trunk model including the pelvis, thorax, head, shoulder line and spine. <b>Lower</b> limb <b>movements</b> were assessed with the Plug-in-Gait model (Vicon(®)). Range of motion (ROM) of the different trunk segments was calculated, as well as the Trunk Profile Score (TPS) and Trunk Variable Scores (TVSs). Similarly, the Gait Profile Score (GPS) and Gait Variable Scores (GVSs) were calculated to describe altered <b>lower</b> limb <b>movements</b> during gait. Correlation analyses were performed between the presence of impaired trunk control in sitting (TCMS) and altered trunk movements during gait (ROM, TPS/TVSs) and between these altered trunk <b>movements</b> and <b>lower</b> limb <b>movements</b> (GPS/GVSs) during gait. A poorer performance on the TCMS correlated with increased ROM and TPS/TVSs, particularly for the thorax, indicating the presence of an underlying trunk control deficit. No significant correlation was found between the TPS and GPS, suggesting that overall trunk and <b>lower</b> limb <b>movement</b> deficits were not strongly associated. Only few correlations between specific lower limb deficits (GVSs for hip ab/adduction, knee flexion/extension and ankle flexion/extension) and TVSs for thorax lateral bending and rotation were found. This study provided first evidence that the altered trunk movements observed during gait should not be solely considered compensatory due to lower limb impairments, but that these may also partially reflect an underlying trunk control deficit. A better understanding of underlying trunk control deficits in children with CP may facilitate targeted therapy planning and ultimately can optimize a child's functionality. status: publishe...|$|R

The experimental sets included 5 cycles per minute (CPM 5), 10 cycles per minute (CPM 10) and 15 cycles per minute (CPM 15) on the passive cycling machine. ANS activity was measured using heart rate variability time domain analysis (RR interval, pNN 50, RMSSD and SDNN), frequency domain analysis (TF, LF, HF and LF/HF) and Poincaré plot analysis (SD 1, SD 2 and SD 1 /SD 2 ratio). The collected signal at rest served as the baseline (rest). Compared with the parameters at rest, the male subjects had decreased pNN 50, decreased SDNN, lower TP and LF power (ms 2), suppressed LF (n. u.), augmented HF (n. u.), suppressed LF/HF, decreased SD 2 and increased SD 1 /SD 2 ratios in response to CPM 5 or CPM 10 (all P < 0. 05).

Methods: this study investigated <b>lower</b> limb <b>movement</b> variability in individuals with {{peripheral arterial disease}}-intermittent claudication (n = 28) compared to individuals without peripheral arterial disease-intermittent claudication (control, n = 25). A further aim was to examine the efficacy of various techniques used to describe single joint movement variability. All participants underwent two-dimensional angular kinematics analysis of the lower limb during normal walking. Single joint movement variability was measured using linear (spanning set and coefficient of variation) techniques. Between group differences were examined by one-way ANOVA. Findings: the peripheral arterial disease-intermittent claudication participants displayed significantly higher levels of <b>lower</b> limb <b>movement</b> variability in all joints when assessed using the coefficient of variation technique. There were no significant between group differences using the spanning set technique. Interpretation: individuals with peripheral arterial disease-intermittent claudication have higher levels of <b>lower</b> limb <b>movement</b> variability and reduced walking speed compared to healthy age and mass matched controls. This variability may be an adaptation to the gradual onset of ischaemic pain in this population...|$|R

Discontinued after 1972 Olympics due to inconsistent judging criteria (such as should the lifter be allowed to bend backwards slightly when pressing, should a leg drive be allowed).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{kinematics}} of {{the human}} body is very complex. Every movement involves many joints, muscles and a special nervous control. The modern miniaturized inertial sensor systems prove to be valuable tools for rehabilitation medicine. We present the way a system of inertial sensors can be used to compare healthy and affected <b>lower</b> limb <b>movements</b> during gait...|$|R
