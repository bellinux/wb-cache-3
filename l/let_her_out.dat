25|$|Ganga arrogantly fell on Shiva's head. But Shiva calmly trapped her in {{his hair}} and <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> in small streams. The touch of Shiva further sanctified Ganga.

She is the only river to follow from all the three worlds – Swarga (heaven), Prithvi (Earth) and Patala (netherworld or hell). Thus is called Tripathagā(one who travels the three worlds) in Sanskrit language.|$|E

500|$|The {{story of}} Charlotte's flight and return was soon {{the talk of}} the town; Henry Brougham, a former MP and future Whig Lord Chancellor, {{reported}} [...] "All are against the Prince", and the Opposition press made much of the tale of the runaway Princess. [...] Despite an emotional reconciliation with his daughter, the Prince Regent soon had her conveyed to Cranbourne Lodge, where her attendants were under orders never to <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> of their sight. [...] She was able to smuggle a note out to her favourite uncle, Prince Augustus, Duke of Sussex. [...] The Duke responded by questioning the Tory Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, in the House of Lords. He asked whether Charlotte was free to come and go, whether she was allowed to go to the seaside as doctors had recommended for her in the past, and now that she was eighteen, whether the government planned to give her a separate establishment. [...] Liverpool evaded the questions, and the Duke was summoned to Carlton House and castigated by the Prince Regent, who never spoke with his brother again.|$|E

The attempt was unsuccessful, so on May 30 they visited the family house while Feng's husband was away at work. [...] At first, authorities tried to persuade her to voluntarily have an abortion. After several hours, she told the officials she was going out to buy food, and left them in her living room. Instead, she went to an aunt's house, but around 15 officials followed her.

[...] She flagged down a van and persuaded the driver to help her.
