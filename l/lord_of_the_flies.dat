5|$|A typical Robinsonade– a {{genre of}} fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe– {{and one of}} the most popular of its type, the book first went on sale in late 1857 and has never been out of print. Among the novel's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century British imperialism in the South Pacific, and the importance of hierarchy and leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flies</b> (1954), which inverted the morality of The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flies</b> evil is within them.|$|E

500|$|William Golding's 1954 novel <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flies</b> {{was written}} as a {{counterpoint}} to (or even a parody of) The Coral Island, and Golding makes explicit references to it. At {{the end of}} the novel, for instance, one of the naval officers who rescues the children mentions the book, commenting on the hunt for one of their number, Ralph, as a [...] "jolly good show. Like the Coral Island". Jack also makes an appearance in <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flies</b> as Jack Merridew, representing the irrational nature of the boys. Indeed, Golding's three central characters– Ralph, Piggy and Jack– are caricatures of Ballantyne's heroes. Despite having enjoyed The Coral Island many times as a child, Golding strongly disagreed with the views that it espoused, and in contrast <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flies</b> depicts the English boys as savages themselves, who forget more than they learn, unlike Ballantyne's boys. Golding described {{the relationship between the two}} books by saying that The Coral Island [...] "rotted to compost" [...] in his mind, and in the compost [...] "a new myth put down roots".

500|$|The series began {{development}} {{in the summer of}} 2003, when ABC senior vice president Thom Sherman [...] decided to order from Spelling Television a script based on an idea of network president Lloyd Braun, who envisioned a series that was a cross between the novel <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flies,</b> the movie Cast Away, the television series Gilligan's Island, and the popular reality show Survivor. Braun had titled his concept Lost after a failed reality show that had broadcast in 2001. Writer Jeffrey Lieber was contacted by Spelling's vice president of series development Ted Gold, and in September 2003 pitched to ABC the concepts for what he called Nowhere. Sherman approved the idea and hired Lieber to write a script, but Braun wound up rejecting Lieber's draft and subsequent rewrites. In January 2004 Braun contacted J. J. Abrams, who developed the TV series Alias for ABC, to write a new pilot script, which would retain the title Lost. Although initially hesitant, Abrams warmed up to the idea on the condition that the series would have a supernatural angle to it and he was assigned a writing partner. ABC executive Heather Kadin sent him Damon Lindelof, who had long intended to meet Abrams as he wished to write for Alias. Together, Abrams and Lindelof developed the characters and plot of Lost, along with creating a series [...] "bible" [...] which would store the major mythological ideas and plot points for an ideal five to six season run for the show. Lindelof and Abrams worked between January 13 and 16, when Lindelof sent a 21–page outline to ABC's executives. A complete first draft of the pilot script was delivered on February 24, and the teleplay kept on being revised, with the final script arriving on April 19. The development of the show was constrained by tight deadlines, as it had been commissioned late in the 2004 season's development cycle and Braun estimated that the whole process from writing to post-production took 6 to 8 weeks. Despite the short schedule, the creative team remained flexible enough to modify or create characters to fit actors they wished to cast.|$|E
