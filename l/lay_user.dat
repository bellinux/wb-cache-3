Old and New Testament scenes were shown side by side in works like the Speculum Humanae Salvationis, and the decoration of churches. The Gothic period coincided with a great resurgence in Marian devotion, in which the visual arts played a major part. Images of the Virgin Mary developed from the Byzantine hieratic types, through the Coronation of the Virgin, to more human and initimate types, and cycles of the Life of the Virgin were very popular. Artists like Giotto, Fra Angelico and Pietro Lorenzetti in Italy, and Early Netherlandish painting, brought realism and a more natural humanity to art. Western artists, and their patrons, became much more confident in innovative iconography, and much more originality is seen, although copied formulae were still used by most artists. The book of hours was developed, mainly for the <b>lay</b> <b>user</b> able to afford them – the earliest known example seems to have written for an unknown laywoman living in a small village near Oxford in about 1240 – and now royal and aristocratic examples became the type of manuscript most often lavishly decorated.

40|$|Database {{systems can}} be {{difficult}} to use. Part {{of the problem is that}} systems do not, for the most part, help a user when a query fails or fails to evaluate as the user expects. Schema and semantics of databases are often complex, and are rarely understood in entirety by the <b>lay</b> <b>user.</b> As a consequence, queries a <b>lay</b> <b>user</b> casts may not make sense with respect to a database's semantics. A system which returns informative responses beyond a query's answer set itself can elucidate the schema and semantics of the database, which can greatly help the user to cast the queries intended. Such a database system is to be called a cooperative database system (CDBS). A number of cooperative behaviors and methods have been introduced to be incorporated into information systems to make them more informative and, hence, easier to use.

However, in the current economic situation, transparency became an important factor {{where there is a}} need to fully understand and analyse a given financial model. In this paper, we will present a Genetic Type- 2 Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) for the modelling and prediction of financial applications. The proposed system is capable of generating summarized optimised type- 2 FLSs based financial models which are easy to read and analyse by the <b>lay</b> <b>user.</b> The system is able to use the summarized model for prediction within financial applications. We have performed several evaluations in two distinctive financial domains one for the prediction of good/bad customers in a credit card approval application and the other domain was in the prediction of arbitrage opportunities in the stock markets. The proposed Genetic type- 2 FLS has outperformed white box financial models like the Evolving Decision Rule (EDR) procedure (which is based on Genetic Programming (GP) and decision trees) and gave a comparable performance to black box models like neural networks while the proposed system provided a white box model which is easy to understand and analyse by the <b>lay</b> <b>user...</b>|$|E

40|$|The uptake of HIV {{testing has}} {{increased}} in sub-Saharan Africa {{over the past three}} decades. However, the proportion of people aware of their HIV status remains lower than required to change the pandemic. HIV self-testing (HIVST) may meet this gap. Assessment of readiness for and the acceptability of HIVST by <b>lay</b> <b>users</b> in South Africa is limited. This paper presents results from a formative study designed to assess the perceived usability and acceptability of HIVST among <b>lay</b> <b>users</b> using several self-test prototypes. Fifty <b>lay</b> <b>users</b> were purposively selected from rural and peri-urban KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Acceptability of HIVST was assessed using a simple post-test quantitative assessment tool addressing confidence, ease-of-use, intended future use and willingness to pay. In-depth qualitative interviews explored what participants felt about the HIVST and why, their willingness to recommend and how much they would pay for a test. The key finding is that there is high acceptability regardless of self-test prototype. Acceptability is framed by two domains: usability and perceived need. Perceived usability was explored through perceived ease of use, which, regardless of actual correct usage, was reported by many of the respondents. Acceptability is influenced by perceived need, expressed by many who felt that the need for the self-test to protect privacy and autonomy. Ease of access and widespread availability of the test, not at a significant cost, were also important factors. Many participants would recommend self-test use to others and also indicated that they would choose to conduct the test again if it was free while some also indicated being willing to buy a test. The positive response and readiness amongst <b>lay</b> <b>users</b> for an HIVST in this context prototype suggests {{that there would be a}} ready and willing market for HIVST. For scalability and sustainability usability, including access and availability that are here independent indications of acceptability, should be considered. So too should the desire for future use, as an additional factor pointing to acceptability. The results show high acceptability in all of these areas domains and a general interest in HIVST amongst <b>lay</b> <b>users</b> in a community in KwaZulu-Natal...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} years, Semantic Web and Linked Data {{technologies}} {{have reached the}} backend of {{a considerable number of}} applications. Consequently, large amounts of RDF data are constantly being made available across the planet. While experts can easily gather information from this wealth of data by using the W 3 C standard query language SPARQL, most <b>lay</b> <b>users</b> lack the expertise necessary to proficiently interact with these applications. Consequently, non-expert users usually have to rely on forms, query builders, question answering or keyword search tools to access RDF data. However, these tools have so far been unable to explicate the queries they generate to <b>lay</b> <b>users,</b> making it difficult for these users to i) assess the correctness of the query generated out of their input, and ii) to adapt their queries or iii) to choose in an informed manner between possible interpretations of their input. This paper addresses this drawback by presenting SPARQL 2 NL, a generic approach that allows verbalizing SPARQL queries, i. e., converting them into natural language. Our framework can be integrated into applications where <b>lay</b> <b>users</b> are required to understand SPARQL or to generate SPARQL queries in a direct (forms, query builders) or an indirect (keyword search, question answering) manner. We evaluate our approach on the DBpedia question set provided by QALD- 2 within a survey setting with both SPARQL experts and <b>lay</b> <b>users.</b> The results of the 115 filled surveys show that SPARQL 2 NL can generate complete and easily understandable natural language descriptions. In addition, our results suggest that even SPARQL experts can process the natural language representation of SPARQL queries computed by our approach more efficiently than the corresponding SPARQL queries. Moreover, non-experts are enabled to reliably understand the content of SPARQL queries. ...|$|R

Previous qualitative examination of Wikipedia articles on certain academics [36] and fields [37] suggested that the selection of authors and topics by academic community differs from the one suggested by the community of Wikipedians.
