5|$|French {{breeding}} of the Mérens is divided between two schools of thought. The first is traditional breeders seeking {{to preserve the}} original type, that of a <b>light</b> <b>draft</b> horse living high in the mountains year-round and retaining the hardiness for which the breed is known. The second comes from {{the conversion of the}} Mérens to a leisure horse in the 1980s, and aims to transform the physical type of the breed into a more sports-oriented horse to ensure the survival of the breed. This dichotomy has become a source of tension between farmers and users of the breed.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian horse has {{a rather}} short, high-set {{head with a}} broad forehead. The neck is arched and graceful, and the chest, back and loins broad and {{strongly}} muscled. The shoulders and croup are sloping, with a relatively high-set tail. Overall, the breed gives the impression of strength and agility. Their heavy and wavy mane and tail, arched necks and finely boned heads are all reminiscent of Andalusian and Barb ancestry. Their trot is described as flashy. They are hardy horses and easy keepers. Today, most Canadian horses are used as riding and driving horses, and {{are known for their}} jumping ability. They are seen in competition in almost every discipline, as well as for leisure riding. They can also be found in <b>light</b> <b>draft</b> work, trail riding, and working as a stock horse.|$|E
50|$|Draft {{horses and}} draft crossbreds are {{versatile}} breeds used {{today for a}} multitude of purposes, including farming, draft horse showing, logging, recreation, and other uses. They are also commonly used for crossbreeding, especially to light riding breeds such as the Thoroughbred, {{for the purpose of}} creating sport horses of warmblood type. While most draft horses are used for driving, they can be ridden and some of the <b>lighter</b> <b>draft</b> breeds are capable performers under saddle.|$|R
25|$|Aquidabã {{was built}} in England by Samuda Brothers; her keel was laid on 18 June 1883, and she was {{launched}} on 17 January 1885. The ship was a slightly smaller version of the earlier battleship , being shorter, having a <b>lighter</b> <b>draft,</b> and being equipped with only one funnel.

5|$|The Norman Cob or Cob Normand is a {{breed of}} <b>light</b> <b>draft</b> horse that {{originated}} {{in the province of}} Normandy in northern France. It is a mid-sized horse, with a range of heights and weights, due to selective breeding {{for a wide range of}} uses. Its conformation is similar to a robust Thoroughbred, and it more closely resembles a Thoroughbred cross than other French draft breeds. The breed is known for its lively, long-striding trot. Colors accepted by the breed registry include chestnut, bay and seal brown. There are three general subsets within the breed: horses used under saddle, those used in harness, and those destined for meat production. They are popular for recreational and competitive driving, representing France internationally in the latter, and are also used for several riding disciplines.|$|E
25|$|The Casco-class monitor was {{a unique}} class of <b>light</b> <b>draft</b> monitor built {{on behalf of the}} United States Navy for the Mississippi theatre during the American Civil War.

Twenty ships of the class were {{eventually}} built at great expense, but proved so unseaworthy when trialed that they were quickly sidelined, causing a public scandal.|$|E
25|$|On 18 July, Calypso, Fleche (Captain Thomas White), and the 20-gun sixth-rate post ship Arab (Captain Kieth Maxwell) and two {{or three}} gun-brigs drove on shore six French gun-vessels. However, the bank off Cape Grinez, and the shot and shells from the right face of its {{powerful}} battery, soon compelled the British to haul off from the shore. Arab suffered seven wounded {{and a great deal of}} damage. Fleche was the closest inshore owing to her <b>light</b> <b>draft</b> of water; she had five men severely wounded and damage to her rigging. Forster received a severe shoulder wound and had to give up command of Calypso.|$|E

500|$|The Nonius (...) is a Hungarian horse breed {{named after}} its Anglo-Norman {{foundation}} sire. Generally dark in color, it is a muscular and heavy-boned breed, similar in type to other <b>light</b> <b>draft</b> and driving horses. The breed was {{developed at the}} Imperial Stud at Mezőhegyes, Hungary by careful linebreeding. Originally bred {{to serve as a}} <b>light</b> <b>draft</b> and utility horse for Hungary's military, the breed became a useful agricultural horse during the 20th century. The depredations of World War II significantly reduced the Nonius' population, and in the decades after the war, a downturn in the usage of horses in Hungary sent many members of the breed to slaughter. Today the breed is bred by preservationists and is used in agriculture, leisure riding, and competitive driving sports. The largest numbers of Nonius horses are still found at Mezőhegyes, with representatives in other eastern European nations as well.|$|E
500|$|The Breton {{is used in}} many capacities, due to {{the various}} sub-types of the breed. [...] Smaller types can be used under saddle and for fast, <b>light</b> <b>draft</b> work, while [...] larger types are ideal for heavy draft and {{agricultural}} work. [...] They are also commonly used to improve other breeds through crossbreeding. Today, the breed {{is used as a}} draft horse on small farms, and is also used to gather seaweed. [...] It is also bred for meat production; horse meat is a dietary staple in many European countries, including France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland.|$|E
500|$|The Corlay Breton {{is derived}} from {{crossbreeding}} native stock with the Arabian and Thoroughbred, and is considered the real descendant of the original Breton. It has the same general features as the draft type but is smaller with a more dished face. [...] It was used mainly for <b>light</b> <b>draft</b> work that required speed and under saddle, and its numbers have been decreasing in recent years. The type {{is also known as}} the Cheval de Corlay, and is now extremely rare. It was also used in local races because of its speed, which it inherited from its Arabian and Thoroughbred ancestors.|$|E

2500|$|The Unadilla {{class was}} {{a class of}} gunboat built for the Union Navy at the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War. Ships of the class were also known as [...] "90-day gunboats" [...] due to their rapid construction.

500|$|They {{are used}} today in {{agricultural}} work, <b>light</b> <b>draft</b> and {{the sport of}} combined driving. The popularity of driving sport in Hungary rose sharply during the 1970s and 1980s. The Combined Driving World Championships are held every 2 years, and the most competitive event features teams of four horses. Of the 6 champions named between 1974 and 1984, all but one were Hungarian. The Nonius is slower and less suitable for other riding sports like dressage and show jumping than lighter horses. Smaller members of the breed with larger amounts of Arabian blood in their ancestry are more sought after as riding horses. The heavier horses are still commonly used for draft work, and are well-adapted to the [...] "heavy terrain" [...] of the Great Hungarian Plain.|$|E
500|$|The Breton is a {{breed of}} draft horse. [...] It was {{developed}} in Brittany, a province in northwest France, from native ancestral stock dating back thousands of years. The Breton was created through the crossbreeding of many different European and Oriental breeds. In 1909, a stud book was created, and in 1951 it was officially closed. The breed is often chestnut in color, and is strong and muscular. There are three distinct subtypes of the Breton, each coming from a different area of Brittany. The Corlay Breton is the smallest type, and is generally used for <b>light</b> <b>draft</b> and under saddle work. The Postier Breton is used for harness and light farm work. The Heavy Draft Breton is the largest subtype, and is generally used for the hardest draft work. This horse breed {{has been used in}} military, draft and agricultural capacities. It also has been used to improve and create many other draft breeds, and to produce mules.|$|E
500|$|The Rocky Mountain Horse is a horse breed {{developed}} {{in the state of}} Kentucky in the United States. Despite its name, it originated not in the Rocky Mountains, but instead in the Appalachian Mountains. A foundation stallion, brought from the western United States to eastern Kentucky around 1890, began the Rocky Mountain type in the late 19th century. In the mid-20th century, a stallion named Old Tobe, owned by a prominent breeder, was used to develop the modern type; today most Rocky Mountain Horses trace back to this stallion. In 1986, the Rocky Mountain Horse Association was formed and by 2005 has registered over 12,000 horses. The breed is known for its preferred [...] "chocolate" [...] coat color and flaxen mane and tail, the result of the relatively rare silver dapple gene acting on a black coat, seen in much of the population. It also exhibits a four-beat ambling gait known as the [...] "single-foot". Originally developed as a multi-purpose riding, driving and <b>light</b> <b>draft</b> horse, today it is used mainly for trail riding and working cattle.|$|E
40|$|Plowing is an art, {{and good}} plowing is {{the pride of}} every farmer. A good job of plowing is {{apparent}} even to the casual observer. A well-adjusted plow will do better work, have <b>lighter</b> <b>draft,</b> give less wear on plow parts, and will make the tractor easier to operate than a poorly set plow. Most plows are received from the factory “knocked down,” and must be set up and adjusted before being used. Variations in plowing conditions may make frequent plow adjustments necessary. Most modern tractor plows have all adjustments necessary to set the plow properly. When properly set, a plow should {{do a good job}} under usual plowing conditions. If a poor plowing job is done with a tractor plow, it is usually traceable to improper adjustment or extremely unfavorable plowing conditions. In most cases, failure to do first-class plowing results from careless adjustments or lack of knowledge as to how to set the plow. Because of the many different kinds of mounted plows, this bulletin deals principally with the “pulled” type moldboard tractor plow...|$|R

500|$|Close linebreeding {{during the}} breed's {{establishment}} and {{continued use of}} a closed studbook have contributed to a recognizable and reliably-transmitted type in the Nonius. The vast majority are black, dark bay or brown, either unmarked or modestly marked with white. Bay individuals are more common among the Nonius horses from Hortobágy National Park. The breed is also known for the heavy but proportional head with a convex profile called either a ram's head or Roman nose. The breed exhibits traits common to heavy-boned driving and <b>light</b> <b>draft</b> horses: powerful and arched high-set neck, broad and muscular back, open but powerful loin, deep and sloping hindquarters.

500|$|Beginning in the mid-1980s, {{long term}} studies were begun of the Sable Island herds, {{and by the}} mid-2000s, most horses living on the island had {{documented}} histories. In 2007, a genetic analysis of the Sable Island herd was performed. It was concluded that these horses were genetically similar to multipurpose and <b>light</b> <b>draft</b> breeds found in eastern mainland Canada, with differences probably created by natural selection and genetic drift. However, the researchers also stated that Sable Island horses had genetically [...] "diverged enough from other breeds to deserve special attention by conservation interest groups," [...] and {{that the loss of}} the Sable Island horses would be more damaging to the genetic diversity of the Canadian horse population than the loss of any other breed. Genetic erosion is a possibility within the Sable Island population, due to the small number of horses. In a study of mitochondrial DNA published in 2012, the Sable Island horse was found to be the least genetically diverse of the 24 horse populations studied, which included horse and pony breeds as well as feral populations from North America and Europe. A 2014 study by Parks Canada stated that the horses were under threat from their low numbers, excessive inbreeding and extreme weather due to global warming.|$|E
500|$|The {{horses were}} leased to gentleman farmers or {{religious}} orders for money or {{in exchange for}} a foal, and they remained the property of the king for three years. Despite poor conditions and hard work, the horses thrived in Canada, and were given nicknames that included [...] "the little iron horse" [...] and [...] "the horse of steel". Population numbers rose quickly from the early stock, with 148 horses by 1679, 218 horses by 1688, 684 by 1698, and by 1709, enough that the government limited farmers to owning two horses and a foal, with additional horses to be slaughtered, although this law was a failure in terms of enforcement. During the 1700s, the [...] "French Canadian Horse" [...] spread through what is now eastern Michigan and Illinois in the United States, and lived a generally feral existence, with many escaping human control completely. During the Expulsion of the Acadians in the mid-18th century, the English seized the livestock of the Acadians, including horses. Some of these animals were transported to Sable Island, where their descendents became the Sable Island horse. In the late 18th century, imported horses from the US and the British Isles were crossbred with existing Canadian stock. By the 19th century, they were found performing <b>light</b> <b>draft</b> work, as well as riding and driving duties. Cornelius Krieghoff, a 19th-century Canadian painter, was known for his works featuring the Canadian horse, who he usually showed in association with the French habitants, as opposed to the English settlers in the area. His paintings generally portrayed the Canadian horse in a utilitarian, workhorse role, often in winter scenes.|$|E
60|$|Lake Providence {{is a part}} of the old bed of the Mississippi, about a {{mile from}} the present channel. It is six miles long and has its outlet through Bayou Baxter, Bayou Macon, and the Tensas, Washita and Red Rivers. The last three are navigable streams at all seasons. Bayous Baxter and Macon are narrow and tortuous, and the banks are covered with dense forests {{overhanging}} the channel. They were also filled with fallen timber, the accumulation of years. The land along the Mississippi River, from Memphis down, is in all instances highest next to the river, except where the river washes the bluffs which form the boundary of the valley through which it winds. Bayou Baxter, as it reaches lower land, begins to spread out and disappears entirely in a cypress swamp before it reaches the Macon. There was about two feet of water in this swamp at the time. To get through it, even with vessels of the <b>lightest</b> <b>draft,</b> it was necessary to clear off a belt of heavy timber wide enough to make a passage way. As the trees would have to be cut close to the bottom--under water--it was an undertaking of great magnitude.|$|R
