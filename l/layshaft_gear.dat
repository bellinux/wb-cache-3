50|$|The FS5W71C {{gearboxes}} {{had different}} ratios {{to all other}} S13/S14. A key change was the <b>layshaft</b> <b>gear</b> which changed from 22/31 to 21/32, thus running the layshaft slower and at higher torque. This gearbox is considered weaker than other S13/S14 gearboxes. The front of the SR20DET gearbox with bell housing can be removed and a CA18DET bell housing fitted to allow the gearboxes to be swapped.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the layout}} of the gearbox, the {{layshaft}} is normally mounted low-down in the gearbox casing below the other shafts. The gear lever enters through the top of the casing and so it is more convenient for the sliding components of the dog clutches to be mounted on the driven shaft, rather than the layshaft. The <b>layshaft</b> <b>gear</b> cluster is thus often a simple one-piece component, typically cast iron gears running in bearings on a fixed steel shaft. The bearings may be plain phosphor bronze bushes, or for high-load applications needle rollers.|$|E
50|$|The {{main feature}} of the Britalus engine is an {{enclosed}} barrel-shaped cylinder block carrying compressor and expander pistons and rotating within a compact three-lobed stationary housing. The pistons carry rollers that follow an internal cam, causing the reciprocal motion of the pistons for compression and expansion. The rotor is statically and dynamically balanced and thereby operates with minimal vibration. A sleeve pinion gear on {{the rear of the}} rotor connects to a <b>layshaft</b> spur <b>gear</b> and provides the output shaft drive to the connected load.|$|R
5000|$|The {{synchronizer}} has {{to overcome}} {{the momentum of the}} entire input shaft and clutch disk when it is changing shaft rpm to match the new gear ratio. It can be abused by exposure to the momentum and power of the engine, which is what happens when attempts are made to select a gear without fully disengaging the clutch. This causes extra wear on the rings and sleeves, reducing their service life. When an experimenting driver tries to [...] "match the revs" [...] on a synchronized transmission and force it into gear without using the clutch, the synchronizer will make up for any discrepancy in RPM. The success in engaging the gear without clutching can deceive the driver into thinking that the RPM of the layshaft and transmission were actually exactly matched. Nevertheless, approximate rev. matching with clutching can decrease the difference in rotational speed between the <b>layshaft</b> and transmission <b>gear</b> shaft, therefore decreasing synchro wear.|$|R
50|$|De Groene Molen is {{what the}} Dutch {{describe}} as an Spinnenkop met Stelling. It is a hollow post mill with a roundhouse on a single storey base. The stage is at first floor level 4.20 m above ground level. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The buck and roof are covered in horizontal boards. The sails are common sails. They have a span of 13.10 m. The sails are carried on a wooden windshaft. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 39 cogs. This drives the wallower (19 cogs) {{at the top of}} the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft is the crown wheel (see photo of engine below). Since the last restoration the Archimedes' screw can be driven by either the Lister engine or by wind power. The crown wheel at the bottom of the upright shaft drives a layshaft which is connected by belt to a second <b>layshaft.</b> The driving <b>gear</b> on the end of this layshaft has 16 teeth; it drives a gear with 64 teeth on the axle of the Archimedes' screw, which is inclined at 19Â°. A second belt is used to drive this layshaft by the Lister engine.|$|R
