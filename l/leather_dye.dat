40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to find the dyeabilities and mordants effects of cow <b>leather</b> <b>dyed</b> with Lac powder. They were examined by changing dye concentration, dyeing temperature, bath ratio, dyeing time, and dyeing repetition. And K/S values and surface color changes were evaluated by various mordanting conditions. The optimum dyeing conditions of the cow <b>leather</b> <b>dyed</b> with Lac powder were 30 %, 40, 30 : 1,℃ 30 minutes, and 4 repetitions. The K/S values were higher in post mordant than pre mordanting condition. The surface colors of <b>dyed</b> cow <b>leathers</b> were R and RP.

50|$|Aniline leather {{is a type}} of <b>leather</b> <b>dyed</b> {{exclusively}} with soluble dyes without covering the surface with a topcoat paint or insoluble pigments. The resulting product retains the hide's natural surface with the 'grain', i.e. visible pores, scars etc. of the complete original animal's skin structure.

40|$|The {{interactions}} among polyoxyethylene ethers nonionic surfactants (C 18 POEn), C. I. Direct black 19 and gelatin were studied by spectrophotometry. Combin ing reflectance measurements, {{the effect of}} C 18 POEn and its adding order on <b>leather</b> <b>dyeing</b> kinetics and surface color were analyzed. Moreover, particle sizes in C 18 POEn solutions with C. I. Direct black 19 or gelatin were estimated by dynamic light scattering method. There were complexes formed by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic {{interactions among}} C 18 POEn, C. I. Direct black 19 and gelatin. With C 18 POEn the dyeing process was slowed down; the uniformity and shade of surface color were improved. Furthermore, C 18 POE n added together with dye can bring the best levelling effect. Particle size results suggest that C 18 POE n is prone to interact with dye, not with gelatin. All these results verify that the levelling effect of polyoxyethylene ethers nonionic surfactants depend on the interactions between surfactants and dyes. The study shall facilitate the use of advanced analytic techniques for understanding <b>leather</b> <b>dyeing</b> process...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} was aimed {{to investigate the}} influence of deliming with peracetic acid on <b>leather</b> <b>dyeing</b> kinetics. Hydrophobic C. I.  Acid Red  213 and hydrophilic C. I. Acid Red  423 dyes were used. Sorption of dye depends on hydrophobicity/hydrophility of dye and dyeing temperature. Equilibrium of process is reached faster using hydrophobic C. I.  Acid Red  213 at 45 ºC. However, both control and experimental leather fibres adsorb more hydrophilic dye C. I. Acid Red  423 and this fact {{does not depend on}} temperature. The diffusion coefficient of dye C. I.  Acid Red  423 calculated according to Weisz model is higher when <b>dyeing</b> conventional <b>leather.</b> The change of deliming method has influence on chromed <b>leather</b> <b>dyeing</b> but this influence is not significant. The adsorption ability of control leather fibres at 30 ºC and 45 ºC is higher using both dyes as compared to the dyeing the experimental one. The increase of dyeing temperature increases the adsorption ability independently on the sort of leather fibres. Such dependence of the adsorption ability on the temperature shows that hydrophobic action and van der Waals forces prevail between dye and fibres during dyeing process. The Gibbs energy changes show that adsorption of both <b>dyes</b> by <b>leather</b> fibres independently on their sort is a spontaneous process. The affinity of both <b>dyes</b> to conventional <b>leather</b> fibres is higher comparing with experimental one. The change of enthalpy is positive in all cases, and it means that the driving force of the dyeing is the change of entropy. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R

It {{may be due to}} utilization of cholesterol in exposed fish and hindrance in metabolism. The serum cholesterol showed a decrease with an increase in the exposure time is highly significant The cholesterol was estimated by the method of Zak et al. (1954). The cholesterol reacts with ferric ions in the acid solution of ferric chloride and sulphuric acid. This reaction involved the " 3 hydroxy- 5 -ene " part of the cholesterol molecule, which is dehydrated to form cholesta- 3, 5, diene and is then oxidized by the sulphuric acid to link two molecules as biocholestra- 3, 5 diene. This obtained substance is finally sulphonated by sulphuric acid in the presence of metal ions (Fe + 3) and the red colored disulphuric acid having a high molecular extinction coefficient is formed The fresh water fishes were treated with two <b>leather</b> <b>dyes</b> as in (tables 1 & 2) the serum cholesterol shows decreasing trend on exposure to Bismarck brown and Acid leather brown at different time intervals (24 hrs, 48 hrs, 96 hrs and 1 week) and at all three concentrations.

The need to generate outside income has led to many indigenous women producing crafts communally, which has not only had economic benefits but also involved them in the political process as well.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the mortality {{of a group}} of tannery workers. METHODS: The cohort consisted of 1244 workers (870 men and 374 women) employed at a chrome tannery between 1955 and 1988. A total of 36414 person-years of follow up was calculated (369 people had died). National and regional mortalities were used to estimate the expected numbers. RESULTS: All cause mortality was {{similar to that of the}} general population. The most remarkable excess was for bladder cancer (observed 10, standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 242, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 116 to 446). An excess of colorectal cancer (observed 17, SMR 180, 95 % CI 105 to 288) was also found, based on an increased risk of both colon (SMR 166) and rectal cancer (SMR 206). No recognisable patterns emerged from the analyses by years since first employment, calendar year of hire, or lagging exposures.
