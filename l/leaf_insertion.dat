In these labeling schemes, the approach which can extract structural information between nodes and process query efficiently is more outstanding.

40|$|A {{pressure}} flow meter system was newly developed for measuring hydraulic characteristics of plant organs. In the system, the pressurized water flow through plant organs was given at a desired rate by regulating the applied pressure, and hydraulic resistance or conductance of plant organs was determined from the flow {{rate and the}} applied pressure at intervals of about 5 minutes. By applying the system, individual evaluations of hydraulic characteristics of node, internode and <b>leaf</b> <b>insertion</b> in a nodal complex were performed {{on the basis of}} an analogue circuit of hydraulic resistances, where the hydraulic resistance of the node was divided into halves at the <b>leaf</b> <b>insertion</b> point.

Inverse planning of the 3 cancer cases was performed using the XiO treatment planning system.

The treatment plans were evaluated by dose profiles, tumor control probability (TCP), and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). The 0. 5 -cm MLC leaves showed better TCPs and NTCPs than the 1. 0 -cm leaves in the 3 cancer cases, although the differences were less than 2. 5 %. For the <b>leaf</b> <b>insertion</b> percentage, the dose profile differences among the 3 levels of increments were minimal, and their differences in TCP and NTCP were extremely small (< 1. 5 %).

40|$|The {{yield of}} crop dry matter is closely {{dependent}} upon the amount of solar radiation intercepted by the crop canopy. This in turn is primarily determined {{by the amount of}} leaf area and its persistence. This study was concerned with the influence of environments, nitrogen supply and plant density in controlling apical development and leaf growth and development in barley. Three series of experiments were carried out on sequentially sown spring barley (cv. Claret) to cover the whole range of the natural variation in environmental variables. In the first series of experiments there were 4 sowing dates, 4 levels of nitrogen and plants were grown in perlite in small pots. In the second series there were 3 sowing dates, 4 levels of nitrogen and plants were grown in soil and sand compost in small pots. In the third series of experiments there were 3 plant densities, 2 levels of nitrogen and plants were grown in soil and sand compost in large tanks. A strong effect of growth media and size of pot on leaf growth was observed. The plants grown in soil had longer leaves and had more tillers than plants grown in perlite. Leaves were even longer when plants were grown in large tanks. Primordia initiation on the main shoot apex, leaf appearance and leaf extension were best described as linear function of thermal time rather than Julian time. Rate of leaf appearance on the main shoot was found to be linearly related to the rate of change of daylength at crop emergence. Final leaf length depended upon both the rate and duration of leaf extension. However, most of the variation in final leaf length was due mainly to variation in leaf extension rate. Leaf extension rate increased with nitrogen supply. A significant quadratic relationship between leaf extension rate and leaf nitrogen content was observed. It is suggested that irrespective of growing conditions leaf extension rate (in mm Â°Cd- 1) is most probably controlled by the nitrogen content in the leaf rather than external nitrogen supply. High temperatures, long days and fast leaf appearance rates all resulted in shorter leaf extension duration. Of these variables variation in temperature accounted for the greatest proportion of variation in leaf extension duration. In general all the plant parameters recorded were affected by nitrogen supply, but the effect was more pronounced in perlite. There was a smaller response to applied nitrogen in soil because of the residual nitrogen supplied by the breakdown of organic matter. Lamina area and dry weight increased with the position of leaf on the main shoot up to 2 <b>leaf</b> <b>insertions</b> before the flag leaf. The flag leaf was always much smaller than the subtending leaves. This ontogenetic drift in leaf size was associated with variations in leaf extension rate and leaf extension duration of the leaves. Final leaf size was affected by plant density. As density increased the size of the first three leaves was increased but the size of upper leaves was dramatically decreased. As density increased, final leaf number and the position of the largest leaf on the main shoot were decreased. Nitrogen affected the position of the largest leaf on the main shoot. As nitrogen supply increased the position of longest leaf moved higher up the main stem. This pattern was also modified by sowing date. In sowings made in June, where rate of crop development was fastest, leaf 4 was the first leaf to show response to nitrogen. In sowings made in September, which developed more slowly, leaf 6 was the first leaf to show response to nitrogen. These effects are attributed to effects of internal competition for nitrogen. This suggests that the size of the later leaves is reduced due to lower availability of nitrogen. Early stem extension will also result in greater competition for nitrogen. On this basis one would expect a large response to nitrogen in fast developing crops and this was the pattern observed in these experiments. For most of the leaf growth parameters recorded in these experiments there were significant sowing date * nitrogen supply * leaf position interactions, which have not been reported in previously published investigations. This indicates the complex way in which these factors control leaf growth...|$|R

Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of foliar application of copper (Cu) on the growth and yield of DG- 501 maize. The experiment was carried out between December 2009 and April 2010 in conventional tillage. When plants were with six to eight leaves, Cu (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 g ha- 1) was applied to the leaves. Treatments were arranged in randomized complete block with five replications.

At harvest, it was evaluated diameter and length of the ear, yield and thousand grain weight. There was a linear reduction in the plant height and in the height of the first ear insertion with increasing Cu doses. On the other hand, chlorophyll content, leaf area, diameter and length of ear, thousand grain weight and yield increased at doses up to 100 g ha- 1 Cu, however, decreased at higher doses.

The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with four replications, with the treatments arranged in a factorial 3 x 5, consisting of three sources (coated urea, urea and ammonium sulfate) and five doses (0, 60, 120, 180 and 240 kg ha - 1) of N, topdressing, applied in the surface and in a single dose, when the corn plants were in V 4 stage.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to examine {{different}} phyllotactic patterns and pattern transitions in seedlings of eastern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.). Four phyllotactic patterns were observed on the main stem of T. occidentalis: tetracussate, tricussate, (3, 5) spiral, and decussate. Only one phyllotactic pattern was observed on the side branches of T. occidentalis: decussate. Four types of phyllotactic pattern transition were observed: tetracussate to decussate, tetracussate to tricussate, tricussate to (3, 5) spiral, and (3, 5) spiral to decussate. For each phyllotactic pattern, the following phyllotactic parameters were examined using histological sections: divergence angle, plastochrone ratio, <b>leaf</b> <b>insertion</b> angle, parameter Ð, and apical angle of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Even though they varied widely, the phyllotactic parameters measured in T. occidentalis seem to fall within ranges observed in other plants for specific phyllotactic patterns.

In contrast to continuous transitions, where there is a good correlation between phyllotactic parameters, there was no correlation between the phyllotactic pattern (characterized by a given divergence angle) and other phyllotactic parameters in the discontinuous transitions observed in T. occidentalis...|$|E

40|$|Drought {{is a major}} {{abiotic stress}} {{affecting}} all levels of plant organization and, in particular, leaf elongation. Several experiments were designed to study the effect of water deficits on maize (Zea mays) leaves at the protein level by {{taking into account the}} reduction of leaf elongation. Proteomic analyses of growing maize leaves allowed us to show that two isoforms of caffeic acid/ 5 -hydroxyferulic 3 -O-methyltransferase (COMT) accumulated mostly at 10 to 20 cm from the <b>leaf</b> point of <b>insertion</b> and that drought resulted in a shift of this region of maximal accumulation toward basal regions. We showed that this shift was due to the combined effect of reductions in growth and in total amounts of COMT. Several other enzymes involved in lignin and/or flavonoid synthesis (caffeoyl-CoA 3 -O-methyltransferase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, and several isoforms of S-adenosyl-l-methionine synthase and methionine synthase) were highly correlated with COMT, reinforcing the hypothesis that the zone of maximal accumulation corresponds to a zone of lignification. According to the accumulation profiles of the enzymes, lignification increases in leaves of control plants when their growth decreases before reaching their final size. Lignin levels analyzed by thioacidolysis confirmed that lignin is synthesized in the region where we observed the maximal accumulation of these enzymes. Consistent with the levels of these enzymes, we found that the lignin level was lower in leaves of plants subjected to water deficit than in those of well-watered plants...|$|R

Many studies {{have been carried out}} on the penetration of radiation into crops however to date, few results are available on turfgrasses, mainly due to the difficulties of introducing sensors into the turf without disturbing the natural position of the leaves. In the present research two warm season turfgrasses, hybrid bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon Ã transvaalensis) 'Patriot' and manilagrass (Zoysia matrella) 'Zeon', were studied. The aim was to describe their canopy architecture grown with minimal disturbance to the natural arrangement of the leaves and stems, and to determine the potential effects of canopy architecture on light penetration and reflectance. Radiometric measurements were carried out at eight different profile levels of turfgrasses that were up to 12 cm tall. A LI-COR 1800 spectroradiometer with an optical fiber cable and a 7 mm diameter sensor was used. Measurements were carried out in the 390 - 1100 nm region at 5 nm intervals. The LAI value was higher for the manilagrass (9. 0) than for the hybrid bermudagrass (5. 6). The transmitted radiation was found to be closely dependent on downward cumulative LAI.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were carried out in solution culture in growt ooms and a glasshouse, to {{study the effects of}} sallnlty on leaf extension rate ion concentrations, sap osmotic pressure, net photosynthesis and related parameters, stom tal frequency, specific leaf weight and a number of agronomlc parameters of spring wheat. Rate of net photosynthesis, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance and sub-stomatal carbon dioxide concentration per unit area of leaf were determined using an Infra-red Gas Analyser. Experiments 1 and 3 were conducted in growth rooms set at a temperature cycle of 24 Â°Cj 16 Â°C day and night and photoperiod of 16 hours. The seedlings received light from a bank of 125 W fluorescent 'warm white' lights which provided between 200 - 300 mol m- 2 s-l photosynthetically active radiation at initial plant level. Experiments 2, 4 and 5 were carried out in a glasshouse with no control of light and temperature. In Experiment 1 the salinity treatments tested were control (0 mol m- 3 NaCI), 'constant' and 'variable' salinity. In the constant salinity treatment plants were grown at 100 mol m- 3 NaCI all the time after initial salt stress. In the variable salinity treatment a 12 day cycle was repeated with daily increments of 10 mol m- 3 NaCI after initial salt stress of 50 mol m- 3 NaCI till it reached to 150 mol m- 3 NaCI. During the final two days of the cycle salinity was stepped down from 150 to 100 to 50 mol m- 3 NaCl. In Experiment 2 the salinity levels tested were 0, 50, 100 and 150 mol m- 3 NaCI. CaCI was added in this and later experiments at 20 : 1 (mol Na :mol ca 2 +) ratio. The results of the both Experiments 1 and 2 suggested that salinity had no effect on leaf appearance stage but tiller production was decreased. Salinity decreased leaf extension rate and final leaf length but leaf extension duration was not affected. Although leaf extension rate was the main factor influencing final leaf length, there were no consistent quantitative relationships between these parameters in different leaves and at different salinity levels. Plants in variable salinity performed better than those in constant salinity but these treatments were not significantly different and gave similar results. The results of Experiment 2 showed that a gradient of Na+ and Cl- concentrations was found in different leaves. Higher Na+ and Cl- concentrations were found in lower leaves than in expanding leaves. Calculated Na+ and CI- contents (ion concentrations x dry weight) suggested that these ions were mainly located in roots, stem and tillers irrespective of salinity levels. The effect of salinity was to increase concentrations of leaf Na+, Cl- and sap osmotic pressure in the youngest fully expanded leaves whereas K+ concentration was inconsistently affected. When gas exchange measurements were made in situ on leaves, light intensity showed wide i variation due to movement of clouds. Variations in light intensity and absence of any equilibration prior to measurements made it difficult to detect any effects of salinity on gas exchange. Therefore {{to determine the effects of}} salinity on gas exchange in expanding and senescing leaves, in Experiments 3, 4 and 5, a strong light source capable of providing photon flux densities at or near light saturation for gas exchange was used. In Experiments 3 and 4 light response curves were produced using neutral density filters. Using an exponential model, maximum net photosynthesis photosynthetic efficiency, photon flux compensation point and dark respiration for salinities and <b>leaf</b> <b>insertions</b> were calculated. In Exper ent 3 the. s linity levels tested were 0, 100 and 200 mol m NaCI. Sa 11 n 1 ty decreased green lamina area, maximum and net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, leaf productivity but increased dark respiration and photon flux compensation point. Photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration efficiency were inconsistently affected. In Experiment 3 at 200 mol m- 3 NaCI leaf 6 senesced rapidly. Therefore in Experiment 4 the salinity levels tested were 0, 75 and 150 mol m- 3 NaCI. In Experiment 4 the parameters studied were identical to those in Experiment 3 except that the measurements were performed on leaf 5 and the flag leaf. In Experiment 4 a similar trend for gas exchange parameters was noted at 0 and 150 mol m- 3 NaCl but at 75 mol m- 3 NaCI Pn was higher than in the control due to delayed senescence. In both Experiments 3 and 4 leaf sap Na+, CI- and osmotic pressure increased and Pn decreased during senescence but there were no consistent relationships between these parameters for different leaves and salinity treatments. Experiments 2, 3 and 4 suggested that salinity increased stomatal frequency per unit leaf area but stomatal frequency per leaf and specific leaf weight were inconsistently affected. Experiment 5 was conducted to examine the effects of salinity on changes in gas exchange in the flag leaf and two penultimate leaves simultaneously. The salinity levels tested were 0, 75 and 150 mol m- 3 NaCI. The leaf x salinity interaction showed that salinity had larger effects on the flag leaf than leaves 2 and 3. The leaf x salinity interaction was significant for leaf temperature, net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and transpiration efficiency but not for sUb-stomatal carbon dioxide concentration. Salinity significantly decreased all the yield components and grain yield. The results of these experiments suggest that salinity had large effects on photosynthesis, dry matter production and grain yield and that ion concentrations do not determine the observed changes in net photosynthesis with leaf age in salt stressed plants...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{wild cherry}} (Prunus avium) has great and {{multiple}} importance. The fruits it produces {{are used for}} several purposes (as food for people, birds and other animals, {{as well as in}} phytotherapy). As many birds and mammals feed on the fruit of the wild cherry, it has the ability of dispersion over large areas in a very short time. It is present in from river deposits up to 1900 m/alt, while it is quite rare in the Submediterranean. Wild cherry grows as a solitary tree or in small groups, usually {{at the edge of the}} forest or within the forest in areas with more sunlight. The significance of the wild cherry is reflected in the high conomic value of its wood, which makes itmuch demanded and popular, and thus endangered. Materials and Methods: The plant material was collected from 22 natural populations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The fruit and leaves were collected from marginal or solitary trees, usually from the south-facing,outer sun-exposed parts of the tree crown. We measured the following fruit characteristics: fruit length (FL), fruit width (FW), fruit thickness (FT), seed length (SL), seed width (SW), seed thickness (ST), length of the stalk (LOS) and width of the stalk (WOS), and leaf characteristics: length of the petiole (LP), length of the leaf blade (LB), distance from the blade base to the bladeâs widest part (BBW), width of the <b>leaf</b> blade (WB), <b>insertion</b> angle of the leaf venation (AV), number of leaf teeth on a 2 -cm length (NT), blade width at 1 cmfrom the blade apex (WBA) and blade width at 1 cm from the bladeâs base (WBB). All statistical analyses of the data were made using the SPSS 15. 0 package for Windows. Results: The results obtained show the presence of a high level of intrapopulational, as well as interpopulational, morphological variability in the natural populations of the wild cherry which have been investigated. Analyses of population differentiation have not confirmed our expectations. Our results only indicate differentiation in fruit size characteristics, but the indicators are very weak. The resulting high values of the regression coefficient in this research can serve to estimate the values of some features and characteristics without their measurement. Conclusions: The analyses of 16 morphological characteristics in 22 natural populations of the wild cherry in Bosnia and Herzegovina showed statistically significant differences between investigated populations.

40|$|Although silicon is not {{recognized}} as a nutrient, it may benefit rice plants and may alleviate the Mn toxicity in some plant species. The dry matter yield (root, leaf, sheaths and leaf blade) and plant architecture (angle of <b>leaf</b> <b>insertion</b> and leaf arc) were evaluated in rice plants grown in nutrient solutions with three Mn doses, with and without Si addition. The treatments were arranged in a 2 x 3 factorial [with and without (2 mmol L- 1) Si; three Mn doses (0. 5; 2. 5 and 10 Âµmol L- 1) ], in a randomized block design with 4 replications. The experimental unit was a 4 L plastic vase with 4 rice (Metica- 1 cultivar) plants. Thirty nine days after keeping the seedlings in the nutrient solution the plant dry matter yield was determined; the angle of <b>leaf</b> <b>insertion</b> in the sheath and the leaf arc were measured; and the Si and Mn concentrations in roots, sheaths and leaves were determined. The analysis of variance (F test at 5 and 1 % levels) and the regression analysis (for testing plant response to Mn with the Si treatments) were performed. The Si added to the nutrient solution increased the dry matter yield of roots, sheaths and leaf blades and also decreased the angle of leaf blade insertion into the sheath and the foliar arc in the rice plant. Additionally, it ameliorated the rice plant architecture which allowed {{an increase in the}} dry matter yield. Similarly, the addition of Mn to the solution improved the architecture of the rice plants with gain in dry matter yield. As Si was added to the nutrient solution, the concentration of Mn in leaves decreased and in roots increased thus alleviating the toxic effects of Mn on the plants...|$|E

40|$|Herbage digestibility, {{which to}} a large extent governs the animal's intake, is not easily {{predicted}} for grazing animals, and can vary due to different grazing managements. The objective {{of this study was to}} build a model for a range of defoliation managements, which takes account of vegetative grass tiller structure, rather than dates of cutting or grazing, as done usually. An experiment was conducted in 1997, near Toulouse, to examine the digestibility of cocksfoot whole lamina and lamina segments (15 cm) for three defoliation regimes. These regimes mimicked severe and lenient intermittent defoliations plus a frequent defoliation treatment over a six-week period. Data were collected for (i) lamina mass and digestibility for the youngest expanded lamina, (ii) lamina appearance rate, lamina and sheath lengths. Laminae digestibility, measured over time, varied greatly with the defoliation regime both for the youngest full expanded lamina and all laminae on a tiller. Digestibility of the youngest fully expanded lamina decreased from one <b>leaf</b> <b>insertion</b> level to the next, but this decrease was lowest when the defoliation regime was frequent. There was also a consistent decrease in the digestibility of a lamina from its tip to its base. Sheath and lamina lengths varied with treatment in a different way to lamina digestibility. During frequent defoliation, sheath and lamina lengths both increased slightly while they showed substantial increases in the two other treatments. Lamina length increased from one insertion level to the next, and resulted in the addition of less digestible lamina segments rather than reducing overall lamina digestibility. Sheath length, through its influence on leaf appearance rate and lamina length, could be used to predict the digestibility of laminae over time according to <b>leaf</b> <b>insertion</b> level and the difference in the digestibility observed from the tip to the base of a particular lamina. Sheath length could therefore provide a basis for predicting the time course of grass digestibility for different combinations of defoliation frequency and height...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the biomass production, plant architecture and Si and Mn uptake in rice plants cultivated in a Acrustox fertilized with silicon and manganese. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse using a 2 x 5 factorial (0 and 1000 mg dm- 3 Si x 0, 4, 12, 16 and 20 mg dm- 3 Mn) with four replications, in a randomized block design. The application of Si to the soil resulted in a smaller <b>leaf</b> <b>insertion</b> angle, a greater Si content in the leaves and roots and biomass production. Moreover, Si caused the decrease content of Mn in leaves and its increase in roots. With the rising dose of Mn, there was an increase in the content of this element in soil, roots and leaves, regardless of the Si application and reduction in biomass production of rice in the larger doses only when the Si was not added to the soil...|$|E
40|$|Prominent {{applications}} of sentiment analysis are countless, covering {{areas such as}} marketing, customer service and communication. The conventional bag-of-words approach for measuring sentiment merely counts term frequencies; however, it neglects {{the position of the}} terms within the discourse. As a remedy, we develop a discourse-aware method that builds upon the discourse structure of documents. For this purpose, we utilize rhetorical structure theory to label (sub-) clauses according to their hierarchical relationships and then assign polarity scores to individual leaves. To learn from the resulting rhetorical structure, we propose a tensor-based, tree-structured deep neural network (named Discourse-LSTM) in order to process the complete discourse tree. The underlying attention mechanism infers the salient passages of narrative materials. In addition, we suggest two algorithms for data augmentation (node reordering and artificial <b>leaf</b> <b>insertion)</b> that increase our training set and reduce overfitting. Our benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. Moreover, the attention mechanism reveals the salient text passages and thereby provides explanatory insights...|$|E
30|$|Bakanae {{is caused}} {{by one or more}} seed-borne Fusarium species, mainly F. fujikuroi (Wulff et al. 2010), and the disease may infect rice plants from the pre-emergence stage to the mature stage, with severe {{infection}} of rice seeds resulting in poor germination or withering (Iqbal et al. 2011). F. fujikuroi belongs to hemibiotrophs fungi, whose initial infection relies on a living host (biotrophic), and progressive infection involves a consumption and destruction of the host cells (necrotroph; Ma et al. 2013). Seeds contaminated with the fungus provide initial foci for primary infection. Under favorable environmental conditions, infected plants have the capacity to produce numerous conidia that subsequently infect proximate healthy panicles through aerial conidial diffusion by wind, producing infected seeds (Ou 1985; Ora et al. 2011; Matic et al. 2017). During primary infection, mature rice plants are tall, frequently stunted, with an angle of <b>leaf</b> <b>insertion</b> wider than in healthy seedlings. Moreover, infected plants eventually die, while panicles on surviving plants do not develop any grains, thus resulting in yield loss (Desjardins et al. 2000; Mew and Gonzales 2002; Ou 1985).|$|E
40|$|Brevianthus is a {{distinctive}} genus of leafy liverwort in its succubously inserted, entire leaves, lack of underleaves, restriction of sexual organs to lateral-intercalary branches, scattered rhizoids and dense leaf-surface ornamentation. The sole species, Brevianthus flavus, {{is divided into}} two subspecies, one in Tasmania the other in New Zealand. A second species, Brevianthus hypocanthidium, is described as new and is the first record of the genus for New Caledonia. Among its distinguishing characters are its shallowly bilobed leaves, and triangular underleaves present on small to medium-sized shoot sectors, the lack of a hyaline leaf margin, and the crenulate leaf margin formed by heavily thickened external cell walls. The most unusual features of the new species are the presence of underleaves between lateral <b>leaf</b> <b>insertion</b> lines that reach the ventral stem mid-line, and the absence of underleaves from larger shoots. To explain these features we propose a competitive model of shoot formation wherein the ventral merophyte progressively loses vigor as its relative stature decreases, and its derivative cells become discontinuous and isolated along the ventral stem surface, with intervening areas occupied by derivatives of the more vigorous lateral merophytes...|$|E
40|$|Spot bloth {{caused by}} Bipolaris sorokiniana is an {{important}} wheat desease mainly in hot and humid regions. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the response of wheat to different sources and modes of Si application, as related to the severity of wheat spot blotch and plant growth, in two Si-deficient Latosols (Oxisols). An greenhouse experiment was arranged in a 2 x 5 factorial completely randomized design, with eight replications. The treatments consisted of two soils (Yellow Latosol and Red Latosol) and five Si supply modes (no Si application; Si applied as calcium silicate and monosilicic acid to the soil; and Si applied as potassium silicate or monosilicic acid to wheat leaves). No significant differences were observed between the two soils. When Si was applied to the soil, regardless the Si source, the disease incubation period, the shoot dry matter yield and the Si content in leaves were greater. Additionally, the final spot blotch severity was lower and the area under the spot blotch disease progress curve and the <b>leaf</b> <b>insertion</b> angle in the plant were smaller. Results of Si foliar application were similar to those observed in the control plants...|$|E
40|$|Author for {{correspondence}} New synonym in Anastrophyllum nigrescens Anastrophyllum paramicola {{was described}} by Schuster (2002 a) as being remotely allied to Anastrophyllum donnianum (Hooker 1813 : 39) Stephani (1893 : 140) and Anastrophyllum assimile (Mitten 1860 : 93) Stephani (1893 : 140). However, Schuster did not at all mention the relatively common Anastrophyllum nigrescens and the description match that species well. New synonyms in Anastrophyllum auritum Anastrophyllum auritum is a very variable species, which has resulted complicates its taxonomy. The problem is insufficient knowledge of the extreme variability in the branching patterns, size of plants, <b>leaf</b> <b>insertion</b> etc., which also has influenced the infrageneric (especially sectional) classification of the genus Anastrophyllum (Spruce 1876 : 235) Stephani (1893 : 139) proposed by Schuster (1969, 2002 a). Some populations of this species from localities with extreme severe conditions (most of subantarctic populations, including the type of Anastrophyllum auritum from Table Mt., populations from highest elevations in Andes etc.) are very small plants with mostly only terminal branches, sometimes also with ventral-lateral branching producing stolons, pectinately arranged leaves, small (reduced to small teeth or slime papilla) or missing appendages, dorsal part of leaves extended only slightly or not across the stem and nearly not decurrent dorsal leaf bases. However, optimally developed plants of Anastrophyllum auritum, relatively common in high mountains of tropica...|$|E

The garlic Germplasm Collection {{maintained}} by Embrapa HortaliÃ§as comprises 89 accessions, representing the genetic diversity of this crop in the country. Duplicates {{of the same}} genotype increase the cost of maintaining the collection, as well as make difficult their agronomic evaluation. The identification of duplicated accessions of the garlic Germoplasm Active Bank was obtained through analysis of 27 variables of morphological characteristics. Genotypic differentiation among thirteen groups was achieved by cluster analysis. The most important features for distinction of these groups through principal components analysis were: plant height with erect leaves at 60 days; plant height with normal leaves at 60 days; <b>leaf</b> <b>insertion</b> angle at 90 days; bulb colour; number of bulblets from sieves one, two, and four; weight of bulblets from sieve two; average weight of bulbs at harvest time; and average bulb weight at threshing time.

40|$|The {{developing}} leaf {{three of}} barley {{provides an excellent}} model system for the direct determination of relationships between amounts of waxes and cutin and cuticular permeance. Permeance of the cuticle was assessed via the time-course of uptake of either toluidine blue or 14 C-labelled benzoic acid ([14 C] BA) {{along the length of}} the developing leaf. Toluidine blue uptake only occurred within the region 0 â 25 mm from the point of <b>leaf</b> <b>insertion</b> (POLI). Resistanceâthe inverse of permeanceâto uptake of [14 C] BA was determined for four leaf regions and was lowest in the region 10 â 20 mm above POLI.

Above the point of emergence of leaf three from the sheath of leaf two, which was 76 â 80 mm above POLI, resistance was as high as at 50 â 60 mm above POLI. GC-FID/MS analyses of wax and cutin showed that: (1) the initial seven fold increase in cuticular resistance coincided with increase in cutin coverage and appearance of waxes; (2) the second, larger and final increase in cuticle resistance was accompanied by an increase in wax coverage, whereas cutin coverage remained unchanged; (3) cutin deposition in barley leaf epidermis occurred in parallel with cell elongation, whereas deposition of significant amounts of wax commenced as cells ceased to elongate...|$|E
