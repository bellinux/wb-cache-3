The Marathon, which chronicles Abebe's two Olympic victories, ends with a dedication ceremony for a gymnasium named in Abebe's honour shortly before his death.|$|E

Crowley said the work he had received was deeper, showing in more detail the technique people should practice, and revealing scientific mysteries. He said that Rabelais confines himself to portraying an ideal, rather than addressing questions of political economy and similar subjects, which must be solved in order to realize the Law.|$|E

5|$|Benchley {{started at}} the Tribune as a reporter.

He wrote two articles a week: the first a review of non-literary books, the other a feature-style article about whatever he wanted. The liberty gave his work new <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> success of his pieces in the magazine convinced his editors to give him a signed byline column in the Tribune proper.|$|E
5|$|Central to the {{structure}} and plot {{of the show is}} the use of electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the police—hence the title The Wire.

Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> characters' need to sift through this information.|$|E
5|$|During Watts's lifetime, European culture {{had begun}} to {{question}} the concept of hope.

The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless.|$|E

5|$|Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic is a 2006 graphic memoir by the American {{cartoonist}} Alison Bechdel, {{author of}} the comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For.

The book addresses themes of sexual orientation, gender roles, suicide, emotional abuse, dysfunctional family <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> role of literature in understanding oneself and one's family. Writing and illustrating Fun Home took seven years, {{in part because of}} Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure.|$|E
5|$|Geologists have {{classified}} the volcano's {{lava flows}} into two units. The Hawi Volcanic layers were {{deposited in the}} shield stage of the volcano's <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> younger Pololu Volcanics were deposited in the volcano's post-shield stage. The rock in the younger Hawi section, which overlies the older Pololu flows, is mostly 260,000 to 140,000 years old, and composed mainly of hawaiite and trachyte. The separation between the two layers is not clear; the lowest layers may actually be in the Pololu section, based on their depositional patterns and low phosphorus content. The time intervals separating the two periods of volcanic evolution were extremely brief, something first noted in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Her {{most infamous}} antic was giving Ozy a haircut only to accidentally shave off all his fur. Although she is {{normally}} manic, {{she also has}} a strong sense of justice, facing the inexplicable wrongs of <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> world she sees. However, her rebellions are mostly limited to annoying her mother, playing jokes on Ozy and disrupting the peace at school. None of which matters any less to her, as long as she has fun doing it. Millie says aloud what others think, and does what others, for fear of reaction from the people around them, would not dare. She, like Ozy, often tries to answer the most important questions in life, but her method of finding the answers makes her unique.|$|E
