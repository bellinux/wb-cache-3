5|$|Several rock types {{with varying}} {{chemical}} compositions make up Level Mountain. Ankaramites and alkali basalts {{are the primary}} volcanic rocks comprising the basal shield. Alkali basalts form columnar jointed <b>lava</b> <b>flows,</b> vesicular <b>lava</b> <b>flows,</b> dikes and scoria while ankaramites are present as dark-coloured <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> with several columnar cooling units. Trachybasalts, phonolites, trachytes, peralkaline trachytes, pantellerites, comendites and rhyolites form the overlying stratovolcano and domes. They comprise dikes, welded tuffs, pitchstones, volcanic plugs, laccoliths and flows. Trachybasalts are {{in the form of}} two textural types; phenocryst-rich <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> and fragmental flow agglomerates. Phonolites are vesicular and pumiceous in nature, although phonolites with trachytic texture are also present. Trachytes and peralkaline trachytes are the primary volcanic rocks in the Level Mountain Range. Comendite <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> appear to have erupted fluidly, forming lava tubes. Rhyolites are in the form of stubby <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> and domes.|$|E
5|$|Holocene <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> {{are more}} alkalic than the Pleistocene <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> and {{comprise}} several xenoliths of chromium-spinel lherzolite, spinel clinopyroxenite, and rare ferroan websterite and spinel wehrlite. Xenoliths {{do not exist}} in the older <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> However, chemical evidence indicates that every lava flow was produced in a similar way by low degrees of piecemeal melting. The melts originally came from the upper mantle which, over time, was progressively depleted by every following melting event.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lava</b> <b>flows</b> {{are rare}} in Japan—the high silica {{content of the}} magmas there mean that {{explosive}} eruptions are far more common—but the <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> at Sakurajima continued for months.|$|E

50|$|Mount Garibaldi in the Pacific Range {{was last}} active about 10,700 to 9,300 {{years ago from}} a cinder cone called Opal Cone.

5|$|Kristen LaMoreaux, {{another student}} of the University of Pittsburgh, focused on the {{emplacement}} of trachyte <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> and domes. In 2006, LaMoreaux analyzed jointing patterns at Ornostay Bluff, a viscous series of trachyte <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> on the western lava plateau of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. LaMoreaux also examined trachytic <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> from Koosick Bluff and Triangle Dome, a trachytic lava dome which last erupted during the Pleistocene period. Other studies by LaMoreaux determined criteria for understanding how lava flow thickness {{may or may not}} be an indication that the progress of a lava flow was impeded by an ice barrier, resulting in an unusually thick lava flow.|$|E
5|$|Geological {{mapping of}} the volcano has {{indicated}} {{that as much as}} 80% {{of the volcano}}'s surface has been topped by <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> during the last 5,000years, entirely composed of shield alkalic basalt. More than half of this is under 3,000years old, and about 12% is less than 1,000years of age. Between the years 1700 and 2016, eruptions originated from six vents; four of these <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> poured into the sea to the west coast.|$|E
5|$|The last {{eruption}} of Mauna Kea was about 4,600 years ago (about 2600 BCE); {{because of this}} inactivity, Mauna Kea is assigned a United States Geological Survey hazard listing of 7 for its summit and 8 for its lower flanks, out of the lowest possible hazard rating of 9 (which {{is given to the}} extinct volcano Kohala). Twenty percent of the volcano's summit has seen <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> in the past 10,000 years, and its flanks have seen virtually no <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> during that time.|$|E

50|$|Mesa de Maya {{originated}} from a balsaltic <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> 180 million years ago. Originating in Colorado {{at a place}} named Piney Mountain, the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> measures 55 miles long, from one-half (1 km) to 8 mi wide, and 600 ft thick. The uneroded portion of the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> consists today of the Mesa de Maya and Black Mesa.|$|R
5|$|Amazonian period (named after Amazonis Planitia): between 3.3 and 2.9 {{billion years}} ago to the present. Amazonian regions have few {{meteorite}} impact craters, but are otherwise quite varied. Olympus Mons formed during this period, with <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> elsewhere on Mars.|$|E
5|$|During the mafic capping stage, basanite, alkali olivine basalt and hawaiite erupted {{mainly from}} small {{parasitic}} cones, tuff rings and fissures {{in the eastern}} half of the shield. Eruptions occurred subglacially, subaqueously and/or subaerially as shown by a wide range in the degree of vesicularity, freshness and glass content of the lavas. In most cases, each parasitic cone produced three or four <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> from breaches in the cone walls. These were erupted as pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, but the tops of the <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> are commonly missing due to erosion. Hawaiite was the most extensively erupted lava of the mafic capping stage, occurring mostly {{at the southern end of}} the Itcha Range but also in its interior.|$|E
5|$|Edziza's shield volcanoes {{are built}} {{almost entirely of}} fluid <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> They formed {{as a result of}} lava flowing out in all {{directions}} from central summit vents and from groups of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> of highly fluid basaltic lava, which spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. In some shield volcano eruptions, basaltic lava has poured out quietly from fissure vents instead of central vents, flooding the surrounding countryside with lava flow upon lava flow, forming Edziza's broad lava plateau.|$|E
2500|$|The final {{event of}} the {{eruption}} was the extrusion of a small thick glassy dacite <b>lava</b> <b>flow.</b> Although it has been heavily overgrown by vegetation, its original form is still well preserved. This <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> was poor in volcanic gas, indicating that minor or no explosivity occurred when it was erupted. It is [...] long and varies in thickness from [...] to [...] The southern margin of the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> cooled into well preserved columnar joints. Subsequent erosion of the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> by Fall Creek has created a waterfall.|$|R
5000|$|The Lost Jim <b>Lava</b> <b>Flow,</b> {{located in}} the heart of the Seward Peninsula in Alaska, is a Holocene <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> in the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve.

5|$|Haulālai is a known {{source for}} xenoliths, {{rock from the}} Earth's mantle that have been brought up in <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> Many prehistoric deposits, {{as well as those}} from the 1801 event, contain xenoliths of large size and {{abundant}} quantity.|$|E
5|$|Lastarria {{is located}} on a {{basement}} formed by andesite–dacite volcanic rocks {{in the form of}} ignimbrites, <b>lava</b> <b>flows,</b> and lava domes. They are of Miocene to Pleistocene age.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of some <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is unusual because they include small, angular to rounded fragments of rock called nodules and crystals {{that come from}} the mantle. These green nodules are known as peridotites because they are mostly made of a magnesium iron silicate mineral called olivine. These <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> also comprise large crystals of olivine, plagioclase, and pyroxene that crystallized deep within the Earth's crust and mantle. The lavas and nodules they contain {{are similar to those}} erupted at Volcano Mountain in the Yukon. The nodules help volcanologists and other geoscientists to verify what the mantle beneath the volcanic field is like.|$|E
40|$|The 2014 – 2015 Holuhraun {{eruption}} was {{the largest}} fissure eruption in Iceland in the last 200 years. This flood basalt eruption produced ~[*] 1. 6 km 3 of lava, forming a <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> field covering an area of ~[*] 84 km 2. Over the 6 -month course of the eruption, ~[*] 11 Mt of SO 2 were released from the eruptive vents {{as well as from}} the cooling <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> field. This work examines the post-eruption SO 2 flux emitted by the Holuhraun <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> field, providing the first study of the extent and relative importance of the outgassing of a <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> field after emplacement. We use data from a scanning differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) instrument installed at the eruption site to monitor the flux of SO 2. In this study, we propose a new method to estimate the SO 2 emissions from the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> field, based on the characteristic shape of the scanned column density distribution of a homogenous source close to the ground. Post-eruption outgassing of the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> field continued for at least 3 months after the end of the eruption, with SO 2 flux between <[*] 1 and 9 kg/s. The <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> field post-eruption emissions were not a significant contributor to the total SO 2 released during the eruption; however, the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> field was still an important polluter and caused high concentrations of SO 2 at ground level after lava effusion ceased...|$|R

50|$|A {{lava tube}} {{is a natural}} conduit formed by <b>flowing</b> <b>lava</b> which moves beneath the {{hardened}} surface of a <b>lava</b> <b>flow.</b> Tubes can be draining lava from a volcano during an eruption, or can be extinct, meaning the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> has ceased and the rock has cooled and left a long cave.|$|R
5|$|The felsic shield-building stage {{began with}} the {{eruption}} of phonolite, trachyte, phonolitic trachyte, quartz-trachyte and rhyolite lava. Subsequent volcanism of the pre-explosive phase produced a basal sequence of aphyric trachyte <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> and domes with minor altered flow-banded rhyolite, sulfide-bearing rhyolitic tuffs and a few thin hawaiite <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> This activity was concentrated at {{the summit of the}} volcano as shown by the increasing thickness of volcanic material towards the summit. A hydrothermally altered aphyric trachyte dike, which forms a narrow ridge linking Mount Downton and Itcha Mountain, might have been the source for these eruptions.|$|E
5|$|The {{gravitational}} {{field of the}} Moon has been measured through tracking the Doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft. The main lunar gravity features are mascons, large positive gravitational anomalies associated {{with some of the}} giant impact basins, partly caused by the dense mare basaltic <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> that fill those basins. The anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the Moon. There are some puzzles: <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> by themselves cannot explain all of the gravitational signature, and some mascons exist that are not linked to mare volcanism.|$|E
5|$|The volcano has two {{fields of}} fumaroles (<) {{in the area}} between Uturunku's two summits and has caused {{hydrothermal}} alteration of country rock. These fumaroles form visible clouds of steam. This heat may have been replenished from the APVC melt generating zone or survived since the last eruption of the volcano. Fumarolic activity is distinct enough to be visible from ASTER satellite image but barely visible from the ground. The temperature of the hotspot has been relatively constant in contrast to Lascar. The presence of <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> overlying moraines, which indicate post-glacial activity, is controversial; the summit <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> have been glaciated.|$|E
500|$|Eruptions near Ray Lake built a {{cinder cone}} known as Dragon Cone and {{concluded}} with an approximately [...] long aā <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> {{that has been}} radiocarbon dated at about 7,600 years old. This <b>lava</b> <b>flow,</b> known as [...] "Dragon's Tongue", is at least [...] thick at the proximal end, but thins to [...] at the distal end, damming {{the southern end of}} Clearwater Lake. Tree molds are maintained within the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> at the lower end.|$|R
50|$|Hoyada volcano is {{a crater}} with a {{diameter}} of 450 m. It is surrounded by tephra falls and forms a 2.5 km long <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> which after 1.5 km splits into two branches. The presence of levees in the flow indicates that the flow rate diminished during the eruption. Lagunitas volcano conversely is a 150 m high stratovolcano-like cone that generated a blocky <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> 2.2 km long. This <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> also dammed an ephemeral stream, creating a lake. The Loma Negra cone is older than the Lagunitas one considering that the Lagunitas <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> is deflected by the Loma Negra cone and lava. The Loma Negra cone formed a <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> 1.7 km long. A phreatic explosion at its margins formed the Nina Encantada lake. Hoyo Colorado is a cone which generated a complex lava field damming the Salado river. Hoyo Colorado has erupted approximately twice as much rock as the other three centres.|$|R
50|$|Mount St John is {{now known}} {{to be the source}} of the long <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> that ran west down an old stream valley and out into the Waitemata Harbour as Meola Reef. Maungawhau / Mount Eden later erupted through the <b>lava</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|R
5|$|This {{eruption}} style {{can take}} the form of either <b>lava</b> <b>flows,</b> spreading across the floor of the paterae, or lava lakes. Except for observations by Galileo during its seven close flybys, {{it can be difficult to}} tell the difference between a lava lake and a lava flow eruption on a patera floor, due to inadequate resolution and similar thermal emission characteristics. Intra-patera lava flow eruptions, such as the Gish Bar Patera eruption in 2001, can be just as voluminous as those seen spreading out across the Ionian plains. Flow-like features have also been observed within a number of paterae, like Camaxtli Patera, suggesting that <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> periodically resurface their floors.|$|E
5|$|Blocky (dotted {{with flat}} blocks of {{minerals}} and crystals) <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> stream from its summit to its flanks. Three historical eruptions {{have taken place}} – two within the 18th century, the first from 1700–1710, and the latter in 1796. The earliest prehistoric eruption was believed {{to have taken place}} between 3050 and 2050BCE.|$|E
5|$|Flow-dominated eruptions are {{long-lived}} {{events that}} build up extensive, compound <b>lava</b> <b>flows.</b> The extent of these flows makes them a major terrain type on Io. In {{this style of}} eruption, magma emerges onto the surface from vents {{on the floor of}} paterae, vents surrounding paterae, or from fissures on the plains, producing inflated, compound <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> similar to those seen at Kīlauea in Hawaii. Images from the Galileo spacecraft revealed that many of Io's major flows, like those at Prometheus and Amirani, are produced by the build-up of small breakouts of lava on top of older flows. Flow-dominated eruptions differ from explosion-dominated eruptions by their longevity and their lower energy output per unit of time. Lava erupts at a generally steady rate, and flow-dominated eruptions can last for years or decades.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lava</b> <b>flowed</b> over 40 sq mi of {{countryside}} {{to the sea}} and also destroyed another village Salago. The depth of the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> in some parts was 400 feet. A Catholic church and a meetinghouse of the LDS Church were also buried.|$|R
25|$|A <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> is {{a moving}} outpouring of lava created during a non-explosive effusive eruption. When it has stopped moving, lava solidifies to form igneous rock. The term <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> is {{commonly}} shortened to lava. Although lava can {{be up to}} 100,000 times more viscous than water, <b>lava</b> can <b>flow</b> great distances before cooling and solidifying because of its thixotropic and shear thinning properties.|$|R
50|$|Wargentin is {{an unusual}} lunar impact crater which has been filled to its rim by a basaltic <b>lava</b> <b>flow,</b> forming a raised plateau. When the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> occurred, it erupted from within the crater walls and {{proceeded}} to accumulate until overrunning the lowest portion of the rim. Some blockage then prevented the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> from returning to equilibrium. Since the time when this occurred, some ejecta has been deposited across the top, giving the surface a higher albedo than is typical for deposits of basalt.|$|R
