40|$|Anthropogenic {{climate change}} is causing {{a wide range of}} {{stresses}} in aquatic ecosystems, primarily through warming thermal conditions. Lakes, in response to these changes, are experiencing increases in both summer temperatures and ice-free days. We used continuous records of <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> and air temperature to create statistical models of daily mean <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> to assess thermal changes in mountain lakes. These models were combined with downscaled climate projections to predict future thermal conditions for 27 high-elevation lakes in the southern Rocky Mountains. The models predict a 0. 25 °C·decade- 1 increase in mean annual <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> through the 2080 s, which is greater than warming rates of streams in this region. Most striking is that on average, ice-free days are predicted to increase by 5. 9 days ·decade- 1, and summer mean <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> is predicted to increase by 0. 47 °C·decade- 1. Both could profoundly alter the length of the growing season and potentially change the structure and function of mountain lake ecosystems.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a procedure}} that was developed to delineate potential fishing grounds in Lake Malawi using data on chlorophyll-a concentration derived from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/AQUA) in combination with <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> (LST) data obtained from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and MODIS/Terra satellite sensors. The paper draws from findings of studies [1, 2] on development of algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-a and <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> in Lake Malawi from satellite imagery, respectively. To estimate chlorophyll concentration (a proxy for phytoplankton) in Lake Malawi using data from MODIS satellite imagery, in situ measurements of chlorophyll concentration were conducted at three selected sampling stations over the southeastern arm of Lake Malawi concurrent with satellite image acquisitions. These were regressed on chlorophyll-a concentration values obtained from Ocean Color (MODIS/AQUA) Data using SeaWIFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) software. From this, an equation for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration in Lake Malawi from MODIS satellite imagery was developed and used for mapping the spatial distribution of chlorophyll-a concentration in the lake. Since Lake Malawi is an oligotrophic lake, with an average value of chlorophyll concentration of 1 μg/L, areas in the lake with relatively high chlorophyll-a concentration were identified as potential locations {{for the development of}} the fishery industry. Estimation of <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> using satellite imagery involved two main activities. Firstly, in situ measurements of <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> were conducted at the three selected sampling stations over Lake Malawi concurrent with satellite image acquisitions. The second activity involved downloading and processing AVHRR and MODIS/Terra satellite imagery. AVHRR data covered the period September 1997 to February 1998 whereas MODIS/Terra data covered the period May to November, 2006. Both MODIS Land Surface Temperature (MOD 11 A 1) and Ocean Color Sea Surface Temperature (SST) were downloaded from EOS Gateway website and processed into <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature.</b> Two glass thermometers were used to measure temperature directly from the lake surface at a depth of 0 - 7. 0 cm (i. e., skin temperature) and the average of the two readings was recorded as the <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> at a particular sampling station. Observed temperatures were regressed on remotely sensed data. ER Mapper was employed in drawing maps showing the distribution of <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> using the regression equation that was developed. Upwelling and downwelling zones were demarcated from <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> maps. Upwelling zones were identified as areas with a high potential {{for the development of the}} fishery industry because of their association with primary productivity. Using a simple overlay technique, data from both the spatial and temporal distribution of chlorophyll-a and <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> were used to delineate potential fishing grounds in Lake Malawi. The zone extending from Salima up to the northern part of Nkhotakota and the area on the northeastern tip of Lake Malawi were identified as areas of high primary productivity and therefore potential fishing grounds. These areas generally exhibit persistent cool surface waters, indicative of upwelling; and have relatively abundant phytoplankton...|$|E
40|$|When the {{resolution}} of numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models increases, it {{becomes more and more}} important to correctly account for the lake&#x 2013;atmosphere interactions. One possible way to handle lake effects is to use a lake model, which treats the <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> and ice conditions as prognostic variables. Such a parametrisation eliminates the traditional for NWP need to prescribe lake characteristics based on long-term climate averages. At the same time, new in situ and satellite measurements are becoming available for an operational practice. This offers the possibility to assimilate lake observations into the NWP models. We study the applicability of the prognostic and observation-based approaches and compare both. As a first step towards integrated lake data assimilation and forecasting in NWP, we suggest using the results of the prognostic lake parametrisation as the background for objective analysis (spatialisation) of the lake water surface temperature observations. We run NWP experiments in the Nordic conditions, where the freezing and melting of lakes can significantly influence local weather. Our results indicate that a lake model, usually used in climate studies, works well also in the NWP model even without assimilation of observations. However, it is possible to improve the description of the changing lake surface state by using good observation data. In this case, the lake model provides a better background for the data assimilation than a <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> climatology...|$|E

Knowledge of Asian monsoon variations will help extend {{our understanding of}} global atmospheric circulation. Numerous studies on the Tibetan Plateau have demonstrated the great potential of lake sediment records as indicators of monsoon induced climatic changes during the Holocene. This study focuses on a multi-proxy record from Peiku Co, including XRF elemental composition, carbon isotopes of biomarkers, and GDGT indicies (TEX 86, BIT, MBT/CBT), providing a paleoenvironmental history of this region on the southern Tibetan Plateau. The study shows that the climate of the Peiku basin transitioned to wetter conditions after 15 ka BP, but the wetter phase was followed by an arid event between 13 ka and 11. 5 ka BP that likely correlated to the Younger Dryas. The early- to mid-Holocene climate was wetter, while drier climate prevailed after 6. 7 ka BP. The climate of the late- Holocene returned to wetter conditions, probably due to stronger SW monsoons. The cold event at 8. 2 ka BP and a widespread event at 4. 2 ka BP could not be distinctively identified in all the proxy records from Peiku Co. The application of the BIT index indicated a constantly high amount of soil organic matter input to the lake, which biased the mean annual <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> as reconstructed by TEX 86.

Analysis of simultaneously collected SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view sensor) sediment and chlorophyll maps and AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> imagery revealed distinct horizontal physical and biological gradients from nearshore to offshore in late March and April in Lake Michigan. The thermal bar (4 degree C water of highest density) constituted a transition zone from nearshore (warmer) to offshore (colder) waters. We identified two chlorophyll maxima in nearshore and offshore waters, which were separated by the thermal bar in SeaWiFS chlorophyll and PSS data of southern Lake Michigan in late spring. Whereas the nearshore chlorophyll maxima was strongly coupled to resuspended sediment, the offshore chlorophyll maxima was not. Such &quot;out of season &quot; responses were previously nearly impossible to document, given unpredictable and hazardous working conditions at that time of year. The combination of PSS data and SeaWiFS imagery demonstrate the similarity between vertical and horizontal spatial patterns during resuspension events. The vertical distribution of chlorophyll and location of the offshore thermal bar coincide with the horizontal distribution of chlorophyll (as C SAT) and the location of the thermal bar (as seen in satellite-derived <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> (LST) images). The PSS data show a nearshore and offshore chlorophyll maxima separated by a region of low chlorophyll concentration. At times when the thermal bar is present, the PSS chlorophyll minimum is located at or near the thermal bar. Combined SeaWiFS C SAT and AVHRR LST images show the exact same patter.

The <b>lakes</b> are small (<b>surface</b> area, 150 ha) with maximum depths ranging from 3. 5 to 47 m. An empirical model requiring only local air temperature and theoretical clear-sky solar radiation is developed to predict daily mean <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> in summer for each lake. The model approximates the slow integrated response of water temperature to meteorological forcing by applying an exponential smoothing filter to air temperature. Exponential smoothing results in a 35 % improvement in model fit compared with a model using unsmoothed air temperatures. The smoothed air temperatures and clear-sky solar radiation are linearly combined to estimate the daily mean <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The smoothing parameters and the three linear coefficients of the model, obtained individually for each of 15 lakes, are found to relate to lake area and maximum depth, leading {{to the development of}} a general model.

This thesis will directly {{look at some of}} the physical processes within weather systems in the Laurentian Great Lakes region that could be altered in a future climate through a series of convective allowing simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). In the Laurentian Great Lakes region, located at the border of Canada and the United States, the existence of the lakes and the <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> play a key role in the weather and climate of the region. While it is projected that lake temperatures will increase in a future climate, it is still relatively unknown what this change could mean to atmospheric circulations in the region. The case studies presented look at the direct role the <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> has on these circulations during the cold and warm seasons to understand the sensitivity of these circulations to future climate conditions. For a lake-effect snowfall simulation, it is shown that the lake temperature influences the extent and intensity of the snowfall downwind of the lake, while interactions with the topography downwind of the lakes still have a critical role. Warm season simulations showed little influence from the lake temperature on precipitation amounts. However, various degrees of change were seen in atmospheric circulations, from little to no change in the convective initiation along Lake Michigan due to the passing of a potential vorticity feature, to larger changes over Lake Superior to the structure of the barrier jet and a mesoscale convective system. Collectively, these simulations show the importance of resolving the lakes in climate simulations and feedbacks that may not be resolved at lower horizontal resolutions, especially in winter. These simulations also give a baseline for future work testing the sensitivity of storm systems over the region to other components...|$|E

Experiments were carried out to compare winter precipitation simulations with and without the integration of the satellite data. Results show that integration with MODIS LST and NIC LIC significantly improves simulation of lake-effect precipitation over the Great Lakes region by reduced latent heat flux. A composite analysis of lake-effect precipitation events further reveals that more accurately depicted low-level stability and vertical moisture transport forced by the observation-based LST and LIC contribute to the improved simulation of lake-effect precipitation...|$|E
40|$|TIR {{bands in}} the {{atmospheric}} windows 3. 5 - 4. 3 µm and 8 - 13. 5 µm were evaluated with in-situ measurement {{data of the}} <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> collected in Walker Lake, NV, in January 2003. The brightness temperatures at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) calculated by the atmospheric radiative transfer code MODTRAN 4. 0 based on the in-situ measured lake surface temperatures and atmospheric profiles match well with the Aqua MODIS data within 0. 2 K in bands 22, 23, 29, and 31 - 32 {{in the early morning}} and afternoon passes in clear-sky conditions on 19 January. The calibration bias is 0. 55 K in band 20 and 0. 8 K in band 33. The combination of vicarious calibration results of Terra MODIS TIR bands from the Walker Lake field campaigns in October 2001 and January 2003 indicates that there is a variation of 0. 2 - 0. 35 K in the calibration bias in bands 20, 22 - 23, 29 and 33. The averaged calibration bias of Terra MODIS agree...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{the tropics}} in global climate change is {{actively}} debated, particularly {{in regard to the}} timing and magnitude of thermal and hydrological response. Continuous, high-resolution temperature records through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) from tropical oceans have provided much insight but <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> reconstructions do not exist from tropical continental environments. Here we used the TEX₈₆ paleotemperature proxy to reconstruct mean annual <b>lake</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in Lake Malawi, East Africa (9 °– 14 °S). We find a ∼ 3. 5 °C overall warming since the LGM, with temperature reversals of ∼ 2 °C during the Younger Dryas (12. 5 ka BP) and at 8. 2 ka BP. Maximum Holocene temperatures of ∼ 29 °C were found at 5 ka BP, a period preceding severe drought in Africa. These results suggest a substantial thermal response of southeastern tropical Africa to deglaciation and to varying conditions during the Holocene...|$|R
40|$|The Great <b>Lakes</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>Temperature</b> (GLST) {{is the key}} to {{understanding}} the effects of climate change on the Great Lakes (GL). This study provides the first techniques to retrieve pixel-based GLST under all sky conditions by merging skin temperature derived from the MODIS Land <b>Surface</b> <b>Temperature</b> (MOD 11 L 2) and the MODIS Cloud product (MOD 06 L 2) from 6 July 2001 to 31 December 2014, resulting in 18, 807 scenes in total 9373 (9434) scenes for MOD 11 L 2 (MOD 06 L 2). The pixel-based GLST under all sky conditions was well-correlated with the in situ observations (R 2 = 0. 9102) with a cool bias of − 1. 10 °C and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1. 39 °C. The study also presents the long-term trends of GLST. Contrary to expectations, it decreased slightly due to the impact of an anomalously cold winter in 2013 – 2014...|$|R
40|$|Lake-effect {{precipitation}} {{is common}} in the Great Lakes region, particularly during the late fall and winter. The synoptic processes of lake-effect precipitation are well understood by operational forecasters, but individual forecast events still present a challenge. Locally run, high resolution models can assist the forecaster in identifying the onset and duration of precipitation, but model results are sensitive to initial conditions, particularly the assumed <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> of the Great Lakes. The NASA Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center has created a Great <b>Lakes</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>Temperature</b> (GLST) composite, which uses infrared estimates of water temperatures obtained from the MODIS instrument aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites, other coarser resolution infrared data when MODIS is not available, and ice cover maps produced by the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab (GLERL). This product has been implemented into the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model Environmental Modeling System (WRF-EMS), used within forecast offices to run local, high resolution forecasts. The sensitivity of the model forecast to the GLST product was analyzed with {{a case study of}} the Lake Effect Storm Echinacea, which produced 10 to 12 inches of snowfall downwind of Lake Erie, and 8 to 18 inches downwind of Lake Ontario from 27 - 29 January 2010. This research compares a forecast using the default Great <b>Lakes</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> from the Real Time Global sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> (RTG SST), in the WRF-EMS model to the enhanced NASA SPoRT GLST product to study forecast impacts. Results from this case study show that the SPoRT GLST contained less ice cover over Lake Erie and generally cooler water temperatures over Lakes Erie and Ontario. Latent and sensible heat fluxes over Lake Ontario were decreased in the GLST product. The GLST product decreased the quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF), which can be correlated to the decrease in temperatures and heat fluxes. A slight increase in precipitation coverage was noted over Lake Erie due to a decrease in ice cover. Both the RTG SST and the GLST products predicted the precipitation south of the actual location of precipitation. This single case study is the first part of an examination to determine how MODIS data can be applied to improve model forecasts in the Great Lakes region...|$|R
