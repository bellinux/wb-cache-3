Jet beaded necklaces strung in a crescent shape have been found at sites including Poltalloch and Melfort in Argyll and Aberlemno in Angus.|$|E

50|$|Three Provincial <b>lunulae</b> were {{discovered}} in Kerivoa, Brittany (Kerivoa-en-Bourbriac, Côtes-d'Armor) in {{the remains of a}} box with some sheet gold and a rod of gold. The rod had its terminals hammered flat in the manner of the lunuae. From this it is thought that <b>Lunulae</b> were made by hammering a rod of gold flat so it became sheet-like and fitted the desired shape. Decoration was then applied by impressing designs with a stylus. The stylus used often leaves tell-tale impressions {{on the surface of the}} gold and it is thought that all the <b>lunulae</b> from Kerivoa, and another two from Saint-Potan, Brittany and Harlyn Bay, Cornwall were all made with the same tool. This suggests that all five <b>lunulae</b> were the work of one craftsperson and the contents of the Kerivoa box their tools of trade.|$|R

25|$|Inchoatia megdova {{differs from}} Inchoatia haussknechti in the {{presence}} of a short basalis, absence of a sulcalis, clausilium plate with edge at the outer margin. Carinigera pharsalica has a less slender shell, the cervical keels are weaker, the suture is even less papillated, a dorsal <b>lunula</b> and no frontal upper palatalis, the outer edge of the clausilium is weaker.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} horny brown, weakly striated. The cervix is more {{prominently}} striated. The shell has 11-13 whorls with white suture. The cervix is with weak basal keel. The dorsal keel is very weak if present. The aperture is not detached. The parietalis and columellaris is prominent, <b>lunula</b> dorsolateral, basalis very short. There is no platal callus and no frontal upper palatalis. Subcolumellaris {{is visible in}} a perpendicular view. Clausilium plate is usually with edge at the outer margin.|$|E
25|$|The 1st century AD saw the {{widespread}} use of plate fibulae. Plate fibulae consist of a flat plate. Since there is little space between the fibula body and the pin (there is no arch to the body), plate fibulae could not be used to fasten much material and were therefore mainly decorative. Most plate fibulae have a hinge assembly on the back. Plate fibulae are generally associated with women’s graves. The most common forms of plate fibula in the 1st century AD were round (disc), diamond, oval and <b>lunula</b> (crescent- or moon-shaped).|$|E
5000|$|In 1865 a {{labourer}} {{found two}} wafer-thin crescents of gold known as <b>lunulae</b> at Harlyn Bay. They probably {{date from the}} early Bronze Age, and were probably deposited as grave goods, as there are several prehistoric burial mounds nearby. The shape of these <b>lunulae</b> indicates a symbolic meaning. They represent the crescent horns of the moon, and may thus have been objects of great ritual and ceremonial significance. The site of the finds was above Onjohn Cove, a small cove between Harlyn Bay and Cataclews Point at [...]|$|R

25|$|Ireland has the {{greatest}} concentration of gold <b>lunulae</b> and stone wrist-guards in Europe. However, neither of these items were deposited in graves {{and they tend to}} be found isolated and at random, making it difficult to draw conclusions about their use or role in society at the time.|$|R
25|$|Nail growth record {{can show}} the history of recent health and {{physiological}} imbalances, and {{has been used as}} a diagnostic tool since ancient times. Deep transverse grooves known as Beau's lines may form across the nails (not along the nail from cuticle to tip) and are usually a natural consequence of aging, though they may result from disease. Discoloration, thinning, thickening, brittleness, splitting, grooves, Mees' lines, small white spots, receded <b>lunula,</b> clubbing (convex), flatness, and spooning (concave) can indicate illness in other areas of the body, nutrient deficiencies, drug reaction or poisoning, or merely local injury.|$|E
25|$|For a long time, {{scholarship}} {{considered the}} younger girl as a boy. Recent research definitely {{proves that the}} chubby-cheeked child with ears sticking out is a girl. Around her neck is a leather band with a <b>lunula</b> pendant, an apotropaic amulet commonly worn by women or girls. Her chiton is violet in colour, a feature exclusive to females. Further it has partially fallen, exposing her left shoulder, an attribute of the goddess Aphrodite, aimed to underline erotic attraction. It is commonly used on the mummy portraits of women and even young girls. Thus, the child's gender is indubitably female.|$|E
25|$|Boys {{and girls}} of citizen family wore amulets {{to protect them}} from immoral or baleful {{influences}} such as the evil eye and sexual predation. For boys, the amulet was a bulla, worn around the neck; the equivalent for girls was a crescent-shaped <b>lunula.</b> The toga praetexta, which was thought to offer similar apotropaic protection, was formal wear for freeborn boys until puberty, usually around 14 years of age, when they gave their toga praetexta and childhood bulla into the care of their family lares and put on the adult male's toga virilis. According to some Roman literary sources, freeborn girls might also wear - or at least, had the right to wear - a toga praetexta until marriage, when they offered their childhood toys, and perhaps their maidenly praetexta to Fortuna Virginalis; others claim a gift made to the family Lares, or to Venus, as part of their passage to adulthood. In traditionalist families, unmarried girls might be expected to wear their hair demurely bound in a fillet.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lunulae</b> were {{probably}} replaced as neck ornaments firstly by gold torcs, found from the Irish Middle Bronze Age, {{and then in}} the Late Bronze Age by the spectacular gorgets of thin ribbed gold, some with round discs at the side, of which 9 examples survive, 7 in the National Museum of Ireland.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{its natural}} resources, Ireland had a [...] "rich Early Bronze Age metal-working industry", {{producing}} {{large quantities of}} metal axes, halberds and daggers, and {{as a part of}} this also had a [...] "major gold industry", seeing the production of <b>lunulae</b> and gold disks on a far larger scale than Britain.|$|R

[...] Representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in Kilmartin, and a boat pecked into Wemyss Cave, are probably the oldest two-dimensional representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Elaborate carved stone battle-axes may be symbolic representations of power. Surviving metalwork includes gold <b>lunula</b> or neckplates, jet beaded necklaces and elaborate weaponry, such as leaf swords and ceremonial shields of sheet bronze.|$|E

2500|$|Together, the {{eponychium}} and the cuticle form {{a protective}} seal. [...] The cuticle is the semi-circular layer of non-living, almost invisible dead skin cells that [...] "ride out on" [...] {{and cover the}} back of the visible nail plate while the eponychium is the fold of skin cells that produces the cuticle. They are continuous, and some references view them as one entity; in this classification, the names eponychium, cuticle, and perionychium are synonymous. It is the cuticle (nonliving part) that is removed during a manicure, but the eponychium (living part) should not be touched due to risk of infection. [...] The eponychium is a small band of living cells (epithelium) that extends from the posterior nail wall onto the base of the nail. [...] The eponychium {{is the end of the}} proximal fold that folds back upon itself to shed an epidermal layer of skin onto the newly formed nail plate. The perionyx is the projecting edge of the eponychium covering the proximal strip of the <b>lunula.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Gold leaf is {{sometimes}} used in art in a [...] "raw" [...] state, without a gilding process. In cultures including the European Bronze Age {{it was used}} to wrap objects such as bullae simply by folding it tightly over, and the Classical group of gold <b>lunulae</b> are so thin, especially in the centre, that they might be classed as gold leaf. It has been used in jewellery in various periods, often as small pieces hanging freely.|$|R

50|$|Examples include {{ceremonial}} bronze helmets, ornamental ax-heads and swords, elaborate instruments such as lurer, {{and other}} ceremonial objects without a practical purpose, {{such as the}} oversize Oxborough Dirk. Special objects were made in gold; many more gold objects have survived from Western and Central Europe than from the Iron Age, many mysterious and strange objects ranging from <b>lunulas,</b> apparently an Irish speciality, the Mold Cape and Golden hats.

If one damages the <b>lunula,</b> the nail will be permanently deformed. Even when the totality of the nail is removed, the <b>lunula</b> remains in place and is similar in appearance to another smaller fingernail embedded in the nail bed.|$|E

It {{is not possible to}} confirm that these use Welsh gold since there were strong trade links between Wales and Ireland at the time and Ireland was the major area of gold working in the Bronze Age British Isles. Irish gold is especially well known from the Irish Bronze Age as jewellery, in the form of gold <b>lunulae,</b> torcs, [...] "gorgets", rings, and bracelets.

50|$|The {{central area}} of the museum {{contains}} {{one of the finest}} collections of Bronze Age gold objects in Europe. The goldwork ranges in date between 2200 BC and 500 BC, most of it probably being jewellery, but with many objects of unknown (possibly ritual) function. In the early Bronze Age most artefacts were made from sheet gold and include sundiscs and crescent shaped collars called <b>lunulae.</b> In the middle Bronze Age new gold working techniques were developed; starting around 1200 BC a great variety of torcs were produced from twisting bars of gold. Items from the late Bronze Age, starting in 900 BC, include solid gold bracelets and dress-fasteners as well as large sheet gold collars, ear-spools and a necklace of hollow golden balls.|$|R
