40|$|The Fraunhofer Institute for Wood Research at the Wilhelm-Klauditz Institute (WKI) in Braunschweig {{has been}} {{involved}} in researching and testing <b>laminate</b> <b>floor</b> <b>coverings</b> ever since their market introduction. Key themes over recent years have undoubtedly been the properties of the wide diversity of non-adhesive based joining systems. For the industry a critical consideration in producing these systems is the "pull-out forces" or "binding forces" of the separate laminate flooring elements with each other. This is because open joints in a floor covering system are both undesirable to the customer and also permit moisture penetration; hence they increase the likelihood of claims for refunds. To determine whether there is any play between two joined panels the WKI makes use of microscopic analyses of sections of <b>laminate</b> <b>floor</b> <b>coverings</b> and force-and-position diagrams. Keyword room sound: Based on the testing method developed by the WKI involving the use of a hard rubber ball to test acoustic emissions from <b>laminate</b> <b>floor</b> <b>coverings,</b> the Institute has so far analysed around 80 different products on behalf of numerous manufacturers. These analyses have shown that insulation underlays with lower rigidity and greater mass per unit area tend to offer better room sound attenuation. An orientational trial on materials with known properties is intended to clarify the usefulness of the idea involving the standardized striking mechanism and the loudness analyses. By the autumn of 2002 some details still had to be reolved for this standardized method of measurement, however, in particular the mathematical compensation for the inherent noise of the striking mechanism. In addition, rather than expressing the loudness of the product as an absolute value, the intention is to express it as a percentage value relative to the loudness of a floating standard laminate floor covering...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Laminate</b> <b>floor</b> <b>coverings,</b> with {{fiberboard}} in {{the middle}} layer, are hygroscopic which caused potential dimension instability. The paper tested thickness swelling (TS) and water absorption (WA) of 10 commercial laminate floors (LF) according to G/T 18102 - 2007 (GB/T) and LY/T 1611 - 2011 (LY/T) and analyzed correlation between them. The results show that TS obtained by the GB/T method differed significantly from LY/T methods at the initial 14 days. 7 d-TS and 7 d-WA values of test specimen measuring 50 by 50 mm both correlated well with internal bond (IB). For both kinds of test methods, the moisture content almost reached saturation at 28 days...|$|E
50|$|<b>Laminate</b> <b>flooring</b> (also called {{floating}} wood tile in the United States) is a multi-layer synthetic flooring product fused {{together with}} a lamination process. <b>Laminate</b> <b>flooring</b> simulates wood (or sometimes stone) with a photographic applique layer under a clear protective layer. The inner core layer is usually composed of melamine resin and fiber board materials. There is a European Standard No. EN 13329:2000 specifying <b>laminate</b> <b>floor</b> <b>covering</b> requirements and testing methods.|$|R
50|$|<b>Laminate</b> is a <b>floor</b> <b>covering</b> {{that appears}} similar to {{hardwood}} but {{is made with}} a plywood or medium density fiberboard ("MDF") core with a plastic laminate top layer. HDF laminate consists of high density fiberboard topped {{by one or more}} layers of decorative paper and a transparent protective layer. Laminate may be more durable than hardwood, but cannot be refinished like hardwood. <b>Laminate</b> <b>flooring</b> is available in many different patterns which can resemble different woods or even ceramic tile. It usually locks or taps together. Underlayment is required for <b>laminate</b> <b>flooring</b> to provide moisture and noise control.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} was seemingly unchanged through the years. Its columns and walls were painted in bright greens and yellows with chrome siding, {{it had a}} stainless steel edged counter with rows of chrome counter stools, and terrazzo <b>floors,</b> <b>laminate</b> wall <b>covering,</b> and a ceiling with indirect lighting coves. The chairs were bright yellow, orange and green. Walls were covered in photographs of celebrities who had dined at the restaurant; one spot was dubbed [...] "Bens Wall of Fame". Bens employed only waiters, who wore a black bow tie and white buttoned shirt with black dress pants and shoes, along with a white waist apron.|$|R
40|$|During {{the recent}} years the {{radiation}} of walking noise ("drum sound") of <b>laminate</b> <b>floor</b> <b>coverings</b> has become an important product property for marketing. Producers of floors are optimizing their products using attached underlays to attenuate drum sound, and the EPLF developed a measurement and evaluation procedure in cooperation with research institutes: A modified tapping machine is operating on the sample area laid in a test room with concrete floor and sufficient sound absorption. The stationary sound signal is recorded and post-processed using the Zwicker loudness analysis. The result is an overall loudness value (in Sone) and a diagram of specific loudness where the frequency components of the sound can be assessed. Today, very different types of underlay attachements for drum sound attenuation are in use. The range of materials comprises duroplastic or thermoplastic coatings, more or less stiff thermoplastic mats, recycled plastics, rubber mats, and soft fibre boards. Experiences from measurements for many floor and underlay products carried out at WKI show that the materials can perform very differently. But {{this is not only}} due to the type of underlay of floor material. Drum sound attenuation is a combined effect of laminate properties, thickness and stiffness of the underlay and the laying method. The difference of overall loudness values between "silent" and "loud" products can be up to 25 Sone. Typical for laminate floorings are a lower frequency peak (400 [...] . 1000 Hz) - probably caused by resonance effects between the areas mass of the laminate flooring and the stiffness and thickness of the underlay - and another peak at 2000 [...] . 3000 Hz corresponding to a "rattling" sound from the hard covering. Some products with underlays show a good attenuation of "rattling" sound components, others a shift of the low-frequency components in the spectra. The technical development of material combinations with improved performance is going on. There is still a need for modelling the process of drum sound generation and radiation so that further improvements can be expected...|$|E
40|$|Drum {{sound is}} the sound {{produced}} when an object, such as a foot, hits the flooring in the room in which the receiving ear is located. Drum sound has attracted interest in recent years, particularly due to an increased use of thin floating floor constructions, such as veneer or laminate flooring, which can produce loud and sharp walking sound. A prediction model of the subjective response, in a paired comparison test, to drum sound based on differences in objective measurements is developed. The difference in 10 -percentile loudness, N 10, between two stimuli is shown to predict the subjective perceived disturbance better than, for example, A-weighted sound pressure level. A difference of about 8 % in N 10 resulted in 50 % of the assessors noticing a difference. A comparison of different existing approaches to analysing the result from a paired comparison test is made. The main focus is set on the basic models by Thurstone-Mosteller and Bradley-Terry and extensions of these concerning ties. Procedures for testing if the responses and calculated ranking values are statistically different are presented. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} these methods are discussed. These methods are illustrated with examples from tests on drum sound from floor coverings. A branch norm has been established for measuring drum sound on <b>laminate</b> <b>floor</b> <b>coverings.</b> The norm evaluates the subjective perception of the drum sound's loudness using the ISO tapping machine. A round-robin study of the norm is reported along with the results of a paired comparison listening test using the same floor coverings. General aspects of evaluation measures, tapping machines, test environments, etc., that need to be considered when measuring drum sound on various floor coverings are discussed. It is concluded that loudness as measured according to ISO 532 B correlates the best with the subjective perception of the drum sound's loudness. The tapping machine can be used to excite hard floor coverings to produce the drum sound, but should be used with caution in studying low-level drum sounds due to the tapping machine's inherent mechanical noise...|$|E
40|$|Thermography is {{a remote}} and {{nondestructive}} technique {{for the detection}} of defects usually not visible on the surface, e. g. cracks, delaminations, splitting, resin pockets, and black knots. Experiences from industrial measurements show that the technique is capable to inspect a surface or a structure element in one view and to solve several production problems. Passive thermography can be applied {{for the detection of}} defects if the objects under study undergo a heat treatment {{in the course of the}} production process. In this case, the cooling of the surface after the respective process step (e. g., after leaving the press) is observed with an infrared camera. Usually the surface temperature decreases homogenously within the inspected area. However, above or in the neighborhood of typical hidden defects such as air inclusions or delaminations, the heat conduction in the material is reduced, and therefore invisible defects appear as "cold spots" on the surface. Examples from measurements in industrial processes show the capability of this method to detect poor and good bonding of decorative paper on particle boards as well as density distributions in OSB and poor pressing in the gluelam production. If production heat can not be utilized, the heat has to be provided externally (active thermography), for instance by an infrared heat source which the samples pass when moving on a conveyor belt. While passing the heater the surface temperature increases by a few degrees centigrade, and the heat diffuses into the cold part of the object more or less homogenously. However, the heat conductivity is different (normally lower) near hidden defects so that the corresponding surface area remains warm for a longer time. By observing the surface under investigation with an infrared camera the faults can thus be identified as "hot spots" in the thermal image. In some cases, the excitation of the material with high power ultrasound is the best method to detect defects within the material. Especially in the case of black/dead knots and very small cracks the ultrasonic excitation will create heat along the defects because of friction. The heat produced by friction can be detected with the infrared camera, and the area can thus be identified as defective. Some examples from modern composite materials such as glass-fiber-reinforced plastic glued on particle boards, <b>laminated</b> <b>floor</b> <b>coverings,</b> and lightweight table plates made from plywood and/or composite materials will be presented in the talk, showing the detection of typical defects using this technique...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the impact}} of {{modelling}} furniture and <b>floor</b> <b>covering</b> in thermal building simulations is analysed and a distinct effect upon the simulated room temperatures under dynamic temperature control conditions is found. For the thermal steady state, the impact is negligible and for short-time temperature reductions, as know from night temperature set-back, the found differences are also not significant. However, if a room is dynamically heated, for example while charging its thermal mass {{as a measure of}} load shifting, distinct temperature differences between empty and furnished rooms are detected. After just 4 hours of increased set temperature, an empty massive room was 1. 2 K warmer than the same modelled room with <b>laminate</b> <b>flooring</b> and furniture inside.
