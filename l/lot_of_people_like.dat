500|$|For {{the first}} year of {{development}} the team focused mostly on the gameplay without any narrative structure. Playtesters found the game to be fun but asked about what these test chambers were leading towards. This prompted to team {{to come up with a}} narrative for Portal. The Portal team worked with Half-Life series writer Marc Laidlaw on fitting the game into the series' plot. This was done, in part, due to the limited art capabilities of the small team; instead of creating new assets for Portal, they decided to tie the game to an existing franchise—Half-Life—to allow them to reuse the Half-Life 2 art assets. Wolpaw and Faliszek were put to work on the dialogue for Portal. The concept of a computer AI guiding the player through experimental facilities to test the portal gun was arrived at early in the writing process. They drafted early lines for the yet-named [...] "polite" [...] AI with humorous situations, such as requesting the player's character to [...] "assume the party escort submission position", and found this style of approach to be well-suited to the game they wanted to create, ultimately leading to the creation of the GLaDOS character. GLaDOS was central to the plot, as Wolpaw notes [...] "We designed the game to have a very clear beginning, middle, and end, and we wanted GLaDOS to go through a personality shift at each of these points." [...] Wolpaw further describes the idea of using cake as the reward came about as [...] "at the beginning of the Portal development process, we sat down as a group to decide what philosopher or school of philosophy our game would be based on. That was followed by about 15 minutes of silence and then someone mentioned that a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> cake." [...] The cake element along with additional messages given to the player in the behind-the-scenes areas were written and drawn by Kim Swift.|$|E

I was demanding my right to practice the most basic human rights—freedom of expression and thought—so nothing was done in vain. I believe I'm just a scapegoat for a larger conflict. There are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> me in Saudi Arabia who are fighting for their rights." [...] Kashgari described the status of women's rights in Saudi Arabia by stating that Saudi women [...] "won't go to hell 'because it's impossible to go there twice." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{felt that}} the whole thing was out of taste and tried in vain, in one of the pauses, to give a lead to my hostess by {{referring}} to the prospect of a shipping subsidy bill going through to offset the register of alien ships. But she was too utterly dense to take it up. She never even turned her head. All through dinner that ass talked --he and that silly young actor they're always asking there that is perpetually doing imitations of the vaudeville people. That kind of thing may be all right, for those who care for it--I frankly don't--outside a theatre. But to my mind the idea of trying to throw people into fits of laughter at a dinner-table is simply execrable taste. I cannot see the sense of people shrieking with laughter at dinner. I have, I suppose, a better sense of humour than most people. But to my mind a humourous story should be told quietly and slowly in a way to bring out the point of the humour and to make it quite clear by preparing for it with proper explanations. But with people like that I find I no sooner get well started with a story than some fool or other breaks in. I had a most amusing experience the other day--that is, about fifteen years ago--at a summer hotel in the Adirondacks, that one would think would have amused even a shallow <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> those, but I had no sooner started to tell it--or had hardly done more than to describe the Adirondacks in a general way--than, first thing I know, my hostess, stupid woman, had risen and all the ladies were trooping out.|$|E

30|$|A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> daily {{activities}} require {{two or more}} people to collaborate. For instance, playing tennis, squash, rock climbing, and ballroom dancing. However, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>liking</b> these activities suffer from finding good partners. Some people have partners; however, it is still impossible to engage in these activities {{at the time they}} preferred since their partners might not be available at that time. Also, partners with different levels usually do not enjoy playing with each other. Everyone wants to have good partners since good partners can help each other improve their performance and skills efficiently. Lacking of matched partners really can ice people’s enthusiasm for these activities. An application which can find good partners for people has high practical utility. Obviously, it can encourage more people to engage in these activities.|$|R

I know that a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> Nightmare Anatomy and I think it's a great record for where we were at as a band then.

I {{was one of those}} obnoxious {{teenagers}} that thought that the music I liked was great and everything else sucked. Getting that Oingo Boingo song in the film was a big fight. But I had to make some compromises and put in some songs that I didn't like at all." ...|$|E

THEY don't put the salve on--oh, no, that would be sin; but they know how to fool YOU into putting it on, then it's you that blinds yourself.

5000|$|In 1982, Teena Marie {{got into}} a heated legal battle with Motown Records over her {{contract}} and disagreements about releasing her new material. The lawsuit resulted in [...] "The Brockert Initiative", which made it illegal for a record company to keep an artist under contract without releasing new material for that artist. In such instances, artists are able to sign and release with another label instead of being held back by an unsupportive one. Teena Marie commented on the law in an LA Times article, saying, [...] "It wasn't something I set out to do. I {{just wanted to get}} away from Motown and have a good life. But it helped a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> <b>like</b> Luther Vandross and the Mary Jane Girls, and a lot of different artists, {{to be able to get}} out of their contracts."
