She does not tell Mulder about this, and the pair discuss the possibility that Boggs has orchestrated the kidnapping with a partner to avoid execution. They have a fake newspaper made which declares the couple to have been found, hoping to trick Boggs into contacting his accomplice. He does not fall for the trick, but gives the agents vague clues about the case. Scully, acting on these, first finds a warehouse where the couple had been held, and later leads Mulder and several other agents to a boathouse where the kidnapper is holding the couple. The girl is rescued, but the kidnapper shoots Mulder and escapes with the boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|Flashback is a [...] "fusion of the past, present, and future, {{consisting}} of a totally contagious medley of the best hits and entrancing rhythms". The album's repertoire consists of previously released material along with four new melodies. [...] "Cuéntale" [...] (""), the lead single off the album, has Ivy Queen exploring lyrically as she [...] "plays a mistress who tells her lover to pick between her and his wife". She explained [...] "the mistress just gets tired of seeing him {{for a short time}} and listening to him complain about his unloving wife". Musically, it features danceable grooves, synthetic instrumentation and synthesizers while taking influences from Afro Latin and reggae music; it is set in minor key. [...] "Marroneo" [...] is the second of four newly produced tracks by Rafi Mercenario, [...] "the most highly requested producer in reggaetón" [...] at the time. It received comparisons to Daddy Yankee's [...] "Gasolina". [...] "Si Una Vez" [...] ("") was originally written by Pete Astudillo along with A.B. Quintanilla III and performed by American singer Selena in 1994 on her album Amor Prohibido. Ivy Queen's interpolation of the lyrics tell a story of a [...] "woman who <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> a lover and wonders why she even loved the lout who abused her love". She choose to cover [...] "Si Una Vez" [...] over other songs by Selena including [...] "Como La Flor" [...] ("") and [...] "La Carcacha" [...] because it was the one she could identify with the most, being more inline with what Queen stands for; citing Selena as her primary influence. The [...] "reggaetón-ed up twist" [...] on Selena's classic, features bitter-romantic lyrics, synthetic instrumentation and synthesizers, while taking reggae influences similar to the original. [...] "I feel honored to be able to sing one of Selena's songs," [...] Queen explained. [...] "She was the first artist to make a successful crossover before Jennifer Lopez and all the rest." [...] "Libertad" [...] (""), the last of the four new tracks on the album was composed in minor key tonality. Queen appears infuriated in the lyrics as the songs takes influences from Afro-Latin music.|$|E

2500|$|The movie, {{starring}} Will Smith, Thandie Newton and Smith's son Jaden Smith, {{focused on}} Gardner's nearly one-year struggle with homelessness. The movie grossed $163 million domestically {{at the box}} office and over $300 million worldwide, making it one of Will Smith's consecutive $100 million blockbusters. As a result, it earned Will Smith an Academy Award-Nomination for Best Actor. The movie took some liberties with Gardner's true life story. Certain details and events that actually took place over the span of several years were compressed into a relatively short time and although eight-year-old Jaden portrayed Chris Jr. as a five-year-old, Gardner's son was just a toddler at the time. Chris Gardner reportedly thought Smith—an actor best known for his performances in action movies—was miscast to play him. However, he said his daughter Jacintha [...] "set him straight" [...] by saying, [...] "If Smith can play Muhammad Ali, he can play you!" [...] Gardner makes a cameo appearance in the film, walking past Will and Jaden in the final scene. Gardner and Will acknowledge each other; Will then <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Gardner walking away as his son proceeds to tell him knock knock jokes.|$|E
2500|$|Popular {{entertainment}} perpetuated {{the racist}} {{stereotype of the}} uneducated, ever-cheerful, and highly musical black well into the 1950s. Even as the minstrel show was dying out in all but amateur theater, blackface performers became common acts on vaudeville stages and in legitimate drama. These entertainers kept the familiar songs, dances, and pseudo-black dialect, often in nostalgic <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the old minstrel show. The most famous of these performers is probably Al Jolson, who took blackface {{to the big screen}} in the 1920s in films such as The Jazz Singer (1927). His 1930 film Mammy uses the setting of a traveling minstrel show, giving an on-screen presentation of a performance. Likewise, when the sound era of cartoons began in the late 1920s, early animators such as Walt Disney gave characters such as Mickey Mouse (who already resembled blackface performers) a minstrel-show personality; the early Mickey is constantly singing and dancing and smiling. The face of Raggedy Ann is a color-reversed minstrel mask, and Raggedy Ann's creator, Johnny Gruelle, designed the doll in part with the antics of blackface star Fred Stone in mind. As late as 1942, as demonstrated in the Warner Bros. cartoon Fresh Hare, minstrel shows {{could be used as a}} gag (in this case, Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny leading a chorus of [...] "Camptown Races") with the expectation, presumably, that audiences would get the reference. Radio shows got into the act, a fact perhaps best exemplified by the popular radio shows Two Black Crows, Sam 'n' Henry, and Amos 'n' Andy, A transcription survives from 1931 of The Blue Coal Minstrels, which uses many of the standard forms of the minstrel show, including Tambo, Bones and the interlocutor. The National Broadcasting Company, in a 1930 pamphlet, used the minstrel show as a point of reference in selling its services. [...] As recently as the mid-1970s the BBC broadcast The Black and White Minstrel Show starring the George Mitchell Minstrels. The racist archetypes that blackface minstrelsy helped to create persist to this day; some argue that this is even true in hip hop culture and movies. The 2000 Spike Lee movie Bamboozled alleges that modern black entertainment exploits African-American culture much as the minstrel shows did a century ago, for example.|$|E
