50|$|The next twenty-six years, 1933-1959, {{would be}} the {{duration}} of his commercial art career in illustration. He joined with a <b>layout</b> <b>man,</b> Walter Wenzel, and together they freelanced as commercial artists. Thompson’s next job was with a large studio in Chicago, Vogue-Wright Studios. In addition to freelancing in the ad business, he taught at the American Academy of Art in 1935-37.|$|E
50|$|William A. Kittredge {{was born}} in 1891 in Lowell, Massachusetts to printer Albion Kittredge and was apprenticed to Thomas Parkhurst of the Parkhurst Press. After his apprenticeship, {{he worked at the}} Riverside Press in Cambridge, art {{director}} for a printing house in Philadelphia and various printing houses in New York and Boston as composer, pressman, <b>layout</b> <b>man,</b> and art director.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, {{he joined}} the Jaime Díaz Studios as a <b>layout</b> <b>man</b> and participated in several TV series such as Aladdin, Timon & Pumbaa, Wildfire, Scooby-Doo, The Smurfs, The Jetsons, and The Pink Panther, while {{continuing}} to create terror stories for the German comic book series Gespenster Geschichten (Bastei-Verlag editions). He also published in magazines like Sex Humor, Fierro, Satiricón and Zona 84. Since 2006, he has been writing the scripts for the Los Grutynos comic strip, published in Argentine Patagonia.|$|E
25|$|This first {{council was}} {{responsible}} for determining subscriptions, membership control, copy vigilance, press relations and a programme of art exhibitions, publications and functions. In addition, they were tasked with selecting 10 more honorary members and a further 50 ordinary members, to {{be made up of}} noteworthy people wholly engaged in creative work - copywriters, copy chiefs, artists, art directors, <b>layout</b> <b>men,</b> visualisers and more.|$|R
50|$|He was {{actively}} involved in efforts to unionize the staff of Leon Schlesinger Studios. He was responsible for recruiting animators, <b>layout</b> <b>men,</b> and background people. Almost all animators joined, in reaction to salary cuts imposed by Leon Schlesinger. The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio had already signed a union contract, encouraging their counterparts under Schlesinger. In a meeting with his staff, Schlesinger talked for a few minutes, then turned over the meeting to his attorney. His insulting manner had a unifying effect on the staff. Jones gave a pep talk at the union headquarters. As negotiations broke down, the staff decided to go on strike. Schlesinger locked {{them out of the}} studio for a few days, before agreeing to sign the contract. A Labor Management Committee was formed and Jones served as a moderator. Because of his role as a supervisor in the studio, he could not himself join the union. Jones created many of his lesser-known characters during this period, including Charlie Dog, Hubie and Bertie, and The Three Bears.|$|R
40|$|The unclear {{picture of}} the sex {{difference}} in color preference might result from personality variations. We invited 359 Chinese university students (166 men and 193 women) to undergo a color preference test and the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ), a five-factor model test. Depressive trends were measured by the Plutchik-van Praag Depression Inventory (PVP). There {{was no significant difference}} between men and women regarding either ZKPQ or PVP scale scores. However, men preferred blue and green significantly more, and their preference order of yellow was negatively correlated with ZKPQ Sociability. Women preferred purple, pink and white significantly more, their preference order of gray was positively correlated with Neuroticism-Anxiety, and the order of orange negatively with Aggression-Hostility. Our results suggest that, partly from a biological <b>layout,</b> <b>men</b> as hunters and women as gatherers prefer some different colors on the one hand, but from a social structural layout, they might try to adjust some personality traits by preferring other colors on the other, in order to attain a sex-equality but polychromatic world. 6 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|Previously, the studio's {{backgrounds}} {{had been}} considered to be somewhat unattractive by Jones, using a fairly mundane style with muted colors (which Jones disparagingly referred to as [...] "shit-brindle"). Under McGrew and his contemporary layout artists (including Thomas McKimson in Robert Clampett's unit, along with Owen Fitzgerald and then Hawley Pratt in Friz Freleng's unit), the animators pioneered a far more abstract method of drawing the backgrounds, which set them apart from competing studios such as Disney. While Jones's subsequent layout designers, Earl Klein and later Robert Gribbroek would return to a more normal style of background design, his most famous <b>layout</b> <b>man,</b> Maurice Noble took up an abstract style {{that in many ways}} resembled McGrew's earlier work.|$|E
50|$|Besides his comics work, Hoberg {{has been}} active in {{animation}} since 1978 as a storyboard artist, model designer, and <b>layout</b> <b>man</b> for Hanna-Barbera, Ruby-Spears, Filmation, Marvel Productions, Marvel Films, DIC Entertainment, Universal Studios, The Walt Disney Company, Cartoon Network, Film Roman, Warner Bros., and many other studios. Among the many animated series Hoberg has contributed to are Godzilla, Super Friends, Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, The Incredible Hulk, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, Jem, Defenders of the Earth, Spider-Man, Justice League, X-Men, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Hoberg also served as a director/producer for Marvel Productions, where he co-created the first X-Men cartoon, Pryde of the X-Men. Recent animation work includes Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, Ultimate Spider-Man, War of the Worlds: Goliath, and Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H..|$|E
5000|$|Nordli, nicknamed [...] "Ernie", was {{a talented}} artist whose work had an {{appealing}} modern sensibility. He started at Disney in 1936 {{and served as}} an art director/layout artist on Dumbo and Fantasia, and worked {{on many of the}} studio's shorts through the mid-1940s, including such Donald Duck shorts as The Plastics Inventor and Donald's Double Trouble. He left Disney and in the 1950s became the layout artist for Chuck Jones, in the absence of Maurice Noble. He was the <b>layout</b> <b>man</b> on eight Jones shorts, including some memorable films like Broom-Stick Bunny and Rocket-bye Baby (both 1956). After his short stint with Jones, Nordli returned to Disney where he worked on Sleeping Beauty and One Hundred and One Dalmatians, on which he was a layout stylist. He {{played an important role in}} designing the background drawing style on Dalmatians.|$|E
5000|$|Founded in 1946 {{by some of}} the industry’s leading practitioners, the TDC’s {{earliest}} membership included Aaron Burns, Will Burtin, Freeman Craw, Louis Dorfsman, Gene Federico, Edward M. Gottschall, Herb Lubalin, Edward Rondthaler, Bradbury Thompson, and Hermann Zapf. With this solid historical background, the TDC today represents {{and rewards}} the best of today’s type design and type use. Founding member Milton Zudek described the club’s goals at their first exhibit opening in 1947: “We simply want to make more and more advertising people {{aware of the importance of}} the agency typographer. We want them to realize that the selection of type for an advertisement demands a sixth sense that goes beyond the basic knowledge of typefaces—that it demands, in effect, the same kind of artistic sense that people have learned to associate with Art Directors, but are still learning to associate with Type Directors.” Speaking that same night, Paul Lang, a member of the Art Directors Club remarked, “When I began, artists were called <b>layout</b> <b>men,</b> renderers or finishers. When we insisted upon being called art directors, the advertising execs would say, ‘Call yourselves anything you like, but give us what we want.’ By the same token, if type directors keep calling themselves just that, they will, in time, be recognized for what they actually do contribute.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The photos {{appearing}} in the magazine had various sources; some are obtained from companies that produce gay pornographic films (although most <b>layouts</b> depict individual <b>men,</b> rather than simulated [...] "action" [...] scenes). Photographers whose work appeared in Black Inches include Anneli Adolfsson, Ken Kavanagh, Brian Lantelme, and Abednego (formerly associated with Mansurf.com). The magazine also carried film reviews, erotic stories, cartoons, and advertisements.|$|R
2500|$|The {{successor}} {{states of}} Alexander the Great's empire built galleys that were like triremes or biremes in oar <b>layout,</b> but <b>manned</b> with additional rowers for each oar. The ruler Dionysius I of Syracuse (ca. 432–367 BC) {{is credited with}} pioneering the [...] "five" [...] and [...] "six", meaning five or six rows of rowers plying two or three rows of oars. Ptolemy II (283-46 BC) {{is known to have}} built a large fleet of very large galleys with several experimental designs rowed by everything from 12 up to 40 rows of rowers, though most of these are considered to have been quite impractical. Fleets with large galleys were put in action in conflicts such as the Punic Wars (246-146) between the Roman republic and Carthage, which included massive naval battles with hundreds of vessels {{and tens of thousands of}} soldiers, seamen and rowers.|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{a systems}} engineering and design capstone project, {{directed by the}} Total Ship Systems Engineering (TSSE) faculty and undertaken by students in the TSSE program at the Naval Postgraduate School and performed over two academic quarters. It takes {{a fresh look at}} the basic design and operation of the modem aircraft carrier, assuming availability of short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft, employing gas turbine ship propulsion and providing significant capability to support humanitarian operations. In the design study reported here, the authors take a systems engineering approach to a totally new carrier design which may best suit the requirements for the next generation aircraft carrier. The central goal was to provide a ship to meet all of the current mission requirements of the existing Nimitz class carriers but in a platform that is significantly lower in life cycle costs. The outcome is a ship based on a concept called "super-island"; a large island structure that can provides drive-through "pit- stops" for aircraft refueling and rearming as well as other major functions. Other areas of major innovation include: weapons handling, information processing and distribution, engineering <b>layout</b> and <b>manning.</b> The report provides an overview of the major ship systems as well as detailed discussions of selected design areas chosen to illustrate those systems that had the most impact on meeting design goals...|$|R
