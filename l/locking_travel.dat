5|$|The {{following}} list numbers {{the locks}} from the River Avon in Bristol to the River Thames. It includes one lock {{that has been}} removed (98, Ufton Lock) and two that have been combined to form a single deep lock (8 and 9, now Bath Deep <b>Lock).</b> <b>Travelling</b> from Bristol to Reading, locks 1 to 54 are uphill, and locks 55 to 107 are downhill.|$|R
5000|$|Ward <b>Lock</b> <b>travel</b> guides or Red Guides (1870s - 1970s) were tourist guide {{books to}} the British Isles and {{continental}} Europe published by Ward, Lock & Co. of London. The firm proclaimed them [...] "amusing and readable" [...] and the [...] "cheapest and most trustworthy guides." [...] To other readers {{the books were}} promotional and [...] "rarely critical." [...] Compared to similar late 19th century series such as Methuen & Co.'s Little Guides, the Ward Lock guides emphasized [...] "travel practicalities." ...|$|R

50|$|The <b>locks</b> reduce <b>travel</b> {{time because}} it enables large {{commercial}} tows {{to go through}} only one lockage rather than the three locks it replaced. Also the large lock chamber allows a large vessels {{to pass through the}} lock in a single operation instead of using smaller lock sections.|$|R

He is also able to interface his techno-organic body parts with machinery, using them to hack into computers, open electronic <b>locks,</b> and <b>travel</b> through time.|$|R
5000|$|After July 1943, the appliqué armor bosses on {{the hull}} {{side of the}} M10A1 were deleted as the armor kits were never manufactured. This meant that some M36s had the {{redundant}} bosses, while others did not. The M36 initially retained the M10A1's [...] "stirrup" [...] gun rest on the rear hull; crews were unhappy {{about the lack of}} a proper <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> for the 90 mm gun, and many improvised their own from <b>travel</b> <b>locks</b> taken from tanks. As the massive muzzle blast of the 90 mm gun obscured the crew's vision and reduced the rate of fire, a double-baffle muzzle brake was fitted to all vehicles after the first 600, beginning in early November 1944. A proper folding <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> better-suited to the 90 mm gun was added to the rear hull at about this time. The gun itself was also modified with a better equilibrator and more powerful elevating mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Old Ford Lock {{marks the}} start of the Hackney Cut [...] - [...] an {{artificial}} channel built in the 18th century to cut off a large loop in the natural channel. The natural river rejoins the Navigation at this point [...] - [...] below the <b>lock,</b> having <b>travelled</b> 2 mi from the Middlesex Filter Beds Weir, just below Lea Bridge; and passing to the east of the Navigation.|$|R
50|$|The {{ordnance}} is {{fitted with}} a fume extractor and a double-baffle muzzle brake. When travelling, the ordnance is held in position by a <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> that is mounted on the forward part of the glacis plate and this is remotely operated from the crew compartment.|$|R
50|$|The Sholef's 155mm/52 gun is an {{original}} design created by Soltam, though it bears a resemblance to South Africa's G5 Howitzer. It has a fume extractor and muzzle brake, and is kept stationary by a <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> while {{the vehicle is}} on the move. This gun has a maximum rate of fire of 9 rounds/min, and a range in excess of 40,000 m when firing an ERFB-BB round. Though loaded automatically, the gun may be cycled and fire manually if the need arises. While the gun is normally carried by a <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> as with most other self-propelled howitzers while the Sholef is on the move, the weapon is stabilized and can actually be used for direct-fire while the vehicle is moving, giving it much greater self-defense capability than most other vehicles of its type.|$|R
500|$|The {{pilot model}} was {{built at the}} Aberdeen Proving Ground in May 1942. The 57mm Gun M1 was mounted in the M12 recoil {{mechanism}} and installed on a tubular pedestal. The tubular pedestal was soon replaced with a conical structure that was designated the [...] "57mm gun mount T5". The gun on the pilot model had a traverse of 27.5 degrees {{either side of the}} centerline (total of 55 degrees), while having an elevation of +15 to -5 degrees. The short-barrelled (43 caliber) British Mark III 6-pounder gun was installed in the pilot, but the longer-barrelled (50 caliber) 57mm Gun M1 was specified for the production models. The original <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> – to hold the gun in a fixed position when the vehicle was moving – proved to be unsatisfactory, and was replaced by a <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> on the front hood.|$|R
50|$|As the forend {{reaches the}} rear and begins to move forward, the {{elevator}} lifts up the shell, lining {{it up with the}} barrel. As the bolt moves forward, the round slides into the chamber, and the final portion of the forend's <b>travel</b> <b>locks</b> the bolt into position. A pull of the trigger will fire the next round, where the cycle begins again.|$|R
50|$|Most {{swivel seats}} have a safety switch so the {{stairlift}} won’t move unless the seat is <b>locked</b> into its <b>travel</b> position. Special models with seats facing {{the bottom of}} the staircase have been produced for users with spinal or other conditions which prevent use of the conventional seat layout. More room is need on the landing with these special seats.|$|R
50|$|Next to {{the locks}} {{is the point}} at which the Wilts & Berks Canal left the Kennet and Avon. The Wilts & Berks is disused but the Wilts & Berks Canal Trust is {{restoring}} it. East of the <b>locks,</b> the canal <b>travels</b> across the 2004 Semington Aqueduct, built to allow the A350 to bypass Semington village. Another aqueduct carries the canal over Semington Brook.|$|R
50|$|When the Rosedale lock (Now lock 35 of the Trent-Severn Waterway) was {{completed}} in 1873, Coboconk became the furthest point one could travel from Lake Ontario. It remained as such for over three decades during a period when {{the construction of the}} Trent ceased due to political and financial turmoil. With the opening of the Kirkfield Lift <b>Locks</b> in 1907, <b>travel</b> beyond Coboconk became possible.|$|R
5000|$|Luggage locks {{accepted}} by the TSA can be opened by the authorities using publicly known universal [...] "master" [...] keys. Locks using this system are produced to meet standards set by Travel Sentry. Under agreement with the TSA, it is Travel Sentry that sets the standards for these locks and approves each design. Every <b>lock</b> with the <b>Travel</b> Sentry identifying mark (red diamond) is {{accepted by}} the TSA.|$|R
50|$|At Dukinfield Junction, the Peak Forest Canal {{turns to}} the left, but the South Pennine Ring {{continues}} straight ahead onto the Ashton Canal. The first half is level, until Fairfield Junction is reached. This was {{the point at which}} the Hollinwood Canal turned off. A short section of it now leads to a new marina, opened in 2008, and there are plans to reopen more of it. Between locks 10 and 11 is a short stub which used to be part of the Stockport Canal, for which there are also reopening plans. After descending through 18 <b>locks</b> and <b>travelling</b> 6.7 mi, the Ashton Canal arrives back at the starting point where it joins the Rochdale Canal at Ducie Street Junction.|$|R
50|$|Early IS-2s can be {{identified}} by the 'stepped' front hull casting with its small, opening driver's visor. The early tanks lacked gun tube <b>travel</b> <b>locks</b> or anti-aircraft machine guns and had narrow mantlets. According to Steven Zaloga, the IS-2 and Tiger I could knock each other out in normal combat distances below 1000 m. At any range, the performance of each tank against each other was dependent on the crew and combat situation.|$|R
50|$|In late 1944, the stepped hull {{front was}} {{replaced}} with an improved single casting of 120 mm thickness angled at 60 degrees. This new nose lacked the opening driver's visor. It is sometimes incorrectly {{referred to as the}} IS-2M, but that designation actually refers to a much later modernization program from the 1950s. Other minor upgrades included the addition of a <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> on the hull rear, wider mantlet and, on very late models, an anti-aircraft machine gun.|$|R
50|$|Other {{advances}} in design include adjustable travel, allowing riders {{to adapt the}} fork's travel to the specific terrain (e.g. less travel for uphill or paved sections, more travel for downhill sections). Many forks feature the ability to <b>lock</b> out the <b>travel.</b> This completely eliminates or drastically reduces the fork's travel for more efficient riding over smooth sections of terrain. The lockout can sometimes be remotely controlled by a lever on the handlebars via a mechanical cable, or even through electronics.|$|R
5000|$|Incorporated 27 Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) mid-life improvements. Most notably, {{the long}} barreled 155 mm M185 cannon {{in the new}} M178 gun mount, {{ballistic}} protection for the panoramic telescope, counterbalanced <b>travel</b> <b>lock,</b> {{and the ability to}} mount the M140 alignment device. Stowage increased from 28 rounds of 155 mm, to 36 rounds; [...]50cal ammunition remained at 500 rounds. During M109A2 production, a slightly simplified version was also produced for export. This had minor internal changes and deleted the hull flotation feature. These were designated M109A1B.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the main}} gun was {{intended}} to engage enemy armoured fighting vehicles it could only traverse 8° {{to the left and}} right, depress 15° and elevate 10°. A muzzle brake was fitted to reduce recoil forces and a <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> was fitted on the front deck to secure the gun during movement. For self-defense the crew carried three 9 mm machine pistols with 576 rounds of ammunition. A Selbstfahrlafetten-Zielfernrohr (Sfl.Z.F.) 1 sight was used by the gunner, a binocular Turmspähfernrohr (T.S.F.) periscope was fitted for use by the commander,and each loader was provided with a binocular Scherenfernrohr on a pivoting arm.|$|R
50|$|The Ausf. F {{tanks that}} {{received}} the new, longer, KwK 40 L/43 gun were temporary named Ausf. F2 (with the designation Sd.Kfz. 161/1). The tank increased in weight to 23.6 t. Differences between the Ausf. F1 and the Ausf. F2 were mainly {{associated with the}} change in armament, including an altered gun mantlet, internal <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> for the main weapon, new gun cradle, new Turmzielfernrohr 5f optic for the L/43 weapon, modified ammunition stowage, and discontinuing of the Nebelkerzenabwurfvorrichtung in favor of turret mounted Nebelwurfgeraet.

50|$|While many, if not all, of {{the refugee}} status {{applicants}} were rejected, the movement and its treatise with the Berlin senate continue to encourage refugees all around Europe during these difficult times for them. The movement contributed {{in the decision to}} shorten the Residenzpflicht’s locational <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> from 6 months to 3 months. In 2013, on the 1st of July, one of the Bundesländer, Thüringen, redefined the locational lock to be effective to the extense of its borders. Since then all other federal states in Germany, with the exception of Bavaria and Sachsen, have done the same.|$|R
50|$|The {{junction}} lies {{close to}} the northern portal of the Harecastle Tunnel. The Trent and Mersey Canal turns to the west after leaving the tunnel, and the Hall Green Branch initially turns off to the south. There is a sharp right-hand bend, after which it runs parallel to the main line, which descends through two locks. There is then another sharp right-hand bend, and the branch crosses over the main line on an aqueduct. The Macclesfield Canal is 26.1 mi long from the stop lock to Marple Junction, and ascends through a single flight of 12 locks, located 9 mi from the stop lock. Since both canals are now managed by British Waterways, the Hall Green Branch is usually considered {{to be part of}} the Macclesfield Canal. The summit level of the Trent and Mersey is 5.5 mi long, and ends {{close to the}} junction at <b>lock</b> 41. <b>Travelling</b> south, the other end of the summit is at lock 40, just after Etruria Junction, where the Caldon Canal joins the main line.|$|R
50|$|For travel, {{the gun is}} towed via a two-wheeled limber {{fitted to}} the end of the closed trails, with the spades removed and carried on each trail. Simple jacks on the trails just behind the main wheels are used to lift and support the closed trails so that the limber can be connected. The barrel and {{recuperator}} are pulled back between the closed trails and <b>locked</b> in a <b>travelling</b> position. There is a large bicycle chain arrangement on the right trail for this, and a compressed air cylinder, charged by the gun firing, is used to bring the barrel forward when the gun is brought back into action. It takes about four minutes to bring the gun into action, the normal detachment is eight strong.|$|R
5000|$|The {{gravity of}} body A {{produces}} a tidal force on B that distorts its gravitational equilibrium shape slightly {{so that it}} becomes elongated along the axis oriented toward A, and conversely, is slightly reduced in dimension in directions orthogonal to this axis. These distortions are known as tidal bulges. When B is not yet tidally <b>locked,</b> the bulges <b>travel</b> over its surface, {{with one of the}} two [...] "high" [...] tidal bulges traveling close to the point where body A is overhead. For large astronomical bodies that are nearly spherical due to self-gravitation, the tidal distortion produces a slightly prolate spheroid, i.e. an axially symmetric ellipsoid that is elongated along its major axis. Smaller bodies also experience distortion, but this distortion is less regular.|$|R
5000|$|Flight 981, named TC-JAV or [...] "Ship 29", {{had been}} ordered from McDonnell-Douglas {{three months after the}} service {{bulletin}} was issued, and was delivered to Turkish Airlines three months later. Despite this, the changes required by the service bulletin (installation of a support plate for the handle linkage, preventing the bending of the linkage seen in the Flight 96 incident) had not been implemented. Through either oversight or deliberate fraud, the manufacturer construction logs however showed that this work had been carried out. In reality, an improper adjustment had been made to the locking pin and warning light mechanism, causing the <b>locking</b> pin <b>travel</b> to be reduced. This meant that the pins did not extend past the torque tube flanges, allowing the handle to be closed without excessive force (estimated by investigators to be around [...] ) despite the improperly engaged latches. These findings concurred with statements made by Mohammed Mahmoudi, the baggage handler who had closed the door on Flight 981; he noted that no particular amount of force was needed to close the locking handle. Changes had also been made to the warning light switch, so that it would turn off the cockpit warning light even if the handle was not fully closed.|$|R
50|$|The 1978 Charles River Dam, located {{behind the}} TD Garden, {{controls}} {{the water level}} in the river basin. An earlier dam (see Charles River Dam Bridge), located beneath the Museum of Science, was completed in 1910 {{with the purpose of}} creating a fresh water river basin and riverfront park in Boston and Cambridge. As part of the dam construction, fill was added between the Longfellow Bridge and Charlesgate and dedicated as the Boston Embankment, now universally known as the Esplanade. The modern dam houses six pumps that provide flood control protection. The dam's <b>lock</b> system permits <b>travel</b> of recreational and commercial vessels from the river to the harbor year round. A fish passage allows for passage of anadromous fish (alewife, rainbow smelt and shad) during the migration season in late spring.|$|R
50|$|In 1861 Oliphant was {{appointed}} First Secretary of the British Legation in Japan under Minister Plenipotentiary (later Sir) Rutherford Alcock. He arrived in Edo {{at the end}} of June, but on the evening of 5 July a night-time attack was made on the legation by xenophobic ronin. His pistols having been <b>locked</b> in their <b>travelling</b> box, Oliphant rushed out with a hunting whip, and was attacked by a Japanese with a heavy two-handed sword. A beam, invisible in the darkness, interfered with the blows, but Oliphant was severely wounded and sent on board ship to recover. He had to return to England after a visit to Tsushima Island, where he discovered a Russian force occupying a secluded bay and obtained its withdrawal. The attack on the legation left him with permanent damage to one of his hands.|$|R
25|$|The {{main problem}} caused by locks is that, {{each time a}} lock goes through one fill-empty cycle, a lockful of water (tens of {{thousands}} up to millions of litres) is released to the lower pound. In more simplistic terms, on a canal where only one boat will fit into a <b>lock,</b> a boat <b>travelling</b> from the summit pound to the lowest pound is accompanied on its journey by one 'personal' lockful of water. A boat {{going the other way}} also transfers a lockful of water from the summit pound to the lowest pound. To prevent the canal from running dry, some method must be used to ensure that the water supply at the canal summit is constantly replenished at the rate that the water is being drained downwards. This is, of course much more of a problem on an artificial canal crossing a watershed than on a river navigation.|$|R
