5000|$|In {{predicate}} logic, {{a universal}} quantification {{is a type}} of quantifier, a <b>logical</b> <b>constant</b> which is interpreted as [...] "given any" [...] or [...] "for all". It expresses that a propositional function can be satisfied by every member of a domain of discourse. In other words, it is the predication of a property or relation to every member of the domain.

5000|$|In {{predicate}} logic, {{an existential}} quantification {{is a type}} of quantifier, a <b>logical</b> <b>constant</b> which is interpreted as [...] "there exists", [...] "there is at least one", or [...] "for some". Some sources use the term existentialization to refer to existential quantification. It is usually denoted by the turned E (∃) logical operator symbol, which, when used together with a predicate variable, is called an existential quantifier ("∃x" [...] or [...] "∃(x)"). Existential quantification is distinct from universal quantification ("for all"), which asserts that the property or relation holds for all members of the domain.|$|E

50|$|<b>Logical</b> <b>constants,</b> {{including}} <b>logical</b> connectives and quantifiers, can all {{be reduced}} conceptually to logical truth. For instance, two statements or more are logically incompatible if, and only if their conjunction is logically false. One statement logically implies another when it is logically incompatible with the negation of the other. A statement is logically true if, and only if its opposite is logically false. The opposite statements must contradict one another. In this way all logical connectives can be {{expressed in terms of}} preserving logical truth. The logical form of a sentence is determined by its semantic or syntactic structure and by the placement of <b>logical</b> <b>constants.</b> <b>Logical</b> <b>constants</b> determine whether a statement is a logical truth when they are combined with a language that limits its meaning.

50|$|The second {{approach}} is to treat the equality relation symbol as a <b>logical</b> <b>constant</b> that must be interpreted by the real equality relation in any interpretation. An interpretation that interprets equality this way {{is known as a}} normal model, so this second {{approach is}} the same as only studying interpretations that happen to be normal models. The advantage of this approach is that the axioms related to equality are automatically satisfied by every normal model, and so they {{do not need to be}} explicitly included in first-order theories when equality is treated this way. This second approach is sometimes called first order logic with equality, but many authors adopt it for the general study of first-order logic without comment.|$|E
5000|$|In {{predicate}} logic, what {{is described}} in layman's terms as [...] "something" [...] can more specifically be regarded as existential quantification, that is, the predication of a property or relation {{to at least one}} member of the domain.

[...] It expresses that a propositional function can be satisfied by at least one member of a domain of discourse. In other terms, it is the predication of a property or relation to at least one member of the domain.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Ruy de Queiroz {{has offered a}} {{reformulation}} of Martin-Löf type theory based on a novel reading of Wittgenstein’s [...] "meaning-is-use", where the explanation {{of the consequences of}} a given proposition gives the meaning to the <b>logical</b> <b>constant</b> dominating the proposition. This amounts to a non-dialogical interpretation of logical constants via the effect of elimination rules over introduction rules, which finds a parallel in Paul Lorenzen's and Jaakko Hintikka's dialogue/game-semantics. This led to a type theory called [...] "Meaning as Use Type Theory". In reference to the use of Wittgenstein's dictum, he has shown that the aspect concerning the explanation of the consequences of a proposition is present since a very early date when in a letter to Bertrand Russell, where Wittgenstein refers to the universal quantifier only having meaning when one sees what follows from it.|$|E

This helps to some extent {{but there is still}} a problem in terms of identifying how the different propositions shared by the two speakers are specifically related to each other. Dummett's proposal is based on an analogy from logic. To understand a logically complex sentence it is necessary to understand one that is logically less complex. In this manner, the distinction between logically less complex sentences that are constitutive of the meaning of a <b>logical</b> <b>constant</b> and logically more complex sentences that are not takes {{on the role of the}} old analytic/synthetic distinction. [...] "The comprehension of a sentence in which the <b>logical</b> <b>constant</b> does not figure as a principal operator depends on the comprehension of the constant, but does not contribute to its constitution."

[...] This is, in turn, explained by giving the rules of introduction for simple schemes such as [...] and [...]To comprehend a sentence is to comprehend all and only the sentences of less logical complexity than the sentence that one is trying to comprehend.However, there is still a problem with extending this approach to natural languages.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the formal theory of first-order fuzzy logic in narrow sense (FLn), namely its form with {{evaluated}} syntax since in our opinion, it might serve as a pivotal fuzzy logic. It has been presented in many papers (see, e. g. [6]) and in details is explained in the book [10]. Note that {{from the point of}} metamathematics presented in the book [2], it is a specific logical system (called there Rational Pavelka logic) which extends Lukasiewicz logic. The truth values are therefore taken from the interval [0; 1] and the system of basic logical connectives is the Lukasiewicz one. Its specific feature is introduction of symbols for all truth values (called <b>logical</b> <b>constants)</b> into the language. Though we work with <b>logical</b> <b>constants</b> for all the truth values, its has been demonstrated (for example in [9]) that only rational <b>logical</b> <b>constants</b> are necessary and the rest {{can be used as a}} significant technical, though dispensable, means.

40|$|The {{philosophical}} {{discussion about}} <b>logical</b> <b>constants</b> {{has only recently}} moved into the substructural era. While philosophers {{have spent a lot}} of time discussing the meaning of <b>logical</b> <b>constants</b> in the context of classical versus intuitionistic logic, very little has been said about the introduction of substruc-tural connectives. Linear logic, affine logic and other substructural logics offer a more ﬁne-grained perspective on basic connectives such as conjunction and disjunction, a perspective which I believe will also shed light on debates in the philosophy of logic. In what follows I will look at one particularly interesting instance of this: The development of the position known as logical inferentialism in view of substructural connectives. I claim that sensitivity to structural properties is an interesting challenge to logical inferentialism, and that it ultimately requires revision of core notions in the inferentialist litera-ture. Speciﬁcally, I want to argue that current deﬁnitions of proof theoretic harmony give rise to problematic nonconservativeness as a result of their insensitivity to substructurality. These nonconservativeness results are undesirable because they make it impossible to consistently add <b>logical</b> <b>constants</b> that are of independent philosophical interest. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the metaphysics of logic. I argue against a view I refer to as 'logical realism’. This is {{the view that the}} <b>logical</b> <b>constants</b> {{represent}} a particular kind of metaphysical structure, which I dub ‘logico-metaphysical structure’. I argue instead for a more metaphysically lightweight view of logic which I dub ‘logical expressivism’. In {{the first part of this}} thesis (Chapters I and II) I argue against a number of arguments that Theodore Sider has given for logical realism. In Chapter I, I present an argument of his to the effect that logico-metaphysical structure provides the only good explanation of the semantic determinacy of the <b>logical</b> <b>constants.</b> I argue that other explanations are possible. In Chapter II, I present another argument of his to the effect that logico-metaphysical structure is something that comes along with ontological realism: the view that there is a non-language-relative fact of the matter about what exists. I argue that the connection between logical and ontological realism is not as close as Sider makes it out to be. In the second part of this thesis (Chapters III – V) I set out a positive view of the <b>logical</b> <b>constants</b> that can explain both why their meanings are semantically determinate, and why they form part of our vocabulary. On that view, the primary bearers of logical structure are propositional attitudes, and the <b>logical</b> <b>constants</b> are in our language as vehicles for the expression of logically complex propositional attitudes. In Chapter III, I set out an expressivist theory of propositional logic. In Chapter IV, I use this theory to explain how the logical connectives end up having determinate meanings. In Chapter V, I extend the expressivist theory to predicate logic...|$|R
