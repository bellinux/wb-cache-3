5|$|D.C. United and {{the city}} signed a final {{construction}} agreement on June 8. The agreement required that the facility seat a minimum of 17,000 people, and established the term of the lease at 30 years for a minimal $1 per year. The agreement also contained a clause governing land: If the cost of land acquisition rose above $150 million, D.C. United was required to reimburse the city 50 percent of the excess (although the club's commitment was capped at $10 million). The club was also barred from playing more than an occasional home game away from the Buzzard Point stadium, prohibiting the team from relocating during the term of the lease. Mayor Bowser then submitted the agreement, as well as <b>land</b> <b>purchase</b> agreements and a revised developer agreement, to the City Council for approval; the council approved the <b>land</b> <b>purchase</b> agreements on June 30, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Although Disston's {{engineered}} canals aided {{water transport}} and steamboat traffic in Florida, he was ultimately unsuccessful in draining the Kissimmee River floodplain or lowering the surface water around Lake Okeechobee {{and in the}} Everglades. He was forced to sell much of his investments {{at a fraction of}} their original costs. However, his <b>land</b> <b>purchase</b> primed Florida's economy and allowed railroad magnates Henry Flagler and Henry Plant to build rail lines down the east coast of Florida, and another joining the west coast, which directly led to the domination of the tourist and citrus industries in Florida. Disston's immediate impact was in the Philadelphia area, where he was active in Republican politics and a philanthropist, but his legacy is often associated with the draining and development of Florida.|$|E
5|$|For the 1903 {{parliamentary}} session, the UERL announced {{bills for}} the BS and its other tube railways, seeking permission to merge the three companies by transferring the BS's and CCE's powers to the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP). The BS bill also included requests {{for a further}} extension of time and for powers to compulsorily purchase land for an electrical sub-station at Lambeth. The merger was rejected by Parliament, but the <b>land</b> <b>purchase</b> and extension of time were permitted separately in the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1903 and the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (Extension of Time) Act, 1903, both given royal assent on 11 August 1903.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} years, {{many of the}} proprietors {{pulled out of the}} real estate market and voluntarily sold their property to the government so that sale to the land's occupiers could be facilitated. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian Confederation. One of the terms of the Island joining the Confederation was the sale of the estates of land to their occupiers. The agreement to join the Confederation contained a clause outlining the possibility that the federal government of Canada could provide a grant of up to CA$800,000 to the provincial government to facilitate the purchase of the land from the proprietors. In 1875, through 'The Commissioners Appointed Under The Provisions of The <b>Land</b> <b>Purchase</b> Act, 1875' all of the outstanding proprietor-owned land was compulsorily purchased by the provincial government, at rates decided by a 'Commission of Enquiry'.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Great Depression, Silverman's travels {{expanded}} in the 1930s, {{when she began}} spending 6 months each year outside the U.S. As early as 1932, <b>land</b> <b>purchase</b> programs to buy and settle refugees on permanent homes in Palestine were being pursued by Jewish organizations. Silverman not only supported the plans and raised funds for them, but she planted the first tree in the colony at Wady Havarith. With Hitler's rise to power, Silverman's pleas for {{a safe haven for}} Jews became more urgent and her first-hand reports from Germany, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Lithuania, and Poland contained explicit accounts of conditions. In 1938, Silverman was working with the Youth Aliyah Movement in conjunction with Hadassah in the U.S. to relocate 10,000 refugee children to Palestine. As a fund-raiser, Silverman's goal was to raise {{a quarter of a million}} dollars for resettlement and youth training in agricultural and vocational pursuits. In 1939, she ended her Polish tour studying the conditions and desperation, shortly before the Polish invasion, but the effort was successful in relocating some 7,000 young people from Poland, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Romania to Palestine before the end of 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was constructed pursuant {{to an agreement}} between the General Services Administration (GSA) and Boston developer David Nassif, Sr. In July 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson began planning to unite various disparate transportation agencies into a new United States Department of Transportation. GSA (the property owner and manager for the U.S. federal government) began seeking to lease or build a structure to house the new agency in late 1965. Donald T. Kirwan, chief of GSA's leasing division, knew Nassif from a previous lease negotiation, and discussed with him the siting of a building and its size. Nassif approached the RLA on April 21, 1966, and asked to buy the newly razed block of land bounded by 6th, 7th, D, and E Streets SW. In May 1967, GSA {{sent a letter to}} Nassif advising him that it was likely to lease the entire structure he intended to build. The $5.9 million <b>land</b> <b>purchase</b> was finalized on October 30, 1967. The cost of the structure is unclear. On November 15, 1967, Nassif had secured a $39 million construction loan. But The Washington Post pegged the cost of the building at $27 million in July 1968. The newspaper said in August 1970 that the cost of the structure was $26.5 million. The {{building was}} designed by architect Edward Durrell Stone, who also designed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. On April 11, 1968, GSA leased the entire building from Nassif for 20 years for $98 million. John A. Volpe Construction was the chief contractor.|$|E

25|$|UIL {{agitation}} by tenant farmers {{continued to}} press for compulsory <b>land</b> <b>purchase</b> and resulted in the calling of the December 1902 Land Conference, an initiative by moderate landlords led by Lord Dunraven {{on the one hand}} and William O'Brien, John Redmond MP, Timothy Harrington MP and Ulster's T. W. Russell MP representing tenant farmers on the other hand. It strove for a settlement by conciliatory agreement between landlord and tenant. After six sittings all eight tenant's demands were conceded, O'Brien having guided the official nationalist movement into endorsement of a new policy of conciliation. He followed this by campaigning vigorously for the greatest piece of social legislation Ireland had yet seen, orchestrating the Wyndham <b>Land</b> <b>Purchase</b> Act (1903) through Parliament. The Act provided very generous bonus subsidy terms to landowners on sale.|$|E
