Generally, the CUACE model had good performance of the concentration simulation of pollutants. The model simulation has been improved by using HTSVE.

In the Philippines, most existing studies and emission inventories have mainly focused on point and mobile sources, while research involving human exposures {{to particulate}} pollutants is rare. This paper presents a method for estimating the amount of fine particulate (PM 2. 5) emissions in a test study site {{in the city of}} Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, in the Philippines, by utilizing <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>factors,</b> regionally procured data, and land cover/land use (activity data) interpreted from satellite imagery. Geographic information system (GIS) software was used to map the estimated emissions in the study area. The present results suggest that vehicular emissions from motorcycles and tricycles, as well as fuels used by households (charcoal) and burning of agricultural waste, largely contribute to PM 2. 5 emissions in Cabanatuan.

To simulate real-world vehicle emissions accurately, the road has been divided into segments according to the driving cycle (traffic speed) on this road segment. The {{results show that the}} vehicle emissions of NO x, CO, HC and PM were 10. 54  [*]×[*]  10 4, 42. 51  [*]×[*]  10 4 and 2. 13  [*]×[*]  10 4 and 0. 41  [*]×[*]  10 4  Mg respectively. The vehicle emissions and fuel consumption estimated by the model were compared with the China Vehicle Emission Control Annual Report and fuel sales thereafter. The grid-based emissions were also compared with the vehicular emission inventory developed by the macro-scale approach. This method indicates that the bottom-up approach better estimates the levels and spatial distribution of vehicle emissions than the macro-scale method, which relies on more information.

40|$|The Region of Western Macedonia in Greece {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{polluted}} areas in Europe due to large lignite ¿ fired power plants with total installed capacity of approx. 4500 MW. The determination of <b>emissions</b> and <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> for the region is an essential part of the EU-supported project SMAQ, aimed at developing methods for optimizing pollution abatement plans and for early warning of extreme pollution incidents. Using various data sources and the CORINAIR methodology, <b>emissions</b> and <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> have been estimated for the main industrial and non-industrial activities in that region. Biogenic sources such as animal husbandry and agricultural activities have been examined as well. The particular source sectors examined include power plants, lignite mining, road transport, central heating systems and agriculture. Calculated <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> are based on data from the local pollution sources, while default values from CORINAIR or other sources are used to fill existing data gaps. An emissions inventory concerning major pollutants (PM, SO 2, NOx, CO, N 2 O, VOC, CH 4, NH 3) was compiled for the period 2001 ¿ 2004. As expected, the most significant pollutants are SO 2 and NOx, followed by PM and CO, emitted from power plants. However, CO emissions due to road transportation are also quite significant.

International Vehicle Emissions (IVE) model was applied by specifying the year 2010 as a base case and the target year of 2020 as Business as Usual (BAU). The parking lot survey, GPS monitoring and MC counting on selected roads during weekday and weekend were conducted. Fuel switching from gasoline octane number 91 to gasohol in all MC fleet in the municipality was set as a scenario according to current Thailand’s transport energy policies. Total pollution emissions reduction of the following pollutants after switching to gasohol E 10 (10 % of ethanol) for all MC in the fleet compared to BAU were obtained: benzene (86 %), 1, 3 -butadiene (69 %), VOC (including evaporation) (31 %) and CO (29 %), while the following pollutants increased: acetaldehydes (> 100 %), formaldehydes (51 %), NOx (9 %) and PM (5 %). Gasohol use scenario produced larger amount of CO 2 (29 %) and CH 4 (9 %).

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{has been}} one of the priorities issues in the environmental awareness, especially in cities from developing countries. Transport sector has an important contribution to the urban air quality degradation in these countries. Hence the importance to develop traffic emission inventories in order to allow the identification and quantification of atmospheric pollutant emissions in a defined area. The aim of this work is to develop a traffic emission inventory for the city of Querétaro, Mexico, using two different approaches (top-down and bottom-up) and to compare the results obtained from using both methodologies. Vehicle emissions from top-down inventory for the state of Querétaro show an increase compared to vehicle emissions reported in the 1999 Mexican National Emission Inventory due to the accelerated growth and development of the city of Querétaro. Emissions from the municipalities located in the south of the state of Querétaro are higher than in the rest of the municipalities, probably due to the higher number of highways and roads existing in this area. Vehicle emissions from bottom-up inventory using IVE model and considering different type of roads show that arterial roads are the main contributors of emission due to vehicle activity, followed by highways, second arterial roads, and local roads. The comparison of the two methodologies shows that CO emissions from bottomup inventory are higher than CO emissions from top-down inventory. One of the possible reasons for having this behaviour is due to the default parameters used by IVE model which might cause an overestimation of CO emissions. In order to have a better understanding of this difference further analysis of the default parameters used by IVE model should be considered. <b>Local</b> <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> and traffic measurements are strongly recommended to be used in IVE model in order to improve vehicle emission estimations.

40|$|The Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy initiative, {{hereafter}} called “Covenant” or “CoM”, {{brings together}} {{local and regional}} authorities voluntarily committing to develop and implement a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) containing measures to reduce their energy (and non-energy) related Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Within the CoM 2010 guidebook ‘How to develop a Sustainable Energy Action Plan’ (Bertoldi et al., 2010), Part II focuses on the compiling of <b>local</b> GHG <b>emission</b> inventories in the 28 Member States of the European Union (EU). This technical report provides an update of the CoM default <b>emission</b> <b>factors,</b> reported in Part II of the CoM 2010 guidebook and subsequently revised (CoM, 2014; CoM, 2016), together with information on the methodologies, assumptions and data sources, as well as recommendations for their application to the calculation of CO 2 and GHG (CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O) <b>emissions</b> due to <b>local</b> use or production of energy (fuel, municipal wastes, renewable energy sources (RES), electricity). As for previous versions, the CoM default <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> - Version 2017 (expressed in tCO 2 or CO 2 equivalent/MWh), to be used to estimate standard direct emissions are the IPCC (2006) default factors for stationary combustion for the energy carriers and RES, the most commonly used in the European Union. The CoM default <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> to estimate <b>local</b> <b>emissions</b> using the Life Cycle Assessment approach, which also includes emissions from the entire supply chain, have been updated using the lastest version (v 3. 2) of the European Life Cycle Database, as well as other Life Cycle databases and literature reviews. For indirect <b>emissions</b> from <b>local</b> consumption of electricity, national and EU annual factors have been calculated for the 1990 to 2013, using an updated methodological approach and an extended set of energy data (IEA, 2016). The GHG <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> (in tCO 2 -eq/MWh) have been estimated using the 100 -year time horizon Global Warming Potential factors from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC, 2007), which are the ones currently recommended to the EU countries for the national inventory reporting, in the frame of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 	Regular updates of CoM default <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> are foreseen for the future. New CoM signatories are therefore recommended to use the latest version of Annex I available from the Covenant on-line library. It is important to note is that the <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> used to calculate emission inventories should be consistent for the entire implementation process of the SECAP. In particular, since more recent knowledge and technologies can give substantial changes, it is strongly recommended when opting for the use of CoM default <b>emission</b> <b>factors,</b> not to modify the ones applied to the Baseline Emission Inventory during the monitoring phase, in order to identify the trends and changes in <b>local</b> <b>emissions</b> that are due to local energy production and consumption. When selecting the CoM default <b>emission</b> <b>factors,</b> {{it is also important to}} ensure that they are appropriate to local fuel quality and composition. If local authorities prefer to use <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> that better reflect the properties of the fuels used in their territory for the calculation and update of their <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> inventories, they are welcome to do so, when more country specific or local data are available and reliable.

40|$|Biomass burning is an {{important}} contributor to global total emissions of NO x (NO + NO 2). Generally bottom-up fire emissions models calculate NO x emissions by multiplying fuel consumption estimates with static biome specific <b>emission</b> <b>factors,</b> defined in units of grams of NO per kilogram of dry matter consumed. <b>Emission</b> <b>factors</b> are {{a significant source of}} uncertainty in bottom-up fire emissions modeling because relatively few observations are available to characterize the large spatial and temporal variability of burning conditions. In this paper we use NO 2 tropospheric column observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) from the year 2005 over South America to calculate monthly NO x <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> for four fire types: deforestation, savanna/grassland, woodland, and agricultural waste burning. In general, the spatial trends in NO x <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> calculated in this work are consistent with <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> derived from in situ measurements from the region, but are more variable than published biome specific global average <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> widely used in bottom up fire emissions inventories such as the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) v 3. Satellite based NO x <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> also indicate substantial temporal variability in burning conditions. Overall, we found that deforestation fires have the lowest NO x <b>emission</b> <b>factors,</b> on average 30 % lower than the <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> used in GFED v 3. Agricultural fire NO x <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> were the highest, on average a factor of 2 higher than GFED v 3 values.

In these studies, <b>emissions</b> <b>factors</b> were assumed to reduce annually, due to an increase in the proportion of renewable energy sources for electricity generation. However, short-term (e.g. daily) variations of <b>emissions</b> <b>factors</b> were not considered.

Moreover, inaccurate <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> used in the calculation of annual emissions inventories led to the identification of cotton harvesting as {{a significant source of}} PM 10 in California and Arizona. As a result, cotton growers in these states are now required to obtain air quality permits and submit management practice plans detailing the actions taken by the producer to reduce fugitive PM emissions from field operations. The objective of this work was to develop accurate PM <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> for cotton harvesting in terms of total suspended particulate (TSP), PM 10, and PM 2. 5. Two protocols were developed and used to develop PM <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> from cotton harvesting operations on three farms in Texas during 2006 and 2007. Protocol one utilized TSP concentrations measured downwind of harvesting operations with meteorological data measured onsite in a dispersion model to back-calculate TSP emission flux values. Flux values, determined with the regulatory dispersion models ISCST 3 and AERMOD, were converted to <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> and corrected with results from particle size distribution (PSD) analyses to report <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> in terms of PM 10 and PM 2. 5. <b>Emission</b> <b>factors</b> were developed for two-row (John Deere 9910) and sixrow (John Deere 9996) cotton pickers with protocol one.

First, the <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> for pumping water in buildings is determined using published values for operating performances. About half of the residential dwellings in Japan are multistory apartments, and these apartments use pumps for the delivery of water. The <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> of pumping is calculated as 0. 69 kg CO 2 /m 3, which adds 16 % to the <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> of waterworks and sewer systems. Next, the CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> of rainwater and reclaimed water are calculated for different water delivery cases in buildings. As a result, it is found that the use of reclaimed water increases CO 2 emissions by 62 %, compared to the use of ordinary water...|$|R

This is a challenge when authorities need to decide on <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> for inclusion in national emission inventories. In these inventories, <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> need to be representative on a national level and include firing habits and technology in use. Herein lies a considerable challenge, resulting in large uncertainties {{for a number of}} the <b>emission</b> <b>factors.</b> In addition, value chain analysis is becoming increasingly common to assess the influence of the different elements in the value chain on different impact factors or stressors. For the wood stove value chain, the conversion element, i. e. the combustion process and the resulting emissions, is most important for most of the impact factors. It is essential for the outcome of such analyses that the best available <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> are {{used to be able to}} assess the current impact of these as well as the improvement potential. Hence, it becomes increasingly important to select or derive representative <b>emission</b> <b>factors,</b> at a sufficient detailing level.

40|$|Three {{years of}} aerosol {{particle}} number concentrations (PNCs), size distributions and vertical particle fluxes {{measured at the}} semi-urban SMEAR III station in Helsinki, Finland, were studied. The purpose is to study the <b>local</b> <b>emission</b> sources and their effect on particle concentrations and size distributions. By means of cluster analysis, six representative size distributions were identified. Their occurrence together with particle concentrations and fluxes were found to vary significantly with wind direction. Lower particle concentrations and fluxes were measured downwind from vegetated and residential areas compared to directions where the measurement site is downwind from roads passing near the measurement site. For these directions, contributions of the local sources on the measured particle concentrations and size distributions were evident. In particular, size distributions with a mode in the size range 20 &#x 2013; 40 nm {{were found to be}} more affected by <b>local</b> traffic <b>emissions,</b> whereas the mode shifted towards larger sizes when contribution from distant sources was more evident. Using flux footprint functions, mixed vehicle fleet <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> (EFs) were derived from the particle flux measurements. EFs of 6. 03 (&#x 00 B 1; 0. 19) 1014 &#x 0023; Veh&#x 2212; 1 km&#x 2212; 1 and 3. 65 (&#x 00 B 1; 0. 12) 1014 &#x 0023; Veh&#x 2212; 1 km&#x 2212; 1 were estimated for cold (October&#x 2013;March) and warm (April&#x 2013;September) periods, respectively. <b>Emission</b> <b>factors</b> increased with decreasing air temperature (T) following a linear relationship EF=&#x 2212; 0. 201014 &#x 0023; Veh&#x 2212; 1 km&#x 2212; 1 &#x 00 B 0;C&#x 2212; 1 T+ 6. 981014 &#x 0023; Veh&#x 2212; 1 km&#x 2212; 1 (RMSE= 3. 71014 &#x 0023; Veh&#x 2212; 1 km&#x 2212; 1) ...|$|R
30|$|The <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> {{specifies}} {{how much}} greenhouse gases are emitted {{into the atmosphere}} generating one kWh of electric energy. Other greenhouse gases than CO 2 are converted into CO 2 equivalents. Table  1 also contains the share of total generation sg of generation technology g of all considered technologies G. There are gross <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> that {{take into account the}} entire production chain and net <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> that only consider emissions from the burned fuel. Gross <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> f_g^g [g/kWh_el] also include the emissions from upstream and downstream process chains. We used the mean of the interval given in Wagner et al. (2007) as the <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> fg for generation technology g. For other renewables, pump storage, and other non-renewables no <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> was given. However, their contributions to the total generation in Germany are very low (see Table  1). For this technologies we assume f_g^g to be the the average annual <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> of the same year as in Wagner et al. (2007) being 621 g/kWhel (2017). The negative <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> of biomass results from fuel savings through co-generation and because the rotting of biomass would produce methane that is more climate-damaging than the CO 2 released during combustion (Wagner et al. 2007). For the calculations we used the net <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> f_n^g from Ensslen et al. (2017) that only considers the emissions from fuels burned during generation. This is based on the notion that the temporal flexibility only has no immediate effect on the generation structure.|$|R

Seasonal <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> for grassland fires correlate linearly with {{the proportion of}} green grass, used as a surrogate for the fuel moisture content, and are higher for products of incomplete combustion {{in the early part}} of the dry season compared with later in the dry season. Models of <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> for NMHC and PM(sub 2. 5) versus modified combustion efficiency (MCE) are statistically different in grassland compared with woodland ecosystems. We compare predictions based on the integration of <b>emissions</b> <b>factors</b> from this study, from the southern African Fire-Atmosphere Research Initiative 1992 (SAFARI- 92), and from SAFARI- 2000 with those based on the smaller set of ecosystem-specific <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> to estimate the effects of using regional-average rather than ecosystem-specific <b>emission</b> <b>factors.</b> We also test the validity of using the SAFARI- 92 models for <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> versus MCE to predict the early dry season <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> measured in this study. The comparison indicates that the largest discrepancies occur at the low end (0. 907) and high end (0. 972) of MCE values measured in this study. Finally, we combine our models of MCE versus proportion of green grass for grassland fires with <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> versus MCE for selected oxygenated volatile organic compounds measured in the SAFARI- 2000 campaign to derive the first seasonal <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> for these compounds. The results of this study demonstrate that seasonal variations in savanna fire emissions are important and should be considered in modeling emissions at regional to continental scales...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} tackle climate change effectively, the {{greenhouse}} gas emissions produced in Korea should be assessed precisely. To do so, the nation needs to accumulate country-specific data reflecting the specific circumstances surrounding Korea’s emissions. This paper analyzed element contents of domestic anthracite, calorific value, and concentration of methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) in the exhaust gases from circulating fluidized bed plant. The findings showed the concentration of CH 4 and N 2 O in the flue gas to be 1. 85 and 3. 25 [*]ppm, respectively, and <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> were 0. 486 and 2. 198 [*]kg/TJ, respectively. The CH 4 <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> in this paper was 52 % lower than default <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> presented by the IPCC. The N 2 O <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> {{was estimated to be}} 46 % higher than default <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> presented by the IPCC. This discrepancy can be attributable to the different methods and conditions of combustion because the default <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> suggested by IPCC take only fuel characteristics into consideration without combustion technologies. Therefore, Korea needs to facilitate research on a legion of fuel and energy consumption facilities to develop country-specific <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> so that the nation can have a competitive edge in the international climate change convention in the years to come...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{estimation}} of emissions largely {{depends on the}} quality of <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> used for calculation. The study on the {{estimation of}} <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> is important for calculating the emission of air pollutants from road traffic in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). The result of this study is the selection of a suitable method and tracer for estimating <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> of 15 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from C 2 -C 6 and NOx from road traffic in HCMC. The survey has been carried out in 3 / 2 Street, District 10, HCMC from January to March 2007. Three VOCs compounds with high average <b>emission</b> <b>factors</b> are hexane (59, 7 ± 9, 2 mg/km. veh.), iso-pentane (52, 7 ± 7, 4 mg/km. veh.) and 3 -methylpentane (36, 1 ± 3, 6 mg/km. veh.) and the average <b>emission</b> <b>factor</b> of NOx is 0, 20 ± 0, 03 g/km. veh.
