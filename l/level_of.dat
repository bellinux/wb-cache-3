German economist Hans-Werner Sinn noted in 2012 that Ireland was the only country that had implemented relative wage moderation {{in the last five}} years, which helped decrease its relative price/wage levels by 16%.

A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised <b>level</b> <b>of</b> total cholesterol, markedly raised <b>level</b> <b>of</b> low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal <b>level</b> <b>of</b> high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal <b>level</b> <b>of</b> triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350–550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650–1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E

In collecting the information, thirty four full-time teachers in a Catholic school in Yogyakarta Indonesia are asked to evaluate the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> participation they actually have experienced. The gap between the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> participation they wanted and the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> participation they actually have experienced express their <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> satisfaction to their <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> participation. Moreover, the teacher respondents are also asked to evaluate the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> Organizational Health they perceived. The result of the study show that the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> participation, both teachers' desired participation and actual participation are not always significantly correlated to the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> Organizational Health they perceive. Such significant relationship between the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> participation and the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> Organizational Health only occur in some areas of decision making and some dimensions of Organizational Health. In addition, satisfied teachers and dissatisfied teachers are not always different in their perception <b>of</b> the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> Organizational Health.

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} the potential predictive value of cathepsins B, D and K {{in a series}} of 51 adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas. While almost always benign, craniopharyngiomas exhibit a high propensity to recur postsurgically and biological markers are therefore needed to predict their recurrence. We have previously demonstrated the potential predictive value of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) (Lefranc et al. J. Neurosurg. 2003; 98; 145 - 153). METHODS AND RESULTS: Computer-assisted microscopy was used to determine quantitatively the immunohistochemical <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression of the alpha, beta and gamma RAR subtypes and cathepsins B, D and K. The <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression of cathepsin D and of cathepsin B correlated significantly with the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression <b>of</b> RARbeta. The <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression of cathepsin K correlated significantly with the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression of RARgamma. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas are characterized by low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> RARbeta and high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> RARgamma. The tendency to recurrence seems, at least partly, to relate to the fact that (i) craniopharyngiomas with low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> RARbeta express low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cathepsin D, and (ii) craniopharyngiomas with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> RARgamma express high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cathepsin K.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} {{study was to examine the}} {{relationship}} between <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias and <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction. Additionally, this study aimed to investigate whether there are gender differences in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction, and whether there are gender differences in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias. There were 35 participants in this study (15 males and 20 females). The Participants were aged between 18 and 29. Each participant was examined on an individual basis throughout the course of one month. Participants were asked to complete an Implicit Associations Test (Weight IAT-bodies) to measure <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias and the Body Image Satisfaction Scale (BISS) to measure <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction. Hypothesis 1 stated that lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction were related to higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias against overweight individuals. Hypothesis 1 was not supported as results showed that there was an extremely weak, negative relationship. Hypothesis 2 stated that females score lower on <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction than males. Hypothesis 2 was supported as data from the study showed that females scored lower than males on <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction. Hypothesis 3 stated that females score higher on <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias than males. There was no significant difference found between males and females in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias. However, as hypothesized, females scored higher than males on <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias. It is recommended that future research obtains a larger sample in order to possibly find a significant difference between males and females. These findings also suggest that the relationship between high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias and low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction may only exist among obese individuals. Findings from the current study have implications for knowledge of gender differences in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction. Additionally, findings from the current study contribute towards research into <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> implicit weight bias among 18 - 29 year olds and how it can affect <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body satisfaction. These findings also further highlight the prevalence of implicit weight bias...|$|R
50|$|Higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA {{have been}} linked to higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> some mental health difficulties. For instance, it has been shown that, among {{university}} students, higher FA is associated with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> schizotypy. Depression scores {{have been found to be}} higher in men, but not women, with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA. One study by Shackelford and Larsen found that men and women with higher facial asymmetry reported more physiological complaints than those with lower facial asymmetry, and that both men and women with higher asymmetry experienced higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> psychological distress overall. For example, men with higher facial asymmetry experienced higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> depression compared to men with lower facial asymmetry. Fluctuating asymmetry has also been studied in relation to psychopathy. One study looking at offenders and non-offenders found that, although offenders had higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA overall, psychopathic offenders had lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA compared to offenders who did not meet the criteria for psychopathy. Additionally, offenders with the highest <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> psychopathy were found to have similar <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA to non-offenders.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{addressed}} {{the relationships among}} professional efficacy, emotional exhaustion, and job characteristics (job demands and job control) {{in the context of}} a two-wave panel study among 828 Dutch police officers. Based on the demand-control model, we expected that high demands/high control would be positively related to professional efficacy, and that high demands/low control would be related to high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion. Moreover, we hypothesized that high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion would lead to lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> professional efficacy and that high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> efficacy would lead to low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion. Structural equation modelling largely supported these predictions. High demands were longitudinally related to high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> efficacy and high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion; high control was longitudinally related to high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> efficacy. Further, efficacy and exhaustion were indeed mutually related. Finally, high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion were longitudinally related to high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> demands. We conclude that there are complex, yet theoretically, and practically interpretable relations among efficacy, strain and work characteristics. © 2010 The British Psychological Society...|$|R

50|$|Research has linked higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> {{fluctuating}} asymmetry (FA) to poorer {{outcomes in}} some domains of physical health in humans. For example, {{one study found}} that individuals with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA report a higher number of medical conditions than those with lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA. However, they did not experience worse outcomes in areas such as systolic blood pressure or cholesterol <b>levels.</b> Higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA have also been linked to higher body mass index (BMI) in women, and lower BMI in men. Research has shown that both men and women with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA, both facial and bodily, report a higher number of respiratory infections and a higher number of days ill, compared to men and women with lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA. In men, higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA have been linked to lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> physical attractiveness and higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> oxidative stress, regardless <b>of</b> smoking or <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> toxin exposure.

Additionally, the researcher examined what types of coping skills were utilized in the face <b>of</b> high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> uncontrollable stress. Lastly, a moderational model was proposed, wherein active coping was hypothesized to strengthen the inverse relationship between uncontrollable stress and subjective well-being. Results revealed that higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> uncontrollable stress were related to higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> negative affect. Additionally, the use of active and adaptive coping strategies was associated with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> positive affect and life satisfaction. Adaptive coping was associated with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> maladaptive coping. As expected, maladaptive coping was predictive <b>of</b> lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> subjective well-being. Lastly, youth who reported employing higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> active coping appeared to have more stable <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> negative affect than youth who reported employing lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> active coping. These results highlight the importance of tailoring prevention programs to urban youth, who are often faced with notably high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> uncontrollable stress and may need support related to applying coping skills in their lives. Additionally, this research sheds light on the importance of addressing the value of resiliency in urban youth populations...|$|R
