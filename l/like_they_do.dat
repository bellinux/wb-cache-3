During the course of the study, the researchers gave a few select males vasectomies just before mating season. The male birds behaved <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> every season, establishing territory, finding a mate, and attempting to make baby birds. Despite apparent social monogamy, the female birds whose partners were surgically altered still became pregnant, indicating that overt social monogamy did not predict for sexual fidelity. These babies were cared for by their sterile adoptive fathers.|$|E
25|$|However {{word order}} isn't {{a subject of}} {{intonation}} only. Different word orders often have different meanings in Lithuanian. There are also some strict rules and some tendencies in using different word placing. For example, a word that provides new information (rheme, or comment) has tendency to be postponed after other words, but not always {{to the end of}} the sentence. Adjectives precede nouns <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> in English, but order of adjectives in an adjective group is different from in English. If the main word order is followed, a temporal, locative or causal adjunct is put at the beginning of the sentence, while adjuncts of other types go directly before the verb and its objects (see the SVO rule above).|$|E

500|$|Series co-creators, Dan Povenmire and Swampy Marsh, {{wrote the}} story for [...] "Flop Starz;" [...] Sherm Cohen and Antoine Guilbaud, meanwhile, {{constructed}} the storyboards.

Povenmire and Marsh wrote the featured song, [...] "Gitchee Gitchee Goo," [...] <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> with all of the music in the show.

500|$|Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane {{explained}} that the reason they made a parody of Star Wars in particular was because the show's staff members were huge fans of the films. They also chose Star Wars because Lucasfilm allowed it. MacFarlane stated that creating parodies based on Raiders of the Lost Ark or [...] was originally considered, but they assumed they {{would be unable to}} gain permission from the owners of those properties (in this case Paramount Pictures). Lucasfilm only gave the show's staff one condition, which was that the characters had to look exactly <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> in the movies.|$|E

500|$|On {{the issue}} of whether {{competitive}} curlers would be offended by the episode, LaZebnik said [...] "When you hear The Simpsons is going to do their take on your sport, you naturally get a little alarmed, But we ended up being respectful I would say, even, surprisingly respectful. Both Homer and Marge take it seriously." [...] Some curlers, including the Clarks and Patzke, felt that the exposure the sport received was beneficial. Cristin Clark said [...] "Although Homer Simpson probably isn't the ideal athlete I would want to see representing our sport, I just think it's great exposure." [...] Canadian curler Randy Ferbey, a four-time world champion, said [...] "I'm sure they're going to somehow make a mockery of it <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> every other thing, but I think you need to take it with a grain of salt. It brings attention to our sport and I think it's wonderful. The more curling on TV, whether it's in an animated form or real form, the better." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Running to the Edge of the World" [...] is a David Bowie-inspired ballad, which {{features}} Manson singing in falsetto notes during its middle 8. [...] "I Want to Kill You <b>Like</b> <b>They</b> <b>Do</b> in the Movies" [...] is a primarily bass-driven rock song. At over 9 minutes, it is longest {{song on the}} album. Its lyrics document the disintegration of Manson's relationship with Wood, and his fantasies of [...] "smashing her skull in with a sledgehammer." [...] It {{was one of the}} first tracks the band recorded for The High End of Low, and was originally 25 minutes long. Reluctant to release a double album, they re-recorded a shorter version following the completion of the album's final song, [...] "15", with Manson asking the band: [...] "How many minutes do I have left on this CD ? And it was 9 minutes. I said, 'Roll it, I'm going to sing it.' What appears on the record is one [...] performance." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the album was {{revealed}} through the 'Smoking Section' of Rolling Stone magazine on February 2, 2009, where it was also announced that a music video would be filmed for the track [...] "I Want to Kill You <b>Like</b> <b>They</b> <b>Do</b> in the Movies". Throughout March, five rough mixes of songs from the album were leaked. In {{an interview with a}} fansite, Chris Vrenna said of the leak: [...] "I hate stealing of music in any form. If a band chooses to put tracks online, that's great. [...] I think true fans know that usually songs found online before the record is released are rough mixes, and will wait to hear the music the way the artist intended." [...] "We're from America" [...] was released as a free download on the band's website from March 27, with a one-track digital single released through online retailers on April 7. A CD single was released on April 14, and was exclusively sold at Hot Topic. It peaked at number three on Billboards Hot Singles Sales, spending six weeks on the chart.|$|E

500|$|The rhythmic {{direction}} of the music was occasionally interrupted by densely layered percussive and electronic effects, including repeated whirring and grinding sounds. Cosey generated these sounds by running his guitar through a ring modulator and an EMS Synthi A. The latter device was an early synthesizer with knobs and buttons but no keyboard, making it useful for producing abstract noises rather than exact pitches and melodies. He used it to suggest a certain soundscape during each performance, [...] "whether we were in space, or underwater {{or a group of}} Africans playing—just different soundscapes". Onstage, he also had a table set up holding a mbira, claves, agogo bells, and several other hand percussion instruments, which he played or struck with a mallet to indicate a different break or stop. [...] "I would hit them just <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> at [...] fights!", Cosey recalled. His synthesizer sometimes interacted with the experimental sounds Mtume was able to generate from his drum machine, as during the [...] "Ife" [...] segment. Davis gave the instrument to Mtume after receiving it from Yamaha, the Japanese tour's sponsor, and told him [...] "see {{what you can do with}} it." [...] Rather than use it to create rhythms, Mtume processed the drum machine through several different pedals and phase shifters such as the Mu-Tron Bi-Phase, creating a sound he said was [...] "total tapestry".|$|E

2500|$|Up to 49 ports had whaling establishments {{along the}} coast from the French Basque country to Cape Finisterre. The {{principal}} target of the trade was what the French Basques called [...] "sarde". It was later called the Biscayan right whale (Balaena biscayensis), and {{is now known as}} the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). It was caught during its migration from the months of October–November to February–March, with peak catching probably occurring in January. They may have also hunted the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), which existed in the North Atlantic until at least the early 18th century. Bryant suggests that if gray whales inhabited coastal waters <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> today in the North Pacific they would have been likely targets for Basque whalers, perhaps even more so then the North Atlantic right whale – although most contemporary illustrations and skeletal remains from catches were of the latter species. They may have also caught the occasional sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), as remains of this species were found in the old buildings used to try out the blubber into oil.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Green {{released}} his autobiography, Take Me to the River. Two years later, he earned the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and recorded a hit R duet with Ann Nesby on the song, [...] "Put It On Paper". Green again reunited with Willie Mitchell in 2003 for the album, I Can't Stop. A year later, Green re-recorded his previous song, [...] "Simply Beautiful", with Queen Latifah on the latter's album, The Dana Owens Album. In 2005, Green and Mitchell collaborated on Everything's OK. His 2008 album, Lay It Down, {{was produced by}} Ahmir [...] "Questlove" [...] Thompson and James Poyser. It became his first album {{to reach the top}} ten since the early 1970s. The album featured a minor R hit with the ballad, [...] "Stay with Me (By the Sea)", featuring John Legend and also featuring duets with Anthony Hamilton and Corinne Bailey Rae. During an interview for promotion of the album, Green admitted that {{he would have liked to}} duet with Marvin Gaye: [...] "In those days, people didn't sing together <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> now," [...] he said. In 2009, Green recorded [...] "People Get Ready" [...] with Heather Headley on the album, [...] In 2010, Green performed [...] "Let's Stay Together" [...] on Later... with Jools Holland.|$|E

2500|$|The {{major issue}} {{contemporary}} critics had with Leskov's prose {{was what they}} perceived to be an [...] "overabundance of colours"; the grotesque expressiveness of the language he used. This view was shared by some of his colleagues. Leo Tolstoy who rated Leskov very high still thought he was [...] "too over the top" [...] in his linguistic experiments. In a December 3, 1890, letter, writing {{of the short story}} [...] "The Hour of God's Will", he remarked: [...] "This fairytale is excellent, {{but it would have been}} much better if not for this overabundance of talent." [...] Leskov was unrepentant. [...] "To write in a simple manner as Lev Nikolayevich does, is beyond me. Such a gift is not mine... take me as I am, for I've gotten used to polishing my stuff and simply cannot work in any other way," [...] he wrote to Chertkov in one of his 1888 letters. [...] "My clergymen talk like clergymen do, and my muzhiks talk like muzhiks talk in real life... this folkish, vulgar and intricate language is not of my invention, I've listened for years to Russian people talking... and I can say that in my books they talk <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> in real life, not in literary fashion," [...] he insisted later, speaking to biographer Anatoly Faresov.|$|E
