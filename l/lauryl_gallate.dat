40|$|A new biotechnological {{procedure}} using laccase {{in combination}} with a hydrophobic phenolic compound (<b>lauryl</b> <b>gallate)</b> for the hydrophobization of cellulose fibres and internal sizing of paper was developed. Cellulose fibres from hardwood kraft pulp were incubated with laccase (Lac), {{in combination with}} <b>lauryl</b> <b>gallate</b> (LG). The Lac-LG treatment resulted in the internal sizing of paper, and also in significantly reduced water penetration in the handsheets and wettability of the paper surface.

40|$|<b>Lauryl</b> <b>gallate</b> is an {{antioxidant}} food additive showing {{low toxicity}} to normal cells. Here, its antiproliferative effect {{has been studied}} on three human breast cancer cell lines: estrogen-dependent, wild-type p 53, MCF 7; estrogen-independent, non-functional p 53, MDA-MB- 231 and MCF 7 ADR, which overexpresses P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and displays a multidrug-resistant phenotype. <b>Lauryl</b> <b>gallate</b> inhibited proliferation and induced cell cycle alterations in all three cell lines without altering P-gp functionality in the drug-resistant cells. A stable arrest in G 1 phase was observed in MCF 7, while a slow-down of cell cycle progression was induced {{in the other two}} cell lines. <b>Lauryl</b> <b>gallate</b> increased p 53 expression only in MCF 7, and upregulated p 21 Cip 1 and reduced cyclin D 1 levels in all three cell lines. The induction of apoptosis, demonstrated by annexin V-FITC labeling, PARP cleavage and mitochondrial membrane depolarization and morphological alterations, were clearly detected in MCF 7 ADR and MDA-MB- 231 and to a minor extent in MCF 7. Overexpression of Bcl- 2 in MCF 7 ADR cells demonstrated its protective role against morphological alterations and apoptosis. <b>Lauryl</b> <b>gallate</b> induction of p 21 Cip 1 and apoptosis observed in all three cell lines was regulated by Erk 1 / 2 activation. These findings suggest a potential use of <b>lauryl</b> <b>gallate</b> against tumors harboring p 53 mutations and drug-resistant phenotypes. © 2006 Oxford University Press.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to develop an {{innovative}} method for the internal sizing of paper by use of laccase and hydrophobic compounds. Nine different products containing hydrophobic moieties were tested in combination with laccase derived from Trametes villosa on Eucalyptus globulus kraft pulp {{in order to assess}} their internal sizing capability. The strongest internal sizing effect was obtained with <b>lauryl</b> <b>gallate</b> (LG). Heat treatment of the handsheets was found to increase the resistance to water absorption of internally sized samples significantly. Tests were conducted under variable operating conditions, including enzyme and reactant doses and treatment time. In addition to altering the water absorption rate, internal sizing with the laccase–LG treatments was found to affect the mechanical and optical properties of the handsheets. As shown in this work, treatments based on laccase and a hydrophobic compound (particularly <b>lauryl</b> <b>gallate),</b> can provide a new, effective biotechnological method for the internal sizing of paper.

Viral production was strongly inhibited in different cell lines at non-toxic concentrations of the drug (1 - 10 μM), reducing the titres from 3 to more than 5 log. units depending on the multiplicity of infection. In our model system (African swine fever virus in Vero cells), the addition of the drug 1 h before virus adsorption, completely abolished virus productivity in a one-step growth virus cycle. Interestingly, no inhibitory effect was observed when <b>lauryl</b> <b>gallate</b> was added after 5 to 8 hpi. Both cellular and viral DNA synthesis and late viral transcription were inhibited by the drug, but, however, the early viral protein synthesis and the virus-mediated increasing of p 53 remained unaffected. Activation of the apoptotic effector caspase- 3 was not detected after <b>lauryl</b> <b>gallate</b> treatment of Vero cells, and, furthermore, the presence of the drug abrogated the activation of this protease induced by the virus infection.

Four samples of TiO 2 particles were used, three commercial and one obtained by acid catalyzed hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide. The {{size of the}} synthesized nanoparticles was determined by transmission electron microscopy. Surface modification of TiO 2 nanoparticles was performed with propyl gallate and <b>lauryl</b> <b>gallate.</b> The influence {{of the size of}} TiO 2 nanoparticles, their concentration and type of the surface modification on the rheological properties of alkyd resin was investigated. The obtained results have shown that the viscosity of the prepared dispersions was higher than viscosity of the pure resin, it increases with decreasing particle diameter and decreases with frequency increase. Surface modified particles showed higher influence on the viscosity of alkyd resin than unmodified, because their hydrodynamic volume is higher due to the presence of the adsorbed gallates, leading to the increase of effective volume fraction of particles in dispersion. For the lowest TiO 2 concentration, the viscosity was higher for sample modified with <b>lauryl</b> <b>gallate,</b> due to the higher thickness of the adsorbed layer. The increase of concentration, because of less dispersion stability of the particles modified with propyl gallate, leads to particles agglomeration. The presence of agglomerates, which was confirmed by a change in the slope of the functional dependence of storage modulus on loss modulus, leads to a rapid increase in viscosity.

40|$|A new {{approach}} for the hydrophobization of finished cellulosic substrates {{based on a}} previously reported enzymatic technique is proposed. Commercial finished paper was hydrophobized by using laccase from Trametes villosa in combination with <b>lauryl</b> <b>gallate</b> (LG) as hydrophobic compound.

No similar threefold effect from a single compound for the improvement of enzymatic treatments was previously reported. The influence of processing conditions including the LG dose, treatment time and temperature was also examined, resulting in further increased hydrophobicity. Efficient fiber bonding and chemical functionalization were confirmed by thorough washing and Soxhlet extraction of the paper.

Hydrophobic chains of enzyme-modified LG were coupled onto CNF and silica surfaces by direct adsorption of the MCS. Quartz crystal microgravimetry (QCM-D), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and water contact angle (WCA) were used to monitor in situ and characterize the hydrophobization process. Efficient adsorption of the MCS onto CNF and silica surfaces increased their WCA by 88 ° and 78 °, respectively.

40|$|The present work {{describes}} a new method for the surface functionalization of cellulosic sheets, overcoming {{the limitations of}} the traditional treatments, which are usually performed using fibrous suspensions. The method consists in obtaining a product (post-enzymatic) derived from an enzymatic reaction using Laccase and a compound showing a specific property. The obtained product, which has aqueous consistency, is then applied to the surface of a finished paper sheet (or cellulosic substrate) by means of impregnation, spray, size-press, or other available surface deposition technique used in the industry. The functionalization is produced by means of physicochemical interaction between the product and the substrate. In the present research, the methodology is developed to achieve the hydrophobization of finished paper sheets using <b>Lauryl</b> <b>Gallate</b> (LG) as hydrophobic compound, and a laccase derived from Trametes Villosa, reaching absorption times of up to 4000 s and CA values around 130 ° as assessed by the water drop test (WDT) and contact angle measurements (CA) respectivelyPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|An {{innovative}} {{method has}} been developed for the surface hydrophobisation of cellulose-based materials by coating it with a functionalised solution (FS), in which sonicated <b>lauryl</b> <b>gallate</b> (LG, dodecyl 3, 4, 5,-trihydroxybenzoate), sulfonated kraft lignin, and the enzyme laccase play a pivotal role. The rapid treatment with FS increases the hydrophobicity of cellulose sheets considerably. The FS retention on the paper surface was analysed {{as a function of}} refining and application of additives. The properties of the functionalised sheets were assessed by the water-drop test (WDT), and the surface free energy (SFE) was determined via contact angle (CA) measurements in a goniophotometer. WDT resulted in long absorption times of up to 4000 s and CA values were around 130 °. Functionalised solution modification of eucalyptus paper sheets decreased SFE essentially from 55 mJ m- 2 to 10 mJ m- 2. ATR-FTIR suggested that FS was grafted onto the cellulosic sheets. The stability of FS and the control solutions were characterised by Z potential and light scattering measurements. The functionalised solution method is a one-step roll-to-roll process, which is easy to perform also in industrial application without additional investments. It has a potential to substitute the traditional hydrophobing processes. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we studied}} the {{influence}} of the alkyl chain length in enzymatically-oxidized gallates on the development of hydrophobicity on paper-based materials, and further correlated the obtained effect to the redox mechanism of the enzymatic treatment. Laccase (Lac) enzyme was used to oxidize various members of the gallate homologous series in the presence or not of lignosulfonates (SL) to produce several functionalization solutions (FS), which were subsequently applied to cellulosic substrates. The hydrophobicity of the substrates was then assessed by means of water drop test (WDT) and contact angle (WCA) measurements. Hydrophobicity peaked reaching WDT and WCA values around 5000 seconds and 130 o respectively, and then decreased with increasing length of the hydrocarbon chain of gallate. Cyclic voltrammetry (CV) was used to study the effect of SL on the redox reactions of several gallates. The intensity of the anodic peak in their voltammograms decreased increasing the chain length of the gallate. The electrochemical behaviour of <b>lauryl</b> <b>gallate</b> (LG) differed from that of other gallates.

40|$|Gallic {{acid esters}} (GAE) of varying alkyl chain length {{were used to}} {{determine}} how antioxidant physical location and partitioning influence hemoglobin-catalyzed lipid oxidation. Specific GAE used were propyl gallate (PG), octyl gallate (OG), and <b>lauryl</b> <b>gallate</b> (LG). GAE partitioning experiments were performed with either isolated cod muscle membranes or washed cod muscle, which primarily contain polar membrane lipids and myofibrillar proteins. Canola oil was used in some experiments to determine how neutral lipids impact partitioning behavior. GAE distribution was determined spectrophotometrically in the recovered membranes, aqueous phase, and oil layer after employing differential centrifugation. Oxidation was monitored by measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and lipid hydroperoxides development. ^ When GAE were added to the membrane suspensions, significant differences (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in GAE partitioning were observed in the aqueous phase and membrane sediment, where increases in GAE alkyl chain length corresponded with a decrease in aqueous phase concentrations and increases in the membranes. GAE partitioning in the oil fraction did not show significant differences. Also, increases in GAE alkyl chain correlated with increases in GAE membrane detection when GAE were added to the washed fish muscle (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). ^ Adding GAE to the washed cod muscle before the canola oil was the most effective sequence of addition for extending the storage time before lipid oxidation was detected. Among the three GAE tested, PG showed the greatest inhibition against lipid oxidation. The effectiveness of the GAE in the washed cod-canola oil system follows the order, PG 3 ̆e OG 3 ̆e LG, which corresponds with decreasing hydrophobicity. ^ The conclusions of this study are twofold. First, GAE partitioning into the muscle membranes was not the primary factor for delaying the onset of lipid oxidation. Rather, solubility in the aqueous phase showed the greatest impact on extending storage time. Secondly, the order in which GAE and canola oil were added to the washed cod (WC) muscle system influenced hemoglobin-catalyzed lipid oxidation behavior. Adding GAE before the neutral oil may have allowed the GAE to partition more easily into the polar regions of the washed muscle, which in turn provided the most effective protection against oxidation. ...|$|E
