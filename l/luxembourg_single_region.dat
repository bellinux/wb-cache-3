30|$|In the cross-regional {{emergency}} scenario, with {{an increase}} in the emergency path’s vulnerability, the emergency scheduling quantity has a slight increase 0.004, but its total emergency scheduling quantity is less than the <b>single</b> <b>region</b> mode. Additionally, the minimum relief costs increase from 1190.38 to 1190.39, and this value is 0.5 larger than in the <b>single</b> <b>region.</b> Finally, its generalized emergency costs are all less than the single ones (39.5 [*]>[*] 35.9, 58.6 [*]>[*] 54.6), and the degree of generalized emergency costs’ decrease is more than 3.5. Therefore, with the increase in the emergency path’s vulnerability, the cross-regional emergency coordination mode is better than the <b>single</b> <b>region</b> emergency dispatching. When the cross-regional emergency dispatching network reaches equilibrium, the total scheduling of petroleum decreases. However, the generalized emergency costs are less than the <b>single</b> <b>region</b> scenario.|$|R

(2004) took a consumption principle {{and set up a}} five-region IO model, which consists of Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Norway {{and the rest of the}} world in order to calculate CO 2 multipliers and trade balances. They investigated the effect of aggregation on the model and errors in a <b>single</b> <b>region</b> IO model by considering multidirectional trade. In the case of Denmark, 11 Mt. surplus of CO 2 trade in the <b>single</b> <b>region</b> IO model turned into the trade balance when the multidirectional trade is accounted for. It also examined that models constructed on aggregated data are likely to carry substantial errors.|$|R

They argued that this continent formed around 2.5 Ga then rifted before reassembling along the 1.8 Ga Trans-Hudson and Taltson-Thelon orogenies. These two orogenies are derived from continental crust (not oceanic crust) and were probably intracontinental, leaving Kenorland intact from 2.5 Ga to present. Correlations between orogenies in Canada and Siberia remain more controversial.|$|R
