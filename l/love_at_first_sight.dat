25|$|Hitchens met Carol Blue in Los Angeles in 1989 {{and they}} married in 1991. Hitchens called it <b>love</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>sight.</b> In 1999, as harsh critics of Clinton, Hitchens and Carol Blue {{submitted}} an affidavit to the trial managers of the Republican Party in the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Therein they swore that their then-friend, Sidney Blumenthal, had described Monica Lewinsky as a stalker. This allegation contradicted Blumenthal's own sworn deposition in the trial, and it resulted in a hostile exchange of opinion {{in the public sphere}} between Hitchens and Blumenthal. Following the publication of Blumenthal's The Clinton Wars, Hitchens wrote several pieces in which he accused Blumenthal of manipulating the facts. The incident ended their friendship and sparked a personal crisis for Hitchens who was stridently criticised by friends for what they saw as a cynical and ultimately politically futile act.|$|E

The Thénardiers prepare to con some charitable visitors, who turn out to be Valjean and Cosette, who has grown into a beautiful young woman. While the gang bamboozles her father, Cosette runs into Marius, and the pair fall in <b>love</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>sight.</b> Thénardier suddenly recognizes Valjean, but before they can finish the robbery, Javert, now an inspector stationed here in Paris, comes to the rescue ("The Robbery").

Lyrically, [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] deals with <b>love</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> ("You're {{the one that}} I've been waiting for / I don't even know your name") and according to O'Brien, is [...] "an abstract world of nonsense lyrics, disco balls and glitz". It also talks about being in a trance and comparison with various cosmic phenomena in lines like [...] "Cosmic systems in a twine, astral bodies drip like wine", but ultimately returns {{to the subject of}} dance. Remixes were commissioned by Warner Bros. Records in April 2001, featuring mixes by DJ Peter Rauhofer, who transformed the track from techno to progressive house.|$|E

500|$|Austen's {{works are}} noted for their realism, biting social commentary, and masterful use of free {{indirect}} speech, burlesque and irony. They critique {{the novels of}} sensibility {{of the second half}} of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. As Susan Gubar and Sandra Gilbert explain, Austen makes fun of [...] "such novelistic clichés as <b>love</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>sight,</b> the primacy of passion over all other emotions and/or duties, the chivalric exploits of the hero, the vulnerable sensitivity of the heroine, the lovers' proclaimed indifference to financial considerations, and the cruel crudity of parents". Austen's plots, though comic, highlight the way women of the gentry depended on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Like the writings of Samuel Johnson, a strong influence on her, her works are fundamentally concerned with moral issues.|$|E
