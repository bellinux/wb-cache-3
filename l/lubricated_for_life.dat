50|$|Two-stroke {{chainsaws}} require about 2 - 5% {{of oil in}} {{the fuel}} to lubricate the engine, while the motor in electrical chain-saws is normally <b>lubricated</b> <b>for</b> <b>life.</b> Most modern gas operated saws today require a fuel mix of 2% (1:50). Regular gas from most gas stations contain 5 to 10% ethanol which can result in problems of the equipment. Ethanol dissolves plastic, rubber and other material. This leads to problems especially on older equipment. A workaround of this problem is to run fresh fuel only and run the saw dry {{at the end of the}} work.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1920s, the ever-growing {{dissemination}} of sealed bearings throughout the manufacturing industries {{has made the}} use of grease fittings less common. Sealed bearings are <b>lubricated</b> <b>for</b> <b>life</b> at the factory, and are sealed such that the lubricant is not lost or dirtied. Grease fittings are far from obsolete, however, and much new machinery is built with them every year (e.g., tractors, lawnmowers, industrial plant equipment, and still a few car and truck parts). As long as maintenance is even minimally attended to (via occasional lube jobs where new grease is pumped into the bearing), this type of bearing and lubrication setup is cost-effective, simple, and long-lasting.|$|E

The //ND density {{decreased}} in surface strip in good lubrication condition rolling, the rolling texture become evenly in thickness direction, { 111 } texture is dominant, so that r-value increased. Otherwise, the { 111 } texture become unevenly and r-value decreased. It is must better <b>lubricated</b> <b>for</b> r-value rise, the conclusion is verified by the rolling text and texture analysis. ...|$|R
50|$|Standard dies {{are made}} from {{hardened}} steel, and require that the case be <b>lubricated,</b> <b>for</b> the resizing operation, which requires {{a large amount of}} force. Rifle cartridges require lubrication of every case, due to the large amount of force required, while smaller, thinner handgun cartridges can get away with alternating lubricated and unlubricated cases. Carbide dies have a ring of tungsten carbide, which is far harder and slicker than tool steel, and so carbide dies do not require lubrication.|$|R
