50|$|Ball {{lightning}} is an unexplained atmospheric electrical phenomenon. The term {{refers to}} reports of <b>luminous,</b> <b>spherical</b> objects that vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter. Though {{usually associated with}} thunderstorms, the phenomenon lasts considerably longer than the split-second flash of a lightning bolt. Many early reports claim that the ball eventually explodes, sometimes with fatal consequences, leaving behind the odor of sulfur.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from ground}} observations, {{there were also}} reports from several aircraft. The crew of a Tu-154 spotted a <b>luminous</b> <b>spherical</b> object at an {{altitude}} of 12 km. A bright, luminous object was also observed for a half an hour by Georgian writer Guram Pandzhikidze and other passengers of an aircraft returning from Singapore to Moscow {{at an altitude of}} 11 km, at about 4:30 or 5 a.m. Pandzhikidze reported the sighting on 2 October to the director of Karelian Hydrometeorological Observatory Yuri Gromov, who verified the report's copy.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the relativistic aberration of light for a uniformly accelerating observer. We consider an observer who is at rest with respect to a <b>luminous</b> <b>spherical</b> object—a star, say—and then starts to move away with constant acceleration. The main results we derive are the following: (i) The observer always sees an initial increase of the apparent size of the object; (ii) The apparent size of the object reaches a finite value as the proper time of the observer goes to infinity. (iii) There exists a critical value of the acceleration such that the apparent size of the object is always increasing when the acceleration is super-critical. The examples we present illustrate that, while more or less negligible in everyday life, the effect can be significant in the context of spaceflight. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{have gained}} an {{adequate}} understanding of fireball structure basically unavailable to the quantum theory. According {{to the observations}} fireball is a <b>luminous</b> <b>spherical</b> object freely floating in the earth atmosphere and featuring a high sensitivity to external disturbances. External influences lead to an explosive disintegration of fireball. However another, non-explosive variant of fireball disintegration is possible due to its complete “de-excitation”. To date there is {{a variety of different}} hypotheses concerning this phenomenon nature [1 - 7]. During elaboration of such hypotheses there was a number of interesting experimental data obtained. However, an adequate understanding of the essence of this phenomenon has not been gained yet. The majority of current hypotheses for fireball nature are {{based on the fact that}} the observable luminescence is of electromagnetic origin. This topic discussion covers such naturally related phenomena as St. Elmo's fire, crown discharge, atmospheric streak lightning and even Tunguska explosion. What can be common in these phenomena? It is beyond doubt that they have one common factor, that is, luminescence...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the aberration of light for a uniformly accelerating observer. The observer we consider is initially at rest with respect to a <b>luminous</b> <b>spherical</b> object [...] a star, say [...] and then starts to move away with constant acceleration. The main results we derive are the following: (i) The observer always sees an initial increase of the apparent size of the object; (ii) The apparent size of the object approaches a non-zero value as the proper time of the observer goes to infinity. (iii) There exists a critical value of the acceleration such that the apparent size of the object is always increasing when the acceleration is super-critical. We show that, while (i) is a purely non-relativistic effect, (ii) and (iii) are effects of the relativistic aberration of light and are intimately connected with the Lorentzian geometry of Minkowksi spacetime. Finally, the examples we present illustrate that, while more or less negligible in everyday life, the three effects can be significant in the context of space-flight.

2500|$|Ball {{lightning}} {{may be an}} atmospheric electrical phenomenon, {{the physical}} nature of which is still controversial. The term refers to reports of <b>luminous,</b> usually <b>spherical</b> objects which vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter. It is sometimes associated with thunderstorms, but unlike lightning flashes, which last {{only a fraction of}} a second, ball lightning reportedly lasts many seconds. Ball lightning has been described by eyewitnesses but rarely recorded by meteorologists. Scientific data on natural ball lightning is scarce owing to its infrequency and unpredictability. The presumption of its existence is based on reported public sightings, and has therefore produced somewhat inconsistent findings. Brett Porter, wildlife ranger, reported having taken a photo at Queensland of Australia in 1987.|$|R
40|$|Despite of {{its limited}} {{capabilities}} for ball-lightning modeling, the chemically active dust plasma of electric discharges {{is a very}} interesting physical object. Gatchina's discharge, which gives a possibility to study the dust-gas fireball, represents a complex non-stationary process, combining the creation and the destruction of relatively long-living high-enthalpy microscopic states with non-ideal dust plasma and with a gas-dynamic form, resulting in appearance of a <b>spherical</b> <b>luminous</b> object. In the present work we studied spatial structure of the discharge and its dynamics with the help of electric and optical measurements. Comment: 4 pages, 6 figures.

40|$|The RS-PM {{aluminum}} alloys which show less than anticipated toughness properties were studied. After eliminating negative {{variables such as}} sodium and potassium in lithium containing alloys, hydrogen in all Al alloys, and trapped impurities from the atomization processing the data pointed to fine oxides, as {{the primary cause of}} poor toughness properties. The oxide content of aluminum powders increases with: decreasing powder size, deviations from <b>spherical</b> powder shapes, <b>exposure</b> to moist atmospheres either during atomization or in subsequent powder handling, and alloy compositions which contain significant amounts of lithium, magnesium, cerium, and other reactive elements...|$|R
25|$|From a {{technological}} standpoint, notable features of The Casting include full body and facial motion capture, real-time tears and wrinkles on the face, advanced skin shaders, and some advanced rendering features, such as depth of field, <b>spherical</b> harmonics, auto <b>exposure</b> and {{high dynamic range}} rendering. The technology enables animations of pupil dilation, tongue, eyes, fingers, and dynamic hair with physics. The game engine also supports real-time post-processing, with which E3 attendees could interact at the event. Hair physics is achieved {{by the use of}} Havok. Facial motion capture was recorded using Vicon MX40 cameras and system, and was enhanced with a muscle system.|$|R
