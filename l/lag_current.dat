40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the meltdown {{of the commercial}} paper market during the Great Depression, and relates those findings to the recent financial crisis. Theoretical models of financial frictions and information problems imply that lenders will make fewer noncollateralized loans or investments and relatively more extensions of collateralized finance in times of high risk premiums. This study investigates the relevance of such theories to the Great Depression by analyzing whether {{the increased use of}} a collateralized form of business lending (bankers acceptances) relative to that of non-collateralized commercial paper can be econometrically attributable to measures of corporate credit/financial risk premiums. Because commercial paper and bankers acceptances are short-lived, they are more timely measures of the availability of short-term credit than are bank or business failures and the level or growth rate of the stock of bank loans, whose maturities were often longer and were renegotiable. In this way, the study adds to the literature on financial market frictions during the Great Depression, which aside from analyzing securities prices, typically investigates the behavior of credit-related variables that <b>lag</b> <b>current</b> conditions, such as bank failures, bankruptcies, the stock of money, or outstanding bank loans...|$|E
40|$|The Egyptian {{economy is}} marked for its {{budgetary}} imbalances. The present paper addresses {{the important question}} of whether these noticeable budget deficits have come {{to bear on the}} current account component of the Egyptian balance of payments, thus creating imbalances therein as well. We thus examine the familiar so called twin deficit hypothesis. Our findings elucidate the existence of a short and long run relationship linking budgetary deficits to their current account counterparts. Thus a Granger causality test reveals that while budget deficits lead to one <b>lag</b> <b>current</b> account deficits, the latter in turn have arguably been the source of two lags deficits in the government budget, which gives a plausible testimony confirming the reverse hypothesis. Indeed, notwithstanding the strong causal effect whereby budget deficits resulted in four to nine year lagged current account deficits; a remarkably significant counter-effect exists, thus signifying a bi-directional causal relationship between the two types of deficits. The ECM analysis of our results indicates that a 10 percent increase in the government budget deficit will accentuate itself by a further 7 percent increase in the first lag but will also cause a one lag increase of 8. 7 percent in the current account deficit. These findings lend strong support to the twin deficit hypothesis in the Egyptian case. Barring the presence of strong shocks, it can plausibly be claimed that there is a reasonably stron...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{application}} of project finance as the most efficient financing method for the construction and operation of infrastructure projects such as motorways, airports, power plants, pipelines, wastewater/sewage plants, dams, landline or cellular networks, and natural resources mines. These are large-scale, complex, and capital-intensive engineering systems, which until recently, were developed and operated either by the public or the private sector. The latest model for the construction and operation of an infrastructure project is Public-Private Partnerships ("PPP"), a hybrid structure that is becoming widespread. PPP employ private companies to construct and then operate infrastructure assets, which historically have been financed with public resources and operated on a not-for-profit basis. Through PPP agreements such as concessions, governments shift construction and operating risks to the private sector, which is usually more efficient in building and then running the assets. Project finance is a large and rapidly growing subfield of finance, yet one where academic theory and research distantly <b>lag</b> <b>current</b> practice. Project finance relies on private capital sources for financing the PPP infrastructure project, as opposed to direct government financing or corporate financing. (cont.) The thesis hypothesis is that project finance constitutes the most robust and sophisticated financial mechanism for maximizing return on investment and mitigating risk in PPP infrastructure projects. It {{is the goal of}} this thesis to provide the organizational methodology, financial application, risk management techniques, and explain all relevant aspects of project finance so that public policy makers, developers, bankers, contractors, and other decision makers will {{be in a position to}} holistically evaluate this financial instrument and accordingly proceed to its adoption for financing infrastructure projects. by Theodoros Patramanis.

Also significant were short-run events, such as the October 1929 stock market crash and the 1933 bank holiday episode that sparked flights to quality in the bond market and a flight to collateral (BAs) in the money market and perhaps away from the loan market. Furthermore, these shifts in the composition of external finance were large, supporting the view that financial frictions and reduced credit availability may have {{played an important role in}} depressing the U. S. economy during the 1930 s.; The paper also relates these findings to the current financial crisis by examining how the relative use of commercial paper reacted to yield spreads during the current crisis, taking into account Federal Reserve actions to improve liquidity conditions in the money markets. Results suggest that these efforts may have, at least so far, helped prevent the commercial paper market from melting down to the extent seen during the early 1930 s.

Based on the recent econometric techniques we investigate the potential determinants of current account positions in FYROM for both, the short run and long run dynamics covering the period 1998 q 1 - 2013 q 4. By applying the ARDL approach, we estimate the regression equation and present the model with variables that best explain current account developments. Empirical results indicate that there is strong support for co integration relationship between current account, fiscal balance, financial development, terms of trade and trade openness. The financial development, fiscal balance and terms of trade are positively correlated with the current account balance, while openness to international trade is negatively correlated with the current account balance.
