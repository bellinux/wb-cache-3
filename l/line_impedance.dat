[...] The input is fed to both lines in parallel and the outputs are terminated with twice the system impedance bridged between them. [...] The design can be realised in planar format {{but it has a}} more natural implementation in coax – in planar, the two lines have to be kept apart so they do not couple but have to be brought together at their outputs so they can be terminated whereas in coax the lines can be run side-by-side relying on the coax outer conductors for screening. [...] The Wilkinson power divider solves the matching problem of the simple T-junction: it has low VSWR at all ports and high isolation between output ports.

[...] If Zobel {{networks are}} used however, it is only necessary to measure the line response into a fixed resistive load and then design an equaliser to compensate it.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the islanded {{operation}} of microgrids. In this mode of operation, the microsources are required to cooperate autonomously to regulate the local grid voltage and frequency. Droop control is typically used to achieve this autonomous voltage and frequency regulation. However, droop control has real and reactive power sharing limitations when there are mismatches between the microsources. This paper analyses the effect due to mismatches in the power <b>line</b> <b>impedances</b> connecting the source inverters to the microgrid.

30|$|For such {{nonlinear}} systems, small-signal {{model of}} the system is widely used to observe the effect of system parameters on stability under small disturbances [8]. However, complete dynamic model of microgrids is quite complicated due to multi-control stages of DG inverters [9, 10]. As the number of inverters increases in the microgrid, the analysis becomes quite a difficult procedure. Therefore, the recent trend is the simplification of the dynamical model of microgrids and developing a generalized analysis method. The microgrid model proposed in [11] simplifies the analysis by neglecting voltage and current dynamics of DG inverters in the microgrid. However, as shown in [12], this model loses accuracy in the instability boundaries due to static modelling of interconnecting <b>line</b> <b>impedances.</b> To overcome this drawback, a dynamic phasors based modelling has been proposed in [12]. However, the model considers only a single droop controlled DG inverter connected to a stiff (constant voltage) AC network. A more detailed microgrid model, including line currents as state variables, has been proposed in [13]. However, the model neglects power filters of DGs, and considers a microgrid structure without coupling impedances at DG outputs by assuming large enough interconnecting <b>line</b> <b>impedances</b> in the microgrid. Apparently this model is not suitable for LV networks with small interconnecting <b>line</b> <b>impedances.</b> Besides, power filters are required in practice to filter out harmonics and to damp frequency and voltage variations. A generalized stability analysis method for ring type microgrid structures has been proposed in [14], considering only power stage dynamics. However, too many assumptions in the proposed microgrid model reduce the accuracy of the method. Most recently, singular perturbation based model reductions have been presented in [15, 16, 17], which detect the fast states of the system and reduce them from the model. These models have a variety of accuracy levels depending on the order of the reduction.|$|R
