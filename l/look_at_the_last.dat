It is not known if this plan was ever serious, since it was never put into effect. However, in a 1996 interview, having just broken the 200 issue barrier, Sim mentioned his wishes regarding Cerebus, should he be prevented somehow from finishing his goal: [...] "If something like that happens and I'm at mid-issue, the instructions are that the comic book gets printed {{with the rest of}} the pages blank. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> page I drew because that's probably where the gods went 'No, I think we've just about had enough of this guy'".|$|E

My dear friend, if you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> essaykin (though you may leave it alone, and I shall not be in the least surprised or offended), if you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> paper, where the writer imagines Athos and Porthos, Dalgetty and Ivanhoe, Amelia and Sir Charles Grandison, Don Quixote and Sir Roger, walking in at the garden-window, you will at once perceive that NOVELS and their heroes and heroines are our present subject of discourse, into which we will presently plunge. Are you one of us, dear sir, and do you love novel-reading? To be reminded of your first novel will surely be a pleasure to you. Hush! I never read quite to the end of my first, the [...] "Scottish Chiefs." [...] I couldn't. I peeped in an alarmed furtive manner at some of the closing pages. Miss Porter, like a kind dear tender-hearted creature, would not have Wallace's head chopped off at the end of Vol. V. She made him die in prison,* and if I remember right (protesting I have not read the book for forty-two or three years), Robert Bruce made a speech to his soldiers, in which he said, [...] "And Bannockburn shall equal Cambuskenneth."** But I repeat I could not read the end of the fifth volume of that dear delightful book for crying. Good heavens! It was as sad, as sad as going back to school.|$|E

6000|$|A {{farewell}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> {{place in}} which she had seen Kitty tempted her to indulge in a moment of delay. Her eyes rested on the turn in the path at which she had lost sight of the active little figure hastening away to plead her cause. Even in absence, the child was Sydney's good angel still. As she turned away to follow the path that had been shown to her, the relief of tears came at last. It cooled her burning head; it comforted her aching heart. She tried to walk on. The tears blinded her--she strayed from the path--she would have fallen but for a hand that caught her, and held her up. A man's voice, firm and deep and kind, quieted her first wild feeling of terror. [...] "My child, you are not fit to be by yourself. Let me take care of you--let me comfort you, if I can." ...|$|E

[...] "No, I shall not," [...] said Lily, almost sharply, shrinking from the finger that threatened to touch her sore. [...] "There are things which should never be talked about." [...] "Well, well; perhaps so," [...] said Mrs Boyce. But for a minute or two she was unable to fall back upon any other topic, and sat looking at Lily with painful tenderness. I need hardly say what were Lily's sufferings under such a gaze; but she bore it, acknowledging to herself in her misery that the fault did not lie with Mrs Boyce. How could Mrs Boyce have looked at her otherwise than tenderly? ...|$|E

Ay, and there were the fellers round her wringing down the cheese and bustling about and saying, 'Ware o' the pommy, ma'am: 'twill spoil yer gown.' 'Never mind me,' says she. Then Gabe brought her some of the new cider, and she must needs go drinking it through a strawmote, and not in a nateral way at all. 'Liddy,' says she, 'bring indoors a few gallons, and I'll make some cider-wine.' Sergeant, I was no more to her than a morsel of scroff in the fuel-house!" ...|$|E

60|$|I need {{scarcely}} {{mention in}} particular {{any more of}} the works of Turner, because there is not one of his mountain distances in which these facts are not fully exemplified. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> vignette--the Farewell, in Rogers's Italy; observe the excessive sharpness of all the edges, almost amounting to lines, in the distance, while there is scarcely one decisive edge in the foreground. Look at the hills of the distance in the Dunstaffnage, Glencoe, and Loch Achray, (illustrations to Scott,) in the latter of which the left-hand side of the Benvenue is actually marked with a dark line. In fact, Turner's usual mode of executing these passages is perfectly evident in all his drawings; it is not often that we meet with a very broad dash of wet color in his finished works, but in these distances, as we before saw of his shadows, all the effect has been evidently given by a dash of very moist pale color, probably turning the paper upside down, so that a very firm edge may be left {{at the top of the}} mountain as the color dries. And in the Battle of Marengo we find the principle carried so far as to give nothing more than actual outline for the representation of the extreme distance, while all the other hills in the picture are distinctly darkest at the edge. This plate, though coarsely executed, is yet one of the noblest illustrations of mountain character and magnitude existing.|$|E
60|$|From {{that hour}} Mr. Freely felt sure of success: being in privacy with an estimable man {{old enough to}} be his father, and being rather lonely in the world, it was natural he should unbosom himself a little on {{subjects}} which he could not speak of in a mixed circle--especially concerning his expectations from his uncle in Jamaica, who had no children, and loved his nephew Edward better than any one else in the world, though he had been so hurt at his leaving Jamaica, that he had threatened to cut him off with a shilling. However, he had since written to state his full forgiveness, and though he was an eccentric old gentleman and could not bear to give away money during his life, Mr. Edward Freely could show Mr. Palfrey the letter which declared, plainly enough, who would be the affectionate uncle's heir. Mr. Palfrey actually saw the letter, and could not help admiring the spirit of the nephew who declared that such brilliant hopes as these made no difference to his conduct; he should work at his humble business and make his modest fortune at it all the same. If the Jamaica estate was to come to him--well and good. It was nothing very surprising for one of the Freely family to have an estate left him, considering the lands that family had possessed in time gone by--nay, still possessed in the Northumberland branch. Would not Mr. Palfrey take another glass of rum? and also <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> year's balance of the accounts? Mr. Freely was a man who cared to possess personal virtues, and did not pique himself on his family, though some men would.|$|E
