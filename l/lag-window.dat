40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the fundamental frequency (F 0) determination of a speech signal, and proposes four improvements to conventional frequency-domain methods. The major improvement is a multi-scale analysis which extends the range of F 0 that can be correctly processed. It builds on the <b>lag-window</b> method proposed by Sagayama (1978), hence the name "multi-lagwindow ". Secondly, a modification of the <b>lag-window</b> method itself improves its robustness to periodic noises (while loosing its gainindependence property). Thirdly, a rescaling is introduced to permit a full Dynamic Programming search for the optimal F 0 curve. Finally, a mathematically justified peak interpolation is proposed for replacing the conventional, inaccurate parabolic interpolation. These four improvements result in an accurate, robust, extendedrange F 0 determination method, which was tested on spontaneous speech from 20 speakers, ranging from less than 50 Hz to more than 600 Hz...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—There is no {{fundamental}} difference between <b>lag-windowing</b> a correlation sequence and multiple-windowing a data sequence when {{the objective is to}} reduce the mean-squared error of a spectrum estimator. By analyzing the approximate low-rank factorization of a bandlimiting Toeplitz operator, we find that <b>lag-windowed</b> (or spectrally smoothed) spectrum estimators have multiple-data-windowed implementations. This makes the Blackman–Tukey–Grenander–Rosenblatt spectrogram equivalent to the Thomson spectrum estimator (and vice-versa), meaning BTGR spectrograms may be implemented in a multichannel filterbank version of the Thomson estimator.

A new time-frequency distribution, the <b>lag-windowed</b> Wigner-Ville distribution (LWWVD), improves the time-frequency representation by minimizing the interference terms due to the cross-terms. Comparisons with the conventional Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), reduced interference distributions (RID) and other related methods are made based on the criteria of the mainlobe width and the signal-to-interference ratio. Consistently, the LWWVD gives the most accurate time-frequency representation for ASK and FSK signals...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} {{different}} block bootstrap methods for time series, and present {{them in a}} unified framework. We then revisit a recent result of Lahiri (1999 b) comparing the different methods and give a corrected bound on their asymptotic relative efficiency; we also introduce a new notion of finite-sample “attainable” relative efficiency. Finally, based {{on the notion of}} spectral estimation via the flat-top <b>lag-windows</b> of Politis and Romano (1995), we propose practically useful estimators of the optimal block size for the aforementioned block bootstrap methods. Our estimators are characterized by the fastest possible rate of convergence which is adaptive on the strength of the correlation of the time series as measured by the correlogram. ...|$|R

40|$|Digital {{modulation}} signals such as FSK are time-varying {{signals that}} can he {{represented in the}} time-frequency representation. The smooth <b>lag-windowed</b> Wigner-Ville distribution (SLWWVD) is proposed as a method to obtain accurate time-frequency representation of FSK signals used in HF (High Frequency) radio communications. Unlike existing time-frequency distributions such as the windowed Wigner-Ville distribution (WWVD) or the smooth windowed Wigner- Ville distributioii (SWWVD). the proposed timefrequency distribution does not require priori knowledge of the signal modulation parameters such as the hitduration and subcarrier frequencies. The algorithm generates the time-frequency representation directly based on the signal characteristics. Comparison based on mainlobe width and signal-to-interference ratio shows the SLWWVD generate accurate time-hquency representation for simulated and actual communication signals...|$|R

40|$|Improved {{performance}} in higher-order spectral density estimation (polyspectral estimation) and density estimation of censored data is achieved using a general class of infinite-order kernels. These estimates are asymptotically less biased {{but with the}} same order of variance {{as compared to the}} classical estimators with second-order kernels. A simple, data-dependent algorithm for selecting the bandwidth is introduced and is shown to be consistent with estimating the optimal bandwidth for the infinite-order kernels. The combination of the specialized family of kernels with the new bandwidth selection algorithm yields a considerably improved density estimation procedure surpassing the performances of existing estimators using second-order kernels. Infinite- order estimators are also utilized in a secondary manner as pilot estimators in the plug-in approach for bandwidth choice in second-order kernels. Simulations illustrate the improved accuracy of the proposed estimator against other nonparametric estimators of the density, bispectrum, and hazard function. Symmetries of the auto-cumulant function of a kth-order stationary time series {{play an important role in}} polyspectral estimation, and these symmetries are derived through a connection with the symmetric group of degree k.

40|$|Classical {{spectral}} {{methods are}} subject to two fundamental limitations: they only can account for covariance-related serial dependencies, and they require second-order stationarity. Much attention has been devoted lately to quantile-based spectral methods that go beyond covariance-based serial dependence features. At the same time, covariance-based methods relaxing stationarity into much weaker local stationarity conditions {{have been developed for}} a variety of time-series models. Here, we are combining those two approaches by proposing quantile-based spectral methods for locally stationary processes. We therefore introduce a time-varying version of the copula spectra that have been recently proposed in the literature, along with a suitable local <b>lag-window</b> estimator. We propose a new definition of local strict stationarity that allows us to handle completely general non-linear processes without any moment assumptions, thus accommodating our quantile-based concepts and methods. We establish a central limit theorem for the new estimators, and illustrate the power of the proposed methodology by means of a simulation study. Moreover, in two empirical studies (namely of the Standard & Poor's 500 series and a temperature dataset recorded in Hohenpeissenberg) we demonstrate that the new approach detects important variations in serial dependence structures both across time and across quantiles. Such variations remain completely undetected, and are actually undetectable, via classical covariance-based spectral methods. Comment: AMS 1980 subject classification : 62 M 15, 62 G 35.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} surface CO 2 fluxes at grid scales, a regional surface CO 2 flux inversion system (Carbon Flux Inversion system and Community Multi-scale Air Quality, CFI-CMAQ) {{has been developed}} by applying the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to constrain the CO 2 concentrations and applying the ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS) to optimize the surface CO 2 fluxes. The smoothing operator {{is associated with the}} atmospheric transport model to constitute a persistence dynamical model to forecast the surface CO 2 flux scaling factors. In this implementation, the "signal-to-noise" problem can be avoided; plus, any useful observed information achieved by the current assimilation cycle can be transferred into the next assimilation cycle. Thus, the surface CO 2 fluxes can be optimized as a whole at the grid scale in CFI-CMAQ. The performance of CFI-CMAQ was quantitatively evaluated through a set of Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) by assimilating CO 2 retrievals from GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite). The results showed that the CO 2 concentration assimilation using EnKF could constrain the CO 2 concentration effectively, illustrating that the simultaneous assimilation of CO 2 concentrations can provide convincing CO 2 initial analysis fields for CO 2 flux inversion. In addition, the CO 2 flux optimization using EnKS demonstrated that CFI-CMAQ could, in general, reproduce true fluxes at grid scales with acceptable bias. Two further sets of numerical experiments were conducted to investigate the sensitivities of the inflation factor of scaling factors and the smoother window. The results showed that the ability of CFI-CMAQ to optimize CO 2 fluxes greatly relied on the choice of the inflation factor. However, the smoother window had a slight influence on the optimized results. CFI-CMAQ performed very well even with a short <b>lag-window</b> (e. g. 3 days) ...|$|E
