40|$|The {{abundance}} of flawed software {{has been identified}} as the main cause of the poor security of computer networks since major viruses and worms have been exploiting the vulnerabilities of such software. As an incentive mechanism for software security quality improvement, software liability has been intensely discussed among computer scientists, jurists, and policy makers for a long time. In this paper, we examine how the <b>liability</b> <b>mechanism</b> affects a monopolistic software vendor’s decision on security quality and market coverage. We then analyze the welfare implications of the <b>liability</b> <b>mechanism.</b> We find that high marginal willingness to pay for the software leads to full market coverage without liability. When liability is imposed, full market coverage obtains only if the expected loss is bounded. We also find that security quality is underprovided without liability while socially optimal level is offered with liability. Interestingly, our results indicate that imposing liability may discourage the monopolist from improving security while it leads to higher consumer surplus. When the marginal willingness to pay is relatively low, the <b>liability</b> <b>mechanism</b> brings higher social surplus. In the presence of information asymmetry between the vendor and the customers, the <b>liability</b> <b>mechanism</b> yields higher security quality and higher consumer surplus. ...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of Grameen Bank in 1976 by Professor Muhammad Yunus, many economists have studied extensively, either theoretically or empirically, {{the success of the}} Grameen Bank in eradicating the poverty problem in Bangladesh. Therefore, this paper aims to apply the mechanism design theory in microfinance by examining the role of joint liability and cross-reporting mechanism in the loan contract which designing by microfinance lender. In doing so, this study simplified the joint <b>liability</b> <b>mechanism</b> proposed by Ghatak (1999, 2000) and cross-reporting mechanism by Rai and Sjostrom (2004). Based on the joint-liability mechanism, it is clearly stated that the microfinance lender can minimize or avoid the adverse selection problem in the credit market through peer selection and peer screening. In the meantime, the joint <b>liability</b> <b>mechanism</b> is better than individual lending in terms of increasing the social welfare among the poor borrower, charging lower interest rates and generating high repayment rates. In contrast, Rai and Sjostrom (2004) argue that joint liability alone is not enough to efficiently induce borrowers to help each other. Indeed, the cross-reporting mechanism is also important for lenders in order to minimize the problem of asymmetric information in the credit market. The cross-reporting mechanism is also efficient because it can influence the borrower to be truthful-telling {{about the state of the}} project and subsequently can minimize the deadweight loss (punishment) among the borrowers. In comparison, without cross-reporting, the lending mechanism is inefficient because the borrower will be imposed harsh punishment from the bank and the bank can undertake auditing or verify the state of the project and punish accordingly. ...|$|E

There is also an important role for tort law doctrine in reflecting a move away from the traditional paternalistic structure of the doctor-patient relationship towards a desirable shared decision-making model. The fact that compensation schemes are not amenable to these goals indicates the necessity of maintaining a dual system, in order to accommodate the plurality of objectives that should be achieved in this context...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{essential}} tools of poverty reduction would be the viable expansion of institutional credit facilities to large sections {{of the people who}} neither have adequate collateral nor credit history to secure a loan. In this backdrop, social collateral is popularized through the group lending programs to address the credit market problems. Microfinance through group lending is acting as a screening device; the joint <b>liability</b> <b>mechanism</b> creates incentives for internal monitoring. Hence, it has received a lot of attention from policy makers as well as academicians. It is playing an important role in delivering financial services to the “socially and economically excluded” poor, in general, and women, in particular. The group lending works with various dynamic incentives. One such kind is principle of progressive lending and it plays a vital role in sustaining the groups for the persistent delivery of microfinance services to its members. In progressive lending, a typical borrower receives very small amounts at first, which increases with good repayment conduct or it links new, larger loans to past repayment. This article explores possible theoretical and empirical relationship between progressive lending and its determinants in group lending approach. The primary survey was conducted in 10 villages covering 106 self-help groups and 318 members in Karnataka, India.

As evidence for this interpretation, we show that a borrower’s delay in installment repayment was correlated with other group members’ repayment delays, beyond the level explained by possible correlation of project failures due to locally covariate shocks during the pre-reform period. The post-reform period is divided into two sub-periods by an earthquake in October 2005. Analysis of repayment behavior in the post-reform period yields the results that suggest that (1) the relative success under the new system was because of the suppression of strategic behavior among group members, thereby allowing joint liability schemes to function as individual lending schemes de facto and (2) the earthquake only marginally affected the new system in terms of repayment delays. group lending, joint liability, contingent renewal, strategic default, covariate shocks...|$|E
40|$|The present article {{seeks to}} explore {{previously}} undiscussed {{differences between the}} negligence and strict liability rules and thereby examine the required medical liability reform, if such reform is indeed required. Our main thesis is that negligence {{as a basis for}} liability entails a unique mechanism, which is essentially different than the strict <b>liability</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and is more efficient for several reasons, related to the legal function of resolving partial information problems which cause partial failure in the healthcare market. Among other things, the negligence mechanism (1) motivates the parties to a potential damages claim to invest in information gathering; (2) motivates doctors and medical institutions to adjust the appropriate medical procedures through time; (3) uses the market players 2 ̆ 7 professional reputation to resolve the market 2 ̆ 7 s partial information problems; (4) introduces the courts as an additional oversight level; and (5) assists the law in reducing costs resulting from lack of standardization. Furthermore, the negligence rule allows the law to ensure a more efficient risk distribution. One reason for that is that it allows the law to distribute risk resulting from negligent errors separately from the risk resulting from non-negligent errors. This thesis leads to conclusions regarding various issues, such as the required medical liability reform. Inter alia, we argue that it is inappropriate to limit the negligence mechanism 2 ̆ 7 s application, such as shrinking the limitation period or by imposing damage caps. We also argue for the advisability of creating and refining mechanisms to assist in resolving the market 2 ̆ 7 s partial information problems.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of microfinance worldwide has {{been due to}} its claimed impacts on poverty reduction and women's empowerment. Conversely, it has been criticised for furthering the neoliberal policies of external agencies by using poor women’s entrepreneurship and mutual trust as a joint <b>liability</b> <b>mechanism</b> to reduce the costs and risks for the capital provider. Set against this, Indian microfinance exhibits {{a wide spectrum of}} delivery models, from subsidized to unsubsidized and commercial credit. Microfinance impact literature considers its impact to be neutral to the process of delivery and therefore contains few cross model comparisons. It privileges the dominant policy model of primarily positive impacts, and has overlooked rather than examined differing worldviews. This research questions external perspectives and explores actor perspectives. This research is located in a semi-arid livelihoods context, i. e. the Koppal district in Karnataka State, India. It takes a critical and interpretive approach and adopts a longitudinal case study methodology to examine use of money from women's own perspectives. The field work shows that loan demand is context dependent and low in a semi-arid region with uncertain and risky investment opportunities. Microfinance provided by informal sources was used for survival and social needs. Three models of formal microfinance delivery emerged, of which two relegated the poor to the margins but the SHG-Bank linkage model combined poverty focus and market orientation to offer a stable borrower lender relationship. The field research also considered the social learning process that takes place among Self Help Groups (SHGs) in the utilisation and repayment of microfinance. The women differentiate money delivered in different ways, and social relationships determined financial relationships. This research reveals multiple meanings of money, recognises new opportunities and vulnerabilities created by formation of SHGs, and highlights that microfinance models which provide women access and control over money enhanced their decision making ability and so were the most empowering.

40|$|In {{this article}} we want to verify if Bank of Canada's actions on the {{availability}} of credit were efficient from 1967 to 1976. During this period, the interest rate was chiefly used to maintain balance of payments equilibrium and the Bank of Canada was trying to affect internal credit conditions (here banks' loans) through its effect on the chartered banks' liquid asset ratio. However, this ratio is an imperfect indicator of the availability of banks' credit. Chartered banks have in fact many techniques to obtain liquidities: the whole of these constitutes their <b>liability</b> management <b>mechanism.</b> By this way, they can immune themselves from a restrictive monetary policy which operates via the liquid asset ratio. The degree of accommodation of loans is also another factor to consider when studying the impact of the Bank of Canada on banks' loans. It is evident that a high degree of accommodation of loans is a serious obstacle to monetary policy: liquidity management is probably pushed very far in this case. Our theoretical model takes into account these considerations. And the estimation of this model shows that loans have little reacted to Bank of Canada's actions. The degree of loans accommodation was high and consequently banks checked the Bank of Canada's policy by their liquidity management mechanism. ...|$|R

This could have disastrous consequences for human institutions and natural ecosystems, including massive sea level rise, eradication of coral reefs throughout the world, and potentially catastrophic declines in agricultural production, especially in the global South. As a consequence, increasing attention {{has been devoted to}} a series of potential responses that were once considered “taboo,” and “forbidden territory,” climate geoengineering. Climate geoengineering is defined by the National Academy of Sciences as “options that would involve large-scale engineering of our environment in order to combat or counteract the effects of changes in atmospheric chemistry. ” These methods include ocean iron fertilization, marine cloud albedo enhancement, stratospheric sulfate injection, air capture, and the use of planetary sunshades, all of which have the potential to substantially ameliorate, or reverse, current warming trends. At the same time, all of these schemes could have serious negative ramifications, including adverse regional impacts with momentous equitable implications, e. g. disruption of monsoonal cycles or increases in regional temperature trends, as well as potential global impacts, e. g. depletion of the ozone layer. While geoengineering was once considered to be “taboo” in the forum of climate change policymaking, the increasing desperation engendered by the specter of passing critical temperature thresholds has led to increasing interest in the approach, including by key stakeholders, such as the U. S. Congress and U. K. Parliament, the UK’s Royal Society, and the U. S. National Academy of Science. Even President Obama’s chief science advisor has indicated that geoengineering should “not be taken off the table” as a potential component of climate policymaking. As a potential embrace of climate geoengineering becomes more likely, the need for effective governance mechanisms for research and development, as well as potential deployment is emerging as an urgent priority. This is a quintessential example of “Global Environmental Law at a Crossroads,” as geoengineering will present immense challenges in adapting current international environmental law to consider potential issues such as constraining of unilateral deployment and potential <b>liability</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> as well as developing new instruments to fill in lacunae. This presentation suggests that any governance mechanisms developed in the future should take into account the procedural and substantive protections accorded by international human rights law instruments. The presentation will outline why a human rights lens is particularly salutary in the context of geoengineering governance, as well as outlining specific pertinent provisions of international and regional instruments. Additionally, the presentation will address problems in applying a human rights approach in this context, including causality and extraterritorial application of human rights instruments...|$|R

The contract defines the rights, liability, and expectations of both the outsourcing vendor and the outsourcing customer concerned and is often the only solid mechanism for regulating the relationship of the parties. Outsourcing contracts are often of high value and last a relatively long time. It is therefore of particular importance to get them right first time. Research on IT outsourcing contractual issues tends to be mostly theoretical and very limited in scope. There is relatively little literature available on the systematic and practical treatment of issues relating to IT outsourcing contracts.

Within these legislations exists elements of risk assessment and risk-based corrective action. Despite this progress, we argue that contaminated land management approaches in Nigeria need further development {{to be able to}} integrate new scientific information, and to address environmental, economic, and social values. By comparison, advanced contaminated land regimes in the United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States of America (USA) apply a number of integrative approaches (e. g. sustainability appraisal, <b>liability</b> regime, funding <b>mechanisms,</b> technology demonstration) that enable them to meet the environmental, economic, and social needs of their populations. In comparison, Nigerian governance lacks many of these mechanisms and management of contaminated land is ad hoc. In this paper we propose an integrated risk assessment framework for Nigeria that incorporates the principles of sustainability and stakeholder engagement into the decision-making processes for contaminated land risk assessment and risk management. The integrated approach relies on transparency to promote acceptance and build trust in institutions, and uses stakeholder engagement to address data deficiencies. We conclude this paper with a roadmap for how Nigeria might implement such an integrative approach into their existing contaminated land regulatory system, as well as identify a series of policy priorities that should be addressed...|$|R
40|$|It was {{not until}} the 1980 s that China&# 39;s policy makers became aware of the {{detrimental}} impacts on urban health from soil pollution as a result of industrial waste emissions. For the past three decades, the Chinese government has strived to prevent and control industrial pollution. Setting appropriate environmental policies is the key to mitigating the legacy of industrial waste emissions accumulated for three decades. In this paper, we review the development process by outlining the evolution of the policies and the resulting legal infrastructure in terms of acts, regulations, ordinances, and standards. Deficiencies of the existing policies are identified. In the early stages, environmental policies were fragmented, consisting of single-purpose laws that are narrowly focused. With time, these policies gradually evolved to become better integrated and comprehensive management plans. However, the laws emphasize contaminated site restoration instead of preventing soil pollution. The legal framework shows that the policies that are in place often lack clear mandates because the authorizations are piggybacked on environmental acts and regulations that do not directly address issues of soil pollution. Furthermore, implementation plans are impractical due to outdated soil quality standards, unclear soil cleanup goals, unenforceable <b>liability</b> and supervision <b>mechanisms,</b> limited funding, lack of transparency and public outreach, and the unreliable financial and technical capabilities of the remediation industries...|$|R
40|$|Air {{movement}} and associated oxygen transport through waste rock dumps {{has the potential}} to significantly enhance the rate of oxidation of pyrite-bearing material. While this is a desired outcome for most heap leach operations, airflow in waste rock storage facilities can result in significant increases in generation and acceleration of acid rock drainage. Hence, a good understanding of internal airflow through waste rock dumps is required to control ARD and minimize any associated <b>liability.</b> The principal <b>mechanisms</b> contributing to airflow and oxygen transport in a waste rock pile include (i) diffusion, (ii) advection due to a thermal gradient (chimney effect) and/or wind pressure gradients and (iii) advection due to barometric pumping. While diffusion is typically limited to a near-surface zone of a few meters depth, advection and barometric pumping have the potential to move air (and oxygen) to much greater depths into the pile. In general, the more permeable the waste rock material, and the greater the height-to-depth ratio of the waste rock pile, the greater is the potential for advective air movement. The reactivity of the waste rock material as well as the coarseness (hence air permeability), and the spatial variability of these properties within a pile, have a strong influence on the magnitude of thermally induced advection. In contrast, air movement due to barometric pumping is controlled by the waste rock porosity...|$|R
40|$|This thesis takes {{a global}} {{approach}} to analyzing, discussing and critiquing {{the effectiveness of}} product liability law in Europe. The thesis approaches the study of European product liability law beyond the main product liability instruments themselves. It first offers a purely legal analysis, based on the content, effects and judicial interpretation of the European product liability directive and on the procedural context {{in which it is}} framed. Second, it analyzes the directive's effects on accident deterrence, examining the interaction between Europe's ex post liability laws and ex ante safety regulations from theoretical as well as practical perspectives. Third, the thesis analyzes the effectiveness of ex post <b>liability</b> as a <b>mechanism</b> for compensating the victims of product-related accidents in Europe. This last issue of victim compensation reaches beyond tort law to include alternative sources of compensation, such as public and private insurance. Social insurance systems, in particular, arise as the major mechanism of compensation in Europe, and for this reason the compensation of product-related accident victims proves {{to be one of the}} issues that differentiates the role, development and effectiveness of product liability law in Europe from the U. S. experience. Using the European product liability directive as the starting point and focus of analysis, this thesis contributes to the literature by shifting the analysis from the product liability directive itself to the more general question of product regulation in Europe. 2019 - 08 - 1...|$|R
