5|$|Juniata County {{is located}} between two major {{metropolitan}} areas. One is State College, which is {{northwest of the}} county. The other is Harrisburg, which is to the southeast of the county. U.S. Route 22/U.S. Route 322, which is a four-lane highway, <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> the county to these metropolitan areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} transept {{is named}} for Henry Gurdon Marquand, the benefactor of the Marquand Chapel, which {{burned to the ground}} in 1920 and which the present chapel was built to replace. An American flag flown by the USS Princeton hangs from the transept's north wall. The southern transept {{is named for}} Chester Alwyn Braman, the first donor to the University Chapel Fund. A staircase <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> the Braman Transept to the Bright Pulpit.|$|E
5|$|Design {{managers}} often {{operate in}} the area of design leadership; however, design management and design leadership are interdependent rather than interchangeable. Like management and leadership, they differ in their objectives, achievements of objectives, accomplishments, and outcomes. Design leadership <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> creation of a vision to changes, innovations, and implementation of creative solutions. It stimulates communication and collaboration through motivation, sets ambitions, and points out future directions to achieve long-term objectives. In contrast, design management is reactive and responds to a given business situation by using specific skills, tools, methods, and techniques. Design management requires design leadership to know where to go and design leadership requires design management to know how to get there.|$|E
50|$|After {{extensive}} scientific review, Needleman's {{findings were}} instrumental in convincing the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to issue guidelines for the diagnosis and management of lead poisoning in children, in goading the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to mandate the removal of <b>lead</b> <b>from</b> gasoline and inducing the Consumer Product Safety Commission to ban <b>lead</b> <b>from</b> interior paints. Needleman's research also helped cause the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to remove <b>lead</b> <b>from</b> thousands of housing units across the US.|$|R

5|$|Ganoga Glen has ten named waterfalls in 1.1miles (1.8km). It is 1.8miles (2.9km) from PA 118 in {{the south}} to Waters Meet and the {{southern}} end of Ganoga Glen. From the north, it is 0.3miles (0.48km) from the Lake Rose trailhead parking lot by Lake Jean to Mohawk, the northernmost waterfall. There is also the 2.8-mile (4.5km) Ganoga View Trail, which <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> Pennsylvania Route 487 in the west to Ganoga Falls. The Highland Trail, which meets the Falls Trail a short distance north of Mohawk Falls, is the 1.2-mile (1.9km) connector between the northern ends of Ganoga Glen and Glen Leigh.|$|E
5|$|Just east of Bradhurst Avenue, NY141 {{connects to}} the Taconic State Parkway {{by way of a}} partial interchange. The {{junction}} has only two connections; the first links NY141 to the southbound parkway, while the second <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> the northbound direction of the parkway to NY141 via West Cross Street. Continuing eastward, the highway passes under the parkway and enters the commercial center of Hawthorne. Here, NY141 crosses over the Metro-North Railroad before turning northward onto Elwood Avenue. Over the next , NY141 closely parallels the railroad's Harlem Line, serving its Hawthorne station as the road heads north. After three blocks, the road and railroad turn to the northeast and begin to run alongside the Saw Mill River Parkway. Elwood Avenue ends shortly after the curve, giving way to Commerce Street.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} on the Wirral has identified a possible landing site for the Norse and Scots. This is a feature called Wallasey Pool. This is {{in the north of}} the Wirral near the River Mersey. The pool is linked to the river by a creek which, before it was developed into modern docks, stretched inland some two miles, was, at high tide over 20 feet deep and was surrounded by a moss or mere which is now known as Bidston Moss. In addition to this landing site a Roman Road <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> the area of Bidston to Chester. Following the route of this road would take an invading force through the area the battle {{is believed to have been}} fought. Landscape survey has identified a likely position for Bruna's burh. This survey places the burh at Brimstage approximately 11 miles from Chester.|$|E

5|$|The Aldford Approach <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> {{the village}} of Aldford and crosses the River Dee by the GradeI listed Aldford Iron Bridge, which was built in 1824 by William Hazledine for the 1stMarquis. Iron Bridge Lodge, {{adjacent}} to this bridge, was designed by Douglas and Fordham in 1894 and is listed at GradeII. Also on this approach is Coachmore Hill Lodge which was designed in the 1880s by Douglas; it is listed at GradeII. On the approach, near the Dutch Tea Garden are gates with an overthrow, and piers dating from about 1870 in Classic Revival style, listed at GradeII.|$|E
5|$|The National Register of Historic Places listing for Hebron Church {{includes}} the brick church and cemetery. They are accessible from WV 259 by a semicircular asphalt driveway, {{separated from the}} church and cemetery by a wrought iron fence and lined with large, old-growth maple trees along the property's northwestern perimeter. A paved brick walkway <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> {{the gate to the}} northwestern fa√ßade and two main entrances of the church. The church is surrounded on its northeastern, southeastern, and southwestern sides by a cemetery which is still in use. The cemetery contains over 600 gravestones, several yuccas, a hemlock tree, and a boxwood. A modern brick community building, within the historic boundary south of the church and cemetery, is used for church activities.|$|E
5|$|The Rhyd Ddu path, {{also called}} the Beddgelert Path, <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> the village of Rhyd Ddu, west of Snowdon, gently up on to Llechog, a broad ridge {{dropping}} west from the summit. It {{is considered one of}} the easier routes to the summit, with the advantage that the summit is visible from the start, but is one of the least used routes. It climbs at a shallow gradient to Bwlch Main, shortly southwest of the summit, from where it climbs more steeply, meeting up with the Watkin Path at a site marked with a large standing stone a few hundred metres from the summit. An alternative start begins at Pitt's Head on the A4085 road.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening night}} was on 12 October 1805 was a {{production}} of Richard III, with an unknown actor in the lead. Though not a success, the theatre soon established a good reputation and thrived under the management of William Wyatt Dimond. Early performances included appearances by the child actors Master Betty and Clara Fisher, with adult <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> prominent actors on the London stage including Dorothea Jordan, William Macready and Edmund Kean. In addition to Shakespeare and other serious drama, the productions included opera and comedy with Joseph Grimaldi playing the clown in a pantomime of Mother Goose in November 1815.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} original woodwork, sills, door frames, {{and interior}} doors, are all solid oak. The interior walls are 12inches thick and, either painted or covered with paneling. An open, double staircase <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> {{the first floor}} to {{the second and third}} floors and the center of the building houses an elevator which moves from the basement to the third floor. The interior floors are all white pine wood, though some of the floors have now been carpeted. First floor ceilings are 15feet high, with doors at a height of 12feet. The second floor features the courtrooms, which, through the 1980s remodel, had the ceilings lowered to 10feet. The interior renovation was completed at a cost of US$1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|The site of Pickett's Charge {{is one of}} the best-maintained {{portions}} of the Gettysburg Battlefield. Despite millions of annual visitors to Gettysburg National Military Park, very few have walked in the footsteps of Pickett's division. The National Park Service maintains a neat, mowed path alongside a fence that <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> the Virginia Monument on West Confederate Avenue (Seminary Ridge) due east to the Emmitsburg Road {{in the direction of the}} Copse of Trees. Pickett's division, however, started considerably south of that point, near the Spangler farm, and wheeled to the north after crossing the road. In fact, the Park Service pathway stands between the two main thrusts of Longstreet's assault‚ÄîTrimble's division advanced north of the current path, while Pickett's division moved from farther south.|$|E

5|$|Meier also {{designed}} three other buildings located {{next to the}} north promontory and offset at a 22.5 degree angle from the main axis of the Museum pavilions. The north-most building is an auditorium. Next to it is the North Building, with the East Building sitting between the North Building and the rotunda. The main entrance to the East Building is flanked by two round silos that hold its elevators. A bridge over a sunken courtyard links the main entrance of the East Building to the main walkway that connects the auditorium and North Buildings to the rotunda. These buildings house the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI), the J. Paul Getty Trust and the Getty Foundation. These buildings are generally {{closed to the public}} except for special events held in the auditorium. They are linked to the Museum both by landscaped terraces and by an enclosed glass walkway that <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> the main rotunda.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} {{of the many}} rooms are the state apartments. These were laid out from the 16th century onwards, and were {{enhanced}} {{in the style of}} those at Versailles during the 18th century. In the 19th century and again during the late 20th century, large-scale restoration of the state rooms consolidated the 18th-century style which prevails today. Designed as an enfilade and a ceremonial route to the throne room, the processional route begins with an external horseshoe-shaped staircase which <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> the court of honour to the open gallery known as the Gallery of Hercules. From here guests enter the Mirror Gallery, a long hall inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. This gallery leads to the first of the state rooms, the Officer's Room, where guests are greeted by court officials before an audience with the prince in the Throne Room. From the Officer's Hall the enfilade continues to the Blue Room. This large drawing room, decorated with blue brocade, is hung with Grimaldi family portraits and has chandeliers of Murano glass. The following room, the largest of the state apartments, is the Throne Room. Its ceiling and frescoes were executed by Orazio de Ferrari and depict the surrender of Alexander the Great. The throne, in the Empire style, is positioned on a dais, beneath a red silk canopy of estate surmounted by a gilt crown. The floors are of Carrara marble. All state ceremonies have been held in this room since the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} eight tracks and four island platforms. According to the New York City Transit Authority, {{this makes it}} one of the world's largest {{elevated}} transportation terminals, as well as the largest in North America. The westernmost tracks, tracks 5‚Äì8, gradually slope downward, so tracks 1‚Äì4 are slightly higher than tracks 5‚Äì8 at the station's south end. There are ADA-compliant ramps from the three easternmost platforms (the Culver, Brighton, and Sea Beach Lines' platforms, respectively) to the main station building below the platforms; a non-ADA-compliant ramp <b>leads</b> <b>from</b> the West End Line (eastern) platform, with steps. An ADA-compliant elevator at the northern end of the West End Line platform leads to an overpass that connects to another ADA-compliant elevator at the northern end of the Sea Beach Line's platform. There are also stairways down to the station building. The southern two-thirds of the station is under the solar-panel-covered roof, while the northern third of the station is in the open air, not covered by anything. The shed is lit up by platform floodlights during the night hours.|$|E
