5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1980s, several studies {{suggested}} a link between children's consumption of aspirin and Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal disease. By 1986, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required warning <b>labels</b> <b>on</b> all aspirin, further suppressing sales. The makers of Tylenol also {{filed a lawsuit against}} Anacin aspirin maker American Home Products, claiming that the failure to add warning labels before 1986 had unfairly held back Tylenol sales, though this suit was eventually dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The {{botanic garden}} {{may be an}} {{independent}} institution, a governmental operation, or affiliated to a college or university.

It is not merely a landscaped or ornamental garden, although it may be artistic, nor is it an experiment station or yet a park with <b>labels</b> <b>on</b> the plants. The essential element is the intention of the enterprise, which is the acquisition and dissemination of botanical knowledge.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Apple {{agreed to}} cut the price UK {{consumers}} pay to download music for their iPods after a formal complaint to the European Commission from the UK consumer group Which? demonstrated higher prices in UK for the same iTunes songs sold elsewhere in the European Union (EU). The Commission began an antitrust investigation in 2007 of Apple's business practices after the complaint was made, but ultimately the Commission probe found no agreements between Apple and major record <b>labels</b> <b>on</b> how iTunes is run in Europe, only that Apple had been paying higher wholesale prices to UK music labels and was passing the cost along to UK customers.|$|E

5|$|Watch the Throne was {{released}} by Roc-A-Fella Records, Roc Nation, and Def Jam Recordings, Jay-Z's and West's respective record <b>labels.</b> <b>On</b> July 4, 2011 it was made available to pre-order on Life + Times, Jay-Z's lifestyle webzine, which redirected to Island Def Jam's website that featured the deluxe version available for $16.99, standard CD for $13.99, a deluxe digital version for $14.99, and standard digital album for $11.99. On July 22, its pre-order was made available on the iTunes Store. Internationally the album {{was released}} digitally on August 8 exclusively through iTunes, while its physical release was made available on August 12. Its deluxe CD edition was sold exclusively by Best Buy through August 23, when it became available at other retailers. The sales strategy received criticism from other retailers, who accused the labels of giving preferential treatment to iTunes and Best Buy. One of the most anticipated releases in 2011, Watch the Throne {{became one of the}} few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak.|$|E
