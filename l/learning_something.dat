25|$|It {{is an old}} {{trick of}} the Indian Office to blacken the {{character}} of any Indian that happens, notwithstanding the retardation caused by the Indian Bureau, to rise a little above the ranks. So as soon as an educated Indian begins to deplore the conditions of his brother Indians, the Indian Office dubs such a one a disturber, an agitator, and lately he {{is placed in the}} Bolshevik class. The whole Indian Bureau system of managing Indian business {{to the detriment of the}} Indian but for the benefit of a few greedy and voracious whites, is the most dramatic autocracy in existence the world over. Gradually through assistance of the American press, the generous hearted and justice loving American people are <b>learning</b> <b>something</b> of this present day Indian government humbuggery and deceit practiced by the Indian Office forces.|$|E
25|$|From his {{writings}} and {{the testimony of}} all who knew him, Ryelandt appears first and foremost as {{a man with a}} great sense of duty. Duty towards God above all: he was a deeply religious man, who tried to go to mass every day, who was knowledgeable about his religion, and who conceived of his music making as a religious duty. Duty towards his music: he was privileged in being able to devote himself exclusively to music, but he was highly conscious this was a privilege and worked very hard, both as a student of Tinel (who drove him hard) and as a composer. Towards his family: he was always extremely solicitous of his wife, but especially during her illness, when he would organize serenades for her as she could no longer attend concerts; he made time for his children, considering their education extremely important, and encouraging them; and he was “Bon-Papa Musique” for his grandchildren, for whom he played his Scènes Enfantines. Towards his students, whose work he corrected with respect instead of denigrating it, and who greatly appreciated his teaching qualities: “Even though he followed the classical method of teaching harmony and counterpoint …, you never had the impression that you were <b>learning</b> <b>something</b> boring,” wrote one of them.|$|E

500|$|Chief among Burroughs' {{complaints}} was Long's {{questioning of}} the role of instinct in animal <b>learning,</b> <b>something</b> that Burroughs and many scientists of the day accepted without doubt. Long had written that after many years of studying wild animals, he was [...] "convinced that instinct plays a much smaller part than we have supposed; that an animal's success or failure in the ceaseless struggle for life depends, not upon instinct, but upon the kind of training which the animal learns from its mother." [...] In reply to this assertion, Burroughs wrote in [...] "Real and Sham Natural History": [...] "The crows do not train their young. They have no fortresses, or schools, or colleges, or examining boards, or diplomas, or medals of honor, or hospitals, or churches, or telephones, or postal deliveries, or anything of the sort. Indeed, the poorest backwoods hamlet has more of the appurtenances of civilization than the best organized crow or other wild animal community in the land!" [...] Burroughs summed up by deeming Long a fraud, stating that his [...] "book reads like that {{of a man who has}} really never been to the woods, but who sits in his study and cooks up these yarns from things he has read in Forest and Stream, or in other sporting journals. Of real observation there is hardly a vestige in his book; of deliberate trifling with natural history there is no end".|$|E
2500|$|In English many {{historical}} figures are still referred to {{with the family}} name first. This is especially the case in scholarly works about Japan. Many scholarly works use Japanese order with Japanese names in general, and a scholarly work {{is more likely to}} use Japanese order if the author is a Japanologist. John Power, author of [...] "Japanese names," [...] wrote [...] "People who can speak and read Japanese have a strong resistance to switching Japanese names to the Western order." [...] Books written by these authors often have notes stating that Japanese names are in the original order. Some books do not have consistent naming order practices. Shizuka Saeki of Look Japan said, [...] "This is not only a headache for writers and translators, it is also a source of confusion for readers." [...] Lynne E. Riggs of the Society of Writers, Editors and Translators (SWET), a professional writing organization headquartered in Tokyo, said, [...] "When you publish a book about Japan, you are publishing it {{for people who want to}} know about Japan.

2500|$|Reviewing {{the world}} premiere, Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle lauded The Classical Style as an [...] "exuberantly witty and often {{touching}} one-act opera" [...] and wrote, [...] "There has {{been plenty of}} musicology written about opera, the brilliant pianist and writer Jeremy Denk points out, but never an opera about musicology. Now he and composer Steven Stucky have rectified that oversight in glorious fashion." [...] Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times similarly called it an [...] "illuminating, academic, occasionally combative, close study of the musical style of Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven by a brilliant pianist and scholar who died in 2012." [...] Richard Scheinin of the San Jose Mercury News declared it a [...] "winning little opera" [...] and further described it as [...] "gorgeous to hear, and filled with laughs." [...] Reviewing the New York City premiere, Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times wrote, [...] "It’s {{hard to say what}} the future holds for The Classical Style. But even those who lack understanding of the rudiments of harmony would surely enjoy it, while also <b>learning</b> <b>something</b> in the most entertaining way." [...] Simon Williams of Opera News also praised the work, saying: ...|$|E
