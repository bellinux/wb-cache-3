30|$|Normally, OBF has {{a better}} <b>lubricating</b> <b>property</b> {{compared}} to WBF (Bourgoyne et al. 1986). This property can reduce friction between solid contact points and decrease the seal integrity. On the other hand, with the same drilling fluid density, OBF tends to have more solid weight fraction (and volume fraction) than WBF because it contains low-density base fluid. Potentially, the presence of barite particles remaining in the diluted OBF promoted the LCM sealing performance, forming a stronger solid seal and overcoming the lubricating effect. The simple 7 % bentonite WBF containing only bentonite particles and water, with the same LCM treatment with OBF, could not perform {{as well as the}} OBF. At this point, the difference in <b>lubricating</b> <b>property</b> and solid volume fraction between WBF and OBF were believed to be the main factors affecting the sealing efficiency of both the base fluids.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the efficient boundary <b>lubricating</b> <b>properties</b> of human whole saliva (HWS) {{in a soft}} hydrophobic rubbing contact, consisting of a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) ball and a PDMS disk. The influence of applied load, entrainment speed and surface roughness was investigated for mechanically stimulated HWS. Lubrication by HWS results in a boundary friction coefficient of mu approximate to 0. 02, two orders of magnitude lower than that obtained for water. Dried saliva {{on the other hand}} results in mu approximate to 2 - 3, illustrating the importance of hydration for efficient salivary lubrication. Increasing the surface roughness increases the friction coefficient for HWS, while it decreases that for water. The boundary <b>lubricating</b> <b>properties</b> of HWS are less sensitive to saliva treatment than are its bulk viscoelastic properties. Centrifugation and ageing of HWS almost completely removes the shear thinning and elastic nature observed for fresh HWS. In contrast, the boundary friction coefficients are hardly affected, which indicates that the high-M (w) (supra-) molecular structures in saliva, which are expected to be responsible for its rheology, are not responsible for its boundary <b>lubricating</b> <b>properties.</b> The saliva-coated PDMS surfaces form an ideal model system for ex-vivo investigations into oral lubrication and how the <b>lubricating</b> <b>properties</b> of saliva are influenced by other components like food, beverages, oral care products and pharmaceuticals...|$|R

30|$|Lubricating oil can {{be easily}} {{polluted}} by water and emulsified, thereby negatively affecting the <b>lubricating</b> <b>property.</b> Meanwhile, wasted lubricating oil, a complex composition, presents high water content and exists with emulsion. A single technological method is difficult to be satisfied for efficient demulsification and dehydration of emulsified lubricating oil. In this paper, it is proposed that the swirl centrifugal field made by hydrocyclone, pulse electric field, and vacuum temperature field are coupled to achieve the oil’s dehydration. Based on the theories, {{it is reasonable to}} use three fields for oil’s demulsification. In the experiment of three-field dehydrating, the demulsification device is divided into two parts, namely, the coupled unit of pulse electric field and hydrocyclone, and the vacuum heating unit. The structure and size of the device were optimized through numerical simulation. With two modes of single field and three-field, the experiments were carried out. Results indicated that the use of three-field was more energy efficient and faster compared with the traditional vacuum heating method only.|$|E
