25|$|A {{diminishing}} U.S. fleet {{contrasted with}} the burgeoning of international sea trade. For example, worldwide demand for natural gas led {{to the growth of}} the global liquefied natural gas (<b>LNG)</b> <b>tanker</b> fleet, which reached 370 vessels as of 2007. In 2007 the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) set uniform LNG training standards at U.S. maritime training facilities. While short-term imports are declining, longer term projections signal an eightfold increase in U.S. imported LNG by 2025, the worldwide LNG fleet does not include a single U.S. flagged vessel. Moreover, only five U.S. deepwater LNG ports were operational in 2007, although permits have been issued for four additional ports, according to MARAD.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept for}} the {{aircraft}} {{began in the}} 1990s with a forecast programme cost of US$10 billion (early published figures were US$4–5.5B) and called for the first aircraft to be built before 2000. With an estimated price per unit of about US$160–200 million (an earlier published estimate was US$150 million) the market was forecast {{for a total of}} 300 aircraft, with production planned for the Kazan Aircraft Production Association facility. Initially designed for the carriage of passengers, later a KR-860T (T stands for Tanker) version was proposed for use as an aerial Liquefied natural gas (<b>LNG)</b> <b>tanker</b> for far-north regions. Taking advantage of the presence of LNG on the aircraft, the design proposed using LNG to fuel the turbines, rather than conventional Jet fuel, like on the Tupolev Tu-206.|$|E

50|$|For some {{specific}} voyages, such as named voyages (i.e. from A to B) and for specialist ships, like <b>LNG</b> <b>tankers</b> (a highly specialized {{sector of the}} tanker market), freight rates can be agreed on a lumpsum (or dollar per ton) fixed rate between both parties. {{but it is very}} hard nowadays. there is no scope.|$|R
50|$|The major {{difficulty}} {{in the use}} of natural gas is transportation. Natural gas pipelines are economical and common on land and across medium-length stretches of water (like Langeled, Interconnector and Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline), but are impractical across large oceans. Liquefied natural gas (<b>LNG)</b> <b>tanker</b> ships, railway tankers, and tank trucks are also used.|$|E
5000|$|GLNG is a {{liquefied}} {{natural gas}} (LNG) plant in Queensland, Australia. It is a leading project in the conversion of coal seam gas (coalbed methane) into LNG.

50|$|The Canaport LNG {{terminal}} is a liquified {{natural gas}} (LNG) receiving and regasification terminal located adjacent and immediately east of the Canaport crude receiving terminal. Commissioned in 2008, it is Canada's first LNG terminal and the first LNG terminal built in eastern North America in 30 years. It is capable of receiving the largest <b>LNG</b> <b>tankers</b> in the world.|$|R

50|$|Until 1979, {{peak loads}} of LNG was being {{imported}} via four terminals, {{located in the}} continental United States. After 1979, the import volume declined dramatically, and the terminals were either mothballed or underutilized for two decades. The El Paso <b>LNG</b> <b>tankers</b> were all laid up to rust in 1980.

50|$|LNG {{shipping}} {{first became}} a possibility in 1959 when the Methane Pioneer, a converted WWII freighter safely transported Liquefied Natural Gas into the United Kingdom. After proving that LNG {{can be safely}} transported across the ocean, the LMG shipping industry boomed and now employs 200 billion dollars annually in capita. Since {{the start of the}} LNG industry in 1964, international trade has increased 50 times over, production capacity has increased 10 times over, and individual ship capacity has increased 5 times over. The <b>LNG</b> <b>tanker</b> design was initially created by Worm’s and Co. This design is now referred to as the Gaz Transport Design. The tanks were initially created to hold 34,000 cubic meters, but the design has transformed into 71,500 cubic meters. Spherical LNG tanks showed up in 1973, when Hoegh built the Norman Lady. Spherical tanks are common among modern LNG vessels. In 1999, Samsung Heavy Ind. created the largest New Membrane-type LNG carrier of its time. She was the largest single hull vessel of her time, with a length of 278.8 meters, and the capability of 20.7 knots.The Artic Princess, delivered in 2006, was the largest <b>LNG</b> <b>tanker</b> ever created. She is 288 meters long, and has a capacity of 147,000 cubic meters.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{detailed}} and comprehensive complementarity model for computing market equilibrium values in the European natural gas system. Market players include producers and their marketing arms which we call "traders", pipeline and storage operators, marketers, <b>LNG</b> liquefiers, regasifiers, <b>tankers,</b> and three end-use consumption sectors. The economic behavior of producers, traders, pipeline and storage operators, liquefiers and regasifiers is modeled via optimization problems whose Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions in combination with market-clearing conditions form the complementarity system. The <b>LNG</b> <b>tankers,</b> marketers and consumption sectors are modeled implicitly via appropriate cost functions, aggregate demand curves, and ex post calculations, respectively. The model is run on several case studies that highlight its capabilities, including a simulation of a disruption of Russian supplies via Ukraine. ...|$|R
