40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} rearing 10 â€“ 15 -day- and 0. 7 â€“ 1. 5 -month-old seahorse Hippocampus kuda in illuminated sea cages to continue existing hatchery protocols to mass produce H. kuda for trade and enhance depleted wild stocks in their natural habitats. Thawed Acetes (a planktonic crustacean abundant in inshore seas) was fed to juvenile seahorses in lighted and unlighted sea cages while one group in <b>lighted</b> <b>cages</b> was not fed Acetes. After 10 â€“ 12 weeks of rearing, both mean body weight and stretch height increased in all treatment groups, with lighted cage-reared seahorses fed Acetes being heavier (2 g) and longer (8 cm) {{than the other two}} treatment groups. Although instantaneous growth rates declined during the rearing period, these were generally higher among Acetes-fed seahorses in <b>lighted</b> <b>cages</b> (0. 02 â€“ 0. 07) compared with those in the unlighted cages with Acetes and <b>lighted</b> <b>cages</b> without Acetes feeding. Mean survivorship in all groups ranged from 9 % to 74 % after the trials, but mean survivorship of juveniles in <b>lighted</b> <b>cages</b> with Acetes feeding (9 â€“ 74 %) was consistently lower than the two treatment groups as a likely result of crustacean and piscine predators being attracted by light and the odour of leftover Acetes in the <b>lighted</b> <b>cages.</b> These results demonstrate that light-attracted zooplankton prey supplemented by Acetes feeding may provide essential nutrients for the growth of H. kuda juveniles in illuminated sea cages. With further improvement in the grow-out protocol, it may provide a possible alternative livelihood to seahorse fishers and sufficient seed to re-populate depleted wild stocks of H. kuda.

40|$|SummaryPhotocontrol of {{functional}} peptides {{is a powerful}} tool for spatial and temporal control of cell signaling events. We show that the genetically encoded light-sensitive LOV 2 domain of Avena Sativa phototropin 1 (AsLOV 2) can be used to reversibly photomodulate the affinity of peptides for their binding partners. Sequence analysis and molecular modeling were used to embed two peptides into the Jα helix of the AsLOV 2 domain while maintaining AsLOV 2 structure in the dark but allowing for binding to effector proteins when the Jα helix unfolds in the <b>light.</b> <b>Caged</b> versions of the ipaA and SsrA peptides, LOV-ipaA and LOV-SsrA, bind their targets with 49 - and 8 -fold enhanced affinity in the light, respectively. These switches can be used as general tools for light-dependent colocalization, which we demonstrate with photo-activable gene transcription in yeast...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{reports have}} shown that 1 -(4, 5 -dimethoxy- 2 -nitro-phenyl) ethyl ester (DMNPE) adducts coupled to DNA {{plasmids}} block transcription in vitro and in vivo until removed with light. In this report, we explore the use of DMNPE to control DNA hybridization. We found that DMNPE-caged oligonucleotides have changed spectrophotometric and elec-trophoretic properties that can be restored with <b>light</b> exposure. <b>Caged</b> oligonucleotides have slower electrophoretic mobility than noncaged oligonucleotides and caged oligonu-cleotides exposed to <b>light.</b> Effects of <b>caging</b> on hybridization were assessed in a fluorescence-based assay using a 20 mer caged DNA oligonucleotide complementary to a 30 mer mo-lecular beacon. Fluorescence results indicate that hybridiza-tion is reduced and subsequently restored by light. Subsequent gel shift assays confirmed these results. Hybridization activity of caged oligonucleotides {{with an average of}} 14 – 16 DMNPE adducts per oligonucleotide was 14 % of noncaged control oligonucleotides and after 365 nm photolysis, increased to nearly 80 % of controls. Spectrophotometric characterization of caged oligonucleotides exposed to light and then filtered to remove the released DMNPE adducts indicates two to four attached cage groups remaining following photoactivation. These results suggest that this light-based technology {{can be used as a}} tool for the spatial and temporal regulation of hybridization-based DNA bioactivity...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA novel {{fluorescence}} probe {{suitable for}} the study of nuclear import in living cells has been developed.

Following irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) <b>light,</b> the <b>caged</b> NLS conjugate translocated into and accumulated in the nucleus within 20 min similar to uncaged NLS conjugate. Maximum import rate saturated approximately 4. 78 ± 0. 21 % per minute when the duration of irradiation was more than 1 / 15 s (22 mW/cm 2). Caged NLS conjugate tended to distribute near the surface of the nucleus, and this association became stronger after UV irradiation.

40|$|Experimental {{tests were}} {{conducted}} using hatchery reared and wild juvenile chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, eastern brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, and rainbow trout O. mykiss to determine specific behavior responses to infrasound (< 20 Hz) and flashing strobe <b>lights.</b> <b>Caged</b> fish were acclimated in a static test tank and their behavior was recorded using low light cameras. Species specific behavior was characterized by measuring movements of the fish within the cage as well as observing startle and habituation responses. Wild chinook salmon (40 - 45 mm) and hatchery reared chinook salmon (45 - 50 mm) exhibited avoidance responses when initially exposed to a 10 Hz volume displacement source. Rainbow and eastern brook trout (25 - 100 mm) did not respond with avoidance or other behaviors to infrasound. Habituation to the infrasound source was evident for chinook salmon during repeated exposures. Wild and hatchery chinook displayed {{a higher proportion of}} movement during the initial exposures to infrasound when the acclimation period in the test tank was 2 - 3 h as compared to a 12 - 15 h acclimation period. A flashing strobe light produced higher and more consistent movement rates in wild chinook (60 % of the tests); hatchery reared chinook salmon (50 %) and rainbow trout (80 %). No measurable movement or other responses was observed for eastern brook trout. Little if any habituation was observed during repeated exposures to strobe lights. Results from this study indicate that consistent repeatable responses can be elicited from some fish using high intensity strobe lights under a controlled laboratory testing. The specific behaviors observed in these experiments might be used to predict how fish might react to low frequency sound and strobe lights in a screening facility. Because sub-yearling salmonids and resident species are susceptible from becoming entrained at water diversion structures we conducted tests in conjunction with our evaluation of juvenile fish screening facilities. This is the reason our tests focused on fry life stages...|$|R
