5|$|While in {{town with}} the Mistress, Lad saves her from {{an attack by}} a sick dog being chased {{by the police and}} other citizens, who believe it to be rabid. The dog is shot and the upset Mistress, who knew it was not really rabid, goes home. The next day, the town constable comes by boat to the Place to execute Lad under the notion that he is now rabid. The Master argues that the other dog was not rabid and refuses to allow Lad to be shot, {{ordering}} the officer off his property. As the man is leaving, his boat overturns. Unable to swim, he is in danger of drowning until Lad jumps in and brings him back to shore. The grateful officer states that he killed the dog he came to kill and Lad only <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like him.|$|E

500|$|However, Roger Ebert {{argued the}} film was a [...] "glum, lackluster movie in which even the big effects {{sequences}} seem dutiful instead of exhilarating." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brandon Routh lacks charisma as Superman", surmising that he [...] "may have been cast because he <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like Reeve". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that Warner Bros. should have rebooted the series {{along the lines of}} Batman Begins. He also felt Bosworth, at 22 years old, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154-minute-long film".|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Cumberbatch {{provided}} {{the voice and}} motion-capture for both Smaug the Dragon and the Necromancer in , the first instalment of The Hobbit film series {{based on the novel}} by J. R. R. Tolkien. He reprised his roles as Smaug and the Necromancer for [...] (2013) and [...] (2014). For the motion-capture aspect of the films, he used a suit and facial markers to highlight the dragon's expressions and movements. Cumberbatch told Total Film [...] "You just have to lose your shit on a carpeted floor, in a place that <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit like a mundane government building. It was just me as well, with four static cameras and all the sensors." ...|$|E
500|$|She had {{directed}} the detailed planning of the funeral, which included scheduling {{all the major}} events and asking former President George H. W. Bush, as well as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, former Soviet Union Leader Mikhail Gorbachev, and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to speak during the National Cathedral Service. She paid very {{close attention to the}} details, something she had always done in her husband's life. Betsy Bloomingdale, one of Reagan's closest friends, stated, [...] "She <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> frail. But she is very strong inside. She is. She has the strength. She is doing her last thing for Ronnie. And she is going to get it right." [...] The funeral marked her first major public appearance since she delivered a speech to the 1996 Republican National Convention on her husband's behalf.|$|E

500|$|For the film, cinematographer Russell Carpenter used a 1.85 {{aspect ratio}} shot with Arri Alexa XT and M cameras, using the M for fight {{sequences}} and helicopter filming. Camera operator Peter Rosenfeld said, [...] "Russell and Peyton's decision to shoot in 1.85 {{was a good}} call, since at 2.35 there's insufficient height in frame to appreciate the vertical aspects of [...] going from standing full-size to falling {{through a crack in}} the floor." [...] Carpenter and Technicolor also devised a lookup table (LUT) to darken the color palette. Carpenter said, [...] "For a lot of recent comedies I've kept my LUTs kind of 'Kodak' – saturated and upbeat. But this show needed something different that affected skin tones and the Ant-Man suit, which dates back to the 1980s, so it <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> run-down. What I loved about this LUT was how it allowed the costume to retain the color but took it from fire-engine red to something a little more weathered." ...|$|E
500|$|Burton {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that he enjoyed the plot twist, and compared it to Jason Morgan being Monica Quartermaine's (Leslie Charleson) son on General Hospital. He said that he felt a connection while working with Scott, stating: [...] "There is vulnerability there between us, and it’s not on purpose. It’s just something that is there. It was actually kind of there before it happened that we were on-screen mother and son." [...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she has come up with a good way of having everyone informed in the kindest way possible. If it were me, I would think, [...] "I can only go through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time and get it over with." [...] Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up." [...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants everyone to be happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does." ...|$|E
500|$|Crash's {{aesthetic}} {{design in}} the games developed by Radical Entertainment has received mixed reactions from reviewers. Brian Rowe of Game Revolution noted that Crash's fingerless gloves have been replaced with [...] "equally outdated" [...] tribal tattoos and that Crash's personality had been altered from his [...] "obnoxiously extreme attitude" [...] {{to that of a}} [...] "bluthering, googly-eyed idiot". Although Rowe wondered when and why the change happened, he concluded that [...] "it's better than the popular goatee-of-rage that so many other platform giants are sporting these days". Arnold Katayev of PSX Extreme, while admitting that the character detail on Crash was [...] "pretty nice", expressed unhappiness with the artistic choices made for the character; he described Crash's tribal tattoos as [...] "a little pretentious" [...] and noted that the increased definition on his mohawk patch made Crash come off as [...] "trying too hard to be cool". He added that Crash's new fighting style begot a stance that consists of Crash [...] "putting up his dukes like a boxer", which he deemed [...] "out of character" [...] for Crash. Finally, while critiquing the voice acting in Crash of the Titans, he remarked that Crash [...] "especially sounds awful, largely because he doesn't actually speak - he just blabs annoying gibberish, which makes him sound like he's an infant". Matt Keller of PALGN also criticized Crash's voice, which he said made Crash sound [...] "like a confused baby". Louis Bedigian of GameZone stated that [...] "Crash's character design has gone from cool to goofy and now to the dreaded place of being dorky" [...] and said that the minute and gradual changes made to Crash's design throughout the series [...] "have really hurt Crash's appearance as a leading game character". GamePro named Crash's new design as the second worst video game character makeover ever. Craig Harris of IGN was more positive on Crash's new appearance and noted that Crash [...] "looks a little floofier and a lot edgier, gaining a spikier Mohawk and trading in his fingerless gloves for tribal ink all up and down his arms" [...] while comparing his incoherent squawking vocalizations to Kazooie of the Banjo-Kazooie series. He concluded that [...] "ultimately he's been changed for the better. He <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cooler and more appealing than his more 'Japanese-inspired' edits over the years".|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, DeVille {{married his}} second wife, Lisa Leggett, who {{proved to be}} an astute {{business}} manager. On the strength of his success touring and selling albums in Europe, they bought a horse farm, Casa de Sueños, in Picayune, Mississippi and began living there as well as at their apartment and studio in the French Quarter of New Orleans. DeVille told an interviewer in 1996: [...] "I finally got the plantation... I just bought this house and [...] It <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit like Graceland... I got into horses since my wife is into them. We're raising Spanish and Portuguese bullfighting horses. The bloodline is 2000 years old. She's into breeding, but I just love riding. I've also got five dogs, four cats and a partridge in a pear tree." ...|$|E
2500|$|Renata Adler of the New York Times {{wrote that}} [...] "the characters– {{including}} Savelyeva [...] who <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> queasy, and Bondarchuk, {{too old to}} play Pierre– are dowdy automata." [...] She added the film was [...] "vulgar {{in the sense that}} it takes something great and makes it both pretentious and devoid of life [...] A failure {{in the sense that it}} is not even as enjoyable as any number of lesser films." [...] Adler also disapproved of the English dubbing, opining [...] "although it is remarkable– an outer limit of what can be done– it was a mistake" [...] and [...] "proves once and for all the futility of dubbing." [...] The New Yorker critic Penelope Gilliatt had lambasted the process as well: [...] "the decision to tack on alien voices seems madness." [...] Judith Crist wrote in New York Magazine: [...] "Those Russians…! And now, I bet they'll beat us to the moon! Chauvinism be damned– I'm putting Gone with the Wind into historic perspective and second place, for certainly War and Peace is not only [...] the finest epic of our time, but also a great and noble translation of a literary masterpiece, surpassing our expectation and imagination".|$|E

2500|$|The film {{currently}} holds a 72% [...] "Fresh" [...] {{rating on}} the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 46 reviews, which made its critical reception above average but {{much lower than}} The Evil Dead and Evil Dead II, which received 96% and 98% respectively. On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 57 out of 100, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews". Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars and wrote, [...] "The movie isn't as funny or entertaining as Evil Dead II, however, maybe because the comic approach seems recycled." [...] In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin praised, [...] "Mr. Campbell's manly, mock-heroic posturing is perfectly {{in keeping with the}} director's droll outlook." [...] Desson Howe, in this review for The Washington Post praised the film's style: [...] "Bill Pope's cinematography is gymnastic and appropriately frenetic. The visual and make-up effects (from artist-technicians William Mesa, Tony Gardner and others) are incredibly imaginative." [...] However, Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "C+" [...] rating and wrote, [...] "This spoofy cast of thousands <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too much like a crew of bland Hollywood extras. By the time Army of Darkness turns into a retread of Jason and the Argonauts, featuring an army of fighting skeletons, the film has fallen into a ditch between parody and spectacle." ...|$|E
2500|$|For 1972, the Torino was {{redesigned}} using many characteristics {{carried over}} from the previous generation. The 1972 Torino styling emphasized the [...] "long hood short deck" [...] look and had strong elements of coke bottle styling. [...] The Torino line was also revised to {{be made up of}} basic models called [...] "Torino" [...] and more upscale models called [...] "Gran Torinos." [...] The most radical change was a large eggcrate grille in an oval opening on Gran Torinos. Tom McCahill, stated [...] "the gaping grille <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like it was patterned after Namu, the killer whale", but also stated that the Torino had [...] "kind of pleasing, no-nonsense styling." [...] Gran Torinos had chrome bezels surrounding the headlamps {{on each side of the}} large oval grille. [...] Base Torinos had a full width argent eggcrate grille that surrounded the headlights. Base Torinos also used a unique hood and front bumper differentiating it from the Gran Torino models. The Torino's front fenders were flared around the wheel opening and the rear quarter panel had strong character line extending to the rear bumper. The windshield had a more rakish 60-degree angle, while the A-pillars and roof were thinner. Even with this changes, structural integrity remained the same as 1971 models. The rear featured a full width bumper that incorporated thin rectangular tail lights into each bumper end. [...] All Torinos had [...] "DirectAire" [...] ventilation as standard equipment resulting in vent windows vanishing from four-door and station wagon models. [...] The Torino incorporated new safety features for 1972, including new flush mount door handles and side door guard rails.|$|E
