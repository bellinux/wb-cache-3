40|$|In hot {{and warm}} forging, the surface layers of dies at the tool-workpiece {{interface}} {{are exposed to}} high mechanical stress cycles and severe temperatures caused by process operating conditions (such as the forging temperature, cooling policy and <b>lubricating</b> <b>tool</b> surfaces) and characteristics of the forging system. Among these characteristics, the elasticity of the forming machine and the contact-time are particularly important for {{their impact on the}} service life of the dies. This paper presents an experimental approach to evaluate the influence that the press characteristics, such as the total stiffness and contact-time under pressure, have on temperature distribution at the die surface during hot forging cycles. The experimental apparatus is presented together with the procedure and results of forging experiments that were carried out to validate the approach when applied to a forging system based on a screw press...|$|E

40|$|Spent {{metal removal}} fluid (cutting fluid, lubricant, coolant, etc.) is a {{significant}} waste stream from the metal fabrication industry. The quantity of waste generated {{and the cost of}} fluid purchases could be reduced by microlubrication (minimum quantity lubrication, mist lubrication) methods of fluid delivery. In microlubrication, a fine cutting fluid mist is used, rather than the traditional method of flooding the cutting tool ??? workpiece interface. The metal fabrication industry is concerned that the use of microlubrication might reduce tool life negatively impacting production and increasing manufacturing costs. The purpose of this research was to compare the performance (tool life) of cutting <b>tools</b> <b>lubricated</b> and cooled using microlubrication with that of cutting <b>tools</b> <b>lubricated</b> and cooled using traditional flood application. The performance difference identified is used to calculate and compare the economic impact of microlubrication versus flood application. Discussion is also presented comparing the effect of microlubrication and flood application on the cost of fluid purchased and disposal. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
40|$|Oil {{in water}} (O/W) {{emulsions}} are utilized extensively for cooling and <b>lubricating</b> cutting <b>tools</b> during parts machining. A robust Lattice Boltzmann (LBM) thermal-surfactants model, {{which provides a}} useful platform for exploring complex emulsionsâ€™ characteristics under variety of flow conditions, is used here {{for the study of}} the fluid behavior during conventional tools cooling. The transient thermal capabilities of the model are employed for simulating the effects of the flow conditions of O/W emulsions on the cooling of cutting tools. The model results show that the temperature outcome is slightly affected by reversing the direction of upper plate (workpiece). On the other hand, an important increase in effective viscosity is seen which supports better lubrication during the work...|$|R
40|$|Enabling the {{paradigm}} of quality by design requires the ability to quantitatively correlate material properties and process variables to measureable product performance attributes. In this study, we show how heterogeneities in compacted ribbon densities quantitatively correlate to tablet mechanical properties. These density variations, which have been purposely modulated by internal and external lubrications, are characterized longitudinally and transversally by nondestructive ultrasonic and X-ray micro-computed tomography measurements. Subsequently, different transversal regions of the compacted ribbon are milled under the same conditions, and granules with nominally the same particle size distribution are utilized to manufacture cylindrical tablets, whose mechanical properties are further analyzed by ultrasonic measurements. We consider three different ribbon conditions: no lubrication (case 1); lubricated powder (case 2); and <b>lubricated</b> <b>tooling</b> (hopper, side sealing plates, feed screws, and rolls) (case 3). This study quantitatively reveals that variation in local densities in ribbons (for case 1) and process conditions (i. e., internal case 2 and external lubrication case 3) during roller compaction significantly affect the mechanical properties of tablets even for granules with the same particle size distribution. For case 1, the mechanical properties of tablets depend on the spatial location where granules are produced. For cases 2 and 3, the ribbon density homogeneity was improved {{by the use of}} a lubricant. It is demonstrated that the mechanical performances of tablets are decreased due to applied lubricant and work-hardening phenomenon. Moreover, we extended our study to correlate the speed of sound to the tensile strength of the tablet. It is found that the speed of sound increases with the tensile strength for the tested tablets...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Electron Beam Melting (EBM) CoCrMo alloy is {{currently}} utilized {{for the production}} of joint replacements and fixation devices thanks to its high strength, good wear and corrosion resistance, and excellent biocompatibility.

40|$|Abstract. In {{cold work}} extrusion, {{lubricants}} {{play an important}} role in <b>lubricating</b> the <b>tool</b> and workpiece surfaces, preventing metal-to-metal contact and reducing sliding friction, so that the workpiece can be extruded smoothly without severe wear due to lubricant starvation. In this paper, the influence of lubricant viscosity in cold work forward extrusion was investigated. The lubricants were additive-free, paraffinic mineral oil, which may have low, medium or high viscosity. The workpiece material was pure aluminum A 1100, extruded with extrusion ratio of 3. The analysis focused on extrusion force, workpiece surface roughness after the extrusion process and the metal flow in the deformation zone of the workpiece. Using the visioplasticity method, the sliding velocity was calculated from the metal flow. Results showed that, the higher the lubricant viscosity, the lower the extrusion force generated. However, a high-viscosity lubricant produces coarser workpiece surface conditions after the extrusion process...|$|R

40|$|Coolants {{are widely}} used in {{industries}} for metal cutting operations. Though there are varieties of coolants available, {{the most widely used}} are water-soluble coolants because of their low cost and better heat dissipation compared to straight cutting oils. In the present investigation, amongst the various causes, which deteriorate the coolant, the role of hardness of water is primarily studied. Accordingly, water from different sources with varying hardness is considered and coolants are prepared from the same. The extent to which hardness can affect the performance of coolants is studied as a function of coolant lubricity in a reciprocating tribometer. Further, the effect of entry of coolants into <b>lubricated</b> machine <b>tool</b> slideways is also assessed by evaluating the mixture of coolant and lubricating oil for its frictional behavior. This is important from assessing the impact of the mixing of coolant and lubricating oil on machine tool slideways with regard to positioning exactness and stick slip behavior of slideways in terms of coolant-lube compatibility...|$|R
40|$|Tribological {{conditions}} between workpiece and tool have a {{major impact}} onto forming processes. Besides lubrication, temperature, and material, they are mainly influenced by the tool surface characteristics, especially by its topography, which is a result of finishing technology. Thereby formed lubricant pockets are of prime importance for the tribosystem due to its ability to separate the tribopartners by storing lubricant. The influence of four different tool finishing processes and their according surface topographies onto frictional behaviour have been investigated and quantified by the barrel compression test, in dry and <b>lubricated</b> tribosystems. The <b>tool</b> steel surfaces were stochastically microstructured by grinding and spark erosion as well as deterministic structured with micro calottes, applied by jet electrochemical machining and compared to a polished reference tool.

40|$|Carbon fibre {{composites}} are a {{key component}} of aircraft structures because of their enhanced material properties such as favourable strength to weight ratios when compared to metal alloys. During the assembly process of an aircraft, carbon fibre components are joined to other structures using rivets, bolts, and fasteners, and as part of the joining process, the components will need to be machined or drilled. Unlike metal alloys, composites are sensitive to heat and are vulnerable to internal structural damage from machining tools. They are also susceptible to a reduction in strength when fibres are exposed to moisture. In the machining process, carbon fibre composites may be drilled using oils to <b>lubricate</b> carbide machining <b>tools.</b> In this study, a description of the experimental apparatus is provided along with an investigation to determine the influence synthetic biodegradable lubricating oil has on drill rotational speed, drilling load, and drilling temperature when using a pneumatic drill to machine carbon fibre composite material...|$|R
40|$|MetalWorking Fluids (MWFs) {{are widely}} used to cool and <b>lubricate</b> {{machines}} and <b>tools.</b> By far, the most common MWFs are oil-in-water emulsions with oil concentration (C oil) {{in the range from}} 1 % to 10 %, depending on type of oil, material to be worked, etc. In order to optimize emulsion and machine performance, as well as for good waste policy, the right value of C oil should be kept (approximately) constant during the MWF's lifecycle to compensate inevitable changes due to water evaporation, bacterial attack, oil adhesion to metal parts, etc [...] This, however, requires periodic measurements, often skipped because they require unhandy operations and produce inaccurate results. In this context, a new system is presented that is based on the falling ball principle, normally used for viscosity measurements, shown to be suitable also for accurate C oil measurements.

40|$|A 3 -dimensional {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} analysis of minimum quantity lubricant flow for a four-tooth milling cutter operation with single and three nozzles is presented in this paper. CFD modelling is utilized to simulate the flow distribution around a four- tooth milling. The domain of a rotating cutter along with the spraying nozzle was defined. Operating cutting and boundary conditions were defined based on previous literature. A steady-state, pressure-based, planar analysis was performed with a viscous, realizable k-Îµ model. A 3 -D transient-case, incompressible analysis for the minimum quantity lubricant is also performed. The domain of the milling cutter is rotated {{at a very high}} spindle speed, and a single nozzle is used to investigate the effects of MQL spray. A mixture of oils and air is sprayed onto the tool. Another analysis is performed with three nozzles placed at equal angles to each other around the periphery of the tool. A 2 -dimensional steady-state analysis is also carried out using CFD. The obtained results verify that the single nozzle cannot fully <b>lubricate</b> the rotating <b>tool.</b> It was observed that flow penetration into the cutting zone is dependent on the flow velocity and the number of nozzles. Hence, it can be concluded that the MQL nozzle arrangement can be improved with three nozzles with a constant mass flow rate...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{describes}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} tribology during plane strain compression testing (PSCT) of aluminium strip with steel <b>tools.</b> <b>lubricated</b> by mineral base oils containing either stearic acid or aluminium stearate as additive in concentrations up to 0. 5 %. The present study is a follow-up {{to the work of}} Sutcliffe et al. [Boundary lubrication of aluminium strip during plane strain compression, Wear 254 (2003) 65 - 79]. The close conformance of the strip and tool indicate that boundary lubrication should {{play a significant role in}} the tribology. The new work supports the conclusions of the previous study, that for the first indent hydrodynamic influences are important, while additives do not affect friction. After a number of indentations a transfer layer builds up on the tool. Depending on the additive concentration and tool roughness, this may either lead to a rise or fall in friction factor. Scanning electron microscope and optical observations show how the transfer layer can either form a smooth mottled appearance which is easily removed using tissue paper for higher additive concentrations, or takes the form of strongly attached particles for lower additive concentrations or in the absence of additives. Similar behaviour is observed for the two types of additive. indicating that the stearate chain in the soap is able to react with the Fe-based tool as effectively as when it is part of the acid-and probably also with the Al strip...|$|R
40|$|Flood cooling is {{primarily}} used to cool and <b>lubricate</b> the cutting <b>tool</b> and workpiece interface during a machining process. But the {{adverse health effects}} caused {{by the use of}} flood coolants are drawing manufacturers' attention to develop methods for controlling occupational exposure to cutting fluids. Microlubrication serves as an alternative to flood cooling by reducing the volume of cutting fluid used in the machining process. Microlubrication minimizes the exposure of metal working fluids to the machining operators leading to an economical, safer and healthy workplace environment. In this dissertation, a vegetable based lubricant is used to conduct mist, microstructure and wear analyses during end milling AISI 1018 steel using microlubrication. A two-flute solid carbide cutting tool was used with varying cutting speed and feed rate levels with a constant depth of cut. A full factorial experiment with Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was conducted and regression models were generated along with parameter optimization for the flank wear, aerosol mass concentration and the aerosol particle size. MANOVA indicated that the speed and feed variables main effects are significant, but the interaction of (speed*feed) was not significant at 95 % confidence level. The model was able to predict 69. 44 %, 68. 06 % and 42. 90 % of the variation in the data for both the flank wear side 1 and 2 and aerosol mass concentration, respectively. An adequate signal-to-noise precision ratio more than 4 was obtained for the models, indicating adequate signal to use the model as a predictor for both the flank wear sides and aerosol mass concentration. The highest average mass concentration of 8. 32 mg/m 3 was realized using cutting speed of 80 Surface feet per minute (SFM) and a feed rate of 0. 003 Inches per tooth (IPT). The lowest average mass concentration of 5. 91 mg/m 3 was realized using treatment 120 SFM and 0. 005 IPT. The cutting performance under microlubrication is five times better in terms of tool life and two times better in terms of materials removal volume under low cutting speed and feed rate combination as compared to high cutting speed and feed rate combination. Abrasion was the dominant wear mechanism for all the cutting tools under consideration. Other than abrasion, sliding adhesive wear of the workpiece materials was also observed. The scanning electron microscope investigation of the used cutting tools revealed micro-fatigue cracks, welded micro-chips and unusual built-up edges on the cutting tools flank and rake side. Higher tool life was observed in the lowest cutting speed and feed rate combination. Transmission electron microscopy analysis at failure for the treatment 120 SFM and 0. 005 IPT helped to quantify the dislocation densities. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) identified 4 to 8 Âµm grain size growth on the machined surface due to residual stresses that are the driving force for the grain boundaries motion to reduce its overall energy resulting in the slight grain growth. EBSD also showed that (001) textured ferrite grains before machining exhibited randomly orientated grains after machining. The study shows that with a proper selection of the cutting parameters, it is possible to obtain higher tool life in end milling under microlubrication. But more scientific studies are needed to lower the mass concentration of the aerosol particles, below the recommended value of 5 mg/m 3 established by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ...|$|R
