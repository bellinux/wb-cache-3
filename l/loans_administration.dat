The paper employed panel data and multiple regression analysis to analyze a survey of 502 randomly selected enterprises finance by microfinance banks in Nigeria. We find strong evidence that access to microfinance does not enhance growth of micro and small enterprises in Nigeria. However, other firm level characteristics such as business size and business location, are found to have positive effect on enterprise growth.

40|$|<b>Loan</b> <b>administration</b> {{costs and}} the costs of search for {{information}} about risk are found to be determinants of spatial interest rate differentials. These costs are independent of dollar loan size; therefore, rational lending policies can produce higher interest rates (or lower term to maturity) in low-income communities. But the premium (lower maturity) should be related to lower loan size and risk differentials. Public policy should be directed toward compiling and verifying an information bank which would allow lenders to search efficiently for information about risk. An empirical methodology designed to test for mortgage deficiency in minority areas was developed through case studies. This indicated the utility of specifying the supply and demand for mortgages at the neighborhood level of aggregation. Trends in neighborhood property values were identified as important and overlooked measures of lending risk. Further exploration of the hypothesis that Spanish-speaking areas are mortgage deficient is suggested by the cases. Copyright American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association. ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, Japan has slowly entered into the process of bad debt restructuring. This process {{is taking place in}} two phases: an initial phase of bad debt restructuring, namely the {{consolidation}} of ownership of bad assets, which is now surfacing as bad asset receptors are being established; and a second phase, regarding the dispersion of ownership of bad assets, which has not yet emerged but will occur gradually over the next five years. The author explores a range of investment opportunities that are emerging as this restructuring process takes place. Particularly, two developments from last summer - the establishment of the Housing <b>Loan</b> <b>Administration</b> Corporation and the Resolution and Collection Bank - indicate that borrowers from Jusen companies and failed credit co-ops are no longer supported by the Japanese banking system. These borrowers, largely real estate developers many of whom are already technically insolvent, have been left with no other alternative but significant reorganization including the total liquidation of assets. Opportunities are arising from these bankruptcy/liquidation sales. Another area of opportunity lies in the increasing consolidation among banks, particularly among smaller shinking and second-tier regional banks which have been left without any specific official rescue packages due to the current political climate. As they consolidate there will be a further growth of opportunities for investors...|$|R
