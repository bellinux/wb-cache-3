5|$|Catherine of Braganza {{brought the}} Portuguese habit of tea to England around 1660. Initially, its expense {{restricted}} it to wealthy consumers, {{but the price}} gradually dropped, until by the 19th century its use was widespread. Introduced in the 16th century, coffee became popular by the 17th century, especially in the coffee houses, the first opening in Oxford in 1650. Hot chocolate was a popular drink by the 17th century, <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> {{was used as a}} food. Chocolate bars were developed and marketed by three English Quaker-founded businesses, Joseph Fry's (1847), Rowntree's (1862), and Cadbury's (1868).|$|E

5|$|The {{duration}} of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed gratification. A 2001 study demonstrated {{that if a}} reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, {{the bulk of the}} participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> is judged to be not worth the effort it takes to wait.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1944, with an Allied {{invasion}} of Nazi-occupied Europe becoming ever more likely, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel {{was assigned to}} improve the wall's defences. Believing the existing coastal fortifications to be entirely inadequate, he immediately began strengthening them. Rommel's main concern was Allied air power. He had seen it first-hand when fighting the British and Americans in North Africa, and it had left a profound impression on him. He feared that any German counterattack would be broken up by Allied aircraft <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> could make a difference. Under his direction, hundreds of reinforced concrete pillboxes were built on the beaches, or sometimes slightly inland, to house machine guns, antitank guns, and light and heavy artillery. Land mines and antitank obstacles were planted on the beaches, and underwater obstacles and naval mines were placed in waters just offshore. The intent was to destroy the Allied landing craft before they could unload on the beaches.|$|E
5|$|Arlene then {{entered the}} Gulf of Mexico later that {{afternoon}} and strengthened further to its peak strength of 70mph (110km/h). The official forecast at this time called for further intensification to minimal hurricane strength. This did not occur however and Arlene instead weakened as result of dry air entering the circulation. The storm made landfall just west of Pensacola, Florida in the afternoon of June 11 as a moderate tropical storm with winds of 60mph (95km/h). As most of the convection of the storm were located north and east of the center, most {{of the effects of}} the storm were on land <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> made landfall. Arlene was the most intense landfalling June storm since Hurricane Allison hit the same location as a strong tropical storm during the 1995 season. Arlene weakened into a tropical depression later that day, but managed to persist as a tropical system as it moved north over the United States. The storm finally became extratropical on June 13 just northeast of Flint, Michigan and was absorbed by a larger system the next day.|$|E
