The study also addresses {{the question of whether the}} business cycle influences the reaction in the stock market to <b>layoff</b> announcements. The findings suggest that there is a business cycle influence. The <b>layoff</b> announcements are also categorized and analyzed by several other criteria.

This Paper brings out the economic forces at work and explains the disparate results.

Additional adverse employment effects can arise through {{an increase in the}} effective bargaining strength of workers. These forces explain why <b>layoff</b> costs tend to increase employment in search models while the opposite is true in models with employment lotteries.

40|$|General {{equilibrium}} {{analyses of}} <b>layoff</b> costs have had mixed messages on {{the implications for}} employment. This paper brings out the economic forces at work in different frameworks and explains the disparate results. Since private agents perceive <b>layoff</b> costs as equivalent to a less productive technology, these costs tend to have negative employment effects in models with employment lotteries where the number of employed can be reduced at a low cost to individual agents because of the collective sharing of aggregate consumption. In search models where agents are left to fend for themselves, <b>layoff</b> costs have the opposite tendency of lowering unemployment when such costs {{reduce the amount of}} labor reallocation. Lower frictional unemployment is thus attained at the cost of a less efficient labor allocation. Matching models have this very same tendency under the assumption that <b>layoff</b> costs do not alter the relative split of the match surplus between firms and workers. In contrast, if <b>layoff</b> costs increase workers' relative share of the surplus, matching models tend to post sharp increases in unemployment in response to <b>layoff</b> costs. <b>Layoff</b> costs; unemployment...|$|R

40|$|Starting with {{a simple}} benchmark, we first derive the {{characteristics}} of optimal employment protection. In the benchmark, employment protection {{takes the form of}} <b>layoff</b> taxes, used to finance unemployment benefits. We then consider a number of extensions, and show how this principle must be modified and refined, but not abandoned. We then turn to the employment protection system in place in France today, and show that it differs from this principle in two main dimensions. First, contributions by firms to the unemployment insurance fund take the form of payroll taxes rather than <b>layoff</b> taxes. Second, the <b>layoff</b> process is subject to heavy administrative and judicial control. This leads us to make two main recommendations for reform: The introduction of a <b>layoff</b> tax, with a corresponding decrease in the payroll tax; and a reduced role of the judicial system in the <b>layoff</b> process. ∗ This paper is an english adaptation of a report written for the French Conseil d’Analys...|$|R
