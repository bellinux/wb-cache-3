5000|$|In 1974, Charles Mack {{proposed}} a two-phase construction history for the palace based upon {{his interpretation of}} property descriptions contained in the tax declarations of Giovanni Rucellai, members of his family, and neighbors. [...] In these tax records, the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> is defined by naming adjacent features be they streets or neighbors. Mack, thus, was able to reconstruct ownership histories for the site now occupied by the palace for pertinent tax year. What Mack discovered substantiates Giovanni Rucellai' own testimony that [...] "out of eight houses, I made one."

50|$|Capitalization rates, or cap rates, {{provide a}} tool for investors to use for roughly valuing a {{property}} based on its Net Operating Income. For example, if a real estate investment provides $160,000 a year in Net Operating Income and similar properties have sold based on 8% cap rates, the subject property can be roughly valued at $2,000,000 because $160,000 divided by 8% (0.08) equals $2,000,000. A comparatively higher cap rate for a property would indicate greater risk associated with the investment (decreasing demand for the product, and the corresponding value), and a comparatively lower cap rate for a property might indicate less risk (increased demand for the product). Some factors considered in assessing risk include creditworthiness of a tenant, term of lease, quality and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> and general volatility of the market.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the {{property}} types diversification strategy of Malaysian REITs. Previous study has found that Malaysian REITs received poor response form investors both local and international. Furthermore, the underperformance of Malaysian REITs was linked to the characteristics of REITs' property types and REITs' portfolio influenced its financial performance. The lack of local study on both of these determinants of influence on performance of Malaysian REITs is a research gap, which needs to be explored that can provide more insight of it. This study showed that the property types such as office space, commercial lot, industrial, hotel and specialized property type are the important determinants, which can influence the performance of REITs. The study comprised of REITs data from 2010 until 2014, and through Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) reveals there is little influence of property types diversification strategy toward Malaysian REITs' performance. Nevertheless, by employ correlation analysis between each of the five property types with expected return and dividend yield, this study shows Malaysian REITs' performance of dividend yield(DY) has a positive correlation value with commercial lot property type and Malaysian REITs' performance of expected return(ER) have a highest positive correlation value with industrial property types. Also, this study suggests that property type diversification play a significant role in Malaysia REITs.

40|$|M. Comm. Just as a {{portfolio}} of shares needs to be managed constantly to yield the best return, {{a portfolio}} <b>of</b> <b>property</b> investments {{also needs to be}} managed on a continuous basis for the same reason. Until recently, most institutional property investors didn't have this approach. Properties were managed as assets, and not as investments. One reason for this was that until recently investors could not invest outside South Africa, which caused institutional investors to invest relatively large percentages of their total assets in fixed properties. Investors were caught off guard by changes in the market, and as a result they have properties in their portfolios that are no longer performing well as investments. Institutional investors are now trying to reduce their exposure to <b>properties.</b> The objective <b>of</b> the {{study was to determine the}} factors that a property portfolio manager must consider to maximize the return of the portfolio at an acceptable risk. From these factors a questionnaire was developed to evaluate an individual building. The questionnaire was linked to a decision tree by means of a points system. The decision tree can be used by the portfolio manager as a qualitative decision making tool to enhance the property portfolio. According to the points scored, a general classification is given to the building (A-grade to E-grade), as well as on the location, technical aspects, profitability, and potential <b>of</b> the <b>property.</b> There are five possible outcomes to the decision tree: keep the property in the portfolio; keep the property in the portfolio, but do the necessary upgrading; keep the property in the portfolio, do the upgrading, but sell within five years; sell the property as soon as possible; and demolish the existing building, and redevelop the property. The most important criterion for enhancing the portfolio, is the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the specific <b>property.</b> If the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the <b>property</b> is classified as "A-grade", the property will be kept in the portfolio, except when the technical classification <b>of</b> the <b>property</b> is "E-grade", in which case the building is demolished, and the property redeveloped. If the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the <b>property</b> is classified as "B-grade", the property will be kept and upgraded if the technical classification is not lower than "B-grade". If the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the <b>property</b> is classified as "B-grade", and the technical classification is "C-grade", the portfolio manager should look at the profitability and potential of the building. If the profitability and potential of the <b>of</b> the <b>property</b> is classified as "C-grade" or better, the property should be upgraded, and sold within five years. If the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the <b>property</b> is classified as "C-grade" or lower, the property should be sold as soon as possible. The portfolio manager should bear in mind that the decision tree does not take economic conditions (for example supply and demand in the property market) and the investor's portfolio enhancement strategy (for example to reduce the portfolio's exposure to a certain type <b>of</b> <b>property),</b> into account. However, the decision tree can be applied to give the portfolio manager an indication whether a specific property should be kept or sold...|$|R
